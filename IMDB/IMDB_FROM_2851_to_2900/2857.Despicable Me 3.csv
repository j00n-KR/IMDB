0,TheLittleSongbird,"Not a despicable delight, but hardly despicable in quality at the same time",6,24 July 2017,"The first two 'Despicable Me' films were fantastic family fun, but, despite absolutely loving the scene-stealing minions 'Minions' was underwhelming (giving the sense, though in all fairness they were not well utilised in their own film, that the minions are better as supporting characters rather than leading).'Despicable Me 3' is a disappointment after the first two films but is better than 'Minions'. There is a lot to like about it, but it does feel very uneven and gives the sense that the 'Despicable Me' franchise has somewhat run its course. None of it reaches terrible depths though, just that the film could have been much better considering what came before it.Once again, the animation is wonderful. There are rich bright colours, lovingly and appealingly designed characters (nothing looks awkward like some of the human character designs in 'Minions'), meticulously detailed backgrounds and some real visual invention. 'Despicable Me 3' boasts a killer soundtrack that makes one nostalgic for the 80s (with Michael Jackson and Madonna), Heitor Pereira's score is suitably funky and Pharrell Williams' own contribution (especially the heartfelt and cute ""There's Something Special"") is note-worthy too.Some of the writing is witty, sharp and smart and there are some wildly funny and beautifully timed sight gags. One cannot say that 'Despicable Me 3' doesn't have any heart either, there are some sweet and touching moments here. The characters are likable, especially Gru and the minions (who once again steal scenes despite being underused somewhat), and the voice acting is excellent, Steve Carrell has still got it and proves that with good material and with a good character (like with Gru) he is a very talented comic actor (though he has shown a wider range than that too).However, other parts of the humour comes over in a scatter-shot way and suffer from a flabbiness and predictability. To me the villain was also a little bland, didn't find him particularly memorable or that much of a threat, and some of the soundtrack is compromised by the humour coming by so thick and fast that a few of the songs don't register or don't feel necessary.The most problematic aspects are the story and the pacing. The pacing occasionally is perfect but at some points it feels tired and at many other points it's almost too hyper-active and jumpy so a lot of the film feels rushed. The story suffers from being over-stuffed and bloated, it's basically three or four plots stuffed into one and not enough time is spent with either. The focus jumps around a lot with some of the transitions on the choppy side so the film and the story-line can feel disjointed.Overall, not a bad film at all but was expecting better considering how good the first two 'Despicable Me' films are. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Despicable Me 3
1,SnoopyStyle,bad franchise management,6,15 May 2018,"Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker) had been a child star portraying a lovable villain in the 80s. After losing his job, he decided to become a villain for real. Gru (Steve Carell) and Lucy (Kristen Wiig) stops Bratt from stealing the world's largest diamond. When the AVL change leadership, they get fired. The Minions abandon after Gru refused to revert to villainy. Gru is told that he has twin brother Dru who is a pig tycoon on the island nation of Freedonia. Dru reveals their late father's super villain persona and wants Gru to teach him the ways of a villain.I still like the characters despite this less-than-stellar outing. It's shocking that the movie without credits is no more than 80 minutes. This feels like a rushed job. I even like Bratt. If not for the love of these characters, I would consider this a failure. As a character, Dru holds some interesting promise. For that promise to be realised, he needs to turn evil. In fact, that should be the plot of this movie. Once Dru is introduced, that turn becomes fully expected and it should be executed sooner rather than later. Despite liking Bratt, I would prefer putting him in cold storage and first developing a better story for Dru. This is a misstep in franchise management.",Despicable Me 3
2,Hitchcoc,An Homage to the Eighties,6,11 May 2018,"While there are several interesting things going on at a rapid fire rate, there seems to be no real center to this thing. Even in an animated film, we want a story and characters that we recognize. The animation is awesome and I enjoyed the Mean Kid actor and his adult incarnation. I quickly became bored with the minions. They have no soul or interest to me.",Despicable Me 3
3,Horst_In_Translation,Series improves back to (almost) the original quality,6,7 August 2017,"Here we got ""Despicable Me 3"" and the title already gives away that this is the third entry to the successful film series already, actually the 4th if you count the Minions movie too. Let me begin this review by saying I quite enjoyed the first, liked the second and did not like the Minions movie. But this one here is better again, overall roughly on the same level like DM2. If you check out the names who made this, you fill find writers and directors who worked on this franchise in the past already and this certainly includes Pierre Coffin who voices the Minions as always, the little yellow creatures that the audiences love the most about these films. I like them too, but only as supporting characters it seems and in a great number. But this franchise badly needs all the human characters too. This film here that is not too long at 90 minutes brings back a trio of new characters, namely a new villain, a new family member and a new boss. About the latter, we don't need to say much as she only had two scenes and one of them was just another character's fantasy. But the villain here, a former child actor gone bad as he believes he really is the fictitious character from his youth, was a solid addition and he looked certainly much more stupid in the trailer than he eventually turned out. Yeah the dancing was a bit ridiculous, but his scenes early on with some catchy tunes and the final scenes with the big robot were kinda nice and well done I guess. In DM2 we have to wait for a long time to find out who the bad guy is, but here we find out in the very first scene, even before Gru shows up. And then there is Gru's twin brother Dru, a man who dreams of being a super villain, but he is just too harmless and cannot really be taken seriously as an antagonist. This also can be seen in the very last scene when we have him run off with the Minions to commit some crimes, but I doubt he will be the antagonist in the next movie. He is just too clumsy. Still he brought some entertaining moments in his scenes with Gru and I believe he was a good addition too. And he brought pigs and pigs are the most amazing creatures on the planet (sorry Minions). Actually, there is a parallel to Gru too. Gru has his Minions, Dru got his pigs and these were one of the film's highlights.2 of the girls get their stories too as one is in search of a unicorn and the other meets a boy hopelessly falling for her. But as the feeling is not mutual, Lucy needs to step in and she was probably the one character that did not do too much for me in this film as her plot about becoming a mother to the three girls was maybe the most forgettable. Also the brother bond part was not too convincing, but they still gave that one up fairly quickly in terms of conflict I would say. The girls' plots were fine, the Minions' plot was mediocre. The jokes when wee see them in prison being badass were quite funny, but when they are up in the air, it is not too entertaining. But yeah, I guess they are too big now to just appear next to Gru occasionally. Overall, I found this to be a quite enjoyable 1.5-hour film and judging from the quality here, I would not mind a 4th DM at some point. I think audience figures may not have been as huge as for the first two, but probably good enough for a sequel. In terms of reception, it seems that people and critics also liked it less than the previous two, so an Oscar nomination seems rather unlikely, but we'll see. I for once am glad it is better than the Minions movie and I hope the next Minions movie (probably released in 2020) will be as good as this one here. It's not too likely though I guess. DM3 gets a thumbs-up from me and it is a worthy entertaining addition to the franchise.",Despicable Me 3
4,Prismark10,Brother its you.,5,25 March 2018,"There is nothing much wrong with Despicable Me 3 if you are a kid. If you are an adult I think the charm is fading a bit and as far as the plot goes, so does originality. I think this is another cartoon where an incident happened to someone in childhood which drove them into becoming a supervillain in adulthood.Balthazar Bratt an 80s child actor had his hit television show cancelled when his voice broke. Out of the limelight, he really imagined himself as a villain with hit 80s music as an accompaniment. Now he is one causing bubblegum mayhem.Gru and Lucy fail to capture him once again but get the diamond that Bratt stole. Not good enough for the new boss of the Anti Villain League who fires both of them.Gru finds out that he has a long lost twin brother called, Dru and his dad was a super villain. Gru travels to the country of Freedonia and Dru is just like Gru but with hair, more cheerful, a bit incompetent and wants to follow a life of crime. He persuades Gru go get back to being a bad guy which is something the Minions failed to do as they walked out on him and ended up in jail.Gru and Dru steal back the diamond from Bratt but Bratt takes the children and is off to destroy Hollywood for destroying his career.It is all rather scattergun as there are various plot threads to get its core audience excited about but it is also rather vapid.",Despicable Me 3
5,nogodnomasters,I have two words for you...Dance Fight!,10,25 July 2017,"As a good guy, agent Gru gets an arch enemy in Balthazar Bratt, a deposed teen star who holds a grudge against Hollywood. Gru discovers he has a twin brother and together they team up to stop Bratt and do some bonding along the way. The girls and Minions provide some subplots.I had to laugh. Fun for adults and kids. Great 80's tunes. Makes fun of Hollywood action films.Closest thing to swearing was ""son of a beta-max"" and the minions say ""boobs"" and who knows what else.",Despicable Me 3
6,kosmasp,Despicable 2,5,4 September 2017,"No I know it's the third one (or fourth one if you count the standalone Minions movie), but I'm talking about the new ""character"" in this. I do wonder if Steve Carrell got twice as much money this time around. And don't be too depressed by my rating. This still works, especially for kids but some might argue for their parents or adults in general.It's just not as good as the standard the first one set. And if you were appalled by the fact that the minions got a standalone movie, I don't think you will watch this anyway (though how do you feel about the Emoji movie I wonder?). All kidding aside and with some added Minion adventure to accompany the main story (it's nice it gets separated, sort of like Ice Age does with it's Critter that goes nuts solo), So enjoy this for what it is and especially enjoy the music! It's really good and while there might not be a ""Happy"" song, there are enough similar sounding ones all there to guarantee an uplifting mood ...",Despicable Me 3
7,Sleepin_Dragon,Bonkers fun.,8,26 December 2017,"The first two films were exceptional, and were always going to be a tough act to follow, but I thought they were followed particularly well with this one. It was huge fun, wonderfully over the top, great laughs for kids and adults. A bonkers plot which was loaded with jokes, and the introduction of his brother provided most of the laughs, the Minions were great fun as usual. Very touching at times too. I've read a forth is in the pipeline, I wonder if that will be it, they've been great. 8/10",Despicable Me 3
8,jboothmillard,Despicable Me 3,7,12 August 2017,"The first film in the computer animated film franchise was enjoyable, as was its first sequel, and prequel movie Minions was alright, the original trilogy gets completed with this third entry. Basically former super villain Gru (Steve Carell) is now an agent for the Anti- Villain League (AVL), alongside agent and now wife Lucy (Kristen Wiig), they are working together to foil the plans of the next super villain. Balthazar Bratt (South Park's Trey Parker), a former 80s child star turned evil genius, is their latest target, they manage to stop him stealing a very expensive diamond, but they fail to capture him, meaning that Gru and Lucy are fired from AVL by mean director Valerie Da Vinci (Jenny Slate), following the retirement of Silas Ramsbottom (Steve Coogan). Gru and Lucy reluctantly tell the kids, Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier) and Agnes (Nev Scharrel), about losing their jobs, but assure them they will find new ones soon, most of the Minions leave when Gru refuses to return to villainy, as they are bored being the good guys, meanwhile Lucy struggles with the responsibility of being a mother to the children. The next morning, the family is approached by a man named Fritz (also Coogan), a butler, he informs Gru that his father has died, and that he has a twin brother named Dru, Gru doesn't believe a word as his mother Marlena (Julie Andrews) told him his father passed away as a child. Gru confronts his mother, she admits that she and his father divorced, they decided to each take one of the twins, she thinks she got second pick, despite this, Gru is amazed to know he has a twin brother. Gru, Lucy and the girls are flown to the island of Fredonia, they are surprised by the immense wealth of Dru, attributed to a pig farm business, Dru, is a spitting image of Gru, but with flowing blonde hair, while they get to know each other, Lucy takes the girls to explore the island. Meanwhile, the Minions are arrested for trespassing into a movie studio and intruding a singing talent competition set, while Bratt manages to steal the diamond once again, he intends to use it to power a giant robot to get revenge on Hollywood for cancelling his TV show. Dru reveals to Gru their father was a legendary super villain, Dru was constantly dismissed by their father as a disgrace, he longs to continue the family tradition and pull of a great villainous act, but Gru refuses to revert to his old ways. Dru decides to take Gru on a joyride in their father's highly technological car, the siblings start to bond, meanwhile Lucy and the girls are in the middle of a traditional cheese festival, Margo has young boy Niko (Adrian Ciscato) displaying affection for her, while Edith and Agnes learn from a local tavern owner a mythical unicorn lurks in the nearby forest. Gru almost tries to convince Agnes that unicorns are imaginary, but doesn't want to hurt her feelings, the next day Agnes and Edith go to the woods to find the mythical creature, only to find a one- horned goat, Agnes takes it to her heart. Meanwhile the Minions using aggressive tactics have exerted control over the other prisoners at their jail, but their longing for Gru motivates them to plan and execute an escape from the prison.

The escaped Minions rendezvous with Gru and destroy the gum already covering the city, Gru and Dru reunite, soon after Gru and Lucy are reinstated in the AVL, Lucy is acknowledged by the children as their mother, Dru steals Gru's ship, accompanied by the Minions, planning to do something dastardly, but Gru and Lucy decide to give him a five minute head start. Also starring Pierre Coffin as Minions, Michael Beattie as TV Show Host and Andy Nyman as Clive the Robot. As before Carell remains really funny with his crazy James Bond style villain accent, playing both the twins, the grouchy one and the charming and cheerful one, Wiig is fine, and Parker is amusing as the villain, the story of a new twin brother could have been hit or miss, thankfully the script, great sight gags and a catchy soundtrack of 80s music from the likes of Michael Jackson, Madonna and a-ha, as before the yellow pill shaped Minions almost steal the show with their cuteness and gobbledygook language, who would've guessed that they would spawn into so much merchandising, you could say they have taken over the world, this is a funny and enjoyable family animated comedy. Very good!",Despicable Me 3
9,michaelRokeefe,Laughs for the kids and smiles for the grown folks.,6,14 January 2018,"Gru (Steve Carell) has lost his job with the Anti-Villain League and soon after a total stranger arrives with news of Dru, his long-lost twin brother. Dru has lived a very successful life, thus plunging Gru into a major identity crisis. Dru anxiously wishes to follow in his brother's despicable footsteps. Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker), a former child star trying to relive his former character, remains to be Gru's most formidable nemesis to date. The chrome-dome with pointed nose realizes his life still has purpose. Gru's daughters--Margo, Edith and Agnes, are always up for adventure. Oh yes, the Minions are required to make a prison break (yes, prison break) to join in a new adventure.Laughs are contagious. But the franchise may be getting close to going stale. The typical childish jokes and silly antics of the lovable minions provide everything you expect. A very nice soundtrack features: Pharrell Williams, A-HA, Dire Straits, Madonna, Berlin and Michael Jackson.Other starring voices: Kristen Wiig, Miranda Cosgrove, Nev Scharrel, Dana Gaier, Russell Brand, Steve Coogan, Jennie Slate, Pierre Coffin and Julie Andrews.",Despicable Me 3
10,studioAT,"It was perfectly fine entertainment, but they should stop now",5,8 August 2017,"While I think this franchise is slowly going downhill in terms of quality (I didn't like Minions) 'Despicable Me 3' remains a decent piece of family entertainment, that will delight many this summer holiday.The problem, as with any sequel is that it is trying to keep a lot of characters busy, and to keep adding more drama than the film that came before it in the series.While this third film does that I felt that Lucy/Edith and even the Minions themselves were slightly underused, and that the novelty of having essentially two Gru's wasn't that amusing after a while.Having said all that it does contain some funny moments and was entertaining throughout. Sometimes though you just feel that a series has run its course.",Despicable Me 3
11,grantss,Should have stopped after Minions,3,26 March 2018,"Balthazar Bratt was a child TV star in the 1980s but turned to a life of crime when his career ended after he hit puberty.

Gru is so desperate he considers returning to a life of crime. Discovering that he has a twin brother, Dru, Gru teams up with Dru with the aim of stealing the world's largest diamond.I liked the first two Despicable Me movies, and the Minions movie. None of them were brilliant, having a basic, largely predictable plot and not being exactly laugh-a-minute but they were did have a lot of heart and were funny enough to be entertaining. Overall they were reasonably good fun.With Despicable Me 3, the writers have clearly run out of ideas. Plot is even more basic, just being one escapade after another, with a random, haphazard structure. Jokes are few and far between. The natural sweetness and innocence which made the other three movies so enjoyable are missing, replaced by a rather superficial cutesiness. They really should have ended the series after Minions.",Despicable Me 3

Universal suggests that ALL of these Rumpster Minions MUST BE incarcerated for the treasonous traitors that they are, until they can be deported by blimp to Backwards Galaxies Far, Far Away such as Russia, Mongolia, Australia, and the Northwest Territories, areas more suitable to their Medievally Feudal World View.",Despicable Me 3
13,neil-476,Good fun,8,9 May 2018,"Gru is fired from the Anti-Villain League for his failure to capture child-star turned villain Benjamin Bratt, and Lucy also leaves as a gesture of solidarity. The Minions quit, because Gru refuses to return to villainy. Gru discovers he has a wealthy and successful long-lost brother Dru, the white to his black, but it remains to be seen whether the brothers will get on with each other.After two previous movies and a Minions stand-alone, we pretty much know what to expect from the Despicable Me Universe. A lot of knockabout slapstick humour, imaginative and funny animation, excellent voicework, an emphasis on family, and a plot which sets Gru's despicable tendencies against more important values. And that's exactly what we get here. So what makes number 3 different from what came before?Two things. The first is that Steve Carrell gets to do Dru as well as Gru (not the easiest of things to say. Fortunately, I'm typing it, not saying it). You can hear the fun Carell is having, especially when the two brothers pretend to be each other, fooling nobody at all.The second is Trey Parker, playing Benjamin Bratt exactly as if he was a South Park character ie. miles over the top. Now it may seem like foolish to point out something over the top in a film which has hundreds of little yellow idiots in it. But the main characters usually play the voices straight, which contrasts nicely with the outrageous visuals. However, Parker's voice performance here is absolutely perfect.There is quite a lot of plot here, and the Minions are sidelined somewhat, but as a result they are all the more welcome when they do show up. And, as usual, they are a hoot. There are loads of sight gags, especially centred around dancing. Many are blink-and-you'll-miss-'em,so keep your eyes peeled.The 3D is pretty good.This is fun, the kids will love it, and I liked it too.",Despicable Me 3
14,Mr-Fusion,"The weakest of the three, but I liked it",6,29 June 2017,"I tend to be pretty easy to please with these movies but, believe it or not, the Minions carry ""Despicable Me 3"". And that's with Steve Carell pulling double duty as Gru and Dru. But the twin brother angle (as well as Trey Parker's stuck-in- the-'80s bad guy) is pretty weak sauce. There's no getting around that.That said, the yellow guys were funny as always, and Agnes injected just the right sweetness to keep me invested. It's a hit with my seven year-old, so I guess that's probably all that needs to be said.6/10",Despicable Me 3
15,Hellmant,Probably worth seeing if your kids were fans of the first two movies too.,5,7 July 2017,"'DESPICABLE ME 3': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The 3rd installment in the blockbuster computer-animated comedy series (the 4th counting a Minions spin off). It was directed by Pierre Coffin and Kyle Balda (Coffin also co-directed the 1st two movies as well) and it was once again written by Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio (they also co-wrote the 1st two installments). Steve Carell returns to play the infamous super-villain turned hero Gru (for his 3rd time in the role), Kristen Wiig reprises her role (from the last film) as Lucy Wilde (Gru's new wife in this installment), and Trey Parker (of 'SOUTH PARK' fame) joins the cast as a former 80s child star turned super-villain named Balthazar Bratt. Coffin also once again voices most of the Minions, Russell Brand returns to voice Gru's elderly gadget man Dr. Nefario, and Jenny Slate, Steve Coogan, and Julie Andrews also voice roles in the film as well. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's also been a hit at the Box Office so far. I enjoyed the first movie (if I remember correctly), but I haven't thought much of it's sequels (or spinoffs) so far (including this one).Gru (Carell) is now an agent of the AVL (Anti-Villain League), and he's also married to his fellow agent Lucy Wilde (Wiig); who's also now the new adoptive mother of Gru's three adopted daughters. The film opens with Gru and Lucy stopping the theft of a very expensive diamond, by the super-villain Balthazar Bratt (Parker); a former 80s child star obsessed with revenge against Hollywood (for the cancellation of his show many years earlier). Due to the fact that the duo is unable to capture Bratt (repeatedly), they're fired by the new AVL director (Slate). While Gru and Lucy are trying to figure out new work options, the Minions all quit, and Gru discovers he has a rich twin brother named Dru (also voiced by Carell). Gru decides to take his family to meet Dru, and Bratt steals the diamond successfully this time. Bratt then plans to use the diamond to destroy Hollywood, and it's up to Gru, Dru and Lucy to stop him. Gru and Dru of course bond in the process, and Gru discovers his father was also an infamous super-villain.The movie is mildly amusing, like the second film, but it's not as clever or as witty as I remember the original being (although I've only seen it once, years ago). I do think it's probably a decent movie for kids though, and adults will (most likely) find it mildly amusing too (some might really like it). I think it's a little annoying that films like this are so huge at the Box Office though, when there's much better quality animation and kids' movies out there to see. Still, I can't give the film too bad of a review; it's definitely decent, and the cast all does adequate jobs in their roles. It's probably worth seeing if your kids were fans of the first two movies too.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/226937840",Despicable Me 3

The best scenes are quite good, but it is weak compared to the first two, and the quality is closer to that of offshoot Minions.The script feels a little jumbled, hopping here and there without creating a clear sense of momentum. The idea for the villain is cute but there's not much to him beyond the fondness for the disco, and he feels unformidable.Still, it's cute, it's funny, and it's good enough to make me hope for a DM4.",Despicable Me 3

Yet 'Despicable Me 3 (2017)', which clearly suffers from the aforementioned issue and even has to resort to finding increasingly abstract ways to shoehorn in the now irrelevant minions, also has arguably the best villain of the three, a grown-up child-star who's motivations are exaggerated but believable, and a climactic battle that actually involves some proper slapstick fisticuffs, for once. Still, it's all surface and just another excuse to make a bunch of juvenile jokes that play only to the youngest of the audience and further accentuate its cartoon aesthetic and sensibilities. The plot truly comes second here, as some fairly nice character elements are discarded just as quickly as they are introduced, and the whole affair once again unfolds without any real audience engagement. 5/10",Despicable Me 3

I'm glad they took a backseat to the more interesting characters. I really associated with Lucy more here. The best part is probably hearing Trey Parker actually work on a kid's movie. In fact, I think he was planning on doing a project like that earlier, but it was cancelled. I admit that's the film's main selling point for me simply because I love him so much. For the most part, this film is funny but it certainly has its faults. This movie features Lucy and Gru being fired for not catching Bratt, the Trey Parker villain.The new boss of their organization shares Pony Head's voice actress! She barely appeared at all and I just wanted to hear that voice. When they get the diamond back, we don't even see them present it to her. I really thought that could have been done better. Still, we get some nice laughs and really detailed animation. We even get a brief talk about divorce which I have to admit is quite courageous for anything kid related. I still find the first to be the best and honestly, I think this might be a little better than the second one. While by no means a great movie, still enjoyable.

Meanwhile, Gru's jaundiced henchmen serve out their prison sentence.The second sequel to the middling original, this latest installment feels more like an episode of a Saturday morning cartoon than a 3-D feature.

The third installment in the 'Despicable Me' franchise was highly disappointing!",5,2 December 2018,"This is a shame, because I like the first two movies of the same name, very much. 2010's 'Despicable Me' had a cute, but surprisingly, not creepy single fatherhood story of an over the top villain, Gru (Voiced by Steve Carrell) adopting three young children, at first to do his evil's bidding, but grew affection with them, Margo (Voiced by Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Voiced by Dana Gaier), & Agnes (Voiced by Elsie Fischer in the original movies and Nev Scharrel in the third film) over time. While, its 2013's sequel, explore motherhood, by having the same scoundrel fall in love with a secret agent, Lucy Wilde (Voiced by Kristen Wiig) forming more on a intimate bond for those children. In the end, you would have thought, the same core home some values would continue, with this movie directed by Pierre Coffin and Kyle Balda, a little more, with an introduction to a new half-sibling, which the kids could had mixed feelings about, however, the main focus on the film co directed by Eric Guillon went to an another direction. Written by Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio, the third film choose to spend, most of its time having Gru teams up with his long lost twin brother Dru (Also Voiced by Steve Carrell) in order to stop, a new enemy, former child actor, Balthazar Bratt (Voiced by Trey Parker) from destroying Hollywood. Without spoiling the film, you would think, this would story arch, would explore more of problems of human bonding between siblings during years of separate and the buildup of frustration, both may have, for each other's parents. However, the movie doesn't really get that complex or emotional. Instead, it shy away from such topics, making the movie, a little too simpleton for my taste. Don't get me wrong, there is still conflict, but it doesn't have the punch, needed to make the movie work. A good example of this, was the subplot of Lucy trying to solve feelings about the previous relationship and anticipating childrearing changes with Margo. You would think, this would get a main focus, however, it's quickly resolved, and doesn't really factor, into the main plot, involving Gru. Much in the same way, that Agnes's story about hunting unicorns & the Minions rebellion was nearly pointless. It felt highly bland, and most of all, not needed. Seeing how the last movie, also explore, the same subjects. They are there, just for padding to make sure the movie goes at least a 90-minute runtime. It was very unsatisfying. In addition to that, the main story just as much of a mess, as the film's subplots. 'Despicable 3' had a lot of confusing plot holes that were a little too wide to ignore, like how could the brothers, never met each other, until now. It's really hard to believe. To add on that, how did Gru not know that his father was a legendary supervillain, seeing how he works for the Anti Villain League and went to Villain-Con in the prequel film 2015's 'Minions'? I guess, if the head of AVL, Valeria da Vinci (Voiced by Jenny Slate) didn't know who Gru was? I guess, it would be possible, that Gru didn't know him. Still, things like this, doesn't make sense. Another jarring question to add to that, is how could Balthazar and Gru know, each other's hide out, if they never went there? Also, how Balthazar did even get funding for his lair? The Evil Bank? Things like that, are especially frustrating, considering just how entertaining the visual action confrontations are between all of the characters. Despite that, the animation for this film was outstanding. As for the voice acting, Trey Parker does a good job, here, even if some of the voices felt recycled from his TV show 'South Park'. Let's just say that Parker is one of the last people you'd expect to voice a character in a family movie. As for Carell; his double dose was fine, even if it was highly annoying at parts. Glad, Carell took the challenge of playing such roles. However, the rest of the cast was highly forgettable & felt wasted. As for the Minions. They are so darn adorable, but really can't stand their chipmunk like noises after so long. They are annoying and weren't really that funny at all. As for the jokes, there is a lot of slapstick humor that some children will love, and some adult might enjoy like the lowrider driver getting smashed into a building. Very funny, but is the jerk still alive? Regardless, others were mostly a miss for me. It didn't hit my funny bone. The same, can be, said, with the insider Hollywood animation jokes. The subtle jab reference to Disney's 2003's film 'Finding Nemo' was not funny. The same can be said with the talent show, the minions appear in, the middle of the film. Even the 1980s cultural references were a miss. I really have no clue, if this generation of children would understand, that type of a humor. Still, it should appeal to Gen X & Y parents. I kinda dig the jab at Donald Trump. As for the music, it didn't shine, as much as the last movie, as Pharrell Williams' score was underused in the film. Instead, the movie went with the more popular route, with the expensive 1980s music hits like Michael Jackson, Madonna, and others to maintain a certain amount of momentum. However, overall, I still didn't like this movie. While this animation film might not be despicable enough to turn off. It still barely watchable. It's not worth, going bananas over!",Despicable Me 3
23,Platypuschow,Despicable Me 3: Inferior but enjoyable,7,19 June 2018,"Okay fine I'll admit it I'm a big Despicable Me fan and I love minions, don't judge me!I thought both of the first two Despicable Me movies were fantastic and to a lesser extent enjoyed Minions (2015) so logically I was going to enjoy this, but did I?Well it has the same charm, it has the great voice talent, it has a stellar soundtrack and it has minions! What is there to dislike?Well I don't dislike it but truth be told it's not on par with the other movies, I don't know quite what it was but I just wasn't feeling it this time as a lot of the jokes missed their mark, the minions took a backseat and the twin brother aspect of the plot was a tad weak.Regardless Despicable Me 3 is a lot of fun for all the family complete with lots of jokes that the parents will appeciate and a great retro 80's soundtrack. Being a big South Park fan I really appreciated the work put into this by Trey Parker, he's a multi-talented fella as demonstrated here.The franchise still has life in it and hopefully won't be going away anytime soon.BANANA!The Good:Great soundtrackSame ol'charmTrey ParkerThe Bad:Story is weaker than previous filmsThings I Learnt From This Movie:Giant titan mechs can be made by one single person in a matter of daysTrey Parker needs more voice workI want a uni-goat!If she doesn't get fluffy back in the next movie I'm rioting.........awkwardly..........by myself",Despicable Me 3
24,Reno-Rangan,It's a family time!,6,14 December 2017,"I'm not a fan of this film, except I always loved Minions, particularly their solo film before this one. That prequel was awesome, so much fun. But it's hard to believe, this franchise has already reached three films/parts. Yeah, the Minions helped to find its place among the animation fans, but in this film they were kind of ignored. That's the truth. They had less screenspace which directly affected the film and those who love them.Gru is set to meet his twin brother, Dru, who is dreaming to be like his father, a supervillain. But now changed Gru is not interested to help his brother. Instead, he uses him to accomplish on what he had failed recently. Okayish story, but it had some good fun. It's almost given a hint about the possible plot for the next sequel. I think kids would enjoy it without expecting much. So a one time watchable film.6/10",Despicable Me 3
25,briancham1994,Fantastic new character,7,3 June 2020,"What a fresh addition to the series, Gru's brother. He steals the show away from Lucy and the girls which some may not like. Balthazar Bratt was a memorable and funny villain.",Despicable Me 3
26,cruise01,Lost its charm that the earlier movies had with less humor and forgettable villain.,5,1 July 2017,"Despicable Me 3 may have reach that limit were most great hilarious characters and humor usually wear off. The minions were the selling point, and they were always amusing and cute with the slapstick humor they pull off. The first two Despicable Me movies were fun to see about a villain turned good who adopted three little girls and tries to save the world for the good guys. This third outing has lost its steam were the plot is no longer engaging, the humor is fewer in between, and at least it still has the colorful entertaining animation. Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) and wife Lucy (Kristen Wiig) are now agents for an Anti-Villain League. While on a mission to stop a villain Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker), who was once a huge TV star as a kid about being a very bad boy. Until the audience grew out of it, and his shows were cancelled. He takes over a big ship by using his dance fighting moves, causing him to get away from Gru and Lucy. Meanwhile, the minions are slowly losing interest in their workforce area with Gru. When they are bored with Gru's new goody good lifestyle. While, they all leave for their own and end up walking to a Hollywood studio and trespassing on a singing talent show. Which lands them into prison. Gru receives an unexpected visit from a butler, who informs Gru that his twin brother Dru wants to see him. Shocked that he had a brother. His three girls Margo, Edith, and Agnes convince him that they should all go to see his brother. Gru meets his brother, who brings him back to the world of being bad by stealing from a candy truck and escaping the police. Lucy meanwhile is growing and learning to be a mother of the three girls. The characters are what made these movies great. The humor and jokes is small and little in between each scene. The minions were cute and has some small fun moments but nothing memorable like the other movies. The villain Balthazar is also forgettable as the bad guy that keeps reminding everyone he is a bad boy. And always breaking into dancing when doing a heist or dance battling his way out. The minions barely have much to do with the movie as well as they spend time in prison in their comedic scene. The third outing in the series may be running out of ideas and creativity before they start becoming easy cash grabs. Like the Shrek series, which became boring at the third movie and out. Same with Ice Age series. Overall, Despicable Me 3 is a miss and lost its charm that the earlier movies had. The characters were once fun and cute. This film lost its humor, boring plot, and the new additions of Dru and the villain were forgettable. I do recommend the film for the kids which they will still love the characters and find it amusing. But for adults, this one was a bit boring.",Despicable Me 3
27,leonblackwood,Preferred the previous movies!,4,2 March 2018,"Review:
I was quite a big fan of the first couple of movies in this franchise, and I enjoyed the Minions movie but this 3rd film didn't really do it for me. The jokes were a bit weak and the I wasn't that impressed with the new characters. The storyline also seemed rushed and slightly messy, and I missed the original Gru (Steve Carell), who was witty and much funnier as the master criminal. Anyway, in this film Gru and his girlfriend, Lucy (Kristen Wiig), are fired from the AVL agency, because they failed to takedown Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker), while he was stealing the largest diamond in the world, even though they managed to save the diamond from the rich super villain. Balthazar used to be a child star, with a hit show on TV but when his show is cancelled, he seeks revenge by destroying Hollywood, with the power of the precious diamond. Now that Gru and Lucy are jobless, and the Minions leave the household because they are bored of living a life away from crime, Lucy tries to get close to the kids, even though she finds it hard playing mummy. Gru then receives a message that he has a brother, so he takes the kids and Lucy to visits his twin. Although Gru and his new found brother, Dru, are complete opposites, they both have an interest in crime, due to there deceased father, so they join forces to take down Balthazar, who manages to steal back the biggest diamond in the world from the agency. While they are dodging all of Balthazar's hidden traps, the brothers bond together, and the Minions come back to help them fight against the dangerous criminal. There are a few touching moments with the kids, and the Minions did make me chuckle but apart from that, I much preferred the previous movies. There wasn't any memorable moments through the whole movie, and the original cast didn't seem to progress from the second film. Anyway, it's worth a watch if your a fan of the previous movies but its not the type of film that I will watch again. That's not to say that it was a total let down, but from an adults point of view, it could have been much better. Watchable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Kyle Balda, 46, who also brought you The Lorax and the Minions movie. It was also directed by Pierre Coffin, 50, who brought you the original Despicable Me and he also directed the original Minions, so it's obvious that this project must have been close to there hearts. With a 4th movie on the cards, it will be good to see how the crazy bunch progress, now that Gru has found his long lost brother, and Balthazar is still at large. I just hope that the writers bring back some of the old humour, which made the franchise so popular in the first place. Although I wasn't a massive fan of this film, it has been the biggest earner in the franchise, and its the 25th biggest movie of all time, beating Jurassic Park believe it or not, so it's not surprising that they are working on a 4th movie.Budget: $80million

28,TheMovieDiorama,Despicable Me 3 is where I draw the line.,4,9 March 2018,"No more, please. This was barely passable. It's a tired franchise that did well and we all enjoyed it to begin with but my God you don't need to wring it the flop out! Illumination clearly just want to make money, and yet creative studios like Laika can only just make their budget. It's a sad world, it really is. Anyway, in this chapter Gru is up against an old nemesis known as Balthazar Bratt, whom is trapped in his own 80's bubblegum bubble, so that he can further his status in the Anti-Villain League. But wait, there's more! Lucy is trying to be a mother to Gru's children and gain their respect. Wait...we're not done yet? The flipping irritating minions leave Gru as he no longer pursues villainy and we follow them in their small mischievous adventure. Surely that's it right? Agnes really wants to find a unicorn for real and tries her best to tame one. Seriously, it's done...*sigh*. Gru finds out he has a twin brother called Dru who has the flamboyancy of a flamingo. Please...no more plots!? Balthazar Bratt wants the diamond so that he can destroy Hollywood. DONE. I'm done. So Illumination learnt that having no plot (The Secret Life of Pets) was bad...so let's include six instead!?! What a mess, I mean it was constantly switching between each plot. Could've made six different sequels, although thank God they didn't. There really wasn't any need for this film to exist, it doesn't further anything than the previous two had already done. No character development whatsoever. I thought some of the voice acting was abit off as well, particularly for the children. The minions are the worst species to ever be conceived in animation and AGAIN are annoying as hell. In fact, hell is less annoying. I however did like the villain and the 80's soundtrack, I could easily relate to that. The animation was fluid and vibrant as well. There are a few scenes of enjoyment and I did smile on certain occasions. But it's not enough to warrant another sequel to a franchise that should just end. Surely...SURELY there cannot be another one...",Despicable Me 3
29,matthewssilverhammer,"I can't tell if these movies are getting worse, or if my tolerance is just waning",3,10 July 2017,"Either way, they're all too innocuous to truly hate. Lowest common denominator in every way: tons of lame jokes, forceful heartfelt moments that aren't earned, and random acts of cuteness. Carell deserves so much better than just being given a tired, silly accent like the worst of Mike Myers.",Despicable Me 3
30,lisafordeay,Not a bad prequel from the Despicable Me franchise,6,21 February 2018,"Despicable Me 3 is the 2nd sequel off the 2012 film and this time GRU(Steve Carrell) finds out he has a twin brother(voiced by the same person) who wants to become a villain like GRU before he married Lucy(Kirsten Wigg) and adopted 3 girls. We are also introduced to a new villain named Blatzar Bratt(Voiced by Trey Parker) who is a former child star from the 80s and is obsessed with 80s fashion and music. He also is a master of disguise as he steals a diamond in disguise as a heavily man. So its up to GRU and Dru to retrieve the diamond and save the day.Overall I enjoyed this film,its not as good as the first two films but if you 80s style music than check it out.6/10",Despicable Me 3
31,dfranzen70,"Not as good as the first, the second, or the Minions one.",6,11 February 2019,"Although this probably could have used more Minions (shudder), it's still pretty good. The characters are still fun, the comedy is light and appropriate for adults and kids, and the voice work is spot on. The entire Gru tale has probably run its course (evil to good, good plus new partner, good to bad to good), but I think it's fair to say that if you liked the first ones, you'll be fine with this as well. But I think most of us wanna see Minions 2. Maybe, to light a spark, the next one could have Gru engaging in parental responsibilities, like bake sales, Girl Scout Cookies, and so on.",Despicable Me 3
32,stevendbeard,Fun To Watch,7,2 July 2017,"I saw ""Despicable Me 3"", starring the voices of Steve Carell-Foxcatcher, Hope Springs; Kristen Wiig-Ghostbusters_2016, The Martian; Trey Parker- BASEketball, Orgazmo and Julie Andrews-Julie's Greenroom_tv, Tooth Fairy.This is the 3rd in the series-4th if you count the solo Minions movie- and it has all the qualities from the franchise you are familiar with, plus two new characters. Steve/Gru is reformed from his evil villainy days and is now a government agent tracking down evil villains with his wife, Kristen. Trey plays one of the new characters-Balthazar Bratt-a former child star from the 1980's that has decided to get revenge against Hollywood because of the way he was treated-his show was canceled when he grew out of it. Steve/Gru gets fired after his latest attempt fails in apprehending Trey and that's about when he finds out that he has a twin brother named Dru-also voiced by Steve and this is the second new character that I mentioned, earlier. Steve visits his mother, voiced by Julie, and confirms his twins' existence and also discovers that Dru is a want-a-be villain. He wants Gru to teach him how to be better at it so he can carry on the family tradition. Since Gru is no longer a bad guy, his Minions leave him, but don't worry, it is just so that they can have their own solo adventures-they are pretty funny when they wind up in prison. Trey is also fun to watch; since he is a child of the 80's, he loves the music and styles from that era, including having a mullet, wearing a purple suit and using bubblegum and lasers as weapons. There are some scenes during the end credits but nothing at the very end. It's rated ""PG"" for action and rude humor and has a running time of 1 hour & 30 minutes. If you liked the previous movies-I did-then you should enjoy this one too. I would buy it on DVD.",Despicable Me 3
33,drqshadow-reviews,"Silly, Light Fun with Gru's Old Crew, Plus a Few New Faces",6,13 November 2017,"Gru, his family and the minions are back to make a new friend and confront a new foil. This time, the opposition is former child star Balthazar Bratt, stranded deep in the 1980s, who takes out frustrations about an ancient sitcom cancellation on jewel owners and Hollywood big-spenders alike. Played with energy by Trey Parker and swathed in a dense cloak of pop culture references, Bratt brings a fresh new dynamic to the franchise that gives this third installment just enough of a boost to feel necessary. Most of those cultural winks were completely lost on my kids, of course, but they still appreciated his silly wardrobe, fly dance-fighting moves and crafty arsenal of unlikely weapons. There's a side story with Gru's forgotten twin brother Dru (both played by Steve Carell, of course), and a sweet arc that finds Kristin Wiig's special agent Lucy seeking a relationship with the reformed villain's three girls, but those feel like slight retreads and don't have the new criminal's panache. Clearly, Illumination was having a good time with Bratt, while the other plot threads were more like obligations. It's fun, with some great bits of physical comedy and a necessary return to the heartstring-plucking of the first film, though overall it lands in somewhat shallow waters. An improvement over the underachieving Despicable Me 2, if not quite up to the original's snuff.",Despicable Me 3
34,kirbylee70-599-526179,Brotherly Love,10,19 December 2017,"Has it really been 7 years since we were introduced to master criminal Gru and his merry band of misfit yellow henchmen the Minions? Apparently so. But that hasn't stopped them from invading the pop culture world and taking it be storm as well as leading to a spin off with the banana singing creatures as well as now two sequels the latest of which has just been released on DVD.Gru (Steve Carell) has been working for the AVL (Anti-Villainy League) with his now wife Lucy (Kristin Wiig) for a while now when the call goes out about a new bad guy on the loose. Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker) was once a popular child star appearing as a pre-teen criminal with world conquering aspirations. Then puberty hit and his career ended. Now he's decided to take on the persona of master criminal for real and seek revenge on Hollywood.With a penchant for 80s pop songs and a fierce mullet complete with spiked hair atop, Balthazar tries to steal the world's biggest jewel. Gru and Lucy foil him but with some embarrassment along the way, enough that they are fired from the AVL.Fortunately at the same time Gru learns that he had a twin brother, Dru, who wants to connect with him. Gru, Lucy and their girls Margo, Edith and Agnes, are whisked off to Freedonia where they find Dru runs a successful pig operation. Or so it seems. In truth he longs to be a master criminal like both he and Gru's father was.As Gru learns more about his past and his brother he concocts a plot to please both his brother and get his job back. The major theft he plans is that of the jewel Balthazar stole when it was successfully returned to its home. With the help of Dru he just might do it.But there are others involved in these stories right? The girls are paid less attention this time around and it is Lucy who deals more with them than Gru this time. Lucy is still trying to get the hang of this being a mother thing and it's not as easy a task as she thought but she's learning.And the Minions, what about them? When Gru gets fired they abandon him because he won't return to a life of crime. On their own they are eventually arrested and sent to prison but not before winning a singing competition.Eventually all the storylines come together and make for a satisfying movie that entertains and delights both children and adults. There are the usual slightly gross jokes for the snickering kids, some jokes placed that adults will get and kids won't and a lot of love between the characters which has actually been the trademark of the series. It's never been all about being evil or good but about caring for others that has made this movie series as successful as it is.The animation here is superb and has been from the start. While I'm still a huge fan of the old style Disney animation it's movies like this one that are winning me over. The visual gags that they pull off in the film would not be achieved in a reality based film and the computer animation lends itself to those sort of jokes. The old two dimensional style would have seemed more realistic and thus not worked as well.While the combination of story, animation and voice acting skills combine to make this a great movie those who are fans know that the DVD release means there will be extras worth looking at. There are two music videos to be found as well as a mini-movie THE SECRET LIFE OF KYLE. There is no such thing as too much Minions and this proves true here.DESPICABLE ME 3 is a movie worth renting but my own suggestion is buying and owning it. As a matter of fact pick them all up. I know in my case having done so I'll pop one in every now and then and get a laugh and my heart tugged and enjoy every minute of it. And since we're this close to Christmas this movie would make a fantastic stocking stuffer. Consider this one a must have.",Despicable Me 3

3. Time is too precious to waste on a lackluster cash grab.",Despicable Me 3
38,rgkarim,Three is A Win For Me,8,30 June 2017,"Despite what I had hoped, it seemed inevitable for Universal studios to bring about another Despicable Me movie to compete in this summer's animation flick. The series has been incredibly popular with merchandising, despite a film series with an up and down quality. Gru and company are back for another round to try and tickle our funny bones while melting our hearts in the process. Will time number four (three if you don't count the prequel) return back to the quality of the first predecessor, or does it fall victim to merchandising simplicity? Robbie K here to try and answer that question! Let's get started!LIKES:Animation/Cute: We all know that these movies are adorable, and that same atmosphere is present through much of the movie. The relationships between Gru and his Minions, and his newfound brother Dru, and even lovable little Agnes and her new family are certain to soften the hardest hearts. And to bring that cuteness to full form is the lovable, fluid, and crazy animation of this series. All the disproportioned anatomical parts, colorful settings, and vibrant gestures are flawless in this movie and bring that same atmosphere you fell in love with. Funny/Clever: Of course Despicable Me isn't just about being cute, but also comical at the same time. It seems the directing team learned something from their first movie, and did a nice job bringing entertainment to the silver screen. Despicable Me 3 dives back into its comedy roots, maximizing on awkwardly hilarious scenarios and over the top comedic delivery. Gru (and Dru) spout off plenty of one-liners that had me laughing, in those grossly accented, over the top accents that make me laugh. The writing is not only well-timed, but also quite clever in the number of references they make alongside the pokes at popular culture. Even the Minions redeem themselves, falling back into a supporting role that changes up the comedy styles and brings even more laughs. Such nice balance works and is a step in the right direction for future series, especially with the jokes integrated into a story instead of just jabbering nonsense.Music: If you have read my previous reviews, then you know I appreciate good sound support to the visuals. Certainly, the sound editing goes well with all the crazy visual effects, but the real masterpiece comes in the music. Balthazar Bratt is an 80's obsessed villain, see the trailer, and with this obsession comes a love for the 80's songs. Despicable Me 3 is not shy of the wonders of the decade, in all their toe tapping, synthesizer heavy glory. I was happy to know all the songs on the track list, and appreciated it even more at the clever integration into the movie. Sure, there are some stretches into the silly section, but for the most part my friend and I had a blast enjoying the teams' integration into the movie that was incredibly fun!DISLIKES:Smaller Character Development: It was cute, it was cuddly, and it had some strong moments of development. Yet Despicable Me 3 still cannot hold a candle to the majesty of the first film in regards to balance of the character development. Gru and Dru's story is well matched, and the main villain has a tightened-up story. Yet, the development of the other characters remains lacking at parts, forced at times into a rushed mess that felt shallow and lacking. Gru is doing well with his fatherhood, but the third installment somehow washes the caring father role away in favor of the newer relationships, such a shame. In addition, I didn't feel the emotional kick like I did back in the first installments as well. There was one point I felt sorry for a side character, but outside of thatnothing. No Dr. Nefario: It's unfortunate, but true. Fans of the notorious, invention making, gas filled madmen are going to be disappointed with the lack of his deep voice and obscure lines. Sure, there is a cameo (that is quite entertaining), but the absence of the side kick was a disappointment to this reviewer and the hilarity that could have ensued. Oh well, perhaps the next one will bring him back into the mix, but don't get your heart set on anything. Trailers reveals much: Why can Hollywood not learn to sell everything in the trailers? Despicable me 3 falls victim to much being revealed in the 3-4 TV spots that have been released. Pay attention to these trailers and you will be able to decipher the intentions, schemes, and outcomes of much of the movie leaving little to the imagination. And yes, there are many comedy moments that have been overdone on the trailers, which may chip away some of the effect. Shame on you advertising for revealing so much surprise. Fortunately, if you are free of TV ads (thanks to streaming), you are okay. The VERDICT:Despicable Me 3 was a fun, family friendly adventure that I very much enjoyed. With a fantastic sense of comedy, revamping of storytelling, and animation to support it all, I certainly think this entertainment worth watching. Yes, it still has its shortcomings in regards to emotional punches, character development, and surprise, but this reviewer feels the positivity contained in the 90 minutes will make up for it. Worth a trip to the theater? You bet it is, but no so much in 3-D as it did little but to add the coming at you from the screen gimmick.

39,invisibleunicornninja,This movie exists only to sell toys.,2,28 March 2018,"Logic - If you like watching movies with consistent logic, or movies that have established rules that they follow or movies that are at least coherent, then skip this movie. This is just a load of nonsense. Yes, there is a plot, but a lot of it makes very little sense. Your disbelief is going to be so suspended, it might break. Plot - See above point. Also, there are a ridiculous number of side plots in this movie. All of them manage to be stupid and unfunny and boring. Characters - The characters in this movie are even more boring and simplistic than ever. They're also even more inconsistent. They keep ignoring everything that has already been established. I feel really bad for the voice actors. I cannot believe that Trey Parker is in this movie. I have no clue how he agreed to be in this nonsense. Animation - The animation keeps getting worse over time. It is so incredibly lazy.This movie is not funny. It is not entertaining. There is no joy to be found here. This is a terrible movie. I really hope they don't make another one. The only good thing about this movie is that its pretty short. The only reason I saw this in theaters was because my mom made me see it with my dumb brother. That theater was pretty full and guess what? NOONE LAUGHED.",Despicable Me 3
40,justin-fencsak,Time for the series to die....,6,26 February 2018,"When the first Despicable Me came out in the summer of 2010, it became a surprise hit for Universal, who acquired the animation studio that that made it, Illumination, and turned into a franchise cash cow for the studio, whose last animation hits were from Don Bluth in the 80s as well as in the 90s from Amblimation. By the time the sequel came out, it was at its peak, and Minions shocked everyone by becoming the biggest cartoon of 2015. Since then, Illumination has made cartoons ranging from easter bunnies to singing animals, to talking pets, and later this year, a CGI take on The Grinch and soon, Super Mario. This third entry in the franchise, however, is a letdown from the last two. Despite having a killer 80s soundtrack mixed in with modern music from Pharrell WIlliams, this movie feels a bit too short and a bit rushed.",Despicable Me 3

42,bkrauser-81-311064,Feels More Like a Sitcom Than a Movie,7,9 July 2017,"As far as disposable sequels to kids films, Despicable Me 3 is pretty much on par with Cars 3 (2017). It's not a particularly memorable film nor can it really hold its own against something like The LEGO Batman Movie (2017) but at least it's not unpleasant. In-fact in may ways Despicable Me 3 is better than the original in that it improves its look-and-feel and provides a decent foil for once in the form of Trey Parker's Balthazar Bratt. Of course it's to the detriment of neutering the refreshing mean-spirited-ness of the original, but hey, at least you still got those Minions am I right? Despicable Me 3 catches Gru (Carell) and newly minted wife Lucy (Wiig) trying and failing to secure the world's largest diamond from the hands of Bratt our flamboyant 80's themed villain. Fired by the new head of the Anti-Villain League (Slate), Gru and Lucy discover he has a twin brother named Dru (also Carell) whom their parents separated at birth. With nothing on their plate, Gru, Lucy and the girls (Cosgrove, Gaier and Scharrel), travel to the Mediterranean coasts of Freedonia to meet Dru.When the family lands in Freedonia, the movie descends into a series of fun but thematically incongruous vignettes. Gru bonds with his brother over Dru's desire to become a villain, Lucy fails, succeeds and fails again to become a mother figure to the three girls, Agnes, the youngest of the three tries to capture a unicorn, Balthazar Bratt sees his plans for world domination come to near-fruition and the Minions...well let's just say they have their own thing going as well.About half of all this busy, busy, business works at least as far as furthering the plot. The fact that none of the film's insanity really coalesces into a compelling whole, only makes the film feel more like a mediocre sitcom episode than an actual movie. Yet as far as inspired moments of slapstick, Despicable Me 3 supplies a little bit more than is to be expected. One highlight involves Gru and Dru driving around the Freedonian countryside in a golden-plated mean machine while police follow while riding literal pigs. Parents will find these comedic bits more amusing than funny but the kids, the kids will be rolling up and down the aisles.And isn't that what this movie is ultimately about? To provide entertainment to children? While I don't necessarily condone families watching kid's films for their own sake (and this one in particular is all over the map as far as messaging), there's not really all that much to object about here. Despicable Me 3 is at its core a thoughtless but entertaining jumble of sights, sounds and goofiness. Thankfully unlike your racist aunt, Illumination Entertainment has not used the Minions for nefarious purposes...at least not yet.",Despicable Me 3
43,moviexclusive,"Nowhere near as clever, funny or sweet as its predecessors, this threequel is a disjointed jumble of some amusing, some tedious and mostly under-developed parts",5,15 June 2017,"As the 'Minions' movie demonstrated, too much of the adorable, pill- shaped, banana-obsessed creatures isn't necessarily a good thing; indeed, they were probably best in smaller and supporting doses, playing bumbling sidekicks alongside Gru as he went about his villainous, then anti-villainous, ways in 'Despicable Me' and 'Despicable Me 2' respectively. Unfortunately, they aren't given much, if anything, to do in this threequel, who as it turns out, are fed up of working for a good guy and decide to part ways with Gru early in the movie. That means they are here no better than occasional irreverent comic distractions, much like how Scrat was in the 'Ice Age' movies, notwithstanding a laugh-out-loud jailbreak sequence set to Pharrell Williams's hit 'Freedom'.And unfortunately, that sums up how 'Despicable Me 3' feels as well – always distracted, sometimes amusing, but never really engaging. It wants to be about the rivalry between Gru (Steve Carell) and all-new supervillain Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker), the latter a disgruntled former 80s child TV star who had fallen out of favour with the general public after hitting puberty and has since turned to a life of crime. It wants to be about Gru's new fellow super-agent wife Lucy (Kristen Wiig), who is trying to be a mother to his three adopted daughters – Margo, Edith and Agnes. It wants to be about Gru reconciling with his long-lost twin brother Dru, an empty-headed but successful pig farmer who yearns to follow in their father's footsteps of being a super-villain. Amidst all this, it also wants to be about Agnes and her longing to find a unicorn.No wonder then that the sweetness between Gru and his daughters from the earlier two movies is somewhat lost here. No wonder too that the Looney Tunes-esque gags seem to unfold at an almost breakneck pace, sacrificing wit and inventiveness for sheer visual spectacle. No wonder that it all feels drawn-out and overstuffed, cramming too many plot lines without ever developing any satisfactorily – except perhaps for the complicated sibling relationship between Gru and Dru, seeing as how the former tricks the latter into helping him break into Bratt's Rubik's Cube-like fortress perched at the tip of a pyramid. It is understandable how returning writers Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul had felt the need to up the ante with each subsequent instalment of the franchise, but like the 'Minions' spin off, less is sometimes a lot, a lot more.There are good bits though: Bratt, complete with shoulder pads, pump sneakers and 80s pop tunes of Michael Jackson, Van Halen, a-Ha and Madonna among others, is a hoot; so too the barrage of other 80s references, including Bratt's army of weaponised figurines christened 'Bratt Pack'. Carell and Wiig lose none of their verve reprising Gru/ Dru and Lucy, and Parker is a lively, dynamic addition to the ensemble voice cast – in particular as a substitute to Russell Brand, whose Dr. Nefario spends the movie frozen in carbonite. Co-directors Pierre Coffin and Kyle Balda try their best-est to keep up the energy and enthusiasm from start to finish, and largely succeed in spite of a somewhat tedious detour on Dru's fictional European island in the middle act.Yet even on the same level of fun as its predecessors, 'Despicable Me 3' falls way short. We wish it were simply that what was once fresh has now become familiar; but oh no, the gags are nowhere near as funny nor as clever, and even the minions are starting to lose their subversive edge. Whether that is the cause or consequence of having too many things going on at the same time is anybody's guess, but the sum of some hilarious bits, some tedious ones and a lot of underdeveloped elements in between is a sporadically amusing affair that hardly lives up to the charm of the previous two chapters. When even kids below the age of five find their patience tested, it's as sure a sign as any that this franchise is fast turning yellow.",Despicable Me 3
44,valadas,Not so good,6,12 July 2017,"My opinion is that animated, puppet or cartoon movies, if they are good, can be seen with pleasure both by children and grown-ups. This is not the case with this movie. Despite the fact that is is technically good chiefly in terms of animation and visual effects though not better than the majority of its kind, it is rather weak in terms of the story and sequences. Well I must say that I have not seen the first two movies and that's maybe why I didn't quite understand what the story was about and who are exactly those characters. But the story develops itself in a series of violent actions and events (is this good to be seen by children?)such as collisions, clashes, aggressions and people yelling all the time which have only purely visual effects in terms of contents. Summing it up it's worth very little.",Despicable Me 3

46,Abdulxoxo,Not bad,7,11 February 2021,"The main plot isn't bad, and the minions stuff feels limited but relatively funny. Although they had some sweet moments I think they should have cut down on the storylines of the daughters. They didn't add much to the film and it would have allowed for more time to be dedicated to the main plot and also the minions. I think the Gru & Dru story was an interesting idea only for a limited time. The scenes of the minions in jail were good, although I wish there were more. The wife, Lucy, and eldest daughter Margo had an interesting relationship; but it was very much a side story. The highlights however is the villain, Balthazar Bratt. Bratt used to be on a successful 80's TV show when he was a child, but when he hit puberty his career came to an end. He couldn't let the character go however and grew up to be the character he used to portray on TV. I loved this character. He still dressed like he was in the 80's and his catchphrase ""I've been a baaaad boy"" was creepy, He also lived his life to a fantastic 80's soundtrack, It's one of the funniest characters in the movie.
Overall, there's a bit too much going on. It's an ok watch, but nothing more. That said, for the parts with the minions and the brilliant villain, it's arguably what makes this movie worthwhile.",Despicable Me 3
47,MR_Heraclius,I really enjoyed it,7,21 February 2020,"Despicable Me 3 is my personal 2nd favorite in the series. There are parts of what made the first so amazing and each part shot into one of the sequels and I think Despicable Me 3 did its part better. The movie has only two major weaknesses that are easy to get past being that there is too many plots and that it relies on juvenile humor and toilet humor more than the last two. However, these are just small flaws and are easy to look past once you see the plots mesh together in a really satisfying way. This movie had some pretty good highlights, like when Gru said his mother told him that his father died of disappointment when he was born as well. Overall, Despicable Me 3 is an extremely enjoyable ride I'd recommend to anyone who can get past its flaws.",Despicable Me 3

He does a good job with what he's given, but you wonder WHY he took up the part in the first place!? Was there any real motivation for him doing this besides the money? I think not.What can I say?

Teaming up they attempt to get revenge on Balthazar, while Lucy and the girls have their own adventures. The minions end up in jail and have their own issues to deal with. Another fun film with all the voices you've come to know across the trilogy. It's got the same beauty as the first two films and manages to further the characters development. The plot is a little weak compared to the first films. For me it feels like the concept is getting a little tired now, it's a decent watch, but I didn't laugh as much, nor did I care as much as in the first two films. I was more amused at Balthazar Bratt and the 80's references than the main story, but that's because I'm a product of the 80's myself. Having done 3 movies now, 4 if you count the stand alone Minions film, I get the impression that the series is coming to an end.

54,phubbs,Despicable Me 3,4,27 October 2017,"Just when you thought they couldn't milk this franchise any further, we get a trilogy, as if it was obligatory (I actually think it is).I have never understood why this franchise was even remotely popular. The first movie was reasonably passable capitalising on the now exhausted superhero genre. An evil super genius getting long in the tooth tries to remain relevant amongst the growing number of younger supervillains. And in the end the supervillain becomes the hero. Then came the sequel which simply went straight down the old supervillain versus superhero route. The supervillain from the first movie now essentially a superhero fighting crime. Now along comes the third movie which is clearly struggling for ideas.It now turns out that old Gru (Steve Carell) has a long lost brother called Dru (ugh!!). Dru of course looks identical to Gru except he has hair, he is also voiced by Carell. Dru is a budding supervillain and dreams of working with his infamous super genius brother. Problem is Gru is now a superhero and can't find a way to break this to his brother. So in the long run Gru ends up tricking Dru into helping him take down a problematic supervillain called Balthazar Brat (Trey Parker). Gru does this by pretending they are actually carrying out an evil plan. But anyway, yes they drag up the old long lost relation plot angle to keep this nonsense going. I really don't need to explain how lame this is do I?Right so we already know Gru, his wife Lucy and their kids. So what about Dru, what's he like? Well like I said he looks identical to Gru, except for his flowing blonde hair. His voice is fairly similar to Gru's because he's voiced by Carell, oh and he dresses in white...to counter Gru's black. So yeah...that's about as imaginative as it gets for that. But wait! There is actually a positive note here, and that's the new evil character of Balthazar Brat. This is mainly down to two simple reasons. Firstly he's voiced by Trey Parker who has that simple, yet amusing tone of voice that we all know and love from 'South Park'. Really hard to pinpoint why his voice is so catchy because its generally pretty normal. I think its Parker's ability to sound so satirical and mocking in a relatively deadpan manner.Secondly its because the character of Balthazar is stuck in the 80's. He's obsessed with the 80's, anything and everything to do with that era. Being an 80's gen bloke this of course appealed to me greatly and I enjoyed the various pop culture references. Admittedly most of the references, quips and visual gags weren't anything overly original. He dances to various classic 80's pop songs while he works and plays with various 80's toys and gadgets. He dresses in typical 80's fashions, he has a mullet, and his evil plan involves a giant robot or mech rampaging through Hollywood (in typical 'Godzilla' or 80's Saturday morning cartoon type fashion). So whilst this character was indeed a totally unoriginal idea, for me he was fun to watch. Not overly sure how kids these days would quite get him though. I would of thought most of the references would go sailing over their heads.Indeed its only when Balthazar is on the screen this movie is any fun. Most of the movie is filled with mind-numbing crapola showing Gru looking after his insufferable kids. Like the sub plot involving one of his daughters trying to find a unicorn...eh? Or the other daughter and her potential boyfriend...ugh! Or spending time with his brother and his supervillain inventions (like we haven't seen that kind of stuff before). As for the minions, hell they've been relegated to a sub plot also. You don't actually get that much minion screen time a tall really because they leave Gru after he refuses to return to villainy. Of course they return for the finale but overall they're in and out of the picture. Odd because I thought they were a cash cow.I dunno, I just didn't get the point of this movie because it literally offered nothing new. Even the bad guy, who was enjoyable, was completely unoriginal in every aspect. Yes the movie looks great as all CGI animated movies do nowadays, so that's kinda inconsequential at the end of the day. The soundtrack is the usual god awful collection of hip-hop and rap which every kids movie has to incorporate it seems. Its not particularly funny and its not particularly exciting. The entire feature simply feels like a by the numbers production merely chugged out to try and squeeze the last few drops of money out before it inevitably dies.

57,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A franchise on the verge of trying to do too much.,6,8 March 2019,"Sometimes I wonder how this franchise became so popular. Perhaps this perception is due to the oversaturation of the annoying little ""Minions"" that seem to pervade every corner of social media. And yet, when I go to see a movie like this, I am soon reminded that there are relatable and underappreciated storylines and plot points contained within this silliness. I have rarely seen a better ""adoption"" storyline than the one presented in Despicable Me (2010). Of course, Despicable Me 2 (2013) took the natural next step and provided a ""single dad looking for a wife"" storyline that also is rarely seen in animation.With Despicable Me 3 (2017), the franchise transitions more into a series of vignettes better suited for a television show than a feature-length film. It was a little hard to tell which storyline was the main one for the film, even if they were all intertwined in some way. From the ""long lost brother"" character arc to the ""wife trying to gain acceptance of step-children"" sub-plot, there almost wasn't enough time to focus on the Minions' mutiny or the campy 1980's-inspired villain. Each of the segments almost felt episodic, as if they would work better as a 15-minute segment in a 30-minute children's show.All this being said, there were moments I did enjoy in this movie. From the occasional ""adult-oriented"" Minion jokes (like ""The Major General's Song"" and a Die Hard (1988) quote) to the touching moments of true parenting (again, a rare treat), the most entertaining aspect of the film was the nostalgia-inducing antics of Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker). However, because I mostly know Tray Parker from his work on ""South Park,"" I couldn't separate his voice from the numerous episodes of this raunchy and politically incorrect television show (which is probably, again, something for the adults in the audience).A franchise on the verge of trying to do too much, I give Despicable Me 3 3.0 stars out of 5.",Despicable Me 3
58,juliankennedy23,Prisoner of Love,6,8 April 2018,"Despicable Me 3: Despicable Me 3 continues the adventures of (now former) supervillain Gru (Steve Carell) who with his wife (Kristen Wiig) and his army of Minions while they fight crime. They are doing battle against former eighties child star and supervillain Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker) who is trying to steal a giant pink diamond in France.The Good: I like the Minions. I have Minion characters on my checks from Costco and my address return labels. I have a couple of large minion dolls that guard the dryer in the laundry room. I am not a middle-aged woman who drinks too much red wine, however, for me the Minions spark joy. When the minions are on the screen their antics are the funniest thing around (The jail bit in this film is downright inspired and almost saves the whole movie.)Also a special kudos for the cutest ""unicorn"" I have ever seen on film (Take note The Last Unicorn). In fact, the entire film is cute, colorful and very kid friendly. (The main bad guy's superweapon is expanding bubblegum.)The Bad: Let's start with a quote from the first Despicable Me...
(Sees Edith near his iron maiden)
Gru: No, no! Stay away from there! It's fragile!
(the iron maiden closes with Edith inside; a red liquid leaks from underneath; Margo and Agnes gasp)
Gru: Well, I suppose the plan will work with two.I missed this Gru in Despicable Me 2 and he is long gone in Despicable Me 3. Gru simply works better as a despicable villain with an occasional soft spot rather than a big softy who only does villain stuff because that is what is on his CV and the mortgage is due.There are also too many subplots in the film. The Minions are spun off for most of the flick, so their scenes cannot do double duty for the rest of the plot. Obvious jokes that the writers initially would have had (The villain is stealing the Pink Panther after all) were clearly cut for time. It leads to a choppy, meanwhile in another movie, vibe.In conclusion: This is the weakest of the Despicable Me films (Yes weaker than even The Minions movie). It also made over one billion dollars. This is not even including the ridiculous monies the merchandising made. Needless to say, we should look forward to many more efforts down the line.",Despicable Me 3
59,fernandoschiavi,"This 3rd part presents more of the same, not offending the intelligence of the child and adult audiences, certainly, but without aiming at the evolution of the franchise",6,25 May 2021,"Despicable Me is one of those franchises that need a single specific element to support themselves, in this case, this aspect is ""cuteness"" - the big problem is that, if we take this away, there is absolutely nothing left. Beginning with a film that only entertains (being optimistic), the series soon broke down with its just regular continuation, in addition to the unnecessary and boring Minions spin-off. Despite this, the need for money speaks louder than creativity and soon ""we win"" Despicable Me 3, a work that can even amuse very young children, but that for any other minimally demanding when it comes to cinema proves to be a real torture.The film begins by introducing us to its main antagonist, Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker), a former star of a children's television series that has fallen by the wayside. Outraged by his current irrelevant position, he adopts the villainous persona that he played on the small screens and decides to steal a gigantic diamond using unexpected techniques involving giant gum. Enter Gru (Steve Carell) and his wife, Lucy (Kristen Wiig), who now work for an anti-villain agency. Rescuing the diamond, but failing to capture Bratt, who promises that this will not be the last time they meet, the two are expelled from the agency and, shortly thereafter, are contacted by Gru's lost twin brother, Dru. Both then begin a journey to connect while Balthazar continues his grand plan.The premise of Despicable Me 3 is already extremely forced, we are introduced to two characters (the antagonist and the twin brother) who have never even been mentioned before, with the text offering lousy excuses to justify this fact. Here, Gru discovers that he has an unknown twin brother, Dru, who, like him in the past, dreams of being the number one of backbiting and wants fraternal help to do so. Will Gru undo his benevolent saga in favor of his ""new"" family?! If you liked the premise and for some time you believed that this great dilemma will be developed here, forget it. After all, there is a big and continuous problem in the trilogy: The lack of coherence.In this third film, this becomes even more evident and unsatisfactory, when the protagonist seems to be totally aimless ... kind of drifting in his own person. He is a villain who is not a villain. A spy who is not a real spy. A father who is not even called a father. However, unfortunately, this characteristic is not a peculiarity found only in the main character. The script of the feature seeks to find a private story for each of the protagonists: if Gru finds himself facing a twin brother totally different from him, his beloved Lucy now needs to face the role of mother of the girls, who in turn, face the challenge of finding a real unicorn and getting rid of a little boy in love. Even the Minions have their demand, and it is ""indigestible"" correlated with the saga shown in the solo film of the yellow ones. However, all of these issues are addressed in the most inconsistent ways - again! - and shallow as possible, and are resolved with the speed and ease of a wink. They all sound completely disconnected from the general context, functioning as extra elements that only expand the narrative, making it more tiring than it already is. The result is a ninety-minute film that makes us feel like we've been sitting in the theater for four hours - that's right in the middle of the projection.The main plot, on the other hand, follows in the most predictable way possible, delivering no surprise to the viewer. The support for ""cuteness"", the main element of the franchise, is evident, from Gru's youngest daughter, to Dru's cheerful personality. The work, however, makes such an effort to sound funny that, in the end, it almost fails to elicit any laughter. The greatest example of this fruitless attempt to create an engaging comedy is the antagonist, Bratt, who basically only dances the entire film to the sound of 80s melodies. With a look and style that fuses all the possible and imaginable stereotypes of the exaggerated eighties, at least he has more charm and irreverence than the rest of the film combined. His mission, although silly - as the missions of any cartoon villain should be - is simple and objective: take revenge on those who canceled their successful 80s show on TV. And he, as he likes to stress all the time, is bad!Despicable Me 3, this does not differ much from the excellence residing in the other 2 films: it has high points, which will soon be exposed; and low points, these that approach those of the second plus some details in the script that will soon be exposed as well. Focusing, for now, on the positives, it is a fact that this franchise has very charismatic characters due to its caricature tones. Dru as a caricature of a character in Gothic horror literature; the girls resuming very strong caricatures and stereotypes of childhood and pre-adolescence - but, it is a fact, in the first films these ""stereotypes"" ended up reproducing an extremely old-fashioned ""beautiful and demure"" girl who, although she was reduced from the first to the third film, it still leaves traces in the script; and now we have Dru, Gru's twin brother, who is a caricature of the millionaire and muscular playboy; besides Balthazar Bratt, who is a tribute to the pop culture of the eighties.What is interesting to note is the fact that this film is mainly themed on personal frustration - conditioned by professional frustration to a certain extent, which is very ideological if we stop to think ... - and the way in which the character's deal with it. Bratt has a grudge against the industry and this motivates him to be a villain, Dru and Gru have their family frustrations focused on the pride their parents have for them (or, remember, Gru's childhood was abusively marked by bullying), Lucy searches for acceptance of your daughters.... However, it is clear that to these frustrations the film will deal with a mushy and overly romantic construction and characterization. It is a fact that perhaps he lost a lot of power of commotion by choosing these foolish brutality and easy fall into common places to develop the drama of the characters.Some issues in the script can hurt you even more. The villain Bratt ends up being developed with a certain laziness: the establishment of his personality does not occur through the unfolding of the plot so that it was established with greater subjectivity and commotion. Despicable Me 3 ends up establishing it mechanically and coldly didactic, through merely explanatory lines that do not show any sensitivity in the audience. But it is interesting to also reflect on this view of ""criminality"" almost as a ""professional choice"", as if certain people have chosen evil as a career vocation. It is not known whether the film satirizes this lunatic and almost pathological figure of the criminal - as if he were the embodiment of evil and did it for the pleasure of doing evil - or if he satirizes it as a caricature. It is, however, an idea that if taken seriously would make it difficult to understand certain ""social phenomena"", in addition to being somewhat outdated.Despite too much frantic editing and action, the animation is visually well done and some tricks, such as the ""yin yang"" game of the brothers' clothes, end up proving to be quite interesting. The soundtrack of the Brazilian Heitor Pereira (""Angry Birds: The Movie"") follows the line of the previous features and is agitated and fun, as well as the original dancing songs composed by the musician Pharrell Williams. The animation itself fulfills its role, but does not bring anything new. Of course we are talking about a franchise and it is necessary to respect the visual identity created in the first film, but, apart from subtle differences, it seems that we are seeing the same work from 2010. It does not help, of course, the fact that the script follows practically the same formula of the previous two, with Gru fighting another villain. The lack of originality is even surreal, destroying any possible intention of the directors to bring something different to the series. The spectator's tiredness, of course, only increases with the action sequences without any emotion, being reduced to car races or characters climbing some surface.Despicable Me 3, therefore, brings more of the same, the big problem is that, by repeating the same formula three times. It is a feature that will please children in full because of its characteristic and frequent - nowadays - frantic rhythm. However, a well-written script and an efficient character development, as we have seen before in the unforgettable ""Ratatouille"" and ""Inside Out"" or at least close to the ""cutie"" that is the first film in the trilogy, would do very well for adults who, after all, they need to take children to the cinema. This third part of the cine series is content to present more of the same, not offending the intelligence of the child and adult audiences, certainly, but without aiming at the evolution of the franchise. The inclusion of new figures in the troubled life of the now ex-villain (husband and father of three daughters) Gru is done schematically. It is good escapist entertainment, similar in so many points to the previous two, but defeated by the lack of focus.",Despicable Me 3
60,Anurag-Shetty,"Lives up to the second but, the first one is still the best.",8,6 July 2017,"Despicable Me 3 continues with the adventures of Gru(Steve Carell), Lucy(Kristen Wiig), Margo(Miranda Cosgrove), Edith(Dana Gaier), Agnes(Nev Scharrel) & the Minions(Pierre Coffin). Gru meets his twin brother, Dru(Steve Carell). Dru requests Gru to return to his criminal roots & join forces with him, for one final heist. However, Gru must also deal with the super villain, Balthazar Bratt(Trey Parker). Despicable Me 3 is a great movie. It is as entertaining as Despicable Me 2(2013) & far better than Minions(2015). However, Despicable Me(2010) is still the best film in the Despicable Me franchise. Directors Kyle Balda & Pierre Coffin perfectly balance the heart, humor & over-the-top action set pieces, that have made these movies so popular. The animation is gorgeous. The 3D in this film, does not quite live up to the 3D effects of its predecessors, or any other animated movie. The vocal performances of the talented cast, are the highlight of the film. Steve Carell is mind blowing as the voice of Gru/Dru. Carell changes his voice in a skilled yet subtle manner, to also play Gru's fun-loving twin brother, Dru. Kristen Wiig is brilliant as Lucy. Trey Parker is awesome as Balthazar Bratt. Miranda Cosgrove is amazing as Margo. Dana Gaier is fantastic as Edith. Nev Scharrel is extremely adorable as Agnes. Witnessing Agnes & all her adventures this time around, will melt your heart, like always. Pierre Coffin is hysterical as the Minions. Steve Coogan is good as Fritz/Silas Ramsbottom. Julie Andrews is spectacular as Gru's Mom. Jenny Slate, Andy Nyman & Adrian Ciscato are impressive as Valerie Da Vinci, Clive the Robot & Niko, respectively. Despicable Me 3 is a must watch for Despicable Me & Steve Carell fans. Great fun for the whole family!",Despicable Me 3
61,Animany94,Too unfocused to make it another hit.,6,13 February 2019,"The first two Despicable Me films are really funny, sweet and full of surprises and deliver lots of enjoyment for the whole family. The third installment has noticable problems with its focus and only delivers in a scatter-shot fashion.That's what drags it down, because the ideas they put into it were hilarious. Balthazar Bratt made me excited to see Gru take up the challenge of his life when the scene is set in the beginning of the movie.But that sadly ends when his brother entered the picture, because from their on it really started to feel like the writers tried biting off more than they could chew. More and more subplots were added as the movie progressed and the focus was all over the place.I still got some laughs out of what happened, but they were few and far between. Despite a promising start it failed to deliver the same amount of laughs and heart as the first two movies.",Despicable Me 3
62,swilliky,Still funny and cute but becoming repetitive,7,5 July 2017,"The villains and his Minions return for another adventure. Gru (Steve Carell) has adapted to a life as a secret agent working with his wife Lucy (Kristen Wiig) for the Anti Villain League. When a new villain Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker), a former child star obsessed with the 80s when he was famous, steals a diamond, Gru steps in and prevents him from stealing the diamond but lets him escape. The new leader of the AVL Valerie Da Vinci (Jenny Slate) fires Gru and Lucy for failing to capture Bratt. Without a job, Gru worries about his new family but the Minions want him to go back to villainy. The Minions abandon Gru and set out on their own. Gru has to break the news to his adopted daughters Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier), and Agnes (Nev Scharrel) and does so with the help of Lucy who is struggling to adapt to the role of mother. Balthazar uses a fat suit that looks like our current president to steal the diamond. Gru receives a request from his long lost twin brother Dru. The family flies out the Freedonia to meet Dru who lives on a pig farm. Dru sends Lucy and the girls into the village and proposes to Gru a return to villainy. Lucy tries to adjust to being a mother but loses Agnes and Edith. Agnes learns of a legend of a unicorn and becomes determined to find the mystical creature.

64,ofpsmith,It's not terrible by any means but the series is starting to fade.,6,12 July 2017,"It's a common curse with the third movie in most trilogies (assuming we don't count Minions.) The third movie is usually where it starts to wear off. Such is the case for Despicable Me 3. The movie is average. That's it. It's not great, it's not bad, it's just average. The story is that Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker), former 80s child actor turned super villain has eluded capture from Gru (Steve Carell) and Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig) for too long, and the new chief of the Anti Villain League isn't happy about it and fires them. Eager to get their jobs back Gru receives word that he has a long lost twin brother named Dru (Carell also) who invites him to his home in a country known as Freedonia (the same country that Groucho Marx ran in Duck Soup). Dru attempts to get Gru back into villainy. Gru manages to resist the urge for a whole 5 minutes. The master plan is to now steal a diamond from Bratt and hopefully be readmitted to the Anti Villain League. Along the way we have numerous sub plots involving Lucy trying to be a good mom, the Minions fed up with lack of crime and going to jail (it's never specified how that happens), Agnes (Nev Scharrel) wanting to find a unicorn after hearing a legend, Bratt wanting to destroy Hollywood in revenge for rejecting him as a teenager, and the relationship between Gru and Dru. In all honesty I think there's more plots than The Dark Knight Rises. This is really the biggest problem. A Despicable Me movie really doesn't need this many plot threads. Most of the time the movie just jumps around to each one and it comes off as being unfocused. Kids will probable be fine with it and it is enjoyable enough, but I don't think it's as good as the other three.",Despicable Me 3
65,kjproulx,The Downfall Of A Franchise,4,10 January 2018,"It had taken me a while to finally view this third installment in the Despicable Me franchise because Minions more than gave me fatigue. I loved the original film and even enjoyed the second one quite a bit, but Minions was honestly the worst possible thing they could've done for this franchise. Sadly, I had lost all hope until I found myself chuckling throughout the trailers for Despicable Me 3, but I've never been more wrong. Although these movies continue to make loads of cash, the quality seems to progressively get worse. The uniqueness of this franchise has officially been thrown out the window. Yes, these movies will continue getting made due to money, but if this installment is any indication, quality is clearly not what matters to them anymore.Following Gru after he has proven himself to be a great father and a great man in general, he and his new lover work for an organization that brings down villains. As a new villain is on the horizon in Balthazar Bratt, Gru must do everything in his power to take him down. Adding in a layer of family, he also discovers that he has a brother who shares his original need to be a villain. Combining all of these story elements pretty much sends this film into an endless repetition, providing the same character arcs that the first two films already offered. This film is a jumbled mess in terms of doing anything new with its characters and when it comes down to it, it's just not all that funny either.The clever slapstick humor of the first two films is truly what made them so enjoyable and while this movie definitely attempts to recapture that magic, the slapstick just comes off as forced and the childish humor is cranked up to a thousand. I found this movie to be much more for children than the previous films were. The meshing of adult humor worked very well and could play well for a much broader audience. There are a few laugh-out-loud moments here, but they're too few and far between. Sadly though, aside from a few solid jokes, the only great thing about this film is the animation.Many animated films can be called great in terms of how they look, but that's not enough to warrant praise as a whole. Despicable Me 3 is beautifully animated as always and the journey the film takes you on is fun enough to experience once, but I'm finding myself remembering everything that happened throughout this film with ease because it was so incredibly predictable. I have no desire to ever revisit this installment. Quite frankly, I can't even begin to describe my disappointment with this film in comparison with its predecessors.In conclusion, this movie may be a fine watch for young kids, but I won't ever find myself recommending this film to anyone over the age of ten, because the humor is just too juvenile, unlike the jokes that made the first two so memorable. It's not like this is one of the worst animated movies I've ever seen, but when I find myself laughing at one or two jokes throughout a 90-minute film, in which its predecessors had me chuckling consistently, then there's a big issue.Despicable Me 3 has great voice talents as always, but none of them are utilized to their full potential this time around, especially with the addition of the very funny Trey Parker. I thought his character was going to be far more enjoyable than just another average villain, but his tropes got tired pretty quick. Overall, this movie fails to provide anything new for the franchise and therefore sort of kills any future excitement I would've wished to have for the coming films. Maybe Minions 2 will turn that around? I doubt it...",Despicable Me 3
66,Carycomic,"A nice, family-friendly ending to a half-way decent trilogy.",9,1 July 2017,"Once again, Steve Carell proves he's better at doing CGI voice-overs than he is at live-action comedy.The movie begins with a retrospective news story about Balthazar Bratt; an ex-child TV star gone bad (Holy Danny Partridge, Batman!). Followed by the super-villainous, middle-aged version going after the world's biggest diamond in the modern day. When Gru and Lucy fail to capture him, however, it turns out that this is the _third_ such disastrous confrontation.Result; termination of employment with extreme (though non-lethal) prejudice.The rest of the film is like a cross between Disney's THE INCREDIBLES and the Ah-nuld/Devito comedy TWINS. Carell does an admittedly good job making Drew appear to be a more naive/less competent version of Old Gru (the villainous one from the first film) simply by using a shriller voice combined with wavy-blond CGI hair! So, who better to help him overcome that handicap than his long-lost brother who once stole the Moon, itself?Speaking of shrill voices; once again, the Minions are voiced--at higher RPM's--by French executive producer Pierre Coffin. Although, the sub-plot about their going to prison for loitering and trespassing wasn't as hilarious as it could have been, I still got a kick out of the French version of that old Gilbert and Sullivan classic, ""The Modern Major General.""I also loved Julie Andrews' cameo ""appearance"" as the voice of Gru's mother (now a cougar-ish dowager). Priceless!But, of course, what really stole the show (as in the first two films) was the lovability of Little Agnes. This time, on the hunt for a ""really live unicorn.""Add all of the above--plus some STAR WARS and Marx Brothers references-- to a toe-tapping, finger-snapping, head-bobbing sound track from the Eighties (back when MTV actually lived up to the name ""Music Television"") and you've got another winner from Sony/Illumination.",Despicable Me 3

68,brankovranjkovic,Despicable Me3 - This series has probably run it's course,6,1 July 2017,"Animated comedy third installment. I really wanted to enjoy this so went in with high expectations.

Gru finds out he has a very wealthy twin brother (Dru) who wants Gru to return to his evil ways. Together they recover the diamond and defeat the villain. As you might expect the Minions provide all the funniest scenes, I laughed whenever the minions were on screen. Essentially there aren't enough minions sketches. The 3 daughters were as sweet as ever and provide plenty of ahh moments. There's also a great 80's soundtrack. The first film was genius. The second film was great. This third film was OK but not great. A fourth installment would be just despicable.",Despicable Me 3

Despicable Me 3 is my personal 2nd favorite in the series. There are parts of what made the first so amazing and each part shot into one of the sequels and I think Despicable Me 3 did its part better. The movie has only two major weaknesses that are easy to get past being that there is too many plots and that it relies on juvenile humor and toilet humor more than the last two. However, these are just small flaws and are easy to look past once you see the plots mesh together in a really satisfying way. This movie had some pretty good highlights, like when Gru said his mother told him that his father died of disappointment when he was born as well. Overall, Despicable Me 3 is an extremely enjoyable ride I'd recommend to anyone who can get past its flaws.",Despicable Me 3
70,Alexander_Blanchett,Milk that cow,6,16 July 2017,"It was a fine sequel. Those films were never masterpieces but are easy fun and this is no difference. Tho it was more of a money milker than the previous ones as it was even more shallow than the other ones. Also I felt the story had more than one hole. However, it still and some funny and original moments and I laughed more than once but still I don't feel the need for any further sequels. The thing is all those films work with one formula, the bad guy is always the same kind of exaggerated psycho without any reasonable motives. The kids do everything to be incredibly cute (and they are, especially Agnes). Cru is always divided between good or bad and constantly questions his own morals. Oh and those Minions well, they do work as sidekick but yeah don't do any solo film for them anymore. Oh well good fun to spent some time but it doesn't really matter if you watch part one, two or three.",Despicable Me 3
71,cliftonofun,Fading fast,4,27 December 2017,"The first couple editions of this franchise worked well because they had clear characters and conflicts: a supervillain who suddenly becomes a dad, some orphaned girls who suddenly find a family. That dynamic worked, and the stories were interesting. Now? The studio seems to think the minions should get sub-plots and fart jokes should get even more attention and that new villains/family members will somehow generate the same heart. None of those things are true. This one felt disjointed and lacked all the feels. Basically, It only really worked when we got back to Gru and the girls, which was far too rarely. They can keep making Minion movies, but most of the grown-ups will be less interested.",Despicable Me 3
72,trinaboice,"Not as good as the first two, but still family fun",8,10 July 2017,"Grade: BRating: PG, 90 minutesIn a Nutshell: This is the 3rd installment in the Despicable Mefranchise (4th if you count Minions). It's not as good as the first two, but it's still silly fun for families.The detailed animation is absolutely outstanding. The movements, colors, textures, voices, water, and facial expressions are incredible. The physical humor is adorable.Uplifting theme: Family Kindness ImaginationThings I liked: I'm a twin, so I was excited to see Gru's twin. If you're one too, be sure to go to the annual ""Twins Days Festival"" in Twinsburg, Ohio at least once in your lifetime. It's awesome and hilarious. Steve Carell has always done an excellent job with Gru's lovable accent and now he adds a double who has a voice that is similar, yet different. Well done. The 80's villain ""Balthazar Bratt"" voiced by Trey Parker is really funny. I love his dance moves retro style. Watching him do aerobics on that exercise ball made me laugh out loud. Complete with a Michael Jackson cassette tape and bubblegum-launching shoulder pads, he steals every scene he is in. I love the detail of his bald spot. Dance battle! Pharrell Williams did most of the music, making for a foot-tapping soundtrack. The cutest musical moment for me was when the minions sing ""Papa Mama Loca Pipa"" in the ""Sing"" competition. I love Jenny Slate's voice and think she's perfect in animated movies. The lovely Julie Andrews gives us a cameo voice talent of Gru's mom. Other voice talents include Russell Brand, Steve Coogan, and the SNL favorite Kristen Wiig. The Cheese Festival had some fun features, like that slide grater people went down on a chunk of giant cheese. Ha ha I'd like a magical unicorn to help me do math too. Things I didn't like: As a mom, I don't appreciate that the advertising tagline is ""It's good to be bad."" Really? That's what you want to teach our kids? One of the Minions holds up a sign that says, ""Be bad!"" Some themes could have gone much deeper. Instead, there are a lot of story lines going on, so the movie just doesn't have time to explore them all. The movie never reaches a truly emotional moment like Pixar is so brilliant at doing. You'll chuckle, and maybe even a lot, but probably not belly-laugh.The finger-snapping Minions are still cute, but moving dangerously close to the annoying Jar Jar Binks status. In fact, they get crude and violent in this film. Not cool. Funny lines: ""Heist music!"" – Balthazar Bratt ""Dance fight!"" – Balthazar Bratt ""Son of a Beta Max!"" – Balthazar ""I saw a unicorn once."" – guy in a bar ""Was it fluffy?"" – Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) ""It was so fluffy I thought I was gonna die."" – guy ""Sqeeeeeeee!"" – Margo * ""Yes, Molly Ringwald. I will take you to the prom."" - Balthazar BrattTips for parents: You see Gru's naked back side. The minions stick out their tongues and say, ""Pffffth"" often. Fair warning: your little ones may think that's hilarious and want to imitate it. They're also going to want to hunt for a real unicorn. Squee!Animated violence and destruction.

Things_are_looking_up_for_Gru when_he_meets_his_twin_brother, Dru(Steve_Carrel), and_sets_up_a_plan_to_get_his_job_back_and_foil_Bratt's_scheme.This movie is far superior to that abomination called 'Minions'. I do suppose that slow and painful death would be better than that 'movie'. So it definitely gets points for not being Minions. That said, it is far inferior to Despicable Me 1 & 2. The cast is the same, the jokes are the same, the animation is the same; it just lacks heart. The first film had the girls, the second had Lucy - this has his brother but they don't explore the emotional aspect of that anymore than Transformers explores the deeper meaning of life and existence. If you wanna zone out for 90 minutes and let your young child be absorbed in bright colours, I recommend this movie. It's a good time waster but that is all it is. It has no purpose and that is a massive flaw of the movie. Not to say the rest of it is spectacular.The story, for example, is very weak. Don't give me that rubbish that this is a 'kid's movie'. It's animated; there is a difference. Pixar has literally created a template for how animated movies should appease all audiences, and 2/3 of this trilogy stuck to that template. This doesn't. The story is nonsensical and just has no rhyme or reason to it. It isn't logical and it doesn't contain enough meat to make it work. Clearly very swiftly thrown together and I expect more that that. The ending was also pretty childish but I guess it is fine for kids.One thing that I usually demand in animation is a good moral. Morals that affect both children and adults equally are the best kind. This movie lacks a moral entirely. They hint at a possible moral involving family and brotherhood but they never commit to it. That makes the entire viewing experience pointless. Kids should watch for enjoyment but also gain something from the experience. No moral makes this entire movie seem pointless and that isn't what your film should ever feel like.Stevel Carell is the only reason these movies are even remotely watchable. He's found the fine line between funny and obnoxious, and balances that tightrope perfectly. Carell is consistently funny throughout and maintains the glue that holds it together. Trey Parker was excellent as Bratt and was easily the best part of the movie. I adored every single scene he was in and he turned it from a plane crash into a train wreck, so a little big let horrific. Kristen Wig was good as Lucy and I did like the whole mother subplot. Nev Scharell was good as Agnes but her entire subplot was completely pointless. Miranda Cosgrove had negative seconds dedicated to her in this movie thus I shall not praise nor criticise her. Dana Gaier was fine in her limited screen time but that is another flaw of the film. The girls had no screen time. Agnes had a minor subplot, yes, but that meant nothing in the grand scheme of things. They were the heart and soul of the first movie yet had no time to blossom in this movie. If they gave a lot of focus to the relationship between either Gru and Dru, or Gru and Lucy but they don't and that is why this movie fails. I was very disappointed.What can every sane human being agree on? Minions are fine in minute doses. This was confirmed with 2015's Minions but Illumination saw it another way. They saw the critical panning of that atrocity to be a cry for 'we want MORE Minions'. This statement is both absurd and god damn ludicrous. Any human being who wishes for more of those yellow faced turnips has a special place for them reserved in hell because they are the bane of humanity! I guarantee if he was still with us, Hitler would have been a Minions fan. They're that despicable(pun intended). Stop shoving Minions down our throats. We DO NOT want more of them. Please. Stop. Technically speaking, I really like this movie. The colour pallet is very bright and illuminated(pun intended) that it just makes your eyes fixate to the screen. I imagine kids will appreciate the bright colours a lot, also. Models on the various characters were fun and inventive and fit well with the more exaggerated view of reality. Some nice shots and slithers of cinematography are sprinkled in there for good measure as well. As a whole, I was very, very pleased with the animation in this movie.Humour is a completely subjective thing and I won't completely criticise or praise a movie based on it. That said, I very rarely chuckled in this movie. I never gave a full laugh but some kids in the audience were laughing beyond belief so I guess they hit there target audience. I frequently smiled(and even chuckled) at Carrel and Parker but after them there was little for me to enjoy. They were the leads so it is fair they get the most jokes but even then none of them made me burst out laughing. Parker was easily the funniest part of the movie for me but the visual comedy he used probably impressed adults more than kids which I guess could be considered a flaw due to the villain not appealing to kids as much but I liked it so it gets a gold star in my book.Overall, I can recommend this movie if you want 90 minutes rest and are fine with your kids being absorbed by bright colours. I don't recommend this movie if your not in that position because it is lazy, nonsensical and unfunny. It lacks any heart to make it worthwhile and, aside from the animation, I cannot say anything really stood out. I'll rate it a disappointing 3 Moonwalks out of 10.",Despicable Me 3
79,scottshak_111,Entertaining as Ever,7,22 June 2017,"Whoever said one is enough. In a world of sequels, prequels and spin-offs, where more is considered to be better, Despicable Me 3 movie storms in like a flick that has still got some juice left. Well, who knew it really had! There are still plenty of things to milk, even though there was supposed to be a happy ending after every part. Plots are layered up deliberately to build something new and tacky, and boy has it worked every time. Luckily even this time it didn't disappoint.With a far-fetched plot to introduce Gru's twin brother Dru into the flick, Despicable Me 3 movie might have seemed a tad absurd from the trailers. But it turns out the movie is quite fun actually. It packs in ample humour if not matching the levels of its predecessors, gives every important character quite a good amount of screen time, making the minions hilarious as ever and builds up a great exciting villain from scratch.At times you feel the Despicable Me 3 movie drag a little, scrounging for every bit of story it could get, and there are countless occasions wherein you feel the dearth of humour badly. But it manages to hold tightly somehow owing to its calm sense of storytelling. It retains ample focus, constantly letting that smile stay on your face.Despicable Me 3 Movie Plot (Spoilers Ahead)For the plot here we have Gru (Steve Carrell) being kicked out from AVL (Anti-Villain League) along with his wife Lucy (Kristen Wiig) for being unable to capture Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker)even though he manages to save the world's most expensive diamond. With no jobs to support the family and reluctance to return to villainy, the Minions leave Gru.Gru comes to discover that he has a twin brother named Dru. He and his family are summoned by Dru for a visit. Despite starting off on a wrong foot he comes to adore Dru for trying to flicker that spark of villainy in him. Lucy is having a hard time being a mother, trying to get on the good side of the kids. Agnes, this time voiced by Nev Scharrel, is obsessed with finding a real unicorn. She finds a one-horned goat slapping that title on it, and loving it profusely even though Gru breaks it to her that unicorns aren't real.Meanwhile, Bratt steals the diamond back, and is on his way to execute his master plan of creating a monster sized version of him to destroy the city and make a major chunk of it fly. Also, as a side-plot, minions get arrested for trespassing from where they escape missing Gru terribly. After which, evil geniuses as they are, make an escape plan to reunite with him.The Mission to Mess with BrattGru and Dru get on a mission to bring the diamond back from Bratt as Dru beseeches him to teach villainy since it was in their blood. Gru agrees to it only secretly wishing to take the diamond back to AVL to get his and Lucy's jobs back. They infiltrate Bratt's den and somehow manage to get the diamond with the help of Lucy leaving Bratt in a sticky situation.On returning and after saying final goodbyes, taking the diamond away from Dru, having a minor spat with him for not leaving the diamond as a trophy, Gru and his family are all ready to board the plane. That's when Bratt shows up disguised as Lucy and steals the kids and the diamond along with him.He progresses with his plan to bring utter carnage by getting into his monster robot version and leaving the kids on a building's parapet. Gru reconciles with Dru and along with Lucy arrive to save the city. They meet minions on the way who begin following Gru.Lucy saves the children while Dru internally damages the giant monster robot. Gru involves himself in a ""dance fight"" with Bratt defeating him eventually as minions explode the giant bubble gums (the weapon of Bratt) to save the city.With diamond restored and Bratt captured, Gru and Lucy get their jobs back. The latter gets acknowledged as mother by the children which elates her beyond limit. Minions find a new villainous leader in Dru as they slink out at night to wreak some wicked havoc.The Proper FlowThe beauty of Despicable Me 3 movie lies in its proper flow of events. Everything happens for a reason and everything has a natural order to it and they were bound to happen. There is ample focus in the frames, and things are less cartoonish than they used to be in other movies of Illumination Entertainment.It doesn't forget the minions even though they revolt and aren't with the primary story-line of the movie. Directors Kyle Balda, Pierre Coffin and Eric Guillon still find a way to include them by giving them a funny plot to chase. We have a new revolting minion named Mel who is introduced brilliantly into the tale.There are important things you can take from the movie too. Gru's incapability to break a hopeful Agnes's heart when he wished to tell her about the unicorn's existence, and then breaking it to her anyway when the chips were down, and Agnes's acceptance to focus on the good things, her optimistic nature have been beautifully inserted. She is very thoughtful in trying to help Gru by selling her toys to make the difference.The Final VerdictIllumination Entertainment has been now paying attention to the bridges that were missing from a lot of its previous projects. Despicable Me 3 movie is quite an entertainer. It scores a little bit less in terms of humour but yes its very relatable. You will thoroughly enjoy it.",Despicable Me 3
80,coreyjdenford,They're Despicably funny,6,30 June 2017,"This review of Despicable Me 3 is spoiler free*** (3/5)THE ULTIMATE WEAPON for the first Despicable Me was success, not only in box-office numbers gaining a reputation as one of the most successful franchises in Universal Pictures history (a close second to The Fast & Furious franchise). Also earning success in both merchandising and internet fame there were thousands of memes more notably it was Felonious Gru's (Steve Carell) little yellow companions spawning the most fame for the series. Henceforth a poster child was born. Also with Despicable Me 2 and a prequel Minions the series shows no sign of slowing down. The third in the series is a right-off, Felonious Gru and his minions are back causing mayhem, in perhaps the most polished of the franchise from it's opening it shines with quality and as far as chronological standards go the third in the series is always the best. This is true for Despicable Me 3, it's brimming with colour, there's a new story, a new villain Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker) who uses his smooth 80s fashion and party mode dancing to slide his way through a heist in the film's funny opening. And our lovable villain turned nice guy Gru has settled down with his wife, Lucy (Kristen Wiig) and his three adopted girls. After he is fired from his job at the anti-villain league he's now looking for work, he soon finds out he has a long-lost brother; Dru (Carell) and its here that it has the most energy.Gru meets his more charming, cheerful, and more successful brother with his long gold locks of hair, they decide to work together as an anti-villain duo. This is a polished animated comedy which shines in its fast paced wit, yet again it's those minions that standout particularly in a spectacular mayhem causing section in a prison. They're relentless yet again as they gain the most laughs.Sadly, it's a flawed slightly cartoonish venture for Gru and friends as the jokes fall flat as they try to catch their villain, as the film progresses there's more of an effort to stretch for a giggle. Thankfully the top notch writing and fresher ideas stop this from running too far. That said, the film is jam packed with ideas, a villain who loves bubble gum and uses it as a weapon is particularly fresh, there's a final scheme using sticky gear that shines in quality and finally the minions keep it fresh with their plans too. Despite its flaws Despicable Me 3, is a hilarious and energetic addition to the franchise which brims in quality, fresh ideas and a harmonious sense of joy, and is by far the best in the franchise.VERDICT: The third in the series is a hilarious and energetic addition that glosses in quality and shines in its fast paced wit that has just enough energy to seemingly continue forever.",Despicable Me 3
81,jtncsmistad,"""Despicable Me 3"": More of the same. Only not enough of it.",6,1 July 2017,"The just-released animated comedy ""Despicable Me 3"" is a movie that probably didn't need to be made. But don't try telling to that to the filmmakers. They're far to busy bathing in the billions this mega-popular franchise has brought them since the first one lit up theater screens back in 2010.Oh, Steve Carell and Kristen Wiig are just fine as the two leads, with ample lines to have you laughing out loud while perpetuating the pair's solid chemistry. But there's just not a helluva lot of new ground being covered here. And curiously, neither the hilarious legion of those yellow yucksters, the Minions, nor the crazy cute trio of kids is featured with any degree of purposeful prominence.And the third wheel who WAS shown the spotlight, for my money (and I did pay to see this flick) shouldn't have been. Trey Parker. Stick to your gift of creating cartoons like the iconic ""South Park"" and not to lending voice to the characters in them. Valiant effort to be sure. But you just did not do it for me here, bro. In fact, you might say that you killed all the entertainment right out of your overwrought role much like you off poor Kenny practically each week on your satirically sardonic TV series.",Despicable Me 3
82,Puroo,It was pretty funny but did we really need this?,8,14 July 2021,"I had watched Despicable Me only so that I could finally understand what the whole deal with the minions was. But I ended up liking the movie and all the characters in that. As a result I decided to watch the sequel as well, which I ended up liking even more than the first one. So I thought why not just go all out and watch every single movie? And so I watched this one, and I really I think it was not something really great, although it did manage to do what it was meant to do: give us the laughs and have a good time.Despicable Me 3 is about Gru finding out about his estranged brother Dru who is living a very rich life but does not have the evil nature of Gru and thus is not liked as much by his family. And so grew is forced to take his brother along with him to stop the evil villain Balthazar Bratt, a child actor from the 80s who has faded away with time. Although the minions in this movie are way less than the previous two I don't mind this at all. In fact I kind of found them annoying and I wanted more of the human characters than those yellow Facebook meme sources.Balthazar is my favourite villain from this franchise. All his acts are very funny. Whenever he is on the screen you know you are in for some good time. There are often callbacks to his show which is very campy and has barred CGI according to today's times, which is just like how we see shows from the 80s today. He always dances and plays songs whenever he is out on the heist. It is fun to watch Gru and Balthazar fight in the opening scene and also the way Baltasar dances as he defeats all the guards on the ship.The animation of this movie is way better than the previous two, especially when it comes to the action scenes and car chasing. What this movie lacks in however, is the amount of campiness and cliched moments of having an amateur person come out on a secret mission along with the professional friend/family member. In fact the whole idea of the protagonist having an estranged twin brother is a cliched idea which has been used many times in Bollywood films.Although this isn't a very memorable movie, it does exactly what all the other movies from this franchise do. It is able to create a fantasy world with fun and loving characters who do goofy things and we enjoy them while it lasts. And this is the reason why I don't think this franchise should have more movies. By the time one movie comes we have already forgotten what happened in the previous one. Although I wouldn't say that this is a bad movie, I would definitely say that you would not remember anything other than the good parts once the movie ends, and this is the reason why this movie is so much fun to remember since I don't exactly remember what I didn't like about it.",Despicable Me 3

So this is the third outing for Gru and his girls, and his weird dog, and his many many minions. I for one am happy to get back to the old team, I found the Minions film a little too much Minion. This outing gives us another outrageous villain, a guy called Balthazar Bratt, a character completely stuck in the 80s with his music and his dance moves and armed with expanding bubble gum as his weapon of choice. Throw into the mix the discovery that Gru has in fact got a twin brother called Dru and you've got a pretty watchable film. I can't say it was outrageously funny but I did giggle throughout. The humour is very Benny Hill in its slapstick delivery and throw in the sheer determination of Agnes that the existence of unicorns is true, you have quite an endearing film to keep you entertained for a while.",Despicable Me 3

86,kermitkid,Learned from mistakes of sequel,8,30 March 2020,"Going in, I was expecting this to be pretty weak. I wasn't in the mindset that I was going to hate it, just that at best, it would be OK. It's the 3rd (4th if you count ""Minions"") entry in an animated film series. Most franchises by this point have thrown in the towel as far as effort is concerned and just said ""Forget it. Put little to no effort into this. Just put something together to shut kids up for 90 minutes. They'll eat it up anyway."" Happy to say, that was not the case with this one. Not only was there effort, but they've also learned from their mistakes. I said in my review of the second one that the film had too many scenes focusing on the Minions, which overshadowed the rest of the plot. They remembered this time that people like the Minions, we just like them in small increments that are few and far between. They were in it for maybe 15 minutes of the whole thing. I feel one way the film could have improved was to flesh out the villain a little better. I thought he was one of the best parts, and would have loved to see more. He's a former child star, mentally trapped in the 80s, and so there are a lot of 80s references and songs. This was a concept that I felt could have done more than what was done here. They had so many oppurtunities with this that they missed out on. I would have loved to see more 80s references. The plot was pretty paint-by-numbers, and I could tell for the most part where it was going to go, but some things still surprised me. Not my favorite in the franchise, but certainly not the weakest.

But personally, I don't rate originality so very high. What you'll find here, is just as my title said: some new variations on the same old story with the same old plot twists and the same old characters. Obviously, the villains have been replaced by new villains, which look like the same old villains. But it's like a great symphony, you can hear it over and over again without being bored, as long as the performance is good.Well the performance is superb. Once again it's slapstick of the highest quality, with just enough wit to tickle our brain. Once again it's a story about the triumph of family and family love over anything trying to separate its members. Yes it's sugarcoated, but the constant appeal to our laughing bone makes the whole thing edible, and as I already said, fun to eat, (and watch).",Despicable Me 3
89,WalkdenEntertainment,"O Brother, Where Art Thou?",6,10 January 2019,"Ex-villain and mastermind Gru (Voiced by Steve Carell) returns to the world of criminal super hero activity. The film continues where Despicable Me 2 left off: Gru is currently spending life with his wife, Lucy, and his three little girls, continuing to fight against any villains.Gru's world begins to fall apart after a mission to capture the well known 80's child star turned villain, 'Balthazar Bratt' (voiced by South Park's Trey Parker), results in failure. As a result of this mission, both Gru and Lucy are relieved of their duties. As Gru deals with many changes, he soon discovers his long-lost, charming, cheerful, and more successful twin brother, Dru (also voiced by Steve Carell), who desires to team up with his brother for one last criminal heist.For me personally, I can understand why the 'Despicable Me' franchise has been successful. With a total of four films now (including the crafty spinoff prequel film 'Minions') Despicable Me has won fans with their continuous random humour (which you can mostly thank the Minions for). The films always end with a great message for children (and some adults). Similar to other successful DreamWorks films like Shrek, many of the jokes here will go over the heads of younger audiences and please the older cinema crowd. Our new villain, for example, is an 80's child star and naturally dances to songs that only an older generation can understand.The biggest downfall in Despicable Me 3 is the writers appearing to aim for a much bigger and wider plots and side story within the film. Throughout the film, many key characters have 'other' interests/side stories but the end results are only minor character developments and even this character development never really feels complete or successful compared to the previous films. By the time the film ended there were multiple side stories that made me question ""What was the point of that side story... and where did it go?"" But of course, when you're watching a film where yellow creatures get tattoos of bananas on their bottoms (hehehe bottom) what else would one expect.Despicable Me 3 will please fans. Actor Steve Carell provides double the amount of talented voice work thanks to the new addition character. I also enjoyed the new creative super villain that goes up against Gru. My biggest disappointment is the resolution of selected sub plots and the characters. Nevertheless, I feel most fans will be pleased.6.1/10

90,austin0731,"Another sequel that raises the question, ""Do we need more of this minion stuff?""",4,2 July 2017,"Hard to imagine that a few years ago this Universal's property would blow up to such proportions but with expansion comes a lack of quality. When the first Despicable Me came around it was really good, it tried not only to appeal to the children but also adult audiences which ended up being something special. Nowadays I can't even remember when minions weren't a source of irritation, that there was a time when minions were actually a comedic side character that had any purpose. So about Despicable Me 3, it packs in a few story lines and follows the characters in their own separate narratives. This was something that I thought reduced all the characters because the strength of the franchise in my opinion is unity and family, when all the characters play off each other that's when it can be good whereas splitting them off into their own adventures just takes away from all the characters themselves. On a positive note in terms of characters Trey Parker's Balthazar Bratt was undoubtedly the best part of Despicable Me 3. The voice acting and just his whole character was fresh, interesting and funny. However his character is sidelined for most of this film. This film also chose to depict a 'leader' minion, Mel which was something I did not like. Other than the fact that this character has never been featured in any of the past films it just seems odd for the minions to have a leader, I always though what worked about them was how they acted as a unit. Another issue I had and I believe many other adult audiences should see this too is the missed opportunity in tackling mature issues, for example Lucy trying to be a mother to the three children or Dru and Dru both being a disappointment to their father/mother. This was an issue that should have been delved into more, this would have been the elevation that this film needed rather than being a big explosion of jokes and skits while avoiding the 'hard topics' and not letting it live up to its potential. Especially in a day where we have Pixar doing this successfully, Disney Animation's Zootopia In a day of an evolving audience base studios shouldn't be so reluctant to discuss these issues.",Despicable Me 3

There was not one single scene in the entire film, where I was even close to a laugh.I watched it, in the monthly film night with over 120, five-ten year olds and over 200 including everyone. I did not hear a single laugh from anybody in the entire film and have never seen so many children up and walking around, completely bored by it.There is not a single quality, I could say that it offers. The plot goes nowhere and jumps.around, the Minions add nothing. The villain comes and goes with no real reason and has no character development, nor really does the brother who seems a pointless add on.You will not miss anything by skipping this.",Despicable Me 3
92,FelipeCarrillo,Is Gru returning or saying goodbye?,6,20 August 2017,"After the unthinkingly massive success that DreamWorks Animation got in world of children's cinema seven years ago, Gru and his fellow believers became, at the speed of light, in cult characters and direct representatives of pop culture, attaining, at the expense of their magnetic attraction components for audience (a funny and vile villain, a triad of girls with unbearably loving eyes and yellow beings in the form of pills that communicate each other by mixing dozens of languages) a second installment directed by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud and a spin-off in 2015. Today, it arrives—using as inspiration the money generated by the three previous ones—a third film with Gru as ""only"" protagonist, cornering a second place to the Minions, alternating their participation in form of escape quite similar to John Sturges's ""The Great Escape"" with Agnes' cravings for meeting a unicorn in the real world, a loving sub-plot between Margo and a village dweller, Lucy's efforts to become a good mother, the ghosts from the past that instigate Gru to leave behind the life of responsible father, the impact that his twin brother causes and the chase of the main villain who radiates 80's style through and through. They said that Hollywood original ideas had no longer a place in an American blockbuster, they are wrong, here there are, but with an oversaturation of stories that conclude condemning the feature film to the ranks of the summer film for lucrative purposes, one brimming with nutty entertainment just like the franchise.The new ingredients of the recipe are introduced with independence, namely, are like mini-episodes attached with roughness in a story where coherence is conspicuous by its absence, but after all, that's the meaning of an animated film, a manumission from the ordinary world for the audience, however, doesn't enable it to insert a jerk of situations as diverse as unrelated. In addition to repletion of ideas that aren't boldness, there's a technical and visual section that doesn't exhibit fresh optimizations, the optical potential of a couple of scenes is hampered by the interception of previously commented sub-plots. Nonetheless, there is room for drama and action sequences, orchestrated with ability, in which they employ a palette of vivacious colors, graphics emulating reality with care and a photography elevating Chris Meledandri's proposal to the next level, at least visually.Regarding the most recent affiliations, antagonist Balthazar Bratt, an eighties star who is turned down publicly and commercially thanks to the arrival of pubescence and Dru, Gru's twin brother, an almost identical clone of the main character, except for a fulgent blonde mane and a snowy trousseau, provide a breath of fresh air to a universe with immeasurable possibilities ranging from peripheral products to worthy characters of their own installment, however, the captured effect isn't bilateral. Bratt's introduction, deploying a James Bond-style espionage plot, in the first two acts is tedious, lifeless and discouraged, it's not until the final apotheosis the extravagances of the former child idol consolidate motivations by which he goes villainy, crushing, allegorically, the emblematic Hollywood sign located at Monte Lee, Los Angeles. Dru doesn't get a completely interesting and innovative treatment, as a standalone character, however, his development is more enjoyable when he does a duet with his brother, opening the way for slapstick comedy. It's engrossing the final twist that, without resorting to spoilers, is a required and coherent exit to continue with the general leitmotiv of the universe. One more time, we again witness amusing and argumentative expertise containing the Minions as supporting characters. They pass through a strike against their own master, the participation in a singing talent show and the escape of a high-security prison. Without a doubt, they're Squirrel Scraft counterpart in ""Ice Age"" franchise, that was used as a magnetic mechanism, something audience loves, especially the little ones.The atmosphere impregnated by the villain is something unexplored for Dreamworks animations, making use of angles and editions of that time, in order to give cohesion to the past of the villain, nonetheless, visual achievements are not enough, they got with the character; soundtrack, present in most of his appearances, is made up of classics already established as ""Bad"" by Michael Jackson or ""99 Luftballons"" by Nena, beating around the bush with own musical compositions that had to be highlighted in the film.With a story going nowhere because of the torrent of sub plots that the screenwriters embed in the middle of the footage, ""Despicable Me 3"", directed by Pierre Coffin, Kyle Balda and Eric Guillon, will please lovers of animated espionage and adults avid for an evening of cinema without demands, at the expense of the voice performances, the inherently hilarious occurrences of the Minions and incessant references to the 80's culture. For everyone else, the latest foray into children's cinema, the result of the alliance between Illumination and Dreamworks, falls by the wayside thanks to a creative mess that cannot be saved by a graphic section worthy of consideration, something that is not a matter of surprise nowadays.",Despicable Me 3

95,pinkarray,They need to stop making bucks off of these movies,4,11 July 2017,"The first Despicable Me I really enjoyed, the second one was okay but not that great, the Minions one was mediocre, and this third one is iffy. Despicable Me has also had shorts and I saw a few of them like the House Makeover one, the Training Wheels one, and the one that played before Secret Life of Pets. The Training Wheels one was okay, the House Makeover one was pretty good, but the one that played before Secret Life of Pets was sub-par.I think that they need to stop milking this franchise because Despicable Me is just getting worse and worse with each movie and short and from the cliffhanger in the end, I could tell that there's probably going to be a fourth one about Dru's career as a villain. And what's going to happen? Dru and maybe even Gru are going to meet their dad who they haven't seen in a long time and maybe bring him into the family? Are the girls going to find out that their biological parents abandoned them and leave Gru to live with their parents? And what if they make a T.V. series?None of the characters I thought were very good and are shadows of their former selves. The new characters, Evil Bratt is obvious and Dru is an unnecessary character, he caused trouble for Gru and doesn't even know how to drive yet he has a car. Lucy is annoying with how aggressive and hyper she acts and an unnecessary mom and teammate of Gru and she and Gru are burdening a 6-year-old little girl with stuff about work. Which I think is too much for a 6 year old to comprehend. Not to mention, the kids act too precocious now. Like how could a 6-year-old girl know how to cook soup? She also sold her unicorn, well, Despicable Me is dead now. Isn't she too young to be even thinking about businesses anyway? And she adopts a goat? Why would she adopt a wild animal? And the minions are now more annoying trouble-makers than ever.There are too many popular songs in there. But I really loved the end credits song. This movie is kind of like a rehash of Despicable Me 1, 2, and Minions. A villain causes destruction to the town towards the end, the girls get kidnapped by the villain, and a boy falls in love with Margo and even talks about getting engaged with her even though they're too young. And he also does embarrassing things such as smooching all over her.Edith's voice actor sounded a bit too old for her age.There are a few good things to say about this film, the action scenes are alright, there were some heart-warming moments between Gru and Dru and I like how they help each other, and I also like how they got three different stories going on, one about Lucy and the girls, one about the Minions, and one about Gru and Dru being spies. Agnes's new voice actor did pretty good on her character and I think she sounds kind of like Elsie Fischer, but I still miss Elsie Fischer's sweet, babyish voice but she no longer has that voice.This movie was clichéd, silly, cartoonish, predictable, slow, and therefore boring. I barely laughed at even one part, the humor was lowbrow and the dialogue foolish.

97,AnishMisra,Despicable me 3 Review,7,20 June 2017,"Despicable M3 is a film directed by Pierre Coffin and Kyle Balda. Honestly speaking I am a fan of this series. I loved the first two films, the Minions spin off was also OK. I saw both the trailers of the film and loved them.Plot: Gru faces off with a new villain named Balthazar Bratt and simultaneously also bonding with his long lost twin brother Dru.Story and direction: Despicable Me franchise is the most successful one of the Illumination's production. And as I said before, I am a fan of the series. I saw the first scene and I thought, ""Yes I am about to get a great film"". But that was it. Yup. That was it. But I am not saying it was a bad film. Despicable Me has not produced a great villain since Vector (who was both funny and menacing). Balthazar is a very flat character. I was shouting to please give some character to it. But thank god for introducing Gru's brother. That portion was actually kind of good. I hoped the writers could have actually focused on that. Also the Minions were very small portion in the film. Yes. I know here Gru is the main person. But still..... Here Gru's mother and Dr. Nefario (non Existent in this film) who are also some great characters were not given scope. We have some very silly kind of subplots like Agnes trying to get a unicorn, Margo being forced into an engagement, etc... Even the ending left a possibility for the fourth film. If this film would have focused on the two brothers, it would have been great.Favorite Scene: I guess it would be where the Minions go in a studio and sing a song in their Minion language. That was a great scene.Verdict: This film is actually better than the Minions spin off. But yes, the first two were far better. I still am crossing fingers for a good fourth film.I will go with 7/10.",Despicable Me 3

I think it is on par with the first movie and a bit better than the second one. In this chapter, Gru meets his twin brother Dru, who both must work together to stop Balthazar Bratt, an 80's-obsessed supervillain and former child actor out for vengeance.The movie doesn't waste a minute of time and moves at a very fast pace. The jokes and action come rapid-fire, but never wear on the viewer or become ineffective. The plot has enough twists and turns to stop it from being formulaic, and the movie has some excellent and funny references to the previous two films. Finally, Bratt is a perfect villain for this type of film and is too tongue-in-cheek to resist. It probably helps too that I'm also a big fan of Trey Parker (who voices him) and his show ""South Park,"" but he manages to make the character incredibly funny. While the 80's music and references stemming from his character will probably go over the heads of the kids in the audience, their parents won't be able to stop laughing at those moments. While there are some lines that don't work (e.g. fart jokes) for anyone except the young ones in the crowd, the vast majority of the script is very clever. All in all, this is a funny and sweet sequel with witty writing, an enjoyable plot, and a very memorable villain. 8/10Note: I saw this film in Dolby Cinema, which is a new premium format that was installed at an AMC theater very close to me a few months ago. This was the first movie I have seen in that format. The clarity of the picture and sound quality were impressive, although I did find the sound a little bit too loud in some scenes for my liking (which is a bit odd, since when I saw 'Wonder Woman' in IMAX 3D at the same theater, the sound--while powerful and thrilling during the action scenes--did not feel too loud.) All in all, I enjoyed the Dolby experience.",Despicable Me 3

Steve Carell was great, the Shrek like story had a real sense of humour and heart to it, and the minions were first introduced firmly in their place, the background. Unfortunately the success of this one film meant the rise of the Minion by Illumination, an animated film company that has yet to make a film anywhere near as good since. Now after an okay second film, an abomination of a spin off and the extremely bland Secret Life of Pets, Illumination brings us Despicable Me 3. I was hopeful going in, the first film was great and the second was also enjoyable, so the third film should be an improvement upon the Minions movie right? Well yes, but Despicable Me 3 is yet another cash grab sequel that proves that this franchise has done all it can and is on the brink of death.The producers of this franchise know who their audience are and who buys their ancillary markets, although both audiences aren't necessarily one and the same, the producers seem to think so and thus have made this film for the merchandise buyers, aka super mainstreamers and children The third Despicable Me film is the first in the trilogy to abandon attempts to please the family unit, in favour of appealing to 4-12 year old's and anyone with a Minion phone case. As a consequence, the film contains an endless barrage of idiotic slapstick comedy, crappy puns, stupid voices, silly dances, as well as, Minion babble So literally nothing we haven't already seen, and seen done better in this case, in every single kids and family film ever madeThe biggest issue for me was the films humour, or better yet, lack of humour, as it was so horrifically bad that I seriously questioned every punchlines, do people actually think that these jokes are funny or are they meant to be ironic? Is the joke that these jokes are so painfully unfunny? I genuinely don't know. I do know however, that when i did laugh, which was rare, it was ironically, as this film is littered with cliché and cringey jokes which are delivered with a slight level of uncertainty by the voice actors, to which lead me to question it being ironic or not. About midway through the film there is a dinner scene which was the tipping point for me. I found myself in such discomfort, due to the scenes extremely unfunny nature and large levels of cringe, that I was hysterical, unable to contain my laughter for all the wrong reasons. Despicable Me 3 is so unfunny that it's even funny at times, but you have solider through the field of cringe and discomfort that comes with the films grating sense of humour. If Sandra Bullock and Jon Hamm can't save the Minions movie, Trey Parker and another Steve Carell cannot save Despicable Me 3The film itself does what the Minions Movie did even worse, and that is not fully commit to certain plot lines. The film introduces the villain Balthazar Bratt in the opening, only to have him do nothing for the rest of the film, in favour of a brotherly love story between Steve Carell and Steve Carell. The film does cut back to Bratt and doesn't forget about him completely, but he feels very out of place once Dru is introduced. As well as this, the film recycles the same two or three sub plots from the first two films; There is a struggle with a character about being a parent (In this case, Lucy), Gru struggling with the urge to be bad when he knows he must be good for the 'Gurls!', and the Minions get a side story because Minions are the hottest of sh*t in the 2010's.Lastly, Kristen Wiig comes off as excruciatingly awful in this film in large part due to the films unfunny nature. Kristen Wiig is an awkward comedy comedian and thus relies heavily on good material to work with, otherwise it's just cringe. All of Lucy's humour falls flat on its face as the material given isn't good, and Wiig's performance overall comes off as desperate-for-a-laugh because of this. Sorry Kristen :(.To conclude, Despicable Me 3 is not the quality boost the franchise needed, but rather proves that the Despicable Me franchise has nothing more to offer us. The films have become more accessories to the Minion Merch with every new instalment and I pray that they please let this die as this film proves that it is ready for the sweet release of death. This is a huge shame as Despicable Me in 2010 was a great film, now ruined by a series of cash grab sequels that are the reason The Emoji Movie exists Thanks a lot Gru, thanks a lot.",Despicable Me 3
100,e-67102-48412,Looking forward to the next one,8,19 April 2020,"This movie has been touched by joy. Every time it brings us a different experience, Gru has changed from a bad guy to joining the anti-villain alliance, has a new wife, and then has twins.It's worth a look, but it feels like the end of the Hollywood movie is always too short and the bad guy will soon be defeated by good people. The excitement is a little unsatisfactory.",Despicable Me 3
101,anthonyf94,Cattivissimo but not so Cattivissimo,6,18 August 2019,"""Cattivissimo me 3"" is a good sequel considering that is the fourth film of the series. But if the dialectic is between the good brother and the bad one, it has still sense talking about the main character as a super-villain? It's true that also the other chapters showed how behind the rind of a evil there is a semi-good man - and it's a classic: sane reassurancism. But the first two films were more strictly built on the overturning of the classical fairy hero and ratio, that is lost in his major part in this film. It's easier to bend the narrative flow to gag occasions for the Minions, by now the popular acclaimed characters, after the 2015's spin-off.",Despicable Me 3
102,rohanumpleby,Underatted movie,6,6 July 2021,"The soundtrack is perfect, I love Bad buy Micheal Jackson. The villain had an interesting motive. Grut's brother owns a posh house, I cool it a posh house anyway. He also seems to have a wonderful looking garden, with great effects. I laughed a bunch of times and had a fun and joyful time watching this movie. I went to look at it's rating and it only gets a 6.3/10. I know a bad movie when I see one, like Boss Baby which somehow gets the same rating as this, Charlotte Webb movies are crap and all that, but no not this movie. I found the plot to not be too confusing, and I actually found the acting and the humour to be really good. Late Reviewer 🙃Rating: 6.5/10.",Despicable Me 3
103,nahumthebest,a great family movie; the best of the three films so far; antagonist underwhelming for most part; great ending as usual,10,6 July 2020,"100% spoiler-free.I think this is my favorite of the trilogy so far. I liked Gru having a larger family. The brother was an excellent addition to the family and was a well-developed, very funny and memorable character.On a separate note, I was not happy with this movie's antagonist for most of the film, until the last part of the film when the antagonist finally did something worthy of my attention. He had been a very underwhelming and boring antagonist so far. But he stepped it up at the end and made it worth the wait.Conclusion: I think this is the best of the three main films so far. Love seeing Gru with three daughters, a wife, and a twin brother. How cool is that? This is a family movie no doubt. The ending was great as usual. It is a must-watch.10/10",Despicable Me 3
104,wisemantonofski,Gru vs. Dru Would Have Been Better,6,11 February 2019,"While not as laugh-a-minute entertaining as its predecessors, the third installment of this series still has a lot of the heart and ingenuity of the original. There are important lessons about childhood wonder, sibling rivalry and motherhood tucked into a flick thats enjoyable enough, but I cant help but think that the animation in the movie's credits would have made a better story, of a reformed brother and a criminal brother constantly battling to outwit one another in a series of entertaining entanglements. Maybe next time.",Despicable Me 3
105,T-ZER0,Not as well written as the first two..,1,19 June 2019,"Despicable Me 3, what happened? It seems like the writers were running out of ideas. The Despicable Me movies have always been able to influence how much a certain family member was needed. The first one told about how Gru loved and needed the girls, the second told how the girls wanted a mom and Gru wanted a wife. This one was supposedly about Gru meeting his long lost brother. But there is no good reason why he needs his brother at all. Just for continuity sake I guess.The minions are not funny on this film, they just drag the plot along, and make you wonder when they will just disappear. Lucy is trying to get used to her role as a mother, but does terrible. She literally forces Margo to participate in a courting ceremony just so she could look Maternal? Bad, just bad.Next, Agnes and her unicorn. Of course she learns that a crazy guy says he saw a unicorn in The Valley, so she goes to find one. While watching I was thinking: ""They're going to make her find one because they think she's adorable. They're going to make her find one because they think she's adorable"". I was half right. She found a goat, but the fact that they passed it off as a unicorn shows how bad this series is going.Finally, the villain. He doesn't deserve for me to mention his name, that's how forgettable he was. Honestly, it's not menacing or scary when your villain just says over and over ""I'VE BEEN A BAD BOY!"" It just makes them seem immature. Vector and El Macho were different. Vector was nerdy, but he could pose a threat when needed. El Macho was menacing, and he knew what he was doing the whole time. This villain was terrible, he brought down the movie even more. The fact that he forced Gru, the former master of all evil to do a dance fight was just cringeworthy.Will I see Despicable Me 4? Probably, it depends on if the franchise redeems itself. Right now, it's starting to become Ice Age.",Despicable Me 3
106,Equalizer16,Innosent fun but not great,6,3 July 2017,"Illumination continue to make as much money out of the minions as possible, even thought the minions are barley in this one.Steve Carell returns as ex criminal Gru, with his three girls, wife Lucy (Kristin Wig) and of course the minions in another despicable adventure of mishaps, slapstick, and nonsensical language. After a failed mission working for the AVL (Anti-Villain-League), Gru and Lucy are fired for unsuccessfully apprehending out of date 80's child star turned villain Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker). From here Gru discovers his long lost twin brother Dru also voiced by Carell who invites Gru and his family to his house in Freedonia.I am big fan of the first two Despicable Me films, (have not seen the Minions movie) which are both full of great characters, jokes, quirks, and fun, however what the third one has brought us is another messy chapter of various undeveloped plots and characters with a lack of original comedy and too much reliance on the childish comedy coming from the minions. But is stupidly gets away with it.One of the key things I have enjoyed about the Despicable Me films was the characters of Gru, and the girls, whereas it is common knowledge that the fundamental selling point of the franchise is the minions, who although are fun to watch are not the chuckling point. Alternatively this time, the minions were the only really funny part, which became a weakness when their screen time becomes limited. At one point Gru even says ""I miss the minions"" and can't help but think that me and the rest of the audience are thinking the same thing every time their off screen. But in the end there is enough comedy and childish humor to satisfy your children overall.Another key issue is the narrative and structural issues. The film sets up several different plots and subplots which give the film a lack of direction and one key story arc. These are then either wrapped up really quickly or not even concluded.But the key problem is the character development. The problem is that their isn't any. When we left Gru last, he had married Lucy, which was one think I was hoping to see in development, but actually their marriage is never really touched upon. What is though is Lucy's relationship with the girls, but this is one of these rushed subplots. The main emphasis is on Gru's relationship with Dru which becomes too much as Carell stretches his high pitched German accent. Finally of course there is Balthazar Bratt who is probably the only treat for the parents with his nostalgic 80s style, costume and dance taking them back to the disco age of the past, but I still not quite enough to cause tears of laughter.Although I mention these problems, the easy to watch, charm, and humor are just enough to roughly save the film, but still not to a great quality. This therefore becomes just an easy film for the kids pretty much, but if your are massive Despicable Me enthusiast, you may be either pleasantly satisfied or disappointed. 6.4/10",Despicable Me 3
107,trevorwomble,Not bad but not enough Minions (and no bananas!),6,3 July 2017,"I have to say I was slightly disappointed with DM3. Whist it was amusing enough it lacked the spark that made DM1 & 2 so enjoyable. Whilst the Minions movie showed that the Minions really needed Gru to bring out the best comedy in them, DM3 showed just how thin a character Gru is without the Minions constant rudeness and slapstick to effortlessly carry things along (and I missed Dr Nefario's drollness to slow things down compared to Gru's constant showboating). There was also a feeling of compromise with several of the famous 80s pop songs in the soundtrack finishing just before the vocals started, showing the producers clumsy attempt to save money on the production budget. After the heady high of the Village People ending in DM2 I felt a bit short changed this time round and it kind of ruined the fun.Whilst I suspect the film will do great box office and a DM4 is almost inevitable I really hope that the writers and producers look at the comments here and realise how close they came to a misfire with this film. The writing was lazy, the fun music soundtrack was poorly done and the minions were badly missed for the majority of the film.DM1 was an unexpectedly massive hit when it first came out and it led to a superb sequel and a spin off that wasn't bad but could have been better. Unfortunately I feel DM3 is going to be a turning point, either it is the start of a decline in the material and writing or it will give Universal studios a massive kick in the butt that they could do better next time round if they want to keep the quality in the franchise. I really hope they take notice.",Despicable Me 3
108,jeannefrancoise,A fun and ordinary minions movie,7,23 July 2017,"Despicable Me 3 for me is a fun movie to be watched with your family or best friends. This movie does not really in link with the previous movies that tell us story about the minions, this movie is about the family, but at this Despicable Me 3 there is no such surprises, for example in the movie banner, the audience already knew who is the new actor in this movie. Yes, the brother of Gru: Dru. The plot how Dru can meet Dru is not really special. They just meet by well-planned meeting. They are connecting each other and then they are feeling each other as twin brothers. But what is the link of the appearance of the twin brother to the whole movie plot is not really useful. This movie seems to have two plots: First is the meeting between the Dru and Gru and the second plot is how to win over the enemy (you will know whom). That is why I said that this Despicable Me 3 has less of surprises than before, but the fun is just the same. The role of minions are also less attracting than before, but the audience is full guaranteed that minions are always the core of the movie that causes of all problems, as well as solutions, so that I am hoping the Despicable Me 4, maybe? :)",Despicable Me 3
109,sjarja,Boring,4,17 September 2017,"I do reckon that at 31 years - i am not the target audience of this movie. There are of course movies that address both, children and adults alike - but this is not one of those.The plot was ... pretty stupid. Not stupid in a comedic way - but stupid in a ""that makes no sense"" way. There was no notable character progression, the minions were a snooze and the newly introduced characters made no sense. Shedding light on Grus past might have been interesting, especially since there was the scene of a young Gru in the minions movie - but instead we got a kind of family reunion with little to no impact at all. So they just got to know each other - and they like each other .. well, good. Thats it.The villain - the most important part of such a movie - was rather weak, too for my taste. Memorable in design and behaviour, but rather weak in terms of motivation and threat. (considering Gru had to deal with a genius villain that was trying to steal the moon in the first movie ... the villain in the 3rd was just a substantial step down)Jokes fell mostly flat - but there weren't many for an adult audience.I d say - a nice movie for kids, but in contrast to some of the classic pixar movies ... not for adults.",Despicable Me 3
110,twpain,Decent but not great,6,21 June 2020,I would give this film probably a 6.3-6.4. There was a few good laughs in this film but I didn't find it as funny as the other entries in the series. I didn't love the plot line with Gru's brother Dru but I didn't find it awful either. The three kids were fun in this movie like usual and Lucy becoming a Mom figure is also cute. Add to that I really like the villain and he matches up with the other villains in the series. I wish we had a little more time with the minions in this film. Overall this is a decent sequel that is a little overshadowed by its predecessors.,Despicable Me 3
111,Elivx,Underrated Sequel!,8,8 October 2020,"It's about time when we look at a sequel that is one of the totally underrated films ever made with so many negative reviews going towards it, which it doesn't. Hey c'mon people, is it really that bad? NO! If you thought Minions was bad, then look no further than Despicable Me 3 that atleast fixed the overall franchise for me after that garbage spin-off.I found the film to be the true sequel to the first one, for real! Part 2 was just a simple rehashing focusing on an adventure set in a shopping centre, but still about the same. Minions was just so full of garbage that many of you guys couldn't even stand, along with me. But part 3 was a surprise action blast! With parts 1 and 3 including maybe the most action out of these films, they become many times watchable than part 2 and the garbage Minions spin-off.Speaking about the overall tone of the film, it was very good. You surely need to check out this one and remove everything negative out of your mind while watching it.",Despicable Me 3
112,Animated_Antic,A sequel that sadly still lacks the charm of the predecessors.,6,4 July 2017,"I was really hoping ""Despicable Me 3"" was going to be a good movie. My family went to see the third movie as we all enjoyed the first two movies, but didn't like ""Minions"" and hoped it was good. When we left, we were all pretty disappointed. We thought that the movie was not as good as the first two, and just felt slow and tired. It could have had big laughs and in the end, it just made me feel empty. I'll give you the details on why that is.The movie opens with Gru (Steve Carell) and his wife Lucy (Kristen Wiig) being fired from the AVL after failing to capture the top villain, Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker), a former child star whose hit show was cancelled after he went through puberty. Afterwards, Gru finds out that he has a twin brother named Dru (also Carell), he, Lucy and the girls (Margo, Agnes and Edith), fly to meet him. Right off the bat, Gru doesn't like him, until Dru reveals of his fathers past in which he was a top villain. Wanting his and his wife's job back, he secretly decides to steal a diamond back from Bratt while lying behind his brothers back as Dru thinks they're going into villainy. Meanwhile, the Minions decide to revolt against Gru which eventually ends them up behind bars. I think you can figure the rest out from there.The problems with the movie are pretty easy to point out. I can tell after the opening logos that I was not going to be in for a great movie, mainly because the film changed up the formula that the previous two movies had. The first two showed a crime occurring by a secret baddie and we have no idea who did it and why. What they did in this film was clearly show the villain way to early into the movie and show him full on committing a crime. They should have waited maybe ten or even twenty minutes before they introduced him. Oh, and speaking of the villain, he's terrible. He's so weak and pretty annoying compared to Vector from the first movie and El Macho from the second, and probably worse than Scarlet Overkill from ""Minions"" who was also terrible. I also did not like the twin aspect with Dru that they threw in. It also did get annoying and took away moments from the better characters like Lucy and the girls who didn't appear a lot in the movie. The movie does have good moments though. The writers clearly knew that making the Minions the main characters of the last movie was a big mistake and reduced them back to comic reliefs. Also, it has some pretty humorous moments that don't feature the new characters from Lucy and the girls. If the movie had more moments like that, it would be as good as the first two. But sadly, that's not the case.""Despicable Me 3"" really was not a worthy sequel. I did like it, though not a lot as the first two movies. It was pretty pointless. Illumination, I think you need to move on from ""Despicable Me"" and the Minions now and make more original content like ""Sing"". You really impressed me with that film, now I want to see some more new creative content from you.",Despicable Me 3

114,eparazak,"Is third time's the charm with the Despicable Me franchise? Ehh, somewhat.",7,7 July 2017,"Despicable Me 3 is the latest installment of the Despicable Me franchise. After letting supervillain Balthazar Bratt escape from Gru and Lucy's clutches, they end up getting fired from the Anti- Villain League. The very next day, Gru finds out that he has a twin brother named Dru, so he and his family visits him. While there, Gru must make a choice to return to his old ways as a villain or live a normal life,I went in with an open mind today when I went to see the movie knowing that it has gotten mixed reaction from critics. Leaving it, I gotta say that it's a decent movie. It's not as good of an installment as its predecessors, but it is better than Minions.The movie shares a similar style to Despicable Me 1 and 2 with its more character driven stories rather than, well, story driven stories. As such, they brought on two new ones, Bratt, the antagonist of the film and Dru, Gru's twin brother. Bratt is a very entertaining antagonist, as his actions are guided by his backstory. I don't want to get too in-depth with this guy as it leads into spoiler territory, but all I have to say is that his backstory makes him a very interesting villain.As for the Minions, all but two are absent for the majority of the movie. Whether you like them or not, that fact may motivate or drive you away from watching it. I, for one, was fairly entertained by them, as they were part of one of my favorite scenes in the movie. It's the scene where the Minions basically take over an entire prison, and it's hilarious to see everyone else get overshadowed and scared by them.As for the story, it's not necessarily anything special. At many points, the movie feels distracted. Alongside the plot where Gru meets and connects with his twin brother, Dru, the movie has quite a few sideplots surrounding the movie and none of them seem to connect with the main story, which can be heartfelt and interesting to watch. Honestly, it's kind of hard to say anything new about the plot for the movie when its formula is identical to that of its predecessors. And yes, Gru is still very likable.My main complaint with the movie, however, has to be Dru. As the movie went on, he just felt more like a motivation to Gru rather than a main character. If you think about it, he hardly does anything until the very end of the movie. The only really use that he seems to play is that he has some really cool gadgets and cars. Other than that, he's a very over-the-top character, and not in a really good way. His voice and attitude manage to get on my nerves as he often comes off as loud with his high voice and annoying because of his over-the-top nature, which makes him that less useful.Even if the story is rather so-so and that Dru manages to be pretty useless on his own, Despicable me 3 is entertaining in its own right. It's definitely not the franchise's best, but I think that many would be able to enjoy the movie and its quirkiness.7/10",Despicable Me 3

So why let a cast of yellow criminals define our whole pop culture? The people behind Despicable Me 3 are not even secretive about their agenda: one of their recent tweets read, ""It feels so good to be bad. #DespicableMe3 #Minions"" - @DM_MinionsThe countless obnoxious jokes in this feature well surpass PG-rated acceptability, as the writers continue to victimize women and give men a bad name. The opening logos alone feature two consecutive fart gags. Then Gru, Lucy, and his minions set off to fight their foe on a US Marine ship, only to end with the fat fleshy penguin passing by an office birthday party window in his *ahem* birthday suit. Meanwhile, the Minions land in the middle of a beach where an attractive bikini girl bends down as we look up at her, pressed cleavage framed accordingly. Of course, it sets the Minions into a wild beach party for some reason.These giggly yellow tic-tacs never grasped my interest, in fact it wasn't until last month when I watched the Despicable Me movies for the first time. Well, guess what? Now I have a good reason to hate these golden parasites: these disgusting role models make breaking the law look lovable. While co-director Pierre Coffin still puts in the appropriate contagious voice for these deformed egg yolks, the strength of his performance brings no humor into the poorly staged gags. For instance, after Gru loses his job, these one-eyed laxative pills quit. It leads the live pancreases into a long, pointless subplot that stretches from American Idol rip-off (named ""Sing"" of course), to a hip little prison. After two movies and one spin off, I refuse to believe that none of these oddly shaped humans think twice about these lemon jelly beans wandering about. In truth, these ugly bananas could have been funnier if they had actual human emotions instead of just meeting the comedy's demands.Nobody else here, especially the female characters, contributes any value either. The oldest of the three girls, Margo, does continue her boy issues, but her forced attempt to court a Mexican boy just segues into a usual lazy stereotype. The youngest of the girls, Agnes, continues to bring out the franchise's soul with her adorable search for a unicorn, which in the end does nothing except give the most forced moral that ever forced around the morals. Gru's wife, Lucy, learns the ways of a good disciplined mother, which like Margo's subplot, just turns into hateful stereotyping towards an aggressive Mexican woman with facial hair. So no good family morals here!Although, the parents may smile a bit from the nostalgic 1980's callbacks: expanding bubblegum, musical hits on a cassette tape, Michael Jackson, Jazzercising, toy robots, Rubik's cubes, a bloated Donald Trump doppelganger, and those flashy MTV colors! It certainly resembles what you remembered from your childhood, but here is the catch: it all comes from the antagonist.Yeah, sorry: the nostalgia only exists to subliminally teach kids to see you as destroying their Generation Y imaginations. The whole climax represents that concept as the bad guy's giant robot toy terrorizes Hollywood's major landmarks. It ends with a dance battle between the embodiment of the parents' childhood and Gru, the embodiment of the present-day childhood. Clearly, the blame on the movies' destruction lands on the parents' nostalgia, and Generation Y must rebel against it!Between all the colorless merchandising that we can never escape from as stemmed by this franchise, it's important to know exactly why we refuse to escape. From my experience, the Minions embody our current outlook on violence:-The yellow color represents positive feelings, the round pill shape suggests balance -The blue overalls represents working without too much responsibility -The gibberish language mixed with other world languages represents the Americanized melting pot -The alternating between having one or two eyes represents how some people are one sided and others can look at both sides -Their nearly identical appearances represents how we each represent them in some way or another.So in conclusion: Despicable Me 3 and its predecessors teach us all, kids and adults, that America sets worldwide humanity in balance through crime. I say different. Today's kids must learn not to feed their greed, and Illumination Entertainment is not helping.",Despicable Me 3
117,Clank_Zoka,"Not as Smart or Original Like the First Movie, But It Still Has Fun With What It's Got",8,1 July 2017,"Unlike most people nowadays where they are sick and tired of these movies especially the Minions, I loved the first Despicable Me when It came out, It has somewhat dated animation and you've seen this sort of story before, but It felt refreshing, smart, funny and at times emotional, the two-time Oscar nominated Despicable Me 2 was not as fantastic as the first but It did Improve as a sequel, had a well crafted plot, well developed characters, It was Interesting and the Minions were still going as always, the Minions movie again not as good as the first movie but was more fun then the sequel for reasons that people may disagree, critics and audiences were mixed about It I generally liked, the choice of music, the characters, the jokes and references were really funny and It was a good prequel to the first movie and yes I did like a little more then Despicable Me 2 but I still liked that too.Now when I heard they will be releasing the third movie this year and I saw the trailer last year, I was really excited to see how they will Improve the franchise even more with better clever writing and characters, even the second trailer looked like It It will still have the family element that the first movie had, after that avoided all the trailers Inlcuding TV spots because If there's something I learned from Smurfs: the Lost Village Is that, the more you show, the more It's gives too much away.So I went and saw It today still really excited and....It was great, It has a Interesting plot, It got some new characters that are pretty Interesting and funny Including Balthazar Bratt voiced by Co-creator of South Park Trey Parker, all the recurring characters are all still good as they are, well most of them.However again, not as fantastic as the first movie, slightly better then the second but on par with Minions, Because there are a couple of things that this movie got a bit of downgrade from, the writing while executed fine, It has far too much going, Gru and his twin brother Dru (both voiced by Steve Carrel) are bonding, the Minions end up In prison, Lucy (voiced by Kristen Wiig) trying to be a better Mum for the girls, Margo, Edith and Agnes, Balthazar Bratt sitting around In his lair and Agnes and Edith try and find a Unicorn.With too much going on, there Is no real plot to this, the most Is Gru meeting his twin brother and trying to stop Balthazar Bratt, It could of been like Toy Story 2 where they only focused on two while a couple slipped but they were kind of short towards, but these drag on although Lucy's sub-plot finishes very quickly and finally the other thing and people will be split with me Is that the Minions were somewhat misleading, In the first two trailers they were just the supporting characters, but In the film and the advertising they are In prison, they are In It for good like 10+ minutes, but they are everywhere In the advertising, sure they are iconic and are mascots for Illumination but they are not In the film often like the other movies, I don't know I just like when the Minions show up they can bring me a good laugh they do here but not as much as before.So as you can tell I'm a bit mixed, the writing Is all over the place and the Minions are not In as much, but It does have okay execution, still great animation, the new and old characters are fun and It was still funny, as a long time Despicable Me fan, this Is not the best In the franchise, but not the weak thus far.I'm giving Despicable Me 3 a 8/10.",Despicable Me 3

It surprises me that the audiences find this to be the worst in the series, this is not necessarily a good movie, but for me is the most watchable out of the three.
The twin brother thing is quite funny, is wasted potential, but for this kind of movie works. It reminded me of the '88 film Twins, if some movie accomplishes that, I have to give it props.

While it's still relatively enjoyable, and the minions' antics are as funny as ever (speaking as a fan of Minions, the movie), it's just to all over the place compared to other animated movies.While still visually gorgeous, the story seems to be doing too much and seems to jump from one plot thread to another without really connecting them or making us care.And another thing: It's incredibly distracting to have Stan Marsh play the villain in the movie. I mean I'm not saying Parker can never play anyone else again, but he really needs to do some actual voice work and change his voice up at least a bit.",Despicable Me 3
121,johnplocar,Too. Much. In. One. Movie. Stop it. Watch the first two.,5,24 September 2017,"For the most part over the years I have enjoyed the ""Despicable Me"" franchise, from the first film in 2010 to the ""Minions"" movie in 2015; I wouldn't call them necessarily great films by any means, even in terms of kids flicks, but they are still pretty cute and sufficiently entertaining in my opinion. ""Despicable Me 3"" however is a bit of a hot mess.Now I'm sure that if you sit any child in front of it then they're going to be just fine and have fun with it, and if you're the kind of parent that is only looking for that then this will do the job. Although I would argue that parents should at least try to find something with a little more effort put into it than this. The film has no focus whatsoever, spreading itself thin with countless subplots that come and go like the wind; as if assuming your kids are all totally A.D.D. and must throw as many things at them as possible in a short amount of time. The humor is also mostly mediocre at best, except a few times I chuckled at the 1980s styled villain Evil Brat, played by Trey Parker, but I'm going to guess that's just because of my soft spot for anything 80s. The minions had one or two moments that I found entertaining, but for the majority of the movie their involvement felt really forced. Like someone in the studio kept writing notes for the screenwriters to make them put in more minions shtick no matter how out of place it is.If someone were to ask me what the movie was actually about, I would have a difficult time trying to explain it. What it's supposed to be about is that Gru discovers he has a long lost twin brother named Dru...because of course...and from there Gru begins to creep back to his old ways of villainy, and in the midst of their reunion they face up against the 80s nostalgic villain Evil Brat in order to retrieve a stolen diamond. But the movie is only SOMETIMES about that. The entire movie has to juggle so many plot lines that most are pointless to have in here and only halt the story entirely. Going from Gru facing up against Evil Brat only to get fired from being a secret agent, Gru and the family going through a financial slump after being fired, Gru bonding with his newly discovered twin Dru, Gru having a disagreement with the minions because they want to be villains again and Gru doesn't even though throughout the whole movie Gru is still doing villainous things but the movie doesn't acknowledge that once, the minions going off doing random things from singing on an ""American Idol"" like television show to winding up in prison, Lucy (Gru's wife) learning to bond with Gru's three daughters and finally be a mother, one of the daughter's accidentally getting engaged to a boy selling cheese...what? Another daughter trying to discover a real life unicorn. Gru and Dru performing a heist to steal the giant diamond from Evil Brat. Evil Brat occasionally popping up every 10-15 minutes or so to be quirky for literally 30 seconds only to cut back to whatever is going on with Gru and the family. Evil Brat building a giant robot in order to destroy Hollywood. All that squeezed into 90 with little laughs to be had.There's simply too much, as if the writers had a lot of ideas they wanted to use for a television show and these were concepts for individual episodes but the studio wanted a film so they crammed it all into one movie to shoot out into theaters. That was a bad idea. Now, I can't say that this is a terrible movie. There are far worse to show your children, and like I said before, it will probably do the job of keeping them preoccupied for an hour and a half since there is so much going on. It's bright and colorful, the animation is top notch. But there are also so many better options to watch, especially if you're a parent trying to find something to watch as a family. Watch the first two ""Despicable Me"" movies or the ""Minions"" since those were cute and did a much better job being at least funny. Or if you want something new that's bright and colorful, check out ""Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie"". That's a decent one for the whole family. ""The Boss Baby"" was actually surprisingly decent and had some heart as well as creativity to it. ""The Lego Batman Movie"" had its moments, not a great movie but I still think its better than ""Despicable Me 3"". Although ""Despicable Me 3"" is admittedly a much better option than something like ""The Emoji Movie"" which was a god awful piece of manufactured garbage which contained no respect for your child's intelligence. At least ""Despicable Me 3"" never felt like it was talking down to kids or trying to sell crap for 90 minutes straight. This was at only a bit lazy is all.",Despicable Me 3

123,Abranth-d,Steve carrel shines again,6,19 July 2019,"Here's my review of DME 3 . Once again for the third time , Steve carrel pulls off Gru perfectly. He also voices gru's twin Dru who came out a bit annoying . The story doesn't have an emotional drive like the first one and it works on all the plus points in the franchise , like the minions and gru's villainy. The problem with the story is that it has many subplots which doesn't lead to anything . like for example , there is a subplot where gru's wife tries to be a good mom , that plot was unnecessary , but they can't abandon the three girls , so the writers somehow squeezed it in. The best arc in this story is when gru pulls of a heist with his brother , its fun to see him back in action , with all the villainy , which was missing in the second movie. Now , the bad guy in this movie is really cool . Imagine Michael Jackson as a super villain with a mush , that's what this guy is. I thought this was going to be a trilogy , but the ending clearly shows a sign for a sequel. In the end , DM3 is a kids movie , so forget all the crap I said about ""plot squeeze"" , its a perfect laughter ride with great characters , well timed one liners and a bunch of adorable minions.",Despicable Me 3
124,GoUSN,What happened?,3,6 July 2017,"The previous installments nicely balanced the over-the-top tricks with the plot, and somehow it was plausible in an imaginary sort of way.But this one? It's as if the writers had the plot then later realized they needed the tricks, and in they went, one by one, arbitrarily, with no real imagination or thought. You can hear the director saying, ""ok, insert a trick here, then there, and there, then there."" With a 90-minute run-time, there were actually five stories going on: the brothers, the unicorn search, the minions' imprisonment, the engagement segment (involving the oldest child, age 12!), and the Brat. Two are eventually irrelevant and unresolved, while the other three meet in the end, but in a forced ""we have to write it this way or the movie has no ending"" sort of way.The premise was interesting - long-lost twin brother wants to resuscitate the family tradition of villainy vs. Gru's new home-bound stability. But the execution was just mediocre, if that. Light laughs, an LOL or two, but that's it.The minions stole the show.",Despicable Me 3

The first entry in the series was greeted with praises from the critics, then it all came to a downwards trend, however with that being said, I personally think that ""Despicable Me 3"" is the best of the series, but deep down I believe I am biased because of the 80's vibe it unrolled unto me.""Despicable Me 3"" focuses on Gru and his re-connection with his long-lost twin brother Dru, both voiced by the same Steve Carell. What I found really appealing to the movie was its villain, in the form of Balthazar Bratt, a former child superstar, who still lives in the decadent 80's. Trey Parker does a terrific job as the voice of Balthazar and you can sense his enjoyment in playing a character obsessed with that decade.The soundtrack is what you would expect, popular songs from the 80's, but the way they are expressed into dance and style by Balthazar will leave you rolling in the aisles.Overall, ""Despicable Me 3"" is a family-fun movie and it may bring you more laughter than the previous ones.",Despicable Me 3

I think the first despicable me movie is quite good, it was funny and had a lot of effort put into it, unfortunately DM3 follows the same formula as the second one, abandoning all semblance of a plot so it can throw what ever jokes it wants at a wall and seeing if it sticks. Spoilers; it rarely sticks
I can't believe I'm saying this but this movie might be even worse than 'minions' and that is an achievement
Lazy, unfunny, annoying and very low brow when it comes to both humour and plot, I recommend you avoid this movie at all costs
I'm giving it a two because Trey Parker as the villain is genuinely entertaining, even though his brand of humour is severely restricted. Also the minions disappear for most of it

He's like this man-child with a mustache and a really weird personality.What really rubbed me the wrong way was the TERRIBLE way this movie tried to jump on the recent trend of 80s nostalgia. The villain dude just plays songs from the 80s while he does stuff and his whole vibe is 80s and it's SO CRINGEY. Like in the fight scene they play some 80s song for 6 seconds and then it ends and then another one starts and the just try to cram as many hits as they can into the movie. Like they're hoping the Gen-X'er dad watching this with his family is gonna go ""Hawhaw! Look, *wife*, it's that song from the 80s that we know! Don't you remember the 80s, lol?"" and the wife will be like ""Ye hawhaw, good times"" and repeat for every song they play in the whole diddly darn movie. It's SO EMBARRASSING.Also the whole prison subplot with the minions I remember just being really out of wack and boring and inappropriate and none of it made sense.I didn't really have a problem with the long-lost brother plot, cuz THAT seems like something on par with the personality of the series. It's goofy and dumb but at least it's not as pandering as the rest of the movie. I wish they would have gone with something more fitting with the other two movies.

134,adam-may-bower,Unnecessary,5,2 June 2018,"'Despicable Me 3' is an unnecessary addition to the once-funny franchise. While the first two were great, Illumination Entertainment really should have stopped their. Alas, when a child's film becomes a commercial success, it is bound to be recycled into multiple following instalments. Sometimes this can work in some franchises, but others it just becomes tiresome. This is one of those franchises. While the humour in the film may still produce many laughs, it really is nothing more but uninspired gags borrowed from every other animated kids movie. It results in a film that is just noisy and overwhelming. The whole premise of having the main character as the villain with ridiculously funny motives, that made the first film so great, is now completely turned upside down and ultimately makes the character of Gru an annoying excuse of a character. The actual villain, Balthazar Bratt, was unlikable which resulted in the film being un-engaging as you don't support either the hero, or the villain. Despite all this negativity, this film still had great visuals and did make me laugh several times. It may be a great film for its target audience, but for the older members of the audience, it is just a noisy and unlikable film that you can't wait to be over.",Despicable Me 3

And when I found out that there was going to be 'Despicable me 3' I was excited because Gru was coming back again to the action and not only the minions. And well, about Despicable me 3:I wouldn't consider it like the worst of the series (the worst is Minions), but I still wouldn't call it the best. It is hilarious and very enjoyable, but there were two things about it that I didn't liked very much: one was that I found it a little bit short, and the other one was the villain Baltazar Bratt. Some of his scenes were a little long at the point that his stupidity was like a pain in the ass.However, the union between Gru and his brother Dru, the minions, Lucy and the daughters of Gru made the movie funny enough for me.

Minions had some amusing moments, but was ultimately let down by the lack of interesting characters and the Minion language.DM3 experiences lows on all fronts. The plot is much thinner than previous installments have been, and as is the case in many trilogies, the third film suffers from trying to do too much. Threads are opened and closed quickly, or dragged out too long, leaving the film to suffer from an imbalance of storytelling.The cleverness and Minion cuteness balance that existed in the first two are as such gone, and while it will still surely keep fans that are of the proper age, the adults who were able to enjoy it before will be stuck with an hour and a half long slog that serves mostly to advance the commercialization of the Minions.Also lost in the move are the girls. Each one had independent characterization, story arcs, and were employed well enough to be adorable and effective before. Not as much now. The sidebar with them and Lucy feels like it goes nowhere, and does nothing to advance the already scatterbrained plot.The series would have been best served to end two installments ago, and clearly continues to exist because of the money Universal can make off the Minions.

Rather than make the movie feel crowded, this gave it a lot of heart, a plethora of amusing moments, and plenty of instances where we almost, maybe, teared up a little bit.Let's be fair, the film isn't THE GREATEST MOVIE YOU'LL EVER SEE, but it is a good 1.5 hour escape from the world. Plus it's got everything that you loved from the previous incarnations: Minions speaking and singing gibberish, Agnes and her adorable obsession with unicorns, and Gru being a basically worthless but lovable villain/anti-villain. At the same time, the movie introduces new dynamics: Lucy isn't as annoying as she was in her first movie and the giddy camaraderie between Gru and Dru is infectious.Essentially. it's a feel-good, summer flick that you can take your kids to in order to get away from the summer heat that will also provide you with a few of your own laughs. Do you have to see it? No. Will it be a waste of your time if you do see it? Also no.Featuring: Balthazar Bratt, the washed-up, has been of a character that serves as a dire warning for child actors and brings along a whole lot of 80s pop culture references that even we're not old enough to fully comprehend thrown in for the mommies and daddies out there.",Despicable Me 3
154,annonymouscritic,Everything good and bad about the series mixed together into an OK movie that wishes it could be as good as the first.,6,2 July 2017,"Even though I hate Illumination, I will say this: Despicable Me 1 and 2 are good movies. The first one was pretty good even though it had some continuity errors and the second one was nothing great but just a bit of fun. Both movies are pretty funny though, and while the movie is funny sometimes (not counting the minions due to 2015 destroying them in my eyes) it just feels like the entire movie was wasted potential. But we all knew it was doomed from the start when they introduced Gru's brother, Dru. Adding new characters on to TV shows and movies basically shows that you're out of ideas and are only making it because you need more cash to fill your ocean of money. The girls are still uninteresting except for Agnes, being cute and charming like in the first two, Gru is still the same as ever, Lucy is still a good character and I'm glad to see they kept the Anti Villains League from the last movie. But there is still a bit of low brow humour like the Minions making fun of a statue of Gru because of the boobs on it (although that one did make all the adults that were in the cinema with me laugh out loud and I chuckled a bit, but that was it) and there are plenty of moments in the movie that made me scream what the **** in my head just like the last two movies. So in general it's an OK movie but don't expect anything of spectacular quality.",Despicable Me 3
155,joonaslaine,There's always minions,6,15 March 2019,"The film series has the feeling of getting a bit repetitive, but it still shines on time to time. Agnes always gives a laugh or two, Randy Marsh as an 80s teen star villain was a fun addition even though the actual character didn't give that much if you don't count the greatest 80s hit songs and shoulderpads. The series also has the ice age -theme of minions being more interesting than the actual plot. Series still gives entertainment but when looking despicable me 3 as an individual movie, it isn't that good. Given the strong hint of movie number 4 (5 if you count minions) at the end, I would be more than happy for it being the last one, if the main plot keeps being the same as the first three have been. Nice voice acting, nice jokes even for older audience, but the entirety does not give enough for me.",Despicable Me 3
156,obiegimmie,'Despicable Me 3' Review,5,13 July 2017,"'Despicable Me 3,' is, in summary, a fine but not amazing film that fails to match the wit of the first. 'Despicable Me,' was released in July of 2010. Developed by writer Sergio Pablos (an animator that worked on numerous Disney films such as 'Tarzan') it was originally titled 'Evil Me.' The film was supported by an ingenious marketing campaign, including the release of a Best Buy app exclusively created to translate the Minion language during the film. It was predictably, an immediate hit with parents and children alike for its relatively clever humor, likable lead, and of course, the infamous minions. Its sequel, released 2013 of July, encouraged even more enthusiastic marketing, such as a blimp coined 'Despicablimp' which toured for six months in North America. Now an international sensation with a significant following, 'Despicable Me's minions earned their collectively loathed and demonized spin-off, 'Minions.' Although beloved by younger demographics, it was almost universally hated because of its bloated exterior mixed with an empty emotional core. 2017, the year of half-hearted sequels ('Cars 3,' 'Pirates 5,' Transformers 5...) is about to welcome a new member, the third 'Despicable Me.'BENEFITSThe animation is very stylistic and unique. Rather than aim for realism, such as other animation companies, Illumination goes for its own ridiculous, yet creative CGI technique(s).The villain, Bathazar Bratt (Trey Parker) is amazingly campy and simultaneously enjoyable. A failed 80's TV star, Bratt's obsession (the show he starred in as a kid) is shown several times. You, along with the animators, can delight in the cheesiness of these flashbacks, that echo very similar sentiments to the American 1980's. DETRACTIONSThe film is trying to get too much done. There is a subplot involving Agnes (Nev Scharrel) and Edith (Dana Gaier) trying to find a real unicorn. Lucy (Kristen Wiig) isn't fitting into her new surrogate mother role. The now unemployed minions have hilarious antics to show. Seriously, they are hilarious. In the midst of all this, you remember that Gru (Steve Carell) has a brother, and that they're trying to retrieve a stolen diamond from Bratt (the seemingly main conflict of the film). There is not much to say about this film. Essentially, you get what you (hopefully) paid for; a ridiculous kid's romp that isn't great, or even good, but colorful enough to occupy your 6 year old niece's attention as you use your phone. 6/1060% (fresh)D+",Despicable Me 3
157,tonyum,An okay 3rd instolment,6,8 January 2018,"Hello everyone, now I first thought of not giving this a review, but since I got more interested, I decided to do this so here we go!
Now if you want to know my thoughts on the other Despicable Me films, well, the first film was okay, it had pretty terrible animation, but it had a lot of both funny and emotional moments, the second was also decent, while it had some pretty dark moments, it had a much better animation and it was also funny, and as for this one, it´s also okay but that´ll be explained later, as for now, we´re going to dive into the plot.
The plot is about this villian called Baltazar Brat has stolen a rare diamond, Gru & Lucy try to stop him but they fail and so they get fired, a day later, Gru gets a call from his twin brother Dru who wants to impresse his father by being evil, so they decide to stop Brat from rulling the world, while this is going on, Lucy tries to be a mother to the girls, however she ends up getting Margo a boyfriend and Agnes finding a unicorn, and that´s pretty much the only way I can describe the story.
The pros
1. It has a pretty good animation, sure people can find it bright and way to colorfull, but since this was done by Illumination, you could´ve expect this type of animation, not only that but the models are pleasent and the animation is smooth.
2. The humor is pretty funny and has a tone that does a good job at being like the first two movies.
3. It has emotional and sad moments packed with character arc that once again, does a good job of resembling the other movies.
The cons.
1. It has alot of subplots like: Gru wants to take down Baltazar Brat, Gru meets his twin brother, Lucy wanting to be a mother to the girls, Margo gets a boyfriend, Agnes wants to find a unicorn, the Minnions end up going to jail and Gru dealing with the decision of weather going back to becoming a villian or not, and belive it or not, these plots do indeed have issues, some will be talked later, but anyway, the ´´Agnes wants a unicorn´´ plot feels pointless because why do we need a plot about an infant wanting to find a unicorn and the Mnnions plot feels like something that would´ve worked better if the Minnions and Gru were arrested. 
2. This movie is incredibly unoriginal, first off, the plot of Gru meeting Dru makes it seem like a Jack and Jill ripoff, Baltazar Brat feels like a ripoff of Vector from the first movie as he literally does the same things as Vector and Margo finding a boyfriend plot just already feels like a ripoff from the second movie, only this time, is much shorter.
In the end, this movie is just okay, not anything great nor anything bad, just okay, would I recomend this film? Well, I think the people who personnaly enjoy a lot of plots with anything new, then they migth enjoy this film.",Despicable Me 3

I didn't see any problems, but the story was just meh. I did really like the villain this time though: Balthazar Bratt (Parker) and his backstory from the 80s.

161,ferdimension,Despicable Me 3 is fun as hell,7,2 July 2017,"¿Is the best movie of Illumination? No ¿Is better than Despicable Me 2 and Minions? Yes. In terms or the writing is not 100% perfect because it can have mistakes like the unnecessary sub plot of Margo or Agnes, and some jokes are not really funny. But the writers Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul really knows who to respect the original movie and the sequel. The characters are still the same, the villain is probably the best of the franchise, the Minions (Even know they don't appear much in the film) still have his funny moments (And even some emotional moments), the music of Pharrell Williams and Heitor Pediera is fine and the animation gets better every movie of Ilumination. So yeah, i'ts a good movie and fun to watch. Not the best for the franchise, but yet, is better than DM2 and the Minions Spin Off. I really enjoy Despicable Me 3. If you are a Illumination fan or a fan for the franchise, you can watch this and enjoy it. If you are tired for the Minions and the franchise, you don't necessary need to watch it.

There is no continuation from the previous installments; the only thing it has in common with its predecessors is that it's equally unfunny and has no substance. I would go as far as to say that Robert Rodriguez's film Sharkboy and Lavagirl, while not a very good movie, had more charm than the film at hand, because Despicable Me 3 had no charm.To be clear, I hold Sharkboy and Lavagirl in high esteem for its sentimental value.",Despicable Me 3

But still this is great! I'm pretty sure, Dru will be next sequel's villain and like Gru he would be good. As I said, Despicable Me expanding their characters and earn money-fame for some blast, spoilers doesn't matter on them. From my aspect, story isn't interesting. There is a Nemo cameo in 03:26 to 03:28, i don't know what it indicates or its just for entertainment but i felt good. Every villain of Despicable is almost weak but funny. Minions screen presence should have been extended more. Soundtracks and score is pretty good this time even better than any other. Watch it if you like previous ones!",Despicable Me 3

There's very little comedy and the story also doesn't provide us enough content to be engaged. Even the comedy performed by the minions seems stupid and without laughs most of the time.

171,EDGARCITO_04,horrible,3,28 September 2018,I love animated movies but this is just cancer. The brother of Gru is the most annoiyng character of the movie. After the succces of minions (2015) illumination started to overexploited the minions and the bad guy have a stupid reason for his plan. This is worst movie of the despicable me franchise and definitely one of the worst animated movies I ever seen.,Despicable Me 3
172,jens-andree,A perhaps sad ending (?) to one of the best cartoon sagas out there...,5,28 September 2017,"Another Despicable Me instalment means a load of popcorn for me and the kids - and days of laughter!!! Normally that is...We'd already seen the trailer so we knew that Despicable Me 3 involved Gru's estranged twin brother Dru. (I assume everybody knows this so I'm not marking this as a spoiler.) We were also made aware of the new ""super villain"" Balthazar Bratt, an 80's themed crook, in the trailer. In the trailer he sort of made sense in the deranged world of Despicable Me, but not in the movie.I don't know why they chose this script because it's a really poor one. If it is to kill off the franchise then it worked because good it wasn't. Also changing the voice actor for Agnes from Elsie Fisher to Nev Scharrel was a bad move. Nothing bad about Nev, but it was too obvious and the kids reacted instantly. You have to be careful with voice actors because they ""are"" the character and not just a paid actor that can be replaced at short notice. There might've been a reason for this, I don't know, but it was too obvious.Without going into detail about the movie for those who haven't seen it it's the usual stuff with some sort of heist and one super villain - and something going wrong, but with a happy ending. Sadly without any finesse or enthusiasm as the previous instalments.If you love Despicable Me and the Minions movie then watch this one as well - but don't expect it to be as fantastic as the previous ones! They had the chance of doing a movie about the young boy Gru and his adventures with the Minions, following up on the Minions movie, but this fell between the chairs somehow... Me and my kids must've seen the previous movies at least 20 times each! This one we probably won't see again. That says something...A weak 5 out of 10 - sadly.",Despicable Me 3
173,jackosmithy,More throw away material,3,9 October 2017,"I did not have high hopes coming into this movie, yet I am still disappointed with the lack of passion that went into the creative side of this movie.First with the positives of this movie. For me, the idea of the dance fighting I found new and pretty fun. Also the positives of this movie include Steve Carell and the animation, which was done really well. Also the minions character go to unexpectedly dark new heights, which I thought was a risky but worthwhile choice by the writers.Now onto the negatives, and there are a few. First I have to get this out of the way. The character of the wife of Gru is undoubtedly the most annoying character as well as being a very belittling character towards women. This character annoyed me greatly and made the audience feel like idiots. Next is the introduction of the character Dru, which could have gone two ways but did not work and did not add any comedic purpose and seemed just to serve as a massive cliché of two different characters having to work together. But in my opinion the biggest problem with this movie is the incredible lack of jokes that hit throughout the run time. This was a huge fault in my opinion with the screenplay of this movie. For any adults that have to attend this movie I feel sorry for and will most likely take away from the movie experience that we all love. At best this is a fun movie that some kids who will stare at the screen blankly for an hour and a half while the parents consider whether they will be taking their kids to see another movie again.",Despicable Me 3

However, there is saying too much expectations always end in vain. Yes, i am slightly disappointed with third movie. It doesn't have that cuteness and charm what previous movies had. You may ask is that bad? No, not that bad. But definitely, watchable for one time, that, too, for minions. It has some funny moments which was quite good to see and enjoy.I really don't want to talk about the story because there is nothing much to talk about, perhaps, write about. Villain character Balthazar Bratt is quite boring and dumb. At beginning, he looked like cool Villain and after movie progresses, damn, another cheesy and dumbest boring villain character in the world of animation. Sometimes, his repeated gimmicks irritated me lot. The biggest problem is there was no proper character developments what we had seen in previous two movies. It was totally empty. And another important thing is, less emotional content. And it lacks humor too.Overall, If you are die hard fan of the franchise and adore over load cuteness of minions, then go for it. Otherwise, do not have any expectations. After watching Despicable Me 3, you will feel empty and nothing memorable from the movie apart from cute minions.

181,uzitha,Entertaining! Funny! and Adorable! They've done it again!,8,25 June 2017,"When the first trailer of the third installment of the popular franchise surfaced on YouTube, I was quite amused but skeptical at the same time. I loved the previous two movies, but the 2015 Minions movie fell very short of my expectations where the jokes seemed overdone and I kept glancing at the time hoping it would end. I went to the cinema not knowing what to expect, because despite my doubts, at least rotten tomatoes had given it a good rating. From the first scene itself to the last, this movie had me laughing throughout. The jokes were slapstick most of the time, there was no real depth to it, but was there ever? Nevertheless it was good. I instantly loved the villain, the man wearing shoulder pants! While not as entertaining as vector from the first movie, this 80's villain Balthazar Bratth held up as a worthy successor. The minion bits were good, as long as it's not a continuous two hours of the yellow bastards running around and making trouble, they are a treat to watch. The next highlight of the movie was Dru, Gru's twin brother. And not bad at all, Steve Carell manages to do a higher pitch version of the same voice and accent he used with Gru and he nails it. The character blend effortlessly into movie.The third movie follows the same formula as the first two, the super villain causes big trouble kidnapping someone close to Gru while making things go boom boom! While Gru and the family come to the rescue. However unlike most movie trilogies, where the jokes get old and we feel they should just stop *cough cough transformer cough cough* Despicable me 3 manages to keep her charm and deliver a very entertaining movie.

183,nonslipshoes,Better than the Minions.,7,11 April 2018,"Despicable Me 3 is the third movie in the Despicable Me series. After the absolutely atrocious Minions movie, it made me wonder if this movie could stack up. And it's pretty good. Nothing that special, just...pretty good. It's not terrible in all means, but one of the movies main flaws is that it fails to explain key questions a viewer may have. For instance, it's never explained why Clyde is an actual robot if he was only intended for a show, and it doesn't explain how Dru knows all the girls names. The movie is split into one main plot focusing on Gru, Dru and Balthasar Brat (BB). The second is the Minions running away from Gru due to him not taking up villainy after being fired from his job. The third involves Lucy and the girls, where Lucy is trying to become a good mother. I liked the mother side plot and the main plot but the Minions plot seemed unneeded and only there for laughs, as all it leads to is them popping a giant bubble gum bubble. The movies presentation is fantastic, although it's strange how the lively city holding a festival suddenly goes quiet as Dru steals a lollipop. The plot is overall good. It's a movie where you can watch it without dieing inside. Worth a watch if there's people with you, but not so much on your own.",Despicable Me 3

Maybe if it was his Dad instead of a brother? Anyways, after watching this a few times, I'm starting to realize that things just don't add up for various scenes. Where Dru lives, Fredonia, they seem to be known for their pig farms which is a weird concept in general, and then the girls go to a cheese festival in town for a bonding experience. The thing that doesn't add up is that we don't have pig cheese, it's not a thing. I work in a cheese department in a large grocery store and we have cow's, sheep's and goat's milk cheese but no pig milk cheese. Pig's are very difficult to milk so this cheese festival - where did all the milk come from? To make the statement of their cheese obsession even grander is when you see a guy dunking his brie into his coffee when Dru and Gru are running away from the police. Next confusing bit is when they arrive to the festival and Lucy asks the butler what is going, which he answers, but when Lucy tries to distract the girls from the Tipsy Unicorn, she suddenly knows about the traditional dance that's happening.

The whole ""brother"" concept is good, but it shouldn't have been set up in this movie. It should have been set up in the first one, or the end of the second at the latest.2. This problem I refer to as ""the politics of film,"" because the studio did not acknowledge that they are going to far with this series. The minions stole the show in the first one, however the studio kept pushing it on audiences by over-commercializing them. They somehow became the face of Illumination Studios, and they somehow managed to get their own unnecessary origin story movie. Universal should've stopped while they were ahead with the first Despicable Me. 3. I do not like it when a series will reuse jokes, in this case the ""unicorn being so fluffy I'm going to die."" It was funny in the first one, but in this one it felt forced.4. The villain, Balthazar Bratt, felt way too underdeveloped. He got about four minutes of an origin, which resulted in vague motivations and just another generic, one-off villain.Overall: Save yourself from this mess",Despicable Me 3
188,dmdryanminecraft-60907,Who asked for this movie?! Show yourself!,6,22 July 2017,"If this was a premiere for Season 1 of the Despicable Me TV show, I would love it, because it feels more like a TV show than a movie. In any case, it's not a premiere for a TV show. It just feels like it. The minions had awesome moments in this movie, but they weren't the whole movie. The humor the minions had in this movie was the kind of humor we deserved from the Minions movie. They were obviously the stand-out of the film. Gru, on the other hand, was... er... not good. Gru never made me laugh and he felt like a secondary character. Dru was much better in every way. The point where Dru wanted the diamond but Gru wanted his job back just made me groan. It felt awkward, forced, and overall just not emotionally grasping. One second Dru was angry at Gru and they were yelling at each other, and the next second Gru just decides to forgive him for no reason whatsoever and Dru joins him without a second thought. It would be a 5/10, but since it was the 3rd movie in a trilogy I kind of signed up for this. Despicable Me was obviously better than this movie because it was actually heartwarming and clever, Despicable Me 2 was better than this but not quite as good as the first one, this movie, and then that Minions movie. And then... *sigh*... there's Minions 2 in 2020. Can't wait to review that... I'm thinking a 5/10? Maybe if it cuts back on boring characters and focuses more on that family that picked the minions up it would sneak by with a 6/10.",Despicable Me 3
189,hitman-15080,The worst Despicable me by far,1,4 August 2017,"This movie was awful. I enjoyed the first two but this one was a disaster. I felt sorry for the time I wasted watching it and the money I paid for the movie theater. Most of the movie is about Gru, his wife, and 3 daughters. The minions have very little scenes in the movie. Which means we're missing the part which we all go see this movie for !! The story was boring; this movie at best is for kids up to 10 years old.",Despicable Me 3

191,jackrr-719-344698,Unnecessary but not Unwelcome,5,29 June 2017,"I liked the first Despicable Me and enjoyed Despicable Me 2 even more. Minions showed that some supporting characters really shouldn't get their own spin off movie but they're still going to make a Minions 2. Yay for that. Going into Despicable Me 3 I had some hope it would be more like the first two movies and less like the Minions spin off. In my opinion it was somewhere in the middle.The animation looks acceptable but Illimination's animation artists still haven't been able to keep up with the talents of Disney Pixar. However, the backgrounds in some scenes were really vibrant with a European backdrop.The story was rather scattered. You couldn't tell if it was more about Gru and Balthazar Bratt or Gru and Dru. As well as those plots we also had Lucy trying to become a good mother, Agnes trying to find a unicorn and the minions escaping prison. The voice acting was good as always by Steve Carrell who got to voice not only Gru but now Dru. Trey Parker got to show off his voice acting skills as the villain of the film and the new kid voice actors did fine replacing their characters predecessors. Everyone else was fine.The minions who I used to find hilarious are just getting on my nerves now. I honestly feel like their scenes were just written in for marketing such as when they are in prison or when they go on a singing show. I mean, the majority of the posters I've seen are minions with tattoo's and in black and white jail uniforms.It appears that this set up a Despicable Me 4 which at this point I hope they don't do. I can't say I hated the movie. It's just a good movie to pass the time. It's still better than Minions.",Despicable Me 3

Out of nowhere... Lame, lame, lame, lame... LAME!! And what's more lame than an identical twin out of nowhere? A villian that is pointless and not really a villian. I mean like at at all. They should have stopped at two. Now if you're going to have the twin out of nowhere, at least make Him the villian. At least you have something worth fighting for. Saving the twin. Not saving the twin. Making a 4th to maybe save the twin and have him come over to your side? The possibilities are endless. But this? This is a load of tripe and all of this comes from my 8 year old nephew who absolutely loves the the first two movies. And I wholeheartedly agree.",Despicable Me 3
193,metafser,Despicable Me 3 is the worst creation by illumination. No best part in the movie. But worst part everywhere except the smooth character design.,3,29 June 2017,I am a huge fan of Minions. That's why every time I love to spend money for watching the movie in #1 Cineplex in Bangladesh. No doubt that the Despicable Me 3 was the most expected movie in 2017. But maybe I spent the worst 1 hours 30 minutes. As well as my money. The first one and second one was a quite good story. But the third one just like as usual story. I mean a kid can write a better story than the Despicable Me 3 writer. Illumination fails to use those character properly. I just put 3 stars because of the smooth character design. Even though the 3D version looks like regular. No difference. I didn't find anything to laugh. Every time I feel illumination is trying to force me to laugh.,Despicable Me 3

The villain himself, is kinda bad, meaning with his equipment etc. it's really ridiculous, but the villain is funny with his break dance moves and how he's still stuck in the eighties and how he thinks that everyone loved his show and he didn't understand why it was cancelled, but he just confirms it why it was cancelled, if you saw the movie, you know what I mean. In the end, I really enjoyed watching the movie and how Gru's turning back to be a villain again. One thing what they could of done better is, to explain more why the former CEO of the AVL resigned why the new CEO came. I know, it's important for the story plot, but it just came like this: ""I'm resigning and that's your new CEO"". They could of done that better.",Despicable Me 3

What I mean by that is well they have jobs (and get fired) than the evil guy kidnaps the girls at the end of the movie but they almost immediately get them back and okey. The movie has no plot twist/s it's just small stories tied together to make a movie, with a bad guy who started as a baby actor (he acted a bad guy) and then just decided let's make that a reality, so he spends awful a lot of money to make a ""super fun bad guy base"" WHAT! Excuse me do you not know how to bad guy, you don't need to mass produce bubble gum and dance like an idiot every time you rob something (I say something but really he only tries to steal a gem/diamond with no luck) and then somehow has money to build a huge mecha (it's a big robot you are inside of and control it).Also why do you need to take everyone out of their clothes... you pervert",Despicable Me 3

You can have something different, probably not better. I am more into Lynch, Cronenberg, Fincher, etc. and I am not used to this kind of cinema.

In fact I wouldn't mind seeing a spin off or continuation of Balthazar Bratt. Even though my kids don't get the 80s references in the slightest way, they have found everything about this villain (music, costumes, weapons, and dance fighting) very entertaining.I'll be interested to see where they go with this franchise with the addition of Gru's brother and the change from Villain to hero but they managed to pull it off in this movie so I'm sure they'll find a way. This is probably my favorite movie out of the Despicable Me movie set, followed by 1 and then 2.
Maybe I'm easily entertained or maybe the critics are too critical. I'm leaning more towards the latter since Ive found most critic's reviews to be off, at least for my taste. Also, I think kids movies reviews should also be based more on the entertainment factor kids get from it.",Despicable Me 3
206,clark_gillies,"Its OK, but worst of the series",5,17 July 2017,"Took my daughter to see this movie at the weekend.My expectation were not high, as I found Minions so-so (first 2/3's were entertaining, but final act dragged on) and Despicable Me 3 was pretty much the same.Gru and Lucy find themselves fired after they failed to take in 1980's TV-star, turned super villain, Balthazar Bratt (voiced by one of the guys from South Park/Team America, and took me a while to put my finger on why I knew his voice so well).... after which Gru discovers he has a twin brother called Dru, who is a wannabe super villain like Gru, and Gru tricks into a plan to get Balthazar Bratt.All the while Lucy is finding it hard to mother-life.First thing that you will notice about this movie is just how short it is..... felt like we had just sat down and the movie had gathered pace, then suddenly we are into the final big fight.Also, the Minions are hardly in it.... in promotion a big deal was made on Minion Mel, yet he hardly did anything (the two big musical bits of the movie just seemed so forced to give the Minions something to do).While slightly more entertaining that the first movie, not as good as the second or the first 2/3's of Minions, but like Minions, it runs out of steam very fast and just plods along to much to keep you hooked.Also they seem to introduce a lot of characters in the movie who do nothing that offers anything (Gru and Lucy new boss at the start of the movie probably has 2 scenes, and neither offered anything that did anything for the movie).Also Agnes really does lose her cute-ness factor and borders on annoying in this (couple of awwwww moments, but most the time just offers nothing that we have not seen in the previous 2 movies).Not a good movie to end on, but they really need to buck up their idea's for future movies (having Gru and Lucy get married in the previous movie clearly backed them into a corner where they were limited with what they could do).",Despicable Me 3

209,trevor_b-39625,I @*%$ing loved it!,9,8 July 2017,"Where to begin? There is so much to say about the new addition to the Despicable Me franchise. Lets start with the voice talent. Despicable Me 3 saw the return of Steve Carell to the role of Felonious Gru (or Gru for short), but also using his talent for voice acting to create a unique voice for the new character of Dru, Gru's twin brother. Also Kristen Wiig returning her role of Lucy Wilde, Gru's wife and work partner until they are fired by Valerie Da Vinci, voiced by Jenny Slate. This is a good time to mention that I am a huge Jenny Slate fan and I was a over the moon when I found she was in one of my favorite movie franchises even if she had very little screen time. Talking of new arrivals, Trey Parker absolutely crushed the part of the antagonist, Balthazar Bratt. Bratt himself is a complex character. His backstory is slightly rushed but you get the idea. Bratt was a child actor in Hollywood famous as ""Evil Bratt"", a child super villain obsessed with world denomination, but once he hit puberty the show was axed and Bratt became obsessed with the character he once played. Bratt also gained a deep hatred for Hollywood. Bratt also has a hatred for Gru which isn't truly explained but it causes him to kidnap the girls and nearly kill Gru with a high powered laser. My favorite thing to do in movies is look for hidden references a one was so in-your-face that I don't think you can even call it an Easter egg. At one point the minions chase a pizza delivery man to a theater in which a singing competition is taking place and they end up on the stage. Not enough, the competition was called ""Sing"". I'm not sure if this a coincidence or of this is a nod to the 2016 movie ""Sing!"", also by Illumination Entertainment. Highly recommended movie for all the family.

Having one villain dance to 'Physical' against a pole, and on a exercise ball, wasn't really that appropriate. And with Gru's twin, it was played homage to the low level of entertainment that 'Jack n Jill' brought about, except being animated. Gru and Dru didn't properly embrace for a normal hug once, it was always just out of control strangling each other around the waist? And why would you have two twin brothers, in their underwear, lying down by each other, on a beach in the evening? Just an example of how appropriation for gender, and sexual curiosity has been encouraged for children's film, and in their everyday lives.

218,potenzasantiago,Oh god...,3,25 July 2017,"Being honest is one of the biggest crap I've seen in the last 5 years, but first I'll talk about the only good thing the movie had.This ""thing"" has very good music, either in the Bratt scenes or in the absolute stuffing (but I'll talk about that), I really mean the style of the 80s and the atmosphere that creates the movie related to this is pretty well done, Now, to burn this ""thing"".The first thing is that the film is not funny, many say the first 2 movies are very funny and if it is true but this third installment has 2 factors when applying your mood.1-Eschatological humor (For example: Of gases) 2-Highlighting all the bad and evil that come to GruAlmost all the scenes of the film seem that they are an excuse to make Gru like miserable person.This movie has no conflict, at first sounds quite original with the part of the TV series ""EvilBratt"" but then we get that Gru has a twin brother who is forced to give some support to the movie, That Dru discovers this secret, I wonder.How did you find out? At no time in the first 2 films are we shown to a close family member, not even to his mother, who knows of the existence of Dru.How is this possible? Thanks to THE ARGUMENTAL HOLES OF A MEDIOCRE WRITER, YAYYYY!And here are other things in which the movie fails miserably.-Is very boring -Repetitive -One of the worst villains in the trilogy -The performances of the voices of the characters STINKS, well, it is more I spell it to you S-T-I-N-K-S!The only thing that is saved is the animation that has a large color palette and looks nice and bright but in the rest, it is very meh.Conclusion: A TRASH without remedy :)",Despicable Me 3

In the Minions movie it's the other way around with Minions being the star(s). But one thing in common of those three movies is that the stories are complete-no lingering questions. All the characters, even just contributed a small part of the story and subsequently disappeared, will re-emerge in the end that explains what happened to them-closing the story. As in the example of ""Finding Dory"" when a school of aquarium fish escape from the dentist office in a plastic bag, there will be many wondering ""how do they escape from the plastic bag?"" the question was addressed by the creative team with a post-credit scene.None of the consideration is demonstrated here, at least in addressing potential questions audience might have. Story feels like several fragmented pieces got stitched together, doesn't flow naturally. Also a good portion of characters behave ""bad-ass"" like, even minions! Feels like the creative team of this movie have a lower level of passion and love toward these characters than before. They don't care as much that there's a minion left behind...",Despicable Me 3

225,jackwolf-77755,The series keeps getting worse. (Spoilers),3,6 April 2018,"The first movie in the series was alright. I'd probably give it a six out of ten. It's not exactly bad, but it's not even close to good either. Second movie started to take risks with dumb ideas that ultimately flopped. Probably a five. That brings us here, to the third installment, which I'd give a three. It could work if done better, but it fails on several accounts. It could probably be worse, but it'd take some effort. The first problem that shows up is the antagonist. He's not right for a few reasons. A Hollywood actor who lost his series when puberty hit. The first problem is, if the series was popular enough, they'd make a sequel series that works with this. Then we cut to him now, and he's a rich super genius who's got technology years ahead of the time, an inconsistent trait through the entire series where the important characters were trying to make profits through criminal means when they had more advanced technology than anyone else that they could patent and sell. We also hear his phrase, taken from his show to be used for laughs, but coming from a grown man, ""I've been a bad boy"" comes off as creepy and, to some, maybe even lewd for a kids' movie. From here we go on with a generic scene. It's not good, it's not bad, but kids will enjoy it. Then we get to my least favorite type of humor, awkward humor, except it's worse now because Gru is completely naked, hanging by bubble gum, floating in front of a window and trying to lighten the mood. This comes off as nothing but awkward. We then continue on to see our first plot point. Gru and the girl, whose' name I forgot because the characters are bland, get fired by a new owner to the criminal organization despite coming closer than anyone else to saving the the item being stolen. This could be done for some interesting things, but all it does is provide a hollow justification for a moral shift later on that, ultimately, isn't even the cause of the shift. It then goes on to Gru trying to survive without a job even though he has the before mentioned tech, and recieves a letter to meet his brother, Dru. Upon asking his mother about this, we find out that she was cruel to Gru to try and stop him from becoming a villain. The problem with this is that this is a lie, she was just cruel and put him down, there was nothing evil about child Gru. Then we meet Dru, which is a terrible reskin of Gru that doesn't come off as an alternate Gru but rather comes off as a gay stereotype. Except there's nothing else homosexual about him, leaving immediate questions as to what the character is. Then we find out that Gru's family has villainy in its lines, which amounts to nothing. At this point the forgettable tangle of pointless plots, like intelligent girl eating some cheese because her mother thought it was a good idea and getting tangled in a ""romance"" she doesn't like and cute girl going off to find a unicorn. At some point we reach an infiltration scene with a Gru-Dru sixty-nine thing that's probably supposed to look like Yin and Yang, but would sail over most kids' heads and disturb most mature viewers. We then get into a generic escape scene with a rip-off of Megamind's flying robots in the form of flying dolls, then reach a defiance of logic as the antagonist flies in and catches them disguised as the wife of Gru, apparently having bound and gagged her, made a disguise of her, and stealing the plane all while Gru and Dru escape over the course of a few minutes. Then we get to the climax where the antagonist has a giant doll robot from his TV days, in which he plans to use the diamond he stole to laser the city and use bubble gum to send it into the air. The motivation behind this is unclear. His robot gets foiled by Gru and Dru after some defiance of the established rules with the bubble gum. The movie ends of with Dru, who the entire time has been wimpy, useless, and unlikable, successfully stealing things from Gru so that he can be the new villain, a plot point which makes no sense at all. Gru was bland as always, I can't remember many of the plot points because they went absolutely nowhere, the rest of the characters were simple, and Dru, the biggest new character, was unlikable and useless the entire time, making us agree with Gru and the hate he spews rather than hoping for some sort of apology scene.",Despicable Me 3
226,niccindal,Writers really ruined this... sorry not sorry,3,11 June 2018,"The 3rd was trying way too hard. They tried to feature the girls more as they should have, BUT it was forced. There is so much bad I could say about this but I am one to offer a solution.. I think this 3rd movie should have featured something from the girls point of view, like Agnes' dance or performing, and tie in a villain going after the dance school somehow or something with their school or summer plans! How fun. Maybe something is buried under their school or their playground at the park, introduce some new kids, maybe Gru adopts one more from the orphanage. To me, this would have been much more creative than saying that Gru had a twin. The first two were centered on Gru, a minions movie, and now this one with Gru having a twin?? NO.

228,zhafirah-02088,Review despicable me3,7,30 January 2019,"I like to watch despicable me3 and now i want to review about despicable me3. i think despicable me3 is good but despicable me1 and 2 is better. because in despicable me3 the minions not funny as despicable me1 and 2. and in despicable me 3 the minions is not shown to much. but there is one thing that make interesting. it is dru, dru is the twin of gru. but the emergen of the twin make forget about the existence of minions because they more focused on gru and dru who wanted to be evil again. at the end of the story, despicable me3, still confusing me because dru bring the minions away. so i think there will be continuation it is despicable me 4",Despicable Me 3
