0,TheLittleSongbird,I thought it was decent,6,25 January 2012,"Elektra is not perfect, the dialogue is corny, the plot is rather slender and tries a little too hard to disguise that with childhood flashbacks and soul-searching complete with a rather pointless sub-plot and while impressively choreographed the final confrontation was somewhat anti-climatic. However, it is a visually stylish movie with great cinematography, fantastic locations cool costumes and fun special effects. I was impressed also with the choreography of the action sequences complete with some very clever stunt work, the surreal atmosphere Elektra created and the brooding soundtrack. There is effort to make the characters interesting, and the acting is decent enough. Jennifer Garner is attractive and does bring weight and charisma to the role, Goran Visjinc is surprisingly natural and Terrence Stamp is good and very commanding. The villains are subtle and have vitality, especially Stone, if underused. I didn't care for Kirsten Prout, too bland and annoying for my tastes. Overall, decent if nothing exceptional. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Elektra
1,Leofwine_draca,Poorly-conceived superhero effort,4,7 July 2016,"This supposed follow-up to DAREDEVIL omits one important component of that previous movie: no Ben Affleck. Instead the focus of the film falls on the rather boring, obsessive life of Elektra, Daredevil's attractive sidekick who actually died on a rooftop in that previous movie. But here she is resurrected from the dead by a blind martial arts master, fighting off various members of criminal gang The Hand who are after a young girl whose skills hold the secret to the future. In many respects, the plot resembles that of recent Jackie Chan flick THE MEDALLION, but incredibly it's even LIGHTER than in that film. Only shadowy clips go towards explaining our lead's decision to become a professional assassin, and of the bad guys, we have no idea of their past, except that an evil-looking Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa (SHOWDOWN IN LITTLE TOYKO) is leading them. Sadly, Tagawa – usually a great and sadistic villain – is relegated to sitting behind a desk in his few appearances here.ELEKTRA – for all its previews as a martial arts extravaganza – is light on action, heavy on plot less character-building. We learn a lot about a bleeding 14 year old girl (as soon as I saw her and her cringe-worthy 'bonding' with Elektra, I knew we were in trouble) but nothing very interesting. When the action comes, it takes jump-cuts and ruthless editing to the next level, resulting clumsy, messy fight sequences where you can't really see what's going on. I really expected more of Rob Bowman, who directed some atmospheric episodes of THE X-FILES a while ago.Jennifer Garner is certainly attractive as Elektra – especially in her red suit – but she has nowhere to go and nothing to do. Even the actress herself reportedly slammed the film. E.R. doctor Goran Visnjic is handsome but empty as the father figure, and disappears about halfway through the movie, whilst the kid Prout is awful. The only other noteworthy is Terence Stamp as a blind master. As a commanding master, he's good; as blind, he's totally unbelievable.The bad guys are built up with special skills – one has stone skin, another has a deadly kiss – but incredibly, they die straight away and prove no match for our heroine whatsoever. The special effects are remarkably good, especially in the shape of one guy's tattoos which frequently come to life, but that can't save the film. Even the promise of a full-on ninja attack come the finale is cruelly destroyed as Elektra blows them up all at the same time (why the hell do they all jump into the same room anyway). The best bit of this slow-moving, long-winded film? Early on, when a ninja breaks his own neck rather than be captured. It's a classic scene in an otherwise uninteresting and poorly-conceived effort.",Elektra
2,SnoopyStyle,Slow moving confused weak production,5,8 September 2013,"Elektra (Jennifer Garner) has become an assassin for hire. She meets a sweet girl Abby Miller (Kirsten Prout) and her father Mark Miller (Goran Visnjic) living next door, but then told that they are actually her next assignment.This is the follow up to Daredevil (2003). I guess it's the first attempt Kevin Feige and friends at Marvel to build various characters together. It failed miserably, but I'm glad that they came back for more. The beginning moves extremely slow. There's all kinds of flashbacks that doesn't illuminate anything. It gets going when the dark organization called the Hand sends in more assassins. But then it gets a bit tiresome. The fights are never that interesting, and always seemed to lack tension. There is some wirework, but it seemed more acrobatic than powerful. It is yet another fail. They had X-Men, Spiderman, Fantastic 4, but they were all individual franchises. It's not until Iron Man (2008) that they reach solid footing for a linked series of superheroes.",Elektra
3,claudio_carvalho,Only A Reasonable Adventure,6,9 July 2005,"I am not familiarized with the comic magazine of Elektra, but I found the character and the story full of contradictions. Indeed I was more impressed with the stunning beauty of Jennifer Garner than with the movie itself. Elektra is an assassin-for-hire, but she is also pure and good, as per the explanation of her mentor Stick (Terence Stamp). While she is protecting her targets, her loyal but also mercenary partner McCabe (Colin Cunningham) sacrifices himself to protect Elektra, Abby (Kirsten Prout) and Mark Miller (Goran Visnjick). In her final battle against Kirigi (Will Yun Lee), first she explodes the stove in the kitchen, but there is no damage in the rest of the house with the huge explosion; then she saves Abby, puts her in the bed and turns on the lamp on the night table. Therefore, it is an abandoned house with power and gas. The special effects are good, and in the end Elektra is only a reasonable adventure, fortunately not as bad as the Cat Woman. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Elektra""",Elektra
4,classicsoncall,"""So, you, um..., you really kill people for a living?""",7,21 November 2020,"This film was released about six months after The DC Comics based movie came out for ""Catwoman"". With a 4.7 IMDb viewer rating as I write this, it comes in a tad better than it's counterpart at a 3.4. I didn't think either one was all that bad, but I can see how folks would pan them both critically against your better comic book, super-hero flicks. The story line telegraphs where it's going in a big way shortly after we're introduced to Mark Miller (Goran Visnjic) and his daughter Abby (Kirsten Zien). If you couldn't tell they were destined to be the targets on Elektra's latest hit list, you probably haven't seen enough action films. Jennifer Garner makes for a decently capable warrior assassin, although I don't think she would have been my first choice for the role. In the comics, the character is of Greek descent, and Garner appears most wholesomely American. A better fit would have been someone along the lines of say Elodie Yung, who portrays Elektra in the Netfllix series ""Daredevil"". She's doesn't have a Greek background either, but her exotic look makes for a more effectively mysterious looking femme fatale. Either way, you've got an assortment of baddies in this story to go up against the fearsome Elektra. My favorite had to be the Tattoo guy (Chris Ackerman), even with the overkill of all those snakes. The goal of the villains is to take out the young girl Abby, seeing as how her prowess as a martial artist has dubbed her 'The Treasure', and if the dark side couldn't have her, then nobody could. Had this picture been better received, you might have expected a sequel, as the chemistry between the title hero and the thirteen year old seemed pretty good. The box office deemed otherwise.P.S. Just following up on viewer ratings, this picture becomes the one hundredth entry on my IMDb list of Comic Book Super-Heroes I've watched and reviewed. Ranked in IMDb rating order, it comes in at #95, while the aforementioned ""Catwoman"" is dead last.",Elektra
5,jboothmillard,Elektra,4,24 February 2010,"You may remember Daredevil two years before, well, fans of the comic will be happy to see the female character getting her own spin-off film, from director Rob Bowman (Reign of Fire). Basically, after surviving a near death experience, warrior and once student of the power called Kimagure, Elektra (Jennifer Garner) has gone into hiding and become a professional assassin. She does step out of her lonely life to have a dinner with her neighbours Mark Miller (Goran Visnjic) and daughter Abby (Kirsten Prout), and she is shocked to see that they are her next targets. Now on the run from The Hand, they try to escape all trying to kill them, because of daughter Abby being skilled in similar ways to Elektra, and father Mark knowing about it. Elektra, after some advice from her blind and wise martial arts master Stick (Terence Stamp), naturally is determined to protect her new friends, with her skills in knife work and fast instinct. Also starring Licence to Kill's Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Roshi, Die Another Day's Will Yun Lee as Kirigi, Chris Ackerman as Tattoo, Edson T. Ribeiro as Kinkou, Colin Cunningham as McCabe, Hiro Kanagawa as Meizumi, Jason Isaacs as DeMarco, Natassia Malthe as Typhoid and Bob Sapp as Stone. Garner might have her ears sticking out a little bit, but she is attractive in the original red outfit. It is just a shame she and the film doesn't get enough fight sequences, I can see why it has been re-rated two stars, it just isn't a very action-packed martial arts fantasy film. Okay!",Elektra
6,Tweekums,Better than expected,6,10 March 2009,"When I sat down to watch this I was expecting to see a real turkey but ended up being pleasantly surprised; sure it wasn't the Citizen Kane of super hero movies but it wasn't awful either. Jennifer Garner was pretty good in the title role, teenager Kirsten Prout put in a good performance as Abby, the young girl Elektra was trying to protect and Terence Stamp was good in his role as Elektra's mentor.In the opening scene we are introduced to Elektra the unstoppable assassin; a man is protected by a large security force explains to his head of security how a female assassin has been pursuing him but she always lets him go after eliminating his security... not this time however, this time he ends up dead. Having been introduced she gets a new mission, she is told to go to wait on an island where she will be told who her target is. While she waits she meets Abby, a girl who she catches breaking into her house, and her father. She soon befriends then and when she learns that they are in fact the people she is there to kill she can't go through with it, in fact instead of killing them she becomes their protector against further assassination attempts.The group that what to assassinate Abby and her father are known as The Hand and their assassins have distinct super-powers which reminded me of The Brotherhood from the X-Men films. They want him dead because he has something they simple refer to as The Treasure, what it is isn't specified at this point.The action scenes are fairly well done and for the most part our heroine gets to wear normal clothes, although in the final confrontation she ends up in a rather silly looking costume that may have looked good in a comic book but doesn't work a well in a film, it may look sexy on Jennifer Garner but looking sexy isn't going to be ones first priority when expecting a fight. I saw this on television and won't be rushing out to buy the DVD although fans of the genre or Jennifer Garner might want to get it if they see it in the bargain bin.I can't say how true the characters are to those in the comic as I've never read them.",Elektra
7,ma-cortes,A loner assassin faces off supernatural warriors with impressive fights and breathtaking action,6,1 August 2011,"This is a spin-off from ¨Daredevil¨ (2003 by Mark Steven Johnson with Ben Affleck who in real life married Jennifer Garner) going back as the title role killer . Although she died in the former movie she returns thanks to her mentor and Sensei (Terence Stamp) . Elektra is resurrected and turns into a fearless warrior who survives a near-death experience ,her slickness is the result of a childhood accident , which means through the ordinary back-tale where a bad guy dispatch her mummy . The heroine becomes an assassin-for-hire in red-leathers and using her magic daggers , she tries to protect her two latest targets, a single father and his troubled young daughter , a rebellious bratty fourteen years old named Abby (Kristen Prout), from a group of supernatural assassins.

Convincing in the physical demands of the titular character Elektra ,well performed by Jennifer Garner as nihilist loner , she persuades us of her slick and dexterity . This exciting movie displays unstopped action, thrills ride, spectacular fighting, violence and is pretty amusing . When Jennifer Garner romance strikes with Goran , the screenplay manoeuvres into the lethal orbit as she takes on of both , crime lord and crack-shot assassins. It's an entertaining movie with its notably tougher action and violence , but lacks sometimes the utter fun factor and writers fail in the scrappy construction . It packs a colorful cinematography by Bill Roe and appropriate musical score fitting to action by Christopher Beck . The motion picture well produced by Arnon Milchan and the Marvel's usual, Avi Arad and the genius Stan lee ; being professionally directed by Rob Bowman . Rob is a good expert on Sci-Fi as ¨X-files series , Day break , Night stalker , Reign of fire¨ and many others .",Elektra
8,BA_Harrison,Elektra fails to electrify.,4,2 October 2006,"After her appearance as the love interest in the enjoyable Ben Affleck vehicle Daredevil, Jennifer Garner's Elektra is promoted to star of her own movie. Brought back from the brink of death by the mystical Stick (Terence Stamp) and trained in all manner of martial arts, Elektra eventually becomes an assassin. But when she is hired to kill a man and his teenage daughter, she breaks protocol and decides to protect them instead. She certainly has her work cut out for her as a group of supernatural killers are dispatched to finish Elektra's job.With a sexy assassin in a basque, ninjas galore, and a team of bad guys with magical powers, you would think it would be hard to make a dull film; somehow, however, director Rob Bowman manages to succeed in delivering an excitement-free movie.A dreadful script (which takes too long to really get going) and Bowman's over reliance on CGI and rapid MTV-style editing results in a tedious mess.As is the case with many a Marvel character, Elektra has 'issues'; she wrestles with her own personal demons which makes her a pretty unlikeable and moody cow. Throughout the film she has pointless flashbacks which only serve to slow the pace of the film even further. For some inexplicable reason, the writers have also seen fit to make her suffer from obsessive-compulsive syndrome, which makes for fun viewingNOT! Seeing Elektra carefully arranging her clothes, food and makeup isn't exactly what I want to see in an action film.When Elektra does find time to fight, the action is brief and shot in such a manner that one cannot really see what is happening. I guess this saves on actually having to choreograph a decent scrap, but its hardly nail-biting stuff. Bowman uses every 'Matrix'-style piece of visual trickery in the book and the film suffers for it. Why do so many of todays directors feel like they need to shoot a fight in such a way? Those Wachowskis have a lot to answer for!Although I only rate Garner as a 'moderate hottie', she certainly looks good in her tight red outfit; it's a shame, however, that she only wears this get-up during two scenes and spends the rest of the time in less flattering gear. Had the makers of this film delivered more in the way of eye-candy, I'd have definitely enjoyed it a whole lot more.She may have been brought back to life for this movie, but surely this disappointing effort sees the death of Elektra as a potential series.",Elektra
9,sunwarrior13,A Contractually Obligated Sequel,6,9 October 2012,"Daredevil's main squeeze gets resurrected in her own flick with this spin-off martial arts action film from director Rob Bowman in this superhero film,Elektra.It stars Jennifer Garner who plays the Marvel comics character Elektra Natchios,an international assassin whose weapon of choice is a pair of sai.Goran Visnjic,Will Yun Lee,Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and Terence Stamp co-star to play supporting roles.Elektra Natchios is a hired assassin whose origins are finally revealed after her old ninja clan the Hand brings her back from the dead to serve their evil purposes. Reunited with her old sensei Stick,she leaves the past behind her and is eventually given an assignment to kill Mark Miller and his daughter, Abby. When her conscience gets the best of her and she decides to protect them instead, it's up to the Hand's top assassins to track her down and finish the job. Fans of Marvel Comics might recognize Natassia Malthe as Typhoid Mary, another nemesis of Daredevil that joins in the hunt, along with other masters of the dark mystic arts, Tattoo, Stone, and the Hand's fearsome leader, Kirigi.Garner has proved that she can kick butt with the best of them, and some of the visual effects are impressive, but the action sequences tend to be anticlimactic, and there's not much to the story.The movie offers no surprises, and whether or not you'll appreciate its modest charms depends entirely on whether you too have been anticipating her new outfit.Is Elektra better than Daredevil? Not really, even with the distinct advantage of having all Garner and no Ben Affleck. That could be the spin off's greatest disappointment as Elektra lowered it back to Daredevil's level.They should have just called this movie Contractually Obligated Sequel because I can see no other reason why someone as talented and as smart as she is would want to do this film.",Elektra
10,LeonLouisRicci,Small Movie with a Big HeartHighly Underrated,7,21 March 2016,"Not Every Comic-Book/Super-Hero Movie has to be Ultra-Produced with Maxed-Out CGI Explosions and Mayhem. Sometimes a Character Study is Simply Enough.Jennifer Garner is Type-Cast here and it Works Just Fine. After Her stint on ""Alias"" she Morphed to ""Elektra"" without Any Effort. Her Brooding Fits the Character's Angst as She is Forced into a Situation that Requires Her Specific and ""Treasured"" Skills.The Villains are a Fine Adaptation of Bad Guys with Supernatural Abilities that turn the Screen into Cinematic Recreations of Comic-Book Grandiosity with Cool Color Schemes and Outlandish Abilities.The Movie is One of the Most Hated of the Super-Hero Genre, along with ""Catwoman"" (2004), and both are Knee-Jerk Reactions. The Fact that both are ""Female"" says Something. ""Supergirl"" anyone? Fanboys Never seem to Warm Up and Appreciate a ""Girl"" Kicking Ass. Except Maybe a ""Little Girl"" (less threatening) like in ""Kick-Ass"" (2010).But that's too Deep a Psychological Subject to Tackle in a Review of this type. Suffice to Say that ""Elektra"" is an Underrated Movie that Looks and Feels Different than Most of the Movies in the Genre. The Supporting Cast all do OK and the Fight Scenes Acquire an Ethereal Feel Befitting the Mystical Subject Matter and are somewhat Stylish.Overall, a Good Entry for the Character. The Film cannot be called Great but Certainly is Misunderstood and Trashed Undeservedly and seems to be Unfairly Compared to other more Bombastic and Popular Entries. This is not in the Same Category as the Big Names that Dominate the Box-Office and the Headlines. This is a Small Movie, but has a Big Heart, and yes, a Female Touch.",Elektra
11,poolandrews,Terrible.,2,8 October 2007,"Elektra (Jennifer Garner) is a female assassin with a troubled past, she accepts a job from her agent McCabe (Colin Cuningham, come to think of it assassins have agents?) to kill a young girl named Abby Miller (Kristen Pout) & her father Mark (Goran Visnjic), however Elektra becomes emotionally attached to them & cannot carry out the hit. Her employers are very sinister & powerful people so when they learn of her betrayal a group of magical warriors are sent to kill Elektra, Mark & capture Abby...Directed by Rob Bowman I have to confess I'm not a huge fan of comic book adaptations, with a few rare exceptions like Batman (1989) & the brilliant Blade (1998) they invariably turn out crap & Elektra is surely one of the very worst. The slow moving & dull script by Zak Penn, Stu Zicherman & Raven Metzner (they sound like fanboy geeks if their names are anything to go by) revolves the undead heroine Elektra from a comic book series & the film Daredevil (2003) in which Garner played Elektra opposite Ben Affleck who apparently filmed a cameo for this but it wasn't used, to be blunt it has a few reasonable set-pieces but all the stuff between them is just simply awful. For a start I hated every character in this film especially the annoying brat of a kid Abby who is not only irritating but a martial arts expert who can take four guy's all by herself, Elektra herself is a really unlikable & unsympathetic character which just doesn't sit right. I mean aren't we, the audience that is, supposed to root for the good guy's & gals? Why make her so distant, moody & just plain unlikable? Then there are the constant annoying flashback's to her childhood & past events which just become irritating, not only does it interrupt the flow of the proper story but the whole 'hero with a troubled past' is such a cliché & it's not even done very well here, in fact it's done terribly. The story itself is so lame & predictable, woman has to defeat assorted bad guy's to save the day & people she cares about, wow how amazingly brilliant. Not. Also why, if Elektra was paid to kill both Abby & Mark, did the bad guy's insist they wanted Abby alive all the time because she was the 'Treasure'? I mean what if Elektra had carried out her original orders & killed them both? At under 100 minutes Elektra feels twice as long & to top it all off it has the most sickly, sentimental happily ever after ending which lasts for something like 10 straight minutes just so everyone can get all emotional with each other, urgh.Director Bowman does OK, the infrequent fight scenes are reasonable but nothing particularly new or exciting. The CGI computer effects are good as expected. Elektra's red outfit looks alright although she barely gets a chance to wear it, if you look at photo's of actress Jennifer Garner she's a very attractive woman but in Elektra they make her look quite frumpy & old which is odd. The bad guy's are silly & have stupid special powers including the ability to conjure up an army of flying snakes... I would imagine the only reason this got made was because of the recent successful comic book adaptations of Spider-Man (2002), Blade (1998) & X-Men (2000).With a supposed budget of about $43,000,000 this had a lot of money pumped into it & quite frankly I don't think anyone got value for money, least of all any idiot who pays good money to watch it. Shot in Los Angeles & British Colombia in Canada. The acting sucks, Terence Stamp makes an appearance but I didn't recognise him. Kristen Pout as Abby really, really, really annoys.Elektra is crap, I'm sorry but it's as simple & straight forward as that. I have never read a comic with the Elektra character in it so I don't know if this films sticks to her origins, I don't know how die hard fans feel about this film but I doubt they like it. Oh, & Elektra made number 9 on Siskel & Ebert's 'The Worst of 2005' list, only number 9 lads?!?!",Elektra
12,dbborroughs,Everyone looks pained,4,13 February 2005,Did anyone have a good time making this film? I know I didn't have a good time watching it.Jennifer Garner is on record as saying she disliked making this and frankly it shows. It looks as though some one is poking her with a big stick through most of it. Most of the rest of the cast seem to be thinking of their next jobs. Its not fun to watch.The script is passable but with the disinterest of the actor's you never buy any of it.Yea the action and visual effects are good but there isn't enough to keep you awake.Go see something else instead.,Elektra
13,zardoz-13,"""Elektra"" Doesn't Top ""Davedevil"" But Isn't Bad!",7,21 June 2007,"Anti-obesity advocates will applaud the new Marvel Comics distaff action movie ""Elektra"" for its message that young women should watch their weight if they want to be touted by others as 'a treasure.' As the eponymous heroine of ""Elektra,"" ""Alias"" TV star Jennifer Garner doesn't have an ounce of adipose on her sculptured physique. Indeed, if her TV and film career ever dries up, this lean, mean, Valkyrie can model Victoria's Secrets' lingerie. Like Halle Berry's ""Catwoman,"" Garner's butt-kicking babe discards her ordinary everyday apparel in a crisis to wear a ridiculous but seductive costume that resembles the outfit of a classy call-girl. Indeed, you won't have a problem keeping your eye on Ms. Garner's drop-dead gorgeous Amazon, and she looks better than this thoroughly formulaic thriller that benefits from no-nonsense helming from veteran ""X-Files"" TV director Rob Bowman. Since he left ""The X-Files,"" Bowman has made some pretty good movies than ""Elektra."" Check out ""Reign of Terror,"" his supercharged 2002 fantasy about flying dragons in contemporary England with Christian Bale & Mathew McConaughey. Although the ""Elektra"" villains emerge as fascinating looking gang of hybrids forged in the ""X-Men"" mold, they slow down but never stop our heroine and the people that she is protecting. Bowman and his scenarist pit Elektra not only against physical adversaries, but they also pit her against herself. In the Marvel Universe, costume-clad crimefighters don't get a free ride. They experience problems, too. For example, our angst-ridden heroine suffers from bouts of loneliness, alienation, and an abusive father that haunts her memories in flashbacks, making her convincingly vulnerable and more believable as a fearless super heroine. No, you need not have seen 2003's ""Daredevil,"" the epic that spun off ""Elektra,"" to appreciate this feminine heroine's exploits. In fact, neither Daredevil nor his alter-ego, Matt Murdock, make a cameo in ""Elektra,"" and nobody says squat about her relationship with Daredevil.Anybody who saw the vastly superior ""Daredevil"" knows that Elektra Natchios died in that blockbuster during a rooftop confrontation with the villains. This time around Elektra's blind sensei Stick (Terence Stamp of ""Superman"") has brought her back from the dead, but he also evicts her from his martial arts training camp. He tells Elektra that she must resolve her anger management problem. As a result, Elektra turns into a highly-paid assassin. In the opening scene, she decimates an army of bodyguards and slays her victim, a despicable crime lord (the ever dependent but uncredited Jason Isaacs of ""Windtalkers""), without acquiring a scratch. Afterward, her agent who arranges hits for her, McCabe (Colin Cunningham of ""The 6th Day""), lands her a contract with a $2-million paycheck. A weary Elektra reluctantly accepts the job. Before she carries it out, she meets her intended victims, Mark Miller (""ER"" heartthrob Goran Visnjic) and his 13-year old daughter Abby (Kirsten Prout of ""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse""), and takes a shine to them. Not only is the attractive Miller a widower, but his daughter bonds with Elektra. Abby gets the mom she no longer has, and Elektra gets to redeem herself. Initially, a notorious Japanese syndicate known as 'The Hand,' with a pagoda atop a Tokyo skyscraper, paid Elektra for the hit. When she changes her mind, boss man Roshi (evil Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa of ""Rising Sun"") dispatches his pugnacious son Kirigi (Will Yuin Lee of ""Die Another Day"") and his unusual trio of killers: Typhoid Mary (Natassia Malthe of ""Lake Placid""), Stone (wrestling champ Bob Sapp), Tattoo (newcomer Chris Ackerman), and Kinkolu (another newcomer Edson T. Ribeiro) to murder the Millers and ice Elektra. These three pose a challenge, especially Typhoid with her touch of dead powers and Tattoo with his animals that materialize from his tattoos. As we learn later, Abby boasts superhuman powers that the Hand wish to exploit. This is the first major surprise in the movie. If the Hand cannot control Abby, they want her dead! ""X-Men 2"" scribe Zak Penn penned this lively, larger-than-life, acrobatic nonsense. No, ""Elektra"" doesn't top ""X2,"" but it is still entertaining hokum. Actually, Typhoid Mary imitates the ""X-Men"" heroine Rogue. Mary puts a lip lock on Elektra and drains the life out of our super heroine. Nobody rivals Tattoo with his tattoos that spring to life, especially the wolf and the snakes! Clearly, ""Elektra"" lacks the ""Daredevil"" budget. The ""Elektra"" villains aren't nearly as audacious as Kingpin and Bullseye. Again, the Hand look quiet, cool, and deadly, and they challenge our heroine and her friends. For example, Elektra battles Tattoo whose elaborate body art assumes a life of its own. Eagles flap out of his shoulder to keep track of Elektra when the Millers and she go on the lam. In Tattoo's coolest scene, a venomous variety of snakes materialize from his tats. Unfortunately, the threat that his body art poses to Elektra amounts to little in the long run. Elektra brushes off Tattoo without breaking a sweat. This is the chief problem with ""Elektra."" The villains topple like ten-pins. At one point, the egotistical Kirigi wedges his razor-sharp samurai sword against Elektra's bare neck. He has the perfect chance to kill her. Evidently, Penn wrote himself into a corner with this scene, because he lets Elektra off the hook far too easily. Instead of killing her without a second thought, the villain ignores her and pursues Abby. Granted, you cannot let your heroine die in an action thriller, at least not twice. But when the heroine gets herself into a predicament like Elektra finds herself, she should have to display some ingenuity to escape. Consequently, Elektra survives, because Kirigi behaves like a fool. Foolish villains do little to enhance the heroine's stature.Altogether, Jennifer Garner makes a strong heroine, and she has the moves down. Terence Stamp steals every scene that he has, and the blind Stick is reminiscent of Matt Murdock. The production values are suitably polished, and Bowman stages the combat scenes with above-average aplomb.",Elektra
14,grantss,Pretty bad,3,15 January 2016,"Pretty bad.After a near-death experience a government agent / superhero, Elektra (played by Jennifer Garner), retires to an island and, reluctantly at first, befriends her neighbours, a father and his teenage daughter. However, a criminal cartel is after her and they are using the best resources at their disposal...Was interesting, initially. The whole ""agent retires and then is forced back into service due to the bad dudes who won't let her retire in peace"" isn't that new, but it was interesting enough. The interest didn't last long. Pretty soon the movie resorted to lame, by-the-numbers, action scenes and supernatural villains, plus random turns of events that save the day.Even the action scenes aren't done very well. In an effort to blind us with all that impossible martial arts stuff that gets kids to watch a movie, the director speeds up the action scenes too much, and makes them unfocused and confusing.Avoid.",Elektra
15,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Such a waste of potential,5,31 October 2007,"You know, this could have been amazing. Ninjas, Marvel characters, and a story that could have been grand. This could have been downright epic. Had it been handled right. Directed by Rob Bowman, the man who brought us Reign of Fire, this takes a much more supernatural route than its parent film, Daredevil, for better or for worse. I must admit that I don't know much about Elektra of the comics... so I can't say for sure whether or not all the magic seen in this film is close to the source. They got the costume more or less right, and had they gone further towards the comics, the film might have garnered(pun intended) (even more) embarrassed reactions from its viewers. And she is actually an assassin in the film, which is accurate. I'm not sure about the efforts made to make the character still be likable to the audience. She is joined by Stick and The Hand... now, I don't know much about the former(not sure I've read more than one comic that he appeared in), but the latter could so easily have provided a magnificent story, that it's almost a travesty what they did put on the screen. Also with her is someone named McCabe, who wins us over early by inquiring about the title character's sex life, in a manner that leaves the viewer wondering if he knows the meaning of the word subtlety(although, to be fair, it may be the people behind the film itself who do not). The Millers are hardly better. Mark wouldn't be awful if he had just a hint of personality. Abby... frankly, it may be possible to scientifically prove that she is annoying. Granted, she isn't the most irritating that she could be, and there are times where she isn't, where she is tolerable, but being that she's one of the characters we're supposed to care the most about, she could have used work. It doesn't help that the kid isn't that great an actress. The production design isn't that memorable. I'm not sure the film holds even a single truly great image. The camera-work varies, but more often than not, it obscures the action, and it's in cahoots with the editing in this. Some parts are overly stylized. Many chances of actual action are passed up for showing us visual effects and magic instead. I'm afraid I can't claim that I'd rather see a man in a suit pull a rabbit, cute though it may be, out of his hat, than a skilled martial artist dish out some well-administered punches and kicks. The fighting is a mixed bag, but some of it is fairly good. Why there is so reasonably little of it(and hardly any mêlée weapons), in a film about *ninjas* is a rather appropriate question. Dialog, writing, acting, none of it is particularly mesmerizing. The film seems to present some of its plot as twists, in spite of much of it having been revealed in the trailer, and what little there was left, the viewer could easily piece together on their own. Magical powers seem inconsistent, and the film doesn't possess much of an ability to keep the viewer excited or engaged. There's too little of a sense of danger. I recommend this to fans of fantasy, and those who simply *must* watch everything that has to do with comic books(believe me, I don't blame you, it is difficult to find anything good). Those who like the comics, martial arts, and/or Daredevil the film should maybe think twice, at least before spending much money or energy to watch this. 5/10",Elektra
16,Uriah43,A Good Performance by Jennifer Garner Lessened by Poor Direction,5,14 May 2020,"Although the character of ""Elektra Natchios"" (Jennifer Garner) was killed in the movie ""Daredevil"", she is subsequently brought back to life at the being of this particular film by a blind martial arts master by the name of ""Stick"" (Terence Stamp) who then trains her in the art of Kimagure which allows her to see certain events in the near future. Unfortunately, her anger prevents her from realizing her full potential and as a result she is cast out of the school and becomes a hired assassin. Although she is quite successful and her skills are very much in demand, one specific contract begins to gnaw at her conscience and rather than killing a man by the name of ""Mark Miller"" (Goran Visnjic) and his teenage daughter ""Abby Miller"" (Kirsten Zien) she chooses to become their bodyguard instead. This infuriates a clandestine group known as ""the Hand"" who then becomes determined to kill all three of them. Not only that, but Elektra soon discovers that both Mark and Abby haven't been totally honest with her and this creates a new set of problems for her as well. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, although I liked the performance of Jennifer Garner, I didn't especially care for the amount of time and attention given to Abby as there were other characters who were much more interesting. But perhaps that's just me. In any case, even though this wasn't a great superhero film by any means, it was good enough for the time spent and for that reason I have rated it accordingly.

Elektra is a female assassin assigned to protect a father and daughter duo from a group called the Hand. These guys are bad. They are the kind of baddies who stole lunch money from smaller kids at school. Now they have demonic powers and Elektra finds it very difficult to perform her gift of ass kicking. The girl she is protecting is embarrassing especially when she leaps into action with powers of her own. Puh-lease! Director Rob Bowman makes things stylish while the screenwriter basically wrote what any kindergarten major would come up with. Jennifer Garner looks hot in her Elektra outfit but she is really there just to fight. She provides no personality to the role, and Terence Stamp is her blind mentor must have been so if he signed onto this project. Also featured in less than stellar performances are Goran Visnjic, Kirsten Prout and Will Yun Lee who will no doubt cross their agents off their Christmas giving list. While the special effects are passable, the film is about as suspenseful as an episode of Sesame Street. It is hardly a major comic book and its adaptation is among the worst of the lot. It was bad enough that she was featured in Daredevil. This is a pointless comic book crap that is less than electrifying. Score: 3 / 10",Elektra

19,JamesHitchcock,A Way of Whiling Away the Time While Eating Popcorn,4,12 October 2007,"Some comic book characters have entered into popular culture to such an extent that they are instantly recognisable even to people like myself who gave up reading comic books at about the same age as I gave up wearing short trousers. These characters (Superman, Batman, Spiderman, the Hulk, Fantastic Four, etc) have provided the main material for Hollywood's long-running love-affair with the superhero blockbuster, an affair dating back to the original Christopher Reeve ""Superman"" from 1978. Although Wonder Woman has been strangely neglected, most of the really famous superheroes have now been used up, so the studios are now forced to turn to the more obscure characters, Elektra being a case in point. Had anyone other than comic book addicts ever heard of her before this film came out? Or rather before ""Daredevil"" came out two years earlier- I have never seen that film but I understand that she also features in it.The title character has quite a complicated back-story, parts of which are told in flashback in the movie. She was at one time in training at a mystical martial arts academy, but was rusticated by her trainer for having too much violence and rage inside her. I would have thought that those would have been considered desirable qualities in an organisation whose main purpose is fighting, but this is the sort of quasi-religious fighting brotherhood, akin to the Jedi in ""Star Wars"", which insists that all its members should be pure in soul. (Terence Stamp's characterisation of Elektra's mentor Stick owes much to Yoda). You can kill people, or beat them up, but only if you do it in the right spirit. Which explains why I've always had my reservations about the martial arts cult, at least in its Western manifestations; it seems like a way of being violent while at the same time feeling holy about oneself.After her expulsion from the academy, Elektra sets up in business as a hired assassin, but has her doubts about that line of work when she is hired to kill her neighbours Mark and Abby Mills. As Mark is a handsome widower in his thirties and Abby his cheeky but lovable thirteen-year-old daughter, it is quite predictable that Elektra's conscience will get the better of her when it comes to doing the dirty deed, and so it proves. The bad guys who hired Elektra to carry out the hit do not take kindly to being frustrated in this way, and come after her looking for revenge, so she is forced to team up with her old martial arts chums, who have a long-running feud with the bad guys, an organisation known as ""The Hand"". (The Hand's main purpose is to take control of Abby, who has been born with extraordinary supernatural powers). Although the whole atmosphere of the film is suffused with a sort of mystical Orientalism, there seems to be a curiously old-fashioned element of racism; the leaders of The Hand are all Japanese, while the heroes (Elektra, Stick, Mark and Abby) are all Caucasian.""Elektra"" is essentially a sword-and-sorcery movie updated from a remote legendary past to the present. Despite the modern setting, the technology on show is primitive- the two sides battle it out not with guns but with bare fists, sticks, swords and daggers. When, before her crisis of conscience, Elektra plans to kill Mark and Abby, her weapon of choice is a bow and arrow. As for sorcery, the brand of martial arts which the good guys follow (the baddies have some supernatural skills of their own) gives them the ability not only to break bricks with their bare hands and to fend off the attacks of their opponents but also to see into the future and to bring people back from the dead.Most sword-and-sorcery films are pretty dreary affairs. There are some exceptions to this rule (Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy being the most spectacular) but ""Elektra"" is not one of them. The plot is basically just another heroes-and-villains battle, and the attempts to narrate Elektra's back-story are confusing. The film lacks the depth of characterisation found in some of the better superhero movies (such as, for example, ""Spiderman""); Jennifer Garner never makes the heroine someone we can care about. The best that can be said about the film is that it is a way of whiling away the time while eating popcorn. 4/10",Elektra

Kirsten Prout plays the teenage character Abby Miller(Mark's daughter)and she does an admiral job here.and yes they do fit into the story.Terence Stamp is brilliantly cast as Electra's mentor.the cast of villains was also represented by some fine performances.but the thing i really like most is that Electra is given a back story and personality complete with a few quirks.the only minor problem with the film is that the special effects while not poorly done,could have been a bit better.another positive thing about this film is that the fight scenes are well choreographed,with some amazing stunts.and i can't forget the mystique.the film had an aura of mystery surrounding it.overall,a well paced entertaining film 8/10",Elektra

As usual there's a lively secondary character (in this case Natassia Malthe as 'Typhoid') to remind you of what could have been; but the presence of Terence Stamp unfortunately serves as a reminder of the mess Joseph Losey made nearly four decades earlier of 'Modesty Blaise'.Watch an episode of 'Wonder Woman' instead.",Elektra
23,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"This time, there's no Evanescence.",4,16 May 2019,"'Elektra (2005)' isn't as bad as most people say. Still, it's not exactly good, either. After a slow-paced, flashback-based first act, the flick takes a pretty sharp turn into straight-up silly territory. It's relatively realistic prior to this - and its world is still somewhat grounded after - which makes the transition pretty jarring. However, it's this that really kicks things into (admittedly limited) gear, since it leads to most of the movie's ironic enjoyment. Everything is presented with a straight-face and almost everything verges on being utterly stupid - with a few late-game aspects actually tipping the scales - but there's just something oddly compelling about it all. It's entertaining to see it tick off every trope it can while pretending that it isn't exactly what everyone else knows it is. It's also harmless enough. For a mid-2000s female-led superhero film, it's actually remarkably good - or progressive, I suppose. Of course, there are a few of dodgy camera angles to highlight the tightest parts of the tight outfit and a couple of unnecessary on-screen kisses (including a girl-on-girl kiss that's lingered on for just a little too long, especially considering its deadly plot purpose). Still, Elektra herself tends to take charge of the situation and never even comes close to being saved by a man. Plus, there isn't actually a conventional romance - in fact, it leans more towards mother-daughter relationships. However, the overall plot is both too simple and too messy, making just enough sense that you don't question it but requiring too much thought - and too many hand-waves - to piece together properly (especially when it comes to everybody's motives). Even then, some things don't quite fit together. The action isn't terrible but it's generally uninspired, even if there are some unintentionally amusing moments. Still, there's just something sort of strangely endearing about it all. It leans heavily into its supernatural side, which is far goofier than they (presumably) expected but does set this apart from the others, of a similar age, in its genre. It also has a decent pace to it - at least, when it gets going - and isn't devoid of character, even if they're all a little flat. Look, it's far from a masterpiece. In fact, it's slightly below average, if we're being honest. It's forgettable but it's not awful. It's much better than 'Daredevil (2003)'. 4/10",Elektra
24,bowmanblue,She's aliiiiive!,6,25 May 2014,"Yes, despite *sort of* being bumped off in 'Daredevil' Elektra returns for her own self-titled 'spin-off' movie. This, in itself, is odd. For a start, Daredevil (featuring a 'blind' Ben Affleck clad in red rubber, also an image which caused many a trauma in cinema-goers since witnessing it) didn't exactly set the box offices alight in the way its producers hoped it would. So, one wonders why they decided to green-light a (semi) sequel.I've never read any of the comic books this film is based on, so I can't really say how faithful it remains. But I do know that Jennifer Garner does look better in her costume that her off-screen hubby Ben did (male perspective only), but a costume alone does not really warrant an entire ninety minute movie. Here we meet Elektra as she's forced to confront her demons and also protect a single father and his teenage daughter (convenient 'love interest' if ever there was one).So, expect some martial arts fighting as she whacks one ninja on the head after the next, plus a kind of plot twist that doesn't really affect the overall story in any way. About halfway through the film, the fight scenes start using 'special moves' instead of just punches and kicks. Yes, it adds a little something extra to the constant fight scenes, but the CGI effects aren't that great as someone launches yet another computer-added smoking fireball to their punches and kicks.Elektra was released just before Marvel basically cornered the market on superheroes movies with their 'Avengers' franchise and its predecessors. Therefore, it's not half as much fun as any of them. Then again... it was also released before Christopher Nolan did his Batman trilogy, so it's also not as dark and menacing as then. It kind of sits somewhere in the middle in that big empty hole filled with superhero movies which, despite being okay, never really amounted to what they could have been.You can basically have Elektra on in the background while you potter around your living room. You'll still be able to follow it and can just tune in for the good bits.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Elektra
25,MLDinTN,"OK story, but didn't like the supernatural villains",6,29 November 2005,"This film was very violent for pg13. The director got around an R rating by making the bad guys supernatural instead of real people. So when Elektra sticks her swords through them, instead of blood everywhere, they just crumble into green dust. I thought that was very silly.Elektra is a killer on her latest mission. She befriends a young girl, Abby, and her dad. Later, she finds out they are her targets but can't go through with it. So, she saves them from the hand's men and takes them to her master for help. She soon learns why the Hand was after Abby, and it reminds her a lot of herself.There were several neat fights and some cool special effects, such as the animals from tattoo. I just didn't like all the supernatural traits of the villains. They were real people, so they should die like real people. The plot was OK, but nothing great. I can see why this film bombed at the box office. But, it wasn't as bad as some reviews made it out to be. I think the over-saturation of films about super heroes from the comics is the main reason this film did not well. If it doesn't have the super effects like Spiderman, then it is just going to get over looked.FINAL VERDICT: IF you like action flicks, then you will probably like this.

There's just so many dumb things in this. Elektra didn't even show up in her uniform until the last fourth of the movie! Again, ""Power Rangers"" did this better. The special effects with the CGI are really bad in this and the villains are just laughable.From the very get go, the story is dumb. The villain is apparently unaware that Elektra knows what it's like to die, even though he just said she came back! She ends up falling in love this one guy and there's absolutely no buildup to it at all and it's such poorly written romance. I feel bad for female comic book fans seeing as how there has yet to be a decent movie starring a female superhero. I don't have much hopes for ""Wonder Woman"".

27,CuriosityKilledShawn,Better than expected,6,2 April 2005,"I thought Daredevil was an absolutely pointless film with anonymous direction and an unappealing, non-unapalling lead actor. Thankfully, Elektra has a prettier lead and stronger direction from Rob Bowman, who seems to have ditched the slimy creature effects he seemed so fond of in X-Files and Reign of Fire.Daredevil is nowhere near as popular in the collective public conscience as Spiderman or even the Hulk. So imagine why Elektra failed at the Box Office. The whole world saw the poster and thought 'Who is she supposed to be?'. Either that or they saw the horrible, highly clichéd trailer that totally misrepresented the film.The resulting critical mauling by just about everyone wasn't completely fair nor was it completely unexpected. The film reeks of deleted scenes and subplots that have been completely cut out. It fades out at the 90-minute mark, leaving us wondering why they even bothered.However, what we do get is a mild, but nonetheless entertaining action movie with an almost constant spooky atmosphere. The plot is meagre and many of the subs and tangents are never explained or developed. Or they were then they were cut out in the editing room (along with Ben Affleck, thankfully)? If they got Frank Miller (he did create the character after all!) to write the script instead of 3 nobodies then it could have been something special.The DVD is in crisp 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with loud, sometimes dynamic Dolby/DTS 5.1 sound. Besides a trailer for the new Family Guy series the extras are of the usual 'whogivesadamn' lot.Perhaps a future directors cut will improve the film, but as it is Elektra is hardly brilliant, but definitely an above average brainless movie.",Elektra

Even by the standards of the action genre (which is by the way the lowest ranked genre on my scale) this is lame.

Characters are not even two-dimensional but transparent, acting is decent at best and, in my opinion, Jennifer Garner as Elektra is lousy choice. And the end... When they already made this movie the way they did, they should have stayed consistent to pathetic and end it with wedding of Elektra and Goran Vinjić.

But Elektra provides a new but not easy balance of tenderness, mysticism, and kick-ass that mesmerizes some.

32,johnnyboyz,Hellektra on Earth in terms of whether it's a good film or not.,4,10 October 2007,"I'm not quite sure if the whole world was pining for a spin-off of a secondary character from a comic book that had been made into a film a few years previously in the form of Daredevil (2003) but it was followed through with anyway; in fact most comic book adaptations of comic characters such as Daredevil, Elektra, Catwoman or whatever probably aren't crucial to America's film industry but what the hell; we're given them anyway. Unfortunately, Elektra is very much a bad case of not only repetition but also tedium.I hadn't seen Daredevil before this but got the feeling I didn't need to have done since Elektra's (Garner) introduction is presented anyway; given to us by Stick, played by a Terrance Stamp who was obviously short of cash round about the time this was made. It seems Elektra used to be someone important, so important that she was hunted down, killed and then brought back to life again by Stick only to return not to avenge but to merely continue murdering in the world that is the business of killing. The film seems violent but there isn't any gratuity, Elektra wears what looks like nothing but a rag throughout yet we don't really get any nudity and nobody ever swears in the world in which they live giving off a false atmosphere.What's really wrong with Elektra is that there are about a dozen obligatory scenes throughout the film: scenes that are there because they've become associated with the genre and are now nothing more than clichés. What's really, really wrong with Elektra is that half of these occur in the opening forty minutes completely suspending belief that any of this could really happen (if of course you forget the fact she dies and then lived again). Some of these scenes include the customary 'who's in my house' as Elektra goes upstairs and I kid you not, just before it's revealed who it is I was thinking to myself ""It'll be nobody harmful, maybe a child."" Sure enough; it was Abby Miller (Prout), the daughter to Mark (Visnjic). There is also the scene involving Elektra's agent and his piece of heroism as well as the development of the friendship with the child and the love interest with Mark twinned with the fact the family is coincidentally motherless (Elektra comes along at just the time to act as the female lead within the family) and I really, really hated the scene where Elektra decides not to go with them and help them but then of course Abby opens her mouth and a change of heart kicks in; clichéd and unbelievable nonsense masquerading in a film that is action starved, violence starved (even though Elektra uses two swords) and uninteresting.Elektra does have some interesting ideas to do with its antagonists who are a right couple of characters straight out of an X-Men film. One such character can bring alive his tattoos, one can seemingly withstand anything in the same vein as Fantastic Four's 'The Thing' and a woman who can kill anything with a kiss or a touch. These are interesting ideas and concepts for character to have but again; since the film relies on silly action pretending to be epic kung-fu as well as the fact the action is kept to a minimum for the MPAA rating, whatever good ideas are here are not used or developed into anything beyond nice effects to look at on screen: a scene where the guy's tattoos turn into wolves and when the ground is dying around Typhoid (Malthe) are consequently the only good things to occur since these characters utilise personal powers they have rather than anything else; thus fight scenes are impossible with these enemies.The film as a whole is a messy and familiar tale of unhappy protagonist who gets involved with something they shouldn't have done only to find themselves in deeper waters. The fight scenes are unspectacular, the messages of self enlightenment are out of place (they worked in The Matrix but not in this junk), the element of the supernatural turns the film from action, kung-fu into science fiction and the characters are either so one dimensional or underused that we don't care for them  a film to instantly forget.",Elektra

35,TheMovieDiorama,"Elektra assassinated its ""plot"" for Garner's flat stomach and eternal breezes.",3,30 December 2018,"Oh my. Can no one write decent roles for the protagonist in female-lead blockbusters? I have never seen a character undergo so many personality changes in one film, until now. But that's the least of this film's worries as the problems that are littered throughout are ludicrously noticeable. So much so, that I started to wonder about menial issues like ""why is Garner's cleavage constantly well lit for the camera?"". Talk about unnecessary sexualisation. Anyway, after the events of 'Daredevil', Elektra is brought back to life and is tasked in assassinating a father and daughter. Unable to do so, she must then go up against ""The Hand"" and protect her targets. It started off well. Garner looked the part for the role, despite some wobbly acting, and committed to the infrequent action sequences. The character of Elektra had this serious persona, to which the somewhat dark narrative complemented her personality.Then, after waiting thirty minutes, I realised that all I watched was training montages, a plethora of flat stomach displays and endless winds that made her hair and silky tassels gently wave in the breeze (even when inside...). There was a serious lack of plot that made the entire ordeal dull and monotonous. She meets a girl and a man who coincidentally turned out to be the targets. It was at that point I knew that the over reliance of my favourite criticism was in motion. Plot conveniences. The daughter is then apparently well equipped with a tiny whip, the dad disappears for the last half and one of the antagonising ""The Hand"" members unleashes wolf missiles. Stone, an impenetrable individual who stops bullets and breaks daggers, is crushed by a tree. The penultimate battle involves Elektra vigorously flailing her daggers...at floating cloths. Essentially what I'm getting at, is that the screenplay was atrocious. Inherently stupid. One scene Elektra is this tough flat stomached cookie, the next she is this joyous flat stomached motherly figure and then kissing the daughter's dad with no preconceived romance. Her schizophrenic-like behaviour is all over the place, and highlights the incompetent writing of its three writers. The action consisted of slow motion jumps and running. ""The Hand"" were underused (much like all of the characters). And, to be quite frank, suffers from an identity crisis. Aside from the decent opening sequence and Garner's resemblance of the character, Elektra pretty much ""elektracuted"" its chances of being a passable superhero flick.",Elektra
36,Tweetienator,Solid Action,6,6 June 2020,"Why this one got such a bad rating and bad reviews I don't understand. Elektra is no masterpiece but beats most Marvel or DC shows of today. It has also not the greatest production so it can't compete with the super-big productions of these days regarding settings and fx etc., but it is an entertaining popcorn-flick, and last but not least, Elektra promotes (like the Tomb Raider movies with Angelina Jolie or Aeon Flux with Charlize Theron) a female hero - some years before that got en vogue and now every slim girl can beat a bunch of heavyweight male champions. Anyway, solid and entertaining, and we get hot Jennifer too and some good old ninjas! Recommended if you like those aforementioned movies.",Elektra
37,digitalbeachbum,Quasi super heroes,1,21 September 2021,"Daredevil, Elektra, Black Widow, Deadpool, Nightwing or Hawkeye. These sort of super human people are worthless superheroes. Maybe to fight some local mafia Kingpin or low life criminal, they tend to be everyday people who have some heightened ability, just a bit better than a regular human. They certainly wouldn't be able to fight higher level villains, or cosmic being.Elektra is one of them and this movie shows why they are boring. The script was poorly written and the direction sucked too. I never was interested in anything about the character enough to want them to succeed at anything. They lacked any sensibility. They lacked emotion. They lacked intelligence.There was potential for something cool. It could have been a Spider-Man success, but the conversion from comic to the big screen failed.",Elektra
38,FiendishDramaturgy,Flawed but fun,8,30 January 2005,"I can see why comic book purists aren't happy with Elektra, but they are missing out on a fun 90+ minutes!Firstly, let me congratulate Ms. Garner on a hard-fought and dedicated embodiment of Elektra. Her performance alone, would have been enough to make this an enjoyable endeavor, had it needed to carry the movie. She worked very hard with the choreographer, trained long days, and did her own stunts! And while this was a flawed presentation, I found it was still enjoyable.Fortunately, it was not necessary for Garner to support this work alone. Kirsten Prout's portrayal as Abby was beautiful. She exhibited a wide range of emotions and abilities with which my hometown audience was spellbound. Terence Stamp demonstrated a lovely versatile acting style which I had never before seen from him. His portrayal was honest and utterly realistic.I do not agree with the common hatred for Daredevil (the first movie of this vein, and to which Elektra is a sequel), but in spite of the Affleck bashers out there, I enjoyed the appetencial spirit exhibited in Daredevil, and the intellectual and physical rapport between Affleck and Garner's characters. The characters and action were steeped in Japanese mysticism, combined with some impressive free-wheeling martial arts, and a few over the top wire flights which did nothing to detract from the action. I thoroughly enjoyed the wonderful level of suspense generated by the sinister plot, and solidly backed up by the action sequences. It held a beautiful synergy throughout the endeavor. Garner stayed true to the personality of Elektra Natchios, even when it seemed dangerous for her future career. She took risks and allowed superior direction to take over when necessary. Unfortunately, the director (Bowman) doesn't seem to feel the need to give us enough of the back story. We don't know much about the Hand, or Mr. Stick, except that they were there, and how they acted when in our presence. We did get some quality character development concerning Elektra, but I also wanted more of Abby and why she was so necessary. He does let you know; he does give you just enough to get through the movie without disappointment. But not enough to satisfy either the real fans of the genre or casual fans who are lacking the foreknowledge of the series. (Now, in all honesty, it is quite obvious that Stick and Daredevil are aligned in some way, as they are both blind and seem to use the same fighting style.)The plot is as deeply mystical as are the characters. It has been criticized as weak and tripping itself up. However, I did not find one scene which did not seem to know where it was going. Each dissolve was as seamless as the one before it, and each small bit of the story connected nicely with the next. As I've indicated, however, there could have been a bit more in the way of explanation of some of these beautiful plot and design elements, but all in all we were thoroughly engrossed. There was no snickering or quiet muttering going on during this. That in itself is rare for our hometown theater.While this wasn't the spring board out of the (commonly perceived) mire of Daredevil the studios hoped it would be, it does well to stand on its own due to Jennifer Garner's dedication and professionalism. We found this work to be an honest, fresh, and heart-warmingly solid source of entertainment.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",Elektra
39,dee.reid,"Jennifer Garner ""'Elektra'-fies"" and not much else",7,27 January 2005,"There's a certain kind of female action hero that's becoming more and more prevalent in today's cinema: the kind of woman that's sweet as honey but if rubbed the wrong way, will cut your head off in a second; Elektra Natchios is one such female.But this is pretty much the whole point of Rob Bowman's ""Elektra,"" a spin off of 2003's ""Daredevil,"" which stars Jennifer Garner (of ""Alias"") as the sexy red-leather-clad vixen of the title.There hasn't been a female action star as ""elektric"" (or convincing) as Garner, who makes the movie work despite its many inconsistencies and problems of logic (which I'm sure an injection of excised footage in an appropriate director's cut could easily cure).The character of ""Ripley"" (Sigourney Weaver of the ""Alien"" films) was the last female star to really capture my interest in this respect, and Garner pulls off the brooding ""Elektra"" in spades, and then some.""Elektra"" is by far Marvel Comics' most lethal female assassin, who as near as I can tell, is best remembered for her death in the ""Daredevil: Visionaries"" comics by Frank Miller. Indeed Miller's work appears to have been the largest source of inspiration for Bowman's 2005 adaptation and the film surely enough also borrows enough elements from other similar-themed movies of this particular genre.In the movies, when Garner portrays Elektra Natchios, we know that she met her demise on a lonely rooftop in ""Daredevil"" and as the film opens, she has already been dead and revived by her blind sensei Stick (Terence Stamp), and is engaged on her latest hit. (The movie also happens to conveniently shed itself of any references to the previous film and makes no mention of Matt Murdock or Bullseye or the Kingpin from ""Daredevil."")She's later sent off to an isolated location in preparation for her next assignment. It's a bit of an understatement to say that Elektra suffers from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (or OCD) and has everything properly arranged around her house. She spends her days lying about the house, killing time as that murderous itch eats away at her mind like a cancer. In these scenes, we're also treated to some really tense flashbacks about her past, which reveal the tragedies of her life that were only dwelled upon briefly in ""Daredevil.""She lights up like a Christmas tree when the photographs of her next victims come in through the mail and surprise, surprise: it's the kind man Mark (Goran Visnjic) and his daughter Abby (Kirsten Prout) who live in the cabin next door to her. Elektra had caught the rebellious Abby breaking into her house and of course, she had agreed to not tell Mark that she caught Abby trying to steal her Braille necklace.In the meantime, a brief romance develops between Elektra and Mark, which of course impedes on her assignment. But like the plot requires, they'll have to put it on hold, as Elektra must eventually battle the supernatural (?) assassins on their trail from the powerful criminal organization The Hand, and their lethal leader Kirigi (Will Yun Lee), who evidently is as skilled as Elektra at combat and this of course leads to one spectacular final climax between the two.People who were angry about Elektra not being an assassin in ""Daredevil"" will get their just desserts here. Elektra is ruthless but not cold like she was in the comics. I'm not one for comparing comics to their film adaptations but this kind of got to me, especially knowing how lethal Elektra truly is. But in ""Daredevil,"" she was simply Elektra the Avenger, not Elektra the Assassin.I really can't picture another actress other than Garner to really play Elektra, since she has that ruthless assassin part down pat, but is a little uneven when it comes to the more emotional components of the script. Elektra's relationships have always been troubled and here it's no different, but it seems that Garner was struggling with her pseudo-mother-daughter scenes with Abby, and for that maybe Bowman is partially responsible.The action is highly stylized and reminds me a lot of the martial arts movies from the 70s, which apparently served as a huge influence on the film's style. Bowman isn't the best director in the world, but he handles it all right without too much difficulty.Does ""Elektra"" deliver the goods - yes. Will it satisfy hardcore fanboys - probably not. Did I like it? Yes, if I didn't, I wouldn't have rated it with a ""7,"" even though this movie is a clear indication of failed potential and excessive studio interference, if indeed a director's cut is on the way in the future.7/10",Elektra
40,alindsay-al,A truly awful comic book film,1,11 August 2016,"My friend lent me this film and I now realise this is one of the worst films I have seen especially comic book wise. The premise of the film sees a recently resurrected elektra attempting to protect a family from an evil ninja organisation. Jennifer garner reprises her role as elektra from daredevil and she just doesn't do anything for the character. She comes across as very bland in this film and her character development just isn't existent and it does feel like garner didn't want to be there. The supporting cast also are really bland, the father daughter combo of mark and Abby Miller were just very cliché characters and you never care about either of them. The villains are also ridiculously over the top and they just come across as forced performances. The only performance that I slightly liked was Terence stamp as stick who I thought did the best he could do with this film. The story has absolutely no depth to it at all. You don't care about anybody in this film so when the story tries to be more dramatic you won't care. Also the flashbacks in this film are just so unnecessary and they don't add anything to the film. The script has some really cheesy dialogue in it and the drama doesn't work. The style has some awful action scenes in it that are ruined by a terrible sense of stunt work and cinematography. Overall this film is really not worth watching at all and you should avoid it at all cost.",Elektra

42,Enchorde,"Great disappointment, and I didn't expect much to begin with",3,9 June 2005,"** HERE BE SPOILERS **Recap: Elektra is working as an assassin, and a great one at that. After her last job, she needs some time off, and she finds refuge on a remote island. She meets a kid, Abby, and her father, Mark, and tries some kind of normality. But that don't work out, and she accepts another mission, which turns out to be Abby and Mark. Apparently they are wanted dead by the evil organization the Hand. Elektra suddenly decides to protect them instead, and the battle begins... Unfortunately for them, their opponents are not mere humans.Comments: So this is a spin-off from Daredevil. Elektra has gotten her own movie, unfortunately the character Elektra in this movie is nothing like what I remember from Daredevil. In this movie Elektra is cold and asocial, but still handy with her weapons. So that was a disappointment, and it is not rescued by a good story either. Actually, the story is almost non-existent. There are some, not very spectacular, fights, and that's it. And the addition of the superhuman abilities is just ridiculous. Combined with the story, the movie is just stupid and silly. Garner may be good looking, but you cannot expect that to carry an entire movie. If you're a fan of Elektra, you should watch Daredevil again, it is so much better. The final, and maybe biggest, disappointment is the ending fight. Absolutely no suspense (which goes for the entire movie), it's short and not very spectacular. Actually it was boring. I didn't really expect it to be the ending fight if not most of the bad guys (not all, but the rest are completely forgotten and unexplainable dropped from the story) had been killed, and the movie ended shortly after...

44,aimless-46,What a Mess,1,28 April 2005,"Although forewarned I was not totally prepared for how staggeringly bad this thing actually was. Although in fairness I had to actually see it to believe it, because the suck level is beyond anything I could have imagined. Think about the producers of the second ""Charlie's Angels"" movie doing a remake of ""Enter the Dragon"" with the Angels cast and you get some idea of ""Elektra"". Wherever the $40 plus million budget ended up, it was not on the screen.Even from its inception the idea was suspect. Since ""Daredevil"" occupies pretty much the lowest rung on the superhero ladder, that makes ""Electra's"" status subterranean; they truly were scraping the bottom of the barrel. Add to this a really lame script (most cartoons have more subtle story lines and better dialog), uninteresting production design, and really bad direction and you can at least figure out why it is so bad.But that leaves the mystery of why a studio,whose goal is to make (not lose) money, ever gave a green-light to the project. In may be that since comic titles like ""Elektra"" are basically sexploitation, the money people looked at the of casting Jennifer Garner and Natassia Malthe and saw huge sexploitation potential. Unfortunately someone forgot to tell this to the director and the DP because the filming of the two actresses is totally sterile (and they wonder why this thing lost money). The movie's fight scenes suffer from ADD; each shot is a nanosecond long which negates any need for stunt work. choreography, or effects. There's even a showdown sequence where a bunch of laundry fights with the actors. At least this is original although it might have been used in a ""Charlie Chan"" movie.Jennifer Garner looks confused most of the time. Like they did a lot of tight shots on her face in the studio and cut them randomly into action footage produced by the second unit. These reaction shots just make her look totally clueless, I was also surprised by how old she looks, hard to believe she is just 33. She has clearly outgrown this type of role and I felt embarrassed for her.It seems inconceivable that ""anyone"" would find this entertaining although apparently a few people actually liked it.",Elektra
45,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Doesn't offer a lot of what it promises,5,29 May 2014,"Almost all Marvel characters have their own fan base, including the lesser known ones. Out of this group, Elektra stands right in the middle. Comic book fans and viewers alike remember her from Daredevil (2003), but her presence wasn't the main focus nor was her character arc given much material to work with. But for those who enjoyed her appearance, fans were surprised to find their female antihero have a chance to have her own story told separately two years later. It's one of those times where this kind of attention could help boost popularity of the character or trash it completely. Sadly, this follow up to the already mixed feelings that Ben Affleck's Daredevil (2003) had left behind didn't help leave any sympathy for this when it was released. I really wanted to give it a slightly above positive rating but there are various reasons to why it just doesn't satisfy like it says it would.The story attempts at keeping fans happy by having scenes that directly connect it to Daredevil (2003) but then immediately stray away off it. Elektra (Jennifer Garner), ends up being reborn from her death caused by Bullseye and from then on, lives as an assassin for hire. One day when called upon what seems to be another routine target, Elektra begins to realize that there's more than meets the eye. Jennifer Garner works as Elektra; her figure and face are attractive along with her ability to perform the required action sequences. The cast does contain a few familiar faces, but the rest isn't memorable nor are they given any depth. Accompanying Elektra is her agent McCabe (Colin Cunningham), who has a couple of comical lines but other than that doesn't have much of a background to why and how he decided to help her. Elektra also comes into contact with a father and daughter played by Goran Visnjic and Kirsten Prout respectively. Both of which also do not give performances that are anything that'll stick as memorable. The motivations to both characters are wafer thin and written as if they should have emotional attachments by the end of the movie, but don't convey it. It's very difficult for an audience to feel attached and invested in a character that is thrown in just as a plot device. How is it that the three writers, one of which (Zak Penn) wrote for X-Men 2 (2003) couldn't make a screenplay that felt any less original?Making things even more confusing are the powers that Elektra now has. Instead of just being an assassin, Elektra now has the ability to see possible future events and visualize where her opponents are that are out of her physical sight. When were these special powers given to her? Just because this movie is under Marvel, does not mean every main character has to have super powers. This is just another element that makes the movie feel very generic because it's trying to be like every other superhero movie. Sometimes, being extremely skilled is all a character needs. Look at the Punisher or Batman films, they don't have super powers and they get by in life just fine with whatever skills they learned through their adult life. All Elektra needs are her sais and her ninja like skills and she's good to go.But perhaps the more frustrating part about the story telling is how reliant it is on flashbacks. There are numerous dream sequences that attempt to show that Elektra is a tragic character, but all it does is create confusion and possible annoyance because of how frequently they keep reoccurring. The familiar faces the audiences will recognize are Terence Stamp who plays Elektra's blind sensei named Stick. Honestly, Stamp doesn't even look like he's acting blind at times, which feels weird because Stamp is an accomplished actor. Audiences will also see an uncredited Jason Isaacs who gives audiences a brief background to Elektra's reborn mystery. Playing the main villain's father is Roshi played by Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa. He's always a nice actor to see on screen, although in this movie his presence has no importance what so ever. Then there is Will Yun Lee who plays the main antagonist Kirigi. Lee is good at playing a cool and swift moving ninja but again, he's nothing that truly stands out. However, when it comes to action it is lively. Like it was stated before, Garner can perform the required action sequences and it's awesome when she's in the Elektra garb. Even when fighting off various underdeveloped and uninspired henchmen that follow Kirigi, it is still fun thankfully. Also with those action sequences, the special effects at least blend nicely with the surroundings. There wasn't a scene that looked out of place or extremely fake. However, the action is also very sporadic. The finale works but it takes an awful long time to get there and the action scenes in between aren't long enough to sustain the rest of the scenes entailing exposition and flashbacks. There is one other element that works here though and that's Christophe Beck's score. Beck's music contains a reoccurring theme for Elektra and some very deep string action cues that help elevate the action sequences. Surprisingly, even the scenes that are supposed to be emotional (that aren't), Beck provides the right keys to make it sound emotional. It's a good listening experience for a comic book movie. Sadly, the film as a whole still middles between not bad nor good.Even with action that entertains, engaging music and an attractive lead, the good is equal to its bad components. The writing is formulaic, generic, contains several unexplained details and has very few performances that stand out. A weak Marvel film that deserved more.",Elektra

For any half-intelligent person there is enough in this film to drag it into the high sixes.It IS a stand-alone film and has nothing whatsoever to do with DAREDEVIL which was enjoyable synthetic fluff, no more - no less and really served no other purpose than to introduce Elektra.I'm no fan of Marvel comics either - ANY comics come to that. I left all that behind with dear old Rupert Bear in the early fifties.ELEKTRA should be viewed simply as a film - not a comic book adaptation. It has plenty going for it. Great cinematography, credible dialog for the most part, state of the art action sequences and heaps of style - something Daredevil did NOT.Certainly slow in its formative stages - that is what probably alienated attention-deficient audiences worldwide. Once you have to listen AND think...you've lost 2/3 of viewers to start with. Garner and Co can be proud of their work in this film.It is vastly underrated and well worth seeing - especially for anyone such as I, who steered clear of the thing for twelve months - purely on word of mouth.If this was the worst film you ever saw in your life - man, you've had a good run!",Elektra
50,pyrocitor,Makes you wonder if even those involved had any idea of what was going on,3,16 February 2006,"It did seem pretty hard to imagine how a movie about female vigilante Elektra, taken from 2003's Daredevil could go seriously wrong - a strong, capable, leather-clad and very attractive female with a grudge goes and kicks some serious evil derrière. At the very worst, terribly clichéd, given how most modern action movies seem to revolve around or involve this formula. But, strangely enough, those responsible for the production of 'Elektra' managed to destroy this hard won formula most spectacularly, and the result is a tiresome muddle of half baked and unexplained nonsensical concepts, with no attempt at all at forming a cohesive and understandable plot. It's doubtful that screenwriters Zak Penn, Stuart Zicherman and Raven Metzner really had any cohesive idea of what was meant to happen in the film, as several aspects of the story seem to contradict each other in a befuddling fashion - as if their separate ideas were hastily compiled into a single, shoddy excuse for a screenplay. To be fair, this Elektra spin-off was one of the few sequels actually merited these days, as audiences anxiously awaited news of what exactly had happened to Elektra after she ""died""..? by the end. However, their questions of how exactly she survived and whether or not she was actually killed go sadly unanswered, the previous film only being referenced once in a brief, inconclusive sentence: ""I died once"". No further explanation or justification is given, which comes across as incredibly frustrating... though nowhere near as frustrating as the confusing, muddled excuse for a story is. Elektra's abilities seem to float in and out of the supernatural, as do those of her adversaries, and the reason for the film's main conflict (which is never at all clear in the first place) is also never explained. The film is a consistently jumbled series of question provoking scenes, which might have been great had the clever explanation the filmmakers keep hinting at eventually arrived. Don't be deceived by these expectations: it won't. In fact, don't expect anything in this story to make sense really, or you will be similarly disappointed.However, not absolutely everything in the film is terrible... there are some decently entertaining martial arts fight and training scenes, and Jennifer Garner seems to be trying so hard for the film not to be a flop that one begins to pity her - she seems to be trying to the extent of her ability, and indeed ends up giving an excellent performance in the end. It's only a pity this doesn't have nearly as much of an impact on the film as it should. Her ridiculously badly written ""love interest"" is given a decent characterisation by Goran Visnjic, and his daughter, who seems to mysteriously tie in with Elektra's conflict is played well enough by Kirsten Prout, although she comes off as whiny and annoying on many an occasion. However, there is an excellent cameo from Jason Isaacs at the start of the movie, and Terrance Stamp is great as the mysterious Stick, Elektra's mentor. Overall, I can hardly say that seeing Elektra is recommended in my books, unless the viewer is a die-hard fan of Jennifer Garner, or only interested in martial arts scenes, and not too picky about those insignificant things like plot or story. For everyone else... despite Jennifer Garner's best attempts, the movie is a confusing pile of rubbish, and it makes so little sense it borders on absurd. A major letdown - avoid at all costs, lest Hollywood think making more of such turgid movies is acceptable.-3/10",Elektra
51,BrandtSponseller,A superb but 'difficult' comic book film,10,27 January 2005,"Elektra (Jennifer Garner), a ""superhero hitperson"" when the film begins, is sent on a routine mission where she has to arrive a couple days early. Since the mission is in a relatively remote, pastoral island location, and she is renting a huge house by herself, she has time--too much time, she begins to feel--to reflect on her life. Contrary to her norm, she even becomes slightly friendly with neighbors. Shortly after, she is given the final, surprising, instructions for her hit, but she has second thoughts, choosing to protect her target instead. The plot concerns background of the hit, how and why Elektra protects the target, and becomes gradually more complex as other parties are revealed to be involved, too.My final score for Elektra was a 10 out of 10, but it wasn't easy getting there. Unlike most comic book movies, this is a ""difficult film"". The plot is complexly constructed, with nothing being spelled out very clearly until the viewer is far into the film. It also has a subtext hinging on moral ambiguity, making the film very gray, both literally and figuratively. Because things aren't explained well in the beginning, shortly into the film I had a sinking feeling that it might end up being a disaster. However, by the time you cross the finish line, the complex structure and context of the film are not only comprehensible, but also dazzling and necessary.As the narration in the beginning of the film states, this is a story set in a world where there are constant battles between good and evil, on many different levels, from large-scale wars to personal struggles within a single individual. This theme is woven throughout much of the film, leading to the moral ambiguity mentioned above, and even dictating the production design and cinematography. At the beginning of the film, Elektra is a hired assassin who makes no distinction between good and evil. Only later do we learn how she got to that point, and one of the overarching themes of the film is Elektra's redemption, which was put into motion with the aid of others, over many years, in ways that she (as well as the audience) does not realize until the end of the film. Although it would be easier for the audience to understand the film if Elektra's background were made explicit from the start, it wouldn't have the same eventual impact. In fact, it would tend to make the film more maudlin than what it is--a thought provoking moral exploration.The plot can also be seen as a metaphor for childhood dreams and parental investment and sacrifice for children, which are often shattered once innocence is lost and one has to deal with a pragmatic deflation of ambition and the often-brutal realities of the adult world. On this interpretation, it may be no coincidence that the ""bad guys"" are those who are still living in a magical reality, whereas the ""good guys"" are those who achieve spectacular results through years of learning and honing more down-to-earth skills.On a more superficial level, Elektra is a relatively fast-paced, fantasy-oriented actioner/thriller, loaded with suspense at the right moments, good performances, great direction, intriguing special effects and exciting fight scenes. I was particularly fascinated with the ""bad guys"" and their abilities, and also with Elektra's mentor. I'd love to see all of them explored more in other films (perhaps in a prequel of two to the events depicted here). I also hope we'll get sequels dealing more with Elektra and Abby Miller (Kirsten Prout).As a 10, of course Elektra is worth watching, but it's important to not be impatient with the film while watching it. It seems messy and maybe even slightly vacuous for the first 20 minutes or so, but that's because of a necessary angle of approach for accomplishing something unusual and valuable that couldn't otherwise be achieved.",Elektra
52,film-critic,Don't worry. Death's not that bad.,3,10 May 2005,"If there was an award handed out to the film with the most wasted potential, there would be several winners this year, but one of the runners up would be the film Elektra. While there were some decent action sequences coupled with some very impressive villains, it was ultimately the unrealistic story and constantly changing characters that will leave your head lost in the clouds. Throughout the film, Garner's character of Elektra is never defined. As often as the scenery changes in this film, as does Garner's portrayal of Elektra. One moment she is this heartless killer, and within a few short minutes, she is the most compassionate creature to be released by the comics. It literally made no sense. Who was she? What was her true purpose? Why (this is always a good question)? Was she looking for compassion and love? I have no clue, and this film took no effort to disclose the truth. Instead, we are forced to jump back and forth trying to decipher these basic elements that were never covered in this film. Couple with this some evil villains that were aesthetically pleasing to the eye, but that is all and you have the butchered comic release of Elektra.My initial thought about this film was that director Rob Bowman didn't do enough research on this character to correctly bring her to life. I have personally never read any of the comics, but I did see the film Daredevil, and I must admit Garner did provide the perfect opportunity to avoid looking at Ben Affleck, and I must say that I was interested in seeing how she was going to expand her character. Let me tell you how she did it  she took away any boundaries and borders. Garner created this character that floated through each scene without creating any substance. At one point she would be ruthless, then mere seconds later, Garner would show some sympathy towards one of the characters that would surpassingly seem out of character, because instantly she would transform back. There was no definition with her Elektra, which allowed for confusion and miscommunication to those involved in watching this film. Perhaps Garner wasn't quite comfortable in this role, or maybe the writing just didn't allow her to fully define herself. Whatever it was it transformed Garner from this encrypted character to just a fumbled mess of thoughts.With this said, one can also complain that this problem also occurred with the villains of this film. I was so excited to finally see colorful and purely evil villains, that my excitement slowly died upon witnessing nothing happening with them. There was no story, there was no moment of evil, there was nothing except a short glance of their faces followed by no lines coupled with impending death. These guys were tough, and they had some superhero powers that Garner didn't even acknowledge. It was yet again another glowing example of Rob Bowman not following through with the image of the comics and giving us ""dead"" characters. After witnessing the ""flip-floppery"" of Elektra, I wasn't expecting it from the villains, but somehow they just appeared. It then became apparent what Bowman had done wrong. His focus was not on Elektra or her arch-nemesis, but instead of the graphics that were being created. The story was weak, and I think Bowman knew that, so he spent a majority of his money on the CGI aspects of the film. Which, strangely, worked.I must give this film some credit, and that would be solely to the special effects crew. I thought visually this film was entertainment, but when you opened your ears, the remaining element just forced this film to crash and burn. Bowman knew how to make a visually appealing film, and he succeeded, but if he could have continued to add a very exciting and unfaltering story line, then he would have had a masterpiece. Instead, we are left with a horrible portrayal of Elektra by Garner, coupled with the cheesy Terrence Stamp moments that seem to all-so-well accompany the weakest, yet visually stunning, baddies this world has ever seen. It was just a hodge-podge of troubles, and at the helm was director Rob Bowman.Overall, I wasn't impressed at all. There were moments during this film where I thought it was going to go to a whole new level, but instead it just created a double negative effect. In essence, the ""fun"" scenes were canceled out by less important, nearly muted scenes. Garner tried, but ultimately failed as this superhero. She had the potential to really take this character to new levels, but thanks to the backward mind of Rob Bowman, she was unsuccessful. I truly believe that the focus in this feature was pointed in the wrong direction, do not give us the best camera shot known to man, but instead powerful characters and a believable (and less Hollywood) plot. This will give us a stronger character in the long run. The largest disappointment to this film was the characters that felt as if they were forgotten about. While I will never say that Daredevil was a better picture, but there are plenty of comic book films that do a better job of bringing their images to life. Skip this one and go see Sin City.Grade: ** out of *****",Elektra
53,brchthethird,A black spot on Marvel's track record,5,17 July 2015,"Even by pre-MCU standards, ELEKTRA is pretty bad. You have a nonsensical script, flat characters, uninspired dialogue, and equally bad delivery. DAREDEVIL was no prize, but this spin off failed in a large part to even be entertainingly bad. I can't really claim to know much about Elektra since I've never read any of the comics, but I have a hard time believing that the interpretation here was in any way faithful, except maybe cosmetically. If there's one thing the film has going for it, Jennifer Garner looks stunningly attractive in the character's trademark red costume. Even the filmmakers seem to be aware of this fact, as they spend an inordinate amount of screen time devoted to her movement in slow motion just looking sexy. Aside from some hackneyed backstory, though, Elektra is barely as fleshed out as the supporting cast around her. Even more to its detriment, no attempt is made whatsoever to explain anything whatsoever. The only thing that is clear is that The Hand is after some teenage girl who is ""The Treasure,"" and Elektra somehow gets caught in the middle of it. Other than that, it's the same old ""antihero who finds the good within themselves"" hokum that we've seen dozens of times already. But, one must give credit where credit is due. The production design and art direction on this film is pretty darn good. Costumes, sets, and effects were all done quite well. Even the action, though edited in a slightly irritating way, was effective enough. Too bad there wasn't more of it, though. The best scene is arguably Elektra's (re)introduction, but after that the pacing takes a nosedive and doesn't really recover until the last 30 minutes, and by then it's too late. Plenty of time is spent with Elektra and the two people she's originally tasked with killing, but the villains are left out in the cold as far as development is concerned. They all look cool and have some cool abilities, but their goal is ill-defined (as is the human MacGuffin they're after) and the actors playing them were risibly bad when they decided to open their mouths. If there's anything else to say to the film's detriment, it's that the pacing is so lethargic in the middle portion it becomes boring. When it comes down to it, I feel like only the Marvel completist would enjoy this in the slightest. Even as a DAREDEVIL apologist, I must say that ELEKTRA is non-essential when it comes to the Marvel canon. There is visual appeal to be had, but that's about it. Thank goodness the rights reverted back from Fox to Marvel Studios, because I feel like the Netflix DAREDEVIL show will finally get her right.",Elektra
54,jon.h.ochiai,"A Second Life, a Second Chance",7,6 February 2005,"""Elektra"" is a mess, and yet it stars the very hot Jennifer Garner in the title role. However, this frail story asks the captivating question: What do you do with a ""second life""? This actually saved the movie for me. Director Rob Bowman's ""Elektra"" follows the character Elektra, who died in the movie, ""Daredevil"". Yes, died. Elektra (Garner) is a ninja of great and legendary prowess. According to the mythology of the movie, she is also the balance between the forces of good and evil, in the quest for the Treasure-- the source of ultimate power. The comic book character created by Frank Miller, in the hands of screen writers, Zak Penn, Stu Zicherman, and Raven Metzner clumsily handles this intriguing premise. Garner is effective as Elektra, who is brought back from the dead, and is creating the path of her second life. The assassin for hire, Elektra, accepts an assignment from an undisclosed client, to kill widower Mark Miller (Goran Visnjic) and his daughter Abby (Kirsten Prout), who possesses a great secret. Not able to bring herself to kill them, she chooses instead to protect Mark and Abby, from The Order of the Hand, a powerful Ninja Clan. What follows is battle against great evil, in a very murky and convoluted story.Elektra is much too dour for Garner, rather this wastes the innate lightness and charm which she displayed in ""13 Going on 30"". Garner to her credit is a strong and charismatic force, and a true physical screen presence. She looks awesome. Her fight sequences, when not overly edited, are very impressive. She obviously trained intensely in the martial arts for the movie. It is a shame that the story does not adequately support her. Having her character suffer from obsessive compulsive disorder is a curious touch for character complexity. An unexpected saving grace is Terence Stamp as Elektra's ""gaijin"" Sensei, Stick. In a flashback, Stick points out to Elektra that she is his most powerful student, but not his best student. The point being that Elektra has a good soul, but has chosen a dark path. Stick is the one who asks, ""What do you do with a second life?"" Elektra eventually asks Stick for help in protecting the Millers. But it is Elektra, alone, who must face the evil forces of The Hand. Even amidst the over done, aerial wire fighting sequences, the notion that our warrior Elektra chooses to protect life, instead of taking it, is noble. Granted this is not always clear in this movie, but it is well intentioned.""Elektra"" is a very glossy mess that to it's credit has it's moments. The movie is really saved by a noble premise. Jennifer Garner is an absolutely hot star, who has a commanding screen presence. Though ""Elektra"" for the most part, wastes her gifts. Hopefully and mercifully, there will not be a sequel.",Elektra
55,DarthBill,"Simply terrible - worse than ""Daredevil"".",1,27 July 2005,"Elektra (a still miscast Jennifer Garner) comes back to life, resurrected by General Zod- I mean, Terrence Stamp, in the role of Stick, who is actually the mentor of Daredevil/Matt Murdock in the comic books, trains Elektra a little more in the art of assassination, then sends her away as part of some plot to get their hands on a girl who's a chosen one of some sort. And there are a bunch of magic wielding ninjas thrown into the mix as well.True, ""Daredevil"" wasn't particularly good, but even in its worst moments it wasn't nearly as bad as this piece of crap. I don't know why everyone keeps talking about how great Jennifer Garner is in this movie - she's absolutely terrible. Not only was she one of the worst parts of the Daredevil film, she is by far the worst thing about this Elektra spin-off. Tall and lean she may be, but there's still an essence of all American girl next door about her (despite her somewhat masculine face, complete with hollow cheeks and square jawline), even though the comic book Elektra was a dark, sensual, exotic, foreign beauty. Miss Garner is about exotic as a chocolate chip cookie. Making things worse is that Jennifer Garner has no intensity or authority whatsoever. She's not imposing, she's not commanding, she's just a whole lot of nothing. She doesn't show any hint of a personality; it looks like she's been studying acting from the Star Wars prequels. Her relationship with the chosen girl, Abby, is just laughable, as is her ""romance"" with the girl's father.After that, the film's plot is just so poorly written and conceived it's amazing it ever got green lit, with unimpressive villains and boring characters all around. It's harder and harder to figure out what's going on in the heads of studio execs and directors these days.Jason Isaacs has a cameo in the opening as some random guy Elektra kills, and he delivers his lines so poorly that you'd swear he was being dubbed by someone else.Do yourselves a favor and read the comics instead.",Elektra
56,juliankennedy23,Red Bustier? At least Daredevil had an excuse.... he was blind.,4,8 May 2005,"Elektra: 4/10: When people said Jennifer Garner, as Elektra, was the best thing in the movie Daredevil. I'm pretty sure they were mostly damning with faint praise. After all Jennifer, while certainly an attractive female, came across as a sorority pledge playing dress-up on S and M rush night. In Elektra she looks even more ridiculous. There have been plenty of great female assassins over the years from the camp of a Bond villain, to the seductiveness of Linda Fiorentino, even the girl next-door deadliness of Bridget Fonda in Point of No Return. Female assassins are a wonderful staple of filmdom, seductive yet deadly. Garner is neither. ""She looks like she is thinking of puppies,"" claimed one reviewer I read and I concur. If the Smurfs were X-rated ninja's, then Garner would still be miscast in Smurfette: Deadly Blue.Her costumes certainly don't help her cause. You almost have the urge to tell her to put some clothes on and bright red Victoria Secret lingerie just doesn't scream stealth or deadly. Lord knows the rest of this mess doesn't help Garner either. While Terrance Stamp can do no wrong every else seems either miscast or afraid of stealing Garner's thunder. Add on poor special effects, villains that turn into family friendly yellow smoke when killed, ninjas that crash through windows like Army rangers, gas stoves that explode like nuclear weapons, laundry fu, Japanese villains out of a World War 2 propaganda film and my personal favorite the warmest Christmas in Canadian history. The movie clearly takes place in the northwest United States or Vancouver. The days are long, everyone is in short sleeves, and Garner takes recreational swims in the lake. (Canadian Lakes are notoriously cold even in August mind you) So when a cherub faced character asks Garner over for Christmas dinner Elektra isn't the only one surprised.Garner is sexy but when it's time to kill she should either get dressed or let the grown-ups take care of things.",Elektra
57,eminkl,"Not stupid enough to qualify as good, dumb fun.",2,1 September 2019,"Daredevil's sai-wielding assassin Elektra, I could have sworn, was somewhat dead the last time we saw her. No matter, because this time out she's got the great Terence Stamp, as Stick, on her side, the Mr. Miyagi to her Karate Kid redux. Garner's Elektra was, frankly, the best thing about the turgid Daredevil, unless you were a fan of Ben Affleck's ridiculously form-fitting crime fightin' duds (which left so little to the imagination it was as if Tom of Finland had been hired for costume design). That said, this resoundingly unaffecting solo show has precious little going for it other than Stamp, who, since his comeback turn in Steven Soderbergh's The Limey, has been nothing less than a godsend to whatever film he happens to turn up in. Here, Elektra is offered $2 million to take out Mark Miller (Visnjic) and his 11-year-old daughter Abby (Prout), but, as so often happens in the Marvel Universe, the kid is the Chosen One, the savior of humanity, and Elektra ends up defending the pair against the Order of the Hand, a mysterious Asian league of evil headed by Yun Lee's sword-wielding Kirigi (accompanied, natch, by a group of henchmen with names like Typhoid, Stone, and Tattoo). Elektra suffers mainly from a poorly constructed script, which tosses in everything but the kitchen sink and then fails to do much of anything with the myriad plot developments that occur. There are a few chaste nuzzles between Elektra and Mark, but the heat never blossoms to flame. Much is made, in flashbacks, of Elektra's obsessive youthful training at the hands of her stern father, but the psychological ramifications of what it means to become a killer like Elektra are then barely explored. Garner's turn in the consistently intriguing Alias is proof she knows her way around a comic-book world, but the lack of any real sense of who or what this character is, or even why she's chosen to become an assassin in the first place, stymies the film on a cellular level. Much of this could be ignored, possibly, if the film's action set-pieces were revelatory, but no, they're not. Director Bowman shoots things with the sort of busy camerawork that makes you wonder if he's trying to ape Tsui Hark's wild actioneering or if he's trying to avoid it entirely. I'm still not sure which it is, but watching Elektra turn somersaults over her foes in her drop-dead-sexy assassin's gear isn't remotely as invigorating as it by all rights ought to be. There have been worse Marvel Comics adaptations in recent memory - The Punisher was a nadir unfathomable to most human beings, and Pitof's astonishingly goofy Catwoman rivals anything Ray Dennis Steckler ever did for sheer inanity - which leaves Elektra in the unfortunate position of simply being, perhaps, not stupid enough to qualify as good, dumb fun, a situation for which there can be no answer then but ""So what?""",Elektra
58,gigan-92,A Failed production on So many Aspects,4,27 January 2011,"Of all the action films I have seen, this is one of the worst. I'm actually familiar with Rob Bowman's work, a lot of which is still very flawed but somewhat enjoyable. But this movie fail so epically on many levels. Jennifer Garner once again plays the role so opposite to the actual character, worse than she did in ""Dare Devil"" actually. Elektra does close to nothing in this movie, and the over all amount of actual action is pathetic. I came in expecting big and extravagant fight scenes coupled with impressive martial arts, but we don't get anything even close to that.The storyline is predictable worse yet and the characters are incredibly bland. We are occasionally thrown some interesting visuals, but it is all negated by, yes, even a terrible score.

59,Bogmeister,The Saga of the Lady Assassin Goes on,5,27 January 2006,"There's always a danger with these offshoot pictures (spun off from ""Daredevil"",'03 in this case) that the character which worked fine as part of an ensemble will not succeed on his/her own. Elektra should have worked out fine; if only they'd written her into a more compelling tale. Garner obviously has star quality, still in that ""Alias"" TV series while filming this. She's quite morose in the first half, having been killed, reborn, and skulking in the dark shadows as a premiere assassin (this is all very briefly displayed and an expanded version might exist later). The problem is that a main character in perennial sulk does not translate into interesting characterization. Things appear to perk up when she reaches the turning point in the story - there's a line she won't cross as far as the killing goes - but the viewer is rewarded by little more than a simplistic chase plot and a 'big sister/little sister' bonding subplot.Admitedly, those doing the chasing are not without interest; there's more than a resemblance to some or any team of super-villains from the comic books. Each evil member has his own specialty or super-power, all devoted to the art of killing, of course. I was a little disappointed in the leader, Kirigi, who seemed too young and lacked a gravitas to match his formidable abilities. It all wrapped up rather quickly in that maze and I was also puzzled by the ineffectiveness of the poisonous female villain, whose mere presence kills plants but can't cause death to the girls after prolonged contact. You keep waiting for something really interesting to happen and it never does, a 'by the motions' approach of the director. Terence Stamp is pretty good as the elder teacher Stick in his few scenes (taken from the Daredevil comic book). It's curious that the rare major motion picture with a female comic book heroine was this, based on a late entry in the comics mythos, rather than another, such as Black Widow, She-Hulk, or even from the competition, Wonder Woman. The fact it didn't do well at the box office was probably predestined - remember ""Supergirl"" from'84?",Elektra

The story is terribly shallow, no point and leading nowhere, and no characteristic. Very disappointing. The things that are importances are left unattended but some silly stuff keep on repeating. The characters are very shallow, plus a sub-plot of romance between Elektra and Mark is totally unnecessary.The only right thing in this movie seems to be the CGI, which have been done rather good. The directing is not so bad but with this shitty screenplay to work it doesn't seem quite working either. Though Elektra might be sizzling hot in her crimson red dress it doesn't go with the flow with the movie at all. It looks like women in her bra try to fight all the bad guys.

61,raypdaley182,Over rated,1,15 October 2005,"Very bad indeed. During the scenes where Jennifer Garner is dressed in her red Elektra costume there are certain angles where she facially looks like a very badly made-up drag queen. A very harsh chin and jawline making her look very masculine indeed. Almost as if a lot of her scenes were being shot by a man in very bad make-up.The Chinese wire fighting was truly awful. What may have helped this film a little would have been a nice huge caveat stating ""No reality was attempted during the filming of this picture"". I normally hate that kind of fighting and previously hated films like House of Flying Daggers & Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.The girl playing Abby was obviously chosen to look a little like a young version of Elektra. The head of the rogue faction of the hand gang did not look old enough to have been the man who killed Elektra's mother. I could only assume that at least 15 years had passed between the death of her mother and the final conflict back at their house.Terrance Stamp is totally miscast as the Sensei but his voice is instantly recognizable at the start of the film. This truly could have done with more back story, setting up Elektra's credentials as an assassin. The little inset at the start was not enough. The whole set-up about the death of Elektra's mother was not filled out enough. We are never really told why (and if we are, it is NOT explained clearly enough for my liking).The baddies are good but not given enough to do.

It would have been nice to get a bit of background story as to Elektra's revival early on but of this we are only feed glimpses during the course of the movie.The same goes for the reason The Hand is after the young girl and her father. We are told that she is special during the course of the movie but we never get much of a real background story or any real incitement to understand or care about what happens to them other than that they are nice people and The Hand are the bad guys.Still the movie is not entirely without merits. I quite liked Terence Stamp as the old Ninja master. The fighting is reasonably enjoyable. The fight scene with all the sheets of cloth floating around is quite beautiful even though Elektra gives a bit out of control impression in it.

There is no development at all. Not with the plot or the characters.There are a few characters from the comics added in, and they were translated horribly. The character of Elektra's trainer, Stick, is almost completely pointless.

67,Danny_G13,Forgettable nonsense,5,14 July 2005,"Pseudo-follow up to Daredevil is vacuous and shallow, devoid of anything worthwhile.Jennifer Garner reprises her Daredevil role as Elektra, in a movie exclusively dedicated to her (And completely unrelated to the first film). She's been brought back to life by some Oriental technique called Kemagurai practised on her by her subsequent sensai. She now spends her time as a paid assassin carrying out random jobs given to her by her agent McCabe.Without any friends or family, Elekra is a pretty empty empty person and was expelled from her martial arts school by aforementioned sensai as all he could see in her was raw anger and violence, instilled in her as a young girl when her mother was murdered.However, when her latest assignment sees her sent to Japan (I believe) she encounters a father and daughter while she's waiting for her actual mission to begin, and gets to know them. Suddenly the direction her life is taking seems to be shifting slightly...Elektra is a time killer and nothing more. It's instantly forgettable, and while the movie is expectedly polished, style does not precede substance. The story is wafer thin, and many of the situations are quite laughably contrived.Garner, again, possesses all the charisma of a teabag, which, deliberate or not, fails to ingratiate her to the audience at all. The character is certainly overly deadpan, and while this may be fair enough and faithful to the comic book, it's slightly nauseating in film form.The movie, as a result, while broken up with the odd moment of humour, takes itself insanely seriously, much more so than any such film should. Hulk was also guilty of this, but Elektra's original movie outing, Daredevil, was quite capable of effective humour. This film could do with learning from that.How can you take an unbelievable movie seriously if it can't laugh at itself? The direction is decent enough, and the fight scenes are actually a lot less confusing than they generally are in this type of movie. The acting is bland, which is to be expected, and the overall cheese level at times hits a factor of 100.It's pure fodder, and absolute drivel.

Doomed character, who is her target, explains how Elektra works, and of course, she pretty much does the exact same thing to this character, which the character was explaining to his henchman! Wow. Huge surprise! But, it was kind of a decent enough introduction. Then the film gets boring, as we see Garner being mysteriously hired, and heads to some house on the beach. She has flashbacks of her mentor in Styx (Terence Stamp). A notorious group called The Hand, led by some nobody who is super-fast wants a certain someone dead, and Elektra decides to protect that certain someone! The villains in general are lame! Typhoid Mary really wasn't utilised as the powerhouse she is, and not to mention, her exit was lame. The visual effects were okay in parts, but not that great, and the fight sequences were pretty stock-standard- nothing exceptional. I didn't expect much from 'Elektra', and pouting Garner didn't add much to this anti-hero at all. Makes me realise I was a little too harsh on 'DareDevil', as it is a much better film with better characters and villains. I guess, in 'Elektra's' defense, it's better than 'Catwoman'! I know that's not much of a defense.** out of *****!",Elektra
70,squirrel_burst,"""Elektra"" Makes ""Ghost Rider"" look like ""Spider-Man 2""",2,13 April 2015,"Move over ""Ghostrider""; ""Elektra"" is now the worst Marvel movie to come out of the 2000's. It's a total disappointment on every single level and even if you're a hardcore fan of the character from the comic books, there is no way you will be able to forgive the slew of continuous cinematic sins this movie brings to your screen.If you remember the end of ""Daredevil"", our titular character (played by Jennifer Garner) had been killed, much to our hero's chagrin. Just before the credits, there were hints that maybe she wasn't dead, despite the fact that she got a sai (those swords she wields) through her chest. Even if you don't remember any of that stuff, it doesn't really matter because this picture has little, if anything to do with that first movie. Elektra is now a crazy ninja assassin who is ""deep"" because she feels no remorse about killing people and does so a bit excessively; or sometimes doesn't. After being sent to assassinate a man (Goran Visnjic as Mark) and his teenage daughter (Kirsten Prout as Abby) Elektra decides to toss out her assignment and protect them from the evil clan of ninjas called ""The Hand"" instead.I had an epiphany during this movie. It made me realize why this, and other notoriously poor comic book movies like ""Ghost Rider"" and ""Catwoman"" suck so much. It's because they have totally lame villains. Let's say you were making a Batman movie. Who would you have him pitted against? Would it be villains that no one has ever heard of, that even comic book fans don't care about like ""Chemical King"", ""Hellhound"", ""Killshot"" and ""Rip Roar""? No way! Not in a million years! What you would do is pick one, maybe two and make sure they're some of the most interesting, most iconic criminals in Gotham City. Guys like The Joker, or Two-Face, or Bane. Characters that couldn't possibly be mistaken for anyone else, have a ton of personality and feel like genuine threats because their reputation precedes them. With that in mind, who is Elektra pitted against in this story? A bunch of no-name, Z-grade baddies that are totals chumps and that no one will ever remember, or care about. We have Boob lady, who can make stuff decay, sometimes; Big black guy who is bullet proof and strong; their boss who has generic ninja powers and a guy with killer tattoos (he's actually kind of cool admittedly). After doing a bit of research, I realized that these characters, which are about as appealing as the popcorn you find under your seat cushions are actually previously established characters from the Marvel universe. Boob lady (Natassia Malthe) is Typhoid, the strong guy (Bob Sapp) is Stone, their leader (Will Yun Lee) is Kirigi and some of the other characters introduced throughout include Stick, and some ninja clans that fans of Daredevil and Elektra will recognize.The problem is that none of these villains have powers that feel original. We've seen strong guys before; we've seen people that can make people go moldy before. If not in other superhero movies, then in generic action films that require a supernatural villain (which is what this feels like). I did think that at least one of the villains in this film was cool, which was Tattoo (Chris Ackerman). Basically he can bring the ink on his body to life to spy on people with spiders, or birds or even use them offensively by unleashing the wolf or snake tattoos. Even then though, this character never really feels like a genuine threat because he doesn't use his powers in any inventive ways and when he goes down, you'll go ""wait, that's it?!"" Notice how little I've actually talked about the movie? That's because ""Elektra"" is about as generic as it gets. Jennifer Garner jumps around in a sexy outfit looking tough, nobody uses guns because guns are too effective in terms of assassinating people, you get your teenage sidekick, characters that make idiotic decisions so that we can have action sequences, and the acting is lousy. In terms of performances, the worst offender has to be Terence Stamp as Stick. He's supposed to be blind, but you couldn't tell from the way he's always looking at the person he's talking to. It's like they didn't even try to make it convincing! This film only lasts a little bit over an hour and a half and it felt like it was taking forever to conclude. There is nothing interesting going on here. Even the combat sequences couldn't jar me out of my state of nearly-dead-out-of-boredom because the villains suck and the way they're taken down isn't interesting. It doesn't make Elektra look good when she effortlessly takes down a slew of stereotypical black-clad ninjas, it just makes these shinobi look like a bunch of pajama-wearing losers. If you can't predict where this plot is going, by the way you haven't seen any action movies because this doesn't feel like a superhero or comic book movie at all. They don't even refer to Daredevil or anything! This movie is clearly as sequel-spin off of the Ben Affleck flick (whose ""Director's Cut"" is solid and very enjoyable) but the only hint of this is an afterthought during the first five minutes of the running time.At least ""Ghost Rider"" had some cool visuals, with Johnny Blaze running around with a flaming skull for a head. This movie has got absolutely nothing to offer. None of the characters are compelling, none of the action is exciting, none of the writing is original. Even if you were the world's biggest Elektra fan, I can assure you that this is not a worthy representation of her comic book iterations. I can't think of anyone I could recommend it to, but it didn't offend me so I can't quite give it a zero rating. It's close though. (Director's Cut on Blu-ray, March 28, 2015)",Elektra
71,jpintar,Watchable but forgettable,6,14 January 2005,"Elektra is a watchable but ultimately forgettable comic book adaptation. This is a spin off of the underrated Daredevil movie. Jennifer Garner is once again very good as Elektra. I also liked seeing Terrence Stamp, who I will always remember as General Zod in Superman II, again and he is also good. I also liked the father and daughter that unintentionally get involved in Elektra's world of assassination. So why isn't this movie better? The movie contains yet another evil secret society that we have seen several times before. The fight scenes seem to be shot on fast forward. Even at 96 minutes, the movie does go on much longer than it needs to. The likable heroes make this movie watchable, but don't expect anything special. I give it a 6/10 and I know I am going to be one of the more generous ones.",Elektra
72,rparham,A weak vehicle,5,23 April 2005,"In the realm of recent comic book adaptation films, Elektra is one of the more lackluster to find it's way to the screen. Technically a competent film, Elektra is, however, without much excitement and energy; it's just sort of there.Elektra is, essentially, a spin-off from the film Daredevil. Elektra (Jennifer Garner) was introduced there as the love interest of Ben Affleck's Matt Murdock, aka Daredevil, who was killed by the assassin Bullseye (Colin Farrel). Here, she has been resurrected by a martial arts master named Stick (Terrence Stamp) and, after being trained by him for a time, is pushed into the outside world because she is unable to manage her aggressive nature. She takes up the only career she seems to be good at, assassination, and builds a strong reputation and even an agent (Colin Cunningham). She is offered a job at a small island, where she befriends a father, Mark Miller (Goran Visnjic) and his daughter, Abby (Kirsten Prout). It is shortly after getting to know them that she discovers that they are her targets, but she is unable to follow the job and instead decides to protect them from the forces pursuing them: an ancient organization of evil known as the Hand. Elektra quickly realizes that Abby is the ""Treasure,"" a martial arts prodigy and the Hand, led by Kirigi (Will Yun Lee), want her for themselves.Elektra has a number of problems, but it starts with a rather blank and emotionless lead. Jennifer Garner is certainly a capable actress, but she isn't given much of an opportunity to shine here. Her Elektra is supposed to be going through an awakening to her emotions again, but the film doesn't really give us much of an opportunity to care about her. It also tries to create a relationship between Elektra and Mark, but this is just thrown in for good measure, and there is the slightest spark between them. Visnjic is here for the ride, and that is it.Elektra also has an enormously weak slate of villains. Kirigi is nothing special, and his henchmen, each with a different power, are okay, but most of them don't last long enough to make an impression. They aren't terribly menacing and therefore we can't be too worried about what they are going to do. Action wise, Elektra is also nothing to write home about. There are a few fights, and the visual effects utilized are well integrated into the film, but there is nothing much impressive on display here. The script is also rather undefined as to what the ""treasure"" exactly means. Why is everyone so interested in her? What will she provide to them? Lacking a strong hero, a strong villain or a coherent plot, there isn't much to recommend Elektra. My advice: rent Spider-Man 2 instead if you are looking for a good comic book adaptation.",Elektra
73,AwesomeWolf,Nothing happening here...,4,4 September 2005,"Elektra, or, as I know her, ""that chick from Daredevil who turned up in Wolverine's solo book once or twice"". So, 'Daredevil' wasn't THAT bad. It served me well as mild entertainment once or twice. I figured that 'Elektra' might also pass as amusing - after all, it promised to be about ninjas, and I do love a good ninja movie.After carking it in 'Daredevil', Elektra (Jennifer Garner) is brought back by her master Stick (Terence Stamp). She becomes an assassin for hire, but while on an assignment, she becomes fond of her supposed targets Mark Miller (Goran Visnjic) and his thirteen year old daughter Abby (Kirsten Prout), and decides to protect from the Hand, a shadowy underworld organization of ninjas with freaky powers. Led by Kirigi (Will Yun Lee), a small group of the Hand's elite set out to finish Elektra's job and Elektra too.Woah, so I never thought a movie all about good ninjas and bad ninjas involved in some sort of ninja war could be so boring. 'Elektra' turned out to be a character-driven ninja movie, instead of a ninja-driven ninja movie. I don't mind a non-action movie every so often, but 'Elektra' was presented a full on action movie, and that was all I wanted in the middle of doing university assignments and studying for tests. Basically, it followed the same style as 'Hulk', but was less exciting.Jennifer Garner spends long periods of the film standing around looking bored, and generally giving out a performance one might usually expect from someone like Steven Seagal. Her Elektra was much more interesting in 'Daredevil' than in 'Elektra'. Despite an entire film about her, you really don't learn anything about the character: At one point Abby mentions that Elektra has OCD, but it just seems pointless and is never referred to again. The other characters get shafted too: Elektra's apparent love interest makes very little impact on the movie, and all we know about the villains is that they are ninjas with freaky powers. No explanation, no origin, nothing.There is barely enough action in 'Elektra' to even qualify as an action. Much of the time wasted on following the character's around as they do nothing could have been used to beef up 'Elektra' as an action film. As it stands, they were pretty ordinary and almost nowhere to be seen. I mean, a few more extended fight scenes could have made 'Elektra' amusing at least.'Elektra' isn't as terrible as Marvel's 'Nick Fury' movie, but it doesn't come close to some of Marvel's more awesome movies, like 'The Punisher'. At best, 'Elektra' is barely average: very little happens - 4/10",Elektra
74,smellthecult-com-1,None 'super' hero,4,15 October 2009,"Here's the thing: All of my knowledge of comic book superheroes comes from movie adaptations. Though a raging geek as a youngster (and to this day), comic book appreciation passed me by. Indeed, I had no idea a character called Elektra even existed in the Marvel world until this movie was announced and, truthfully, if I had gone to my grave in ignorance, I don't think I'd have missed much. Jennifer 'Alias' Garner plays the eponymous heroine, a woman with a troubled past and a heavy heart. She is an assassin, willing to work for the highest bidder, though she seems to have some form of moral code. Hired to protect a father and his teenage daughter from a ruthless group of fellow assassins, the father / daughter team have a few surprises of their own. And here lies the problem: Elektra herself doesn't seem to have any extraordinary powers of her own, apart from the ability to fight really well. Granted, that may well be pretty useful, but it's hardly extraordinary. Amir Khan can fight pretty well. Jackie Chan can fight pretty well. Christ, my mate Gaz can fight pretty well when he's got a few beers inside him, but that doesn't make him a superhero. Elektra's only claim to the superhero tag seems to be her shock-red costume, specially designed to maximise cleavage. And it's dull, too. Feeling more like a TV episode than a genuine cinematic event, this is something of a damp squib all round and, in Rob Bowman, they have a director on board who is more than adept at shooting TV shows, but the step up to the big screen seems too much of a stretch. Forgettable and tedious, one to avoid superhero fans.",Elektra
75,BigGuy,Not so bad,6,15 January 2005,"I read and heard a lot of negative things about this movie before going in. While I am not saying it is a great movie, it is definitely a fun popcorn movie. The characters, dialog, and story are a bit over the top, but this is a comic book movie. If you go in expecting more than a comic book movie, you will likely be disappointed.So the story is that Elektra turns into an assassin after getting kicked out of good guy martial arts school. She ends up returning to the good side and helping out a young girl and the girl's father. The bad guys are ""The Hand"". They send assassins and then they send a goon squad with super powers.My main complaint is getting to be my standard complaint with action movies, that the action is often not visible. Shaky cams, too tight zooms, and quick edits disguise the action. Also, I would have loved a larger role Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa who is one of my favorite bad guys of all time.",Elektra

The story don't make sense and they're a lot of plot holes. It's boring to me. I like Daredevil (2003) but this spin off fails but I didn't watch the director's cut so I might watch the director's cut of Electra. I don't recommend this film at all.Score: 2.5/10,Elektra
77,lotus_chief,One of the worst movies I've ever seen.....honestly!,1,22 January 2005,"I'm gonna lay it out like this: don't let the 'fake' reviews here on IMDb fool you, the critics got it right for a change. As I type this, rottentomatoes.com has Elektra rated at 7 PERCENT; 107 counted - 7 fresh and 100 rotten. There was no way in hell I was paying to see this, I just wanted to see how bad it was. Believe me, its bad. REALLY bad. Special effects aside, the movie plain sucks.Now I'm not at all familiar with Jennifer Garner, but she just doesn't do it for me here; she's not at all convincing as a martial arts expert/assassin. The story is very spotty. We never find out anything about 'the treasure' (the little girl), how she became such, why her mother was killed, what her father's purpose was...none of it. They never explain why Elektra has OCD, if she really does, or why The Hand killed her mother. The bad guys, 'The Hand' may seem cool when they're introduced, but you'd never think they were considering how easily Elektra disposes of them. Whatever happened to a good old meaningful fight scene? The black guy in the group who supposedly has impenetrable skin (of course he was the first of the crew to die), damages a tree that Elektra was on, only for it to fall on him and he dies??? Elektra can throw her sai through a forest practically from a football field away and hit dead on? Even better: the one guy in the crew, the leader, could whoop Elektra's ass showing complete dominance, only to be killed in the simplest of moves?? Or how about how easy she disposes of Tattoo? For them to build up The Hand as such a force to be reckoned with and show Elektra as troubled, having not fully mastered her craft...that doesn't completely add up when Elektra basically kills them off as easily as breathing.This movie basically fails at every level. For an action film it's not very exciting, because the makers thwart every potential tense moment as soon as they initiate its build-up. Garner was horribly miscast here, I was not able to feel her in this role at ALL. The bad guys end up being cheap 'foot soldier' bad guys who are made to look cool but essentially serve no real purpose. At least other comic book films gave some back-story into the character being featured, and a clear stance on what the point of the story was, but Elektra was just too lazy to do so. One of the worst films I've seen in a while.1/2* out of **** stars.",Elektra
78,mirwais-orbit,I feel bad for 3 stars but...,3,26 August 2007,"When I noticed that Jennifer would be playing Elektra again in an own Elektra movie I thought that it would be a brilliant idea because cinema should do this kind spin-off things more frequently because it's a wonderful idea to innovate old ideas in a time so poor of innovations. The trailer was awesome and the previews were being amazing. Jennifer's interviews were exciting and she was a lot confident about the final results because she once said about all the responsibilities on her back and she wouldn't like to mess with Elektra fans.Well, if I could, I would redo that movie and I would pay millions for Jennifer play the role again. Jennifer did an amazing job for the character and she played her part well, but we cannot say the same thing about the writers, producers and director. People were a lot nice with Jennifer not blaming her for the flop because people could see that the problem wasn't her. There is something strange about this movie... it starts well but suddenly it becomes a huge piece of crap and nonsense. That's evident just by watching it that a lot of scenes were deleted and the final screenplay was a lot different from the original... looks like that scenes were deleted from the last minute during edition and that the original screenplay was modified during screen-shots by studio bosses that were not liking that Elektra-bad-ass attitude that is shown in the beginning.Abby's characters is a lot unnecessary, who knows Elektra would never imagine that she would be defending a child. God... Elektra could kill a child! She's a cold blood assassin and she's completely moved by her instinct and sense of revenge and never for her emotions, and her personality in the movie is quite different from the comics. Her personality is almost the same from the comics just at the beginning of the movie when she kills everybody with no remorse and when she's being strong and a lot invincible. Then, after 30 minutes of movie, she becomes fragile and fragile, almost dying with the plot to a point that you can only recognize Elektra by her red outfit and she's so weak to a point that a kick in her chest is enough to defeat her. That's silly!She was almost dead a lot of times during entire movie for what?We can understand that this movie is a story after the incidents over Daredevil and she's not a fighting expert yet but her experience and strong comes together with her sense of revenge, revenge and blood is the only thing that takes over her mind, that's what makes Elektra so close to Catwoman and that's what makes both characters so interesting and rich because they're not villains and they're not heroes.That's a very sad movie. I was disappointed when I saw it and I wanted to cry a lot and kill everybody behind this movie for destroying such an awesome character.",Elektra
79,oshram-3,"Bland, mildly enjoyable film",4,8 April 2005,"While I was kinder to Daredevil (2003) than it deserved, I frankly didn't expect a spin-off before a sequel. One of the weakest points of Daredevil was, in fact, Elektra, so from a quality standpoint it surprises me that they gave her a film of her own. From a marketing standpoint, it makes total sense; Jennifer Garner is still hot, and while films about female heroes haven't been shattering box office records, they're more accepted now than they were even five years ago.The problem with an Elektra film, or at least this one, is that it fails to answer the central question: who is Elektra and why should we care about her? She's not the same free-spirited if slightly troubled girl Matt Murdock fell in love with in his film. She's certainly not the Elektra Natchios in the comic, who, to paraphrase her creator Frank Miller ""isn't a bad girl with a heart of gold; she's just a bad girl,"" (and I won't even dignify the fashion-ad whore currently posing as Elektra in the Marvel Universe). But the film never can decide who she is either. She's certainly haunted -- though death can do that to a girl -- but she's neither as hard as the script needs her to be, nor as soft. I don't know if that's a failing of Garner's acting, the direction, or the script, or more likely a combination of the three. Elektra seems to vacillate between being a committed hard ass of the Sarah Conner school and being a normal chick. When she spouts the line, ""I'm a soccer mom,"" the irony needed for the humor just isn't there, because, well, Elektra, frankly, you're not the hard ass you need to be to make that line funny.Most of the rest of the film wrestles with indecision too. The villains, while interesting, have no connection to one another (their powers don't even complement; one is a brick, one can summon animals from his tattoos, one is a poison ivy type, and so on), and it's just as hard to root for them as it is to root for the confused heroine. You want to like Elektra, and Garner sort of gives it a try, but there's not enough there to. Ditto with pretty much everyone in the film -- you get the idea that in competent hands this might have been a decent film.Elektra has three main problems. First, it really plays like a sequel to a movie we haven't seen. There are references to things that we aren't told about, and everyone is carrying on as if this is the second film. There's precious little origin material, and the only 'secret' from her past is a dead giveaway. Secondly, the film's not really about Elektra (in much the same way Red Sonja wasn't really about her, either). The film is really about a little girl, Abby (Kristin Prout), who's next in line to be the chosen one, blah blah blah. So apparently now Elektra is sort of like a slayer, and when she pops it this girl takes over. Joy. The third problem is, while she's not as bad as you would fear, Jennifer Garner is just not right for the role of a tortured, conflicted Greek assassin. I know, she plays the modern version of La Femme Nikita on TV, and that's all Hollywood can see, but she just never fits comfortably in the role, and what's more, it seems like she knows that too. She'd do in a Jerry Bruckheimer film about stealing the Declaration or whatever, but here, she just doesn't work very well. A more appropriate actress for the role could have helped the film somewhat (though I doubt she could have overcome the other flaws).Elektra is not a bad film; it's mediocre, neither distastefully bad nor engagingly good. There's some nice eye candy (the effects with the tattoo animals are pretty good, Typhoid Mary (Natassia Malthe) has a certain presence, and Terence Stamp is fun as ornery blind 'sensei' Stick). The fight scenes are 'eh,' even though they borrow at the end from HK cinema and at least try to give us an interesting duel in a hall of falling sheets. But the lack of forethought in the script, the lack of focus on the main character, and the decision to try and make a movie that looked cool rather than had any weight or made much sense weakened it from the start. Elektra is lightweight entertainment for a rainy evening, but nothing more. Here's hoping they come to their senses and leave it at one film and don't try to build a franchise out of it.",Elektra
80,Dragoneyed363,An insanely fun and enticing movie,9,26 June 2008,"I have never really understood all the dislike for Elektra. In my opinion, it was wonderful entertainment and complete fun to watch. All the action was awesome, and the script was very different and very interesting. Now, I never read the comic books to Marvel movies so I have no idea what people might be getting at on that level, but even if I did, I would try to see the movie on two perspectives: How it works as an adaptation and how it works as a movie itself. Surely this one conjured up enough points in one or both for you to consider it decent at best. I like it way more than Daredevil.This movie however by itself was great to me without having knowledge of the history, and even though there were a few problems with it, overall it was pretty flawless as far as how much it had my eyes glued on the screen. It really does so I guess because Jennifer Garner is a pleasure to watch on screen, always has been for me, and I love her in this role. I guess some people going in to expect this to have something to do with Daredevil would be a little disappointed as it only relates by the title character, as people were with the 2004 Catwoman and Batman, but I am simply tired of all the negativity on female superhero films of the 00s that deserve more appreciation.",Elektra
81,jrfranklin01,Not A Prequel,3,30 April 2005,"I was under the impression this film might be on the prequel-frenzy that others were, but I can assure you that isn't the case. ""Elektra"" is actually something of a sequel to ""Daredevil"" where she plays a love interest that is slain by the villain, Bullseye. But don't expect to seen Ben Affleck even though he is in one of the deleted scenes. This movie is solely about the heroine played by Jennifer Garner. She is resurrected and studies ancient arts to make her something of a superwoman. She plays a contract killer that gets close to a family that end up becoming her next hit. When her compassion renders her unable to destroy them, she decides instead to protect them against evil forces.Like many supernatural actions flicks, this one starts with an ancient legend. It is one that prophecies the coming of a great warrior to bring peace to the earth and eradicate all evil forces. The film leads you into believing Elektra is that warrior. But her character, while strong, is far from superhuman. Towards the end of the film, things almost get a bit ridiculous when we see similar invincible performances taken from ""Alias"". Garner remains all dolled up and ready for combat only to have easily been defeated a thousand times already.

I guess it's the first attempt Kevin Feige and friends at Marvel to build various characters together. It failed miserably, but I'm glad that they came back for more.Elektra is not perfect, the dialogue is corny, the plot is rather slender and tries a little too hard to disguise that with childhood flashbacks and soul-searching complete with a rather pointless sub- plot and while impressively choreographed the final confrontation was somewhat anti-climatic. However, it is a visually stylish movie with great cinematography, fantastic locations cool costumes and fun special effects. I was impressed also with the choreography of the action sequences complete with some very clever stunt work, the surreal atmosphere Elektra created and the brooding soundtrack. There is effort to make the characters interesting, and the acting is decent enough. Jennifer Garner is attractive and does bring weight and charisma to the role, Goran Visjinc is surprisingly natural and Terrence Stamp is good and very commanding. The villains are subtle and have vitality, especially Stone, if underused. I didn't care for Kirsten Prout, too bland and annoying for my tastes. Overall, decent if nothing exceptional.",Elektra

At least Ben Affleck stayed away from this one...Garner was alright, but still unconvincing as Elektra to anyone who's read the comics. In fact, all of the characters in the film were fairly stock compared to the characters in the comics - and I'm not sure how Stone, Typhoid Mary and Tattoo came to work with Kirigi for the Hand, but hey, it's not the first time they've skewed comic book history for the sake of a Marvel movie. Only in the X-Men films, the results worked.The first two-thirds of this film were actually quite watchable. Then it degenerated into a Hollywood action/romance. Dozens of Hand Ninjas swarming a mansion only to be dispatched in one fail swoop. Then, a battle between Elektra and Kirigi that is a frail, second-rate knockoff of a Hong Kong martial arts film - right down to the room full of swirling linens lifted straight out of Hero. Finally, a horribly saccharine Hollywood ending, complete with hideously cheesy dialogue and the tragic love-storybook ending. If you've seen on, you've seen 'em all.Until that point, we had good action, solid performances by Goran Visnjic and Terence Stamp, cool villains, and a buildup to what could have been a great penultimate showdown only to disintegrate into a penultimate letdown.My suggestion: give it a shot on DVD.

While on a routine mission she befriends a young girl and her father, who she discovers are her next targets. She decides quite quickly that she won't kill them and must now protect them. Hearing of her betrayal they send a superhuman group of assassins primed with different cg powers. Tattoo being the most impressive as his body art comes to life, the evil girl, the bosses son, the other guy and the strong one are severely underused.

Garner makes a fine leading lady and can definitely carry a film on her own. But there is just too much fodder here for it to be considered more than a slightly above mediocre guilty pleasure. She's sexy as hell and sports a killer bod but the unbelievable quick chemistry with the young girls father is quite laughable and the cg and cinematograpghy although quite impressive steals repeatedly from much better martial arts fare such as House of flying daggers. Like I said Garner is the best reason to go see this film, and since shes the title character thats a plus but she's not enough to comply a whole hearted recommendation although entertaining and worlds above it's horrid predecessor it lacks any memorable qualities. The only thing I walked away remembering was how much I wanted it to be an alias episode. 6/10",Elektra
86,dcobbimdb,Better than i heard / thought it would be...,8,11 April 2005,"It may be all the bad hype prior to me seeing this movie, but I thought it was pretty good. And it certainly kept my interest throughout. I wasn't very impressed with Daredevil at all as I'm not a fan of Affleck, and Jennifer actually kind of bugged me in that movie too. Colin Farrell was the only one in that movie I actually liked So really I only rented Elektra cause I have the blockbuster pass and figured, what the hell... Much to my surprise I thought it was pretty good. Looking back I'm not sure why so many people bagged on this movie. Maybe all the chauvinistic guys out there didn't like a main character being a woman, dunno Personally I thought the pace and flow of the movie was good and as I said above it kept my interest throughout. The music was pretty good as well and fitting for most of the movie.I thought Jennifer did a pretty good job in this movie. The main bad guys were pretty cool although a couple of them died pretty quickly as noted by other reviews, however there were enough bad guys such that it didn't really matter IMO. The effects were okay and done in a surreal dreamlike way that I thought was befitting for the movie. I'm sure others who saw it just thought it looked lame or cheap, but I thought it was good. Also did anyone notice that Stick / Terence Stamp (sensei) was none other than General Zod from superman II. According to IMDb he's been in quite a bit since then, though this is the first time I've seen him since then. I actually recognized him by voice rather than looks as the guy is getting up there in years.I thought the fight scenes were good and the only real rip off was the sheets (very similar to Hero) but other than that the fight sequences were pretty good overall. I'm not saying I'm going to run out and buy it, but it's better than quite a few of the marvel comic movies to come out lately. They give good closure to the movie in the end, but definitely leave it open for a sequel, though after the bad publicity it's received I doubt they'll be making another one any time soon.If you're afraid to watch it based off all the negative feedback, rent it and you might be surprised like I was.",Elektra

We can't always be discriminating and intellectual in our attempts to probe the artistic complexities engaged in the artform of film.Sometimes, a film is just . . . fun, or quirky, or in some other way entertaining - and this is where Elektra comes in, complete with her trademark red assassin warrior outfit.It is fun to watch Jennifer Gardner work her craft as she threads her way through the dialogue and scenes in this film.All things considered, she is a good casting match for the Elektra character.As for the story itself . . . well, we're not talking war and peace here.Aside from the major plot theme, the film does take the viewer into some dark personal views into Elektra herself . . . who she really is (and is not), and various situations that led her into th e profession she has become so skilled But, if you happen to be an Elektra fan (from the comic / graphic novel realm), you'll appreciate the extent to which this character has been translated to film . . . not always an easy or successful process.Not a block buster, or leading edge provocative film . . . no, but for just plain fun, and also a movie that kids can see without too much concern, I'll give this a thumbs up.",Elektra

Unfortunately, ""Elektra"" is far from being such an example and that is mainly due to it's unlikable and one dimensional protagonist who is made even worst by Jenifer Garner's bland, unconvincing and downright soulless performance.",Elektra
90,Ky-D,"Bad, simple as that.",2,9 April 2005,"I rate studio films on a different scale than indie flicks. Studio films have finance, trained talent, equipment, etc. Indie flicks have varying degrees of ingenuity. So when a film has everything going for and comes up short, it just looks that much worse.Guess what? Elektra survived her impalement at the hands of Bullseye (how? who cares). Rather than hooking back up with the love of her life Mr. Matt Murdock, she instead has joined up with some ninjas and works as an assassin. While preparing to complete a mission, she finds she can't kill the targets (why? she had dinner with them one time, some tough assassin) and decides to protect them instead. And the plot is off and running.Everything about the movie is just plain bad or boring or dull or all three. Before the story gets moving, the audience is subjected to lots and lots of nothing except lengthy shots of Elektra sitting around being depressed and introvert.Once she starts whooping up on some bad guys it doesn't get much better. The fights are exaggerated and touched up with some un-special FX. The bad guys erupt in clouds of green smoke when they die...GREEN SMOKE?!? Who the hell thought that would be cool? The choreography lacks the ethereal 'umph', they are little more than elaborate dance sequences. Not to mention than any and every action scene is so over done and heavy handed that not an ounce of real energy is ever produced. Example: Elektra goes swinging around on tree branches and then runs down the tree as it fall to the grounds, lands on her feet and not only doesn't hurt herself, she doesn't even break a sweat. I'm all for suspension of disbelief, but this is just stupid.Of all the action flicks that have come out and will be available in short order, I can find no reason to recommend this to any one. Not even those anxious to ogle Jennifer Gardner 2/10",Elektra
91,flickershows,The Luscious Lady In Red,6,20 January 2005,"Well, it's not the worst superhero movie I've ever seen. 'Elektra' first, last, and most importantly, has Jennifer Garner. Not only is she an angular beauty, the star of TV's ""Alias"" is a terrific athlete (although I guess her stunt woman is even better) and she's not lacking for charisma either. And, luckily, a good friend with the power of God brought her back to life after that jerk Colin Farrell killed her in 'Daredevil'. Comic book fans might have been begging for a spin-off of her 'Daredevil' character, but was anyone else? I saw the movie because of who was playing Elektra and that's it. She may not be the next Hepburn (either one), but she sure is pretty.It's too bad this flick is so bland and marginal because there are 2 or 3 cool villains, all members of The Hand (apparently, this is the Mob in Marvel comic land). The head of the black hats (Will Yun Lee) is nothing special, but his henchman include scary folks named Tattoo, Stone, and Typhoid. They seem to be an unstoppable combination, until they meet a lone (and lonely) woman who can stop them. Elektra doesn't have quite the same magical powers as her rivals, although she's able to disappear and reappear like Tony Hopkins in 'Dracula'. Come to think of it, the ground rules for her actual abilities are never made clear by director Rob Bowman. Oh well, she's good enough to be able beat up everybody.So the Lady in Red is paid to assassinate a man (Goran Visnjic, who actually smiles for the first time in his career) and his teenage daughter, Abby (Kirsten Prout). Abby is quite a fightin' prodigy herself. The hired killer can't go through with it, then actually helps her new friends flee from The Hand. Terence Stamp works some Miyagi magic for Elektra as a blind mentor with mad skills. Stamp has panache, but nobody can class up this drab script. The whole plot is nothing we haven't seen before. Ah, but it would be wrong not to mention Garner's red outfit. I don't want to own the 'Elektra' DVD, but I might buy a gigantic poster of Garner in that sexy battle gear.",Elektra
92,Boggman,Not very Elektrafying,4,10 June 2005,"O.K....so the movie starts off pretty good, but about 30-40 minutes into it, Elektra takes a wrong turn and becomes some sort of teenage girl super hero fantasy.Elektra (Jennifer Garner) was killed in the movie ""Daredevil"", but apparently was brought back to life by some kind of Zen master using a mystical force called ""Kimagure"", which allows her to see in the future for a limited amount of time. She works as an assassin, going from one mission to another.She is sent to a lake house to kill father/daughter Mark (Goran Visnjic) and Abby (Kirsten Prout) Miller. Not knowing they are her victims at first, the young Abby begins to bond with Elektra. After a Christmas dinner against her will with both father and daughter, Elektra begins to come out of her shell. She learns that Mark is a widower, and that his wife was previously killed by a drunk driver. Of course she relates to Abby, after losing her mother at an early age also.Afterwards, Elektra finds out that Mark and Abby are her next assignment, and that a group of highly skilled and mystical vigilantes called ""The Order of the Hand"" are the ones who put the hit on the Millers. Elektra tries to kill the Millers, but alas, she just can't seem to do it.So she does the next best thing: she joins forces with them and decides to fight against the ""Hand"", whose members all have special abilities of there own (which for the most part are pretty cool) Along the way ""Elektra"" realizes that the Millers' aren't exactly who they claim to be. This reviewer won't disclose who the Millers' are but will say that once they are revealed, that is when the movie ""Elektra"" really becomes some sort of Spy Kids/Wonder Woman/Wonder Girl kind of soap opera.All in all Elektra isn't a horrible movie; it's just not a great one either. It suffers from some pretty long stretches throughout. It also fluctuates on being a film made for adults and then for kids; but never really finds it's footing with either audience. Essentially, the film ends up feeling as though it was made for teenage girls.Having never read the Elektra comic book character, I am not sure how closely the comic interpretation of Elektra matches the film. The one thing I am positive of is that Jennifer Garner looks better than ever in the red costume she wears, and she can definitely hold a film together; especially when there's not much of anything else to grab on to.",Elektra
93,twpain,Just Not Good,4,29 June 2020,Elektra is a very weak film in my opinion. The writing is lazy and the plot isn't even interesting. The weird romance sub plot does not work making for a very strange Jennifer Garner film that is utterly forgettable.,Elektra
94,walken_on_sunshine,Elektra:The Docs Review,5,30 April 2006,"I never have even read the Marvel Comic ELEKTRA is based on, so I will judge the movie pretending it was not an adaptation.Like all killers with super-powers,elektra doesn't bother boring us with her hopes and dreams for a better tomorrow. She makes a pretty good living killing people and minding her own business.Since Elektra doesn't ask her handler for any details on the reason for the hits, I assume she doesn't care whether her targets deserve to die.I liked the overall dark, dank tone that Elektra has it makes for good entertainment.Being empowered with super-human strength and invulnerability as well as the ability to see almost into the near future does, however, make one morose, suspicious, and prone to living in the past. Elektra is about the dark nature of the superhero, Both ""X-Men"" flicks, the two ""Spider-Man"" films and the ""Daredevil"" movie that spawned this quasi-sequel were all about the downside of having to save the world on a regular basis.overall an enjoyable action flick.",Elektra
95,Matti-Man,Mix 'n' match comic book mythology,6,19 March 2006,"How does Hollywood do it? How do they manage to take really great comic book story lines and dilute them to the point where they're wishy-washy shadows of the source material?Frank Miller's run on Marvel's DAREDEVIL comic was once of the best pieces of sustained invention in the comics canon. Hardly a foot was put wrong as Miller reinvented the nature of Daredevil's powers and cleverly revised the character's history, giving him a hitherto unknown college sweetheart (if that's the right term) - the wildchild daddy's-girl ELEKTRA.In this movie version, the film-makers thought it a good idea to take Daredevil's mentor, the blind man ""Stick"", and make him Elektra's mentor, even though this makes no sense at all. In the comics, Stick teaches the blind Daredevil to develop his other abilities to compensate for his loss of sight, even as Stick himself did. But Elektra has no such handicap, so transferring Stick to the role of Elektra's mentor is a dramatic redundancy.Then to compound things, the implication (it's not stated outright) is that Stick brought Elektra back to life. That too is at odds with Stick's character. Why would a good guy interfere with the Laws of Nature? In the comics, it's The Hand that brings Elektra back to life for their own selfish reasons.And my final niggle is how Elektra uses sai as stabbing, offensive weapons. Japanes sai are, in reality, defensive, clubbing weapons, originally used by civilian peacekeeping officers (like today's police) to defend against samurai swords. The curly handguards of sai are designed to trap and break sword blades. Often sai had just one curly handguard rather than two. The long ""blade"" section would have been a steel rod with no edge and a blunt point which was used in a clubbing action against rowdy or drunk sword-wielding nuisances.Granted, this last one is not the fault of the film-makers, as Frank Miller's DAREDEVIL comic also showed sai being used for stabbing. But the opportunity to correct the error was missed with the movie version of ELEKTRA. To see sai used correctly, seek out a copy of ZHONG HUA ZHANG FU (aka HEROES OF THE EAST) and watch master martial artist Chia Hui Liu (aka Gordon Liu, of KILL BILL fame) and his butterfly knives go up against a Japanese sai fighter (Yasutaka Nakazaki).But in all fairness, these are minor niggles. Overall, ELEKTRA is pretty entertaining - at least as good as DAREDEVIL, if not a little better. It's just that, given the excellence of the source material, it should have been a whole lot better. But then, Hollywood has always been pretty useless at doing martial arts films ...",Elektra
96,westpenn49,a pleasant afternoon diversion,6,16 April 2006,"Memoirs of a Geisha was not the first movie to use the wrong Asians, but this one is even crazier as it uses non Asians (Terrence Stamp) to play roles that seem awfully Asian and of course the lead Japanese villain is played by a Korean American! Oh well, the movie is pretty and pleasant. Ms. Garner a delight and Goric Visnjic nice eye candy.Who cares that Elektra herself seems for much of the movie to be more of a Treasure than the Treasure or more powerful than Typhoid a character who claims at one point ""You know, I used to be the Treasure and I don't like being replaced."" Garner's Elektra is more than either so why isn't she the one to upset the balance of good and evil? Is it because she is morally ambiguous? If so her bi-morality is refreshing in contrast to the dark and lights that surround her world.",Elektra
97,misbegotten,They should have made 'Daredevil 2' instead.,3,26 October 2005,"Elektra was originally intended to be a stop-gap between Daredevil (2003) and a planned Daredevil 2. However, although Daredevil didn't disgrace itself at the box office, both Marvel Entertainment and 20th Century Fox seemed to have been embarrassed by the fact that it wasn't a huge X-Men or Spider Man-sized hit, and the announced Daredevil sequel has apparently quietly vanished from Fox and Marvel's production schedule.As a result, Elektra reached the big screen with all Daredevil references (including a confirmed cameo by Ben Affleck and a rumoured appearance by Colin Farrell) left on the cutting room floor, and was instead transformed into a vehicle for Alias actress Jennifer Garner.The most interesting thing about the film are it's heavily stylised fight scenes, which don't rely solely on the wirework that swamped American action movies after The Matrix (1999). Instead, just as U.S. horror films are currently either remaking or borrowing stylistic tricks from Asian cinema, so Elektra is the first Stateside movie to attempt to appeal to the House of Flying Daggers and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon audience.However, this potentially intriguing approach is immediately undone by the inclusion of a group of colourful assassins with supernatural powers, who are only in the movie so some eye-catching CGI effects can appear in the trailer, in an attempt to bring in the teenage/popcorn X-Men crowd.In addition, great action scenes count for nothing if they are in the middle of a vacuum. After a promising start (with a great uncredited cameo by Jason Issacs) the film stalls and never recovers. The storyline is one of the most uneventful and simplistic that I've seen in a major studio release. A fine cast has been assembled, but apart from Garner, they have practically nothing to do, and Elektra's journey from 'hired killer with shut-down emotions' to 'principled warrior fighting for good' is portrayed in a straight-forward and utterly predictable fashion. Even the moment when she succumbs to a poisonous kiss from arch-assassin Typhoid (Natassia Malthe) is entirely without drama, as the audience knows that the film is only halfway through, and therefore Elektra clearly isn't going to die.Garner turns in a solid performance, but is saddled with too many lengthy scenes of Elektra performing yoga or staring out across a lake. The rest of the cast do what they can with the little the script gives them, but apart from the aforementioned Issacs, only Colin Cunningham makes an impression as Elektra's agent, and his final exchange of dialogue with Garner is the most touching moment in the film. Goran Visnjic and Terence Stamp (as Stick) basically just take the money, while Will Yun Lee actually earns his by making swordsman Kirigi an effective - if somewhat bland - final opponent. Nastassia Malthe is gorgeous and has undeniable screen presence, but her screen-time is so limited that we don't find out if she can actually act. Hopefully her appearance here will lead to better things and that question will be answered.Ultimately, this film is a good-looking but empty time-waster, that will disappoint fans of the much superior Daredevil movie.",Elektra
98,irish23,Not so much,2,9 September 2008,"Not so much action. Not so much plot. Not so much character development. In short, not so much a movie at all!I went in with low expectations and was originally impressed with the costumes, sets, and intriguing flashbacks. That quickly faded into boredom and incredulity. By the time all the bad guys showed up, I was gone. (And I know they can't change the names of the super-villains, but these were just plain silly.)Jennifer Garner is underwhelming as Elektra, with a ridiculous sashay and unimpressive action work. Compare with Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider and you can see how, even in fluff flicks, action can sing with the right actor. Kirsten Prout (Abby) was the best part of the picture for me, as she seemed to actually believe in what she was doing. It probably helped that her lines were straightforward, believable, teen-appropriate language. Everyone else seemed to have taken night courses in Cryptic to get by.The ""plot"" is flimsy, the fight choreography is unimaginative, the acting is sub-par, and the camera work isn't flattering to the actors or their surroundings.

It's more like a cosplay drama.Elektra was created by Frank Miller! Sin City, The Dark Knight, Batman Year One - which became Batman Begins with Christian Bale.

100,Denver53,"Not as bad as feared, but incomplete",5,31 January 2006,"When Elektra was in theaters, the reviews I read trashed it. Daredevil wasn't very good, and most critics said this spin-off was worse. But when I finally caught up with Electra on HBO, it was better than I expected. It was just incomplete.The story arc is almost elegant, in a way. (Spoilers) Elektra is a bitter woman whose anger from a childhood tragedy caused her martial arts teacher to boot her out of his school, so she can learn lessons by living them (vs. being taught). She apparently was too angry and therefore could not progress until she dealt with that.Of course, being kicked out by the person she respects for reasons that to her are unclear just makes her more angry. So, Elektra becomes an assassin. We meet her sometime after she has been successful at her new craft. There is moral ambiguity here, because we don't learn what kinds of people she has killed. If she kills ""bad people,"" then she can retain her innocence. It is hard to root for anyone who kills good people for hire. But what she has done in the past isn't clear. It is incomplete. And as we learn, someone on the side of good is involved with giving her her assignments (through her agent, of all things) ... so I suppose we should assume Elektra only assassinated bad people. That should have been better defined.We do see her next contract - a father and his teenage daughter, who (not coincidentally) live in a lake cabin near where Elektra has been told to rent a house for a bit. Turns out the daughter is special, and thus ensues the main point of the film - Elektra learns she doesn't have to remain bitter, and does good deeds along the way.I mention all this because it is classic redemption of a hero, but the holes left by the script don't close the loop. Neither does the ending, in which henchmen are eliminated but not the bosses in charge. No one seems concerned about that. With a tighter script, this movie could have been a 7. I gave it a 5.",Elektra

The plot, frankly isn't much, but Garner is dead sexy in this. She clearly bulked up and threw herself, quite literally in some scenes, into this movie. Elektra is an assassin but she can't quite bring herself to kill a single dad, dully played by ER's Goran Visjnic, and his daughter. Good thing as this turns out to be her ultimate test! Terence Stamp is very good here and the movie moves at a brisk pace.Garner really looks and acts the part right down to the sexy costume, the flashbacks are useful and innovative. I was disappointed that Typhoid Mary has basically a bit part, but the actress in the role is good. The action sequences are sharp and fast and at least Ben Affleck disown't pop up to negate the seriousness of the picture! All in all this was better than I expected.

She is a murderer and a victim. That's how she is in Bill Sienkiewicz and Frank Miller's Elektra. That's how she is in David Mazzuchielli and Frank Miller's Daredevil. But that's not how she is here : over-sensitive, crying for this or that, doubting, talking, talking, talking... She survives the story only because she gets helped... Surprises ? Fun ? Images ? Clever plot ? Hmmm... You'll find nothing of that in this B-Grade blockbuster, nothing but a quite boring Jennifer Gardner (strong shoulders, yeah, so what ?), irrational characters and situations : the willing suspension of disbelief never worked for me here. The Daredevil movie was really not the best of all the Marvel franchises (but fairly done), Elektra was made by people who don't care much : I guess the director didn't take time to read the book, I guess that Jennifer Gardner plays in the movie because of an old contract she wished she could break... Well, really, a waste of time.",Elektra
103,tripwires,Expectedly B-grade,6,25 January 2005,"The only reason I even bothered with this, even though I knew that I wouldn't like it, is Jennifer Garner, whom I think is totally, totally, totally hot. Too bad for her: she deserved a much better script.Elektra has its share of gripping moments, but on the whole, it was awfully silly. First of all - and this really irks me - they shamefully got a Korean actor to play a Japanese. How many times must Hollywood commit this kind of stupidity before they realise that the different Asian race aren't substitutes for each other? (Admittedly, the Korean actor is hot, but that is not the point.) Secondly, Elektra boasted some of the worst special effects I've ever seen; they looked like something out of a computer game or a low-budget, locally-produced gongfu television series. The constant usage of slow motion went heavily into overkill territory, such that some of such moments became so cheesy that they completely lost their credibility and the semblance to depth and meaning the film-makers were obviously aiming for (an example would be the fight scene between Elektra and the pseudo-Japanese dude with the sword).Thirdly, the plot, or what was supposed to be the plot. I'll just say this plainly: What the hell was that? The ending left much to be desired; not only was it extremely anti-climatic and ""that's it?""-inducing, it was also blatantly obvious that the people behind it were already gearing themselves up for a sequel. Questions which you'd expect the movie to answer upon its conclusion were hardly dealt with, hence cheating the audience out of a holistic cinematic experience. Save for Elektra, there was also a grave lack of character development. The only reason I cared about Mark whateverhisnameis was because it's Goran Visnjic, who is deliciously gorgeous; other than that, I couldn't care any less about the other characters.The plus points: Elektra was halfway understood and Jennifer Garner portrayed her nuances with tremendous efficacy. And then there's Goran Visnjic, who is - have I mentioned this? - deliciously gorgeous; hence, it's too bad that he had such little screen time. I believe I would have enjoyed the movie a lot more if there was more of him. In addition, Elektra was marginally better than Daredevil, which was the most boring and pointless action movie I've seen in quite a while. And one last plus point: Elektra did not have the insufferable Ben Affleck. That's a cause for cheer and celebration, whatever the occasion.See this only if you like Jennifer Garner and Goran Visnjic.",Elektra

There were a lot of elements here that could make for a good movie, but unfortunately nothing ever develops.You have the mysterious secret Japanese Ninja society. Check. (They're the enemy, right?) You got the tortured super-heroine who exists in robotic monotone. Check. You have the estranged blind sensei. Check. (He hustles pool on the side) You got the cute rebellious kid who is More than She Seems. Check. Super-weapons. Check. The ""I always knew your heart was pure"" line. Check. Endless shots of Garner in skin-tight costumes from every angle. Oops missed that one. Oh well.The problem is there is no cohesive back-story to tie all this together. By the time the big battle scene comes, it's hard to understand why anyone would care.

Garner was the only decent item in the movie.She gave a good performance. Too bad the rest of the movie didn't hold up.For once I would like to see a comic book-to-movie movie that doesn't require the viewer to know all the backstory of the main character before seeing the first frame. We get bits and pieces that are just scenes shown in flashback with no connection with what is going on.The story had promise and touches of greatness but the plot holes were just too much to ignore. Electra is an assassin but we don't see how hard she is. It would have been nice to see her complete a few ""jobs"" before the meat of the film starts.There were some interesting fight scenes - like with the sheets - but a lot of the moves and sequences we have seen before. Also as powerful as the bad guys, ""The Hand"", seem their ends came too easily after a lot of fighting - it seemed all for naught. Some the camera work was so hurky jerky it was impossible to know what was going on.There were too many scenes of people staring off in the distance, either brooding or reflecting. To me it was dead space.Just a personal note. One thing expected in these big budget SFX movies are great one liners you can repeat to all your friends at the water cooler the next day.

109,jpkwolf,A disappointing spin off,4,1 July 2005,"They could have made so much better movie from the comic but of course Daredevil had already made the character less adult, one dimensional and ""more appealing"" to an average teenager. I was expecting only action but the plot and direction are so disappointing they have to be noticed. Daredevil didn't have much plot to speak of but at least there was something. Elektra's plot leaves many things unexplained which is annoying. The producers probably thought that teenagers wouldn't care.There's also this bad guy whose animal tattoos come to life. I'm sorry but he is just boring and the CGI in his abilities was not very good. They should have just left him out of the movie. Most of the bad guys didn't get much screen time. They didn't get to fight much and died easily. There was no blood in the movie because the latest trend in Hollywood is to cut all the blood out from movies so that all kids can see them.With a little effort the movie could have at least been a decent action movie if not a good movie about Elektra. Now it's just a mess.. There are few things that are good though. The action is not all bad and Jennifer Garnier kicked ass and acted quite well. Even though the movies story and plot were flat and non-existent as hell. All in all the movie went by fast and was slightly enjoyable but very disappointing.",Elektra
110,segratz,Very Disappointing Female Superhero Movie,2,19 January 2005,"What a disappointment this movie is - this is the kind of film where I really want my money back. Elektra is a great female Marvel Universe character full of conflict, emotion, action, and sex appeal. This movie basically has a female assassin named Elektra, and that is about it when it comes to relating her to the awesome comic character. I really like Jennifer Garner too, so I'm sad they made her out to be so flat, with bad lines and crappy make-up. Even the villains are incredibly lame! The worst parts of the movie are where they try to duplicate the CGI enhanced action sequences that were in HERO (here it's SHEETS and CURTAINS flying around, not leaves, and all I thought was get that crap out of my fight scene!) and they most certainly do not work here. If you like comics, you probably won't like this movie. I can see why it's going to bomb! I hope ONE DAY they make a great female superhero movie.",Elektra

It wouldn't have been as bad had she not done that little pose, because that's what sent it over the top. The instant that moment manifested itself on screen, I instantaneously lost an additional 10 IQ points as my brain processed what my eyes were seeing.

112,loogenhausen,Sai-ah-snore-ah...,3,9 November 2011,"Elektra is without a doubt one of the most disappointing comic book movies ever to be released. Daredevil is a classic compared to the Rob Bowman/Fox directorial failure here. First of all, the entire movie's tone betrays the source material of the comics. Even Daredevil tried to be gritty and somewhat succeeded. Here, it's just a bunch of bad special effects, poor editing and even poorer martial arts choreography mixed together in a short, choppy and ultimately lifeless muddle of a movie. The 'real' Elektra stories in the comics were violent, dark and exciting. This should have been an all the way R-rated movie with plenty of violence and adult themes. The people who grew up on Elektra are old enough to care and actually pay to see an R movie. The box office success of such movies as Terminator 2, The Matrix Reloaded, 300 and others prove that if there is enough demand for a movie, people will see it no matter what it is rated. Throughout the entire movie, there is no sense of urgency whatsoever. One character gets killed off midway through the movie and no one cares because there is no emotion or logic behind it. The villains are beyond cardboard cutouts and completely uninteresting. Seeing Jennifer Garner in red leather is not enough to make up for ninety minutes of listless boredom. Garner, Terence Stamp and Goran Visnjic are all fine actors, but are wasted here in a meandering, uninteresting and extremely disappointing adaptation of one of the more popular figures in Marvel Comics. Like Wolverine and The Punisher, Elektra has a rabid following that would have surely made this movie a large success had it been made the way it deserved to be filmed. It's just sad to see potentially great comic book movies fall by the wayside due to lack of patience and/or disinterest for the actual source material. It just makes the intended audience feel insulted and cheated. Elektra ranks right up there with Barb Wire and Steel as one of worst comic book adaptations so far.",Elektra
113,beastwarsfan,I hate this movie,1,10 August 2006,"One of the most awful comic book based movies ever! At the moment I can't recall anything worse except ""Captain America"" (1991). I could forgive them the bad action sequences, uninteresting fights and sloppy CGI effects if there was a script. But there isn't. All the actors act without any inspiration or effort, just walk in front of the camera and say their lines. I can't believe it that I actually managed to watch the whole (so called) movie. I guess I was hoping that at the end it will get better. But it didn't. Actually it got even worse. Waste of time, waste of money, waste of film. And waste of Elektra. If you are a comic book fan and especially Elektra fan you can try it out, driven by curiosity. Otherwise just do not approach this title.",Elektra
114,Gezzerboy,Not a total waste of time,5,1 March 2005,Yes Jennifer Garnier is gorgeous and after watching her in 13 going on 30 i thought I might as well give this a try. I am a Marvel fan but have found the last 2 offerings from them not to be that hot and this one certainly follows suit. Unless you actually read the comics I found the storyline a bit difficult to understand as they failed to go into any depths as to why she was who she was and what the HAND actually are. Anyway all in all there were some cool fight scenes (not enough) and she plays the part pretty well. I would like to see her do some more adult stuff like (Long kiss goodnight) sort of films but if you have nothing else to watch its worth the entrance fee but apart from that don't expect the earth to move,Elektra

117,Marthian80,"Interesting character, awful movie",3,25 October 2016,"Elektra is about a woman (played by Jennifer Garner) who is a skilled assassin trained to look a short distance into the future to anticipate on what is going to happen next. She is haunted by the past and only lives for her job to kill the next target, having cut all bonds with family and friends. Her life changes drastically when she meets a single dad with a teenage daughter who are attacked by supernatural assassins.The story of the character Elektra is interesting but unfortunately this movie doesn't do anything with it. It doesn't explain anything about who Elektra is or what's troubling her from the past, she is just there to kill and show Garner's body in various poses. There is no chemistry between the other characters and they have the same depth as wooden planks. They try to create a bond between Abby Miller and Elektra but because it is forced upon us from nowhere and we have no idea who this Abby is, it just falls flat. The same goes for the romance subplot with Mark Miller (the single dad).There is some descent action here but the fight scenes seems to be lifted straight out of a computer game. The only thing missing is a voice over announcing; ""Round 1, Fight!"" ""Elektra wins!"". There is also very little background info provided about who the villains are and why the Miller family is hunted. They are just wooden planks to be picked off for Elektra. The final fights are also so laughable bad, you cannot take this movie seriously anymore at this point.",Elektra
118,go2dean,Great Work,8,12 May 2005,"Jennifer Garner continues to amaze with her great presence and intensity. I've been very impressed with her work for the past 5 years now. Rob Bowman also did a much better job with this piece then his effort in the X-Files film. I also have to give props to Kristen Prout (Abby), and Natassie Malthe (Typhoid). **SPOILER-ALERT** Prout did a great job in transforming her character from a sassy teen to a butt-kicking phenom. Malthe gave her character exactly what it called for ""seductive but deadly"". The overall development of the Elektra character took me by surprise. I originally was not interested in seeing this film in the theaters since it appeared to be a retread from Daredevil. Well, Daredevil be damned. This movie can stand on it's own and could very well become a franchise. The story line is very engaging and one that can be built on. In a super-hero action film, there is nothing like a band of super-villains to keep hero's hands full. The fight scene were very well choreographed, and the technique was crisp as well. If there was any doubt about Garner being a belt, this movie removes that. She's the real thing for those of us who appreciate good martial arts. A good on-screen slow down would be Garner vs. Rothrock. This movie is a must see, especially for those who were disappointed with the Daredevil film. Elektra has everything that DD did not have, and was everything it was meant to be. A film and a character that stands on it's own.",Elektra
119,TonysLittleFriend,"Elektra-fying? I think not. But not a disappointment either. A decent comic book flick, that needed to be made.",5,16 January 2005,"Having cheated death as a target of Bullseye in Daredevil, Elektra survives with, I can guess, emotional scars. But in her nightmares the persistent image that haunts her is that the death of her mother in an idyllic white bedroom, and the fleeting glimpse of her slayer. This, it appears, is one of the things that keeps her going, one of the things that likely propelled her to become an assassin for hire; an assassin so good that among those who have witnessed her at work her image has ascended to a somewhat mythical status. It's nice to be so highly thought of.The movie begins with what I believe is its most impressive moment, and one of the most brilliant sequences in recent comic book films, a fine introduction at that. A crime boss sits alone having a drink, waiting, instinctively knowing he's Elektra's target. Resigned to the inevitable, he tells one of his henchmen exactly how she goes about her business and why he's still alive after a prior encounter. In his case, for optimum effect, the thought of death is even worse when you know, without question, it's coming.He now realizes this was her intent. And like the stories he has heard, he expects she'll whisper in his ear before she kills him. The scene does Elektra's myth good. I'd like to say the same for the rest of the movie, but beyond this point it's more like a depletion of the myth, at least from the audience's standpoint.Elektra's right-hand man informs her that her next assignment is a cash windfall and certainly worth the take, so they gear up and go for it. She commences the first part of the assignment: relocating for a couple months to a sparsely populated island. The house itself is an impressive piece of architecture. And there she prepares, waits for further directions. To no one's surprise there's a workout montage, during which I'll note that she does one-handed pull-ups. I'm not sure if Rocky ever did that. That scene was particularly hot. Lol. A young girl, Abby breaks into Elektra's house and is about to endure her wrath. Then again, she didn't know an assassin was taking up residence there, so she did find it surprising to have her shirt sleeve nailed to the wall by a box opener. Abby, it turns out, lives nearby with her father, Mark, and she wouldn't mind at all if Elektra and he got to know each other a little better. And wouldn't you know it, it's after they get to know each other a little that Elektra's second directive arrives, her target is Abby and Mark. And, she's not down with that.Not down with it at all. Killing them would have been easy, but keeping an eye on them becomes even tougher. Abby, you see, has a talent for fighting that's already almost on par with Elektra, and the renegade group known as the Hand wants her for their own. Elektra, of course, won't have that either. So what transpires is an effort by Elektra to protect Abby from abduction.The bad guy, Kirigi's group of killers are introduced. Tattoo, Stone and Typhoid They're an intriguing lot. Unfortunately we don't really get to know anything about them. It's a parade of undeveloped characters. Thus their interactions with Elektra are essentially hollow, entertaining if only through the demonstration of their powers. The fight scenes are neatly shot, and edited so quickly, and that of course is cool. But there must be something more than that. Even the final fight scene was uneventful enough to make me glance at my watch.The film lacks any real action that it could have, and should have been loaded to the gills with. I'm on par with this film along with Daredevil. Daredevil had problems with character development, which Elektra certainly has no problem with, but Elektra has problems with the action. There just isn't enough to keep anyone satisfied. That's to say it's a bad movie, it's not. But it's not a great movie either. It's just goodIt's pretty average and not worth recommending if you want action. To me, it is better than Daredevil. Gardner is perfect as Elektra. She's got the beauty, the acting, the skills, and oh yea, the beauty. Did I mention she's beautiful? It's worth a look if you want 90 minutes of wasting time, but you can something better to do with your 8 bucks. I for one enjoyed it. Sexy is as sexy does....***/*****",Elektra

Writers did a OK job, but without the actors, the movie would have fallen flat. Lots of action. Tons of remorse. A decent movie to add to your selection if your into action and gorgeous ladies.

121,xgray-03873,This was really not a good spin-off movie!,3,4 May 2017,"Yeah, I don't think that ""Elektra (2005)"" was a very good spin-off movie to begin with. I mean, not once did I actually believe that Jennifer Garner was in fact Elektra Natchios in this movie or in the 2003 Daredevil movie at all. She's just some airhead in a skimpy corset to me. And honestly, her outfit in this movie is ridiculous. Like, this is what they considered to be a cool outfit for a female ninja assassin?! Lame!!!! Never really liked the character of Abby because she was a pain in the neck and I really don't buy Tarrace Stamp's performance as ""Stick"" in this movie. Lastly, the villains are boring. At least with the 2003 Daredevil movie, it had the Kingpin and Bull's-Eye. But this?! We got the actor who played Shang Tsung from Mortal Kombat as the leader of ""The Hand"" and some other generic mystical henchmen led by his son, played by Will Yun-Lee and that's it. That's what we got for villains in this movie.So, if you're like expecting to see some cool action scenes featuring the character of Elektra Natchios, you're not gonna get with this movie. I would strongly recommend watching the Netflix Daredevil series, instead.Overall, don't even bother with this movie. It's boring, tedious and well, kind of pointless. It's no wonder why Fox gave the rights to Daredevil back to Marvel. Now if only they would do the same thing to the Fantastic Four, but that's gonna take even longer.",Elektra
122,VichusSmith,Better than DD and Punisher,6,12 August 2005,"No one bit when this movie came out in theatres because Daredevil was bad enough; who would want to see the spawn of a badly made movie? But Electra is another creature on its own. It gives nods to the events in Daredevil, most notably Elektra's death, and it uses the villains called The Hand which do appear in marvel comics.The problems with this movie are apparent in the first minutes of the movie. Uh, wasn't this the ""ultimate battle of good and evil?"" What you'll get in this movie is a battle between Elektra and the Hand. That's it. There are no cataclysmic events and no mega powerful beings tearing up the scenery. I am really disgusted with every movie that comes out and uses the ""ultimate battle between good an evil"" as a tag line. Spare me.What they do good in this movie is give Elektra some human traits to go with her badassness. She has OCD, which is evident when she's seen washing her floor and we're told that she's always doing this. There are two more scenes where she has OCD behavior, and this was very interesting.I also liked that Elektra's personality had changed from the Daredevil movie and in the end she somewhat returns to a more emotional person.This movie is not trash, but some things will have your head scratching. The villains had interesting powers, but they were not interesting enough. And why did they turn to green dust? And why did one bad guy suddenly pop up from nowhere when he wasn't even in the previous scene where all the villains were plotting their attack? This is a rental at best, and the DVD was not impressive because no comic book history was implanted into it.",Elektra
123,Adpag,One of the worst of the year,1,10 June 2005,"I must have watched a different version of Elektra from the one receiving praise here. I thought it began in mediocre fashion and trickled steadily downhill. I think Garner has good stuff in her but she was wasted in this. So tedious and toe-curlingly awful in every respect that I was looking for reasons not to turn off from round about the halfway mark - and I'm a tolerant viewer. I'm a film fan so I'll watch bad films as well as good. And as for the 'action', a term I used loosely - I actually gave up on this somewhere in the middle of what I think was supposed to be a climactic fight.

126,T1Thousand,Did Not Feel Much Elektra-city,6,15 January 2005,"Oh, where do I start with this movie? Hmm, well first off I did not care much for Elektra in Daredevil, but I decided to give this a chance since the effects at least looked promising. It started off okay--gave us an insight to how Elektra's ways were. But then it becomes annoying. Okay, Elektra had a pure heart, but at least give her some time to become attached to others as she does in this film. She's been an assassin for all this time. We see so many flashbacks of her past that we do not get to see any of the characters develop at all, and that is surely horrible because the bad guys are some cool people. They left me longing for more screen time with them. But no--we have to deal with the extremely irritating girl who becomes fond of Elektra and bear with all the unrealism that follows. The bad guys--highly skilled assassins-- want some people dead, but when they have their chances to kill them, they decide to waste time and talk. Sigh... And to top that all off, most of the events here are predictable. But on the upside, I will continue with what I said on the very cool villains. They had some interesting powers of which we don't get enough. The fight scenes and effects are really good, but too brief as well. It seems like they really rushed this movie and wanted to get it over with quickly. Garner does a fair job in playing Elektra, but I could not help and see her as Sydney from Alias most of the time because she usually just does the same facial expressions. But aside from that, the story was not bad--it actually had potential. If they would have focused less on Elektra's past and feelings (and made her atmosphere a little darker) and developed the characters some more, we could have had quite an interesting film. But I must say that I was going to give this movie a 'C,' but the amazingly remarkable character of Tattoo brought it up one point. His abilities were very eye-catching. Perhaps if he and the other bad guys he hung out with were shown more, we would have had a heck of a show. But I did not feel much elektra-city with any of the characters or the short fight scenes. Oh well. This movie is worth watching if one is a fan of Elektra and/or for the cool special effects and action. In my case, it was for Tattoo =)5.6/10 Stars",Elektra

I thought seeing come back from the dead and in training would have been more than just flashbacks. I guess the fans of the comics would know all that anyway.I don't think it should be compared to Daredevil really. I came out of that film thinking it was more like Batman in some ways. Sure it was a spin-off but most of the other spin-off's had something to do with the original.The story was cool, as was the film.

It seems like tried to go the comic book route but the director couldn't have read many comics. There should have been great action/fights in this but there weren't. They actually came up with some cool villains, the stone man, the guy who could animate his tattoos, the plague woman, etc but there were no fights. Basically there would be a set up, then boom! one kick, or one throw and it was over. The one extended fight scene was done in a place where big white sheets were floating around so you didn't actually see anything. Was that supposed to be artsy?

I rented this, watched it at home, and both my wife and I agreed that this was a pointless, stupid, and BORING movie. How anyone can mention ""great acting"" and ""Jennifer Garner"" in the same sentence with a straight face is, frankly, beyond me. If you want to see her ""great acting"", check the scene where her sensei, Terence Stamp, expels her from his school - her priceless reaction shots will remind you of either a colicky baby or of sucking on a lemon! Flashback after flashback are presented, with Garner looking soulful and pensive as the trauma of her life is presented to us except that all you'll feel is abject boredom and/or an intense desire to eject this DVD and watch ANYTHING ELSE. Once again, Hollywood execs have created yet another movie whose only reason for being is to:A. showcase some cool digital effectsandB. show an attractive young actress acting out the teenaged-boy-fantasy of the warrior woman who can kick ass while dressed in an outfit that is so ridiculous small and tight that she'd probably pop right out of it after throwing one kick!Hollywood is now so convinced that anything comic book-related will make a great movie, they don't realize that just because something works on a four-color printed page doesn't mean that it will work on a movie screen. Maybe this bomb, along with ""Catwoman"", ""The Punisher"" (the version with Dolph Lundgren and the version with John Travolta), and ""Sin City"" (yes, I know everyone seems to be falling all over themselves as they orgasmically praise it to the heavens but it's a crappy, self-conscious stab at film noir that comes across as forced, pompous, and downright laughable) will finally stop them from trying to transplant beloved characters to a new medium without trying to understand what makes them work in the first place.",Elektra

131,Brent_P,Lost in the mediocrity of other comic movies.,5,10 May 2007,"I'll admit it, I avoided this film like a George Clooney flick over the past two years on two accounts. 1] It was a soft sequel to Daredevil. 2] I was unaware of the Elektra's comic book history and did not know she was actually resurrected in the comics. I originally thought they brought her back for the purpose of the film. I was also a never been a big fan of the Alias series, but found to enjoy it sometime after it got canceled. To my surprise, Elektra was not THAT bad. After many failed attempts of converting several comic in to theater blockbuster, this one is...okay. That is, if you can somehow erase Daredevil from your memory banks.Elektra takes place a few years after her death. Now resurrected, she's a hired assassin that pits herself against a terrorist/ninja organization known as the The Hand after she backs off an assignment. Amongst The Hand carries a few unique characters with some interesting powers...one which is able to conjure up beasts from the tattoos covering his body.This film is nowhere close to Daredevil and should not even be uttered in the same sentence. The plot is a bit cliché similar to the Replacement Killers with a dash of Crouching Tiger, but it is simple and interesting enough to keep you entertained. The special effects looked pretty good and were not overdone. The fight/action scenes weren't too shabby either and weren't as much cheese as you expect from a comic movie...which may have been my only real complaint. I had a tough time rating this film higher than a 6 because I just felt bored. There were too many long dialog moments in the movie and fight scenes may have been too short.After doing some more research, the film was actually pretty close to comic, which is a plus.

133,CC_The_Martian,The only good thing about this movie is how forgettable it is,1,4 April 2016,"For some ungodly reason someone decided to make a spin off movie about Elektra, the weakest aspect of the Daredevil movie. This movie is one of most cliché I have ever seen; every bad Ninja movie cliché and every bad woman led action movie cliché is here with a few more for good measure. This movie also criminally waists a great cast; Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, Terence Stamp and Jason Isaacs all need to fire their agents immediately as they are all given weak throw away parts where they do nothing to improve the stories, this is especially infuriating as the actors who they got to fill all the major parts simply do not care. The queen of apathy is none other then our leading lady Jennifer Garner herself who gives a performance that puts Jennifer Lawrence and Kristen Stewart to shame. But there is one aspect of this movie that is particularly bad. One aspect that changes this movie from simply bad to awful. Fans of MST3K will be aware of a simple yet evil process called Hypno-Helio-static-stasis, this is the process by which a normal generic movie is made unbearable by making it as slow as a slug wading through a pool of honey. It was believed this process as forgotten as some point after the 1960s but is appears that the creators of Elektra are familiar with this process and used it to make this film one of most painful viewing experiences in this book. This is the first movie made in the 2000s that actually reminded me of a Coleman Francis movie. Throw in generic music, terrible animation and sub-par camera-work and you've got this unbearably generic movie that is painful to sit through but is mercifully forgettable once you've seen it.",Elektra
134,worship_HIM97,Great movie but definitely could have been better...,8,7 July 2005,"This movie really was a great movie, but there are definitely things that I would have liked better. For starters, Elektra is not a hero! People need to get that out of their heads. She is an assassin, and she'll fight for either side, depending on who hires her. That's not a hero, and for any of you that saw the movie but did not read the comic and you believe her to be a hero, I don't blame you. That's what the movie portrays her as being, and she isn't.Jennifer Garner was definitely not a good choice for Elektra at all. She did do a great job, but physically, there are many other actresses that could have done better. Don't make the mistake of believing that I don't like Jennifer Garner, because I do. She is a great actress, and she is beautiful, especially in this movie, but for this part, Sandra Bullock would have been great. They should have used her from the start, which was obviously 2003's Daredevil. Garner was good, but like I said, there were other actresses that probably could have been better.Whether or not Elektra continued to be an assassin or started living her life again is not official, but it is up to you to decide. The movie purposely leaves it as something that you have to decide for yourself. Another thing that I would like to comment on is that Jennifer Garner had to have had a stunt double, because at the end of the movie when Kirigi throws her to the other side of the room, you can easily see that it is not Jennifer Garner, which is another thing that brings the value of the movie down.The acting was pretty good, and the soundtrack is excellent. Bands such as Jet, Strata, The Donnas, Taking Back Sunday, Evanescence, and Switchfoot can all be heard on the album, which was released by Wind-Up Records. If you are debating whether to see the movie or not, I would say to see it. It is a very good movie. I'm just disappointed that the film made Elektra out to be a hero. This is, by the way, much better than Daredevil.8/10!",Elektra
135,FilmLover-4,Better than you might think,7,21 February 2005,"I went to this movie at the dollar theater with my 12-year-old daughter and a couple of her friends. This is a power chick flick that overdelivers on the panned critical reviews. I thought it was a solid B all the way across. The story was interesting, the special effects quite good, and Jennifer Garner in a those outfits is not a bad visual. The ""Treasure"" Abbey did a very good job, too. Thus, pleasantly surprised.IMDb requires me to write more lines, though I don't have a lot more to say. I guess the only other thing would be that I would like the ""old man"" teacher of Elektra to be more defined, to know more about his background and where he came from, etc.",Elektra
136,Vlad_the_Reviewer,Boring,3,17 March 2007,"Hollywood at its best: offering nothing more but shallowness.Few cheap CGI effects: nothing to see here, really. Only a handful of flying objects. A martial arts movie: not a single actor is good in martial arts (or isn't allowed to show it by the director). Shaky camera movement to disguise they can't fight. It's an old cheap trick.Acting: only the lady in red acts decently but we know she can do ten times better.Character build-up: none whatsoever. I believe there was an attempt though.Plot/Storyline: I think I got it the first time, no need to keep repeating flashbacks.",Elektra
137,AndreasHardcastle,Nice popcorn cinema without much depth,7,1 April 2005,"It's got everything you need if you are looking for some light, mindless popcorn action cinema. The hero in doubt, some people who have to be saved, the really evil villains and the regular wise old man.I feel like they tried to get to what Elektra is really about but got to distracted by trying to explain the other characters. It's like Elektra, Elektra... whoops, have to quickly throw in some lines about somebody else... Elektra... damn, here's another quicky about somebody else... and so on and so on. After the movie you know a bit about Elektra, almost nothing about the oh so important Abby they call ""the treasure"" and hardly anything really about the villains and what ""The Hand"", the evil organization who wants to obtain the treasure, is.The action is OK. Looks to me as if the director wanted to create a music video instead of a movie but as cynic as that may sound... it would have been a good video clip ;-). The choreography is nothing mind blowing but not too boring either, nicely paced.All in all it is the kind of movie you shouldn't watch with any expectations. Invite a couple of friends over, grab a six pack, put some potato chips on the couch table, turn off your brain and lean back.Comparison to Dare Devil: This could become a matter of religion, I enjoyed Dare Devil much more and in my humble opinion the fight scene choreography and the general mood was more intense and the cut is way above Elektra. On the other hand the Elektra character gives more room for acting, therefore Jennifer Garner looks less wooden than Ben Afflek in Dare Devil. But whatever you might say, in Dare Devil you don't have the feeling the movie is on the run to get through with it.",Elektra
138,hipcheck,"I WANTED to like it, I really did",3,23 April 2005,"A vote of four is not appreciative of what I've just watched, but in my heart this is a one, because it answers one question better than any other comic movie: ""how could you possibly screw up material this good?"" I honestly can't say how a comics neophyte would come into this experience, but the context was quite loaded for me. I've been an Elektra fan since her first appearance in Daredevil comics, and over time, she became simply my favorite character. Even years after my days of actively reading comics, I still feel as attached to her as any fictional character in comics, film or literature.She is truly archetypal -- the ultimate duel of good an evil inside the heart of one person. So strong, yet so vulnerable. So icy cold, yet the most passionate fire is locked up inside. She's the perfect manifestation of a rose, so beautiful, but with the sharpest thorns... even the most careful handler can't help but get hurt.As much of an Affleck fan as I am not, I really didn't mind the Daredevil movie too much, and didn't even mind the odd casting of Garner as Elektra, so it really disappointed me how much this movie failed to hit the mark on some of the greatest comics stories ever created.The Elektra Saga is pretty close to the pinnacle of comic book mastery. It's raw Frank Miller weaving such fantastic tales... the story, the art, the dialogue, it's just so adaptable. That series of books was so ripe for 1-3 films, it's sick. I just can't imagine how it could have been turned into this movie. Not with Avi Arad and his track record. Not after seeing Sin City, a complete masterpiece of comic adaptation.To get a little specific, I enjoyed Stick, the little girl, and that's about it. Tattoo and Typhoid Mary are alright, but the rest is just so hollow when weighed against its parent material.It's too bad this didn't come after Sin City, it really breaks my heart! Sin City has been successful enough that people can finally see that Frank Miller is the one to adapt Frank Miller, and he should have a say in any way that his material is put onto the screen. Perhaps we weren't ready with Robocop2, and Batman was credited to Tim Burton, but let's hope that from here on out, Hollywood and Frank can get along, because I personally can't stand the idea of another Elektra tragedy.",Elektra
139,Stefanowich,Awful!,1,26 March 2005,"I'm an old fan of the Daredevil franchise, the comic that is, and have been secretly in love with Elektra since childhood. A couple of years ago came Daredevil the movie, with ...eeehhh, Ben Affleck as Daredevil and Jennifer Garner as Elektra. They both sucked. Thankfully Colin Farrel managed to picture Bullseye in a somewhat decent way. Then came The Punisher, the next anti-superhero of the Daredevil-franchise. The Punisher outperformed Daredevil in every category. Hey, even the old Dolph Lundgren-Punisher-movie outperformed Ben Affleck do-ooh-dude-Daredevil. And now we have Elektra as well in her own movie. In the cartoon Elektra is a deadly assassin without any remorse. In the motion picture Jennifer Garner is Elektra; crybaby with lots of makeup, red panties and a romance(!) waiting around around the corner. Where did Elektra the ASSASSIN go? Elektra is one fine example of how a good comic book-franchise hits rock bottom when transfered to the big screen. Stay away! Star far far away!!",Elektra
140,markjbuchanan,Not nearly as bad as you've heard,7,1 May 2005,"Admittedly I usually like movies that the critics don't but to be honest I can't see what was so wrong with this movie to begin with. Jennifer Garner's a highly likable and believable action heroine (anyone who doubts that should watch ""Alias""), and the storyline was pretty good by comic book movie standards - sure this is no X-Men 2 (considered by many fans of the genre to be the best comic book movie ever) but it does alright on its own. I'm wondering if the failure of this movie has more to do with the public's aversion to super heroine movies (witness the deserved failure of Catwoman and the second Tomb Raider movie)? In any event, I stand by my liking of this movie - critics be damned.",Elektra
141,dimitriskats,Never saw the end,3,21 June 2005,"The best part of this film is its poster. In it you can see the square facial lines of the starring character, very interesting, BUT! The story doesn't exist. The dialogs are empty words. The backgrounds are good for nothing. I just couldn't get to the end of this film. Sorry Elektra, but my vote of 3 goes not to your acting, but to your training hours with the Sais. There is nothing to be gained from this viewing experience. Have you ever heard of bad commercial products? Well, this is the official definition. Keep clear. There are movies to be seen and there are movies better left alone. This Elektra tragedy is definitely of the latter kind. By the way ""Daredevil"" wasn't as bad as some would make you think.",Elektra
142,Stoli_Raz_N_7,I never thought I'd rate a Marvel movie so low...,5,22 March 2005,"I never thought that I'd see the day when I rated a Marvel movie so low...and I especially didn't think it would be Elektra. I mean, as a fan of the comic, I thought, ""Now this is gonna be a good movie. It's about Elektra. It's from the same guys (almost) that brought us Daredevil. It's Marvel. And Jennifer Garner is in it, wearing a tight red-leather outfit no less.""Could I have foreseen that the story would've been written so pathetically? Or that Rob Bowman could have done such an atrocious job of directing the film? Or that there could be so much stupidity involved with the action sequences? Could I have foreseen that some of the best villains to grace the pages of comic books could have been so poorly translated to the screen? No. I am amazing, but I am not psychic.I thought the producers used test audiences to screen films before they're released. Apparently not in this case, unless they tested it on a bunch of brain-damaged Vietnam vets.Here's a few examples of how bad the action could be: Stone is one of the five villains Elektra must fight. He's big, strong, and nearly invulnerable, so much so that he's immune to shotgun blasts from point blank range. Yet Elektra drops a tree on him, and *poof* he's gone. Another one of the bad guys, Kinkou is taken out so quickly that you wonder why he was ever in the film to begin with. Then we come to my two favorites from the comic, Typhoid and Tattoo. Tattoo certainly seemed much cooler in the comics. In the film, he goes out like a chump. And Typhoid...in the comic she is a super badass chica. In the movie, she's just dumb.Okay, that being said, let's move onto deconstructing the film's construction. The action sequences were poorly edited, failed to flow, and the slow-motion sequences were platitudinous to the point of nausea. The fight choreography was pretentious and lame. The drama was too drawn out to be appreciated. Overall, the film was almost totally joyless and inappreciable. Except for Jennifer Garner in the tight red-leather outfit.",Elektra

Having read the rave reviews here under User Comments, I'm beginning to wonder if there's something wrong with me (although there is some hope a la Iron Monkey). My reaction to Elektra?Underwhelmed is probably the best adjective - although boring runs it close.Opening credits and voice over suggest the battle of good versus evil, yet very early on we discover that Elektra is actually nothing more than an assassin for hire. And we discover this whilst Elektra is on her knees cleaning her apartment to get rid of evidence of her DNA ...Mmm.Then we are exposed to a tedious scenario of Elektra protecting 'The Treasure' from the supposedly 'evil' group The Hand and a wholly unbelievable romantic liaison. The thing that stuck in my mind was that Elektra had a habit of rather easily losing those she was suppose to protect - she gets somewhat easily separated in the forest, and then again in the maze. As for the antiheroes. Risible. So easily dispensed.All in all a complete embarrassment for all concerned.",Elektra
147,Vipex23,Dreadful Movie. Worst Marvel Film.,3,16 January 2005,"Some Spoilers in this review: For the life of me I can't understand how so many people here claim they like this movie. While watching the movie I couldn't wait for it to end. Unlike all the other Marvel movies, there was absolutely no character development at all. All the villains seem to have supernatural powers which are never really explained. (One guy has animals come out of his chest. One woman seems to be an exact duplicate of Poison Ivy from Batman, minus any personality, etc, etc.) There's really no explanation as to how the girl she's protecting became the ""Treasure"" and just seemed like an annoying brat.Since there wasn't any character development, I couldn't care less about any of the characters. There's no emotional attachment between the viewer and the person on screen. Elecktra, unlike in Daredevil, was a cold fish in this movie barely showing any emotion. Then, most absurd of all, you have Elektra's assistant, whose only purpose is to make money, give up his life for two people he barely knows! As bad as the plot is, the action scenes were nearly just as terrible. Consider the scene in the forest. You have a guy who has a tree fall on his head that he knocks down! Totally ridiculous. Then you have the final fight scene in which Elektra was losing the battle. She gets up off the ground after being knocked out, puts up her sai and the main villain (who has unexplained teleporting powers) runs into it impaling himself. Completely stupid.In conclusion: Go watch Daredevil for a second time instead of seeing this because that, unlike this, is a good movie.3/10",Elektra
148,docstrange,A great action film with lots of heart...,9,21 January 2007,"Jennifer Garner is awesome as Elektra. The acting of young Kirsten Prout was equally impressive. She was a perfect choice for the role of Abby. Their relationship is a central element of the plot and is exceptionally well handled. I would have liked to have seen even more of their personal interaction. The Abby character has some great scenes with a very cool and unusual weapon, and they both come up against some of the most imaginatively conceived enemies in any movie ever. No generic black-clad baddies here; every one of these bad guys is unique and poses a special danger.Many big action movies, like Ratner's relentlessly hyperkinetic ""X-Men:The Last Stand"", suffer from a lack of just such character development.Elektra is beautifully filmed, a real work of art. The costumes and sets are exquisite, even though it was made for a relatively modest $40 million. I would love to see a sequel, with Elektra and Abby fighting side by side.I'm sure many people went into the theatre expecting the sort of huge cast, non-stop explosions and widespread landscape demolition that seem to be required elements in action films these days. The IMDb rating score I thinks reflects this, more than the actual content or quality of the movie. There's plenty of action, but it's an action movie with heart.I feel that this film deserves a much better score than the current average score of 5.1. It was a lot more entertaining, and of far higher quality, than a lot of more popular films.This is the same Elektra character seen in the very mediocre movie ""Daredevil. Here, her character and backstory are fleshed out, and we have a chance to get to really know her.I have a theory: if you discount the votes of all the trolls, troglodytes, and conservative Neanderthals who will never give an action movie with a female lead a score higher than a 5, this movie would have a combined rating of 7 or more.",Elektra

150,smartbomb,"Half good, half unforgivably bad",5,11 March 2005,"I rated this movie 5/10, which seemed kind of harsh for a movie whose first half I enjoyed so much. I liked the initial introduction to the character, her ""agent"", even the condensed backstory as flashbacks. I didn't even mind her relationship with the girl and her father (though it really doesn't make sense given that the character is psychotic; she's an assassin for crying out loud,) because it was handled surprisingly well.As the movie progresses however, little stupid things and inconsistencies start cropping up. You try not to notice because overall things are going well. But when it comes time for the real action, it's a bit of a letdown (the ""sheet fight"" was dumb, there was too much running through the forest and the maze, and Elektra seems to become incompetent and needs to be rescued a number of times.)I think the main problem is the inclusion of too many mystical elements and the attempt to humanize Electra too much. The film would've worked better if it were more grounded in reality to provide a more realistic sense of tension. Elektra the character is supposed to be enigmatic - an unapproachable, unfathomable killer. Yet by the end of the movie I felt like I was watching Sidney from Alias.",Elektra

153,joits,so bad...,5,18 January 2005,"There's so many reasons why this movie is bad. Here's a few I can think of at the moment.-It wastes the talents of the always amazing Jennifer Garner. She's been in quite a few stinkers now but somehow she still delivers a great performance. So the people behind Elektra have a great actress signed on... the least they could have done was put more effort into the story. Of course, if she read the script and THEN signed on... well...-The story. The reluctant assassin thing again? C'mon. If they had to copy the story of other action movies, it should have at least been that she assassinated some dude's son and he goes after her and all hell breaks loose...-The action/fighting scenes. Yet again, another movie that does a terrible job with the frantic camera work to go along with quick,close cuts so that we can't really see anything but are forced to believe that there's an intense fight scene in the progress... where the camera man seems to be involved in it. Jennifer Garner is a pro at movie martial arts. She does it week in and week out on the set of Alias, show us what she can do!! Pull the camera back, tell the editor to chill out, knock the camera man out and set that camera on a tripod, teach Jennifer Garner and her co-stars some moves, and the let the good times roll. Cos at least if the story sucks, we can be entertained by the action. Also, I wish there was more of it! -The love story. Umm... what? She's supposed to be this hard-ass assassin... but she falls for some guy on the second night she meets him, even tho according to the dialogue shown on screen gives her character no reason to like his character. Stupid.-The villains. I know they want to maintain a PG-13 rating... but why all the poofing when the die. Kinda gives the impression that they are filled with some kind of stinky gas. Unless this is how it is in the comics, if it was, some kind of explanation would be helpful otherwise me and other non-comic book readers would think the bad guys are basically balloons filled with fart gas. I've seen other movies that have been able to maintain a PG-13 rating and still show actual deaths. And the villains were terrible!! That fool with them tattoos is useless... he's comatose while his animal tattoos are loose?? And the guy who can withstand a big ass shot gun from close range and dies, I mean poofs, when a tree falls on him. What's up with that? I'm not arguing about the various physics involved with a gun shot and a tree, but the gun shot was supposed to tell the audience that Stone... was built like one. It just seems like a stupid way to kill a character after showing us that he's bullet proof. The poison girl... useless... but hot... so at least we got more eye candy. The main bad guy... not bad but again, the fight scene was stupid.Lots more... but those are the ones that really stand out for me.",Elektra

Unfortunately, the movie left me very disappointed & somewhat confused with the fact I spent money on watching it. I ain't the only one with such feelings here, cause viewers in the theater were constantly leaving, even the guy who was sitting in front of me & looked amazingly like Jack Osbourne had a hard time making it to the end. For me the temptation to leave was one of the strongest since Kangaroo Jack.The story is awful: at the end, what could've been an original movie, turns into a bad cocktail of X-Men, Mortal Combat & an average Venezuelan soap opera. It seems the director himself is aware of the fact that the movie is cheesy & tries to do whatever he can to improve it by the following things: using stale special effects, even when they're totally irrelevant; using lame martial arts & (TA DA!) even one of the recent trump cards of the modern showbiz - a lesbian kiss!

It's better late than never, for a movie made in 2005, that's 16 years late.I had a lot of high hopes for Elektra, sizing up from Alias, boy was I wrong. I had thought it was a great Super-hero movie, since it's a Marvel character. From the first kiss she had with the father of the girl, it went all downhill for me. Every time they got close I keep thinking don't kiss, don't kiss.This turned out to be another run of the mill, action, sexy heroine with a troubling past, seeking answers. She turns out to be a weak, motherly, romantic figure, with a soft spot for a girl that reminded her of herself. The girl is almost like a twin to her, if she is not so young.

Special effects, exaggerated Martial Arts, good sceneries and Jennifer's sexiness - none of them could save the grace in this movie.In Daredevil, JG stole the show only because Ben Affleck made a terrible superhero. After acting in the TV show ALIAS for 4 years, her Martial Arts skills kick ass and so does her acting. But in Elektra, there was hardly any acting, lot of slow pauses (like in Hulk) with OK music playing in the background with an Asian touch, soothing and mellow enough to substitute a lullaby. The portrayal of a modern day good vs evil battle, right vs wrong does not seem to work here. Ninja fighters with way too many extraordinary powers did not fit either. Only Natasia Malthe (who sizzled on the Stuff magazine cover in 2004) showed some hotness to the movie. Carey Tagawa, Wil Yun Lee, Terrence Stamp and Jason Isaacs were totally wasted.Overall I gave the movie a 3/10. I hope Jennifer Garner just sticks to ALIAS, smiles a little more, kick ass at the right time and make some better movie selection in the time to come.",Elektra

I not only got to see more of Elektra and her sais (which I loved to death as well as my new top 10 favorite character Elektra) but I got to compare her relationship with Mark Miller to her relationship with Matt Murdock. Plus I loved the villains in this movie. They were all so cool, especially Tattoo. (Spoiler alert!!) I liked Kirsten Prout as Abby, although I did notice that she was breathing when she was supposed to be dead. I practically loved Goran Visjnic (I hope spelled that right) as Mark Miller. I loved Terence Stamp as Stick. He was comical at times. I give this film a 10/10. Anyone who has a problem with my comment or my score can eat Brussels sprouts.",Elektra

Well, unless you are an Elektra buff and have read the comic books (which I haven't) you don't know what the heck is going on. Who are these bad guys and why do they want Elektra dead... Who is the girl and their father... why did they kill Elektra's mom? What happened to her Dad? The questions that this film raises are seemingly endless. I hope the DVD edition releases a lot of missing footage which will give us the character depth and history behind these people that is so badly needed to make this a film that is worthy of watching.",Elektra
161,deltahotel,Waste of time,4,5 May 2008,"This movie was a complete waste. As for superhero movies, this one is the worst in my opinion, worse even than Superman III. This film makes Superman III look like an Oscar Award-winning masterpiece. That is to say that if you showed up at the theater one day and they were showing both Elektra and Superman III, I recommend Superman III in a heartbeat. This film had a very weak, choppy plot. This film made a mockery of every good thing they built up in Daredevil. Don't waste your time or money on this film. Sell it back if you bought it. This can be accomplished by going to ebay.com and creating an account. Once this is complete, take a picture of the DVD and import it to ebay's web site, creating a listing that will enable other users to waste their money on the film, perpetuating the misery around God's green earth.

If you like action, fighting special effects, and a variety of characters (although not very developed) then give this movie a chance. The only reason I think it does have such a low score is because of comic fans (like me) think that every comic movie should be exactly like the comic or comics it was based on. But where is the fun in that? The X-Men and Spider-man movies definitely were not exactly like the comics and they were still good as movies. Is this the greatest comic adapted film? Hells no!

When I first picked up this movie at Hollywood Video, I thought it would be a fun chick flick and gave it a Hell's chance. While I was watching the film,it was a major disappointment. The film was too jumpy, which is my term for little to no solid explanation and often skipping from one thing to another thing which sometimes has nothing to do with the movie or confusing. Anyway, enough about my feelings about this movie, time for a little description about the plot. This movie talks about Elektra, who is a hired assailant in the beginning of the movie. Soon, she meets a family and decides to save them from The Hand, an evil group of wacko killers. The only thing I enjoyed about this movie was Jennifer Garner. Her going around kicking ass in a hot red suit. Please, do not fall for the publicity and over generous comments about this movie, AVOID AT ALL COSTS",Elektra

So I'm thinking ""Hey, why don't we make a movie about her?"". Yeah, I know she died in the other one but we'll fix that. And we want her to be supercool so we'll make her a cold-blooded assassin. Well no, no, not totally cold-blooded, she'll have these vague inner turmoils. We can do a lot of those shots on her staring straight ahead emotionlessly that were so popular in 'Alias'. With soaring music. What's that? Well I know she can't really act but she's gorgeous so we'll just give her some tight outfits. What? Okay, we'll put her in some fashionable business-wear as well ---- in scenes where she counsels a young girl who's kind of her protégé. Well she won't know it but we'll make sure it's obvious to the audience real early. And we'll have to have some supercool villains - just pick a handful from the comic. And one should be a hot chick. Oh, there's one that can sap life by kissing? Perfect, we'll have her kiss Elektra for a full five seconds so the teenage boys can get their ya-yas. But it won't kill her, she'll stop early. And we can do a real cool fight scene in a room full of flying sheets like they did in that artsy movie. But again she'll escape when the bad guy just stops using an attack even though it's working extremely well. We can do lots of character development - what? well we won't make it real talky - we can just have her mope around a lot. How will she kill the bad guys? Oh, we'll figure that out later as there will not be a lot of time left for that anyway. And we'll get one of those famous serious British actors to play some kind of mentor. And the girl can have a hot father that Elektra falls for. We'll just get one of those guys from another network seriodrama. If this works, we can get a sequel where she meets up with the Charmed Ones and their studs for a total CGI fest.",Elektra
166,freddi1,One of the few good comic book movies,7,17 January 2005,"I have to admit: I was impressed. I checked a few comments and the IMDb rating before I saw it, I also saw the 1st minute of the movie and some trailers ... and I consider this a good movie.No need for any excuses like ""Dont expect too much, its from a comic book"" or something like that, I really enjoyed it: Jennifer Garner is an excellent kick-ass superhero I would compare to Lara Croft's Angelina Jolie, she acted believable looked awesome. The shots in general were convincing and well chosen, the visual effects were OK, but not that breathtaking any more (hey, we live in the post-Matrix and StarWars I/II time now). The villains worked out great and though there might be some plot holes here and there, the story was not not as clumsy as in other superhero movies (or movies in general), though I did not like the (somehow obligatory for superhero characters) romance part. A little less of that and a little more of the action scenes, and I would rate it 7+.If you liked Tiger & Dragon, The Matrix 1 and Spiderman you should definitely take a look at ""Elektra"".",Elektra
167,bdavis-5,"A disappointing, unfortunate mess.",5,16 January 2005,"My rating is 5 of 10.I am sorry to say this because I wanted it to be good. I liked ""Daredevil"", and I was impressed with the reports of how hard Jennifer Garner worked on ""Elektra"". (I've always liked Jennifer Garner, anyway.)The cast is not at fault. I don't think that the director is primarily at fault, either. My guess is that the editor, perhaps under direction from the studio, is the villain. Virtually all references to ""Daredevil"" have been eliminated. I remember no scene showing how Stick got her dead body after the events of ""Daredevil"". And since those emphatically took place in New York City, where is this story set? It sort of looks like Japan and Washington State. (The film was actually made on the south coast of my beautiful province of British Columbia, of course.) The dramatic events of her initial time with Stick are merely skimmed over. There is no explanation of how she is able move from one place to another in an instant. There is no explanation of what the powers of the main villain are. There is no explanation of what happens after she kills him and the other members of The Hand. Is the ""war"" over, then? If so, then why doesn't she settle down with the father of the girl, or go back to Matt Murdock? And there are plenty of other questions and omissions. With all of the consequent lack of back story and context, by the time the climax arrived, I had little interest in the scenes apart from the action in the fights. OK, as a man, I'll admit it - and how good Garner looked and acted.Still, there are some good things. The flashbacks showing how her father was hard on her give insight into her character. (But there was no mention of how he was killed by Bullseye.) Elektra's OCD seems plausible and interesting. The action scenes were slickly shot (although they often lacked continuity). Jennifer Garner delivered an outstanding performance. Kirsten Prout looks she has the potential to have a good career as an adult. But they and the rest of the cast deserved better from those in charge of this production.If there is a director's cut on DVD, then I am sure that it will be a better movie. It looked to me like a good movie had been filmed, then edited to death. I wonder what actually happened.",Elektra

The story was self contained enough, while still giving the feeling of being part of a much greater whole...I also liked the portrayal of Stick, though he's only a small part in the film.There was one little plot point that annoyed me a bit, regarding the fate of one of the characters...

Gardner gives Elektra heart and soul. This movie is like the Punisher(the new movie) and Mortal Kombat(the first one)roll into one good package. Definitely and franchise type of film. Each actor or actress played their roles well especially the young girl who seemed to have great chemistry with Gardner. I look forward to seeing Elektra 2 and Daredevil 2.If you know who comes back to play our favorite blind superhero.Action just looks amazing in this picture.

171,Nicol_Bolas,"It had potential, but the cast and crew screwed it up.",4,25 September 2006,"There are movies that you watch, where, after the experience of viewing them, you have to ask: how did this get made? Because you can't imagine a universe where any of the ideas presented in the movie worked. Where the plot was at all legitimate. Where this movie could have been good and was ruined by something.That's not this movie. (note: that would be Catwoman) There were actually some good ideas in this film. Sure, the brutal assassin who is redeemed by a child and finds her conscience has been done time and again. And this version would probably not be better than The Professional/Leon. But, at least, it was following in the footsteps of good films. It could have worked.Elektra fails, ultimately, because it is so very paint-by-numbers. You can actually read what every shot exists to try to tell you. The person she murders for a contract at the beginning? It exists entirely to establish her as a brutal assassin. The scene with her arguing with her agent over a new contract? That's to she that she's a hardass. Etc.All movies, technically, can be devolved to that level. Few, however, actually make it so obvious so as to have the person actually do that while watching the movie. Everything that happens in this movie is obvious.So, why do I say it had potential? Because, if you stripped out all facets of this movie, and gave the basic plot to another director&crew, you could have had something. The problem in this movie is that it fails on every level to execute those ideas with anything resembling grace or elegance. The movie starts at the beginning of a story and just lumbers along until the end. On the way, you get a couple of fight scenes and Jennifer Garner looking attractive in a few outfits.Speaking of Garner, at no time does she convince me that she's a cold-blooded killer. One reason for that may be because that introduction scene I was talking about spent more time discussing her character than actually showing her doing stuff. Indeed, at no time does she convince me of anything, except maybe that she looks nice in that red dress. She doesn't convince me that she cares about the girl she's saving, that she turns aside from killing, or that she's a credible martial artist. She simply looks like she doing all those things, but it's a thin veneer, and easily seen through.Everything that's wrong with this film must lie with the director. He's the one in charge of all aspects of production, and since all aspects of production failed equally, he therefore takes the blame.",Elektra
172,jpates-1,Better than expected,7,8 October 2006,"For all the bad I heard about this movie, I was pleasantly surprised. I had seen so many bad reviews and the fact it was a spin-off of Daredevil had made me very hesitant to see this movie. But as an action film, it had good fights. As a comic book based movie, it had some interesting villains.But there were a few problems I did have with this movie. Some parts of it felt rushed, while other parts felt drawn out. ***************POSSIBLE SPOILER****************************Unless this movie was meant to have a sequel, the movie wasn't complete. The head bad guy never even encountered the main character. Hopefully there is a sequel being thought of to remedy this situation.Also, I would have liked to have seen more of the character backgrounds of either Elektra or the family she was trying to protect.****************END SPOILER**********************************All in all, this was a good movie to pass some time with.

But the movie, while not doing justice to the classic comic version of Frank Millers creation, still ended up being fairly entertaining . Yes, things would have been so much better had they stuck to Rated R, had a faster pace, less villains and better character development. But it is still entertaining enough not to deserve these terrible reviews. I think someone who is not familiar with the comics has a better chance to enjoy the movie than a fan, since there were too many adaptations to make Elektra more palatable to the great audience. My wife is not a fan and enjoyed it. I am a long time fan since the 80s, gave it a 6.",Elektra
174,spudhalvorson,Finally Viewed After 10 Years,6,15 October 2015,"This is a greatly under-valued Marvel movie. As movies go, for me... the comic book genre is rarely going to get a 8, and not yet ever a nine. So, if I give Elektra a 6, this really isn't that bad. There are a number of critics here who speak ill of this movie on a number of levels, but I can assure you... superhero movies get far worse.The acting is good, with exception to Kirsten Prout's ""Abby"". The true fault in the film comes with the lack of backstory and plot development/explanation(s). Abby is the macguffin in this film, and a rather uninspiring one. The Elektra story apparently has a fantastical magical element to its backstory, but this is not explained. As a result, you've powerful villains using incredible magic (unexplained), who bother to use beautifully choreographed martial arts. Is the magic a trick of illusion? Magic is not explained, but does not appear to be wholly illusory. In all, a weak, and easily fixable plot hole.I believe many find fault with the film in that of the plot development that does occur, it is a slower paced development of Elektra dealing with her own demons. It does take a little to get going, but I thing this element of development is worth it. It is worth one view, but probably not one for your shelf.",Elektra
175,ktr8rmv814,Good movie,10,21 April 2006,"I'm going to have to disagree with the critics on this one.I can't believe that Elektra got such a bad score. I mean at least a high six for god sakes. This movie was a great action movie and Garner showed her physical abilities in this movie. The dialogue was a bit crisp sometimes and got a little thin with the usual martial arts ""You can do it"" and that type of inspiring stuff. The movie, overall, is very entertaining and the acting is good. There were a lot of great special effects. The editing was OK. There were complaints on how the main guy died... I thought the death could've been more elaborate and more vengeful. The story isn't bad at all. I guess it's just a matter of taste, if you like movies that are closer to the reality side, go watch another movie, if you're open to things that aren't really tied in with what's real, you might like this. It's action packed and plot-wise, well it's actually not that bad. Elektra is lost in morality and doesn't know who she is, by the ending she finds herself again... with the help of people along the way. The little love thing they had going, i don't know about that, there was hardly any chemistry although both actors were capable. The movie was well done and is good enough for me to be expecting a sequel, just keep in mind, this is more of the definition of Elektra and finding who she is. Maybe, in the next movie, if there is one, there'll be more sense of reality to it. Have fun with it.",Elektra

I personally thought Jennifer Garner was as wooden as Al Gore and Richard Nixon's love child, but she's sexy, so that goes a long way in forgiving that. The action was really good. The mystical abilities were a little strange, and I think too off balanced. What makes Stick and Kirigi so damn powerful? There's a guy who can summon demons from his tattoos, a girl who just destroys EVERYTHING with her breath, and a guy who was just Huge beyond compare and practically invincible, and all manner of other nonsense. The good guys have a necklace and a sexy red outfit. Personally, I'd want to be on the side of death girl. Elektra's and Kirigi's final battle was cool to watch, but once again, wtf? Kirigi can like move at light speed and apparently in the comics can heal himself from like any wound. And Elektra can beat him? nonsense. And death girl, she should be able to just kill everyone. And I notice the giant man is conveniently missing for the final battle. How funny since NO one could take him the first time around. Then there's stick and master roshi (DBZ anyone?) Why didn't they ever do anything? Want General Zod and friggen Shang Tsung to whip some butt! Who's with me on that one?? Seriously, who needs anything else? Put Electra in the background like getting undressed or something, and just have an epic battle ending with Tsung having to kneel before Zod! I'd pay ten bucks to see that. The best thing about that movie was seeing Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa back on screen. WHere the heck has he been since Mortal Kombat?

There's no reason to give an outline. There is nothing original in the concept; it's an all usually suspected and perfectly average mix of the most common elements in the genre. But how it is done!! In fact, this movie has everything. Action, tricks, superb technical brilliance, good acting, emotions, relevance - and and above all humor, in particular a disarming touch of self-irony; more than anything, the abrupt switches between superhuman capacities on part of the heroines and just ordinary human helplessness on part of precisely the same perfectly normal women in distress towards the end of this improbable adventure made me laugh out loud.This is a must-see, and possibly the very best movie of 2005.

It is a somewhat prototypical comic book-based movie with sub-par dialogue, mediocre acting and a jumpy plot; although, it's certainly not the worst movie of its genre I've seen so far (I think Spawn may have been worse). At least it wasn't dripping with idiotic sentimentality like the Spiderman series, although there is some. I will admit, there is some pretty good cinematography in the movie and the plot is somewhat intriguing, which probably kept it from tanking completely. I think, really, it just fell into the hole of lameness that nearly all comic book-based films inevitably fall into, with the exception perhaps of the new Batman series and maybe X-Men. Undoubtedly this is a genre that is simply not meant to be explored by most filmmakers. Unfortunately, as long as there is money to be made, we will probably see many more. What's next, I wonder?

182,stile1973,Weak,4,24 January 2007,"Elektra suffers from at least four major flaws: 1. The central character fails to develop a deep audience bond. There is little empathy for her character, and she isn't really that likable. The difficulty here for the writers is giving the character an aloofness and toughness that will still allow her to be a believable assassin, balanced with giving her enough humanity to allow the audience to develop a bond. This task is beautifully executed in Luc Besson's film ""Leon"" (The Professional).2. The plot is weak and old. Elektra embarks on a quest to save a father and his daughter from the mythic criminal organization the Hand. We've seen it before and it isn't all that engaging a story line.3. The fight sequences are lame - poorly choreographed and poorly filmed. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is an example of superbly executed fight sequences.4. The villains all have more interesting and more powerful abilities. Elektra is a skilled fighter with the Sai, but she has no real super-powers. This makes the villains the more engaging characters.Overall a weak attempt at converting an excellent comic book series into film. Disappointing at best. 4 out of 10.",Elektra

However now it almost seems like its the age of Comic Book Movies and that movies like this have been recently coming out a lot more frequently. This movie itself seems to be of a new genre on to itself (as far as comics). The movie like ""catwoman"" is a secondary character type movie in which the main character (daredevil, or Matt Murdock) is missing. Catwoman based off of the batman comics/movies was also a movie like this for that same reason but had bombed. Personally I think this movie on the other hand did a LOT better but can't be really considered ""perfect"". It had great plot elements or ideas, Amazing visuals, a very sexy Jennifer Garner, and as far as i've been told a ""pretty accurate"" characterization of Electra in comparison to the comics.

The plot was terribly carried out, and the acting wasn't so great. The characters sure were interesting but not much is known about them(unless you had read the comics). Still, Elektra brings nothing new to the comic book movie series and no wonder it flopped at the box office. Only hardcore fans of the Elektra comics will find this movie interesting. It truly had so much potential that unfortunately was not used to its greatest extent, Elektra suffers just like Catwoman did, so that goes to tell you that even if a popular and beautiful actress stars in a comic book adaptation , it won't necessarily be successful.",Elektra
185,sirguitarist,It should be a prerequisite on IMDb to WATCH a movie if you're gonna review it,9,6 July 2005,"After watching Elektra for the second time, I thought I would check the old IMDb to see what others thought. Obviously the votes are split down the middle with a near 5 out of 10 rating (as of this writing.) What frustrated me in the case of many of the negative reviews, which I am more than open to if they are objective, is the fact that some of the complaints registered about so-called unanswered questions in the story were indeed answered in the movie that I watched. Others complained about the plausibility (come on! it's fantasy!) and others complained about the lack of action sequences. All I could imagine was some of these people sitting in a theatre with a notepad, licking their chops, just dying to trash this movie and register their pseudo-cinematic-wisdom and revel in their sarcastic prose. *POSSIBLE SPOILERS*An example was someone stating how the mammoth Stone character was killed by Elektra jumping on his head. In the movie I watched this impact to the head was caused by a 2 ton 40 foot tree landing on it as it fell with Elektra astride on top. Another was complaining that Elektra's mother's death was not explained, but it was during a flashback scene where the Hand was seeking to capture Elektra in the same manner they were trying to capture The Treasure (and killed her mother also.) Another complained about Garner's lack of dialogue. This character was someone wrestling with several inner demons; the death of her mother, the fact that she herself had been killed and brought back to life, being apparently rejected by Stick, whom she trusted as a mentor and represented ""the only place I have to go."" A person with these kind of issues is not likely to be that talkative (and if they were, it would likely be so depressing, you wish they wouldn't talk!) The fact that she was wrestling with these problems was illustrated beautifully in the many flashback scenes. There was plenty of action and FX, but there was also a story. I thought it was well balanced all around.Some reviews seemed to trash it just for the sake of trashing it. Granted, this is not a masterpiece by a long shot, but it was excellent for its genre; Marvel superhero/action/martial arts/FX/popcorn flick. It was thoroughly entertaining and I will likely watch it a third time and then some. I cared about the characters and hated the bad guys, like you're supposed to in a story like this. I am not suggesting that you see this just because I liked it, but I AM suggesting that you don't pass it by because of some of the lame negative reviews here.

190,AllSunday,"Interesting Effort, but otherwise monstrously bad film",1,15 January 2005,"I work in a movie theater, I don't have to pay for any of the films I see, so I take advantage of this little perk and see as many movies as possible. I hear a lot about what people like and don't like, but, when you see as many movies as I do in a week, you learn to love everything. Every terrible film I have ever seen while being employed I usually find an upside to it. I rarely ever rate anything lower than a 5. Elektra on the other hand, was my first 0/10, and boy did it ever deserve it.Lack of story, any kind of character depth, and the cloud of dullness that surrounded the film at all times made Elektra almost impossible to be enjoyable. But, let me give you some background information on myself to see whether or not to take this review seriously. I am a huge fan of superhero movies. I actually found The 1988 Punisher remotely entertaining despite the overall crapiness of the film. I love the fact that Hollywood is shoving out Super Hero films seeing how it is one of my favorite genres. Same thing applies to my guest to Elektra, my 9 year old brother, who loves everything super hero. Although I did not like 2003's Daredevil at all, I went to Elektra because my brother begged me to take him, and I reluctantly gave in. Yet in the end, it was my little brother's idea to walk out of the film.(possible spoilers begin) The premise of the film is as follows: Jennifer Garner is once again reprising her role as Elektra, the love interest/femme fatal from Daredevil. I can't really tell you if Elektra even connects to the events in Daredevil, because I walked out before any explanation (if any)was given. Any hoo, being an assassin for hire, she is asked to wait in a lovely house on an isolated island before waiting for her next assignment. The dull and otherwise uninteresting Elektra had died in the past, revived now and with the power to see things before they happen making her a rather difficult foe. While waiting for her target's names, she quickly 'bonds' with her neighbors Mark Miller (Goran Visnjic) and his 13 year old daughter Abby (Kirsten Prout) who obviously has something to hide. After finding out that Mark and Abby are her targets, she doesn't kill them and decides to protect them from the sect of deadly powerful assassins after them, 'The Hand', who are after a special 'treasure'. The Hand eventually catches up to them, (introduces Tattoo, Typhoid, Stone, and some other pointless assassin, all who have very limited screen time) and it is revealed that Abby is the treasure, because she is a very powerful warrior, along with her father Mark, whom now suddenly has feelings for Elektra. Not much of a surprise, Elektra is injured from this fight and brought back to her place of training, and after a brief sparing session with Abby (Elektra being the winner), my brother told me he could not stand the movie anymore, and asked to go home. I couldn't agree more with him, for the movie had given me a headache. I can't really tell anyone how the 'amazing' climax of Elektra was, something I am very proud of, but I am still very surprised I managed to sit through an hour and 15 minutes of that mind-numbing crap.To wrap things up quickly, Elektra was NOT action packed, and was mostly nothing but pointless chit-chat between 1 dimensional characters. The scene transition from reality to flash back if very sloppy and confusing, and everyone attached to this film should be ashamed. Please don't go to this film, wasting money on a ticket price would only encourage Hollywood to make more trashy films like 'Elektra'. 0/10. Go to the Incredibles, or rent Spider-Man 2 instead.",Elektra
191,martinwlicht,Bad Script,4,23 November 2020,"Jennifer Garner's performance is pretty good and as convincing as it gets ... which isn't much because the bad writing is like a stone chained to her neck. She could have done a deep psychological portrayal if the script wouldn't be on such a high school level of writing.The romance is not convincing, and the plot is completely silly towards the second half of the movie. The bad CGI in the final fight only makes it worse. I don't even know what the evil guys actually wanted to achieve in the end.Whatever potential there was for a somewhat gritty and grounded Marvel movie that relied more on psychology rather than lavish world building, the opportunity is wasted and the movie isn't worth seeing even if you're aching for another MCU movie. I'm hoping 'Black Widow', another Marvel movie about a female assassin, will enjoy a better handling of the craft.This movie is a lecture in how talent can be wasted by bad conditions.",Elektra
192,lix,I will make this easy for you,8,15 January 2005,"The movie is entertaining... it doesn't try to be anything more than this and really, anyone who is looking for deep meaning in this movie should just not see it. The story isn't amazing, but it is perfect for this kind of film... the fight scenes are pretty awesome... the effects are good... the acting is fine (no ones does a bad job, that is for sure)... and Jennifer Garner is just so damn likable! She is beautiful, works hard, has a great body, and acts well with whatever roles she has been given. She can carry the movie just fine. Overall, for a comic book movie, it was enjoyable. I didn't like Daredevil at all, and JG was the only person that saved it for me. So, having said that, if you are interested in seeing the movie, then see it and form your own opinion. I must say, don't listen to the critics, they are being overly harsh and I definitely would not even once compare this to Catwoman (cause that movie was just total garbage, although funny for that reason).",Elektra
193,Ajarn_Cole,Loved it!!,7,27 February 2005,"Jennifer Garner did a fabulous job as Elektra, I think, mainly because she has a way of showing subtle facial expressions that make HUGE differences in the way she shows her true emotions. That plus her physical activities are AWESOME!! She was great in Alias!, but I like her even better on the big screen. GO JENNIFER!!! Can't wait for the next movie! ;-)The special effects were well done, and Terrence Stamp fit the part of Stick nicely. So many of the actors that were chosen for their parts were done perfectly, I feel. With this special blend of effects and Kung Fu action, I think Elektra should continue with additional episodes easily. It is unfortunate that Dare Devil didn't make such a smooth transition to the big screen. It had great potential, but just missed the mark.",Elektra
194,ninasaniston,Pop Corn,6,3 March 2021,"It's not the best film out there.

195,Savvas Stavrou,A Disappointing Failure,5,30 January 2005,"I honestly would have been the last person to say that Elektra was a disappointment. That is so because of my love for Daredevil (I thought it was fun, action-packed and with great music -- Evanescence are my favourite band and have been for 6 years). Also because I am, probably, the only person who liked Catwoman. Seriously, I thought it was a fun, enjoyable mindless movie with unbelievably amazing visuals. So after reading that, you're probably thinking that I know nothing about the art of film. Well, I can assure you that I know as much as the critic you all rely on (without being vain, that is).On to the review:Elektra starts off well, in my opinion. I would have said otherwise, but as far as I recall, the opening is the best part of the film. We're introduced to Elektra as this mysterious warrior who kills her victims in very sensual ways. Her first kill was quite intriguing actually. It makes you want to know more about her.And then we do. Oh God, yes we do. -If you want to make a movie about a 'mysterious' warrior, then you should keep her story mysterious. Even so, if you wish to show parts of her story, don't do so through flashbacks. Even if you choose to use flashbacks, the oldest trick in the book which shows no originality whatsoever, do so without slow-motion. Alas, this film's most hurtful aspect is this. Elektra's flashbacks are tedious to sit through and are incredibly boring. I, for one, never sleep in the cinema. EVER. I kept on trying to stay awake and focus on the film, telling myself that it would get better. I was so terribly wrong.The film gets worse. For approximately 20 minutes we are treated with silence as we see Elektra walk around, do nothing, think and have flashbacks. Those 20 minutes are so useless, I can't even describe how unbelievably bad they are.The film's plot isn't so good either. She is sent to assassinate a father and a daughter, gets to know them, only to find out that the daughter is some special fighter with some special powers and that they are hunted by this unknown society called 'The Hand' and Elektra gets to like these people and tries to save them. For 1 and a half hours. The screenplay never bothers to explain what this society is, how it operates, what these special powers are, where they come from, and why the exist. We are completely left in the dark and the result ends up being sheer stupidity. The story, in very blunt English, is rubbish. It is pointless and never gets anywhere. Even the 'surprise'-ending is absolute rubbish.Not everything was bad though. Jennifer Garner showed off her incredibly fit silhouette and her fighting abilities, as well as her incredible acting ability. She is great. She WAS Elektra. But that didn't save the movie. As for the rest of the acting, there wasn't anything worth noting about. The young girl failed to capture the sympathy needed in order to care what would happen to her character. Whenever she was captured, I honestly hoped that they should have killed her so that the movie would end. I couldn't care less. As for Goran's character: completely useless. He was in the movie for what? Half an hour? And he was the 'love interest'? He did absolutely NOTHING. Completely pointless. Another question that comes to mind was why the film didn't really revolve around Elektra but was really about the young girl. Stupid.. stupid.. stupid...Kudos to the special effects team that worked on the film. All SFX were very well done. The evil characters were truly awesome, with their powers and everything. Too bad they didn't get the chance to properly show off. With characters like those, they could have made a very good film. But.. the action wasn't that good either. Each fight scene lasted for about 2 minutes. And there were approximately a total of six fight scenes in the whole film. You do the math. Not very impressive for an action film, is it? Still, they have their good points. Some of the editing is pretty neat, and the camera work was very good, as well as the choreography. Other than that, everybody's seen better in Spidey 2.The cinematography was quite good, giving off the beautiful colours of the landscapes and locations. The bad thing about this was that the lighting is so poor, it's unbelievable for a feature blockbuster film. In some scenes, it's so bad that you can't even properly see the actors' faces. Finally, to all those who heard the soundtrack (not score), should have a big complaint with the movie. The soundtrack is better than Daredevil's. I was really looking forward to seeing some of my favourite songs in the film. Not a single one. I mean, what's the point of having a soundtrack full of amazing songs, if you're not even gonna use them? And.. what kind of idiot has the rights to an Evanescence song and doesn't include it in the final cut??? Evanescence in a film = Big $$$. Daredevil proved that. I kept on waiting for 'Breathe No More' to start playing in the slower scenes. I was so disappointed.All in all, a very big disappointment. I was expecting so much more. This film had a very interesting premise. Too bad it was all ruined by a crap screenplay and bad action scenes. I was very angry at the end of it, because I wasted 4 pounds on it. I watched and watched in agony that it would get better and have this mind-blowing scene that would make me love it. Nothing. What a failure.Savvas Stavrou's Rating: 4/10 - For cinematography, special effects, Jennifer Garner, and because I feel sorry for it (when I really shouldn't).",Elektra
196,Lunagoddess,"All about ""kimagure""",7,4 December 2006,"The movie was great.However, as a person who is fluent in spoken and written Japanese, when I was watching the movie, I kept thinking, what is ""kimagure""??? I thought that maybe it was some kind of ancient Japanese cultural concept that I didn't know about.So I set out to do a little research. It's funny because I found all these Japanese websites about the movie Elektra, where people are saying stuff like, ""When I was watching the movie I couldn't get past this word ""Kimagure"" it bothered me the whole time I was watching the movie."" ""What the he** is Kimagure??"" ""This word 'kimagure', what is it supposed to be? I can't figure out what they took it from""And there are no Japanese/Chinese characters for it (they wrote it in the phonetic alphabet), because nobody can figure out what it is supposed to be. One Japanese site thought that it came from ""hagakure"" or ""kigakure"", which make no sense either and I am not sure if those are even real words, but if they are, those would mean something like ""shadows of leaves/hidden behind leaves"" or ""in the shadow of trees/hidden behind trees"". There does exist an actual word ""kimagure"", which means ""whimsical, capricious, or fickle"", which has no connotations whatsoever of religion, martial arts, or resurrection. Lol.So basically the Japanese liked the movie but nobody could figure out what ""kimagure"" is supposed to be. :)",Elektra
197,jayneflakes,"Great film, but it seems unloved",9,31 August 2014,"I have watched Daredevil once and that was one time too many, Elektra though I have enjoyed many times and now have on DVD. It saddens me that the criticism of this film is so harsh, even allegedly from it's star. The movie is brooding, often dark and the action is intense. Characters are well conceived and the actors chosen play those roles well. Garner plays a formidable Elektra, but also a human version that has flaws and fears. The human side of her comes to the forefront in this movie and there are not many actresses who could have portrayed such darkness.Lead bad guy Will Yub Lee is as beautiful as he is terrifying and his final fight scene with Elektra is a dignified end to such a powerful character. As characters from the Marvel Universe, there is always going to be the unbelievable side to them, but in this film the story carries them all well.The animation of the bird of prey returning to Tattoo's chest is beautiful and Tythoid's first attack on Elektra is scenically beautiful with the falling black feathers. In truth I like the Hand more than I like Abby and her Father.I like this film, there are a great many things about it that make it excellent and as such I gave it nine out of ten. This quiet little film should be discovered and loved for the classic it is.",Elektra
198,griffinator01,The Good And The Bad,6,16 November 2005,"Jennifer Garner is a mediocre actress at best. Not only that, but her hubby, Ben Affleck, had to wind up in a deleted scene. Everybody else had to carry the rest of the movie for her, from Terrence Stamp (a.k.a. Stick) to Cary-H Tagawa (Roshi, Lord of the Hand).On the upside, it seemed to be faithful to the comic book. I'm an occasional reader of Elektra. I'll give the director credit for sticking to the essence of the story. It also has one of the better night-time fight scenes. You can actually make out the scenery and the action for once. Some movies in the past are terrible at night shots. This movie did a good job at it.Other than that, the movie was fairly decent.

The script is rather thin and the acting is as well. As an action movie, it's a failure cause the action sequences was the worst part of the movie.But what I did like was the way the director really made an effort to make this an visual extravaganza. The sound is great as well. Jennifer Garner luckily succeeds in her portrait of Elektra.

The problem starts after watching 5minutes of ""Action"". You realise even for a sci-fi film there are waaayy too many bits which do not add up.First of all, we see assassins with amazing powers who you start to think ""Hmm, this guy is pretty cool, woulnd't mind watching him for a while, it would be pretty hard for elektra to kill..."" 2 seconds later elektra who is pretty much a hot chick who knows how to summersault and no more skills than a white belt katana jujitsu student, somehow ends up killing them o_O *Slight Spoiler - She stabs an assassin with full force which barely scratches him, he cuts the tree she's standing on, walks away and somehow manages after a 5minute walk to be hit by the not so huge tree as it fell...not thrown...fell.She ""effortlessly"" defeats another guy who can sprout literally 400 or more snakes from he's chest, by taking a leisure walk up to him, and twisting he's neck. You would think one with such amazing powers who knows he's weakness would not use it right in the middle of the field where she can see him -_- After watching the film, i can just about say the only people who made the film authentic were the hand assassins, and the blind old guy who very convincinly owns the screen whenver the camera is on him.",Elektra

I liked the visual aspects of the movie which includes the special effects, settings, and Jennifer Garner. I thought that some of the bad guys were unnecessary.

Yet again they missed the point that these are fantasy films that demand the viewers to suspend their disbelief! Sure, in real life the idea of tattoos coming to life would be ludicrous but here the effects worked well for me. (Maybe Director Rob Bowman borrowed the idea from his self-directed 1997 X-Files episode (""Never Again"") where Scully is confronted by a talking tattoo!) Terrence Stamp as ""Stick"" was well cast and is rapidly becoming a staple ingredient of the Super-hero genre (eg Smallville). Jennifer Garner was born to play Elektra, although her costume was, sadly, not as revealing as it is in the comics! The plot also worked fine for me - to explain why Elektra became the paid assassin she is would have meant yet another Super-hero movie origin sequence which would have no doubt attracted further criticism from the movie intelligentsia!! Has any Bond movie ever bothered to explain his recruitment as a spy? It's taken as given, just as it's a ""given"" that Elektra is an assassin. The only slight criticism I do have is there should have been a sequence directly linking Elektra's death in ""Daredevil"" to her subsequent ""resurrection"" by Stick; otherwise the fact that there is no mention of DD is simply a device to enable ""Elektra"" to be viewed as a stand-alone movie.",Elektra

The villains are pretty cool, Tattoo had to be my favorite. Kirsten Prout does a good job in her role as well. I would have liked see more of Terence Stamp, especially in a good gnarly fight scene. The movie all-around is pretty good and entertaining. I felt it was a good adaptation from the comic.

I don't see many movies where the colors make that much of an impact.I didn't find the dialogue corny or forced. There was only one moment where the audience laughed ""inappropriately,"" and that was at a character's name. The acting was excellent, in my opinion. Jennifer Garner and Goran Visnjic have a natural rapport and Kirsten Prout was very impressive. I hadn't seen her in anything previously. All three of them did a good job of giving these characters some depth and making you care about them, which can sometimes be hard in this type of movie. The villains were, for the most part, subtle and not in your face, as with many movies of this genre.Overall, I liked this movie and recommend it to anyone who likes a good action movie with non-cardboard characters. In addition to the action, there is drama, romance (but not too much), elements of sci-fi and a few laughs.",Elektra
205,martinphipps2,It had one flaw... okay maybe two,9,3 February 2005,"We are supposed to root for Elektra, not because she's Jennifer Garner, not because we already saw her in Daredevil, not because we read any of the comic books, but because the character is inherently likable and/or sympathetic. The Punisher (2004) worked because the main character wasn't introduced as a killing machine: we saw his family die and we saw what it did to him. The same argument could be made for the success of La Femme Nikita. Elektra was introduced as a killing machine and this made her less sympathetic to most movie goers, even though I dug this movie on many levels.The good guys weren't good enough. The bad guys weren't evil enough. We find out too late in the movie who killed Elektra's mother. Besides, maybe she deserved it. Didn't Elektra's victims all deserve to die? You can't have it both ways. If the child of one of Elektra's victims were to fight with her, does that mean that Elektra now deserved to die? Simply stating in the opening title sequence that the Hand is an evil organization doesn't make it so. Was Stick's group really any better? Even Elektra herself seemed unconvinced.I saw this movie already knowing that it was a flop and I went there to find out what went wrong. What I found was, to me, a good movie, so I had to work extra hard to come up with an explanation for why the movie didn't work. This was the best explanation I could come up with. Some people have said ""people don't want female superheroes"" and, yes, perhaps Elektra did suffer from a comparison with Catwoman. This was a better movie, by far, but the fact that the comparison can be made at all is bad news for the makers of this movie.Martin",Elektra

And I was not disappointed, the special effects and action sequences were excellent and the location shots were amazing. The story line was little more than adequate but the action and pace of the movie more than made up for it. Jennifer Garner looked as great as ever. I'm not big on comics and I knew nothing of who or what the Elektra character was about so this movie doesn't just appeal to existing Electra or Daredevil fans (I was really disappointed with Daredevil by the way). I can see why previous posters have said this is a must see for Marvel comics fans! So if your looking for a great action movie don't pass this one up!

The whole ""Treasure"" thing with the young girl was Definitely not shocking. I mean, she sneaks up on Elektra at the very beginning, she breaks into Elektra's place without her even for-seeing it... and her mother was killed... just like Elektra's. How blatentantly obvious. Tattoo was an extremely pathetic character... and the scene where her agent died? If you didn't see that coming I'm very sorry for you. The best part from the movie is Typhoid Mary. Very interesting character. So, aside from Elektra's tight red suit and the laughs you will get from how amazingly cliché this movie is... definitely one of the worst flicks I've seen in a LONG time.

208,sjjsp3,Garner + Alias = Elektra,5,26 February 2005,"I have enjoyed most of the Marvel character films (Hulk aside). So I didn't need much persuading to see Elektra (another selling point being Garner as Elektra) at the cinemas. I entered excited and left rather disappointed.The film sees Jennifer Garner play the assassin Elektra, who has the mystical powers that make her deadly and effective in her field. I don't doubt that she played the role excellently, as i appreciate the work and effort that many actors and actresses have to go through to hone their talents to the roles they are playing. Which is why i was hoping to see something new from Garner. We know that she can do the secretive spy/assassin role. After all, she did so in Alias. Sydnew Bristow- ultra secretive agent wearing numerous guises to accomplish intricate missions.Sure, I knew that Elektra would involve Garner being an assassin. But there was so much scope in the Marvel character that I felt could have been shown to the audience that wasn't. Instead, for me, i felt that Garner, while playing the role quite well, was almost like her Alias role.This really doesn't fall at Garner's door. The writers- who had made the characters quite complex as it was- could have added the extra scope that I felt was shown in successful films like X-Men (especially with the Logan/Wolverine character in X2) and Spiderman (with Peter Parker/ Spiderman)rather than placing Jennifer in a role that, barring the extra bodily work and training she apparently put in, she could do with her eyes closed.The plot was slightly predictable, especially near the end, and though I like Garner as an actress and the outfit they made for her was, well, quite endearing, it's not a film that will challenge for honours. The other actors were not bad but forgettable, except for Abby (Kirsten Prout, I believe) who pulled off the role of the typical stubborn inquisitive teen reasonably well. It'll be interesting to see if she can hone her talents (like a lot of young actors/ actresses) and land big roles of her own later on down the line. If you are not a hardcore fan, wait for it to come on TV.",Elektra
209,bytheseaside,"Should you see it? Well, maybe...",7,30 January 2005,"I expected to come out of that movie with one of three reactions: a) My god! What a freakin' fantastic movie! When can I get it on DVD? b) My god! What was Jannifer Garner thinking, this movie is a piece of first rate trash! or c) My god! This movie is a piece of trash - the only thing worth watching was Jennifer Garner (coz lets face it, she rocks)! I certainly didn't think I'd come out of it feeling ambivalent. I seriously thought that it would either go the way of Spiderman, or the way of DareDevil. So it seemed it did neither. I came out wondering if I should be saying it was good or bad, but not really sure I could say either way...The special effects were fantastic, leaving very little evidence of the fakery. None of it was annoying or false, and there were some excellent scenes including Abby's bracelet - which I thought was awesome.Jennifer did a brilliant job as Elektra, but then that was a given, I don;t think there's a script in the world that she can't breathe her own particular brand of life into. I have yet to see her play a part that I didn't believe in completely.All other parts were played more than adequately, and Abby was very believable as an apparently over-confident teen. All that bluster hiding deeper insecurities. Only hers were a little more frightening than cute boys, pimples and body images.Truthfully, I don't know what made me hum and har, I just know that there was something there that provided a less than perfect picture.Yet, I recommend it.

I've also enjoyed her guest appearances in many other series including Daredevil. When I first saw the trailers for the movie, I thought it was going to a lot of action as fitting the assassin. What we got from this movie is a lot of drama as she soul searches and bonds with the other characters she's hired to kill.I think there was too much drama for sure. I would expect more action when what we got in terms of action was all either shown in the trailers or the FX channel special. When asked if I'd recommend this movie, I recommended to my friends to either wait for it on DVD or cable. It isn't a bad movie if you're into the Marvel comics in general, though I'd say if you're not, it's definitely not the movie for you.I will say that Garner is a great actress and brings the character to life. I also liked the teenage girl prodigy though I'd like to have seen her fight more than she did in the movie.",Elektra

212,batuucan,"Good as a film, but thinking the comic book, well...",6,25 December 2008,"If Elektra was a brand new character, and firstly introduced in this movie, that movie would take at least a 7, I guess. But this movie lacks a lot of storyline compared to the comic book and the fans are very much disappointed.For me, the worst part of these lacks is in Typhoid Mary character. Still, I think she is the best character of this movie is still her; but compared to the original Typhoid Mary, this character is rubbish. The original Typhoid Mary does not look suffered all the time. Contrary, we can see her smiling cunningly and evil. And the original one is one of the best villains comic books had ever seen. In this movie, she is just a bad girl, that's all. A lame character of a lame movie.The original Elektra is not a sad character. In this movie, Elektra's usual mood is sad. Elektra is a skilled, professional assassin. So, she must not be always sad. It is a very big disappointment.The most exciting and active parts are the last scenes and ninja scenes, and they are crap. And the green dust also looks so lame.But I admit, it had very good scenes. Most of all were the Typhoid Mary scenes. Meeting, the kissing, the snakes, the jealousy and all. The movie Typhoid is a very entertaining character, but of course not as good as the original.I give it a six, and I am being generous, cause ignoring the comic book, it is an entertaining film, but including comic book, this movie cannot get near the fantastic comic series.",Elektra
213,googleraide,Not a bad comics book adaptation !!!,3,15 January 2005,"First let me tell you that i'm a fan of Elektra since is early appearance in the comics books Daredevil. As a comics book collector, i'had the chance to follow her appearances in many Marvel publication trought the year and i was expecting this movie adaptation for years.So, yesterday i was at the theater to see Elektra alive...I think that this movie he not a bad interpretation of who and what Elektra is. If you read every comics appearance of Elektra, you'll will see that she's not only a ninja killer, but a human being always confronting is inner demon... So she have soft spot and feelings. Not like the majority, i think that Jennifer Garner interpretation translate that dichotomy very well to the screen and that's great.The biggest mistake of this movie is probably is length. Too short for the great story he have to tell... In the Spider-Man movie, Sam Raimi take the time to let us know who is Spider-Man. Bryan Singer (X-Men 1 and 2), Ang Lee (Hulk) and Tim Burton (Batman, Batman Return) do the same thing. All of them have done probably the greatest comics book movie adaptation 'til now. The problem is that some other movie directors are thinking that a comic book movie is only about costume people, cgi effect and action and nothing else. With this kind of thinking you get crap like Catwoman, Batman Forever, Daredevil or The Punisher and this way you're sure to deceive a comics books fans!!! Elektra is not in the first group, but it's much more better than the last ones.",Elektra
214,craig-193,An atrocity,1,28 January 2005,"Wow.Having nothing to do on a Friday night, myself and my girlfriend decided to go along to the cinema and see a movie. There was nothing much on, of course, I sure didn't want to see ""Alexander"", and the choice eventually came down to ""Elektra"" or ""Meet The Fockers"". Perhaps foolishly, I agreed with my girlfriend that ""Elektra"" might provide us with some better entertainment. That was my first big mistake.Sitting in the cinema, just as the movie began, a baby in the front row began crying. I thought to myself ""What sort of person takes a baby to a movie?"", but I realise now that what the baby did was very smart, because he or she got themselves out of having to see this turkey. Not following the baby out was my second big mistake.It's hard to pinpoint an exact reason why this movie fails dismally. It could be the fact that Jennifer Garner, who is hardly a spectacular actor to begin with, is completely out of her depth here. It might have something to do with the fact that Kristen Prout's character is so unlikeable that I was hoping that somebody would stab her in the face. It might be something to do with the fact that the baddies are completely undeveloped as characters, and are little more than mobile weapon-carrying props. It could be to do with the fact that a lot of the action in the film is completely nonsensical, such as Elektra's OCD. How is this relevant to the film, or the story? It isn't! I shouldn't have to read several years with of comics to be able to make sense of what is going on on the screen. However, I think that the reason that this movie really stinks is just that almost everything about it is mediocre at best, like the cast and crew were on autopilot when it was being made.The sole saving grace in this film is Colin Cunningham, who plays McCabe, who gets off to a slow start, but nonetheless manages to deliver the most convincing acting here. Other than that though, it's very slim pickings. Bad acting, bad plot, bad special effects... bad everything. The director and writer of this film should be taken out the back and beaten within an inch of their lives, for releasing this shocker onto the world.PS. My girlfriend hated it too.",Elektra
215,theduece,Why do they make these films?,5,14 January 2005,"Having just recently seen this movie I feel the need to rant and definitely not rave about it.This is movie is nothing spectacular and you know something is wrong with this country when 64 gave this stupid thing a 10. I understand 10 doesn't mean it was the greatest film ever but excellence is what is should have...this movie doesn't.We catch up with Elektra apparently a few years after Daredevil has ended (which in my opinion was fairly good movie, but once again not spectacular). Elektra is an assassin for hire and gets a job to kill Mark (Goran) and his early-teenage daughter. But she can't do it and this leads us on a semi-live semi-CGI adventure. She dispatches each of the members of ""The Hand"" (The ""evil-doers"" trying to stop her and the people she had to kill but never did), quite quickly. Now I really hate the totally Hollywood style flicks, the ones where their purpose is to use CGi and action to make the film seem better (Day After Tomorrow). But this is film that needed it, you already expect it to be one and then it doesn't even deliver on that level. Stupid cliché ending, action that doesn't deliver and it falls short on the acting. This needed to be much longer with longer action and more back story.Toally average...if even that 5.5/10 (.5 for Jennifer Garner b/c she is so damned hot)",Elektra

Was it just me, or did Stone die way too quickly? And why was McCabe in the movie at all? Oh, and Abby is quite possibly the most annoying character I've ever seen in a movie. The only members of the cast I found even remotely good were Will Yun Lee and Jennifer Garner.One thing I should say is that the visual effects were great, one of few positive things about the movie and also one of few things that keep me from rating this movie a 1.The only good scene is the final battle between Kirigi and Elektra, also one of few things keeping me from giving this a 1.Final Score--3/10",Elektra

My cousins were kinda bored from it, but they still liked it. I saw the trailers (on TV and on computer) and I thought it looked cool, and a little scary. The only downer part in the movie was the part where that bad chick kissed Elektra, or whatever she was doing. That part was a little weird, I have to admit that. But besides that, it was great movie! I probably won't see it again until it comes out on DVD, but oh well. I recommend this to anybody, especially the Jennifer Garner fans. By the way, I give her acting an A+!! Awesome!!

Jennifer Garner is gorgeous and the villains were wonderful. Elektra is an anti-hero (a person who kills people, not saves them; but soon chooses a better path), so expect a lot of violence and action. The refreshing thing is that there is real dialog and real depth also in this surprising film. I recommend this movie to anyone who has got an imagination, a taste in movies, an action movie lover or a Marvel fan. Bottom line - go see this because you will not be disappointed. It is a fun action movie with a good story.Finally, a movie that was worth the admission fee.

I eagerly awaited ELEKTRA, mainly because of Jennifer Garner and being a huge fan of her TV show, Alias. Elektra not only lived up to my expectations, it surpassed them mainly because of the great action and, of course, phenomenal acting by the great Jennifer Garner.The movie has a X-MEN appeal to it, with bad guys doing supernatural things. Ranging from Tattoo, a villain with animal tattoos covering his body that come to life when he beckons them, to Typhoid Mary, an evil villainess who plants a deadly kiss upon her prey, the villains surely are a substantial match for Elektra.It follows an interesting plot of Elektra Natachios, assassin extraordinaire, finding her own identity through helping others. A father and daughter pair, her next targets, render Elektra to evoke her maternal instincts and instead of carrying out her orders, she opts to protect the pair whilst going against her instincts and evil counterparts.The new young actress playing the daughter pair, Kirsten Prout, gives an honest, action packed performance. The villains also emit a spine chilling performance that makes you truly wonder whether this movie will end with Good conquering Evil or vice versa. Jennifer Garner gives an EXTREME performance through her dedication to each and every action sequence that are beyond awesome! Everyone should see this movie if they want be entertained and can suspend reality for a brief 97 minutes.

I especially liked the work-out montage - it doesn't seem very often that the practical side of being a superhero is shown in a movie. I really liked the teenager. I think her acting was great for the role. I enjoyed all the fight scenes, but on almost all of them it seemed like something could have been just a little bit better. I was kind of disappointed that I was more attracted to the supervillian than the love interest (but then maybe that says more about me than the movie). About the end: I felt like they really cheesed-out. I didn't feel like any of the loose-ends they had up to that point needed to be tied up. They obviously wanted to leave it open for a sequel, but they really could have been more subtle - really, everybody knows that if the movie made any money, they'll make a sequel.

I expected nothing, especially after the film got slashed by lots of people. But still I always want to see it for myself before judging something. And I was pleasantly surprised. The movie was entertaining and while certainly not a masterpiece, it's absolutely worth watching. And that's coming from a comic book reader who wants to see an adaptation as faithful as possible but who almost never really gets that. Some things at that I mind and some things I can live with.

I have to give some credit where it's due and add my opinion that the CG effects aren't as bad as the other reviews make them out to be. There's just not enough depth or choreography to the fights and the 'bad guys' are extremely poorly developed throughout the story, which was a shame.I can't compare this movie to either Catwoman or Daredevil on suckiness- steered clear of both of these.

Well, here - this is the first time I have ever come home from a movie and said ""I have to get on IMDb and write a review of this NOW. It is my civic duty."" Such is the badness of this flick. *begin digression* But let me just state one thing before I start. I'm not some Harvard-art-major-film-noir-weenie (in fact, I went to the college at the other end of Mass. Ave in Cambridge, the one where the actual smart people without rich daddies and trust funds go, which should put me squarely in the nerd-who-would-obsessively-love-comic-book-films census group, and still I hated this film...). My viewing preference is for the highbrow cinematic oeuvre that includes the Die Hards, Bond flicks, Clerks, and The Grail. I wish the Titanic had never sunk, not so much for the lives lost, but so we wouldn't have been subjected to that dung-heap of a film. And the single and only reason I will watch a snooty French art film is if there is a young and frequently disrobed Emmanuelle Beart in it. I even gave Maximum Overdrive one of its precious few 10s here on IMDb, for God's sake. So I'm as shallow as they come, therefore I'm not criticizing this film because I'm looking for some standard of cinematic excellence - it's because Elektra stinks like a three-week-old dead goat. *end digression*OK, there's so much badness here that I have to try to categorize it. Here goes:MS. GARNER: One of the compelling reasons a male would want to see this flick is to see lots of hot JGar (I have no idea why my wife wanted to). I think that between this and ""Finding Nemo"", the latter was the sexier film. You know the red outfit she's advertised wearing in every freaking ad you see? You see her in it TWICE - once at the beginning, once at the end. Bummer. In the rest, she basically looks like what Morrissey would look like if he were a female - lots of pouting and black clothes. Which brings me to the incredible range of expression JGar shows in her acting - ranging from ""pouting"" all the way to ""pouting and crying"". Oh my God, you'd think she was being forced to date Ben Affleck or something horrible like that. Um, wait...THE BAD GUYS/GAL: They show about the same range of expression and acting ability that you'd expect from a slightly overripe grapefruit. At least next to JGar's performance, it doesn't stand out too badly. One guy's role is to stand there and be huge, another's is to stand there and have stuff come out of him, and the woman's role is to stand there and breathe on and/or kiss people. They manage to pull these incredible feats off. The main bad guy has the most difficult role of all - he has to SIMULTANEOUSLY a) appear angry and b) appear Asian. He does a fine job at this. I think there was a fifth bad guy/gal, but my brain is starting to block parts of this movie out in self-defense.PLOT TWISTS! This movie has about as many surprises as a speech at the Democratic National Convention. Let's just put it this way - my wife, who has only been in the U.S. for half a year and speaks only a small amount of English - whispered this to me when the girl first appears in JG's pad, and I swear to God I am not making this up: ""She go to house to kill girl. And father too."" And this is BEFORE THE FATHER HAS EVEN APPEARED ON THE SCREEN. Now my wife isn't stupid, but she isn't being courted by Mensa for her gifts, either, and she's had zero exposure to Daredevil or the comic book genre. And she figured this out in .00015 seconds with no prodding and no prior information. Such is the blatant obviousness of this film. RARELY-BEFORE-SEEN STUPIDITY! OK, so there's this big dude in the film.

238,Selebii,Succeeds less than it fails sadly...,4,16 June 2005,"Well I'll confess I was 17 when this movie first came out and was gearing up to see Jennifer Garner in the hot red outfit. I did however also expect to see a fun beat em' up in the vein of Daredevil but more darker than the former. I wanted to see this ruthless assassin of Marvel myth. What I got was something made for a cash on Garner's looks. You can all read a number of synopsis' here so I won't tell the story. So I'll break down the good, bad, and ugly.The Good: Garner is fantastic as a tortured soul who's not quite sure why she's still alive, and hates her job. Garner embodies the character very well and she is very fun to watch. Some of the fight scenes are very nicely done and Garner lights up the screen with her sais. Terrence Stamp is an interesting choice for Stick. Stick was Daredevil's mentor not Elektra's making this an almost odd fit. Stamp does well and is great. As are Hand. Very interesting. The visuals are also nice.The Bad: The above is hampered by a horrendous script which makes no sense. We learn Elektra has OCD and chants numbers with the child fighting prodigy while running away from an explosion. The fight scenes are too short.The Ugly: Elektra also suffers because of the annoying added character of the child prodigy fighter. This movie was good up until this kid's true nature was revealed. She has a set of magic Mardi Gras beads that he fights crime with as well. Apparently Elektra and this girl's father also have some sort of love story that consists of two kisses. There is no character development or really any explanation as to why the two organizations started fighting in the first place. The climax is especially disappointing as the main villain Kirgi wraps Elektra up in sheets, chases her outside, beats up on her, then gets stabbed in a fluke. All the other villains are easily disposed of as well.Bottom Line: Garner's performance can't save a movie hurt by a bad script and even worse editing.Avoid this one at all costs.",Elektra
239,StarMatt85,"""Awful"" isn't quite bad enough",2,14 January 2005,"This movie is one of the few where you expect a complete and utter lack of anything redeeming, and the actors/director/screenwriters/special effects guy actually manage to fail at a level you hadn't previously imagined possible. The plot is almost nonexistent, attempts at subplots are simply comical, the CGI looks like it was done in a Freshman Graphics course( Bedsheets! They animate CGI BEDSHEETS!), the dialogue was forced and almost kitschy, and the actors deliver it as though studio heads are standing behind the camera pointing to their signed contracts. Avoid this one at all costs unless the only other option is ""Catwoman"".",Elektra
240,fj_cruz1,Above average film,5,14 January 2005,"Watched this last night here in Sydney Australia, and what can i say? It's an alright movie, but the TV commercials makes it look as if there's gonna be A lot of action and fighting, when there really isn't much. Personally, Natassia Malthe looked so much better than Jennifer Garner, plus she actually looked more like the Elektra character from the comics. The directing was also alright. Some scenes just seemed dead, others just to fill up time, though funnily it seemed to go by quickly. The final fight just came like that. I was there thinking ""dont tell me the climax is coming already"", did the climax fight deliver? No, not really, but was still amusing to watch though. Overall this is an above average film except from those minor issues i addressed, and is a better movie than Catwoman, but, what isn't? 6/10",Elektra
241,willimen-geo,"Disappointing, predictable, hilarious.",3,23 July 2005,"I honestly do not know what kind of audience the director had in mind when filming this movie. The movie is a total disappointment. Not even a single scene of this movie is original. The whole movie from the very beginning to the very end is totally predictable. The viewer is never (even a little) surprised or taken aback by the turn of events. It has all the stereotypical dialogue, development and ending.Garner is too ""little"" for the part since whenever she tries to appear serious, solemn or dramatic she instead is ludicrous. Terence Stamp does his best to give a decent performance (and in part he succeeds), but the whole ""fake"" atmosphere of the movie spoils his efforts.Being a fan of Marvel comics in my teenage years I try to follow all the latest developments on comics transfered to the big screen and I do not mind saying that I keep a rather positive attitude towards any such endeavour since I enjoy both these forms of art. Thus, I am not strict at judging comic book transfers to film. Not being strict, I found Elektra a disappointment. It is by far the worst effort of this kind.",Elektra

Jenifer Garner was at her best, and the moves and weapons and style of the movie and the performance was to its best I would personally have recommend it to any person, I watched it 2 times in 4 days.Something about it that just got me into it, and had me mesmerized to the point where I watched it over and over again.

243,coughingdragon,Bland adaptation of a fascinating character,2,27 January 2006,"Frank Miller's Elektra is a fascinating character, but all that makes her interesting is sadly missing from this movie. In the comics, Elektra is an exotic assassin who only slightly removed morally from the people she is paid to kill. In this movie, she is still an assassin, but a very bland one. Jennifer Garner lacks the exotic quality necessary to bring the character alive bringing more of a girl next door quality that makes her less than convincing as an assassin. The script does her no favors by giving us a very conventional story of revenge and protecting a young girl that doesn't allow for the moral ambiguities that would have given this movie a chance at being interesting.The Elektra presented here is not alone in being bland as pretty much everything in this movie is completely uninvolving. None of the characters here escapes being two dimensional with both the writing and the acting to blame. The plot of the movie is at its heart very basic with a couple of weird elements thrown in that don't work. The look and feel of the movie is that of a straight to video offering not a major motion picture, so it is tough to figure where the budget was spent on this movie.Somewhere there is a great film to be made out of the Elektra character, but this sure isn't it. I hope that in the future someone else will be given the chance to make that film.",Elektra
244,Schizoid_DTRASH,Garbage,1,27 January 2005,"This movie was just horrible. Wooden acting from Garner, who in this movie looks a lot like a guy. My friend was like ""Who is that ugggly guy"" and I'm like ""Hey that is actually the star of the movie, this chick Elektra who's supposed to be sexy"" and she laughed for an hour after that. Totally contrived love story, with of course a stupid kid to act as a barrier to the plot. This is the worst comic book movies get, I saw Catwoman and I can't say much for it but I could say that it's better than this one. What a waste of my 5 dollars, I knew it would be bad going into it and it was bad walking out of it.

245,dbruhn1,Another solid addition to the Marvel movie library,9,17 January 2005,"I am a fan of movies based on characters from comics. Elektra is a good movie, even if it does not reach the level of the Spiderman or the X-Men movies. (Apparently, those movies are the gage by which all live-action comic movies will be judged.) As with most good movies, the story and the characters are the strong points of the film. The special effects and action sequences are well done; however, they are toned down a bit to allow Elektra (who is human) to be the featured element of the movie. Since director Rob Bowman may be at the helm of the X-Men series in the future, it was good to see he knows how to bring a comic character to the big screen in a non-comedic manner.There is no getting around the fact that this is a girl power film that many guys will enjoy.

This is, without a doubt, the most pitiful, pathetic excuse for a pile of garbage that I have ever seen in my entire life.Not only does this movie not any sense the plot is stupid and acting is horrible. What does ""You're counting your steps"" mean. Or why can she fly up to people real fast but she couldn't in Daredevil. I think this movie should be put in a crap pile and be burned because they could have done a trillion times better with the plot instead they thought they could put in bad guys that would appeal to three year olds. Ohhhhhhhh, they have a guy who's tattoo's turn into what they really are. Ohhhhhhhh, a girl with stinky breath (i seriously busted out laughing after that one). And what is with the stupid green gas that escapes from them after they die. Do they feel the need to fart before they die, come on all the DVD's should be put on a rocket, sent up to space and blown up.By the end of the film, I was totally convinced that Satan himself had directed this movie for the sole purpose of tormenting any poor soul who made the horrible mistake of watching it.

247,CrowTurtle,Elektra - A Look Inside the Soul of a Woman - And Finding Her True Reflection,10,14 May 2006,"Though 'Elektra' has enough action in it, this movie is almost a spiritual exercise or investigation. In the movie the character McCabe tells Elektra that she might want to ""reflect a bit"". And that is exactly what this movie, Elektra, is about. Self-reflection in coming to know her real heart. Throughout the film there are images of reflection - a glass in the beginning - a mirror at the end - water/a lake in the middle - and the character herself, Abby Miller.And this brings us to the presence of grace in Elektra's life - the matter of ""Christmas"" and Christmas dinner in the movie. And 'who' invites her.Abby Miller (13 years old - who is also in the movie an 'image' of 'Elektra') invites Elektra to dinner that evening with her dad - on the day of Christmas. Abby has to remind Elektra what day it is - standing side by side on the shore of a beautiful lake. The invitation itself carries with it an invitation to the mystery of grace - it is a gift for Elektra to see a truth that has been missing in her life since childhood.Upon self-examination, introspection and this mystery of grace in her life (and her teacher - the character ""Stick"" played wonderfully by Terence Stamp) Elektra wakes up to her true nature and heart - her true mind and sanity/peace. This is signified by the sounds of nature/birdsong or calls heard at times in the background throughout the movie.So, compared to the other big comic book movies, 'Elektra' is a quiet and human story, not mostly based on action but more on mood and spirit. Rob Bowman, the director, does a wonderful job here, looking into the human heart and finding the light in so much darkness.This is a very good movie - if you have the patience for it. 'Elektra' is a quiet revelation of the human heart and spirit. And it has its fun aspect as well - it will leave you with a smile.A very cool and interesting movie! Peace out & cheers! -CrowTurtle",Elektra
248,RenX99,not the Electra I know...,4,17 January 2005,"Perhaps I'm out of date or just don't know what Electra is like in current publications... But the Electra that I read was far more manipulative and always seems to have a plan. She usually used others to do her dirty work and more often than not some sort of double cross was involved. Just when you think you have it all figured out she pull the wool over your eyes and gets her way.This movie was fairly weak on the dialog, the acting wasn't particularly convincing, and the action was spotty. I was really looking for something more along the lines of Frank Miller's book ""Electra Assassin."" Which is much darker than anything in this movie.Special effect where cool, action was interesting at times, but more often than not the story and plot was slow or illogical. Tha Hand was not menacing enough, and Electra was not..... bitchy enough. She's the girl you love to hate... but in this story, I just didn't care either way.",Elektra
249,thormich,The worst comic-book adaptation (so far),2,9 August 2005,"What is wrong with the people who make this comic-book adaptations. How could this piece of garbage pass through the script reading department of a major studio (in this case Fox). Jennifer Garner walks through the sets trying to look sullen and angry but fails miserably. She looks nice in her red outfit but the story is so ludicrous that you totally lose interest after 15 minutes. Elektra (Jennifer Garner) is an assassin who gets an assignment to kill a father and her daughter. Suddenly she changes her mind and decides to try and protect them from some bad guys that appears out of the blue. The bad guys in this case is a bunch of clowns from an organization called ""The Hand"" (I know,it's baad). It turns out that the daughter has some kind of superpowers herself and ""The Hand"" wants her (don't know why). By then I wanted to rip the disc out of the DVD-player and burn it, but it was a rental so I constrained myself. Elektra is a spin off of the movie Daredevil which leads us to a hilarious deleted scene on the DVD. It shows Matt Murdock (Daredevil) coming to Elektra in a dream. The scene with the worst actor alive Ben Affleck (who plays Daredevil) was thankfully removed from the movie. 2 out of 10.",Elektra
250,chris-743,Really well done.,10,22 January 2005,"People should go and see this movie irrespective of the terrible reviews it is getting. I just don't think it deserves them at all. There are some really well choreographed sequences and it has quite a bit of feeling and emotion put into the way the characters are portrayed. I would say that it isn't for kids - we had a row of 10 of them behind us and all they did was talk. So it's obviously too slow for them. It's a very well constructed film and Jen Garner is absolutely magic in the lead. The enemy assassins are maybe slightly less well thought out but they aren't so bad. I just feel that this movie is getting a hard time for no good reason. So, DO NOT believe the terrible press; go and see it and make up your own mind.",Elektra
251,gallows-humor,A Film with an Identity Crisis,6,12 June 2006,"Elektra is not a bad movie, and I can't say that I didn't enjoy the film on at least some levels. On the contrary, I identified with the main character's redemption story arc, and understood how she was motivated to redeem herself through her relationship with Abbey. However, the film itself detracts from that storyline in myriad ways, not the least of which are a poorly conceived plot, woefully inadequate action sequences and a poor screenplay.First, problems with the plot. After Daredevil, we all know that Elektra has some problems, not the least of which is being dead. Her father has been murdered, she's been separated from the love of her life, and (we are given to assume by the writers of this movie) she has withdrawn from everything she's ever known. None of these concepts are far-fetched, given the audiences' presumed familiarity with the Daredevil movie. However, what is not reasonable to assume is that the audience will understand her transformation into a cold-blooded assassin.In Daredevil, Elektra is a tempestuous character to be sure, but nothing hints that she is a cold-blooded killer. On the contrary, she is a vivacious and vibrant person, fiercely protective of her father, and so motivated by her emotions that she crawls with her dying breaths to say good-bye to the love of her life. So, it begs the question: how did she become an amoral, isolated, emotionally dead assassin? We don't really get an answer. Okay, fine, we get a few flashbacks, including a particularly touching sequence where Stick shows her the door because she doesn't ""know the Way."" But how did she go from a passionate person consumed with anger and grief to an amoral killer? Why become an assassin instead of hunting down Kingpin and Bullseye to seek revenge? Why did losing her father convince her that she is not a good person, and is only fit to kill others for hire? Why not seek out Daredevil and join him in fighting crime? These are all natural questions, and we never get a satisfying answer to them.I know that part of the plot was determined by the history of the comic book character, who was a cold-blooded killer. For the record, I'm not sure I agree that the movie adaptation should be dictated by the comic books, since comic book fans alone aren't going to make your movie succeed. But, assuming it should be, why not tell that story, instead of giving it to us in half-realized flashbacks and corny segments of dialogue? A fully realized, unapologetic female anti-hero might sell at the box office, and then they could tell the story of her redemption in Daredevil 2 (assuming it ever gets made given the franchise's history).Second, problems with the action sequences. If you view any of the Extended DVD's bonus features, you learn that this film was shot in an amazingly short span of time (62 days for principal photography) due to time constraints imposed by Jennifer Garner's Alias commitments. I don't blame Mrs. Affleck for honoring her contractual obligations, but I do blame the director and writers for not using what little time they did have more effectively. Elektra's showdown with Kirigi should have been the most visually arresting sequence of the film. It should have shown two consummate martial artists locked in a fierce, closely matched battle to the death. At the very least, it should have allowed us to actually *see* the combatants in action, to appreciate the intensity and artistry of the match. What did we get? We got dancing sheets, a visually ambiguous succession of 1-2 second cuts, and a completely anti-climactic resolution which utterly fails to demonstrate that Elektra is one of the premiere martial artists in the world. I understand they had time constraints, but if that was the case, why spend so much time rehearsing and filming Elektra's 5-on-1 at Stick's dojo? Why have Abbey fight at all? Why waste time showing Stick's ninjas dropping from the trees? Maybe there was simply no way to address the action sequences in a satisfactory fashion given their time constraints, but I have my doubts as to that.Finally, problems with the script. Some of the writing works, but a good deal of it falls flat, or worse yet does a disservice to the character speaking. No less than 4 times in the film, faced with a seemingly insurmountable obstacle or moral quandary, all Elektra can do is utter 1 or 2 syllable cuss words: sh*t, g*d d*mm*t, sh*t and sh*t, to be precise. That's all the screen writers can give her, whether she's waking up to nightmares, faced with being hunted by the Hand, learning that Kirigi himself is after Abbey, or letting her handler take the fall because she decided to drag him into a fight he didn't choose? Give me a break.My suspicion is that the dialogue often fails for the same reason the overall storyline suffers: because the writers have created situations that simply are not believable given the audiences' present knowledge. What is Elektra's history with the Hand? Why does she know that Kirigi is such a bad guy to have after you? Why does her handler volunteer to take the fall for a paid killer and two people she was supposed to kill to make him $200,000? And what the h*ll does OCD have to do with ANYTHING in this story?On the whole, the film left me more frustrated than disappointed. This could have been a good movie. Jennifer Garner is a fine actress, and the concept behind Elektra (a ruthless female assassin) could have served as the basis for some interesting story-telling. But, somewhere between making an interesting movie and creating a faithful reproduction of a comic book, somewhere between 62 days and sufficient time to make an action film, and somewhere between a competent action director and the X-files, this movie got lost.",Elektra
252,coltonw,How does this have good ratings?,1,1 May 2006,"I would consider this one of the worst, if not THE worst movie I have ever seen. Lucky for me, there are plenty of opportunities to laugh at how bad the movie is. The character is barely explained beyond the fact that she is a martial arts prodigy who was orphaned after some crazy assassin killed her parents. Also, the villains are lead by a council of evil Asian guys, which are completely unexplained and therefore hilarious. There is also a guy who can turn his tattoos into animals, that are for some reason rocket powered. The best is that a whole team of about 30 ninjas attacks Elektra at a mansion and they all jump through one window over the stove where Elektra is waiting to blow them up. You would think one of those 30 NINJAS would realize that jumping through the one window above the stove is not a good entry. All the villains die anti-climatically in a cloud of smoke. The invincible guy dies by a tree falling slowly onto him. The tattoo guy dies when Elektra finds him and just stabs him while he is in some sort of trance. The final bad guy runs into her knife, going super-speed with apparently no super reflexes.",Elektra
253,DaveCurtis,Better than many say!,5,3 June 2005,"As a fan of comic books and of the recent Marvel comic book adaptations I came to Elektra open-minded. One of the few who enjoyed her first outing in Daredevil I was expecting more of the same kick-ass action. I was wrong. Elektra is a much calmer, spiritual and dream-like experience. Having been killed at the end of Daredevil, Elektra is resurrected and becomes a detached assassin, feared by many. Her 'life' changes when she starts to care for a man and his daughter who she was told to kill. As she protects them from her former gang, The Hand, she discovers secrets from her past. Gone is the constant rock soundtrack of Daredevil, which is replaced by a haunting orchestral score. The city environments, for the most part, are replaced by beautifully shot location work on an island, in forests and mansions. Jennifer Garner's performance is fine; the story requires both character and actress to be very efficient, without putting in too much energy. The character is less emotional and glamorous than in Daredevil. Some of the lower villains are more memorable than the main villain, whose name you should be able to recall but just can't. This is by far the most mystical of all of Marvel's films, unlike previous films where scientific explanations are given for powers; the henchmen here have unexplained weapons such as deadly kisses, tattoos that come to life and incredible super strength. The film may not be anywhere near as exciting as the Spider-Man or X-Men franchises, some parts do meander and there are plot holes but it is definitely a more engrossing film then Marvel's last film Blade: Trinity. ***",Elektra
254,TKuusisto,"Lacking edge, this beauty won't be remembered",4,20 August 2005,"A fairly watchable movie, even with Jennifer Garner, who can just about hold her own as the prime female assassin in the Marvel universe. Acting, though, is not the problem, while the screenplay is. Some of the dialogue makes Elektra seem too human and not the super she has appeared as in the comic books.Her life ended when she was killed, from then on she is a hanger-on in reality, struggling with her instincts and the calling of her heart. What made her interesting was the ambiguity of her morals. In this movie this aspect has been all but lost, making the yarn pretty standard Hollywood fare. She should be more of a tragic hero, much like Daredevil, who was sorely missed. With better writing it would be a treat indeed if they would share a film again.Directing is pretty and clean, with some nice visuals accompanied by a pair of eye-catching walks away from the camera by Ms. Garner. Terence Stamp shines as the venerable Stick, but the sidekicks of Kirigi were disappointing. The ""scene with the black leaves"" aside, Typhoid was a complete loss without the magnificent carrot top, pink jacket and stockings; what she was left here with were a low cut is-it-a-belt-or-a-skirt and a bad case of halitosis. A point worth making is also the costuming, which is colourful but cheap, highlighting the importance of the field in film-making.The movie scores points with the stunning fight scenes. Elegantly executed, beautiful dances with enough creativity to put the Matrix sequels to shame, the fights were the bread and butter for the movie. CGI was used tastefully, which is sadly rare these days.All in all, any fans of the leading lady will be delighted to see that she can do more than put on the puppy face like in Alias. Reign of Fire and this movie have me convinced enough to spend another two hours with the next Rob Bowman picture. Hope he gets some better material next time.",Elektra

These reviews are very unfounded and I find it hard to believe the reviewers even watched it. This movie, unlike recent annoying bad films such as Blade Trinity, spent time to develop a script and its characters. I enjoyed every character, but would have liked to know more about Stick. Elektra was played well by Jennifer Garner and she's impressive as the super hero. The action was great and the story was innovative.

256,lodgej,Only hardcore fans of Garner should bother,3,23 August 2005,"After Daredevil I was interested to seeing the character development of Elektra in her own movie. To say I was disappointed, was an understatement. Too much is left for assumption, even as an old comic book fan, I found it confusing; this film obviously relies on you knowing the Frank Miller books. With the current trend for comic adaptations and the efforts they make to retell even the most well known and loved stories (Spiderman, Hulk), the lack of effort to explain who how and what, was lazy and left you scratching your head.The action pieces are fairly entertaining and Jennifer Garner looks powerful and credible, but the result is that she is the only real reason to want to watch this film.

257,rossatdi,"Really not very good, see something else",2,23 January 2005,"Now first off I would just like to say i haven't read the comics, i'm judging it purely on being a film.Its kinda underwhelming. Firstly the plot feels clichéd and rather silly. The directing is occasionally good but the action scenes lacked any real punch. To complement this director likes panning dialogue scenes a little too much. Not only that but the dialogue is pi*s-poor but thats expected from most comic book translations (i'm not criticising comics i'm just saying that they rarely have good dialogue in film conversions).The characters push the boundaries of stupidity. One character, McCabe, feels introduced for the sole purpose of his extermination. For some reason when the agents of 'the hand' (the bad guys, apparently) are killed they explode in green smoke. This might be explained in the comic books but here it looks stupid and isn't explained.Also whats with a martial art that can bring back the dead? The action set pieces were painfully boring. Even the final fight seemed fairly unimpressive. The tattoo guy who initially looked kind of cool became a joke when he fired screaming dog rockets at his targets.One last criticism has to fall on Jennifer Garner and the Elektra outfit design. She can't really act (as shown when dismissed from Stick's school and her attempt to look sad) and the outfit while very revealing was actually really rather ugly.At the end of the day this film lacked the basics of a good film, namely plot, writing, directing and acting.

Another thing was that some of the deaths were really quick but other than that it's great. You do not need to see Daredevil to enjoy it. The only thing it has to do with Daredevil is the character of Elektra. There are no cameos of Kingpin, Matt Murdock,Bullseye or any other character. In my opinion it is much better than Daredevil.

There were a number of problems though.First off, the connection to the Daredevil movie that ""wasn't"". By that, you see Elektra being brought back from death by Stick. Yet, while her memories seem more or less intact from her previous life she makes no lamentations over Matt Murdock. A man she cares for a ton (ref: the braille cartouche at the end of Daredevil) I could go on all day really with one after another of minor ""grumbles"". Because honestly? That's all I have really with this movie is minor grumbles. If you're a fan of the comic book or Jennifer Garner? Go see this movie. Don't ""expect"" anything. Just enjoy it.

Daredevil was ""forced"" down to ~90 mins. Methinks the same is true of Elektra unfortunately. The short duration is probably this movies biggest downfall. 7 of 10 is a fair rendering in my book.

262,henry-williams-1,"Aah, at last it's starting to get interesti... oh its finished",4,28 January 2005,"Okay, this should have been so much more fun than it was.In it's favour the film has some interesting visuals, and yes, the emotional development of the characters is well handled, but then might I suggest that if we wanted to see an emotional family drama we'd go and watch Little Women, rather than something which was advertised as an ACTION FILM! You know all the cool looking fight excerpts in the trailer? Want more when you go to see the film? well that's your lot. They're not showing highlights, they're showing you the whole thing. The unfortunate effect of all this standing around looking brooding when there's no pay off means that the film just feels more and more ponderous, sinking under the weight of it's own pretension.When the film finally gets going with a swordfight over an hour and a quarter in, it suddenly becomes apparent just how bad the fight choreography is. In the wake of films like Crouching Tiger, the recent Thousand Daggers, and even The Last Samurai a pretty high standard has been set. Elektra falls lamentably short. Having said that responsibility must be shared by the cameraman, who must have drunk too much coffee because he CAN'T STAY STILL! Finally, you cannot create a psychologically realistic film when the central character's name is Elektra Nachios. It's like getting Arnie to do Brecht, it's not gonna work. This film feels like it has been focus grouped to death. It lacks any kind of spark or originality, and to be brutally honest is sufficiently cynical that the makers are deserving of nothing but contempt.",Elektra
263,debox-1,Elektra Electrifies!,8,18 January 2005,"Excellent action film despite my aversion for superhero chick flicks. Jennifer Garner as the title character brings a lot to the role. Her ability to switch between a combat-mode warrior and emotionally-damaged woman is superb. The rest of the other characters except for actress Kirsten Prout (Abby Miller) are semi-formed as if they were put in just so Elektra has someone to interact with or beat up. Ms. Prout's performance was excellent in her portrayal of the novice-prodigy that Elektra tries to protect. I expect to see even greater things from this young lady in the future. The fight scenes were a appropriate blend of real photography and FX. The script was good too as it forced Elektra to face increasingly difficult situations while still trying to confront her own inner demons. Gave this an ""8"" and I hope there is a sequel with Garner and Prout!",Elektra

Elektra follows the adventures of Elektra after her untimely demise is DareDevil, She is a gun for hire who starts to get a sense of morality when she is contracted to kill 2 people she has befriended, the movie is all about her finding a reason for living and kicking some ass on the side.After the major disappointment of Daredevil i was not expecting much from this, and that is what i got. The movie looked nice the acting was good but it was just all together dull nothing much happened at the start and it pretty much finished the same way. Not much more can be said about this movie because it is nothing like it was advertised it seems that its main target audience is 14 to 25 males who like to see Ms Garner taking off and putting on different tops, but if that's what you want you will have a ball otherwise don't bother.4 out of 10 save your money and go see the incredibles for the 4th or 5th time",Elektra

Jennifer Garner has proved herself as a good actor with physical presence on the small scene. She also did a fair job in Daredevil. Rob Bowman has completed some okay pictures too. But Elektra simply doesn't add up to anything worth seeing. The script is dull and the character development is all but non-existent, there are attempts here and there but nothing substantial. Okay, so this is a special effects, action movie but surely some substance can be squeezed in. I found it hard to pick a side, I couldn't empathise with the main character and found myself longing for the action scenes, which - to be truthful - were way below par. There wasn't a single redeeming aspect of this movie. I hope MARVEL do better on their next attempt.3/10.",Elektra

267,Joel1991,what i think,6,24 May 2005,i wasn't sure if i enjoyed this movie but it did have fascinating scenes . i feel that it was not the best marvel movie to this date (far from it!) however a sequel would be nice and hopefully this time a bit more to do with daredevil as that is one of my favourite flicks to this very date i found the storyline a bit tacky but appriate for this particular kind of movie. the Japanese culture they captured in this movie is wonderful and creates and warm secure feeling throughout the movie my favourite scene is when she is training as a girl they really captured the moment there this movie receives a thumbs up and a must see for any kind of elektra fan,Elektra
268,kramx_2005,Awesome!,9,6 April 2005,"This is not the best movie ever. That goes without saying and being fairly obvious in that all opinions are subjective. But, this should be the target of cynical abuse either. Watch this for your own mind's sake and then determine exactly what you think. Marvel has been mass producing these films which are decent films that entertain people. But, corporations have been trying to milk the public and allow little kids the chance to see this films too, so they cut the better, more explicit/graphic bits out, paste it on a reel and hope for the greens to come flooding in. This movie thrives despite all of that, though the pleading for a proper film in the version of a DVD's Director's cut is easily understood and should be listened to. Still, enjoyable! Plus, Garner is amazingly hot! It's good fun, to sum it up; give it a shot!",Elektra
269,evanfan1234,Woooo!!!!,6,14 April 2005,"Fab! I rented this movie, expecting something TERRIBLE, but I was pleasantly surprised. While Prout's acting is shaky, possibly even ""Daniel Radcliffe okay"" (meaning she didn't have to do much, she was pretty much the main character) at best, the character development of Abby is good. The few qualms I had was that the storyline was somewhat ""hyper,"" the evildoers, while interesting, seemed to be defeated very easily, and the character of Abby, while being fairly developed, seemed to be inconsistent. The film more than made up for that in scenery (I'm thinking HP3 good here!)and special effects (once again, HP movie good again!)This is sure to be a ""overlooked"" classic. I would also like to add that it is infinitely better to ""Daredevil"" and even ""Spider-Man 2"" (Yes! I said that!)",Elektra
270,freakyspana,excellent film,7,20 June 2005,"i thought this film was excellent, it had action and contained and kept to some of the mythology around Electra. The only disappointing part was the fact that there was no connection made to daredevil were Electra originated from, and this made the story feel a little shallow. But all in all a good film with amazing 'bad guys', possible the best bad guys in an action movie. I would have liked there to be a bit more on her mental state because the film seemed to me a bit in-personal and you didn't really get what she was thinking and feeling. It also starts of in a really random place and your left wondering how she got to the point your watching. Any way a good film all in all, i hope you enjoy.",Elektra
271,Pches,A wonderful sci-fi movie,10,5 July 2005,"I liked it a lot, it was really sci-fi and well done...it was confusing at times but it made sense in the end. if you like sci fi and/or Jennifer garner, you should watch this movie. the special effects are cool and it will have you quoting the movie for days. it's a sort of calm and quiet movie, when it's not an action scene. the action scenes were really awesome and contained some cool moves that will make you want to rewind and play, rewind and play...and then try yourself (which you shouldn't). Jennifer's acting is really well done, along with her co-stars, and you'll find yourself understanding the character from Daredevil more. you should only watch this movie if you are a fan of science fiction. if you love Jennifer garner, but hate science fiction, you might not want to watch Elektra.

272,Katich,Give it a chance,7,8 November 2005,"Wow, I finally saw it after hearing it tanked at the box office. I really liked it actually. They got a raw deal, and I think the 5/10 rating here is too low. It's only about 1hr 30min but it uses those very well. Sometimes it's good to watch a movie without all the tragedy mixed with the good, all the gray area like most movies today. There were great actions scenes, fight scenes, great special effects, some mysterious flashbacks, all woven to an intriguing story. I don't know anything of the comic book series so I can't comment on that except that expectations could have been higher for some people due to that. My expectations were quite low just from the little I'd heard of how it did with viewers. Chances are that if you haven't seen it yet then yours are low as well, you might find you like it.

There are a lot of really bad movies out there rated higher than this one.It was nice to see a female action hero on the screen. One of the things I liked most was the fact that here was this woman kicking butt as an assassin, and selling it. I am sure anyone meeting up with Jennifer Garner in a dark alley would be in for a big surprise.I don't know, maybe expectations were very high?

Jennifer Garner was brilliant as a menacing assassin who struggles with her demons when she is assigned to kill someone she becomes close to.What really made this movie stand out were the Villains who were anything but ordinary! which would satisfy the comic book enthusiast but also the character relationships and stunts would keep the other demographic happy.

The move itself takes cues from the older Chinese movies and adds to that with great acting. Never once did I feel like I was going to laugh at the way the lines were spoken. the movie has a nice dark flair to it and each character has depth, unlike most movies, and none moreso than Elektras herself. Each person Male or Female should come out having found a relation to her in some way. the action was not over the top, but actually very believable and it was well paced from the start.

It wouldn't make sense to try to make a movie from a character that in some cases is 50+ years old and make it follow one of many story-lines.It's no different than trying to pick a certain illustrator's style and make a movie based on that alone. Look at Superman, how many different visions of him are out there? If you look at the movie for what it is, it's a good movie. Yes, the acting can be better, so what, it's still good.I would rank this movie along the same lines as Daredevil, but perhaps not quite along with Spiderman.I found the movie to be interesting from start to finish with only a few short-lived dry spots. Perhaps the action sequences could have been more intense, and weren't quite up to Marvel standard, and there are a few places in the movie where things don't quite make sense, like something was left out, but overall the movie is in the better than average category.",Elektra
281,rockgrant,Worst. Movie. Ever.,4,26 January 2005,"I can't believe all of the positive comments on this movie! It's terrible! A complete betrayal of the character Frank Miller created, and here's how: 1) Elektra would never befriend anyone, and would certainly have no qualms over killing someone JUST BECAUSE HE GAVE HER DINNER.2) Not enough people die. For a movie that's supposed to be about the greatest assassin in the world, this movie has a surprisingly low body count.3) Elektra would never, EVER let her agent talk down to her. I kept waiting for her to gut that slimy little bitch and hang him up by his intestines, but she never did. This is all disregarding the fact that Elektra would probably never have an agent in the first place, but if she did, she'd be the boss, not him.4) She cries like a little baby. Elektra does have feelings, yes, but they are buried under a skin so thick that practically nothing can cause them to surface, certainly not STICK BEING MEAN TO HER. What a wuss.I'm sure there's more, but I could only stand to watch half of this awful movie.And I can understand the need to tweak a character, and sometimes even change her completely, for the sake of the movie. Some things just don't work all that well on screen. But even disregarding all the changes made to Elektra's personality and watching the movie as a self-contained entity, it's still terrible. It's boring and insultingly stupid, and I can't help but think that sticking to the comic book could only have improved it.",Elektra
282,TheRealPeot,One of the better comic adaptations,7,15 January 2005,"The bad stuff first. The movie was way to short to use the full potential of the characters that actually had potential. Some of the intellectual stuff in the movie (yes, things like that happen quite often in the better comic adaptions, at least in my opinion) deserved much more time on the screen then it actually did. The bad guys were as flat as they come. That seems to be inevitable if a screenplay accepts the theory of ""pure evil"", the kind of villain that seems to be bad for badness' sake alone. Sad thing. The authors of the screenplay give some potential in the story away, too, by now and then accede to the ""taste of the masses"" to often. By the way, I really think what Hollywood perceives as the ""Taste of the Masses"" is way of the mark. I sincerely believe that we the people can stomach a lot more serious story than they believe. But that seems to be a sad fact of modern culture. And finally, Stick, the ""Yoda figure"", that's what I like to call the just as inevitable mentor of the hero, was just as misplaced and flat as the villains.Now to the fun stuff: Why do I still think that Elektra was 1) worth viewing and 2) one of the better action flicks of the last two years? Oddly enough, most of the positive stuff seems to focus on the character Elektra herself. Let's get the obvious stuff out of the way first, shall we? Jennifer Garner is eye candy perfectly to my taste. Oddly enough, I liked her far more in the nondescript long-sleeved (but clinging ;-) ) black outfit she wears in the movie most of the time then in the over-the-edge of corniness red stuff she wears on all the posters. But she is also the top actor of the whole stuff, and with a vengeance. Her confident and powerful, but pretty low-key portrait of Elektra is a soothing contrast to the swaggering, over-confident attitude most comic heroes (actually, most heroes) of Hollywood action flicks sport. It is a good thing that the character actually gives Garner enough background to actually have someone to perform. The role of Elektra develops a good deal during the movie, and this struggle with herself is, at least to me, far more interesting then the halfhearted battle of good vs. evil that is the forefront plot line of the movie. Luckily, the movie dedicates a good deal of screen time to this plot element, and this is what heaves Elektra out of all the other comic adaption rabble and far above catastrophes like ""Catwoman"". Oh, and the fighting scenes and some of the optics in the movie were fun enough to watch to help me over the plot droughts.Overall I can say the following: If you enjoy pure optics and fighting scenes enough to not care that the emotional background of some of the fighting people has the depths of the Zelluloid the movie is made of, then the scattered plot line jewels hidden in ""Electra"" will be enough to make you enjoy the movie. Oh yeah, and being a fan of comic books in general helps, too.",Elektra

The Elektra costume is a bit daft and some of the characters kinda appear, have massive segments and then become unimportant/unmentioned for the rest of the film but I liked every character in this film, the villains were all great even if some of them get dispatched a bit too easily and that's it. That's all the ""buts"" and bad points I can think of. The flow and the action scenes were great and it feels like there's a nice level of character development in this (unlike DareDevil), I don't have a clue who Elektra is in the comic book world or how she is supposed to be but you don't need that to enjoy this film (as it should be).

The change of costume back to the comic book character's traditional red was good. I like the fight scenes, especially those between her and Will Yun Lee were excellent. After watching a commentary and finding out that they were, in fact, fighting with real weapons I was more impressed. Working with swords and sais is not for the faint of heart and can be very difficult, as I have found in my martial arts training. I love the shots of Elektra in the training camp. The character of Stick is great! I like the story line, though I feel they should have possibly worked some nod to the relationship to Matt from Daredevil.

Granted there were areas which I would have changed if I was the director, but on the whole the film delivered. I thought the story was fantastic. The premise seemed perfect - woman corrupt by the world finds her redemption. However, the whole magic thing was a bit risky from the start. I must say though that it was put across quite well. The main problems I found were that Abby shouted Elektra's name way too often, which was kind of irritating. Also the best fight scene (stick fight) was barely shown, the logic as to why lost on me as it looked great. The final scene I also found a little corny and predictable. That said, the earlier scenes were very well done and effective. I think Elektra could have been much better if the later half of the film had been like the first, which was brilliant. Garner acted well and I think Elektra does deserve a second chance for a sequel. The film did leave the idea of a sequel open and perhaps with a better script, could lift the Elektra franchise to the level of other successful Marvel films",Elektra

293,Brotha-From-Anotha-Motha,All I can say is...wow.,1,17 January 2005,"From the sweeping start of this motion picture to the energetic bedsheet climax, this picture is a sure likely picture to receive some accolades by next Oscar season. Several aspects of this movie are so wholly successful and only add to the tone and mood.Jennifer Garner's performance is nothing short of fantastic. Her body language alone shows that she is ready for more roles like this that demand so much of her personality and acting skills. The scene of her contemplating on whether to kill a father and his daughter is one for the books. Garner's sex appeal also doesn't hurt, as she has quite a nice look and is not hard to watch in close-ups. This movie isn't a one-person show though.Also stunning in this movie is Terrence Stamp, who plays an old man named Stick. Not only does he carry most of the dry humour of this movie, but he also is blind. And you can't get any better than that. The scene where he stares blankly but you know he can't see is just a measure of how fantastic this movie is.The movie's plot centers around Elektra, as she has returned from the dead after dying in Daredevil and exacted her revenge as an assassin-for-hire. Of course, this means the first person she gets close to ends up being her next target. She totally calls it off, helps the man and his daughter to safety, and it begins a sequence of events leading up to a battle with her employers, the Hand. With a few surprises every once in a while AND blind people, this will more than likely prove to be one of the best movies ever made. You can have your Citizen Kane, Star Wars, and Casablanca. When it comes out on DVD, I'll stick with my twelve consecutive viewings of Elektra on a Sunday night going into Monday afternoon.Note: I got in for free, but you should buy a ticket for each show that day. Trust me, it's worth it. You'll get something new out of it every time.Other note: This is coming from a reviewer that hates Star Wars, Casablanca, Pulp Fiction, Boondock Saints, Reservoir Dogs, ANY Johnny Depp or Tom Hanks movie. They are all pieces of trash. My favourites include Howard the Duck, Cube, Darkness, and of course, The Stupids.Thank you.",Elektra

Don't go see it.I really can not find a single thing I liked about this movie.",Elektra
296,tribalfire,What the heck is going on,1,14 January 2005,"This is just another comic book movie based on a comic that 98% of America has either never heard of, or never seen. It was only put out to give fan-boys the opportunity to say ""I liked the comic before it was a movie! *snort!*"" The effects are out of place, the actress is terrible (tho hot), and 65% of it is irrelevant to the other 35%. In other words: It was actually worse than Daredevil, and that says A lot. The music is horribly out of place, the score actually drew you -away- from the movie rather than doing its job of accenting it or pulling you along. As for the lighting goes, it was all unmotivated. Lights on characters that didn't have a logical source, lights from sources that were way too bright, it had worse lighting than Batman and Robin. I don't have much else to say to be nice to this movie, trust me I held back.",Elektra
297,thegreatkronk,Who does Bowman think he's kidding,1,14 January 2005,"Rob Bowman likes to portray himself as some sort of pioneering elite A-list director.But Elektra is the true Bowman vehicle. It proves he has no taste or originality and that his ego is driven by money alone.A piece of junk. Not even junk food, where it feels good going down and after wards you feel sick. This is insultingly bad. It's like some bad 80's action movie with 2004 production values, although the movie is still cheap looking so I don't know exactly where the money went (besides Garner's pocket). Maybe it was one of the ten effects houses credited and now one bothered getting competing bids. The effects suck by the way, proving that effects are only as good as their conception.Everyone involved should be ashamed, but who cares since all that are involved are hacks to begin with.Please let this be the end of Superhero movies, fitting since it is the nexus/ black hole of quality. Actually let it end after Superman and Batman Begins. Those have a chance of greatness. That way we end on a good note, but we all know it won't end especially if it's a good note.This is crap. have you gotten the picture yet. As bad as LXG, but this doesn't have Connery. Stamp is a good actor, but he's not Connery (where watching him do anything is pretty much entertainment).Just because one of the five writers that helped write X2 wrote this does not mean it would have been good.The reason X2 was good was because of Singer. He was able to corral good writing out of five people.Rob Bowman is an arrogant hack who ruined Reign of Fire, the only reason that movie is any good is some of the story fought it's way through the piled on crap and poor direction. Sometimesyou can tell when the story was just bastardized on the way to the screen. reign of Fire was one of those.And X-Files was okay, but nothing great.Somehow this guy thinks he was responsible for X-Files since he directed and produced a bunch of episodes. Sorry - wrong. X-Files, sometimes great, sometimes incredibly overrated is all Chris Carter's baby. Bowman didn't write any episodes. So I don't know where his arrogance comes from.Is it from directing that never seen crappy Seth Green comedy from 1993,""Airborne""? Anybody see it? No!Elektra only proves he is only as good as the writing. In fact it proves he is an absolute hack without good writing.",Elektra
298,yasiru89,Why do people rate this bad?,10,10 April 2005,"I recently got around to watching Elektra, (not thanks to the less than positive comments on IMDb, but to my love for comics) and I'm glad I did. The movie is far fetched and the plot has a few gaping holes ,but a length extension would've addressed all of them! If one is to truly like a movie they should embrace the fiction as well as they do the fine details. I think one of the crucial elements that could have tipped the balance of this movie onto the better side of the critics would have been Matt Murdock. He would have made it very worthwhile and would have added a whole new dimension to Elektra's emotional scene. Jennifer Garner was the most influential character as it should be. Why they didn't give her an academy award is a mystery to me. A better story and more atmosphere without even a bit of cheap effects will do wonders for E. I for one am eagerly awaiting a sequel!",Elektra
299,song_bird2103,"To each his own opinion. And, in my opinion, this movie kicks super butt.",10,16 January 2005,"*~May contain spoilers~* 'Kay, first off, I already knew that Jennifer Garner could pull the role of Elektra off. I mean, when she stabbed the dude on the roof with her sai...that was bloody brilliant. I loved that scene, and I am still thinking about it. It had a nice amount of action, though not enough. I would've loved to see Jennifer in the signature outfit more than twice. Also, with how the villains were thought up, that was also nice. I liked how Elektra kept having flashbacks of her mother's death, and how the image of Kirigi slowly sifted in. The fighting was incredible. The actress who had the privilege of playing Abby Miller was awesome. I read this in another review and, yes, the colors are absolutely terrific. The lip-locking scene between Typhoid Mary and Elektra was beautiful. I mean, the detail of how there was a ring of dead leaves around Elektra. Truly remarkable and artistic. The feud with Typhoid and Abby was great, too.The one problem and the only problem with the movie is that the villains, such as Kinkou, Stone, and Tyhpoid, died WAY too quick before they could be more appreciated. So, if there was a second installment to Elektra, then I would definitely go see it, if it was fixed up a little bit more. Jennifer Garner did an excellent performance and is remarkable as Elektra. Well done to the cast and crew. 9/10 Definitely worthy for some things such as...""Best Villain"" and ""Best fight scene"". And, actually, the director deserves an award. His dedication to this movie and his confidence paid off.So, yes, to each his own opinion. And, in my opinion, this movie kicks super @$$ like no other. I didn't even really like Blade, X-men 1 and 2 (geek of both)or Catwoman this much. They were all great movies, in my opinion. But, still, Jennifer won my heart as Elektra. She was brilliant. So, if you're going to go see this movie, then go see it. And, for goodness sake, do not waste any of your time reading gruesome reviews. Because, trust me, that's the only thing that you will wish you didn't waste your time on. GO SEE ELEKTRA!!!",Elektra
300,speedster1331,I liked it ....but,10,14 January 2005,"OK I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. It was a good movie, but could have been better, I give it and A-. Jen is awesome and the critics who say this is a bad movie need to be fired!!!! and anyone should make up their own mind about the movie. I don't want people to read what I wrote and decide its a good movie. GO SEE IT FOR YOURSELFS! It is good and you wont be mad you spent money on it I promise. The visual effects and fighting scenes are intense, and some of the characters are incredible and make the movie worth while. I would love to see a second Elektra with more action and other intense actors to thicken the plot. I don't think that the producers will make another, but there is always hope. Jen keep going girl, your doing great and we all love ya.Jason",Elektra
301,katiffy_noomestar_quack,my comment on Elektra,10,16 January 2005,"when i first saw Daredevil. i was amazed of how well jennifer garner fought and stuff. She was also pretty in that movie. I love daredevil, but most of all i watched Elektra yesterday and man to me that movie is the BOMB. i loved it..when its because I'm a huge fan of jennifer garner and i would love to meet her someday, but i really liked the movie. if i watched it again i would still love it. i don't think i would get tired of it. except the part where she gets kissed by the gyrl. it was kinda like AHHH at first, but it makes sense..so yea. everyone who has not seen Elektra..GO SEE IT! i don't know about all you guys but I LOVED IT AND I WILL ALWAYS LOVE IT!!",Elektra
302,iron_monkey_,Huh?,3,13 January 2005,"This is absurd - aside from the fellow Australian who has reviewed this flick, I can't help but think that everyone else who has submitted a review so far was some way involved in the production of Elektra, considering how generous they were with their praise.Admittedly I'm not really a fan of comic-book-to-movie conversions so I didn't go in with many expectations, yet still I found Elektra to be incredibly underwhelming. The thing that irked me the most was the fact that there was SO MUCH in this film which went by unexplained, that left you thinking ""huh, what relevance does that have to the plot?"" or ""so how did that aspect of the character come about?"" I can only hope that these are things which are perhaps explained somewhat in Daredevil, which I have no intention of seeing.Furthermore, the behaviour of the characters in this film appear to do an about-face at random moments to suit the storyline, and don't even get me started about the utterly pointless romantic sub-plot. I'm also (still) scratching my head over the fate of Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa's character, which seems to have gone by unexplained.If I can give kudos to this movie for anything it would have to be the fantastic locations in which it was shot, but otherwise I gained little enjoyment from Elektra. I know we're supposed to suspend our disbelief for fantasy/action films, but almost everything in this film was so improbable or confusing (even by action film standards) that it simply frustrated me.Well, hell, at least Jennifer Garner looks damn good.",Elektra
303,smc27203,Great,10,14 January 2005,"First and foremost if you enjoy Alias, you will definitely enjoy this. Speaking from a female point of view, I enjoyed seeing a women kick some butt and still have a soft side. You take away from this movie that to look inside yourself is the greatest gift you can have. It is a movie I will definitely buy, as well as going with my friends to see it again and again. Jennifer can do no wrong. ER's doc in Elektra was much better then how he normally plays on TV. the daughter was perfect because in some ways you could see this being Elektra daughter she might of had with Daredevil if she had of lived. The special effects is definitely worth the price of admission",Elektra
304,Toolband,Excellent Flick! Would see again.,10,14 January 2005,"I've got to say, i went into the theater expecting to be disappointed. But i must say, the movie caught me totally off guard. The fact that there were'nt that many lines, but yet you always knew what was going on was quite impressive and enjoyable. I would'nt consider it a sequel to Daredevil, but more of a movie of it's own, though there are a few references to daredevil, nothing substantial nor had the plot have anything to do with daredevil. As for the action, i was definitely surprised, it wasn't fake looking at all, i really did enjoy it, the effects were done great as well. I'd definitely recommend seeing this one, give it a try, and never trust what critics say.I'd give it a solid 8.5/10.",Elektra
305,looney25ny,Elektra,10,15 January 2005,"I'm electric for Elektra! I really enjoyed this movie. It was typical Jennifer Garner, butt kicking action all the way. The Villains of the movie were great, however I would have liked to have seen more effort on the villains part because they have great powers which would have added more excitement to the movie. But, then again Jennifer needs no help in the excitement area. My favorite villain was tattoo. I would have liked him to have been able to fight a little more. She was great! I give this movie a ten. Her high flying sword action was amazing. She gives strength and power to the Elektra character. ""Finally"" a leading man having to be rescued by a women! She also make me want to live at the gym.

I expected something like an action movie with a vengeance motivated female warrior. And the introducing action scene looked a little bit like that. But at the end: the movie is not worth to be seen, not even on DVD or for free.A vague story about ""good against evil"" and a superhuman female warrior in the center of this fight. Could be interesting? Maybe, but it isn't. The action scenes of the movie are approx. 10 min in total and not even good. The audience waits in vain for something worth to see. The character ""Elektra"" is superficial and uninspired.I cannot blame the people who left the theatre before the end of the movie nor the people chatting next to me, because it was one of the most boring movies I've ever seen.",Elektra

The reason critics are being nasty is because a woman is playing the hero and saving a man and his daughter. The music is great, Jennifer Garner is a great actress, and the special effects and fight scenes are well done and don't look overdone. Go see the movie, it will not be a waste of your money or time. It's only an hour and a half long. Based on the ending it looks like they will be making another one in the future.

Sure, it started out a little slow (all those flashbacks of a young Elektra), but after that I was totally hooked. But I do have to say that this movie could've been better.Plus, Jennifer Garner was in it so you would think that her star power would bring in people, but I guess the same thing happened with Catwoman. All those stupid critics and the failure of Dare Devil made this great movie flop. I hate today's critics. But I do have to say that this movie could've been better.

It was really interesting to see how the character, Elektra evolves through out the movie. Kristen's character provided slight humor to the movie. It is a typical comic book type of movie, so if one does not like comic book stories, one might not enjoy this movie. The special effects for the villains were interesting, but fake at times. People should go see it and give it a chance. If you enjoy the Batman movies, you should enjoy this movie. In my opinion, it was much better than Daredevil. When I was leaving the theater, many people were commenting on how they liked the movie. Children who are into fighting flicks will enjoy this movie as well, but be advise that there is violence in this movie.",Elektra

I had the WORST headache! I grew up with comics...this was a disgrace to ""comic book movies"" or movies based on comic books (whatever you wanna call em). Terrible fight scenes, obnoxious younger girl, sappy storyline...you didn't even get much chance to become familiar with the villains. And they vanish in a nice poof of smoke as if, as my friend put it, you are playin an ""E for Everyone"" game with no blood. I know most comic book movies are only loosely based on them...but you might as well come up with your own idea if you are gonna change it so much. Elektra was resurrected by the Hand...but not in this. And I HATE when they randomly try to throw in a love story in these comic movies--X-men and Spiderman, as well as others, had it in the comics, and it was important, so that was OK. But the one in this was lame. I like action movies, and this was more drama. It was a waste of money. Lets put it this way...at our big stadium theater, they had already moved it to the SMALL, 9-row room...and it was not even half full on a Friday night. Yet the parking lot was full. Everyone in the theater groaned the whole way through. My boyfriend, our friend, and I all left with a VERY bad taste in our mouths.

311,kkuklewi,High expectations accompanied with a slight disappointment,5,24 January 2005,"As my friend was walking out with me he made a comment on how good the movie was. Of course everybody has their opinions and I respect that. So here's my take of the movie: I admit that before the movie started I was expecting a lot of action. It turned out Elektra was more story oriented. Usually this isn't a bad thing, and Elektra delivered an exceptionally well told story. But it was the lack of action that I became disappointed in. The locations of the shooting of the movie were spectacular, and Jennifer Garner delivers an outstanding performance. But this movie would be receiving better reviews if it wasn't for the lack of action.Bottom line for Elektra: If you have seen the trailers you might be a little disappointed after you see the movie. However if you are interested in a story that is emotionally well told, then this is the movie for you. It isn't a waste of money, but I honestly thought this was going to be one of the year's best. 5/10 stars.",Elektra
312,markolomeu,Elektra Takes A Few Too Many Stabs,10,21 February 2005,"Why are so many people so cynical about this movie? Or any superhero movie in general? Jennifer Garner and the rest of her ensemble cast did a great job at bringing this film to life. This is a character, with her own book in the Marvel universe that is so complex that trying to classify or categorize her and adventures and background that relate are vague and mysterious, which adds to the allure of the film and character, also leaving scripting to be open-ended and leaves room for alterations to adapt a piece comic fanfare into a Hollywood film designed to please fan boys and new audiences alike, which is what this film sets out to do. And, it succeeds pretty well. Yes, changes are made, but aren't all scripts? Spider-man changed considerably to fit modern days and science, all to meet budget and Hollywood executive needs. But these people worked so closely with Frank Miller and Marvel on this film , or for any in that matter, to make the comic fan following a piece of entertainment, which didn't have to be done at all. But the fans wanted it, and then they do the 180 turn around when they get what they want and hate it?Honestly, this film really isn't THAT bad; it is the cynical perfectionist fan boys locked in their parents basements at 30 years old who spend their lives devoting themselves to this stuff that it ruins it all for the rest of us.Yeah, I grew up on Marvel comics myself and I loved Fantastic Four, Daredevil, Spider-man, all of the comics and teams. However I moved on and matured; I grew up, but still retained an appreciation and entertainment value and memorable fondness of these childhood/teenage stories and can enjoy these films because I can see where the line is drawn between purity and adaptation, fact and fiction, reality and entertainment.I'm not saying we aren't entitled to our opinions, or else, why would I, or any of us even bother with such sites and reviewing. All I ask is that you ease up on some of this negative hating and scoffing you all do so well here at IMDb and give people the chance to decide for themselves, or even just say it ""how it is"", not over-zealously devoted to ruining everything because it isn't your vision. After all, if the tables were turned, your vision, may just have been as awfully accepted, when all that effort goes into it. Just ease up and remember it is a movie. In this case, the formula given (1 beautiful woman+special effects+easy and uncomplicated plot= decent tribute to original material) works well enough to be seen a few times or owned on DVD, but without proper and level support, you people will destroy move-making single handedly by being so selfishly involved in this.Elektra was really great; give others the chance to decide for themselves and lighten up!",Elektra

314,dave-1591,Am I watching the same film???,2,14 June 2005,"OK, massive spoiler alert. But really. Was I actually watching the same film as you guys who liked it? And my wife and son? What were they watching? My problem is with the consistency of the characters and the plot. Hard to know which angle to take this from because it's such a mess, but here goes.So, at the start we see the wraith-like, red-clad Elektra. I mean, what happens to her? Does she ever come back? It seems to me there is later only some female archer with powers similar to those demonstrated by Matt Damon in Bourne 1 and 2. Her ability to go supernatural seems harshly diminished after the opening credits. OK, there are flashes. But they most certainly do come and go.Or shall we take the plot? What is actually supposed to have happened? Terence Stamp is supposed to have hired her for 2 mill to take out the beloved Treasure and her father as some test of character? Just so she won't do it and find out her heart is pure? And if the whole scheme is his then what is the subtle and sophisticated Hands guy up to? And do the fantastically talented Treasure and her hunky father know that it is all a cunning test? Do they know she is out to kill them? And do they know she won't do it really? And if the rubbish Treasure is such a superstar martial arts champion then why is she so dorky when Elektra catches her? And where are her moves then? And why was she nicking that pendant? And by the way, if you are a supercool assassin who has to mop her DNA after her then why do you go around calling yourself Elektra, which happens to be the name of an ""urban legend"" assassin who is surely no relation? I mean, surely everyone who meets you is going to have to just die? And can Terence Stamp really play pool when he is blind? Or is he just faking? (I think the latter.) I really liked the X-men stuff and other comic book cross-overs but I really didn't need to have my intelligence insulted, got drunk, ambushed in an alley outside the pub, kicked around a bit and then had noxious substances poured all over it just to give the director an amusing anecdote to tell his friends about he totally robbed me of my DVD rental.Anyhow, Jennifer, none of this is personal and if you and your husband are ever in London then do get in touch and I will show you all of the cool places to drink in Muswell Hill (it won't take long).",Elektra
315,npowers,"Not terrible, but pretty bad",3,14 April 2005,"Marvel's _Elektra_ has some good things going for it: the art direction and action direction in particular are high caliber. It's the way the characters are handled that drags the movie down. The characters aren't exactly poorly drawn; it's more that they aren't fleshed out enough to be either well or poorly drawn. Garner (for example) does a great job at the beginning of making Elektra interesting--tense, reserved, and afflicted by guilt and neuroses. The problem is that we don't get any closer to the character by the end of the film. It's not even clear what her ""superpowers"" are supposed to be. She can see 10 seconds into the future, and she's handy with a knife--yet she seems to kill the final enemy, a moves-faster-than-the-wind swordsman (a conceit used a bit too much in this movie), with a lucky random strike (demonstrating her ... indomitable spirit?). Similar things could be said about the other characters, who are left mysterious without rising to the level of being intriguing. Leaden and occasionally hackneyed writing doesn't help (""You speak in riddles, old man."") The other big problem is in the overall setup: there are two sides, both groups of vaguely far-eastern occultists who strive to attain Tao-ish calm and balance in the world. One group is, we are told, good, and the other evil. You can see the problem: how do we tell them apart? Apparently, it suffices that the ""good"" guys wear white robes and live in a woodsy commune, while the ""bad"" guys look sort of sinister. It's weak; we need to see some modicum of plausible motivation among these people in order to enter the movie's (admittedly enticing) atmosphere of fantasy.",Elektra
316,Laurie_clark,Great movie,7,3 July 2014,"Jennifer Garner did a great job, and I found the movie quite refreshing and action-packed. The action sequences , flash backs, and cinematography were well done. I also enjoyed the music and sound effects. I recommend it because there are so few female action hero stars which get recognition. This was a fun, energetic, interesting watch. The Japanese language and historical references were also fascinating. I thought the camera angles were good as was the character development. The CGI tattoo was also well digitalized.

The 100 plot holes that you could throw Kathy bates through with a little space left over for that winging lard bag rosy O'Donnell! 3. Yes Jennifer garner is hot, but she looks butcher than Orlando bloom in this flick (bad example). regardless, i hate this ""serious face"" she gets which is summed up by a lowering of the brow, sucked in cheaks and pursed lips right before she goes flying through the air with one of the worst fly wire effects where it would look more natural if you got her to climb up ladders then swing of them via a hanging vine! 4. Have i already mentioned that she was gladly killed off in daredevil..? 5. And finally, (this isn't really a reason) the fact that (many) people gave this movie a good review because of all the ""pretty colours"" worries me, am i a movie elitist snooty prick...? yes but please can Americans just stop watching fox news for movie reviews and their opinions on everything and try a little festival cinema, stuff with a little more heart. Movies made and celebrated for the scripts and the acting opposed to how many 3D effects, G rated kisses, and cheesy one-liners that could be packed into an over-budgeted 1 and half hour meat-market with the latest Hollywood starlet to ""accidently"" show her tits on E channel and just so happens to be sleeping with James Cameron, starring in it......PHEW!

318,enuf3,From someone who knows nothing about the Elektra comics...,9,21 July 2006,"Yeah it's a little late, but just recently I have seen the Elektra movie. The reason for holding off so long was because of the reviewers who gave the film a bad rating. But, in my pure boredom, I sat and watched it. Let me start by saying the only knowledge of Elektra that I have, was whatever we saw and learned from her in the Daredevil film (a rather bad film). I never read an elektra comic, novel, or anything Elektra related. And well, all I can say is, I understood the movie, the characters, and could even fill in plot holes without the help from the other Elektra sources. But still, I have read comments in which people say they don't understand it at all and that the movie was pure garbage.Personally, I thought this movie was fantastic. It reminded me a lot of the more recent movie, X-Men The Last Stand. The characters were all great, including the sub villains, and the story was simple, but excellent. It's one of those films where you just have to sit down and have a good time. If the story isn't good enough for you, then enjoy the characters, enjoy the awesome action scenes.. Have fun with this movie. Don't sit down and expect it to be some masterpiece, but rather what it really is... a movie. A form of entertainment.",Elektra
319,mossikukulas,It's a good thing I waited for the DVD...,4,10 June 2005,"When watching the trailer for this film I had an epiphany. Is it like the films that give away everything in the first 30 secs of the trailer? Are in truth all the fighting scenes in the trailer, all the fighting scenes in the film? Exactly...It's a good thing I didn't watch this at the cinemas. I was quite excited to be perfectly honest as I used to be a Marvel Comics fan back in my teenage years and Elektra was a character that left quite an impression. She was a dark, mysterious, sly character killing people with style. Jennifer Garner who is indeed sexy is probably the last person for this role. I'd imagine someone like Kelly Hu would be more appropriate. It's really freaky watching Jennifer Garner gallop around like a stripper or looking throughout at least half of the film as if she's constipated.As for the supernatural assassins who actually were her friends in the original comic book storyline they look like they escaped with the costumes from the Xena set and marched in this film only to disappear in a whiff of green smoke(?).I may be too critic but Jennifer Garner was good in Alias, she even was good in 13 going 30. Nevertheless I wouldn't recommend that film to anyone who has read a few comic books with Elektra in 'em. Stick was good, then again Terence Stamp made Stick look good.I give 4/10 for some semi-decent action scenes and for Stick of course. I'd watch Daredevil again and I didn't even like that one.",Elektra
320,Ariannahx,For those with no depth.,8,2 July 2005,"I have noticed in many comments, message board discussions, and of my peer group there is confusion of this film. That there is no relevance in certain actions of Elektra. However, there are many pieces in this film that have been written in for the real fans of Elektra, the ones whom collected the comics. Such as Elektra having OCD, if you look deeper with certain clues the movie gives you, you will find why she has this. If you fail to after a viewing or two, you are missing much of her emotions and past.Overall, those who are into special effects, fight scenes, suspense. This is a film worth seeing for such a viewer. An excellent work on the original score music, which I could not have found a single flaw in. Might I add, pay very close attention to the beginning. One can be easily fooled the first time around. There are only a few scenes where you have a bit of down time, waiting for the next roll of excitement. Such as the apparent kissing/love scenes. Which is the only thing I fail to see the true purpose behind it, other than perhaps loneliness as the exception.They have done an excellent way of putting Elektra's life together in a film. There are of course, sections they could have written better --which can never really be avoided with any movie that was once written down. If you have no intentions of really 'reading' what is between the lines, this is not a film you should look into seeing. As you may be left quite confused in some sections. This is a movie that did leave me feeling quite satisfied afterwords.",Elektra
321,nightbird_nz,maybe it's only for guys......,2,19 June 2005,"Movies can not be rated on the same scale, so even if we put this in the right category of movies (ie action type movie where storyline is optional) it still rates poorly in my book. It was slow, with hardly any action worth while of any comment. There are other user comments regarding storyline going all over the show and not making much sense, and having seen Daredevil doesn't help the matter whatsoever. Still Daredevil wasn't the best movie ever, this one is even less likely to fall into that category. I watch plenty of movies, many more than once and unfortunately this movie was a trial for me to get to the finish. Which leads me to my summary comment, maybe the movie was made as to how to get the Jennifer Garner in various shots and angles with ultra fitted clothing welding bad-*** weapons........",Elektra
322,wayneski,lack of depth also kills,4,20 June 2005,"where to begin....., i can gripe about dozens of things about the movie- lackluster acting from garner, continuity problems , the little annoying girl, but i'll start from the core of the movie, -the ripping off of Asian culture by Hollywood execs. why do critics and the public loathe this movie? its presentation was SOULLESS. i wanted to love this movie but was betrayed by its paint by numbers production. 1. the character of ELEKTRA is hallowed ground, revered because of Frank Miller's works in Marvel. garner is not believable as Elektra. she is a fish out of water and out of her league in a martial arts movie. yes, this is a martial arts movie and she is woefully ill prepared. shes a red head ,Elekra is dark haired and not from any town USA. her fight scenes and movement throughout the movie screamed CONTRIVED. nothing seemed natural. she is no killer. every time i looked at her i thought Sex in the City meets 3 Ninjas . want to see elegant? check out HERO with Jet LI or House of Daggers. i HATE it when movies are overshadowed by its star. the whole movie suffers, too many close-ups and posing. for all you Hollywood action movie execs-see The Professional2. the plot is water thin and incoherent. i felt nothing for the father and child, nor the hand, nor Elektra, Terence Stamp added a little depth. the villains died unremarkable, typhoid mary and the tattoo were the only interesting facets in the movie. since when did ninjas need ropes and a harness? got their gear from Big 5 sporting? the movie does not mesh well at all. too many odd elements CONTRIVED to fit the bill. a little girl with a magic chain? what is that? that should of stayed on the cutting room floor, was the little girl related to garner? is that why she got face time? geez. should i blame the director? the execs? the writers? this movie is juvenile, that is the problem. when made for mature audience, it would have probably delivered, made to appease 10 year olds-different ballgame. see Sin City.i will recommend it for the casual renter, its pretty harmless, for us who know better, look elsewhere.",Elektra
323,fell0w,Pretty basic action,4,29 June 2005,"Well, I just saw the movie and wasn't impressed. The one thing that annoyed me throughout the movie was that Garner played Elektra. To me, she's too much of a ""girl next door"" to be believable as Elektra, but other than that, she did a pretty good job on the role.Since I didn't know anything about the character Elektra beforehand, the background info in the movie came in handy. But, when you see the same flashback for the third time, it only gets boring. Although the flashbacks did ""evolve"" a bit between the times they are shown, you still think ""Yeah yeah we saw this one already, and that little change was only expectable"".The ""romance"" part in the movie wasn't really anything else than something to fill up some time with, but I guess you just can't do a Hollywood movie without at least two romantic scenes in it.Visually the movie is good, special effects weren't too big and the landscapes gave somewhat of a ""cosy feeling"" to the atmosphere.Not my choice for a movie evening with friends, but if you got extra time on your hands and nothing else to do, this isn't the worst way to spend your time (and money).",Elektra
324,jadechampioneljoria,Wow!,8,2 September 2015,"Wow...When I first saw the name, I wasn't too sure about this film, at the start I was bit losing it a bit...But it has got my eyes stuck on the film wanting to finish it. I was so addicted to it, Never thought it would pull me into it so much. I was looking for this type of films with those things in the film, and I've just caught it in time and I'm so happy that I have chosen the film. However, at the end, it was a little disappointed but so happy that I've watched it and ticked another film onto my watched list! Those who are thinking of it, GO FOR IT!",Elektra
325,rgraham-12,Great,10,19 July 2005,"Awesome Movie, well done and in great tradition of the comic book. Not only will you see this movie tie in with Daredevil (Though it WOULD have tied in better if the scene with Ben Afflick had not been removed (The DVD Has this deleted scene btw!)) You also get to see elektra evolve and change over the course of the movie, from The Time as nothing more then a bloodthirsty no emotion assassin to some one who realises that she has a reason to live again, and some one who is waiting for her.It can only be thought that they should make a DD/Elektra movie with the two of them together fighting and squabbling but loving each other anyway.",Elektra
326,lotmenkal,A lot of unnecessary hate,6,9 September 2019,"Its a fun movie, I really dont get all the hate this movie gets. If you dont see it as part of some bigger cinematic universe just as a fun standalone movie its really decent. A lot of people talking about the MCU but honestly the MCU is the same over and over and over again with a few exceptions.",Elektra
327,philipp-grafendorfer,Perhaps the worst movie ever seen....,1,25 July 2005,"When I got the movie today, my expectations were pretty high, because ""producers of x- men"" sounded good. But after 15 minutes I knew, that this movie did not have antything to convince me. Jennifer Garner ist pretty- no question- but unfortunately some people in Hollywood think, that beauty is enough for a good actress. Wrong thought. In this movie there are only beautiful people, but none of them is able to act properly. The storyline is reduced to the absolute Minimum, the emotions affect artificial and no low budget special effect is able to safe this movie from a disaster. I never read the original cartoons by Marvel, but in fact, they must be complete different and they surely have a decent storyline...",Elektra
328,lepouvoirdestrois429,Fabulous,10,5 August 2005,"Wow this movie as so good. I mean Jennifer Garner is the best actress ever to play Elektra. Man you got to see that movie, it rocked,I mean the fighting scene are just genius and I can't believe they did it with real weapon. The story was so great, with Abbe trying to do like Elektra such fun. Plus the guy was cute, I expected something really boring since people seems to think it was boring and not cool at all, but it was better than daredevil and I really do hope they will be another Elecktra, because this one was so so so so so so SO SO so so good you got to see that movie :d Elecktra outfit is way better than in the previous movie. And the way she use sarcasm and the old man omg he's so philoshophic with everyone. Though I didn't like Elecktra kissed another guy than Daredevil ....:( But in the DVD , in the deleted scene we see Ben Affleck/Daredevil coming back for Elecktra",Elektra
329,lilac-10,A very peculiar movie.,6,29 November 2005,"A largely incoherent plot, a kid sidekick, flashbacks a random love interest, an Old Blind Mentor - I should have hated this movie. Instead, the moments between Elektra and Abby were oddly touching, as was Elektra's struggle to be something other than a killer. Kudos to Jennifer Garner for giving a shallow film a heart. The visuals were gorgeous, and something about the design of the film was very attractive, letting the plot (what there was of it) drift along easily. The flashback scenes were eerie and well-used. The villains were used as throwaway special effects moments and were dispatched far too quickly, and yet the movie didn't seem to really hinge on them. The set-up was entirely two-dimensional, and yet the actors and the mood of the film took it somewhere else entirely. Worth watching.",Elektra
330,cjw8209212,Elektra is the best movie ever!,10,7 June 2006,"I think this movie is great, but it could have been better. Iwas watching behind the scenes on the unrated edition and they cut out so much stuff. I think there should have been more fighting but that can be for next time. Jennifer Garner was so good in the movie though, the fighting she can do and the twirling of her three pronged knives are amazing. I hope Jennifer Garner plays Elektra again because Rob Bowman was saying that he was willing to get another actress to play Elektra. My opinion, they can not get another actress to play Elektra it would just be wrong and everyone is so used to seeing Jennifer Garner and it would just be so weird without her.",Elektra
331,bennyboy8_9,Elektra,10,25 September 2005,Elektra is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is Jam Packed with Excitement and Adventure ranging from Martial Arts to very Powerful Characters. On the subject of Characters this Film has them spot on my favourite two being Elektra herself and Typhoid as they remind me so much of myself. Elektra being as cold as she is and Typhoid that can bring death to anything she Touches of course I don't bring death just a lot of pain and anguish. But I found as Phsycotic as the Characters may be I could really relate to them. Also Elektra carrying the best weapon ever invented by man the Sai's really entranced me into this Film it was just great and there was not one boring moment.,Elektra
332,FreakJess,Elektra beats Daredevil by a long shot!,10,15 October 2005,"This movie is based on the comic book series about a warrior that stands between good and evil. With Jennifer Garner playing the lead you can see the pain in her eyes. She is a hired assassin that gets hired to kill a single father and his 13 year old daughter. She can't kill him because she likes him and his daughter. A supernatural group ""The Hand"" wants the girl dead because she is the treasure. A prophesied child that can kill without warning. Elektra has had horrifying dreams all her life about finding her mother dead. In the movie she realizes that the person that killed her mother was ""The Hand"". Now she wants revenge. She contacts the leader of the supernatural part of the hand to meet her at her parents house an they can fight over the girls life. The girl gets killed by the old prophecy that does not want to be replaced. Elektra kills her and trys to bring the girl back to life. She finally makes this work. When the girls father comes to get his daughter you would think that Elektra and him would get tote but NO. Elektra walks out of the house and through the gate. THE END.",Elektra
333,Magnolia_Lover,"This ""movie"" killed my father and raped my mother.",1,24 June 2006,"Bad Bad Bad but not in the good way. I decided to rent this movie on the off chance that it may be one of those movie which are so bad that they're funny. ( see Frogmen, The Elite or Shredder). I'll avoid any discussion of the plot there isn't one.There is no reason why this movie could not have been enjoyable. And that is the most disappointing thing about Elektra. Nothing of interest happens. For example where was the cool fight scene at the end when all those ninja guys? oh wait that weak explosion killed them all.... right so what was the point of all that fancy swirly Sai action. None.What was the point of this Movie. None.Every time the movie built up some pace it was squished by a Tree.How about some story. Hmmm? Give those characters 3 dimensions. Hmmm? Maybe a little character development. Hmmm?This movie was so bad i have now taken note of every name in the end credits so that i will never have to watch a movie made by the same people who made this ""movie"".Avoid!!!1My score -5",Elektra
334,tielzwildchik,Elektra - great movie,10,26 February 2006,This was an awesome movie just as good as dare devili think they should make a sequel definitely .maybe let the two meet up again . great movie with great actors good job guys. i think that the movie was exiting all the way through i think that the movie was extremely well plotted i think that Jenifer garner is the best actress ever the movie very different from any other I've seen which is a good thing i will be sure to keep my eye out for the sequel go cast and crew you guys are awesome you rock !! my fave part in the movie is towards the end where elektra throws the sai through the hedges and fully kills the death chick it was awesome .,Elektra
335,ambercromer,I adore this movie and the characters,9,15 January 2019,"I'm truly shocked this movie didn't get a better review by most. I haven't read any of the comics, so I can't comment as to it's authenticity, but I was absolutely entranced by Elektra's character portrayal. Especially at the time this movie was made there were so few prominent strong heroines. I enjoyed the humanistic touches of her OCD disorder and how she distances herself from the other characters because of her trauma and loss. The rest of the cast was adequate if not Awesome. It was a beauty of it's time, in my opinion.
I just can't give it an out and out ten because I wanted even more of the magic. More backstory. More action. More film.",Elektra
