0,MartinHafer,"While it's VERY hard to care about the main character, the film is one of a kind!",9,24 September 2012,"This film is about an EXTREMELY manic Broadway producer (Roy Scheider) who burns the candle at both ends--pushing himself in such an extreme and unhealthy way that eventually he has a heart attack in the midst of a production. Will he survive? Well, while waiting to find out, the film takes an amazing turn. Up until the heart attack, it's a SOMEWHAT conventional film about the making of a play. BUT, after the attack, it suddenly becomes VERY surreal--with many song and dance numbers that explore death! In this sense, the film really is a lot like Fellini's ""8 1/2""--but with song and dance numbers! I could say more...but don't want to spoil what happens next. Just hold on...the final scene is one of the most amazingly stunning in film history!!""All That Jazz"" is one of those rare films that I didn't particularly enjoy BUT I really respected what it tried to do. While it is similar, in some ways, to a few other films (such as ""42nd Street""), the total package is wholly unique--and for that reason alone it deserves to be seen. But, I am warning you, it's very possible you won't like a lot of the film because the leading man is pretty awful--drinking to excess, using drugs to excess, using women to excess--heck, doing EVERYTHING to excess! Interestingly, the film's director, Bob Fosse, intended this as a sort of autobiography--so I assume Fosse was a very talented but incredibly screwed up man...AND, he welcomed the world to see this!! This was either a case of incredible narcissism or perhaps a cry for help or understanding--I have no idea which the case might be! I mentioned how ""All That Jazz"" is a lot like ""42nd Street"". This is because in ""42nd Street"" (the film), Warner Baxter is in many ways the manic Broadway producer that Scheider is in ""All That Jazz""--and, in the end, he burns himself out and dies--all for the sake of the show. As far as ""8 1/2"" goes, it's much more likely you've seen that and it's a very strange film that explores a film director whose life is VERY hectic and he retreats into fantasy and day dreams to cope with his out of control life. All these films are well worth seeing and would make a great triple-feature.By the way, less than a decade after ""All That Jazz"", Fosse really DID die of a heart attack at age 60. Talk about art imitating life!! NOTE: This film has many adult themes, language and nudity. Think twice before showing this to your mother or kids.",All That Jazz
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Wonderful, one of Bob Fosse's best films",9,12 August 2014,"The script is a bit of a jumble at times, with the odd groaner particularly with Wallace Shawn's one line(the worst line of the film and Shawn is wasted) and Schneider and Lange's chemistry comes across as a little wooden. But everything else about All That Jazz is so great, it is one of the better 1970s musicals and one of the most unique ones you'll see anywhere along with Ken Russell's The Boy Friend. All That Jazz looks spectacular, the editing, costumes and art direction all won Oscars that were richly deserved. The editing and cinematography is some of the most imaginative of any musical, the costumes are rich in colour and the art direction is wonderfully opulent. The score also won an Oscar which was also deserved, it captures all the glitz and glamour of musical theatre brilliantly with no over-sentimentalising. The songs are ones that you will have no trouble remembering, Take Off With Us being the highlight. And they are superbly staged and imaginatively shot with choreography that is unlike what you've seen before and since, plus it is very rhythmically driven(again the very erotic Take Off With Us is the standout, though Everything Old is New Again is very sweet). The reality parts of the story blend surprisingly well with the more fantasy-like ones, the reality stuff is often hard-hitting and unpleasant but very real like Joe Gideon himself while the fantasy has a real surrealism to it. Fosse's direction is truly impressive, yes some scenes like the death sequence is a touch self-indulgent but there is his usual pizazz and rhythmic precision while also very Fellini-esque, reminding one somewhat of 8 1/2. Roy Schneider gives a blistering career-best performance as a very sordid character with a good amount of complexity. Jessica Lange is alluring, Leland Palmer is equally solid and Ann Reinking is equally charming. The director-daughter relationship is touchingly done. Overall, a wonderful, if somewhat divisive, musical and one of Fosse's best alongside Cabaret. 9/10 Bethany Cox",All That Jazz
2,SnoopyStyle,it's his life,8,3 September 2020,"Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider) is a Broadway director on top of the world. He's got his own project. He's directing a side vanity project for his ex-wife Audrey Paris. He's directing the biographical movie of stand-up comic Davis Newman. He's a lifelong womanizer and it's a struggle with current girlfriend Kate Jagger who just wants him. He tries to be a good father. He's addicted to Dexy. He's burning the candle on all ends. As a teen, he performed in a strip club where his burlesque mother performed. Throughout the movie, he is talking to the Angel of Death, Angelique (Jessica Lange).This is Bob Fosse. It's a thinly disguised autobiography of his own life. As long as the audience knows this, it becomes something even more compelling. The best is him with his ex-wife. That scene of them practicing with the piano player is funny. It's a great companion to the recent TV show Fosse/Verdon. In the TV show, it's about the couple and that adds some emotional depth to the material. In some ways, the movie is missing the emotional complicity which that hilarious scene between the exes has in spades. This movie goes inside into the man with the Angelique character. It's both compelling and that I want more about his relationships. I love his time with his daughter. It's a fascinating life and well-told one.",All That Jazz
3,gavin6942,Musical Perfection,8,5 September 2014,"Director/choreographer Bob Fosse tells his own life story as he details the sordid life of Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider), a womanizing, drug-using dancer.Besides Scheider (who is at his best here), we get a young John Lithgow, Wallace Shawn and plenty of highly skilled dancers. Even those who may not normally like musicals or dancing will be drawn to this film because it is executed so wonderfully.As if the choreography and direction were not good enough, the plot is quite clever, too, existing in layers that may not make sense at first but show themselves as the film goes on. This is really a story of life and death, told with real passion as the creator (Fosse) had really lived it, and unfortunately did not live too much longer after the film's completion.",All That Jazz
4,lee_eisenberg,"he may think he's gonna die, but you'll feel like you'll live forever",10,2 October 2006,"In this most unusual musical, Bob Fosse offers a scathing look at his own career as a Broadway director/choreographer. Roy Scheider plays Fosse's alter ego Joe Gideon, a drinking, smoking, pill-popping, womanizing creep who doesn't know when to stop. Although this movie is usually called a musical, this is about as far from ""Oklahoma!"" as can be: it's gritty and overtly sexual, especially during one dance number.I would say that the two most effective scenes are: when Joe smoking and pops pills while taking a shower before wryly proclaiming ""It's show-time!""; and the whole hospital sequence. The latter shows just what sort of person Joe is at heart (pun intended): disconnected from reality, but ever joyful. Of course, his song ""Bye Bye Love"" is to be taken seriously. Fosse himself suffered a fatal heart attack a few years after the movie came out.Anyway, ""All That Jazz"" is a movie for the ages. You'll never want to forget it. Also starring Jessica Lange and Ben Vereen.""I did f--- him and he still didn't give me the job."" Yeah, I bet that it's probably like that.",All That Jazz
5,jboothmillard,All That Jazz,8,12 June 2006,"From Oscar nominated director Bob Fosse (Cabaret), this follow up, five years later, to his Oscar winning masterpiece, I certainly had to see again to properly get what was going on, and I'm glad I did. Basically Joe Gideon (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Roy Scheider) is the workaholic, chain smoking, drug taking and womanising theatrical director and dance choreographer who is trying to work on both a Broadway musical and film he is making. He does have the people who care about him, his Kate Jagger (Ann Reinking), his ex-wife Audrey Paris (Leland Palmer) and his daughter Michelle (Erzsebet Foldi), who try and stop him from causing himself so much stress and self indulgence, but he has had too long to make his body overly exhausted, and his heart condition is diminishing. Gideon is rushed to hospital after suffering a heart attack, he is placed in the ward admitted with severe angina, and despite the show production being postponed in his absence, the show still goes on in his imagination, where he also flirts with the angel of death, Angelique (Jessica Lange). The cardiovascular charts show no signs of improvement for Gideon, as he has been continuing to smoke in secret and causing more stress for his heart, and the only option is to perform a coronary artery bypass surgery. Meanwhile the show makers are debating whether the production can continue without him as director, but they decide instead to bet on the likelihood of Gideon dying to make their money back, which would give them a profit of $500,000. Gideon is having more surreal but dazzling dream sequences featuring musical numbers with Kate, Michelle and Angelique singing about his past experiences, direct to his hospital bed. The final parts of his own personal musical feature the five stages of death - anger, denial, bargaining, depression and acceptance, and we get a final hallucinatory extravagant number where Gideon himself gets involved himself on centre stage, of course in real life his life has ended. Also starring Cliff Gorman as Davis Newman, Ben Vereen as O'Connor Flood, Erzsebet Foldi as Michelle and Michael Tolan as Dr. Ballinger. Scheider creates both a sleazily charming and amusingly detestable character, the direction by Fosse (a dance choreographer and musical director himself) has created some fantastically eye-catching sequences, most based on his own experiences, all beautifully captured and edited with colourful background and sparkling costumes, adding up a highly entertaining musical drama. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction - Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing and Best Music, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and Best Picture, and it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography and Best Editing, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Production Design/Art Direction and Best Sound. It was number 14 on 100 Years of Musicals, and it was number 79 on The 100 Greatest Musicals. Very good!",All That Jazz
6,Woodyanders,First-rate adult musical exploration of Bob Fosse's life and career,9,22 August 2017,"Arrogant and self-destructive, yet gifted and driven stage director and choreographer Joe Gideon (a terrific performance by Roy Scheider) grapples with his own personal demons and failing health while trying to get a troubled Broadway production off the ground.Director/co-writer/choreographer Bob Fosse's barbed, vibrant, and exhilarating autobiographical love/hate letter to show business exposes all the behind the scenes backstabbing, fierce competitiveness, hedonistic excesses, raging over-sized egos, petty rivalries, irksome squabbling amongst financial backers, and constant womanizing with a bracing and brutal candor that's both poignant and profound in equal measure. Of course, Fosse certainly doesn't skimp on the ol' razzle dazzle: The bravura opening ""On Broadway"" auditions, incredibly erotic number ""Take Off With Us"" (Sandahl Bergman positively sizzles here), and the spectacular ""Bye Bye Life"" closer rate as three of the best and most exciting musical set pieces ever filmed.The splendid acting by the tip-top cast keeps this movie humming: Jessica Lange as seductive siren Angelique, Ann Reinking as Gideon's sweet, but log-suffering girlfriend Kate Jagger, Leland Palmer as Gideon's fed-up ex-wife Audrey Paris, Erzset Foldi as Gideon's precious daughter Michelle, Cliff Gorman as sharp-tongued stand-up comedian Davis Newman, Ben Vereen as dynamic dancer O'Connor Flood, Max Wright as antsy producer Joshua Penn, John Lithgow as smarmy opportunist Lucas Sergeant, and Deborah Gaffner as eager young hopeful Victoria. Giuseppe Rotunno's sumptuous cinematography provides an appropriately glittery look. A total pip.",All That Jazz
7,ccthemovieman-1,"He's Not Your 'Average Joe,' Thankfully!",2,19 June 2007,"Well, how about two hours of film footage about a chain-smoking, drug-taking, wife- cheating, hard-drinking, profane guy? Sound like fun? I don't think so.Roy Scheider plays ""Joe Gideon,"" who is really Ray Fosse, the famous dance choreographer. The story is based on Fosse's life....and it isn't a pretty one. I really liked the photography in this movie - that IS pretty, but the main character, as described above, was not a fun guy to watch. ""Sordid"" is an apt word for this biography.I'm sorry, but I am not attracted to depressing stories about people who are losers. It has nothing to do with Scheider, either, who I have always found to play interesting roles. This is painful story to watch and it's long: two-and-a-half hours. It could have been edited in a number spots, although it still would have been too sleazy a story for me.",All That Jazz
8,rmax304823,Dark Side of the Moon of Musicals.,8,6 May 2006,"There have been dark musicals before -- ""West Side Story,"" ""It's Always Fair Weather"" -- but this one takes the palm.When Bob Fosse had his bypass surgery he was still a relatively young man and the procedure was still in its initial phases, by no means routine. It's something to be scared of under any circumstances, but at that time the outcome was problematic in a way that it no longer is. It's as if Fosse were first in a long line.The musical numbers. They progress from realistic, excerpts from a show Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider) is choreographing and directing, to hallucinatory by the end, a frightening congeries of monsters and plastic anatomical models. When Gideon is asked how he feels before an angiogram and says, ""The truth? I'm scared,"" we can believe him.Scheider is a fine actor but this part really calls for a dancer. And what dancing we see. Such dedication, skill, and fitness, of a kind required only of athletes like tight ends. A viewer must pale with awe, seeing the rehearsals. And of the dancers, Foldi and Ben Vereen are particularly appealing. Oh, and Sandhal Bergman, whose bare bosom requires a review all its own. The songs are eclectic but innovatively arranged and orchestrated. Your fingers tap even as the characters die.Gideon dies, we are more or less told blankly, because he smokes, boozes, lies, and screws around. He is morally flawed. Big deal. The problem is that he dies because he was alive in the first place. It's not the tragic story of a fall from greatness -- no ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Coriolanus"" -- but a change from life to death. Would Gideon have lived longer had he become, say, a vegetarian? Maybe. Then he would have been granted more years in which to become old and faded and impotent and forgotten. I don't mean to be too glum about this but the movie itself raises these kinds of questions. Or, as Edgar Allan Poe put it, ""The play is the tragedy ""Man,"" and the hero the conquering worm.""Do not watch this movie if you have ever gotten drunk, lied, smoked, done drugs, or fooled around. I'd even hesitate to watch it if I'd used cuss words. But I must sum it up by saying that it is an example of how close any single human being -- Fosse in this case -- can come to turning his own failures into a work of art. What makes it as strong a fable as it is, is that Fosse does not give us easy answers. Even vegetarians must face eventual dissolution.",All That Jazz
9,moonspinner55,A dance with Death...,7,22 October 2005,"Bob Fosse's autobiographical look at the hectic life of a Broadway director/choreographer rehearsing a new show in New York City while concurrently editing his latest movie. Roy Scheider fabulously stands in for Fosse; as Joe Gideon, pill-popping, womanizing, self-destructive genius on the verge of collapse, it is Scheider's shining moment as an actor. Fosse paints himself as suspicious, paranoid, driven, indifferent, exhausted and horny. It's more than most of us want to know about the man, who seems intent on showing us what a creep he is...but a talented creep! The film doesn't particularly look good (it's a gray movie), though it has amazing musical flourishes and the self-styled bombast is actually rather amusing once you get the idea. Jessica Lange is beautiful in an early role as the Angel of Death (imagine Fosse explaining that role to her!), and Scheider's performance is really something to see (only occasionally does the camera catch him not knowing what to do). Fosse tries hard not to be pretentious, he keeps things playful and perky, and his ironic ending is bitterly funny. The film is alive and ticking--but that's not Fosse's heart, it's a time bomb. *** from ****",All That Jazz
10,Quinoa1984,a cheerfully ironic and devilishly self-indulgent plunge into the spirit of Bob Fosse,9,24 June 2007,"I should be inclined to say that All That Jazz is much too full of itself to really pull off as an entertaining comedy-musical. But then again, the whole tone of Fosse's ""semi"" autobiographical splurge, less so much a typical film, is to comment on self-indulgence in movies, while at the same time embracing it, going all out with crazy musical numbers involving rehearsed airline erotica and two Joe Gideons with one within-a-movie directing the other laid up on a hospital bed. But what does make it a deep work, as did Fellini's 8 1/2, which Fosse obviously loves to the point of hiring the spectacular Giuseppe Rotuno to do the cinematography, is that it laments the end of life by celebrating the enjoyable mania and despair of its protagonist. Although Fosse can't totally compare to the penultimate film about the creative crisis of an artist (the angel of death scenes are hit or miss, depending on the context, and unlike Mastroianni there seems to be too much forced on Scheider to be almost exactly like Fosse, at least in myth, with the cigarettes and pills and women), he does make it often exhilarating cinema, and hilarious cinema with the touch of someone who is cynical but not afraid of speaking the truth, about talent, creativity, love, and just plain living. Never has being and nothingness been portrayed with choreography so extravagant (if that makes sense)! The premise is actually very simple, as most musicals should be: Gideon is preparing his latest musical of free-wheeling sex and luridly fun (we're never too sure what it's ""about"" as he zones out completely during a script reading), and editing a film on the side, while also dealing with his many women on the side sometimes meeting one another in the bedroom, and his daughter, the one pure fountain of innocence who may be catching some of Gideon's attitude. But the stress, and pressure, of being on top of his game all the time knocks him out- on top of the usual barbiturates for f***ed up artists, leads him to the hospital with horrible heart problems, of which he doesn't take too seriously, even when he's on his last breath. Fosse turns tragedy into self-reflexive entertainment on a self-consciously buoyant scale; I can only think of Singin' in the Rain as another musical that is as explicitly fun- if not as dirty and outlandish- at portraying serious subject matter.Fosse aims maybe too high, if that's the only problem, particularly with a final musical number that is catchy as hell (and how could it not, shuffling off the mortal coil), if maybe TOO catchy, if that's possible. However this isn't something that becomes a deterrent, on the contrary it's like watching some acrobat out of a dingy Bronx hell-hole who puts on quite a show on the high-wire. Certain musical numbers will forever remain my all-time favorites, chiefly the 'rehersal' performance that Gideon puts on for the producers to see of a highly erotic number called ""Take Off With Us"", proclaimed approximately by his ex-wife to be ""the best thing you've ever done...you son of a b****"". Then there's the hospital-bed number, where deep-rooted psychological angst not only gets some up-beat razzle dazzle, but even a wink and a nod to Fosse's directorial style, (""you missed your line""). While the sub-plots put in place, namely with heel John Lithgow and the budget problems of the musical production, don't serve much of a purpose aside from slightly interesting fodder, leading only up to whatever great little moment, little weak or totally cool gesture Gideon may make, even when he's hooked up to a breathing machine.At the end of it all, what makes All That Jazz sensational movie-making is the combination of strong subject matter, of the flawed brilliance of a man such as Gideon- via Fosse himself- with a completely assured hand of style. The dancing is terrific, the camera movements are always apart of the action itself (Rotuno gets the frame almost to dance with the others), and Scheider is particularly great. Following the lead from a certain TV 'critic', I give it three and a half out of four balloons!",All That Jazz
11,edwagreen,All that Jazz- All that Mishugas (Craziness) ***,7,2 January 2011,"You can't take away the excellent choreography as well as the vibrant dancing by all concerned. That is staged quite well on all levels. While it is true that choreographer Bob Fosse tells his sordid life in this film, it is also true that the movie has an air of absolute craziness. There is a very thin line drawn here between reality and fantasy. True, Fosse depicts his addiction to pills as well as his incessant smoking. It's as if he has a death wish and he is standing defiant to death in his dance sequence scenes.I was surprised that he didn't totally put his nursing and physician staff in full dancing mode as well.This all being said, Roy Scheider totally captures the Fosse element and he did receive a well-deserved best actor Oscar nomination. Competing against Dustin Hoffman in ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" could not be overcome nonetheless.I did like the fact that when reality sets in at times, we see that business comes before everything, including the demise of its top director.Ben Vereen and Ann Reinking are fabulous in their respective parts of literally lighting up Broadway. Nonetheless, after a while, the film becomes tedious when that fine line of reality and fantasy become utter confusion.",All That Jazz
12,preppy-3,Depressing but brilliant,10,30 May 2003,"The life and times of Bob Fosse--oops!  sorry!--Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider). He directs, choreographs and writes Broadway musicals and the occasional movie.  He also has sex with every woman he can, is a chronic smoker...there's more but I don't want to ruin it.Basically, this is a character study and an absolutely fascinating one. This is Bob Fosse doing a movie about himself and showing his life in an extremely negative light.  I saw this movie when it first came out in 1980. I thought it was one of the most depressing things I had ever seen--but went back to see it three additional times.The acting is just great all across the board--Scheider is cast against type...and pulls it off.  In fact he was nominated for an Academy Award for this performance (he lost to DeNiro for ""Raging Bull"").  Jessica Lange is playing...let's call her Our Lady of the Oxygen Tank (you'll see what I mean).  Seriously, she has a difficult role and plays it beautifully. 
The direction is superb, mixing fantasy with reality seamlessly.  The songs are good and the dancing is just great (especially in one VERY erotic number about casual sex).This movie is not for everyone--I know of one theatre in which half the audience walked out demanding their money back--but, if you're game, you probably won't be able to take your eyes off the screen.Depressing but just great.  Fosse's best film (even better than ""Cabaret""!)",All That Jazz
13,writers_reign,A Lot Of Fosse Over Nothing,7,6 January 2010,"This is yet another hybrid that can't seem to decide whether it wants to be a drama, a musical, a drama with music or a musical with drama. Whilst it is undoubtedly dramatic - the leading character reliving some aspects of his life/career whilst undergoing heart surgery - it is not a musical in the accepted sense of the word. It is certainly full of music but is closer to that other non-musical musical A Chorus Line in that the music content consists mostly of highly-trained professional dancers rehearsing for one or another musical show. Whereas A Chorus Line did feature albeit in a minor key, several songs written specifically for the production, All That Jazz features numbers written earlier but suitable for the kind of dancing in which Fosse specializes. Whilst Roy Scheider as a thinly-disguised Bob Fosse is beyond praise you'd need to be a real Broadway Musical buff to get the 'in-jokes' such as Anthony Holland's spot-on take-off of Fred Ebb. If you like raw energy, well-drilled dancing and show biz you'll love it. If not ...",All That Jazz
14,grantss,Great drama,8,3 March 2017,"Great drama on the life and death of an artist (loosely based on Bob Fosse's own life, without the death part, of course, at that point). Original plot, which demonstrates the decadence, pitfalls and back- stabbing of showbiz. Very original direction by Bob Fosse, complete with musical dream sequences and time jumps. A bit too innovative sometimes, as it can be confusing.Roy Scheider acts out of his skin in the lead role. You can actually imagine Scheider inflicting the damage to himself that the movie portrays, so convincing is his performance. He was unlucky to lose the Best Actor Oscar to Dustin Hoffman for Kramer vs Kramer.Supporting cast are good too. Jessica Lange's part is not overly major, but All That Jazz did revive her career after King Kong almost killed it. Interesting to see John Lithgow in an early role.Great movie.",All That Jazz
15,evanston_dad,Razzle Dazzle 'Em,9,1 March 2006,"A never less than fascinating, barely fictionalized biopic about legendary choreographer and director Bob Fosse. The character in the movie is named Joe Gideon, but come on: he's in the middle of choreographing and directing a stage musical that looks an awful lot like ""Chicago,"" and he's in post-production on a film that looks an awful lot like ""Lenny."" I think we all know who this movie is REALLY about.It's self indulgent to be sure, and a bit of a mess overall, but it's just so damned accomplished in every way that it's impossible not to sit back and enjoy the ride, however destructive that ride might be. And boy is it destructive. You're going to feel like you need to go on a rigorous exercise regimen and a system-cleansing diet after watching the Fosse stand-in in this film abuse himself to death. This movie will quickly disabuse you of any illusions about the glamour of the show business world.Roy Scheider gives the performance of his career as Joe Gideon. My other favorite performance came from Leland Palmer as Gideon's long-suffering ex-wife (and presumably Gwen Verdon stand in). These two make poignantly obvious what made them click in the first place while at the same time conveying perfectly why they can't live with one another. Ann Reinking plays Ann Reinking, one-time girlfriend to Fosse who does the same honors in the movie. And before anyone knew who she was, Jessica Lange played a very ravishing angel of death.""All That Jazz"" isn't as tight or as powerful as Fosse's previous musical, ""Cabaret,"" but that's largely because it's so much more insular as a movie. It's really about the demons plaguing one man, and it doesn't have any broader context than that. Whether or not you like it will depend heavily on how fascinating you find the world of New York theatre, and how much you care about Joe Gideon in the first place. To his credit, Scheider is able to make Gideon an entirely sympathetic, if not entirely likable, character.And if there aren't any musical numbers to rival the razzle dazzle of the ""Mein Herr"" or ""Money, Money"" numbers from ""Cabaret,"" there are still a fair share of showstoppers in ""Jazz,"" notably a cute little duet for Reinking and the girl that plays Gideon's daughter, and the rousing opening number, in which a stage full of Broadway hopefuls audition for a show in a whirl of quick edits set to the song ""On Broadway."" A fantastic, mesmerizing film.Grade: A",All That Jazz
16,zetes,"Self-congratulatory, but, without a doubt, brilliant",9,13 December 2002,"A brilliant movie from a brilliant artist, and you'll be reminded of that constantly as you sit through All That Jazz, both in positive and negative ways. This, Fosse's fourth and also penultimate film, is his version of 8½. But the great success of Fellini's semi-autobiographical masterpiece, easily one of the five or ten best films ever made, is that its author depicts himself with the greatest humility. And not only great humility but, most importantly, honest humility (or at least believable humility). Fellini's constant self-deprecation felt like honest self-criticism, and it felt as if he was truly exposing his inner self to his audience. In All That Jazz, Fosse tries to do the same, but the self-deprecation comes off almost as back-patting. Fosse presents his alter ego, Joe Gideon (well played by Roy Scheider), as a lovable cad. Oh, he might bang every chick in sight, but it's very much applauded.I can complain about these more arrogant aspects of All That Jazz, but what is undeniable is how great a filmmaker Fosse really is. It may be extremely self-congratulatory, but, judging from this film itself and its three predecessors, it can be argued that Fosse deserved the adulation that he supplies himself. As a fan, I loved the way he incorporates semi-fictionalized versions of his previous films into this one. 1974's Lenny plays a major part, as Gideon is going through the process of editing his new film The Stand-Up throughout the film. He brings his daughter to its premier, and, it being her first R-rated movie, she thanks her dad and then asks him why that guy wanted to sleep with two women at the same time. The reference to Cabaret is less pronounced but clear, when, stemming off from the daughter's question about threesomes, Gideon flashes back briefly to himself recreating the ""Two Ladies"" number. This number, of course, was famously created for the film version of Cabaret by Fosse. I'm not 100% sure if there is a reference to Sweet Charity (which would make sense, since it bombed horribly and almost ruined Fosse's filmmaking career), but the musical number with Gideon's girlfriend and daughter begins sort of like the ""If They Could See Me Now"" number, with Shirley MacLaine in Ricardo Montelbahn's bedroom.The musical numbers are something to behold. I think this is a given in a Bob Fosse film, but every single one is breathtaking. The sexy rehearsal number, which leads into the even sexier ""Airplane"" number, would be pilfered by singer/choreographer Paula Abdul in her video ""Cold Hearted Snake."" More silly trivia, John Lithgow was so goofy looking in his relative youth, that guy who was the captain of the Love Boat and also the dad in ALF has an important part, and Wallace Shawn, of Manhattan, My Dinner with André and The Princess Bride fame appears in the most poorly calculated scene in the movie (Fosse wasn't scrutinizing his film enough if he left it in), has one line, and it is the worst line in the entire film.

19,namashi_1,Scheider Is Masterful in Fosse's Troubled Semi-Autobiographical Fantasy!,6,2 February 2015,"'All That Jazz' is Bob Fosse's ambitious yet ambiguous tale, that shifts from being great to dull. Inconsistent, yet daring, this 1979 Oscar-Winner isn't without its flaws, but it has its own touch, as well. 'All That Jazz' Synopsis: Late/Great Director/Choreographer Bob Fosse tells his own life story as he details the sordid life of Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider), a womanizing, drug-using dancer.'All That Jazz' is beautiful to look at & the choreography of the sizzling dancer numbers are beyond astonishing. But, Fosse's narcissistic Screenplay doesn't shine entirely. The unlikely protagonist's journey, played by Scheider, is affecting at times, but dull otherwise. Also, the writing gets a bit to saddening by the last-hour, which puts you off. Fosse's Direction, however, is superb. He has captured this tale, magnificently well. Cinematography & Editing are strongly done. Art Design is incredible. Make-Up is realistic.Performance-Wise: Its Scheider all the way. The Late/Great Hollywood Starwalt triumphs with a masterful, mesmerizing performance. He enacts Fosse, with the much-needed vulgarity & energy. It's a knock-out performance, without a shed of doubt! Jessica Lange as the angel of death, is first-rate. Leland Palmer as the troubled ex-wife, is highly competent. John Lithgow is simply fantastic in a brief role.On the whole, 'All That Jazz' is ultimately shaky, but Scheider is at the top of his game!",All That Jazz
20,Smells_Like_Cheese,Did I see this or dream it?,6,12 November 2008,"I was going through my mother's movies the other day and I came across All that Jazz, I remember reading in my 1001 movies you must see before you die book, this was mentioned. I had absolutely no idea what it was about, but I noticed that Roy Scheider was in it and he's a fantastic actor, so i figured what did I have to loose? I slipped it in and this is definitely one of the most unique movies I have ever seen. Like I said I had no clue what it was about, so I even watched it twice just to clarify things and still I was just left dumbfounded. The way this film was made is not your typical biography, it does have exciting dance sequences and a lot of trippy scenes. It's strange to say, but it's very dated by the way this film was made. Roy does a knock out performance, not his best, but it makes the film work, but I just don't think this was a film for my tastes.Joe Gideon is a choreographer who is tough, but unique. He always cooks up something good and everyone just adores him, including an endless line of women. Let's put it this way, the line of women he's had an affair with could go around the world twice. We go through his life story, how he came to be who he was. A chain smoking perfectionist who worked non-stop to get ever step and beat down. The critics start to worry that he is loosing his touch, Joe works harder than ever to prove them wrong leading him into a physical break down, but he is determined to put the greatest show on stage.Roy really makes the film worth your watch, so I felt like my time wasn't totally lost. I just couldn't get into this movie. I think it depends on your tastes, it's just made very strangely, which I did understand the direction they were going for to understand Joe's madness, but it just wasn't for me. The whole dream sequences with I think her name was Angelique were just a little off key, I know why she was apart of the story, but it was just a little too strange. I'm not sure if I could recommend this, the only thing I can say is that it is a one of a kind film that you have to be in a certain mood for.6/10",All That Jazz
21,cherold,Bob Fosse's confession,8,15 September 2018,"It is rare for a celebrity director to flay their skin to show you the mess underneath, but that's what Bob Fosse did in All That Jazz. His alter ego Joe is brilliant and self-destructive, successful and riddled with doubt, honest when it will hurt others but unable to fully see himself. He creates great art and lays waste to the lives of those closest to him.It's as though Fosse is saying, ""yes, this is who I am, yes, it's awful, yes, it's gonna kill me, and no, I can't change."" The movie follows Joe as he works on a stage musical while finishing the editing of a movie clearly patterned after Fosse's film Lenny. We repeatedly see a standup routine from the movie that is remarkably unfunny, which is annoying although it's used well towards the film's end. (Trivia: the comedian in that scene is the guy who originated the role of Lenny on stage.)Throughout the movie, Joe flirts with death (in a weirdly literal way) and wreaks havoc. He also choreographs. The early audition scene feels very real, and the first half of the movie feels more like a drama with some musical scenes than a musical, but somewhere along the way Fosse starts throwing terrific numbers at the audience.This is a really weird movie. It's a bit offputting at first, but stick with it.",All That Jazz
22,ElMaruecan82,Bring Me the Soul of Bob Fosse...,9,17 January 2019,"Sam Peckinpah's ""Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia"" was a personal movie Roger Ebert admired for its 'brutal honesty' calling it a ""bizarre masterpiece"". Allow me to steal his line to describe the Golden Palm winner of 1980, an oddity that could only germinate from New Hollywood's imaginative fields and growing on anyone who'd give it a second or a third viewing (one isn't enough).Bob Fosse's ""All That Jazz"" is a personal film and -to put it simply- a love-letter to entertainment from a professional's perspective, not a fan's. The passion of an observer, no matter how accurate, is inevitably undermined by distance. Bob Fosse IS a performer, his love for Broadway isn't Scorsese's ""fascination"" for gangsters or Miyazaki's passion for planes, he loves it as something defining passionately and madly, a part of himself.The film's memorable leitmotif is Vivaldi music playing while an Alka-Seltzer tablet dissolves in a glass, some drops put in green-blue eyes, Dexedrine pills, a shower and then Joe Gideon -Fosse's alter-ego- lifting his palms in front of a mirror and uttering the film's motto: ""It's showtime, folks!"". The ritual is played over and over throughout the film as to show that a talented choreographer can't make good routines without a few bad ones structuring his life.Indeed, Gideon's a chain smoker, drug-addict, sex-addict, workaholic, alcoholic, the price to the commitment to his profession while the outcome is the energy and positive vibes he infuses to his crew and the producers, his fatherly manners and even sex appeal. It's self-destruction for the sake of creation, the tragedy is that creation is inconstant, inspiration fluctuates, but we do witness a decline in health, highlighted in the ""showtime"" interludes.The film follows Gideon, caught between a musical production and the making of a film named ""The Stand-Up"", a nod to Fosse' directing of Lenny Bruce's autobiography (Cliff Gorman who played Lenny in the stage version reprises his role as the comedian) while making a Broadway version of ""Chicago"". So the film isn't implied but meant as a semi-autobiography, which gives an eerily prophetic taste to the decline of Gideon, especially when we know Fosse died eight years after the film, at the age of 60.Like Peckinpah or Hal Ashby, Fosse died in the 80s before any possible comeback leaving us ""Cabaret"" or ""Lenny"", movies that ennobled entertainment, making them drivers, results and comments on their own narratives, the 'Cabaret' burlesque numbers worked like a Greek Chorus, the downfall of Lenny Bruce was punctuated with post-death interviews while his troubles or experiences inspired most of his comedic interventions. In ""All That Jazz"", Gideon's life inspires his acts and his acts affect is, that's the Fossean cycle, we're all our lives' own protagonists.Stage is where Fosse made his bones and it all naturally became the embodiment of life with family, friends, colleagues as players or viewers. Fosse is pushing up to the extreme the notion that there's some spotlight shone on us when we die so even if we lead a so-so life, we can die in a blaze of glory, like a show, a great finale can redeem everything. Maybe Fosse made this great film because he didn't think much of himself.But if we can't evaluate the talent of Gideon, the best tribute to Fosse's talent is Roy Sheider who wasn't a dancer to begin with and only known for a streak of top-notch thriller movies in the 70s. Fosse just gave him his greatest role. And Sheider returned back the favor by giving his best shot as Gideon. Honesty and guts always pay back. And ""All That Jazz"" is so personal it never cheats, so personal it was even deemed as self-indulgent. Yes, there's some reverse narcissism behind self-deprecation but self-indulgent?Fellini was praised for ""8½"" but Fosse goes deeper than all the Oedipal details any viewer could relate too. Fosse undresses his soul, predicting his downfall, only sugarcoating it through a surreal flirting with the Angel of Death, played by Jessica Lange. Even death is portrayed like a beautiful woman, a part of the show. ""All That Jazz"" like Fellini's classic ventures in the improbable world of entertainment metaphysics. As Minnelli said: ""Life is a cabaret"". And yes, we wouldn't be so absorbed by its extravaganza if Fosse wasn't so self-absorbed.But the film isn't all flash and strass, it has moments worthy of comparison with Hollywood classics, the finale and Gideon's health-affecting dedication echoed ""A Star is Born"" and ""42nd Street"" but the beauty of ""All That Jazz"" can be found in 'smaller moments'. I was caught off-guard when Gideon's ex-wife (LeLand Palmer) made that dancing routine in the living room with their daughter and you could see Sheider's genuine emotional reactionFosse was also talented in capturing simple, heart-warming and tender moments, here, a family reunited and a mother just having fun with her daughter. That intimate sequence became an instant favorite just like the ""South American Way"" moment in Woody Allen's ""Radio Days"". Speaking of Allen, there's something oddly Allenian in the film's 'couch approach' to an author's life and relationships with his producers, family, mistresses, doctors, it's also Fellinian in its sensible, empirical emotional exploration. But style-wise, it's all Fosse!The director spits out his soul in the story, culminating his career and the New Hollywood period with a last Hurrah. There would be no musical nominated for Best picture till ""Moulin Rouge!"" (live-action anyway if we consider Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"") Fosse would die in 1987 of heart attack as if exhaustion had finally caught up with him. So, it all comes down to one question: would a true artist trade a few years of his life to make a masterpiece?A fraud would say no, an artist would say yes, a tormented genius might make his death a masterpiece, and ""All That Jazz"" contains perhaps the greatest ""exit"" to any cinematic movie character ever.",All That Jazz
23,secondtake,Has the calling cards of brilliance but deep down it's all flash and dance...which might be enough for some,6,20 July 2010,"All That Jazz (1979)An intense and admired Broadway musical director (played by Roy Scheider) faces death in a huge metaphor layered with dance productions and egomania. Sounds good, and with all the dazzle, it should never get slow, but by some miracle it does. Even the grand final number goes south, getting repetitive as the camera swoops, the films cuts, the dancers writhe, the lights glare. But it sure is visually exciting, and there are some great dances and some great sets, improvised and elaborate both. And Scheider is convincing as an unattractive, drug enhanced, chain smoking middle aged man. The plot whirls with growing inevitability, and the quasi-surreal heaven scenes with Jessica Lange are stiff and ""stagey"" which might be on purpose (it's like Broadway heaven, maybe). What you really have is a patchwork of dance numbers, some hugely talented dancers, and a selfish lead male lacking charm. It's a tough watch if you aren't predisposed to Broadway musicals. The best relationship, between the director and his little daughter, is quite touching in parts, but oddly this is abandoned by the end, and we are left only with mania and ego, in that order.",All That Jazz

25,Nazi_Fighter_David,Fosse's extravagant homage to the musical stage he loved...,9,26 March 2005,"At the end of the seventies, Bob Fosse, director of ""Cabaret,"" created the most strikingand certainly the most controversialoriginal musical film to appear in many years Audacious or intimidating, dazzling or simply bewildering, depending on one's point of view, ""All That Jazz"" was Fosse's extravagant homage to the musical stage he loveda love tempered by wit and ironyand an autobiographical account of one man's hectic travail in the theater, ending with the ultimate experience of his death His Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider), egotistical, selfish, and womanizing, but also guilt-ridden and striving for a perfection he can never achieve, perceives his entire life in terms of show business This obsessive view is his gift, his burden, and his tragic flaw ""All That Jazz"" is the most cinematic musical in a very long time In a style clearly influenced by Italian director Federico Fellini, Fosse uses the camera with brave insurance, moving from naturalistic scenes of frenzied theatrical activity to flights of fantasy, without signaling the audience when the realism ends and the fantasy beginsViewed entirely through Joe Gideon's brilliant, disorderly mind, the world is composed of the important people in his lifehis ex-wife, his present girlfriend, his young daughter, and all the slightly mad, flamboyant show people he works with, as well as figures from his past and future, most especially the ravishing young woman who represents the Angel of Death""All That Jazz"" has some painful moments, and is not easy to follow; it demands the attention that many viewers, irritated by Fosse's self-indulgence, were unwilling to giveSplendidly photographed, ""All That Jazz"" follows Gideon through the exhausting, driving day-to-day routine There are a few quiet momentsin one of the film's best scenes, he gives a private dance lesson to his young daughter Michelle (Erzsebet Foldi) , showing a pride and a tenderness he usually conceals But all of his energy is given to choreographing the movie's most outstanding musical number, ""Take Off with Us."" Brilliantly conceived, the number involves a group of dancers in sensuous choreographed movement ""All That Jazz"" has flaws, but no musical since ""Cabaret"" has worked so assiduously to weld all the elements of a musical film into a single entity that could only be done on the screen: a personal statement that could be dismissed or even mocked but that could not be ignored",All That Jazz
26,dwpollar,Dark comedic musical...,7,25 August 2014,"1st watched 8/23/2014 -- 7 out of 10(Dir-Bob Fosse): Dark comedic musical about the downfall of a Broadway musical director written and directed by Bob Fosse is very well done for the most part. Roy Scheider plays the overworked, overmedicated, playboy director who just refuses to give less of himself to his work and his body can't deal with it. This is advertised as a musical, but it's more a portrayal of a man who really has no direction to go but down because of his refusal to change his way of life. He admits to his faults but just doesn't deal with it. He cheated on his ex-wife, doesn't give enough time to his daughter, cheats on his current girlfriend, and is majorly obsessed to giving everything to his work to these faults. This movie does exactly what it wants to do almost perfectly. The only flaw, in my opinion, is an overlong slightly corny ending number. Fosse choreographs the dancing numbers -- which there are plenty of -- but they complement the story rather than just being an addition. The beautiful Jessica Lange portrays death and is used throughout to help show what's going on inside Scheider's character and introduces the inevitable very early on. The movie could be considered depressing but it's all done tongue-in-cheek(almost laughing at itself because of the choice of the subject matter). The two hours fly by because of the way the director presents the main character and gets your interest in his life. Pieces are revealed as the story moves forward and by the end you get a complete picture of the man's life. This movie is so much more than a musical even though these parts aren't bad either --- it should be held in acclaim as one of the better of it's kind -- don't miss this one.",All That Jazz
27,drownnnsoda,An affirmation of life,10,19 December 2020,"A self-reflexive, semi-autobiographical reflection on choreographer/director Bob Fosse's own life and career, ""All That Jazz"" follows middle-aged Broadway and film director Joe Gideon, who attempts to juggle a new stage production, the editing of a feature film, and his relationships with his daughter, ex-wife, and girlfriend, all amidst his own ailing health after years of excess.It's a common sentiment that, though a lush and at times upbeat quasi-musical, ""All That Jazz"" is ultimately a depressing film. While this is an understandable position, I would argue the exact opposite: that it is really an affirmation of life in its purest form. What makes ""All That Jazz"" so unique is Fosse's storytelling mode, which blends hyper-editing and insightful vignettes from Joe's life, with musical numbers interspersed at varying moments for heightened effect. The storytelling is unconscious and plays out through suggestion; this is not to say that there is no linearity, because there is, but the back-and-forth between objective moments in Joe's life and the dramatized, stylized musical sequences ultimately renders a kaleidoscopic view of him, really getting to the heart of the character.The musical numbers themselves are, unsurprisingly, extraordinarily designed and a pure joy to watch. Roy Scheider turns in a career-defining performance as Joe, while Ann Reinking and Leland Palmer--playing Joe's girlfriend and ex-wife, respectively--offer poignant performances in addition to impressive footwork. Jessica Lange also appears as Angelique, an ""angel of death"" manifestation whom Joe occasionally commiserates with throughout the course of the film.While the lyrics to the film's climactic musical number are almost head-scratchingly macabre on paper, ""All That Jazz"" nevertheless proves itself as a heartfelt celebration of life, death, art, and love--and it has enough emotional intelligence to know that none of those things can exist without the other. As someone who tends to dislike musicals as a rule, this is one of my favorite movies--a rare cinematic tapestry that transcends genre. 10/10.",All That Jazz
28,alansabljakovic-39044,Chess with death,8,21 March 2020,I'm not the biggest fan of musicals but this movie is a great character study and explores existential questions in such unique way.

29,EUyeshima,Unmistakably Fosse With Strokes Both Self-Indulgent and Brilliant,7,18 July 2006,"With the kinetic edits capturing fully the energy of a Broadway cattle call and punctuated perfectly by George Benson's jazzy version of ""On Broadway"", the opening sequence of Bob Fosse's 1979 autobiographical musical extravaganza is so dazzling that the rest of the movie feels like a series of climaxes awaiting the big finish...literally. Fosse, who also co-wrote the script with Robert Alan Arthur, encapsulates his own hectic life into a patently self-indulgent movie with unmistakable style and verve and isolated moments of sheer brilliance. His doppelganger is Joe Gideon, who is juggling a major Hollywood film about a stand-up comic (like ""Lenny"") and a major Broadway production starring his ex-wife (like ""Chicago""), while simultaneously dealing with his failing heart and a splintered domestic life. A demanding perfectionist, Gideon drives himself with unbounded energy, a heavy smoking habit and an excess of medications. This leads him to the hospital where he faces a personal abyss monitored by the Angel of Death, here a diaphanous woman named Angelique. Gideon's pending mortality starts to take on the stamp of his own productions until reality and fantasy become indistinguishable.As anyone who has seen ""8 1/2"" knows, Fosse's film has a Felliniesque aura about it, but the dancer/director/choreographer brings his own unmistakable brand to the film with his rhythmic pacing, unique choreography and show biz savvy. It's a blend that sometimes works quite well, for example, in the erotically charged ""Take Off With Us"" number and the sweet pas de deux between Ann Reinking and Erzsebet Foldi on Peter Allen's ""Everything Old Is New Again"". Yet, at other times, Fosse comes across as narcissistic and self-serving, especially during the extensive death sequence set to the Everly Brothers' ""Bye Bye Love"". Luckily, Fosse cast Roy Scheider as Gideon, a smart move given the actor's innate lack of vanity makes the character's self-absorption more tolerable. It's a smart performance well turned and not overly excessive given the opportunity. The rest of the cast is serviceable though little more - Broadway veteran Leland Palmer as Gideon's ex-wife Audrey, obviously modeled after the legendary Gwen Verdon; Reinking playing a variation of herself as girlfriend Kate; and Jessica Lange, just after the ""King Kong"" fiasco, most alluring as Angelique. The 2003 DVD is fairly modest on extras - scene-specific commentary from Scheider, brief interview snippets with Scheider, and very brief vintage footage of Fosse directing the cattle call sequence.",All That Jazz
30,TOMNEL,Bob Fosse's delightfully odd tribute to himself.,8,7 May 2007,"Stars: Roy Scheider, Jessica Lange, Ann Reinking, Ben Vereen, Cliff Gorman, John Lithgow.Bob Fosse has created a fun, lively and downright good musical and movie, that's pretty much about him. Joe Gideon (Scheider) is a play director and choreographer, along with being a womanizer, drinker and drug user. At times, he has conversations with a fictional woman Angelique (Lange), who resembles a sort of angel. When Joe has a heart attack, he learns that his ways have caught up with him. The musical numbers in this are so strange, yet strangely fantastic. About 5 of the musical numbers are hallucinations of Joe's when he's in the hospital. Bob Fosse obviously based Joe on himself, and based this on how he figured his life would turn out, and sadly he was correct. ""All That Jazz"" is consistently brilliant, but the way the end was done just blew me away. A bouncy and happy musical hallucination about death, all leading to Mr. Gideon finally meeting Angelique head on, and then the final scene, which in it's own way was amazingly powerful. This is definitely not for everyone, but all should at least enjoy it for it's amazing direction, choreography and of course, music.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 121 mins. Rated R for some gory violence, nudity and language.",All That Jazz
31,rosscinema,Dazzling self portrait,7,4 July 2003,"As I watched this film it dawned on me that Bob Fosse probably made this film as part of exorcising his own demons. Story is for the most part about Bob Fosse but he calls himself Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider) and the film starts with the auditions for ""Chicago"" and during this he is also editing a feature film about a stand-up comic so we see that he is a workaholic. He also chain smokes, sleeps with various women and neglects his daughter Michelle (Erzsebet Foldi). Everything around him is causing tremendous stress to his already fatigued body and in his imagination he flirts with an angel of death named Angelique (Jessica Lange). Gideon's condition gets worse and he checks himself out at the hospital and he learns that he has two clogged arteries and needs heart surgery. The backers for the broadway show must now decide if they should delay the opening or replace Gideon as the director. The film shows Gideon reflecting back on his life and the decisions he has made and how he feels about his own fate. Fosse cast Roy Scheider as Gideon and Scheider pulls it off pretty well. I'm not sure if he did his own singing or not but Scheider does possess a lean athletic body that was needed to make us believe he's a dancer. You have to give him credit for doing such a remarkable job in a role that most would not have cast him in. *****SPOILER ALERT***** I found it interesting that Fosse had the character Gideon die at the end of the film but I think Fosse was trying to make amends with his own past. Its as if Fosse used this film as a way of changing and letting everyone know that he's a changed man. The old Fosse is dead and the new Fosse has moved forward. Lange was reportedly dating Fosse at this point and thats why she was cast in the film but it turned out to be an important role for her. She garnered good reviews and it helped some people forget the wretched ""King Kong"" debacle. Some familiar faces show up in this film like Max Wright, Michael Tolan, Keith Gordon, John Lithgow, Sandahl Bergman, CCH Pounder, Vicky Frederick and Wallace Shawn. Film is self indulgent but so was Fosse. He was an artist and his whole life was in the theater so one would expect this autobiographical view of him to be a little over the top. I never found it dull and I think its a fascinating look at a very talented and unique person.",All That Jazz
32,Matt_Layden,Dark & Depressing Musical,6,3 September 2007,"The film All That Jazz, details the life of Joe Gideon, who is based on Bob Fosse, who ironically wrote and directed the film.The film uses flashbacks to create depth for the characters. For instance, Joe Gideon has a vision of a beautiful woman all in white; this is the Angel of Death, he is dying. While talking to this Angel, he has a vision of his childhood, when he grew up in the Burlesque house. This scene allows the viewer to see what kind of kid Joe was and how he became the man he is today.Sound is very important to this film, it's all about music and dance. One scene in particular is when the script scene appears. All the surrounding sounds were taken out and it focused on his breathing, knuckles cracking and everything else he was doing, everything else was muted.All That Jazz is a dark and depressing film that deals with drugs, sex, and death. These are controversial elements to add to a musical. The lighting used enhances the sexual elements in the film, especially in the dance number in which all the dancers dance in the dark, but the spotlight hits a few. These dancers begin taking their clothes off and everything becomes sexual, which upsets everyone.The final dance number is a vision that Joe has on his deathbed; once again the dancers wear all white, which symbolizes angels. Joe has made many mistakes in his life and in this scene he asks for forgiveness. All his friends and family are in the crowd or dance number.This film is still influential today, with quick editing and montages such as: Joe taking a shower, taking pills and taking eye drops. All of those are seen in the recent film Requiem for a Dream. All That Jazz is a different take on the musical that tries to go for controversy rather then a cheerful jolly ending that most conventional musicals do and this film should be applauded for doing so.",All That Jazz

The marketing hype for the film proclaimed it a ""masterwork"" and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences lavished Oscars on it, but it is painful to watch as it exposes the backstage struggles of countless music wannabes who mask their disappointments with smiles and drugs. Memorable numbers: ""On Broadway,"" ""Everything Old Is New Again."" But this is not so much a musical as a cynical, often surreal drama about the narcissistic people who make musical theater.

Roy Scheider gives an extraordinary and iconic performance, one of which is slips into character so much - I forget it's a performance but a human being. It's quite possibly my all-time favourite. The technical competence and flashiness of it all is stunning and ironic as they are as elaborate as they would be if Joe Gideon himself were directing it (especially the frantic editing) which comes as a reflection of Bob Fosse himself. The musical doesn't kick in until the third act in which it sinks in comfortably and for a plausible reason. The fantastic finale is my favourite scene of all-time. This film really does keep me happy despite the depression. I suppose I find it inspirational in a way. Joe Gideon is everything I wanna be but nothing I wanna be like.10/10",All That Jazz

I just saw it again, and my goodness, I enjoyed it ten times more this time around! This is not a true biography of the movie's director, (Bob Fosse) but a fictionalized account of a overworked Broadway and movie Director named Gideon(!!). He is played here by Roy Scheider in one hell of a performance. Who knew that he had such range! Singing, Dancing, you name it! He's putting on his new musical and in the finishing stages of editing his new movie. Day by day, you can see the stress pile on to him. Plus, it doesn't help that he's a chain smoker..Fosse edits this movie brilliantly, using the Gideon character in the current time, and also using Gideon reflecting on his life, while talking to a character, played by Jessica Lange (whose character I won't reveal, so not to spoil it for you (but if you were paying attention, you'll easily pick it up).What can I say? This has the best choreographed scene I've seen in a long time. The Airotica number is so well done, choreographed and edited that it simply took my breath away. Of course, this theme was the inspiration for the ending of Flashdance and Paula Abdul's 'Cold Hearted' video. Nice to see the original.And the ending, my god.

I was in High School at the time ""All That Jazz"" came out, I sat through this film and the only part I liked was ""the guy on the bed watching his life pass by his eyes as a choreographed dance number."" But I had no idea why.Years pass, and when I thought of ""All That Jazz"", all I could think about was a little girl on a white hearst singing to her dad in a dream sequence to stop messing himself up and live for her. I really wanted to see this film again. There was something I wasn't getting. Finally in 1990, I go out and buy this film. I absolutely had a different view and I absolutely loved it. Why? Because by that time I had found out WHO Bob Fosse was and realized what he did was something very hard in the Hollywood Industry, he gave you a film about his life that he directed and choreographed ---before he died!A Premonition? A Prediction? A Re-Call from his heart attack?Now, it seems like common place for folks who never knew the person to run out and do films of famous people and their lives after they're cold, cold in the ground to object.Here, Fosse actually did a film squarely about HIS life, told to you...by him. Not only that, he went to those in his industry to help him! Dancers he worked with, and in sme cases made stars out of them  and even lovers he had. If you're not aware of this, this film may seem kinda dull and trite to you. It did to me, but now that I know, it's a brillant peice and a card Fosse left behind so that there would be little mistake for folks to know somewhat more deeper (not too exactly but close enough) about him.Fosse takes the time in his life that when all his demons and his dance with death came to head...Directing and Editing the motion picture ""Lenny"" and at the same time staging and Directing ""Chicago"". Yes, he was a driven workhorse, but he was also a womanizing slime bucket, an adultrer,  at times a clearly negligent father and all the while always with his little secret crush on ""the angel of death"". This was Fosse's vision of how he thought he would leave the earth, this is his telling to you of how he was...and in my view, it was brilliant in its timing of such-- in its film release and in it's telling.Brilliant film by a brilliant...and very flawed genius.",All That Jazz
37,Jeremy_Urquhart,A masterpiece to triumphantly end the 1970s- perhaps the best decade in film history,10,9 October 2020,"It's taken me seven years and three viewings to realise that this might be the best movie of all time.
In 2013: solid 4/5.
2017: bumped it to a 4.5/5.
Now in 2020: easy 5/5.It has the best editing and best ending out of probably any movie I've ever seen.
Roy Scheider's performance is one of the all time greats. The supporting cast are all wonderful too, with so many great actors in relatively minor- yet well performed- roles (Jessica Lange! John Lithgow! CCH Pounder! Wallace Shawn!)
Every single music number is choreographed and shot to perfection.
Overall, the two-hour runtime absolutely flies by, because the pacing is almost perfect.I also didn't realise how funny this movie was before, and by and large, the comedy doesn't distract from how intense and sad the movie can also be. In fact, it's one of those rare instances where the lighter moments just make the heavier moments hit even harder.Speaking of emotions: holy hell, the last 15 minutes or so are out of this world amazing. The ending to this film is funny, heartwarming, depressing, kinda creepy, and groovy + energetic, all at once. It is an absolutely perfect ending, and even without such a great ending, this movie feels essentially perfect.I couldn't recommend this film highly enough. Stanley Kubrick was right: this really is one of the greatest films of all time.",All That Jazz
38,sharky_55,To be on the wire is life. The rest is waiting.,8,26 April 2018,"Editing is the life and breath of All That Jazz, the glue that binds every hazy strand of director choreographer Joe Gideon's life together. Sweet Charity had already demonstrated Fosse's prowess in syncing movement with sound - that's just basic choreography. Here he injects rhythm with the cuts themselves, condensing an afternoon of initial dance rehearsals into a montage bursting with vitality and colour. The dancer's movements are spliced and rearranged into a single cohesive unit - graphic matches merge their individual pirouette into one multicoloured blur, like a spinning top. They drag their feet to the sultry beat of George Benson's On Broadway, and leap into the air in perfect sync. The experience is a complete performance on its own, and already Joe has his eyes on a select few (and not just purely for their dancing). For him the only ritual more steadfast and constant is in his morning sacrament, a Dexedrine, AlkaSeltzer, and copious eyedrops, all enlarged in grotesque extreme close-ups. Is playing Vivaldi over it all an attempt to convince himself of some semblance of serenity? If so, it's an uphill battle. This daily intravenous drip allows him the zest to commit to several different creative projects at once, a string of women and a thick smog of chain-smoking, and then to do it all again the next day. Joe is a true artist in the sense that he is a perfectionist in his work, and a hurricane's wake in his private life. This being showbiz, the two often intermingle in an incestuous embrace, with dance as the sole bridge for conversation. That may be the only way to get his attention, as all three of ex-wife, girlfriend and daughter discover. Joe may have giddy tears in his eyes as the latter performs an impromptu rendition of Peter Allen's Everything Old Is New Again, but the acerbic cut to his morning routine suggests an unchanged man.Why does he throw himself into these projects, even at death's door? Some contemporary critics note the flaw of his impenetrable character; Joe's motivation remains ever-obscured behind a haze of drugs, sex and musical numbers, with hardly a moment devoted to why. Why? The show is his life, and his life is a show, forever destined to contest for centre stage. They can chastise his lack of devotion or loyalty all they want - it isn't something he doesn't already know anyway - as long as it's done in costume, and in time. Fosse's choreography suffers none from this maddened attentiveness; his bodies stuttering from movement to a frozen strut, limbs cocked at odd angles and splayed across each other. It's sexy and suave all at once, and none too pleasing for the anxious financial backers sitting in the test audience. ""Now Sinatra will never record it,"" they moan as the dancers bare their chests (and see how Fosse splices together their yawns in the opening rehearsal). Joe is loyal only to Angelique, an angel of death played by the glittery Jessica Lange. Their tango takes place in an imaginary set decorated with both past and present relics of his life, costumes once worn and now discarded. She's his witty equal, an angelic figment of the imagination that is at his every beck and call - no other girl could suffice, or put up with his constant professional negligence. His daughter Michelle gives it her best shot, although her presence is one of the film's glaring oversights, a chatty, flippant teenager who only fits within this frenetic, showbiz lifestyle because Fosse pipes in her wit through poorly dubbed ADR. Watching her tease Joe on the free-flowing sexuality of one of his numbers is like witnessing a comedic skit of an entirely different film.Only in his daydreams do these dances attain his final seal of approval. While the business executives are busy musing over the potential financial gain of his early demise (bluntly overlaid graphic images of his dissection), he's hard at work stage-managing procession. It's usually here that detractors bemoan Fosse's excess, the self-indulgence of an artist who can't even bow out without a blasting fanfare and at least three elaborate set pieces. In some ways, they're not wrong (I like my dream sequences fleeting and with a devastating gut punch, like the finale of Claire Denis' Beau Travail). And yet, why would Gideon/Fosse ever want to hold back? A little heart attack never hurt anyone, not when there is dancing and directing to be done. It's showtime, and the show must go on.",All That Jazz
39,tim-764-291856,A Dark Indulgence,8,24 November 2010,"I understand that 'All That Jazz' was Bob Fosse's tribute to himself, rather like Fellini's 8 and a half was to him. Whilst this inevitably results in touches of self absorption, pity and narcissism, Mr Fosse has given us some of the greatest and most admired musical films, ever, where he combined human tragedy with artistic spectacle and the sense of really getting the most from his stars. The star in this is the choreography and its interpretation. Running alongside and crossing between outer body experience and real life but that line being somewhat blurred, Roy Scheider is always at loggerheads between his artistic and excess-all-areas lifestyle, with the results thereof introducing themselves in various forms. The censors, producers, doctors, lovers, cast members and cigarettes all have a big role in his daily battles, but at the end of the day, we are all immortal and are just a body with a brain in its skull. Don't let me put you off...it's largely entertaining, hugely at times but never too dark or morose. Just don't expect all sweetness and light with joyous numbers.It's Cabaret without Liza Minnelli, but with a somewhat bitter genius who doesn't sing, or dance. Enjoyed the former? Then you'll get a lot from 'All That Jazz'.",All That Jazz
40,TOMASBBloodhound,A self-indictment.,9,24 May 2006,"All that Jazz is a great film that almost seems to have dropped off the radar screen of classic musicals. The film gives us the account of a choreographer named Joe Gideon (Scheider) whose relentless way of living drives him straight into the grave. The character is based on the real life of director Bob Fosse who suffered the same fate in 1987. Gideon is a womanizing, drug abusing, perfectionist who begins each morning with the same routine. He pops a few pills, takes some Alka-Seltzer, jumps in the shower (sometimes with a cigarette in his mouth!), and declares it's ""showtime"" after giving himself one last look in the mirror. When we meet him, he's currently putting the finishing touches on a film he's just directed, and he's beginning work on a new Broadway musical. The man looks absolutely exhausted. He's always smoking. He seems on the brink of collapse from angina, and he frequently grasps his left arm apparently in an effort to determine if his heart is still beating or not.The main idea behind this film is that Gideon knows he's dying. The life he has lived has assured him only a brief stay on this earth. As the film plays out, we see how Gideon comes to grips with his impending fate. His final journey is often touching; sometimes joyful. But above all, it is compelling and once it's over, you'll probably wish Gideon had hung on longer. He seemed to have so much to live for. Even the people around him who he's hurt in life (his ex-wife and current girlfriend, for example) still are a big part of his life. He has a wonderful daughter who he's just getting to know, as well. Without him around, there would certainly be an enormous void left for all of the central characters in this film. We see him confess his life's sins to Jessica Lange who plays an angel waiting to usher him into the afterlife once he finally succumbs to his medical problems. The closer the two of them get, the closer he is to the grave.Fosse's direction is exceptional. His musical numbers (particularly Airotica) are top-drawer as you'd expect them to be. And he's never afraid to shock you with his camera-work. At one point we get an up-close and personal look at Gideon's heart surgery, and that's a bit grotesque for a musical. Remember this is the same director that showed us Dorothy Stratton's face getting blown off with a shotgun in Star 80.Fosse also understandably knows these characters better that they know themselves. By the end of the film, you really know Joe Gideon, and you feel like you've lived part of his life. Fosse saw the same fate coming to himself, and indeed it found him in 1987. We often wish exceptional individuals would stick around longer, but then again it's the way they live that makes them so exceptional.This film is highly recommended. 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.",All That Jazz
41,bankofmarquis,Full blown Fosse (and that's a good thing),9,1 October 2020,"After THE FRENCH CONNECTION, JAWS, MARATHON MAN and SORCERER (and, if I'm honest, JAWS II), my brother and I thought Roy Scheider was just about the toughest son-of-a-gun on the planet, so when he asked if I wanted to check out the latest ""Roy Scheider flick"", I jumped at the chance.Little did either of us know that it was the semi-autobiographical Bob Fosse gem ALL THAT JAZZ. Me, being a musical theater kid, was thrilled by this unexpected spectacle while my brother (who would rather sit through C-Span than watch a musical) calls it, to this day, his ""favorite"" musical (granted, not a long list).I've rewatched this film various times over the years and still liked it, but I hadn't checked it out for over 20 years at this point, so it was with some trepidation that I popped my DVD in (yes, I own the DVD, not the Blu-Ray) and sat back to see how well it holds up.And...I shouldn't have worried, for it holds up very, very well. Not only as a film, not only as a musical, not only as a look into the life and times (and style) of Bob Fosse, but also as a looking glass into the late 1970's.Written and Directed by famed Director/Choreographer Bob Fosse (CABARET, CHICAGO), ALL THAT JAZZ tells the (much more than) semi-autobiographical story of famed Director/Choreographer Joe Gideon (Scheider) who is pushing himself hard to finish a film and mount a Broadway show relying on booze, drugs and philandering.The performances are strong in this film with a bevy of ""Fosse regulars"" strutting their stuff. From Leland Palmer (in the obvious Gwen Verdon role) to Ann Reinking (in the Ann Reinking role) to Ben Vereen (as the variety show headliner from hell) they all bring strong Broadway credentials to the screen making the musical numbers a veritable showcase of Fosse movements.A very young Jessica Lange (in an early role that would showcase her acting chops) is mesmerizing, haunting and very, very watchable as a mysterious women in Joe's life while a very young John Lithgow shows up (and chews the scenery very, very well) as a rival director.The surprise to me, of course, was the strong performance of Scheider in the lead role. He was Oscar-nominated for his work (deservingly so) and when he finally steps into the big finale musical number, he shows that he can hold his own (surprisingly so). He is PERFECTLY cast as Joe Gideon and he never really approached this strong work again in his career.But, make no mistake about it, this film showcases Bob Fosse's Directing and Choreography skills - and they are excellent. The style of the film - bouncing from real life to something more ethereal - is strong, and strongly Fosse, giving a clear idea of the life and time in which these events unfold. I stated earlier that this film is a ""looking glass"" into the late 1970's, and I meant it. It immediately brought me back to those times - both the good and bad of it.The musical numbers are fascinating to watch with the dancing particularly stunning as the angles and forms that the dancers make with their bodies and arms and legs are a wonder to behold. There has never been anyone like Fosse (before or since) and it is GREAT to watch a showcase of his talents.This film was nominated for 9 Oscars - winning 4 - but losing Picture, Director (Fosse) and Actor (Scheider) to KRAMER vs. KRAMER (Picture, Director - Robert Benton and Actor - Dustin Hoffman). Now, I haven't seen Kramer vs. Kramer in a long, long time (probably not since I saw it in the theaters in 1979), but I gotta think ALL THAT JAZZ is better in all those categories.If you haven't seen this in awhile - or if you have NEVER seen it - check out ALL THAT JAZZ, you'll be glad you did.Letter Grade: A9 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",All That Jazz
42,itamarscomix,A self-portrait in musical form,9,23 September 2011,"Fascinating - if a bit messy - and all too often overlooked, to label All That Jazz as a remake of 8 1/2 would be completely missing the point, and missing out on a wonderful movie. Although they're both surreal films with an autobiographical basis, they're also very different. All That Jazz was an integral part of the artistic revolution in Hollywood in the 70's and it was way ahead of its time for American cinema; and even if a lot of it seems indulgent and uneven, it holds its own shockingly well thirty years later. Unlike a lot of bio-pics which hold interest only for those interested in the subject, All That Jazz holds a profound and bleak statement about show-business, success, humanity and morality, all told through Bob Fosse's own experiences. Fantastic musical numbers as only Fosse could make make sure that it's entertaining, breaking up the constant darkness and depression and makes it a great film experience.",All That Jazz
43,Isaac5855,Fosse's Bold and Scathing Self-Examination of his own life...,9,1 December 2005,"1979's ALL THAT JAZZ is definitely one of my favorite films, a permanent part of video collection and a film I can watch over and over again without tiring of it. This dark, twisted, self-indulgent, musical version of Fellini's 8 1/2 seems to be Fosse's exploration of his own personal demons as he lays his life out there for all to see in a not too flattering light as a career-driven, hard drinking, smoking, womanizing director/choreographer who is alive when he's on a Broadway stage creating dances or behind a camera lens but is clueless on how to deal with regular life and the little imperfections that most regular folks are able to cope with and accept. Roy Scheider delivers a brilliant performance as the Fosse alter-ego Joe Gideon, who is trying to stage a new Broadway musical and put the finishing touches on a movie he directed and the stress of all this work puts him in the hospital after a heart attack. This story was based on the period in Fosse's career when he was beginning to mount the musical CHICAGO for Gwen Verdon and was still editing his 1974 film LENNY with Dustin Hoffman and had a heart attack shortly afterwards. This film sucks you in from the beginning with shots of dancers warming up onstage as the opening bars of George Benson's ""On Broadway"" begin to fill the audio. Soon the camera pulls back to reveal hundreds of dancers onstage as Gideon weeds out the dancers he wants to cast in ""NY to LA"", the fictionalized version of CHICAGO. This number is just brilliant and is a wonderful introduction into the world of NY theater auditions for the uninitiated. Fosse, is, more than anything, a choreographer, and his dance direction in this film is nothing short of astonishing. I can watch the ""Take Off With Us/Air-Rotica"" scene over and over again and never tire of it. I also enjoyed when Ann Reinking (as Joe's girlfriend, basically playing herself) and Erzsebet Foldi (playing Joe's daughter, Michelle (Nicole))do a dance for Joe to Peter Allen's ""Everything Old is New Again"" in his living room. Joe's fantasy production numbers after he enters the hospital are also dazzling, especially long-legged Reinking's rendition of ""You Better Change your Ways"". There are also small quiet moments in the film that are equally effective, in particular a lovely scene in a dance studio with Joe and his daughter where she tries to talk him into getting married and giving her a little brother. This is not a side of Gideon we see much of (Fosse either) and it is a lovely moment. Jessica Lange's ethereal quality was used to great advantage in her small but showy role as Joe's Angel of Death. Leland Palmer (who starred in Fosse's PIPPIN on Broadway) registers as Audrey Paris, Joe's ex-wife and Michelle's mother, a fictionalized Gwen Verdon. Her scene with Scheider in the dance studio where she calls him on his constant infidelity is a gem. Cliff Gorman scores as Davis Newman, the star of Joe's film, THE STAND UP (this film's version of LENNY), who is seen visiting Gideon in the hospital and psychoanalyzing him at the same time. The ""Bye Bye Love"" finale is a little over the top and WAY too long but I like the end of it when he says goodbye to everyone before his death (especially loved the looks exchanged with John Lithgow and his hug with daughter Michelle). All in all, ALL THAT JAZZ is a must for Fosse-ites and fans of musical theater..whether it's stage or screen. Not as good as CABARET, but still a unique movie experience to be savored.",All That Jazz

Roy Schieder plays Joe Gideon, a heavy boozing/womanizer/pill-popping choreographer/director, putting together a play and editing a movie at the same time. He is also a sad excuse for a human being, creating misery for those around him (An absentee father and making life miserable for the women in his life). Plus he seems to have these interesting philosophical conversations with Angelique (The beautifully haunting Jessica Lange. His wild and wicked ways come to a head when his boozing, pill-popping and chain smoking ways cause him to have a heart attack. Despite this, he continues his seemingly self-destructive behavior. This is an incredible film dealing with life and death, in a musical manner. Bob Fosse directs this film with an interesting flair, and some of the musical scenes are very interesting (Especially the finale, in which he sings ""Bye Bye Love"" with Ben Vereen, as the people in his life are sitting in the audience.)

The film has a lot of sequences that are remarkably put together, and it's also got a lot of plain outright stupidity. I'm less interested in what the film has to say about Fosse than in what the fact that he made it has to say about him.

Two hours of self-regard masquerading as self-loathing, of egomania as a substitute for content. It's not the cast's fault, nor the crew. It's all down to Fosse.

52,Okonh0wp,2 1/2 Stars (out of 4),5,8 June 2004,"All That Jazz is a biopic that reminds me of the recent Oscar winner Chicago in that the main character is so passionate about show business that the line between reality and the stage become blurred. Chicago, I really did enjoy watching because it took this idea and went with it full-force mixing melodramatic scenes with musical song-and-dance numbers, where as All That Jazz didn't really go full-force in any direction and ended up in an awkward middle ground. Centering on Broadway dancer Joseph Gideon, played by Roy Scheider, the film relies on a couple recurring motifs and chronological disorder in its storytelling to convey its effects. One of the motifs is that Scheider starts out every day taking some kind of prescribed drug, drinking a cup of water with alka-seltzer, putting eye drops in his eyes and smiling in front of a mirror exclaiming to himself, 'It's Showtime', which just has the overall effect of making him appear distanced from reality.The other big motif is that there's a certain blur of events time wise, especially when there are frequent interruptions in the story in which Gideon is talking to a pretty attractive woman, Jessica Lange, who happens to be the Angel of Death, so that makes the film a sort of surreal flashback. The whole thing left me more confused than anything else, and also by the time I figured out who she was, the story's protagonist was in the hospital and it was unclear whether he would survive, so I felt like the answer to that question was ruined.I really liked the opening musical number as a crowd starts out on a Broadway stage trying out for a show while the song 'On Broadway' is playing and one-by-one Gideon sends them home until he whittles it down to the cast we'll become more familiar with over the course of the film. It really has an interesting vibe to it as are some of the behind-the-scenes aspects of Broadway we see in this film, but they didn't show too much of that.When I really think hard about why this film didn't cut it for me, it points to the fact that despite Scheider's efforts, Joseph Gideon, and I don't even know if he's an actual real-life person, just isn't anyone interesting enough to make a biopic about. The gist of the man's life was that he was very talented and genuinely cared about those who loved him, but he also couldn't stay loyal to any one woman and slept around, even while he was married. Well, I'm sorry, talented and womanizer is nothing new. Judging from all the scandals and divorces going on in Hollywood. In fact, you'd probably find it harder to find a talented performer who IS loyal to his wife.",All That Jazz
53,jackasstrange,One of the best musicals out there without a shadow of doubt.,9,18 November 2013,"All That Jazz is a fantastic film. It's cinematography, acting, and script are almost flawless. I always thought how would be a film that mixed the existentialism of Ingmar Bergman and the fantastic and surreal of Fellini, and perhaps this one would be perfect for those who are fan of both directors, or expanding the subject, of both the entire 'existentialist' and 'surreal' sub genres. And in fact, this film's structure is often compared to Federico Fellini's 8½, another thinly-veiled autobiographical film with fantastical elements.Again, this is perhaps one of the best musical films that i've seen so far. The choreography is dawn good, there's really a lot of effort put in it. The numbers are really great as well, specifically the last one. The acting by Roy Scheider is without a doubt great. He brings to the screen the perfect image of a baroque mix of the disturbed and egocentric man. The editing is also perfect. The sequence which repeats multiple times in the film, where Joe is awaking up, going to shower, taking his pills and playing the music is priceless.The art design is good as well. I sometimes thought that i was myself into a Peter Greenaway film, due to the familiar and similar use of colors to turn the ambient and the atmosphere into a weird and beautiful one at the same time.So, what else can i say about this film?

""All That Jazz"" is besides, one of the most bitter musicals (With ""Pink Floyd The Wall"" and ""Dancer in the Dark"") that i have ever seen. But this one gives you an entertaining and noisy view of the life of an artist. Then, is silence ...The story is a perfect portrait of Bob Fosse's life and his thoughts about life, family, childhood, music, money, women, sex, believes, cigarettes and of course ... show business. The movie told us the story of Joe Gideon, a very knew artist in show business. But he has an illness. Now he look to present, to past and to future. Angelique is waiting him ... Roy Sheider (Steven Spielberg ""Jaws""), Jessica Lange, Ann Reinking (Close, very close friend of Fosse who mades with Vereen -who appears too in this movie- famous ""Fosse"", a musical homage on Broadway), Leland Palmer, Ben Vereen, Erzsebet Foldi, Michael Tolan and Deborah Geffner stars in this perfect portrait of show business, dreams and tears.Bob Fosse's works in theater and movies are impossible to forget for those who has witnessed (Obviously i cannot see their plays - only parts in video - i born 4 years after his death, but thank God i have his movies to enjoy). His works in stage and screen includes ""Cabaret"" (Which, years after made his own movie adaptation), ""Sweet Charity"" (His film debut later. A marvelous adaptation to Fellini's ""Notti di Cabiria"", which are marvelous, funny and touching), ""The Pajama Game"", ""Damn Yankees"", ""Pippin"", ""Dancin'"", ""The Affairs of Dobie Gills"" (With Debbie Reynolds), ""Give a Girl a Break"", ""Kiss me Kate"", ""How to Succesed in Business without a Really Trying"", ""The Little Prince"" (As the Snake), ""Lenny"", ""All That Jazz"" and his last work ""Star 80"". In all his work we see a real artist working. Excellent as choreographer, director, writer and actor. And we can see perfectly this in ""All That Jazz"". And if much see it as a pretentious work, its because maybe they cant see how the really show business is. ""All That Jazz"" is a fabulous work that much of us maybe can appreciate. Is more than Fosse's life, is about his dreams, about his point of view of life, death and stage. The point of view of an artist who love its works, but a work that demands much (The related topic of Ingmar Bergman's ""Smulstronstället""). Then begins health and family problems. And we see that show business can be actually a good thing, but here is a question that not even me can answered ... the show business really worth? However, Bob Fosse demonstrate to the world his amazing world. He lives a life of light and dance. But too lives a world (If we follow ""All That Jazz"") of pain. Bob Fosse's life is a great teaching of survival to all that crap of selfishness of the same show business, and how is ore important the artist vision, how the art - which contains the thoughts, the love for anyone ... the point of view- cares much than the show business.One of the best musicals that i have ever seen.*Sorry for the mistakes ... well, if there any.",All That Jazz
58,blakiepeterson,A Frustrating But Unforgettable Experience,6,2 May 2015,"I wasn't clear what kind of film All That Jazz would be before I sat through it. Would it have the same attitude of a vehicle that features Liza Minnelli throatily singing about how much she loves New York, wrapped in a scarlet feather boa and draped in jewels? Or if it would be the kind of thing The Band Wagon was, only covered in pills and booze? All That Jazz is thankfully neither. Directed by legendary choreographer and director Bob Fosse, All That Jazz is painfully autobiographical; we know it, and so does Fosse. What we receive is a film that is both robust but recklessly uneven, uncompromising in its vision. Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider) is aging in his long and paramount career. As a man in love with the stage and never willing to invent a normal, strictly crowd-pleasing production, he has become exhausted; he works only with frenetic energy and is willing to stay up hours upon hours to perfect his goals. But all those years of light sleeping, pill-popping, alcohol consuming, womanizing, and smoking have finally caught up with him. Joe can barely handle it.In All That Jazz, Fosse's ideas are fearless, conveyed only in lightning speed. But only about half of them are thoroughly successful. His inhibitions are sometimes extremely dynamic, energetic, even touching, while others remain dynamic and energetic but lack that impassioned stinger. Take the ""Take Off with Us"" sequence, for example. The scene sees Gideon previewing his planned dance numbers for his upcoming play to executives who are offensively conservative but scared of being, dare I say it, mean. The one that comes before ""Take Off with Us"" has all of that theatrical ambition of a Fame piece; the executives already have the feeling that they're witnessing moments from their newest blockbuster. But what follows turns the practice studio into a smoking orgy of choreography, dubbed ""Airotica,"" leaving its dancers nearly nude, sweating profusely, and rumbling around in sexual energy. It's one of the best dance sequences I've ever seen in my life. It's the pinnacle of the film. Nothing truly follows it with that same brash excellence.Fosse is a treasure in the world of Broadway and a sporadic genius in the movies. All That Jazz is his 8 1/2, both stylistically and in tone. In style, it's slightly Truffaut, unafraid to jump cut, use ""natural"" music, and combine the contempts of real life and the joys of fantasy. In tone, it's almost uncomfortable in its self-reflexiveness, as the film mirrors Fosse's life.Yet in the end, All That Jazz is split down the middle between annoying self-indulgence and filmmaking brilliance. Fosse's boldness is easy to appreciate, but there are times when the film's in your face style leaves you with a headache rather than a new lease on life. But Scheider is terrific and so is Fosse's choreography; All That Jazz is the definition of a mixed bag, if there ever was one. Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com",All That Jazz
59,quinimdb,All That Jazz,10,8 April 2016,"""All That Jazz"" is a strange sort of autobiographical, self-referential, kind of surreal black comedy musical and character study of sorts. If that sounds really weird, that's because it is. But as strange as the film is, it's also incredibly original, and I kind of loved it.Joe Gideon is self centered and a sex addict. He won't let anyone else love him because he hates himself. And he loves to hate himself. He's also an insane perfectionist. No scratches that. He's not just a perfectionist, no one can please him, not even himself. His goal seems to be to create something he considers perfect, but he can't help but hate everything he does. He doesn't seem to care much about his life, and the only thing he seems to think about is dance. We get a look into his mind and all we see is a lady that Joe thinks is perfect (and that we never see in his real life) and a stage. Oh, also, it becomes increasingly obvious that Joe is actually Bob Fosse, the director of this film.The film charts his sort of trip into insanity, and as he begins dieing, his life becomes more and more consumed by his dance numbers, until eventually he can't tell whats even real and what's fake. The show business and dance numbers eventually become his life, and before he can reach what he considers perfection, it cuts to his dead body.Speaking of the editing, it's absolutely fantastic throughout the whole film. It's fast and mirrors the way that the character feels, such as the morning routine. It starts with close ups of him showering, taking pills, eye drops etc... Then it cuts to a wide shot of Joe standing before he says ""It's show-time, folks!"". This shows how he is not truly himself until he has entered the show business, and also shows that he thinks about his life as just a show, a production. As the film progresses, it becomes harder for him to continue in his ""show"" and the editing reflects this. There are many clips quickly edited together of him coughing and trying to say ""It's show- time"" but he can't quite get it out. As well as a slow motion close up of him taking the pills, and many other fantastic editing moments, not only in this scene, but in the whole film. It connects past, present, future, memory, and fantasy with ease and it's amazing to watch.This also contains easily Roy Scheider's greatest performance. He becomes this suffering, lonely, self indulgent character and it blew me away. This film may be very strange, and as self indulgent as the main character, but its also really great and there's nothing quite like it.",All That Jazz
60,pswanson00,All That Fosse,10,3 April 2004,"I love this movie completely, and in many different ways.  Firstly, I'm a fan of Bob Fosse, and love his work in making the film.  Secondly, I think Roy Scheider's portrayal of the Fosse figure is dead on target; he even moves well for a non-dancer.  Thirdly, I'll take any opportunity to watch Ann Reinking do anything. Fourthly, Jessica Lange, Leland Palmer, and Erzebet Foldi are wonderful in their supporting roles.  Add to all the above the sardonic John Lithgow and the dancing and breasts of Sandahl Bergman, and I'm a satisfied consumer.  I recommend this film both to dance lovers and pure film afficionadoes; I give it eleven stars out of ten. California Pete, film buff and dance maven",All That Jazz
61,steven_torrey,"He was a choreographer, let's not get carried away.",10,26 December 2020,"A good one, but still. For those philistines of us who can barely put one foot in front of another, we know him best from ""Cabaret"" or ""Chicago""; but of course, he had many other excellent productions to his name. The movie is a sort of Roman a Clef to his life and production.Bob Fosse would die some 71/2 years after this move was made at the relatively young age of 60, dying from excess pill popping, booze, and overwork. All graphically depicted in the move. The movie shows him, like so many actors, superannuated and in love with himself, which saves the viewer any anguish over not loving a not loveable character. I find severely limited the charms of drunks, druggies, and the self-indulgent. But hey, that's me.The movies excellent songs and dance numbers make the sum of the parts an excellent whole. For all the self-destruction that was Fosse, the production is lively and vibrant. Of especial note is Ann Reinking (who only died in the Fall of 2020 at age 70) dancing with Erzsebet Foldi as Fosse's daughter (with his wife Gwen Verdon), dancing to the song: ""Everything that is Old is New Again."" (Note how ""Thanks to the Memories"" sung by Bob Hope and Shirly Ross elevates a forgettable movie. Or Ann Southern singing ""The Last Time I Saw Paris"" elevated a forgettable movie.)The geniuses out there need to be reminded that before their genius is recognized with a production reflecting that genius, they are likely to be dead from booze or pills or drugs. Fosse was fortunate that he managed to live long enough to have his genius realized in artistic format.",All That Jazz
62,blazesnakes9,"It's showtime, folks!",8,12 October 2014,"While I was watching All That Jazz, I was reminded of a quote that Howard Hawks said. Hawks said that in order to make a good movie, you must have 3 good scenes and no bad scenes. Bob Fosse's All That Jazz has, what I believe, three good scenes and no bad scenes. However, the move itself has a depressing mood to it, which is similar or not with Fosse's other works like Cabaret and Sweet Charity. The movie centers around a deeply troubled dance choreographer, (Roy Scheider), who spends most of his life dedicated to his work in the theater. Yet, outside his life, his wife, (Ann Reinking), and his daughter are seeing himself fall into a world of self-destruction. Scheider is trying to create a Broadway show called ""Airotica"", which will debuted in the beginning of February. Scheider's character is a drug addict and cigarette-smoking womanizer, who tries to do the best he can by putting on a show. But, as he begins to put the show together, his life starts to take a turn for the worse. Edited in between the movie are moments when Scheider speaks to an angelic woman, (Jessica Lange), about his troubles and his virtues.The movie is torn apart by its portrayal of a man that is not only falling under the spell of self-destruction, but also falling into a near-death experience. This creates the movie's depressing tone, yet it does make us feel bad that Scheider is hurting himself more and more as he feeds his life and heart into his production. Toward the end of the movie, without giving much more away, the main character finds exactly what he is looking for. Like most of Fosse's work, this movie centers around the dark side of show business. What Fosse shows us in this movie is his own vision of his life in the showbiz industry. We understand fully throughout the movie that for all of the razzle and dazzle specialty that this movie has to offer, there's a dark undercurrent lying underneath the movie. The three scenes that I think makes the movie worth watching are when Scheider shows his agents his idea of the show and he lets the female and male dance performers do the number, which is called ""Take Off with Us (Reprise). That scene is so energetic that as the scene went on with the dancers moving their bodies suggestively in the light and especially in the dark, I realize that Fosse's direction creates much of the scene's energetic mood. The movement of the hands. The way the female dancer move to the left and right of the room. The scene oozes with a sense of extreme sexuality that we get completely lost in a world that is showered by movement and energy. That is one of the three scenes that I like in the movie.The second scene that I like so much is when Scheider's lover and daughter dances in his apartment. The musical number in this scene is called ""Everything Old is New Again."" I thought that of all of the scenes that were in the movie, this one was probably the best one in the movie. That scene is so well shot by Fosse and so well choreographed that it breaks through the depressing mood of the story. That's why the movie works for me. It has that ability to breaks through the depression and somehow feeds us a happy moment in the movie. Not only happy and jubilant, but also tragic. The third scene that I also like was when Scheider is shooting his own production number and like the scene that I mention before, his lover and his daughter also appear in this scene too. The wife and daughter do a number together, called ""After You've Gone"". The three scenes for me illustrates how much life and also feeling is being into this musical. Unlike Grease, which came out before this film, All That Jazz draws a tragic, downbeat and depressing tone to the musical genre. It also leaks sexuality since a lot of the numbers in this movie especially the rehearsal scene are very sexy.Roy Scheider give a outstanding performance as the main character. For a while, Scheider has been remembered as playing the police chief in Jaws or playing Gene Hackman's police partner in The French Connection. His performance make us want to care for him even though his response to the audience and to the supporting characters in the movie is ignored. This is a man who is walking on fire. He doesn't whether he makes it or not. I think what Bob Fosse shows us in this movie is that show business isn't about the stars and the razzle and dazzle. Showbiz can have a dark side, too. ★★★ 1/2 3 1/2 stars.",All That Jazz

The musical numbers are unforgettable, and Roy Scheider absolutely perfect as a Fosse clone. The film deserved every award it was nominated for or won. Two thumbs sky high for this film.",All That Jazz
64,ray-280,Beyond Brilliant (and I hate musicals!),10,19 June 2006,"Read my review of ""Newsies"" if you want my opinion of the musical genre. People just don't break into song-and-dance numbers in the course of their daily lives. Unless they are Bob Fosse, when suddenly doing so not only makes sense, but makes you wonder how we can go through life NOT singing and dancing.What this movie is, is simple: Bob Fosse unveiling his life, his knowledge, and a detailed explanation of his creative process, for future generations to evolve. This film is part biography, part self-exploration, and part legacy. It is the ""legacy"" part that is overlooked by almost everyone. If you ever dreamed of becoming a choreographer, this is the ideal place to start, because you'll watch, over and over, as Joe Gideon (Roy Schieder as the fictionalized Fosse) puts his stamp on a dance number, a process so unique and brilliant that it could easily be classified as its own form of dance rather than a subset of modern dance. If three words could sum up Fosse's style of choreography it would be ""make it sexier."" Then make it even sexier. Then, when you're done, you need to make it even sexier. The ""Airotica"" number exemplifies this, and served as the inspiration for Paula Abdul's ""Cold Hearted"" video.The movie brings Fosse's inner circle and personal life to the screen, pulling absolutely no punches. Some call this film a form of narcissism, but it's hard to see how a man looking for self-given glory would portray himself falling apart physically and personally, the years obviously having taken a toll, as well as the emotional baggage that comes with abandoning family life (and a brilliantly played daughter by Erzsebet Foldi, in what would be her only film before she retired) for a girlfriend with some side dishes for variety. The women hate Gideon's infidelity, but love the man so dearly they know not to question or challenge it.Throughout the film, we are treated to vignettes that comprise the mosaic that is the life of Fosse. Metaphors abound, and the music blends effortlessly into a film that can make two hours seem like two minutes. This is not a film that could have been written and will not be enjoyed by those of simple intellects. So much of the plot exists in the abstract, and it is up to the viewer to find what is often an incredibly subtle symbolism. Simply put, this is a well-constructed film. Fosse's ex-wife and dance protégé, Ann Reinking, auditioned for (!) and won the part based on her, while the supporting cast includes many solid names, even a young John Lithgow as Lucas. Fosse's daughter makes a cameo in the film, as does the film editor. The comedian who appears as the subject of a movie is based on Lenny, a previous Fosse film.Joe Gideon is what everyone should be no matter what they do: someone who doesn't copy others, but develops their own vision and then methodically, sometimes maniacally, makes it happen. He lives in the moment, and squeezes everything he can out of each moment. This is evidenced by Gideon's brilliant work, but also by his rapidly deteriorating health caused by living in the party moments as well as the serious ones.The ending number is for the ages, putting a spin on the sappy endings that musicals are famous for.Your life is lacking until you have seen this film. That it did not win the Best Picture Oscar for its year was an absolute tragedy. It is one of the five best films of all time.",All That Jazz
65,CalDexter,My Favourite Musical Of All Time.....Its Showtime!!!,10,4 November 2006,"From the moment Bob Fosse's All That Jazz starts, just about every scene is memorable whether it is flashback or hallucination.This is one of Roy Scheider's top roles. His Joe Gideon is a man with two much. Two much work, too much wine, too much cigarettes and too many women. His life is reviewed by the Angel Of Death (played by Jessica Lange) and sometimes we see him discuss with her points in his life when he should have done this and not done that etc. etc.It has been well documented that part of this film is based on certain aspects of Bob Fosse himself. There are many moments in this film that i love beside the musical numbers.1. Joe Gideon getting a chest examination from a Doctor coughing himself to death.2. Joe's daughter making faces at him from a departing Taxi as he waves to her in the pouring rain. Sweet moment.3. The rehearsal of the script scene, when everyone is laughing at a line in the play loudly, but Joe can only hear his own breathing and actions.4. Joe constantly tampering with the editing of his new film, convinced it is going to be a disaster.5. And finally, Joe (to the song 'perfect day' by Harry Nilsson) waltzing with one of his dance girls in his apartment then taking her to bed...simple but priceless.The choreography in this film is amazing. From the opening auditions for the fictional Broadway play to the last hallucination number, all the songs are wonderful and get better and better with each viewing. Favourite song moments are 'Fly Away With Us' (all the dancers in this scene are fantastic) 'After your Gone' (song brilliantly by Leland Palmer) and the final 'Bye Bye Love' which will bring a tear to the eye as it plays out. Special mention must go to Ben Veneer for a show stopping cameo as an imaginary TV personality and Ann Reinking as Joe's lover who dances superbly.If you love musicals like Carbaret and Moulin Rouge, then you will love All That Jazz, for me its my personal favourite Musical of all time!

67,HarlequeenStudio,Folks! What can I tell you about my next guest?,10,8 January 2019,"This is the best movie I've seen. From the opening ""cattle call"" scene, it remains fascinating to the very end. The best directing, the best acting, the best dancing, the best costume/set design, the best editing. I'm in awe of Bob Fosse and Roy Scheider, in fact, I think the latter was the best dramatic actor of them all, unfortunately trapped in a boxer's body and sentenced to straight-to-video action movies. I have seen many great film performances, but I have never been so touched by one. Joe Gideon, played by Roy Scheider, is not stricken by tragedy, is not a member of any minority group, doesn't fight for justice or survival and doesn't require prosthetic makeup. His tragedy stems from himself, he is his own undoing. But what drags him down is not his carelessness, it's his conscientiousness. He's a perfectionist. To achieve perfection, he needs a constant fuel of women, booze, cigarettes and Dexedrine. He grows as an artist, but never grows up. Or grows old. The film not only deals with death, it's the death of an artist. Quite a spectacle. The final scene is a masterpiece of cinema and religious art. It's the modern Transfiguration of Christ.
I remember one critic writing that it's not clear what drives Joe Gideon. Clearly his art is his life. And his death. It could be confusing for an outsider looking in, but as the end credits roll over the plastic bag to the tune of There's No Business Like Show Business, every artist understands and shivers. Joe Gideon is not only Bob Fosse or Roy Scheider, he's all of us.
Leland Palmer as Joe's ex wife, Ann Reinking as his girlfriend, Erzsebet Foldi as his young daughter and Jessica Lange as his angel of death give equally astounding performances. And so do all the dancers that appear in the opening scene and throughout the film. Ben Vereen, who finally hosts Joe's death, is funny, dark and electrifying. Ann Reinking's legs stretch from here to eternity and it's strange that she, Leland and Erzsebet didn't make another movie. Hollywood is sometimes only that much smart. And then, All That Jazz ended the era of musicals, because - who or what could top this? Fosse is God.",All That Jazz
68,inioi,Smart and honest self-criticism through a great musical,9,25 December 2015,"I remember watching the movie back in 1982, and what stuck most in my mind was the recurring scene of Roy Scheider facing the mirror with the eye drops and dexedrine tablets saying: ""It's showtime folks!""Bob Fosse made a overview about his life, in which recognizes that he is not taking the right path. Even so, he is still being able to succumb to the stream of indolence. It is as if he had no choice but to surrender to his self-destructive attitude.The film also has a transcendental view: he knows he is going to die soon. The role of ""Angel of Death"" is played by Jessica Lange, who listen his final statement. Despite of his misbehaviour, she does not judge him. This causes a strange feeling in the viewer: empathize with him notwithstanding what we have said.Anyway, what we have is an honest, well-directed and gripping musical autobiography. 9/10",All That Jazz

I can only imagine the smirk that must have been on Fosse's face throughout this production.  He doesn't ask for forgiveness, he doesn't try to justify Gideon's behavior, and he certainly didn't encourage Scheider to be sympathetic.  ""You're right, I'm a bastard,"" he seems to be saying.While catchy and professional, the musical numbers (particularly the art direction and costumes) range from tasteless to bombastic- as they were intended, I think.  The choreography is precise, the editing masterful, and the performances in sharp focus.  These elements, plus the acerbically mournful script, make for a fascinating deconstruction of self to an extent rarely, if ever, seen in the movies.Not every artist should think himself so interesting, but thankfully, both Fosse's professional and personal life merited such honest examination.  I can't think of any of our more iconic filmmakers today who have been turned the camera back on themselves in such unflinching fashion.Note:  Among the direct parallels to Fosse's actual career are ""The Stand-Up"" to ""Lenny"", and Lithgow's snooty Lucas Sergeant to theatre's estimable Harold Prince.",All That Jazz

There are many fine parts to it, such as Roy Scheider's powerful performance and the opening dance number. But it is a film that gets buried under its own excessive weight, with too much hokeyness, too many gags, and badly overblown fantasy sequences. I know that this was a labor of love for Fosse, and that it has eerie similarities to his death several years later. Yet every time it feels like Fosse is about to make a serious emotional statement, he ruins it with a silly fantasy or pointless dance routine. This is probably why the scenes with his wife and daughter are among the best, because they're the only ones that don't get interrupted by glitter and gaudiness.Bob Fosse could have made a film that depicted the struggle of the Broadway artist, that really showed us the ups, downs, and betweens of working in showbiz.

76,Momcat_of_Lomita,"Brilliant dancing and choreography, but flawed.",7,11 May 2011,"When this movie came out in 1979, it made a SENSATION. It generated a lot of debate: was it a self-indulgent pity-party that Bob Fosse threw for himself? Was it a scathing commentary on the business of entertainment? Was it a brilliant metaphor for for....something? Was it Fosse's payback for perceived injustices? Was it brilliant? Was it overdone? How much of Joe Gideon, the central character, represented Fosse's view of himself? It seemed to me that a lot of the reviews that were done at the time were more about the reviewer's erudition and knowledge of the minutiae of Fosse's career, and personal life, and the insider references in the film than about whether the movie was worth the cost of admission and the time out of your life to go see it.So that's how I want to address this movie: from the point of view of someone who is wondering if it's a good movie for entertainment.The answer is yes, but a very reluctant, qualified yes, with a warning that towards the end, the pace of the movie bogs down and it loses its narrative quality. If you're looking for a movie that maintains narrative momentum from beginning to end, that tells a story straightforwardly and without getting artsy, this is NOT a movie you're going to enjoy.Don't get me wrong: there are things about this movie that I loved as much as anything I've ever seen in a movie. If you love to watch dancing, if you're a fan of Fosse the choreographer, even if you just find it interesting to see the human body used as an interpretive vehicle through dance, this is a MUST-SEE movie. Leland Palmer as Joe Gideon's ex-wife, Anne Reinking as Joe Gideon's main girlfriend, are AWESOME dancers. Oh my god, what would it be like to be able to dance like that? The ""Take off With Us"" dance (sometimes referred to as the ""airotica"" dance) was groundbreaking and amazing. A ""must-see"" if you love musical dance numbers. The dancing and choreography are superlative. No doubt about it, if you love dance, this movie has something for you.The movie moves along smartly early on: the characters are engaging, you get hooked into wondering if the play and movie that Joe Gideon is working on are going to be successful, and you wonder about his relationships with his ex-wife, with Anne Reinking as his girlfriend Kate Jagger, even his relationship with dancer Victoria (Deborah Geffner). The movie is hard to fault in establishing the relationships and the tension about the projects Gideon is working on.Where it bogs down: when Gideon starts to have his heart trouble, and the movie disintegrates into metaphorical dance numbers and a really totally jarring open-heart surgery segment. Warning: if you are squeamish, this part of the movie will disturb you. If you're watching this on DVD or TiVo, this is where you will be grateful for the fast-forward button.At this point, the dance and musical numbers don't move the movie forward, in my opinion. They bog it down. It's all very metaphorical, and very artistic, and the dancing is good, but it is SLOOOOOWWWWWWWWW. It really screws up the pace of the movie. For me, that's the biggest flaw this movie has. Up until the heart attack hospital sequences, the movie flows smoothly. When it gets to this point, I find myself getting bored and wondering why it's dragging on so long.I also have a certain amount of ambivalence about the device of using Jessica Lange as a personification of Death. The device works early in the film, not so well towards the end, at least in my opinion. There's a point where it becomes melodramatic.So do I recommend this movie? I do, with reservations. If you're a Bob Fosse fan, it's a must-see. If you enjoy dancing, it's a must-see. If you're looking for a movie with a straightforward plot that moves smoothly along from beginning to end, you're probably going to be disappointed, because the movie is going to bog down and go on too long at the end. That's a serious flaw, all the more glaring because the first part of the movie is so good.Wish I could give it a stronger recommendation, but there it is: from a purely entertainment standpoint, it bogs down and loses steam at the end.",All That Jazz
77,jackbenimble,Creepy and macabre,1,13 November 2010,"This is pretty bad. All That Jazz starts off fairly well and I like tales of drink and drugs and fornicating anti heroes but the film falls apart on so many levels. First of all, Roy Scheider is a good actor but he's really miscast in this. Despite being really watchable he just doesn't cut it as a philandering drinking pill popper. He's just too straight a guy. But the worst part about this film is it takes a terrific dive about three quarters the way through when an endless death scene is played out between a hospital and a staged dance routine. This didn't work at all. You could see what the director was trying to do but it isn't funny or dark comedy or serious or anything at all. All you end up with is something entirely macabre and cringeworthy. After having watched so far I felt compelled to stay to the end with each last minute dragging out painfully with the film never seeming to end. Every second I found myself wishing our hero would die quickly and put me out of my misery. Death, dying, smoking, hospitals, coughing, blood, open heart surgery and dancing troupes in costumes covered in veins don't do it for me. Awful.",All That Jazz
78,JimS_8686,The End Of An Era in Cinema,10,18 March 2008,"Few movies have given insight into the grim reality of show business than All That Jazz. Director Bob Fosse's semi-autobiographical musical is highlighted by entertaining and terrifically choreographed numbers which give unexpected depth to the storyline. This unconventional blend is anchored by the outstanding performance of Roy Scheider as Joe Gideon. As the movie's focal point, the title character is loosely based on Fosse himself. Gideon is a man addicted to his work in show business and the vices that come along with it. Rather than a straightforward autobiographical tale, the dramatic narrative is rather uniquely presented. All That Jazz blends conventional storytelling, musical numbers, and an astonishing first person point-of-view sequence where Gideon suffers his first heart attack. All these elements intertwine seamlessly in pushing the story along to it's grim yet inevitable conclusion. The result is a masterful work of art by a true genius. The film, however, does not get bogged down by the song and dance moments and maintains believable realism with it's depiction of a man's journey towards his own self-destruction. When Roy Scheider passed recently, I thought immediately of his memorable work in All That Jazz. This is a movie that really stays with you, and there is no other film like it. All That Jazz was the swan song of a great decade in film-making, and brought to it a rousing yet unfortunate close. The 1970's were an unparalleled era in cinema defined by groundbreaking and truly important works of art. A time when directors took the medium as a serious form of entertainment and storytelling, while raising it into previously uncharted heights. This is one of the finest examples.",All That Jazz
79,Absyrd,"The very essence of cinema, a masterpiece of the 70s",10,7 February 2009,"All That Jazz may be the most colorful film I've ever seen. And it may also be the most thematically rich film I've seen in a long time, one that portrays a man's obsession with his art, his refutation and eventual embracement of death, his unlinear block between reality and fantasy, and his failure as a father and a husband, the only driving force of his life being his passion for art which he visualizes through his frustrating career as a theater director. It's a multilayered piece of neurotic fiction disguised as a musical about life and death, held together by a wonderful ensemble cast and some beautifully abstract dance numbers. Such a brilliant film.",All That Jazz

Yes, I was a professional dancer who is now a professional Choreographer and Director and I am very lucky to be able to make a living doing what I love.  The drama, the passion, the love of art, the sweat and blood and tears, the triumphs and failures...this is life in the theater. And this is exactly what Bob Fosse captured in this rivoting and beautiful film.  Based loosely on Mr. Fosse's life, this is hardly a ""True Story"". Never-the-less, every word in this film is true.  After many, many viewings over many, many yeas, this is still the one film that tells the straight story.  Scheider is brilliant as Gideon and the supporting cast is equally good, but the lion's share of the credit goes to Mr. Fosse.  Without missing a step, he manages to capture the true essence of stage life while developing the characters to such an extent that the ending, even after many viewings, is still an amazing shock.  If you have ever wondered what it was like to be in a production, forget those fake dance films (""A Chorus Line"", ""Center Stage"") and just watch this film.  Everyday, I go to the theater...and hear the ghost of Bob Fosse / Joey Gideon whispering in my ear, ""It's Showtime, Folks!""",All That Jazz
81,cgcastanedo-75966,"""Showtime Folks""",10,5 April 2020,"One of the most self-critical and honest movies in film history is Bob Fosse's introspection in his autobiographical film, All That Jazz, without a doubt the greatest cinematic achievement of his career. With enormous artistic virtues learned throughout his life, such as dance, choreography, acting, directing film, theater and TV, the author captures in this film his memories, including passages of his life with friends and enemies, family, loves, passions, excesses and the harbinger of his inevitable path to death. Although the production is from 1979, the director Bob Fosse through his character Joe Gideon, recounts the events of his life that occurred in 1974 in New York, during the staging of the musical ""Chicago"" in Broadway and the process of editing his 4th. feature film Lenny (His previous film had been the multi-award winning Cabaret where he got his Oscar as best director.) The film is so personal, that Bob Fosse considered playing himself. The envies and disagreements with directors and producers are real, just like her lover Kate in the film, she plays herself. His editor Alan Heim appears in the editing room, his real daughter is the girl in front of the soda machine.
Bob Fosse is one of the few, (or only) director who has won the greatest awards, in the entertainment industry, for his direction in both film, theater and TV:
Emmy on TV for ""Liza with a Z""
Tony in theater for ""Pippin""
Oscar and BAFTA in cinema for ""Cabaret"" Palme d'Or in cinema for ""All that Jazz""
""All That Jazz"" is the film that revolutionized the musical genre, due to its innumerable plastic qualities that spill out onto the screen, in the form of choreographic, editing, music and photography innovations, that consolidate a disturbing and forceful autobiographical vision of the past, present and future of the author. Masterful performance of Roy Scheider
Cast also includes: Jessica Lange, Leland Palmer, Ann Reinking, Davis Newman, O'Connor Flood, Erzsebet Foldi, Deborah Geffner, John Lithgow

82,dan9241,Fosse is a genius,8,12 April 2000,"""All That Jazz"" is almost a masterpiece - a brilliant autobiographical film directed by Bob Fosse. Maybe I'm biased since I'm a huge fan of Fosse's work, but I still think that this film is brilliant in many ways. First, you have the choreography. I can't watch a number like ""Take Off With Us,"" or ""Everything Old Is New Again,"" and NOT want to get up and dance. I get goosebumps just watching it.Next, you have the actors. Roy Scheider is the better than I've ever seen him here. With his goatee, cigarette, and black boots, he really looks like Fosse (although the character is not supposed to be Fosse himself, just based on him). Ann Reinking is one of the greatest dancers who ever lived, and it doesn't hurt that she was Fosse's girlfriend portraying Joe Gideon's (Scheider) girlfriend in the movie. Leland Palmer and Ben Vereen both starred in ""Pippin"" on stage for Fosse, and their talents are utilized again here. Add in the star power of Jessica Lange as the mysterious Angel of Death, and you've got a winning cast.Lastly, you have the material, and the way Fosse handles that material. You could write a book comparing the movie to Fosse's life with analysis after analysis. Instead, I'll just say that the style and pacing of the film is near-perfect - until the end. It loses a little bit of its energy with the too-long and drawn out production number ""Bye Bye Life."" It definitely could have been shorter. But the cynical message of the movie is not to be missed for those who enjoy dark movies, and especially for Fosse fans (although his ""Cabaret"" is better). 8/10",All That Jazz
83,talas1,Roy Schieder's Best Performance & A Great Film,10,19 August 2003,"This movie is very creative; interweaving the self-indulgence and self-awareness of Bob Fosse about his lifestyle and how it eventually wore him down through a too fast lifestyle.  As story telling and film, you can get no better than this; it's creative in ways that not many american films ever attained.Deep and real; dealing with human emotions in a very refreshing way. Shows how shallow american morals are; everyone's a bit of a hypocrite and Fosse was very good at it.  I had never known Schieder was this good an actor; and haven't seen much of it from him since then.

84,zach-27,"Flashy, sensual, sophisticated entertainment",9,14 December 1999,"I saw this movie nearly twenty years ago, and I still find it fascinating! It is a real sexy turn-on of a musical to be sure, but it is also a brutally honest confessional of the late Bob Fosse's life, in all its glitter, pain, and triumph.  In some scenes, even Roy Scheider eerily resembles the real Mr. Fosse.  Although much of the film is admittedly self-indulgent, it does raise some interesting questions about how a person lives his or her life, and how their lives affects others around them.But aside from the philosophy behind the movie, I recommend that  you watch the brilliant choreography, enjoy the satirical wit present in almost all of the musical set pieces, savor the costumes, the production design, and the flashy film editing.  But most of all, admire the mirror Bob Fosse held up to his own life, and without any reservations boldly turned that mirror around for all the world to see - a mirror of his life, a mirror of our lives, a mirror of the entire world...and ALL THAT JAZZ!",All That Jazz

Great performances from many theatre veterans, which the main public wouldn't even know about if it weren't for this film (i.e. Leland Palmer and Ann Reinking).  It also shows his talent as a director and writer.  Anyone who loved Cabaret is guaranteed to love this film equally.

86,lachlan-mcdougall,Drama On A Grand Scale,8,17 May 2014,"Bob Fosse's semi-autobiographical surreal musical comedy might be one of the most artistically intelligent musical movies I've seen in a while. Its meta-tale of the slow deconstruction of a man and his ego takes the quick cut aesthetic of Fosse's earlier expressionist masterpiece Cabaret (1972), but adds to the mix the almost terrifying reality that this is not a dream, this is Fosse's real life.The plot revolves around Fosse's fictional surrogate Joe Gideon's (deftly portrayed by Roy Scheider) efforts to balance his excessive lifestyle with the demands of simultaneously making a motion picture and directing a Broadway production. The real story, however, revolves around the masterful editing and surreal song-and-dance routines which build layer upon layer into the tragic melting pot.An ongoing interview with an angel of death, a repetition of the Gideon's daily routine of booze, pills, sex, and ""showtime"", and a multitude of stories, plays, and films within the film make it a real delight to watch. Perhaps it's not the simplest thing to get your head around when you're just looking for a feel-good musical, but that is not why All That Jazz is here: this is art.It must be said, however, that, for the final effort from one of the most accomplished musical directors and choreographers to ever grace the screen, the dance routines and musical numbers don't hold much water compared to a lot of other films. Yes, the ending Bye-Bye Life is a truly remarkable piece of cinema, but on the whole most of the actual 'musical' elements of this film don't really stick in your mind. Every dancer is more than competent and the whole thing is shot and edited with a touch of genius, but the routines themselves are just a little bit lackluster.The real accomplishment of this film, however, is not in its ability to be as good a musical as, say, Grease (1978), but rather it is to be found in the way Fosse expertly weaves the art-house cinema techniques of Fellini with the high camp of a Busby Berkeley number. It is a visual and intellectual feast that holds the audience from start to finish and does not leave them dissatisfied.It just plays out its almost Wagnerian opera sensibilities on such a grand scale that it hard not to be impressed by this film. The masks keep falling, the intrigue keeps on deepening, but it is all treated with a profound sense of subtlety that is rarely captured by films so lavish as this one. It is, in my opinion, one of those rare movies that you simply must see, even if you don't actually like musicals. Find yourself a copy, dim the lights, pour yourself a nice glass of champagne, and brace yourself for a long and winding ride through the heart, soul, and mind of one of the most interesting showbiz personalities of our time.",All That Jazz
87,3s2m,"Fosse's magnum opus, truly the best picture of 1979",10,24 February 2008,"Of all the supposedly great 1970s films that critics love to gush over, one they should be gushing over is this brilliant and sensational pastiche of razzamatazz, artistic ambition, obvious roman à clef and a starkly unsentimental view of show business. ""All That Jazz"" is all that and more.The late Roy Scheider shows the strength, depth, and range of his abilities as Joe Gideon, the hard-drinking, hard-living, hard-loving director of Broadway musicals and Hollywood films. It is largely because of his performance that the film is a success. For all the horrible, irresponsible things he does, Scheider makes Joe an extremely sympathetic character. It is easy to see why the women in his life, and his daughter Michelle, keep coming back to him in spite of everything; they want to love him. Underneath his cynical exterior is a burning desire to live, love, and be loved. The pathos in his life is handled beautifully and without a trace of sentimentality. The supporting cast works well, too, notably Jessica Lange as the angel of death, Ann Reinking (""Annie"") as Joe's girlfriend Katie, Max Wright (""ALF"") as the harried producer of Joe's film ""The Standup,"" and Cliff Gorman (""The Boys in the Band"") as the lead actor in that troubled film.Technically the film is a marvel. Fosse is at the peak of his directorial ability, and every scene shows a master touch. His musical numbers are some of the most exciting ever conceived for film; they are sensual, rhythmic, dynamic, and remain fresh after all this time. Fosse wannabes who have co-opted his unique style only serve to prove their own derivativeness (I'm talking to you, Rob Marshall). The editing fits the directorial style like a glove.This was truly the best picture of 1979; not ""Kramer Vs. Kramer,"" and not ""Apocalypse Now"" (nothing against those two films, though). It truly deserved the Oscars it did get, and the Palm D'Or at Cannes. It's certainly a lot more fun than 8 ½.

All that Jazz is director Bob Fosse's homage to the Broadway world and follows the life and death of Joe Gideon a, brilliant director and choreographer as he develops a new show while struggling with numerous health and personal problems.Gideon, played by Roy Schneider, is a hard drinking, drug taking womanizer but he still comes across as a warm and likable person. This is a tribute to Schneider's acting and I can't think of any film where he has done better than this. All the acting is first rate but I was particularly impressed with Erzebet Foldi who played Gideon's young daughter. I don't know if she went anywhere after this film but she certainly deserved to.The film contains flashbacks to Gideon's earlier life interspersed with interludes where he converses with the angel of death, personified as a beautiful young woman and it's funny, sad and uplifting all at the same time. The dance sequences are spectacular, right from the opening audition scene to the final farewell and I loved the musical score. Some people may find certain sequences a bit raunchy and I remember this being an issue with a few parties at the time the film was released. All that I can say is that everything contributes to the overall story and I didn't find it a problem at all.It must be pretty obvious by now that I Liked this film and I did.

Plus it had multiple Oscar nominations, so how bad could it be?.....I soon learned my answer after sitting through the entire painful 2 hours. While the real life exploits of Fosse can be titillating and fun to watch, the overall presentation and style was just hard to swallow. He at aspirations of Art, but just turned out a mess. About the only character I enjoyed was the girl l who played his daughter. And oddly enough she never acted in film before or since.Pretty much everyone in the film felt creepy and desperate. Maybe that was Fosse's intention. Plus I didn't enjoy 90% of the songs.

The editing and techniques were inspiring and mesmerizing to watch...you won't be disappointed as far as that goes.  The only aspect that may turn viewers away would be the theme.  It deals with drugs, sex, and rock and roll (or should I say ""Broadway"" style rock?)  I personally enjoyed the original use of visuals and sound effects.

Dance is the most ephemeral of all arts, and here we see Gideon, that poor player strutting his hour upon the stage, ""on triple overtime for the last seven months"", casting and directing a play that will never open.The sublimation oozes out in sex -- and wonderfully explores love, children, the meaning of life, and of course All That Jazz. The ending is wonderfully ambiguous -- he approaches death throughout the movie, and can't really say it is a spoiler to say that he finally consumates the relationship. But is it a happy ending? If it is true that ""Man must endure their going hence, even as their coming hither; Ripeness is all"" -- is Gideon successful?  We do see the rehearsal, even if the show doesn't open.

At first, I didn't like how these recurring scenes kept popping up. You'll see them in the movie. It, at times, detracts from the flow of the movie and throws a viewer off.There are also times when this movie just drags on and on and on and on. This movie could have been edited much more.

Gideon lived his life to excess and conveniently avoided intimacy with anyone or anything. His long line of female conquests were simply a part of his personal opiate. The death sequence was especially tragic. The three most important women in his life beg him to live. Yet he has never built anything of substance to anchor him in their world. Ultimately, Gideon succumbs to his wandering ways and falls into the arms of the beautiful angel of death (a stunningly virginal Jessica Lange); ironically, becoming the seducee rather than the seducer.

The end result is ALL THAT JAZZ> It's a brilliant and intense look at the insecure but brilliant Joe Gideon (based on Fosse himself and played by Roy Schneider). In the first five minutes of the film alone Fosse manages to capture more of the angst and worry of auditioning for a show than A CHORUS LINE THE MOVIE does in two hours. What follows ins a roller coaster ride through Gideon/Fosse's life directing and choreographing a new show while battling chest pains. These scenes are inter-cut with fantasy sequences where Gideon converses with Angelica - a seductive angel of death played by Jessica Lange. As much of Fosses later works - this movies is full of Broadway glitter and jazz alongside disturbingly dark themes such as death, infidelity, and substance abuse. Fosse's self vision is unflinching and as in real life we manage to actually cheer for Gideon even though he makes such lousy choices in his personal life much the way so many people adored Fosse despite his treatment of them. Of course when it comes to choreography and filming dance - there is none better than Fosse and this movie shows you why.

Guiseppe Retonno on the camera, Roy Scheider on the ""stage"" and Bob Fosse as a director, They have invited us to watch one of the greatest autobiographical films in the film history. It references to ""eight and a half"" (a Fellini film about a director who straggles between the women of his life and the film he can't make) and Godard's 60's films (Specially ""A Woman is a woman"", with a reference in this film to Fosse's directions in theater: the films pauses and Anna Karina has a sentence: Careography by Bob Fosse!).

100,tatsii,Masterful directing with objectionable content,7,25 April 2020,"Especially the directing of Bob Fosse and editing of Alan Helm are superb level. Fosses style is very recognizable and enjoyable. The film combines musical theatre elements in a surprising way to the story, creating nice rhythm to the structure of the film (although I might have liked to see them having more function dramaturgically). Roy Schneider does convincing job in the role of choreographer and director Joe Gideon. Those are some of the merits of this Palme d'or winner of 1980.The problem of the film is that we see the story entirely through the main characters eyes. Joe Gideon is a strong male character who dominates his lovers and subordinates with ruthless and reckless behaviour. Joe is a traditional character of a ""suffering male artist"" and is the reason why this film unfortunately has not lasted the test of time. Especially after the revelations of #metoo-movement inside the show business, some moments in the film are very unpleasant to watch. The film doesn't criticize the awfulness of the main characters behavior sufficiently and does not give enough voice for the victims. We do see Joe Gideon regretting his deeds to some extent, but the story falls flat and we do not see Joe treated the equal way compared to the way he has treated other people. This is at least what I interpreted the film is trying to do to some extent and it fails. It does feel like the main character has written and directed the movie himself... which in a way he has since the main character is based on Fosse himself (who wrote the script with Robert Alan Aurthur).From Fosses works I would recommend first and foremost Cabaret, in which we can enjoy the legendary directors skillset in a musical theatre context without the outdated narrow masculine point of view All That Jazz unfortunately has.",All That Jazz
101,mspt,A Personal Favorite,10,27 October 1998,"As a theatre professional, this movie is my personal favorite. I can understand that there are some who maybe put off by the theme and tone that Fosse takes, but when looking for a snapshot of hedonism, creativity, genius, and the pre-""Phantom"" American Musical Theatre, this movie is amazing. Oh, and did I mention the incredible dancing?Shunned by reviewers because of its nastily undisguised look at such theatre luminaries as Harold Prince, Michael Bennett, Stephen Schwartz and Gwen Verdon, and film luminaries such as Dustin Hoffman, the movie has started to re-emerge as the definitive movie of musical theatre and dance. You can't help but realize this when you discover that even Paula Abdul has used the famed ""Take Off With Us"" dance sequence as the basis of one of her own music videos.Not for the faint-hearted, this movie is loaded with talent, beautiful and jarring images, and even a moral. It maybe intentionally repugnant, but this was a ""mea culpa"" from a generously talented man who survived his hedonism and sought to warn others awary from its inevitable effects.See it. Enjoy it. Revel in it. If you're not careful, you might even learn something from it.",All That Jazz
102,t_s_h_d_t,A **** Film,10,25 April 2000,"All That Jazz is a visually stunning picture. Bob Fosse, in a style reminiscent of Fellini, has created a masterpiece that not only traces his own life, but acts as a metaphor for the END of the Cinematic Musical. Roy Scheider gives one of the finest performances of the 1970's, as Joe Gideon, choreographer/film director. The film chronicles the end of his life, utilizing musical numbers, dance segments, and chats with death. It is a very surreal and grand experience, puncuated by one of the themes of the film, and best expressed by Joe's question to God: ""Don't you like musicals?""",All That Jazz
103,dkbritt85,Style...,9,22 April 2003,"This movie is very interesting. It explores the mind of an obsessively grueling director/choreographer (based on Bob Fosse's career) and his mental and physical downfall. The music is spectacular, the dancing is unbelievable. This movie has great style, substance, and character. If you loved Cabaret, Fosse, Sweet Charity, or Chicago, you must see this film!",All That Jazz
104,Kienzle,"Lost classic, absolutely necessary viewing for anyone who takes modern dance or the musical genre seriously",10,6 May 2003,"By far the most interesting musical of the last half century, All That Jazz (1979) is a must see for anyone who enjoys dance, musicals, or Fosse himself on any level.  The film's only fault may be it's slow pace, but anyone who understands the genre will most likely be able to forgive this draw back by concentrating on the shear depth of each scene and number.  The self-effacing Fossse biography, the detailed account of where the most influential choreographer/dancer since 1950 found his style and creativity, and the number ""Take off with us"" a piece which both encapsulates what Fosse had done until that point and at the same time manages to be fifteen years ahead of its time.  Arguably Fosse's best work, it combines his a-symetrical all at once dance style, with his favorite subject matter, sex, and a bit of reflection on what Fosse basically did to musicals taking fruity mindless tunes and making then deep, dark, and lurid.  The number was included in the Tony award winning Fosse, but without context or nudity it lost a lot of its edge. (It is worth mentioning that the number's choreography is heavily ""sampled"" in the music video for ""Thriller"" and is faithfully recreated in the music videos ""Cold Hearted Snake"" by Paula Abdul (who is evidently still alive) and ""What a girl Wants"" by Christina Aguillera.)  Roy Scheider is better than you could possibly imagine, or at least better than I could have imagined, as the Fosse charecter and a young Jessica Lange is perfect as Death.  All That Jazz will generate lively discussion for anyone who is fortunate enough to find a copy of it, from dance majors to complete amateurs, if for no other reason than the fact that it has the most morbid recreation of a pop song I have ever witnessed in its finalle.  The last time I saw this film it took me 3 months to find a copy on VHS, so I'm not kidding when I say its rare, but its definately worth going out of the way for.",All That Jazz
105,vinniekmetz,The Most Human Film - Rendered In Pure Artistic Scope ***minimal spoilers***,10,12 December 2005,"Does art imitate life, or vice-versa? The brilliance of this film is that it suggests that they are imitating one another and the original, authentic part is the soul. That's too grandiose a sentiment, but here's what I mean: Does the sexy, risqué dance rehearsal number come from what is best about Gideon (his command and imagination in the art) or what is his worst, (his womanizing and failure to give honest commitment to those that love him in lieu of sexual gratification)? In the scene juxtaposing Gideon's open heart surgery with the conference on the insurance value of the show (one of the most compelling scenes in cinematic history; it manages to be graphic while maintaining dark comedic cadence) is Fosse making the cynical satirical point that life is cheap because a fiscal value CAN be put on it? Or is he mocking the cynics with a hard penance of life's bloody fragility right in the face? Those are philosophic points to be sure and there's such a rich variety of them in this movie, as to dazzle the mind. But to just concentrate on the cerebral is only half the wonder of this film which is a strong contender for Top 20 status in this writer's mind.The other half - pure Fosse - is the range of artistic expression utilized to present an integrated total whole. It's a movie that takes you the viewer on your own artistic journey from the guts of a production to the unseen polished art in Gideon's heart and mind, where even mortal death must be turned into art to be defeated. Shots of tedious life are shot in tedious muted tones, the footage looks raw at these times and if it owes anything to Fellini it's that the more hyper the closeup or edit to sparse angles, the more ""real"" the subject becomes and the LESS you feel you are watching a film.Time doesn't permit me to go on, and I don't know if any new viewers will even see this review - but if they are reading this, and you love great cinema - this is it.pax vk",All That Jazz

111,troydarling,Single-handedly ruined movie musicals,10,5 July 2000,"After All That Jazz, no one could create a more integrated, perfect musical film. The dance and vocal numbers are so character-based and natural that I can't imagine anyone being more successful. Visually, All That Jazz, inspired the nearly the entire 80's dance and video genre to the point that new viewers may look at All That Jazz as trite. Most point out the outstanding choreography, but the script is brilliantly structured, deftly layering and building the character of Joe Gideon and giving us real insight into his genius. Some have accused Fosse of egotism for putting this semi-autobiographical account of himself onscreen. But that's entirely missing the point, Fosse put himself onscreen in a move of great self-deprecation and humor. If anything the film seduces us as Joe Gideon seduces the women in his life, and we find ourselves excusing his behavior just as his women do. Perhaps not p.c., but excellent drama and characterization.",All That Jazz

The cutting of the scenes are emninent and the musical elements is fantastic. Roy Scheider is doing one of his best performances as Joe Gideon.

114,veronikanikkirom,Just something I wrote for a Cinema Studies class,9,15 September 2018,"This film has had an incredible impact on me. Recently having moved to the city, I have been unbelievably inspired. Inspired to take advantage of all the opportunities I have been given, to create art, to voice myself in the world. Having experienced success and support from those around me for taking artistic risks, I have been gaining more and more confidence in my actions. That is all well and good, I have been feeling the happiest I have been in a while, but this film really reminded me of how blurred the line between success and corruption becomes if you don't keep it in check. I left the class feeling quite depressed, something I can actually say I am thankful for. It meant I had something to figure out. What I realized I have to admit to myself is the part my ego plays in my life: my decisions, successes, failures... If an artist does not remain humble and allow himself to be a fool, he will never be satisfied with his art. I have always been an extreme perfectionist, something I am thankful for, but at the same time despise. Without a conscientious approach to anything, art especially, you can never produce quality. However, if that perfectionism never allows you to let go of your actions, your art, you can never live a satisfactory life. Having recently taken many risks, I often find myself picking them apart and shaming myself for them. Even in writing all of this I am exposing myself in a way that I was never been (and still not entirely am) comfortable with. This film reminded me that only in letting go can you find yourself. Only by being willing to admit that you were wrong in something fundamental can you learn to lead a better life. Voicing your truth and consequently realizing that you may have been wrong requires you to be willing to make a fool of yourself. That is the role of the comedian, the person who is willing to say what everyone is thinking but is too afraid to say. I see the character of Joe Gideon as the embodiment of someone who is not afraid to judge what is, but is not willing to expose himself to the world. Death is such a significant theme because death is the final admission of powerlessness, the most vulnerable you can allow yourself to be. In denying his death, Joe Gideon is denying the existence of something more powerful than his ego. The final scene was unbelievably touching because it showed him finally being vulnerable, finally admitting to his true belief that he is, in fact, ordinary. The motif of dance added incredibly to this main idea - dance reflects such a fundamental aspect of existence, the ability to give up control and be free in your action. As someone who has always struggled with allowing myself to act, speak, move freely in uncomfortable environments, I could relate to an unbelievable extent. I could much too well understand the suffering of Joe Gideon because that is the suffering that is so fundamental to human nature, that I would argue is what constitutes life. Life is the process of death and rebirth; it occurs in every individual with every failure. The very ending of the film was depressing, but perfect. Had he been shown to have lived, that would mean the continuation of his suffering, the survival of his ego. I believe that that is why artists die young; they cannot live with the feeling that their ego is greater than the ultimate, undeniable truth that is death. The fear of going down such a path is what makes me fear success. I am, at this point, uncertain of my ability to spend my life making a fool of myself in pursuit of greater truth. However, I believe that that is exactly the path one must take to live a fulfilling life. If I do not want to lay on my death bed regretting all the missed opportunities, I must now allow myself to make mistakes and to live my own truth. I must not be afraid to be an artist.",All That Jazz

I was so irritated by the first movie I went to see today (day off - Tammy) that I had to write a review. Then I followed it by a review of another current movie out which I loved (Maleficent), which brings me to my all time favorite movie, All That Jazz, and I promise you, after I get done with with this one, I will pack it in for the night until something else sends me over the edge. This is a film that never ever fails to disappoint. I think I've seen it maybe - at last count - and still counting - 20 twenty times. This movie holds up so well, so beautifully, it gets me every time and every time I am just as moved and taken as I was when I first saw it. Roy Scheider is brilliant, but he's nothing compared to Ann Reinking or Leland Palmer. I could sit and watch this movie without sound, the costumes that Wolsky did are so superb and spectacular, if you've never seen this movie again, don't read another word and watch it. It's the most classic of all classic Bob Fosse, with a sense of what is waiting for him that makes one want to believe in something more. The dance number - and no, this is not a spoiler and won't ruin it - is the number between Ann and the kid. Tell me you can see that just once. When I've had a bad day and don't know what's next, I YouTube that and everything is right in the world again. Again, I'm not going to offer any spoilers, but the movie only gets better with time and a frequent number of viewings. Jessica Lange never looked better. In fact, I'm not sure if any of them ever looked better and this movie - not any of the others - is what made me fall head over heels in LOVE with Bob Fosse. If you love dance, movement, relationship s**t, self realization, good writing - no great, writing, introspection, creativity - please see this movie and get back to me. I actually judge people on whether or not they got it, it's so good and worthy of anything I could possibly say. Okay. I hated Tammy with a passion. I hated the people that put that s**t out into the world,so I just made up for it by writing two review on movies that offer redemption for all the crap that's out there.

Our college story theater troupe had been touring Albuquerque public schools and went to see it an the now defunct Lobo Theater. All of us in the troupe were theatre majors and psyched to get to see this offering by Bob Fosse. We were not disappointed, to say the least. It is still one of the best depictions of what musical theatre, as a business and an art form, is all about. Auditions, cattle calls, singing auditions, rehearsals. On the DVD that came out in 2001, Roy Schieder narrates what it was like playing and working as/with Bob Fosse. I only wish some of the other actors could have commented on their experience doing the movie. If you are not a theatre person, drama jock or Tony fanatic then this movie is probably not for you.

The film is edited beautifully; choreographed flawlessly; lit with stark colors that almost fade to black and white at times; and acted with heart and verve, especially by Roy Scheider.  The film has one of the most effective uses of the zoom lens (despised by most filmmakers precisely for their inability to figure out when to use it) in film history.  The shot pulls back from a lone choreographer on the stage while multitudes of bodies go flying by him, letting us feel his insurmountable task of choosing which of these people will make his show come alive.  Some may say the final series of musical numbers runs long but I defy anyone these days to sustain a musical film with the same success.  ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Chicago"", excellent films that they are, play their cards fast and furious, hoping to razzle-dazzle us just long enough that we'll stay tuned.

124,poetrysweetheart,"""All That Jazz"" leaves the audience feeling left out.",4,30 January 2010,"A semi-autobiographical musical that leaves the viewer feeling confused and slightly disappointed, ""All That Jazz"" was directed by Bob Fosse and released in 1979. Following the life of Joe Gideon, played by Roy Scheider, as he choreographs, womanizes, and abuses his way to self-destruction, ""All That Jazz"" actually chronicles the life of Bob Fosse – a well-known musical theatre choreographer and director, screenwriter, and film director. While the art direction is superb, the costumes nearly flawless, and the score really, really moving, I kept waiting for the film to get better, and it never did. Between the wide area of subject matter (from the movie that Gideon was supposedly editing, to rehearsals for a new musical that he was staging, to his various complicated relationships with his ex-wife, girlfriend, and daughter), not actually knowing who Bob Fosse is, and the random, seemingly nonsensical Angel of Death (Jessica Lange) scenes, I spent the entire movie feeling like I was on the outside of an inside joke.The movie was choppy. It is not the editing and transitions that were choppy – and what transitions were choppy were that way for artistic value – but that the film jumped from one area to the next without giving the viewer time to catch up. In one scene you would be watching Gideon direct his dancers in the moves for a number, in the next he would be conversing with Angelique, the Angel of Death, on a topic that seemed to have nothing to do with the rehearsals we had just seen, and then in the next scene, he would be editing a movie that seemed to only be included in ""All That Jazz"" because it focused on the various stages of death. While some could argue that such choppiness was for artistic value, or that it was to make a specific point, I would say that you lose the value and the point when the movie becomes unintelligible and impossible to keep up with.The costumes, although there wasn't really all that much to them until the closing scene, were great. The mis-matched leotards and leg warmers contrasting with business suits and button-down shirts, only seemed to add to the gritty, slightly maniacal feel of the movie itself. The score was my favorite part of the film – along with the final number where Gideon sings to an audience of the movie's entire cast. The score was sharp and impeccably crafted and worked endlessly to try to create emotions and reactions that the choppiness of the film itself only took away from. The color, also, was incredibly well done, and could be appreciated most in scenes like the one where Joe is taken to the hospital, when the walls and the doctors' uniforms are all starkly white, giving the messy, colorful Gideon the air of being out of place and too contrary to save.The actors did what they could with a script that was jumbled and confused. Gideon had incredible chemistry with all of the women he had to work with on the screen, excepting Jessica Lange as Angelique – his scenes with her seemed wooden and out of place. However, his chemistry with Leland Palmer, who plays his former wife; Erzsabet Foldi, his daughter; Cynd Charisse, his mistress; and Deborah Geffner as a one-night stand is all fantastic – and all four of them manage to hold their own in solo scenes or interactions with each other. Roy Scheider himself carries the entire movie, giving an impassioned and heart-wrenching performance as the destructive, lonely Joe Gideon which gives the movie most of its soul and, for me, most of its value.Far more messy in the way that it is told and the subject matter that it tries to cover than other musicals – ""Chicago"" comes to mind – ""All That Jazz"" is a movie that, I believe, could have lasting value for those who know enough about Bob Fosse to appreciate the story that it tries to tell and the nuances – such as his ritual of declaring, ""It's showtime, folks!"" to himself in the mirror every morning – that it covers. However, if you are like me and have no idea who Bob Fosse is or of the impact that he seems to have had on American musical theatre and film, then the movie might not do much for you. It'll probably even make you feel left out.",All That Jazz
125,jamesmparkerson,Outstanding! One of the greats!,10,22 February 2011,"One of the 'perfect movies'. A perfect movie cannot be improved by recasting, rewriting, re-shooting. For a show to be perfect, it must be so spot-on that any changes would diminish it. Scheider carried all the lead role's demands, from broad strokes to subtle nuances, perfectly. From scene to scene, the viewer becomes aware that while living it up, breaking hearts, stunning producers and angels, Scheider's character is slowly killing himself, his symptoms slowly taking over the progress of the tale. His work is perfectly underscored by Leland Palmer as Audrey Paris, the ex-wife star of the show within the show; Ann Reinking as Kate Jagger, the long-suffering girlfriend; Erzsebet Foldi as daughter Michelle; and Jessica Lange as the Grim Reaper. All give perfectly tuned ensemble performances, perfectly matched as a dance team and as characters important to telling the lead's story.",All That Jazz
126,christopher-russell64,Fosse film version of CHICAGO is good,7,25 May 2017,"Particularly of interest in this film is the strong autobiographical quality of it. Fosse did, indeed, suffer his first heart attack during this 1973/74 period of his life. The film-within-the-film, ""The Stand Up,"" is an interesting variation on LENNY (1974, with Dustin Hoffman and Valerie Perrine)--- much more irritating than that movie. LENNY ended up getting great reviews, for the most part, but it must have been a tough movie for Fosse to get his hands around, especially while dealing with his failed marriage to Broadway star Gwen Verdon (portrayed here by Leland Palmer). It's certainly portrayed as such in this film. And Chicago seems to have been a challenge for him, too. He obviously thought the original script for that show was lacking (as he actually went on record as saying) and that he had to spice it up for him to become interested in it. (How fascinating would a Fosse film version of CHICAGO have been? As it was, it looks as if eventual CHICAGO director Rob Marshall screened ALL THAT JAZZ many times in order to mine its many storytelling treasures, including the main conceit that most of the film's musical numbers appear in the minds of the main characters.)",All That Jazz
127,elb227-1,A couple more pieces of ironic casting,8,8 October 2006,"I just saw the movie for the first time since its initial release and was struck by how well it holds up. The casting alone is quite remarkable, the set design is often striking, and the entire roman-a-clef peek inside the life of Bob Fosse remains fascinating.There are at least two more pieces of ""insider"" ironic casting that appears to have not been mentioned. One was the casting of Cliff Gorman as the stand-up comedian in the ""Lenny""-type movie-within-the-movie (here called ""Stand-up""). Gorman originated the part of Lenny Bruce in the original Broadway version of ""Lenny,"" but lost the movie role to Dustin Hoffman.The other is the casting of Ann Reinking as Gideon's lover. Ann Reinking was Fosse's lover in real life.",All That Jazz
128,pattymcnamara,If I had a dollar for every time I've watched this movie....,10,25 January 2010,"I first watched this movie in 79 when it was brand new. I was not then, and am not now, a fan of dance movies in general so I can't explain my fascination with this one. There is just something about it. When I found it on DVD years ago I was thrilled beyond words and I have watched it so many times I'm amazed it isn't worn out. After 31 years I still get goosebumps during the finale.I don't have any great insights in to what makes a great movie - I just know what I like and what I find entertaining. I will be watching this one for the rest of my days. I've shared it with many friends and have never heard a bad review.",All That Jazz
129,redravensounds,Excellent! Highest Rating!,10,13 December 2004,"""All that Jazz"" is one of my favorite movies on many levels. As a professional dancer, I scrutinize it choreographically, I also get major butterflies watching the cattle call at the start of the movie. Nothing like being treated as a numerical piece of dancing meat. That is EXACTLY how it is. I get a major kick out of watching that poor guy who is totally lost, and is desperately trying to follow the other dancers, rather than picking up the choreography from the dance mistress. Yup, there is usually one of those and you have to give them credit for being at the cattle call in the first place. The ""airline"" combination was incredible, and right on dead perfect! I was grabbing for air by the end of it, just like the dancers on the screen! The combination that was done by Ann Reinking and the girl playing Joe Gideons daughter to ""Everything Old is New Again"" was just as the others, spot on. Ann Reinking is an incredible dancer! Now as to the non-dancing aspects.... Joe Gideon is an everything-a-holic, and those people really do exist. They are totally consumed, and they will burn out pretty fast, thus the morning ritual, of cigarette, Vivaldi, Alka-Seltzer Visine, and a Dexie. Not a very good way to live....... he is trapped between his art, his ""a-holism"" and his love for his daughter, which is the steadying force in his life. Roy Sheider plays that part magnificently, and in an almost heartbreaking fashion. He really nailed it. The choreography in the dream sequence was once again absolutely incredible and absolutely Fosse. Just wow..... Finally, his death finale was the way any artist would like to check out.... dancing and busting there gut for an audience...... Although Joe Gideon truly bombed in his relationship bag, he blew the top off in everything else he did... although the movie he was trying to shoot, was clearly not his best effort, and he was never very happy with the ""Stand-Up""...... And how better to end a movie about dancing and the ""Biz"" than with Ethel Merman singing ""There's No Business Like Show Business!"" I can't think of a better, or more gritty movie, than ""All That Jazz""",All That Jazz
130,tbus-672-653424,"A unique script, nicely acted, beautifully directed.",7,11 December 2013,"I had never thought much of Roy Scheider till I saw this movie late one night, quite by chance. It was inspired casting on Bob Fosse's part I think, cant imagine anyone else as Joe Gideon.Although I do not usually enjoy ""musicals"" I do thoroughly enjoy this slightly surreal, slightly gritty movie that presents a series of colorful tableau culminating in a memorable final scene.Although the story is considered to be autobiographic the underlying study of a self destructive psyche and approach of death is intriguing, set in a back drop of modern dance and music.Probably has to find a place in my 100 favorite movies.",All That Jazz
131,andrew-h-willis,Oh Dear,1,10 December 2006,"I'm a great fan of Bob Fosse's theatrical work, but this movie is a completely different story. True, some of the dance numbers are worth watching especially towards the end, but the whole picture is confusing from the start with fast cuts back and forth throughout, with nothing to help progress the story or develop the characters.Because of the jumping around the time line is also fairly confusing, where are we, when is this happening ? On the plus side there are a couple of funny moments - I was mildly amused by the scene where the doctor is examining Joe Gideon while they are both smoking and both coughing. This film won four Oscars which does surprise me somewhat although these were in the categories of Art Direction, Costume Design, Editing and Score. Perhaps it was a slow year in 1979.If Bob Fosse were alive today I would advise him to stick to choreography and Roy Scheider - Stick to shark hunting.",All That Jazz
132,sideshowsteff,Ridiculous film about a showbiz loser that doesn't make sense at all,1,10 July 2006,"All That Jazz is one of the worst films I've ever seen! First of all; the opening scene goes on for a lifetime. We understand that they dance and that They are hard working dance students. Second; Roy is ugly as hell and cannot act at all. You do not believe that he is a showbiz man for a second. The film is approx. 2 and a half hours but it feels like 12. I saw it on cable one night and will never ever forget that night. I still had to buy it the other day on DVD, just to see it again, and oh my god I was taken back to that night of hell once again. Now I use to lend the DVD to friends just to make their lives miserable. Finally, the music is so bad that you need to listen to good music for hours afterwords just to stay sane.",All That Jazz

135,pthomasjr,My favorite Movie of all times,10,18 February 2006,"I was 19 when I first viewed ""ALL THAT JAZZ"". It took me another 2 viewings to finally understand what was going on. The last scene with Ben Vereen and the death fantasy, drew me in so far, that Joe's death caught me off guard. I found this C.D. for $5 bucks in a movie dump pile and jumped all over it. Watched again last night with my wife and stilled picked up on some things I missed before. I'm just wondering if this movie was based on Bob Fossee life. I can't imagine anyone being so work driven, with such a passion for excellence. Joe sounded like he had more women than Wrigley's got chewing gum. I love the dancing and cinematography. This movie leaves me feeling sorry for old Joe, but I guess he had it coming in the end. Great Movie",All That Jazz
136,Chimeros1170,The Best American Movie No One Has Seen,10,21 October 2008,"I first happened upon this movie a little over a year ago, and many viewings later, I am still captivated and amazed by its quality and presence. Fosse puts himself up completely for criticism by allowing Roy Scheider's Joe Gideon to embody everything he saw that was negative about himself. He creates a neurotic character almost predestined for destruction the moment the movie begins.The film is shot so cohesively and so well that it puts you fully into Gideon's mind and provides a door into a man's subconscious in a way that almost no other film does (notable exceptions include Captain Willard in Apocalypse Now!) It is nearly impossible to consider this film as a musical, because the narrative qualities counterbalance the overall story so effectively that it transcends all the clichés and trends of the musical. The film also has what I consider to be the best ending of any film I have ever seen. If I could die by going out with a musical number, sign me up.In conclusion, I urge anyone who has a chance to pick up this movie to see it and hopefully, you will enjoy it as much as I do",All That Jazz
