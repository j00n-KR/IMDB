0,Leofwine_draca,Does all it needs to,8,29 October 2020,"BRAVEN is a low budget action thriller that reminded me a little of the similarly good AGGRESSION SCALE: small-scale set-up, imposing villains, a resourceful hero, some HOME ALONE-inspired bits of creativity and defence. This time around the setting is an effectively chilly Canadian north, where logger Jason Mamora balances family life with caring for his dementia-suffering father (a sensitive turn from Stephen Lang). After the usual character-based build-up, they're thrown into a plot involving Garret Dillahunt and his drug gang, and a desperate fight for survival takes place. There's some decent action going on here with impressive little touches, and Mamora acquits himself better to this role than he did, say, as Conan. The lack of budget is evident in a couple of stunt shots, but otherwise this is a film that does all it needs to.",Braven
1,SnoopyStyle,slow start gets better,6,3 August 2018,"Joe Braven (Jason Momoa) has his family and his logging company. His father Linden (Stephen Lang) suffers from dementia. After a bar fight, pressure builds to put his Pops into a home. He resists and takes Pops out to his cabin. Unbeknownst to him, one of his log truck drivers, Weston, is transporting drugs with Hallett. They crash on a snowy road and rush to hide the drug stash in Joe's shack. The incompetent pair's drug boss Kassen (Garret Dillahunt) leads the gang to recover his drugs the next day and it becomes a deadly cat and mouse game.The first half is a bit slow. It spends too much time with the family. Introducing Joe as a family man should not take this much screen time. His father's dementia feels like a side plot point. It could have come in handy to instigate the standoff but the ignition is more problematic than that. There are different ways for Joe to ignite the confrontation. Splitting the drug stash in half is one of the inferior options. He should probably try to give it all to Kassen hoping that he would leave on his own accord. I doubt Kassen could ever leave the cabin without securing all of his drugs. Joe's plan is an unlikely pipe dream. His father's dementia could have been used as a catalyst for everything. The daughter's jacket is too bright purple. A smart man would turn it inside out for better camouflage. Joe ends up using too many special weapons. It's a little too Home Alone. I do like Momoa, Dillahunt, and Lang. They fit the setting and the manhunt plot. The cabin is probably too nice and the production couldn't afford to do much damage. They would probably be better off with a rundown shack where the bad guys can shoot the hell up. They could burn it down for real rather than the obvious fake fires. The second half does have some cat and mouse fun. This is good enough.",Braven
2,nogodnomasters,Do you remember what you did last night?,6,16 February 2018,"Joe Braven (Jason Momoa) works in the lumber industry in Canada. Circumstances causes his crooked driver to hide his drugs at Joe's remote unoccupied cabin. When armed bad guys come for the drugs, Joe and family are there closing it down for the season. The crime/action film is fairly straight forward. The conversation is dry for the most part. Interesting ending. Nothing spectacular. Watch it and forget it. Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Braven
3,kosmasp,Fighter,6,2 December 2020,"Jason Momoa can fight - ok so that may not be news to anyone. And maybe it is only true in movies. But he does have the physique that suggests that. Now how do you put that in a movie? And how do you incorporate his father (film father) Stephen Lang? Who may be more famous to most as the bad guy in Avatar. Here we have a different bad guy - who really does a great job in portraying his evilness.Having said that, logic flies out of the window in many scenes. Like in a diner scene, where you can just murder someone without repurcussions! With at least a dozen of witnesses. Yes I know this is to establish the madness of the bad guy. I'm just saying don't expect this to make sense. If you come around accepting that, you can have some fun with the movie",Braven
4,zardoz-13,Sluggish Potboiler About Narcotics Wastes A Gifted Cast,5,27 April 2018,"Stunt man turned director Lin Oeding's debut as a director in the Jason Momoa's actioneer ""Braven"" qualifies as a formulaic outdoors thriller. Joe Braven (Jason Momoa of ""Justice League"") has his hands full with a logging firm that he owns, a wife and daughter, and a father who suffers from dementia. One of his truckers has thrown in with a drug smuggling gang and decides to haul narcotics concealed in huge logs. Trouble enters paradise when the idiotic driver flips his truck, and his partner and he stash the drugs temporarily at a mountain cabin that his boss owns. Meanwhile, Braven's father Linden (Stephen Lang of ""Avatar"") gets into a messy bar fight when he mistakenly believes that his dead wife is one of the female patrons. Braven bursts into the bar as two guys are working him over and defends his dad. Fortunately, the guys that Linden tangled with refuse to press charges because one of them is on probation. The county sheriff knows about Linden's woes and warns Braven that he will be arrested along with his father the next time something like this occurs. Braven and his wife Stephanie (Jill Wagner of ""Splinter"") abhor the idea of confining Linden to a facility, so Stephanie suggests that Linden have input into their decision. Braven and his father head off into the mountains to his cabin to discuss his future. When they arrive at the cabin, they discover that somebody has been broken into it. They find a bag of drugs. No sooner have they made their discovery than Braven's young daughter surprises them with her presence. She sneaked into the back of their truck and rode with them against the wishes of her mother. Not long afterward, the villains show up with enough firepower to start a small war. You know several things are not going to happen in this tolerable but predictable melodrama. Neither Stephanie nor her daughter Charlotte (Sasha Rossof of ""Thinking Speed"") are going to be seriously injured. None of the obnoxious villain are going to survive, and each will die in some savage fashion. One takes an ax in the head. Another thug (Garret Dillahunt of ""Wheelman"") plunges off a cliff into an icy sea. When Stephanie learns that Charlotte has left with Linden and Joe, she picks out her bow and arrow and careens off to save her daughter. The Canadian scenery will give you more chills that the prefabricated heroics. Jason Momoa plays a considerate, sympathetic son on the horns of a dilemma about his father. Of course, you know that Linden isn't going to make it off the mountain. Sadly, a gifted actor like Stephen Lang is squandered in the role of the father. Nothing genuinely surprising happens in the fair but forgettable ""Braven.""",Braven
5,Wizard-8,Competent take on an old formula,6,25 November 2018,"As I indicated in my subject line, ""Braven"" takes its basic plot from a whole bunch of films that have used it before (kind of a variation of ""The Most Dangerous Game""). But there is nothing wrong with a movie using an old formula as long as the execution is done well, and the filmmakers this time around did things fairly well. Now, I will admit the movie is far from perfect. It takes about half of the running time for the movie to really kick into gear and get going. Also, some of the character actions are unbelievable and/or silly. Those flaws did lower my rating by one of two points. But there is still enough good stuff here to satisfy action fans. The winter wilderness scenery is beautiful and adds a fresh backdrop. The movie does click forward at a good pace so that there aren't any boring bits. And there are some exciting action sequences. If you don't mind seeing this basic formula once again, and you are prepared to accept some less than desirable plotting, most likely you will find this movie an acceptable retread.",Braven
6,Wuchakk,Fighting drug runners in the snowy wilds with Jason Momoa,6,27 December 2020,"A logger in Washington State (Jason Momoa) is forced to defend his family against a group of violent drug runners in the wintry woods. Stephen Lang and Jill Wagner play the father and wife while Garret Dillahunt and Zahn McClarnon play heavies.""Braven"" (2018) is an action/thriller that takes place in the snowy sticks in the mold of ""Sugar Mountain"" (2016), ""Hold the Dark"" (2018), ""The Edge"" (1997) and maybe ""Cliffhanger"" (1993). While it's the least of these, it's not bad and has its points of interest. There's a one-man-army element akin to Rambo. What holds the movie back is a couple unbelievable action sequences, like the protagonist's rope strategy at the end. Why Sure!But the locations and cast are good, as well as the superlative score. A little bit of ""The Last of the Mohicans"" (1992) is thrown into the mix. Regrettably, the flick scores weakly on the feminine front.The film runs 1 hour, 34 minutes, and was shot in Newfoundland, Canada, with establishing shots of the Great Northwest and some CGI mountains in the background.GRADE: B-/C+",Braven
7,Hellmant,"A lot of fun, if you like traditional 'tough guy' action movies.",7,27 April 2018,"'BRAVEN': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)An action-thriller starring Jason Momoa as a logging company owner, and family man, who has to deal with some hostile drug dealers that are looking for their stashed loot. It costars Stephen Lang, Garret Dillahunt, Jill Wagner, Zahn McClarnon and Brendan Fletcher. The film was directed by veteran stuntman turned first time feature filmmaker Lin Oeding, and it was written by first time screenwriters Mike Nilon and Thomas Pa'a Sibbett. The movie has received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's now available for rent on video and VOD. I enjoyed it. Joe Braven (Momoa) is a logging company owner, as well as a husband and father. When Joe's father, Linden (Lang), gets in a bar fight, due to his dementia, Joe decides to take their whole family out to the family log cabin, deep in the woods, for a break. Once there though, Joe and his family are greeted by ruthless drug dealers, that are looking for drugs that have been stashed at the cabin. Knowing that they'll all be killed once the men get their drugs, Joe turns to his survival instincts to protect his family.The movie is a surprisingly well made action flick. It's not overly cheesy, and some of the action scenes are actually pretty clever and fun. Momoa makes a cool action hero leading man, and Dillahunt is a great villain too (I also love Stephen Lang, in everything he does). The film is definitely a lot of fun, if you like traditional 'tough guy' action movies.",Braven
8,Robert_duder,A solid action thriller with a hint of old school,8,28 November 2018,"Steven Segal stars as....just kidding. Dwayne Johnson stars as... no no. Jason Mamoa stars as our hero but this is the type of film that Segal could have done back in the day or Johnson could do now. Some would say it's predictable and formulaic and maybe that's true but it's still a very good action thriller that hits all the points it needs to and turns in an entertaining easy watching experience. It's not Die Hard by any means but it fits the bill. It's about protecting family and being in the wrong place at the wrong time and the cast is very good. It definitely is a throw back to the 80's and 90's type ""one man survival"" movies like Die Hard but it has a lot of heart too and intense moments. It moves at a fast pace and doesn't really try to be what it's not.
Jason Mamoa leads the film flawlessly. He's a logger and a family man and a strong sensitive guy who kills to save his family. Part of me wanted to see him more like an unstoppable killing machine like Rambo but the role he plays is more realistic than that because he's not a ""former Navy Seal."" He's just a logger who has to protect his family. Garret Dillahunt is a brilliant villain. He's the old school 80's villains we loved to hate. He's this tough as nails blood thirsty drug dealer and he plays the role well. He's the perfect adversary because he has no sympathy for anyone. Stephen Lang is terrific as Mamoa's father who is suffering from early stages of dementia. The two of them have great chemistry and he adds a level of depth to the story. Jill Wagner and Sasha Rossof are also decent in small roles as Mamoa's wife and daughter.
Throughout the film, although I enjoyed it a lot, I kept feeling like it was missing something or wasn't hitting the mark in every way. This is the first full length feature for director Lin Oeding but he comes from a background of stunts and directing television and I think that's what I noticed with this is it feels like a television episode and doesn't quite hit the mark of a feature length film as well as it could. That's not to say it's not worth the watch, it absolutely is but at the end of the day it's mostly forgettable but for the hour and a half you're watching it, you will truly enjoy yourself. 8/10",Braven
9,851222,A by the numbers flick,6,6 February 2018,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Braven"" (2018) is the kind of movie which you have already seen many, many times. This is by the numbers action flick, which only great thing is locations - they are more then gorgeous. Everything else here although not bad for a boring evening stuff, but have been seen many times.Overall, ""Braven"" is a disappointing flick because it plays safely and you can see everything miles before it happens.

10,eddie_baggins,A solid attempt by Momoa,5,1 October 2018,"Setting out to prove his more than just Khal Drogo from Game of Thrones and Aquaman from the DC universe, muscle-clad actor Jason Mamoa produces and stars as timberyard worker turned thug killer Joe Braven in this gritty, if rather familiar thriller, that showcases the hulking screen presence can indeed carry a film in his own right, no trident or dragon eggs needed.Clearly a low-budget affair but one that attracted a solid cast of character actors such as Stephen Lang as Joe's dementia suffering dad Linden and Garret Dillahunt as chief big-bad Kassen, director Lin Oeding, who makes his directional debut here, slowly builds up Braven to eventually unleash an almost hour long battle for survival as Joe and Linden take matters into their own hands after a bunch of drug dealing thugs arrive at their secluded hunting cabin to claim a stash of dope that is hidden there without their knowledge.Proficiently handling the action without ever allowing proceedings to get too bloody or brutal, Oeding shows us all that he can handle the action stakes well but Braven isn't ever as thrilling or captivating as it should be, especially when this high-concept idea requires us to spend so much time in small area with a small cast.It's a wise move that Braven takes so long to get into the thick of the action as once the first bullets are fired there's frightfully little character development that happens from there on and while we don't exactly need that in film's of this ilk and we definitely don't expect it, Braven makes it relatively hard to care to much for what's going on as Joe seems to be a more than capable one man army, even more so with Linden watching his back with a rifle in hand.Great action film's set in small spaces or confined areas such as brilliant Indonesian action film The Raid or classics like Assault on Precinct 13 keep things ticking a long with a careful balance of white knuckle tension and action and enough character development to keep us invested outside of the carnage and Braven doesn't quite have that even if it makes perfect sense for the film to be your next choice for a Saturday night pizza and movie night.Final Say - Braven is loud, brash and dumb but its delivered in a manner that makes it highly watchable, without ever becoming highly recommendable. Lead by a committed Momoa, Braven is the ideal movie for when you want to switch your brain off and a solid attempt by its leading man to be more than his been pigeonholed to be as an actor so far.2 ½ father and son bar fights out of 5",Braven
11,pmtelefon,Solid action flick,8,26 December 2020,"I started watching ""Braven"" with a slight chip on my shoulder. I only have room for one ponytail wearing action star and his name is Steven Seagal. So, shame on me, I was going to make Jason Momoa earn his keep in this movie. And you know what? He does and in a major way. ""Braven"" hits the ground running and never lets go. Jason Momoa is a strong lead and the rest of the cast is also very good, especially Garret Dillahunt. Dillahunt is excellent as the villain. This movie has a good story and terrific location photography. I was on board every step of the way with ""Braven"" and plan on watching it again real soon.",Braven
12,kirbylee70-599-526179,MAMOA IN THE MOUNTAINS,9,2 May 2018,"While he had roles in a few TV series, STARGATE among them, it wasn't until 2011 that actor Jason Mamoa broke out and caught the eye of fans around the world. That was the year that he starred in the retelling of Conan as well as his role in the HBO series GAME OF THRONES. This past year he took on the role of Aquaman in JUSTICE LEAGUE and will have a solo movie as the character next year. The nice thing is that in the time he spent as a bit player up till his starring roles you can watch the journey he's taken towards leading man status. This week we have him as the main star in BRAVEN.Mamoa is Joe Braven, the current head of a family owned logging business. He lives in town with his wife Stephanie (Jill Wagner), young daughter Charlotte (Sasha Rossof) and his father Linden (Stephen Lang). A dedicated family man he and his wife work opposite shifts not just to have two incomes but so that one of them can be there to keep their eye on his father. This strong man who once ran the business Joe handles now is suffering from dementia, enhanced when he crashed a helicopter the year before.The dementia is bad enough that one night Linden walks out of the house to a nearby bar asking a young woman to leave with him thinking she's his wife. The girl's date take offense and he and his friends begin beating on Linden before Joe, called in by the bar's owner, gets there to take them on himself. When the police show they find the group handled by Joe but don't press charges against him or his father. The doctor suggest they get full time help for him.As all of this is going on Weston (Brendan Fletcher), a driver for the Braven business, is taking a load of freshly cut trees to a nearby town. To make extra money he's agreed to pick up extra logs containing drugs, working with a low level dealer named Hallett (Zahn McClarnon). A blow out sends the truck and the logs off the road and the pair pack the drugs up in duffle bags before the police can get there. Weston knows that the Bravens have a cabin nearby and suggest they store the drugs there. Hallett calls into the man he works for, Kassen (Garrett Dillahunt), who gathers his men and heads to their location.Joe and his wife have discussed the situation with his father and while she stays home with Charlotte the pair head to the cabin to shut it up for the season. In reality Joe wants time alone with his father to talk about his condition and to make the difficult decision of what to do about his failing mental capabilities. Once they get there they find that Charlotte has stowed away wanting to go along on the trip. They also find the drugs left in the cabin.Heading into town it happens to be just as Kassen and his men have shown up and shut down the road heading to the cabin where they show demanding the drugs. Knowing that once they have them they'll be killed, Joe and Linden must do what they can to survive and to protect Charlotte. The siege is on and the battle for their lives begins.The plot of the movie is simple in structure and has been done before. What makes it different here is the added complication of Linden's fall into dementia. He's there at times but drifts off at others. And yet Joe must count on him and his skills with a rifle to help him if they want to survive. Another difference between most films of this sort is the arrival of Stephanie who helps take on the bad guys from the outside. So instead of the stalwart hero we're used to we now have an elderly man and an empowered woman in the mix. And it works excellently.While all of these characters play their part there are three main roles that it all circles around. Mamoa shows that he's been working on his acting ability. He handles the physical aspects well and is certain to enjoy a successful career as an action star. Lang could have drawn all attention to himself in his performance here but instead shows he's a giving actor providing a fantastic supporting role to Mamoa. Dillahunt's performance as Kassan is subtle and brutal, from his smashing in the face of a dealer who works for him when we first see him to the military like precision he commands those under him as they attempt to take the cabin.There are plenty of action films that come and go, too many to count. Most of them offer a decent night's entertainment but few offer an actor whose star is on the cusp of rising like Mamao's is. Watching this film in addition to his other offerings shows he has the potential to become a top star. Couple that with his humble behavior on talk shows he's visited and one can only wish him well. BRAVEN is a step in the right direction and for action fans a movie to enjoy right now.",Braven
13,peterp-450-298716,Momoa looking impressive in a not so impressive movie.,5,20 March 2018,"""You know if you give the other half,
we're as good as dead.""I've read an article somewhere titled: ""10 Reasons why you should watch Braven"". I agreed with a few points. You could say the movie is a retrospective of action films from the 90s. But there are reasons enough to simply skip this mediocre action film (for you to discover these reasons while reading). It's not because Jason Momoa became known to the wider public as ""Aquaman"" that you can call this film successful. Personally, I thought he was superb in ""The Bad Batch"". And even in the ridiculously bad movie ""Wolves"" he was the one who impressed me the most. Most probably because of his impressive muscles and those special colored eyes. But even those hypnotic eyes can't really improve a movie like ""Braven"".In ""Braven"" Momoa plays the robust owner of a logging company, Joe Braven. And with that, the title of this film is explained allready. Joe is a good-hearted man who's concerned about the welfare of his employees. He's a true family man who truly loves his wife Stephanie (Jill Wagner) and adores his daughter Charlotte (Sasha Rossof). And then there's his father Linden (Stephen ""The monkey's paw"" Lang) who shows signs of Alzheimer's so he doesn't find the Christmas lights and thinks strange women are his dead wife. And that's the source of misery. The moment Joe decides to go to their isolated mountain cabin with his father to discuss possible options, he doesn't realize that some obscure drug gang is using this hut as a storage for a significant amount of drugs.One thing certainly isn't missing in ""Braven"". And that's the aspect of predictability. The fact that Joe and his father are present the moment this drug gang tries to recover their goods, isn't exactly a surprise. Also Joe's daughter Charlotte belonging to that group of stubborn teenage daughters, is something you could expect. And that stubbornness also kicks in at the least favorable moment, so Charlotte is also present during the confrontation. Not problematic enough yet? Trust me, Joe's wife Stephanie also has a membership card from the club ""wifes-who-always-show-up-at-the-wrong-time"". Fortunately, Stephanie excells in the Olympic discipline of archery.There are also a lot of what-the-hell moments. Father Braven suffers from delusions and forgets a lot, but appears to function well when he's under pressure. Fortunately he wasn't delirious during the confrontation and started to think that one of the gang members was his son. That would be rather problematic. I also found the fact that a hair band gave Kassen immediate insight, rather impressive. And then there was that nonchalant thrown down knife. Hold on tight. Although this was an immense forest, the one who it was intended for actually found it. Rather ridiculous. Especially when you see the same guy bumping into a tree just before that. After which he looks at it in a surprised way, thinking ""What's this tree doing here in this forest ..."". Hilarious.""Braven"" isn't really bad. But you won't be blown away by this clichéd action movie either. Even the use of an axe on fire, won't get you ecstatic. Ultimately, you can only conclude that thousands of such films have already been made. To finish on a positive note. Garret Dillahunt can join the group of most intriguing badguys in film history. A cruel person who smashes someone's head and looks at everyone with an apathetic gaze. Indeed a psychopathic figure. But just like the rest of the film, not really innovative and far from intelligent.",Braven

15,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Braven,5,8 February 2018,"Braven (my latest write-up) is low on plot, low on horse sense, and short on serviceable editing. Its star (Jason Momoa) was in Justice League but this is not the vehicle that anoints him to A-list status. As far as 2018's releases go, Braven feels like a mash-up of Assault on Precinct 13, Cliffhanger, and 1981's Death Hunt. It may be akin to those films as a dead heated, status quo. Nevertheless, I can't quite recommend Braven. Yes it has moments of survival that are relentless and inventive. Still, its residue is wholly stock. Braven sadly veers into direct-to-video territory.Braven is about one man protecting his family (grandfather, daughter, and wife). Its title comes from the name of the main character (Jason Momoa as Joe Braven). Momoa meets the physical demands of the role, looks like an out of place Adonis, and has a screen presence that is functional. His Joe is a brute, hard-working logger with I guess, a special set of skills (Liam Neeson was unavailable being in The Commuter and all). Joe finds an immense stash of cocaine in his cabin. It has been left there by drug runners for safe keeping (one of said drug runners is Joe's insipid co-worker). They come to claim it and so begins a standoff between good and evil. Braven the movie relies heavily on merciless violence, beautified Canadian backdrops (impersonating the state of Washington), father/son conflicts, and bulletproof logistics. Protagonists and antagonists get shot at but never seem to die or feel any morbid pain. Axes, demise by fire, and mountainous falls take care of that. All in all, Braven clocks in at ninety-four fast-paced minutes. Its action sequences veer between pedestrian and exhaustion-filled. Lin Oeding's spraying direction is standard fare. This is despite the reliable Stephen Lang, the damsel Jill Wagner, and the cold-blooded Garret Dillahunt being added to the cast. Bottom line: Braven as a gelid weather thriller, may give motion junkies their diverted, rental fix. In my mind though, it isn't really worth ""braving"". Rating: 2 stars.",Braven
16,shakercoola,Visceral 80s style actioner in a wonderful wintry wilderness,6,1 September 2018,"An action thriller with adequate performances. It has a 'Cliffhanger' style survival and last stand storyline which is entertaining with good tension. The dialogue is sickly sweet early on with lots of ""I love you"" exchanges up and down the nuclear family but once the action ensues it is unpretentious with minimal narrative. The end scene is as protracted as the equipment our hero uses to thwart the murderous villain, but they had the sense to roll to credits and not go over things and find meaning.

He doesn't want to put his father in an assisted living facility and he is really struggling with the decision he has to make. However, his father is the least of his concerns once he finds a large amount of drugs hidden on his property and the man it belongs to wants it back.This was a decent low budget film. I thought the acting was good and I liked the story. I think it needed more depth. Something that kinda bothered me was the way the gang of drugsters were interacting with each other like they were mercenaries.

There is the set up where we see the hero who is usually lily white, a loving dad, a caring husband, etc. Then we have a completely one-dimensional villain who beats a puppy to death with a shovel or something of that nature just to show the audience that he is evil to the core. Then the fecal matter hits the fan and only one man makes it out alive. And guess who that man is? Yep, it's always the hero because anything remotely resembling a surprise is out of the question. Whatever is thrown at us in the form of a story is always too stupid to even discuss. This story takes place in the middle of nowhere in the snowy mountains yet for some reason there is a thriving drug trade going on. I suppose they are selling the drugs to Eskimos and hunters in an area that probably has one person for every 20 square miles. Evil man beats another man (perhaps to death?) in a restaurant full of people, also known as eye witnesses.

You do get what you paid for - a fast action thriller with a medium amount of bloodletting and no ridiculous lovey-dovey scenes to slow everything down.There were some major holes, like Dementia Dad suddenly knowing full well how to use a powerful sniper's rifle. Mrs. Braven's adept and skillful use of her bow and arrows is forgiven since they showed, at the top of the film, that she is well-practiced for this.I thought the movie was cool.

29,trinaboice,While we wait for Aquaman,5,20 February 2018,"Grade: CRating: R, 94 minutesIn a Nutshell: 
Directed by Lin Oeding, this Canadian action flick is all testosterone.Nothing like a relaxing winter day at the cabin. Ha ha My dad has a cabin in the mountains near Park City, so I kept imagining what we would have done if we had been in the same situation. Die a horrible death, most likely.
Tips for parents: 
Some profanity, including TONS of F-bombs.
Lots of brutal fighting.
Some bloody, gory deaths.
You see Jason Momoa shirtless.Uplifting theme: 
Needed supplies at your cabin: ammo, guns, knives, bear trap, bow & arrow, a PHONE!
Family
Don't do drugs.
 Things I liked:
Beautiful scenery and wildlife.
Wow, Jason Momoa is HUGE. He even makes Stephen Lang look small in comparison. Until an AquaMan feature film from the Justice League comes to the big screen, I'm happy to see him in anything. It's fun to watch him kick bad-guy butt, but otherwise, the movie isn't very good. Did you know he's married to the petite Lisa Bonet?
 
Things I didn't like:
Dumb dialogue.
Some silly choices that make you scratch your head.
I really liked Garret Dillahunt in the TV sitcom Raising Hope: Season 1 by Fox, so it's hard for me to take him seriously in a drama.",Braven

So how'd Jason do, walking tall in the footsteps of so many extraordinary hometown heroes? Pretty well, I think. He makes the effort to distinguish himself, particularly, shedding his Aquaman physique, owning his heft, as most true Canadian woodsmen do, almost stumbling while walking and galloping instead of running, punctuated with gasps and grunts associated with the reality of moving such body bulk. one feels the sheer physical power corporally and viscerally. He manages the old dad-son chestnut well, constantly switching good cop to bad and back, with heartfelt pain and admiration for his father and former custodian now become his custodial charge. His interaction with the daughter is warm and easy,, and his very brief interactions with the wife, were exceptionally natural and matter-of-fact, all the while conveying the joy of true lovemates for life, .

31,danielmanson,It's a good movie. Has it's flaws though,7,25 April 2020,"Want to start by saying it's a good film and well worth watching in my opinion. The action/fight scenes are great, plot is easy to understand, acting is good and overall just a nice watch.It does have its flaws, like every other film, though. I thought the characters would make annoying decisions which were purely made to keep the story going. Too many instances the character wouldn't pick up the gun when it's right there etc. There was a few little things as well in regards to the plot. I'll name one that's not a spoiler. So the father has a sniper pointing out a window at one stage and nobody can see it for ages. How I do not know! Things that annoy, but don't ruin the film in anyway.Overall it's a good watch in total. If you like action films you will probably like this one.",Braven

Lots of interesting moments, you won't get bored. I would totally rated it 8/10 if not for the last 5 minutes. That last fight was too over the top for me.

35,stevenrotherforth,A grounded believable action movie until it goes over the edge!,7,1 September 2018,"BravenBraven is one of those rare action movies that remains mostly grounded and believable.
A simple story of a Logger who must defend his family from a group of drug runners.
Michael Nilon and Thomas Pa'a Sibbett's script builds some likeable and conceivable characters. 
The Braven family work on screen because of the chemistry of the actors.
Both leading men Jason Momoa and Stephen Lang add a sense of depth to what would usually be a run of the mill action yarn.
Lang in particular is excellent as a man on the verge of breaking point as he tries to come to terms with dementia.
His son Joe Braven played by Momoa is also a highlight as he struggles to do what is right by his ailing father.When drug runners stash a large shipment of narcotics in the Braven families holiday cabin this tale becomes a fight for survival as the bad guys simply won't let the Braven's walk away now that they are involved.
With a slender runtime of 1hr 34mins it is quite commendable how Director Lin Oeding has managed to develop the characters and the story. 
This film never out stays it's welcome even if some character development is questionable.
All the Bravens seem to possess a certain set of skills. 
Skills that make them a nightmare for people like those pesky drug runners.
The problem is, it's never explained why or how they are such a bad ass family.
You or I would probably pee our pants in such a scenario but not the Bravens. They truly are brave ones!
It's obvious that the Bravens can hunt and have a knowledge on how to survive in the wilderness. This is due to the harsh environment in which they live but they all seem to be trained to military level in the ass kickery department.
Even Mrs Braven ( Jill Wagner) shows up wielding a bow and arrow in a way that would put Lara Croft to shame.
This is not a criticism more of a observation that was probably explained but left on the cutting room floor.
I feel this film could have gone even deeper with the fleshing out of its characters. That said the characters are still one of the movies strongest points.Fight scenes look authentic as do some of the gruesome ways in which characters meet their demise.
Momoa is not a superhero here.
He bleeds and takes a beating just like the rest of us.
I had a good time watching Braven because the action scenes were all mostly plausible.
Only the climatic scene went over the edge.
Villains are nicely handled too.
Garret Dillahunt plays the lead bad guy and it's apparent to all he's loving it too.
He's menacing, evil, a right nasty piece of work. All the more reason to root for the Bravens.
As a technical achievement this movie is pleasant to look at.
Cinematography is nicely handled. The opening titles and musical score are both soothing.
A calm before the storm if you like.
Sadly this movie probably won't be remembered in ten years time, but when Jason Momoa's career enters a new stratosphere due to the likely success of Aquaman.
It will be nice to look back and remember some of the best action movies are the simplest ones with real heart.",Braven
36,projectsgamer,Braven,6,9 April 2021,Braven Was not that good of a movie I was interested in what this was about all I knew there was action which there is and it is very slow at times Which makes the movie boring u are not interested in any other characters That is all that this movie is about I give Braven an D-,Braven
37,ritera1,Strikingly poor,3,24 November 2018,"Just generally dull, dull, dull. Why? Coming up on a big movie like Aquaman, why would Momoa need to do a pile of luke warm water like this? And the other two, Lang and Dillahunt. They are good actors. Jobs are so scarce you need to do this? And the long, lingering shots of whatever arctic tundra they filmed it in. An easy mark for even the worst cinematographer and they were kind of dull, too.I don't expect much from Momoa. He can't do much except be big and...big. He was servicable in this, once the action started, which was very deep into this very short film. The McGyver aspects were silly, though. The end with the bear trap was clever. But didn't make any sense that he conveniently had all this stuff within arms reach and it was exactly what he needed.It had to have been about 45 minutes until anything really started to get going; and had very little do do with the first 44 minutes. The father's alzhimer's was a elogated melodramatic tearjerker that even Lang really couldn't do anything with. Then was largely forgotten by the end when he's stabbed and could only gurgle his last words to his son, who's just a sitting duck for Dillahunt's bad guy.The bad guy's were the most devoted goons I've ever seen in movies. Likely because the producers were too cheap to hire anybody else to get killed. Absurd.I was surprised to see that the director was a former stuntman. Usually when it's a stuntman, the action is pretty good. This was awkward and clunky. Hopefully for him it was because the producers were extremely cheap and didn't give him the time to do this properly. I focus also on the lingering shots of vehicles speeding here and there, vehicles pulling up, people leisurly exiting, a great deal of lingering shots of people running, yaddayaddayadday.Was not a fan of making a little girl climb a very high rock or two.A special embarassing treat was the fire that started in the wood cabin and uniformally burned for 20 minutes in both windows without spreading.I'm thinking this was some sort of tax write off, like the other thing Momoa was part of: Once Upon a Time in Venice.I'm always fascinated by all these feeble outings that are too plentiful. And how they come to be. Things that Lundgren, Van Damme, Cage and even now Cusack make a living off of. There might be some sort of aspiration to make art of some sort. A love of the movies. But they all fail in all the same budget-conscious way.It's much easier to believe they're all some sort of easy money scam to sell filler for Netflix and Amazon.",Braven
38,WalkdenEntertainment,Be Braven!,5,9 January 2019,"Joe Braven (Jason Momoa) is a manager and owner of a wood logging company. He comes home from work to his wife, daughter and his father, who lives with his family. It is shortly discovered that Joe's father is suffering with dementia and is struggling to accept it. Joe makes the decision to take his father to his nearby family cabin in the woods where he can discuss his father's situation further in private, but also take the time out together as father and son.After settling into the cabin, Joe and his father discover drugs that have been hidden in the cabin, and a group of men arrive at his front door seeking it (one of them also works with Joe...). Joe has just walked into drug operation that now requires him to stand up and defend his father and his family.Needless to say, Braven is easily classed as a B Grade film given the style and quality. In fact, I go as far to say that at times it even felt like a good old midday movie, or direct to digital. Nevertheless, Braven is brainless fun.Most movie lovers would have seen this type of film before. Our hero protects the ones he loves, and is up against a group of baddies with no phone and only a handful of weapons around him. The movie follows the typical cliche routine where the Baddies like to split up in different directions, which also allows our hero Braven to try and take out the enemies one by one.The film's biggest credit is Jason Momoa (aka Braven). As the lead star of the film, I found his character rather believable as a father and a protector of his family. Even some of action stunts in this film are enjoyable and impressive. It's the other characters surrounding him in this film that are the biggest weakness.As for film's the action scenes, they are done well, but simple shots such as man walking down a street suffer from lengthy shots and also feel like they were done with a cheap shaky- cam. Filming moments like these can be distracting, but then again, when you're filming in snow... that is the challenge.Overall, Braven is a B Grade which shows more positive factors than negative and more positives than many other films being produced today. The film's biggest strength is the lead player Jason Momoa. Many action scenes by Jason are also fun and entertaining. The film's surrounding characters, however, are a put off, along with cliche. Braven is entertaining, and even more so if you share it with the right group of friends in your movie room.5.3/10

39,elliotte2,Enjoyable action flick.,6,4 September 2018,"It is a very traditional action flick, but holds up better against most others.PROs:
1. Nice scenary, and even better that it is real outdoors with real snow, it makes a real difference.
2. Acting is very very well done especially by standards of action movies. While the bad guys were cookie-cutter, the protagonist and his family had people that could actually say lines and make them belivable. Movie does a very good job in character development, getting an idea of their family life prior to when the action takes over. Momoa is a rare big action guy who able to display the range of emotions necessary.
3. Direction: Well done, one of the things that irritate me about action movies is when it seems the characters forgets to act scared or director shoots scenes where there is no tension even though bullets are flying(like Marvel movies, world is ending and people making jokes). Here, Momoa emotions never betray the fact that he is scared for his life, scared for his family and pissed off at the men doing this. This is what real people who do. CONs:
1. Villains are pretty generic, never got a full understanding of their motivations. Example, we never know how much money is involved to give reason why this was so important for them.
2. Some injuries should have had a bigger impact on the characters than they did. People with injuries were fighting at full level(a constant gripe about almost all action movies).Overall, this is a overall enjoyable action movie.",Braven

46,TheRadiobox,"Hardly brave in its ideas, but solid in its execution",7,19 November 2021,"Braven was directed by Lin Oeding, written by Thomas Pa'a Sibbett and stars Jason Momoa, Garret Dillahunt, Stephen Lang, Sasha Rossof, Jill Wagner, Zahn McClarnon, and Brendan Fletcher. It follows a family man as he deals with drama between said family and faces off with a group of drug runners over a mix-up involving cocaine.The Plot: Braven's core is largely familiar stuff, a handful of common action movie setups and tropes rolled into one that realistically shouldn't work as efficiently as it does. Nothing is reinvented or revolutionized aside from a more unique setting than these one-man-army movies are accustomed to, but the writers do a damn good job at keeping things interesting and marginally different.Joe Braven (Momoa, sporting a sick last name) is the blue-collar hero dealing with plenty of issues, most pressing of which is his father Linden's (Lang) brain injury, causing him to get into scuffles around town. Joe takes his wife Stephanie (Wagner), Linden, and, unintentionally, the couple's daughter Charlotte (Rossof) to the family cabin to discuss options. While all this is going on, truck driver and employee of Joe, Weston (Fletcher) is asked by Hallett (McClarnon), a runner for drug trafficker Kassen (Dillahunt), to work for Kassen. Once Weston tries transporting product, drugs are spilled and must be stored at the currently empty cabin. You can see where this is going but the movie gets to its destination with ease, an unusual dramatic element in Linden's injury, and some added tension since it isn't Joe's actions that caused any of this. It's a standoff from there, the Bravens don't want what they have but Kassen thinks otherwise, sending his goons to take back their product. Braven becomes a siege-style movie that never slips up in its setup due to the common plot threads being simple to pull off, but efficient and simple are all the movie had to be to be good.The Characters: Keeping with the tropes, Braven's characters (especially its antagonist) should be familiar to anyone who has seen even just a handful of action movies.Joe is a badass family man trying to maintain that title while under the tremendous stress of owning a logging company, raising his daughter, pleasing his wife, and supervising his dad. While other movies might've played into the idea of Joe being a superhero because of his sheer physical strength and seemingly perfect life, Braven grounds Joe the best it can with the number of real issues plaguing him to a far more sympathetic result. Stephanie is the voice of reason around the house, talking to Joe about the problems he faces and always offers solutions. Again, that's far from unheard of in these types of movies but she isn't useless throughout the runtime, occasionally supplying more tangible help to Joe and Linden once Kassen makes his demands, which is more than most significant others in action movies get. Charlotte gets far less, only really existing to meet conventions and get in trouble, still the other characters make her feel more authentic and necessary to the plot than she is. Linden is a great addition to the cast, adding more emotion to the family and to the action by way of his lapsing memory. He's clearly his father's son, a hard man with a heart of gold, observational ability, and strength to spare and Lang steals the show in the role.Kassen and his goons aren't fantastic in their roles and are mostly just archetypes of action movie bad guys, but Kassen does get the opportunity to impress with his intuition abnormal for his type and his coldness that switches at a moment's notice to vivid brutality without ever coming off as showboat-y. He's easy to hate and gets the job done well, as do all of the characters.The Action: Like a lot of recent burgeoning action/thriller directors, Oeding comes from a stuntman background which gives him an edge in staging his fights. His shootouts don't fare the same way though, often times they become interchangeable with numerous other offerings that use the same camera techniques and equipment with equally passable outcomes. It's when Oeding gets the opportunity from Sibbett's script to get inventive that the movie's action really shines, with the action echoing pictures like Assault on Precinct 13 and even Home Alone with Joe's implementation of traps and usage of the environment more than the Commando's and Rambo's that clearly left an imprint on the creators.Joe and Linden get plenty of creative kills using things like bows and arrows and fire pokers that, again, never feel like the characters revel in the pain; only using what they have out of necessity. Something that's always appreciated in a movie is when the main character's profession comes into play during the action, even if it's only once or twice instead of throughout the runtime; and Joe does have some uses for his axe-swinging abilities and inclement driving skills that never seem out of place for his character. While some of the sequences can feel a little uninspired in their execution and Charlotte's place in the action boils down to the child-in-peril cliché, Braven does have a unique setting and tools for its characters to use.The Technics: For a first outing as a director, Oeding does very well in setting up his scenes, characters, and tension. None of Braven is perfect but the helmer does work hard to give audiences what they came for while opting to make his setup and story more interesting than most.There were wise decisions made in picking the crew, with cinematographer Brian Andrew Mendoza taking advantage of the setting and the director's acquaintance with action movie making, always keeping the action sequences intelligible and the scenery beautiful. Set decoration by Duane Chard is also very good, making the cabin feel lived in instead of a cheap set for low-budget kinetics. The pacing can sag from time to time though, and the music isn't as active as the rest of the movie, but Braven is a solid first foray into direction.Oeding's outing is a solid one, doing most things very well while never breaking molds. Joe is a great leading character, as are Linden and Kassen; and they carry the action and story heartily. Braven is hardly a phenomenal movie but it's a fun watch from a crew that clearly has a future.73/100.",Braven

However, my first look at Jason Momoa since GoT and pleasantly suprised. He's not wooden, he's not typecast, and I found his acting to be naturally innocent. He seemed scared and got on with what he needed to do rather than cocksure and arrogant as is the norm for this type of movie.It's not an Oscar winner I wouldn't have thought, but one thing I loved was the snow.

48,elenaphysics,Decent movie,9,9 May 2019,"This is a movie that has been done again and again in the past.
A bunch of criminals want to kill an innocent family.
The plot is simple, the acting is simple,the character development is not existent and the bad guy in the movie is a total idiot( so the criminal mastermind opponent is off the table) but the adventure is real.
It has some serious logical errors.There are people in it who seem to be undead.
They get shot,stabbed,axed or even crossbowed and they keep going.
The things that make Braven a good movie is that it is not gore or scary.
I really hate those home invasion movies where kids get hurt or killed.
It is intense,it has great cinematography. I really enjoyed watching Jason Momoa running in the woods like a snow leopard.
Ok this made me sound like a person who has no idea about movies. But seriously, Jason's fans will enjoy the movie a lot.
Sometimes a movie doesn't have to be something unique or special to be good.
This movie is what it is.An action movie about a man who would do anything to protect his family. I did not expect to watch something phenomenal. I wanted to have a good time watching a movie.

If you want to do that type of application, then watch an action-thriller or action-drama instead. This movie is for people who just want to sit in their seats, just relax, chill and enjoy an entertaining film. Jason Momoa, alias the Aqua-Man does exactly that in this movie.Jason plays a logger who uncovers the crooked methods that some drug transporters use to smuggle drugs in hollow logs. The events that follow after that are Hollywood-history ; Jason stages a one-man army battle against the baddies. The muscular Momoa fits the role perfectly and makes it seem believable at least, thanks to his great physique. I hope brother Jason gets to do more solo action hero movies with a more refined and intelligent story than this one.

Unfortunately, one of his buddies has stashed a large quantity of drugs he's smuggling in the cabin and the owners of the drugs come looking for it. This leads to a standoff between Braven, his dad, his daughter, and the drug dealers.There is not a lot of new ground covered here. Still, the action is tense, the characters are appealing, and the plot never lets up. Mamoa has a certain screen presence that women adore and men admire.

65,fxdx4,They don't make em like this anymore - An unnecessary Indi action dude.,5,18 April 2018,"There is nothing inherently wrong with Braven. It's just that there is nothing really good about it either. I like Jason Momoa, and Stephan Lang is good in everything he is in, and the simple premise of the film I hoped would lead to a focus on action and maybe a good script. The plot, as it is, is that Braven (Momoa) and his dad go up to close the cottage for the year, only to find there are stacks of drugs hidden in their cottage. Scores of baddies want their drugs back, and of course the only way to do that is to murder everyone in the house. Ohh yeah, Braven's girl is around too for some reason that is never really important. The product however is a shockingly generic movie, with a very lazy script, an impossibly cliche villain, and very average action scenes. We get glimpses of character of Braven (Momoa), his wife and ailing (Lang), but they never stand out of shine in any way. If there was a Google app to create cliche, this is it. But, going into this film, my expectations are low, so even without character, or plot I'm still ok. What is disappointing, is the action and action scenes. They lack consistency, or tension, they often are poorly, or at least very boringly choreographed and often just don't make a lot of sense. The classic example being the Van Dame movies where he would knock out a guard leaving the guard's gun sitting there for no reason other than they wanted martial arts scenes, not shoot outs. To a lesser extent, this happens several times in this film. The film kind of flops along, with no real increase in tension, and nothing really interesting happening. Even the final battle is underwhelming. Snooze. What is does have going for it is some lovely scenery (which they really needed to make a larger part of the film), a charismatic lead in Momoa, and a bare minimum of entertainment value to hold my interest to the end of the film.The score is 5/10 with a sigh.",Braven

Then the drug dealers turn up and want to kill his son and the old man. The old man shoots it out and kills a number until he is hit and later stabbed to death.

Also there is a scene where both Momoa and a villain were thrown off a cliff because the villain was dragged by a running snow vehicle and he dragged Momoa with him. It ends as Momoa plunged into the sea while the villain landed on a rock near shore. If anything, the law of physics dictates the momentum of the vehicle will drag the villain further away, therefore he should land in water while Momoa being the one smashed onto that rock ... but as many other twists in this movie, the law of physics simply don't apply.It's an OK movie, nothing spectacular.",Braven

Ironically, the (literally) brain-damaged character and a child make the most reasonable decisions. Maybe it's a social commentary... nah. But it's not the end of the story. Fortunately, characters' really disturbing suicidal tendencies pick up the pace later on, and we get a very silly action movie that takes itself quite seriously.The story isn't a strong point here, but rather the style (snow, bows and axes) or rather their clash (vs ultra-modern looking carbines).

It is amazing that when the final edit was done and they had a screening that those involved did not think for a moment to reshoot the terrible action scenes.

Writing = c+
Acting = b -
Setting, scenery = A
I think it should be noted that as long as violence (the kind where there is profuse, but not excessive, blood) is not off the table when it comes to watching ""action"" films and the like with your family (kids, or senior range parents, or both) then this might be one to keep on the back-burner when you're in a pinch for an indoor weekender. While there is absolutely no sex, or nudity, the vulgarity is at an almost non existent minimal and of the variety that might even pass the t.v. Censors these days. As the summaries and trailer imply, drugs are at the forefront of the plot device that fuels this slow burning, up hill rolling 'action' film, but are not used/abused by any of the characters and barely seen throughout the movie.No, it won't win any/many awards and you'll probably have to strain to remember you even saw it within a few months time, but for all its shortcomings it looks well produced (aesthetically speaking) and once the action does get going it stays at a nominal and steady pace up to the end. You could do worse than this b grade ""action"" story about a good-hearted family man dealing with his own family issues whose world is suddenly turned upside down through no fault of his own.

They have to become superheroes, and this is (almost) what happens in the second half of the movie. There is no more suspense, no more waiting, no more fear... The bad guys are just passive victims, waiting to be killed, and Braven seems to ask himself one single thing : how am I going to find the most complicated way to kill them all ?

It was a shame the drone operators weren't credited, but I digress.A number of important elements make a movie that engages the audience. As revenge movies go (Taken, et al), all important aspects were well executed: gritty and believable acting, appropriate music, tack sharp editing, and obviously great directing... the plot maintained perfect pace and story arc right to the end.The story has a predictable conclusion, but getting there is a good ride thanks to great collaboration and synergy by cast, crew, pre and post-production, and, well... the scenery.Two thumbs up.",Braven

Not a great movie but not as ridiculous as many seem to feel.Now there is definitely some dumb stuff but a lot of that's my particular sensibilities so perhaps others won't be bothered. I don't expect gun details to bother everyone for example. But oh boy, there's some stupid moves. The boss bad guy goes up and takes ""a sniper position"" with a pistol smh. Sure it was in a carbine shell thingy but it's just silly. Though to be fair said sniper position ends up being about 50ft away across level ground so yeah. And there's a henchman running around w/the charging handle on his rifle hanging out the back but it's brief. It all pretty much falls into the category of technical mistakes and/or sub-optimal decision making from the good guys.Well, the whole bear trap thing...anywayMistakes aside there are some pretty good scenes. I didn't find the non-gun stuff bad at all. And the protagonist isn't supposed to be some specialist, he's a logger. So I can forgive some poor decision making. If you can tough it out to the end there's some entertaining bad guy dispatching to be seen.Oh yeah, somehow Garret Dilahunt (sorry, I'm not looking up the correct spelling) for once isn't especially creepy or annoying, loathsome, etc. Took me by surprise. He always creepy. In Deadwood he managed to be two creepy guys. Not saying I don't like him, just usually weirder.Anyway, decent Netflix level movie.",Braven

Also last scene where police backup arrives and they run through forrest to find bad guys, they don't know how many nad guys is still out there, they have their guns drawn and are all on high alert but believe it or not main character's child daughter and wife are walking with cops and leading the chase instead of staying somewhere safe because dozen murderers were trying to kill them.

124,IliescuVictor,Home Alone action in the winter,5,12 February 2018,"One of the biggest flaws of this movie, as many others stated before me, is the bad writing. I won't go into details but this movie will make you wonder if the characters on screen have any brains at all. 
Yes, the director is at his first directing role but still, that doesn't give you permission to write a weak scenario.
Basically the whole action is similar to Assault on precinct 13 or Home Alone for that matter: some bad guys trying to get inside a house and they have a hard time achieving that goal. 
The acting is weak as well but decent at times. Jason Momoa fails to deliver a role that was designed to be badass but clearly is not, although he has the weight of the whole movie bearing on his shoulders. Stephen Lang isn't something spectacular as well. As for the rest of the cast, well, it felt like they were rookies at this.
The scenery is great, perhaps the only good thing about this movie but the bad writing stands out the most. Many action scenes are filled with stupidity, especially the decisions that Jason's character does. 
All in all, this is a poor attempt at what could've been a better action movie if directed by someone with a little more experience. It's too long and it made be to fast forward for most of the time. Wouldn't recommend watching it more than once.",Braven

Harry Potter could point a wand at this film and shout, ""riddikulus!"" just to infuse some realism into this mess. There were some instances were the main character could have overcame his enemies with his strength or the use of guns lying around but he would take time to heat steel and clamp this on the neck of a shotgun-wielding henchman and most ridiculous of all was his prophetic sense of setting up a bear trap and safety-roping himself to wrestle and body-throw the main antagonist from a cliff and him dangling with leg tendons strained by the bear trap.",Braven

Anyone watching an action movie that isn't Bond or Bourne and is expecting great acting is setting themselves up for failure, and I feel like this is what is happening with the reviewers bashing this movie. They want this to be Dunkirk, or Bourne, or Saving Private Ryan, or one of those classic action movies. Let's face it, most action movies are even trying to be that, and this one definitely isn't.As far as this movie, I think the reviewers are right for the scenery, it is beautiful. I totally agree with those comments. Some of the actions scenes are a little corny, but sometimes that is what you want in an action movie.

Good movie for a evening on TV.I want to say this is down to earth action, meaning it has some realism, which I like in the times of all many big surreal action movies, but then that doesn't quite fit, as it has some typical action scenes.
I think the roles fit quite well in the setting, Jason Momoa and Stephen Lang are these rough looking guys.
Jason Momoa has done very well in his caarer I think, escaping TV series into bigger movies, but he just can't quite capture my attention. I don't think it's because he is not able to, it's just the story and how the script is, and where the focus is.
I think it is regular guys VS some stereotypical badass evil guys who could be straight out of the Die Hard movies.
I feel there is a mismatch between the two forces and what the movie wants to be.In few scenes I think this is original and there has been attention to detail. For example a guy opens a small hatch in a door, a little later another guy comes by the door and closes that small hatch, it doesn't have any major importance, but it gets done.I think it suffers a little from bad timing, it comes in the end of many movies which also have the winter setting.

I finished the film wishing I had not persevered to the end.There is potential here, so by all means give it a shot, but if (like me) your eyebrows shoot up at how 'out of place' the first action sequence seems, then I advise you to go no further and watch something else instead.",Braven

Trying to appeal to too many people will just alienate everyone.If wanting to include interpersonal interactions, then the simple solution would have been to develop the dysfunctional bad guys better, there were two that could have stood out and made for a much better movie.Yes, some of the fight/kill scenes are ridiculous but that is what is expected and can be the fun part of this type of movie.

Jason Momoa played a decent role but the whole movie was brought down by just the complete lack of sense in any action scene. At first I thought it was a little odd but by the end of the movie I was yelling at my TV in vain hope that I could talk some sense into the protagonist! The movie plot was straight forward where the bad guys try and kill the one bad ass main character because he unknowingly came across their evil plan. I enjoyed the movie in between every fighting scene. So so so many times I was yelling for to protagonist to pick up the gun laying at your feet and shoot your attacker! Not once did any of the protagonists feel the urge to pick up any weapon that was practically thrown at their feet. Every single antagonists also felt the urge to use their weapon as a primitive club rather than shooting the main characters. Every time the enemy was vulnerable and 99 percent finished off the protagonist would simply run off into the woods all the while stumbling over the weapons they seemingly don't have a need for. Simply put, too many insanely dumb decisions in otherwise entertaining action scenes. Wish the writing was better. I can't help but imagine this scene unfolding during the filming. Jason-""So at this point I go ahead and pick up the gun and shoot this guy right?""
Director-""Nah, we need him to fumble around for the next 30 minutes.""

Jason-""......""Or this one.Jason-""So i'm about to go chase down this main bad guy and you want me to grab some rope? Even though I'm a good 100 yards behind the guy you wan't me to fumble around my shed for some rope? Then stuff it in a bag with a bear trap?""
Director-""Ya totally. Now your getting it Jason.""
Jason-""Now you want me to seemingly catch up to the main guy who is running to a nearby cliff for an apparent escape, get ahead of him undetected, then lay this rope out in front on his predictable path and when he conveniently stops near it I go full cowboy and whip it to fling snow in the air 4 feet from me to serve as a distraction from the trained pistol wielding gunman?""

Right from the start I was proven wrong. Jason Mamoa was obviously in his element in this movie. I have never seen his acting so natural and fluid. Drop the super hero badass, the big bad badass, this guy can really act! I was continually impressed with even the change in his voice. So much more natural. And he was not a badass in this movie. He takes a lot of hits. He was a man of the wilderness who used his knowledge and ingrained need to protect his family to overcome the odds. Something that anyone with those skills could do.

159,teoandreea-07655,Deliverd as expected: action; more than expected: acting,9,19 January 2020,"Before I decided to watch this movie on Netflix, I read through some of the low score reviews. So I was expecting not a bad movie, but a ridiculous bad movie.
Now that I've seen it I am actually surprised of the low reviews from some viewers.
The action scenes are as expected from action movies. Actually, I would give these 10/10 as, for a low budget movie, they are rather original and well filmed. To actually have a consensus amongst unhappy viewers that they are ridiculous is just as ridiculous in itself. This way ALL action movies are bad as, news flash for some: they exagerate for entertainment purposes :) Please don't try this at home.
Acting wise: a little better than expected. The script is not done in order to highlight acting skills but, I must say I was a little prejudiced before watching Braved due some previous Mamoa films. So I am pleased to see maybe more meaningful lines and surprisingly, a good balance of character roughness but not crossing into the lone, though, monosilabic mountain Rambo hero. Well done. For this type of movie I would give 8/10.
I loved how they filmed the scenery, the details of the falling snow and even action scenes. 10/10
Script: oh well, I do agree, it's quite weak. Does make you raise an eyebrow at times and has a slow build-up. But then again, I think the rest of the movie compensates and it doesn't alter the viewing experience too much. I believe the ""rushing through"" gaps are sort of natural considering it's an action movie, so it doesn't do very well on some character building or small dialogues. 6/10

He does emotion and upset very well and I hope he gets more roles in the future that showcase that,Braven

Was hoping to get some real good action for what it's worth, but this was just lazy writing seriously. Ok there was one part that I enjoyed also - the father-son relationship part. But now for the disliking arguments:
As I mentioned before, waaaaay to lazy writing for a movie (don't mean the dialogue part mainly, but just the culmination of events happening)Since when are drug runners like spec ops forces dudes? or sharp shooters? sry for me doesn't make any sense.After half the movie when Momoa starts killing the goons - why couldn't he carry/use the bow more? His wife in the movie was the real bow master? :D Why not kill the guy when you are running away from the bad guy and he is clearly wounded - she should know these woods there? (Assuming from the story) And does it really take this long to reload a sport bow? And as a logger/lumberjack? why couldn't he own more of those axes/hatcets, since you own a cabin in the mountains? Just adding some arguments here :DLastly the final action sequence between Momoa and Dillahunt. Why couldn't he use any stick of wood to fight him off instead of jumping to the bear trap himself. WHERE WAS HIS BOW? USE THE FRIGGIN BOW!There I think I've said it all now. These were the things that bugged me during the movie! That's why a score of 4. But if you liked it then good for you!

169,iamnaresh,"Jason Momoa stars in Braven, an axe-throwing action thriller that gets a little stuck in the snow.",7,22 March 2018,"Jason Momoa seems made for action movie stardom, and Braven is one of the smaller projects that should help Khal Drogo fans while away the time between Justice League and Aquaman. Braven is directed by Lin Oeding, whose work as a stunt coordinator certainly helped him give the movie some inventively brutal energy at key moments, and the simplicity of its premise serve it well once things get going.But Braven sure does take a while to get going. Its problems primarily lie in an unwillingness to follow the potential of its premise to a logical crescendo of ludicrous action movie serenity. Instead, there's a brutally dull and far too sincere first act, introducing us to Momoa's Joe Braven and his home life, while giving us the thinnest of setups for why such an upstanding guy would ever cross paths with the villains in the first place. That slow burn opening doesn't really fit with the brutality we get later in the movie, and Jason Momoa does a fine job with the more sensitive than you might expect tough guy Joe Braven, supervisor at a lumber yard, devoted husband, and father to a young girl. Aside from their modest family home, Joe maintains a getaway cabin up in the mountains. The problem is that his father (Stephen Lang) is suffering from symptoms that resemble early-onset Alzheimer's, and since he's still very much capable of getting himself down to the bar and blundering into trouble, that's complicating things. While you might think it would be difficult to buy Momoa's magnetic screen presence as an everyman, he's surprisingly convincing. He and Lang work well together, too, even before the bullets and axes start flying But what complicates things even further is that one of Joe's co-workers at the lumber yard is running a side business, using his rig to help run drugs for a dealer (Zahn McClarnon) who is in league with, of course, a much bigger drug kingpin (Garrett Dillahunt). When his truck runs off the road in icy conditions, he opts to store the drugs at Joe's supposedly empty cabin until they can be delivered to the big man. As you might expect, there's some confusion when Dillahunt's villain shows up to collect and finds Joe Braven, his father, and his daughter there in possession of his drugs. As you might expect, he isn't thrilled.And that's when the promised axe-throwing action begins. It takes nearly half the movie's 90 minute runtime for us to get to the action, and while there are moments of great fun, it's tough to reconcile it with so much of what came before. Dillahunt makes for a fun (if woefully underdeveloped) villain, a throwback to the kind of vintage action baddie who appears reasonable one moment while shooting one of his underlings to make a point the next. He's able to deliver lines like ""Aw, Joe, what the fuck is your problem, man?"" to amusing effect, too.But Braven never truly goes for it. Its devotion to that far too slow build early on makes you think that the violent payoff we're always waiting for is going to be more over the top than it actually is. There are some fun, creative kills (Stephen Lang's elder Braven gets in on the action with those, too), but it's never as completely bonkers as you probably expect it to be. On the other hand, there is satisfaction to be had in axes and tongs getting heated in a fireplace before they're deployed on assorted scumbags. There's some beautiful photography to be had in the snow covered mountains of Braven's Newfoundland locations, but this is no Cliffhanger. And we do indeed get to see Momoa's Joe Braven whup some serious ass in defense of his tween daughter, but this is no Commando. Momoa devotees will likely find reason to enjoy Braven, and there are certainly worse ways you can spend an hour and a half at this time of year, but this often feels like 45 minutes of story stretched to its breaking point at 90. Momoa proved with his Aquaman performance in Justice League that he can elevate a thin story with his charismatic presence, but this particular working class superhero deserves a little more to work with.",Braven

Jason Mamoa kicks ass of course and I like how other characters got a chance to shine too (his dad and wife in the movie both can hold their own). I like how alot of the bad guys are taken out, all are pretty unique and clever and it's not just a regular stab
to the neck or gunshot. Each is fairly creative to some degree. There were a couple of moments in the movie that seem to have just been in to advance the plot, mostly with how the bad guy knew certain things just by assuming it seemed to move the film along. That being said it's a solid action flick, good a night in and with some popcorn and sodie pop at the ready. If you're looking for a good action film with some touching and sensitive moments, this is for you. I watched it on amazon prime, it's free if you have it.",Braven

Before the last ""fight"" over the top of the montain, Joe Braven would clearly have at max 5 seconds of advantage to set up a trap that would take at least 2 minutes to be set in that spot, but he still does it right on time. HA! Right after, when the cops and his daughter/wife were looking after him, guess who was leading the way? Right, the little girl named Charlotte. The cops are painted as completely stupid guys in this movie.

Keep saying why isn't he picking up their assault rifles after he starts picking them off? He really likes to hurt himself I suppose. Overall it's a Pyrrhic victory.

179,ericfosterolp,Not always what you'd expect but falls FAR short of being decent.,2,24 June 2018,"After seeing the trailer for ""Braven"" it didn't inspire me to want to check it out. After seeing the ratings starting to climb on Amazon Prime Video (it was at 4 stars when I viewed the movie last week and has since dropped to 3.5) and then seeing an, at the time of my viewing, score of 6.6 on IMDB I decided to give it a fair chance. As the movie began I started to see a very tired overdone plot beginning to unfold. The, 'oh no, we need to stash our drug haul somewhere and come back for it later' routine. And of course, they stash it in what they are led to believe is a cabin that won't be in use. But, as usual, the cabin does become occupied hours later and it becomes a battle between the drug lord and his gang to get their stash back from the cabin owners.Early on we are introduced to our potential ""hero"", Joe Braven (a lack-luster, Jason Momoa whose acting leaves MUCH to be desired), and his wife, young daughter and aging father who seems to be having the onset of dementia. Now, if you are a fan of action movies of this sort you would immediately figure that at some point in the movie one of the four of them will eventually die (there's almost always a sacrifice of some sort in these tired plots to ""beef up"" our hero's rage for revenge), or possibly a hostage will be taken to start the rage. Now, I will say that I was happy to see that not all of what I was expecting to unfold did. There were a few pleasant surprises. However, those did not out-weigh the ridiculousness of the overall poor movie.THE GOOD POINTS = 
 The female lead, Braven's wife, Stephanie (Jill Wagner) and
Braven's father, Linden (Stephen Lang) gave good performances. The score was alright.THE BAD POINTS =
 Jason Momoa's acting. The unexplained reasoning for a drug lord to smuggle drugs from a mountaintop in the first place. The poorly run drug gang who could have ended everything in the blink of an eye. But of course that would have made for a very short movie. The stupidity of some of the decisions of the police and the mother towards the end of the movie. (Yeah, let's run through the mountain range with our young daughter in open view to possibly be taken out instead of keeping her in the safety of the police SUV) The mind boggling time frame edits. (how is it that two men are chasing each other at one moment within VERY close distance of one-another and then seconds later one of them reaches an area with enough time to stop, devise a plan, carry it out and then turn around to wait for the other one to catch up?)  And then, the ending confrontation. I'm not going to go into how unbelievably stupid the final ten minutes or so of this movie was because I would have to give everything away but let's just say it defies logic on SO many levels. Seeing as how this movie only mustered up a grand total $ 312,116 at the theatrical box office, and let me add that ALL of that income came from the international market, absolutely ZERO came domestically, we will, more than likely, never see a ""Braven 2"", at least let's hope not!",Braven

There are encountered by a group of dangerous drug runners led by drug lord Kassen (Garret Dillahunt). The film explosive action scenes. This isn't really slow at all. My favorite performance in the film was Garrett Dillahunt as Kassen. 
This guy is a mean f****r at you never wanna run into, especially if you owe him drugs. He shoots one of his own men in the head to prove a point. He's a guy you don't wanna mess with, especially if you owe him something. There's a violent and brutal scene that can be hard to watch as he bashes a guy's head into a napkin holder.
The performances from Jason Momoa and Garret Dillahunt are the main reasons to watch this film, can't forget about the underrated Stephen Lang performance. This guy is awesome.

Go find her.""It got worse when Braven dropped his knife in the snow as a distraction device and then climbed a tree from which he sprang on a villain with nothing but his coat.Or when he was chasing Dillahunt's character but first had to fill a duffle bag with stuff from his cabin; everything but guns and knives.Or Braven's wife being a master shot with her compound bow, but unable to place an arrow on the string at one point.

Instead, Braven resorted to outlandish, MacGyver-like ways of fighting the criminals that left my friends and I snickering.Why??

Everything was good till the action started at the cabin which was where I lost it. His dad kept sticking a snipe rifle from the second story of the cabin how didn't any of the baddies see it. His wife took down the guy that was trying to kill her daughter didn't try to kill him but just ran off when she had an advantage. At least take the gun. Too many times when they had the chance to take a gun but were like "" NO"" I think people that actually rated this movie high were just fans of Jason or just being supportivecause he produced it.

There were just so many occasions where the protagonists could have grabbed the gun or made another extremely logical/simple decision to end the crew of bad guys. I'm surprised that none of the actors (Jason, etc.) protested of the unrealistic writing. I'm sure its difficult as an actor to be forced, by the writing, to pick up an axe over the automatic weapon sitting right next to it in a scene where you're defending your dad/wife, etc. from a bunch of guys coming at you with automatic riffles.

255,hunterofclouds,"Ignore fake reviews, this movie is so bad it is funny, though not in a good way.",2,17 February 2018,"This is my very first review on this site, as I rarely feel sufficiently invested in a movie to take the time to write a significant piece on a movie. However, I had to speak out because I could not tolerate the fake reviews obviously meant to trick innocent spectators like myself. The movie started out as a decent, if by no means great or even good flick. Had it continued in such a vein, it could have earned 6, perhaps even 7 stars. After all, though the plot is all too predictable, the acting itself was not abysmal. However, all sense of normality flies out the window once you get to the action sequences. None of them make any sense whatsoever.Spoiler warning ahead.In one such example, one of the bad guys climbs up a mountain to ""snipe"" the protagonist, who is riding an ATV. Moments later, we get to see a very poorly conceived and shot scene where the camera's perspective is shown over the shooter's shoulder, who is aiming towards the fleeing protagonist. What makes this utterly ridiculous is that according to this shot the protagonist is on level ground with the shooter, and not 40 or 50 feet away from him. How did the shooter manage to close the distance so quickly, ascending then descending the mountain to cut his target off? Then, after shooting the protagonist off the ATV, the shooter inexplicably radio's one of his henchment to ""finish him off"" when he himself is almost right on top of the target.Now, when this henchman arrives at the scene the protagonist seems to have miraculously shrugged off his gunshot wound (a wound which strangely enough, though it managed to knock him off the ATV, is still notably absent and at no point in the movie seems to inconvenience him at all) somehow manages to sneak up on the big, gun-toting bad guy (though the trees are so sparse that one wonders how he managed to disguise his own footprints in the snow AND approach the gun-wielding bad guy without being spotted) and clocks him on the head with a branch - from the FRONT. I replayed this scene numerous times just to confirm that yes, according to the camera shot the protagonist's blow comes from the front and hits the bad guy on the temple/forehead. How a supposedly alert guy who is aware that his target is around manages to miss this is just ridiculous and immersion breaking.A struggle over the gun ensues, which our protagonist loses yet fortunately enough when the bad guy aims the gun and fires at him from a distance of maybe 6 feet, our nimble protagonist manages to fling himself to the ground, hiding behind the nearby ATV and thus narrowly avoiding the single shot fired by the bad guy. So, after firing a single shot with his automatic assault rifle, what does the bad guy do? Surely, take this chance to take some prudent distance while firing at his helpless foe, who still lies on the ground and is clearly visible behind the non-existent cover of the tiny ATV! Nope, instead the bad guy runs over to swing his rifle like a club at our protagonist, then proceeds to kick him. After this another small fight breaks out where the bad guy has plenty of chances to grab his gun, yet he doesn't. No, the protagonist even has all the time in the world to wrap the ATV's towing wire (which has been conveniently unwound - how did that happen?) around the bad guy's waist, then proceeds to drive the ATV over a nearby cliff.I could continue a play-by-play rundown of the endless succession of such nonsensical, immersion breaking, and just awfully planned and even more terribly shot fight scenes. I could harp on and on about the way none of the good guys seem particularly inclined to pick up any number of guns that could be easily and swiftly collected from downed enemies. They also act recklessly and foolishly, shoulder charging gun-wielding enemies while armed with nothing but a great, roaring scream that does nothing but alert the enemy of their position and intent. Yet, the very moment they momentarily overwhelm their opponent, they flee like little girls instead of taking the opportunity to finish off their downed foe or pick up the gun lying on the ground right in front of them.Don't even get me started on the final scene, where the character uses a rope as a laughably stupid and ineffective distraction (which of course, works flawlessly), then shoulder charges the gun wielding antagonist. When the poor man lies stunned on the ground, what does our brilliant protagonist do? He picks up the heavy, unwieldly bag of drugs instead of the gun, and takes off running into the woods. Of course, for some reason the bad guy doesn't shoot him in the back while laughing incredulously at his ambusher's sheer idiocy.In the end, this is an action movie with some of the most ridiculous, idiotic action scenes that I have witnessed. At first, they were frustrating and upsetting. As they simply kept piling on and on, however, me and my friends couldn't help but laugh at the characters' mind-boggling antics. Avoid this movie at all costs unless you want to see an unintentionally comical series of poorly designed and shot ""action"" scenes, very loosely tied together by a predictable, boring plot.",Braven
