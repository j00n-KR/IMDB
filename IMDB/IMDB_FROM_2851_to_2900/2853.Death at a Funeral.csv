0,MartinHafer,Great cringe-worthy comedy.,8,17 January 2015,"While I would never say that ""Death at a Funeral"" is a brilliant comedy, it certainly takes a simple idea and makes the most of it. It's the story of a funeral that ends up having just about every awful possible thing occur throughout its course. And, I love that just when you can't imagine it getting any worse, it does! It's the sort of thing that is great fun to watch but thank goodness it's not happening to people you know and love! Now not everyone likes a comedy like this--my wife surely would have cringed repeatedly through the course of this movie. But I loved that it only got worse and worse and worse! So what exactly occurs? I'd really rather not say--it would spoil all the fun. But it really does pay off in this clever but sick comedy.",Death at a Funeral
1,SnoopyStyle,fine British farce,7,15 January 2017,"Daniel (Matthew Macfadyen) and his wife Jane (Keeley Hawes) live in his father's home. Jane is eager to pay the deposit for their new flat. The father dies and they hold the funeral at the home. The day starts off badly when the wrong body arrives. Friends Howard (Andy Nyman) and Justin (Ewen Bremner) pick up Uncle Alfie. Justin is only there to chase after Martha. Daniel's cousin Martha (Daisy Donovan) is moving in with Simon (Alan Tudyk). Sandra (Jane Asher) is the widowed wife and Robert (Rupert Graves) is the self-obsessed writer son who refuses to do the eulogy or pay for his half of the funeral. Everybody wants the successful writer Robert to do the eulogy. Martha innocently takes a pill from her pharmacy student brother Troy (Kris Marshall) for Simon. It's a drug specially designed by Troy and Simon doesn't react well. Along with a cavalcade of family and friends, mysterious stranger Peter (Peter Dinklage) shows up with a secret about the father although Daniel keeps ignoring him.This is a fine British farce. There are some fun wacky stuff in here but no big laughs. The actors work well together. They are all good at inhabiting their roles and make each one memorable. It's a lot of chuckle worthy individual performances especially Tudyk.",Death at a Funeral
2,kosmasp,How to ...,9,8 January 2008,"What is the recipe then for a good comedy? Watch this film and you know what! Not that this is a complete innovation or reinvention of the genre. But nevertheless this is a very good movie indeed, especially if you like your comedy served black! A welcome return for Frank Oz then! :o) The ingredients of this then are: Well drawn characters, who have their flaws and needs (desires), that fit your story. Of course you'll need the actors to play them (excellent in this case). But most of all, you need a very good script. A script that plants in the beginning and later unfolds those planted seeds to a superb effect (with an odd surprise here and there, but most of the things are set up, from the beginning)! It's been quite some time, since I laughed out loud, while watching a movie (comedy), but it happened here! What also happened here(literally here), was that someone reported this/my review and it got deleted (for no apparent reason), because I followed the guidelines ... anyway it's up again and I hope it stays. If someone thinks something is wrong with my review, please do write me first with your complaint! Thank you :o) PS: I do think I know what happened. Since I was the first one to write a review, it couldn't be about me stealing words from someone else, but someone thought I had seen the movie illegally. This is not the case! I watched it at a Sneak Preview in Germany in a theatre. I still have my ticket to prove that :o)",Death at a Funeral
3,gavin6942,Brilliantly Funny Movie,8,30 August 2012,"Chaos ensues when a man (Peter Dinklage) tries to expose a dark secret regarding a recently deceased patriarch of a dysfunctional British family.This film is fantastic and I wish it would have gotten more praise when it came out. Obviously someone noticed it, because it was quickly remade for American audiences. I have not (yet) seen the remake, but I also think I do not need to. There is no room for improvement on this film. Funeral directors who bring the wrong body, a blackmailing midget, a bad drug trip, an incontinent uncle... what is missing here? Nothing. And it is directed by Miss Piggy.Peter Dinklage takes center stage as soon as he appears. And why not? As Ebert notes, ""Dinklage can look handsome in that menacing way that suggests he's about to dine out on your fondest hopes and dreams."" You know his appearance means the film is ready to blossom.I have nothing further to say about the movie other than this: see it.",Death at a Funeral
4,lee_eisenberg,Jane Asher returns,10,4 July 2009,"Frank Oz is probably most famous as Fozzie the Bear on ""The Muppet Show"". He has starred in almost every one of John Landis's movies. He has directed ""Little Shop of Horrors"", ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"", ""What About Bob?"", ""In & Out"", ""Bowfinger"" and ""The Score"".Now, he gives us something totally different. ""Death at a Funeral"" is probably the sort of flick that you wouldn't notice at the video/DVD store. But you should, because this has to be one of the funniest things that I've seen in years. Centering on a series of mishaps at the funeral of a patriarch - namely what an American dwarf (Peter Dinklage) reveals about the old man - they throw everything at you when you least expect it. To be certain, there's plenty of stuff that makes you laugh just at the thought that people will do this on screen. The funniest parts are anything relating to Valium.Among other things, it was interesting to see Jane Asher back on screen after all these years. In case you've never heard of her, she and Paul McCartney were once an item, and she co-starred with Vincent Price in ""The Masque of the Red Death"". This is definitely one that I recommend. You're sure to love it.",Death at a Funeral
5,blanche-2,a man's funeral turns into a three-ring circus,8,17 September 2013,"""Death at a Funeral"" is a hilarious British black comedy from 2007 starring Matthew MacFadyen, Peter Dinklage, Jane Asher, Alan Tudyk, Kris Marshall, Rupert Graves, and Peter Vaughan.A family gathers for the patriarch's funeral: his wife (Asher), his son Daniel (MacFadyen) and his wife Jane (Keely Hawes, MacFadyen's real-life wife), and his son Robert (Rupert Graves). Robert is a well-known author living in a New York City penthouse; Daniel and Jane have been looking after his parents but now are planning to get a flat further away. Daniel and Robert are supposed to split the cost of the funeral, but Robert claims to have no money because it's expensive to keep up his lifestyle. He also won't give the eulogy, though everyone who walks in asks him if he's going to. Meanwhile, Daniel practices a eulogy but never seems to get past, ""My father was an exceptional man."" Meanwhile, the funeral home has brought the wrong body and has to return to get the right one.Daniel and Robert's cousin Martha (Daisy Donovan) is attending the funeral with her boyfriend Simon (Tudyk). When they go to pick up Troy (Marshall), Martha gives the nervous Simon what she thinks is a Valium. It's a hallucinogenic concocted by Troy, who is a pharmacy student. By the time they get to the wedding, Simon is acting strangely. Not as strangely as he would act later on, but strangely.Daniel notices a dwarf (Dinklage) at the funeral; the man says he wants to speak with Daniel privately. His name is Peter.That's all I'll say but the story becomes more and more bizarre and funny, including a hypochondriac with a discoloration on his wrist that he's sure is a dreaded disease, blackmail, nudity, a locked bathroom, and lots of other things.Very, very entertaining with fine performances, no one going for laughs, just playing the characters. That's really the way to do it. One of my favorite parts occurs when Robert tries to dismiss the problems brought in by Peter, saying, ""Oh, no one even noticed him."" ""No one noticed him?"" Daniel asks. ""He's 4'5!"" A lovely ending puts the cap on this entertaining film.",Death at a Funeral
6,Quinoa1984,"ribald yet refined, it's like a BBC movie of the night with just the right dash of classic National Lampoon",8,2 September 2007,"It's hard to exactly make material- I mean essentially in the story structure, and with most of the characters- that aren't too complicated or even predictable into a great film. But I don't think necessarily that was director Frank Oz's intention with Dean Craig's script. The key to making Death at a Funeral- a 'classic farce' about a recently deceased patriarch's funeral day at a house where chaos slowly but surely ensues- is to have just the right cast members, with a couple of possible surprises, and a fine touch on how to time every gesture however subtle (as the Brits can sometimes get, like awkward moments when the priest says patiently ""get a move on already, I have other appointments!"") or grandiose (a naked man hallucinating on a rooftop blowing spit bubbles, for only one of many examples), to a note that sparks up true hilarity. In that sense, Oz's film is a real success, a dark horse for best British comedy so far in 2007, where being tasteless is all apart of the fun. It doesn't mean necessarily every joke in the film is 100% new and original for audience consumption. But as a synthesis of possibilities for outrageousness in 2007, and even with hints of joy in the aftermath, it's a winner.Daniel (Matthew MacFadyen in a sublimely deadpan role where mostly he sulks or reacts as maybe the one ""normal"" person in the family) is burying his father, and is joined by people not seen in years, like a snobbish brother, a constantly embittered crank of an uncle, relatives who may be unknowingly high on acid (Alan Tudyk's finest performance of the absurd, playing in every shot as if it's got to be the funniest moment in the film, and many scenes are) or with allergies on their wrists, or with old lust renewed (skeezy Ewen Bremner, an odd and perfect choice for ladies man), or, of course, the mysterious little guy (Peter Dinklage) who carries a secret worthy of his blackmail request. If one is very familiar with farces by now- and they come as old-fashioned as an Oscar Wilde or even a Shakespeare now and then- then some of the chaos that ensues, in the context of the nature of mishaps and misunderstandings and overreaction, should be nothing new. But there are genuine laughs earned, fully belly laughs, as if one is totally familiar with these men and women on one level or another soon after they're established.There's set-up, pay-off, more pay-off, a little extra set-up, and then pay-offs in spades. Sometimes its based on repetition, which occasionally is a little simplistic (i.e. Daniel not getting money really ready for a new flat), or nearing 'old hat' (old man does have to *go* to the bathroom, after all). But sometimes the same repetition brings on the unexpected. I loved seeing Tudyk freaking out at the casket 'moving' and then the body tumbling out, or the running gag with Peter's pictures of him and Daniel's father in some compromising positions (all we need is reaction, of course, not the actual pictures themselves). But most of all seeing the suspense of the situations boiling over, of the strange dance, if one could call it that, of moving a (dead?) body from one room to another, or the result of that, or the result of a desperate attempt by a nude man on a roof, or of other things unsaid but felt all the same. Simply put- it's absurd to the bone, proud of it, and with a bit of heart by film's end.",Death at a Funeral
7,edwagreen,Death Has Complications At this Funeral *1/2,4,18 January 2011,"Inane farce dealing with what can go wrong at a funeral. Even with Martin Lawrence and Chris Rock as brothers who have lost their father, this film borders on the absolute ridiculous.Even the usually funny Loretta Devine is relatively subdued as their grieving mother, who still makes constant mention that she is still not a grandmother.We see two brothers, both writers, in conflict over the fact that Lawrence is a best selling writer, but the married Rock can't seem to get through his novel.Complications include Peter Dinklage showing up as the dead father's gay lover, and how they try to get rid of him. This only backfires into more ridiculous situations. The drugging of the boyfriend of a relative by accident is played out way above being funny.",Death at a Funeral
8,michaelRokeefe,A funeral causes chaos.,3,6 March 2008,"Frank Oz directs this comedy that has been hailed as riotously funny. The farce of it all...well there is some slapstick, sight gags and situational comedy; I just didn't enjoy as much as I wanted to. There seems to be very little recognized dignity as a dysfunctional family's patriarch is laid to rest. It seems every family member arrives with their own secondary jealousy filled agenda. If this family didn't have enough doubt among themselves...a mysterious guest threatens to let loose a dark family secret. So blackmail joins the chaos as these British mourners try to ""keep a stiff upper lip"". The cast includes: Matthew Macfadyen, Keely Hawes, Peter Dinklage, Ewen Bremner, Kris Marshall, Rupert Graves and Jane Asher.",Death at a Funeral

10,jotix100,How the other half dies,8,23 November 2008,"Funerals, in general, can be perceived as too ghoulish for a movie. Enter Frank Oz, the genius behind some funny pictures: Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, In & Out, and Little Shop of Horrors, just to mention a few of his successes. Working on the inspired screenplay by Dean Craig, the viewer is in for a delightful time at the movies.We are taken to a funeral being held at the home of moneyed gentry in England. The patriarch of the family having passed away, is brought home for a final tribute from his kin and close friends. The proceedings don't go too well, to put it mildly, when the undertakers deliver the wrong dead person, something that Daniel, a son, notices in horror. Once the proper body is brought back, can the funeral begin.Daniel, and his brother, the successful novelist, Robert, are at odds because they have different views about how to go on with the eulogy. Daniel wants to do it, but his more famous sibling was really the one everyone expects to hear. To make matters worse, the niece of the dead man, Martha, is bringing his dopey fiancé, Simon, with her. Simon, who is a bundle of nerves, is given a pill that she finds in her brother's home, thinking it is Valium, when in reality it is something similar to LSD! Things go wrong all over. There are confrontations, delays, and bickering among most of the family members. To complicate matters, a strange man of small stature is seen among the mourners. This man, it turns out, has known the dead man in more intimate circumstance to the horror of all that learn about it. Then there is also a patriarch figure of an older uncle who is wheel chair bound and can't contain his bowels at a crucial time.""Death at a Funeral"" is one of the funniest comedies that came from England in 2007. It has the right ingredients going for it. One of the best things is Matthew MacFadyen, who plays Daniel, the brother that wants to be at the center of the ceremony. This actor is terrific in anything we have seen him in. Rupert Graves takes a comedic turn as Robert, the man living in New York. Peter Dinklage puts in an appearance as the dead man's lover who wants to be taken care by the estate. Jane Asher shows up as the widow. Daisy Donovan is great as Martha and Alan Tudyk is her boyfriend on an acid trip.The film will delight audiences looking for comic relief watching how the rich deal with a funeral that goes wrong from the start.",Death at a Funeral
11,Hey_Sweden,I love a good funeral!,8,16 November 2013,"Wonderful dark comedy / farce, written and performed to perfection, with an endearing and convincing British cast making the most of the material by screenwriter Dean Craig. Deftly handled by American director Frank Oz, it puts a dysfunctional bunch of relatives through some very trying times during the funeral for a patriarch. It might not always be truly laugh out loud funny, but it's twisted enough - and relatable enough - to put a smile on your face and keep it there. The setting is ideal because who better than the Brits could deliver lines in such a hilariously deadpan way and try to keep a stiff upper lip while chaos reigns?Among the story threads here are the dead mans' son Daniel (Matthew MacFadyen) having to live in the shadow of his brother Robert (Rupert Graves), a successful novelist, Simon (Alan Tudyk) being given a ""Valium"" to help him calm down when in reality the pill he took was a hallucinogen, a diminutive blackmailer (Peter Dinklage) showing up at the funeral with a shocking revelation for one and all, and poor, put-upon Howard (Andy Nyman) being forced to repeatedly deal with a cantankerous, wheelchair-bound senior named Uncle Alfie (Peter Vaughan). Things just get more and more out of control until the frantic climax, and that's when Daniel finally tries to get things back on course with a eulogy that is improvised but completely heartfelt.While typing this review, this viewer is reminded of that old adage that ""everybody grieves in their own way"", and what you won't see watching this is excess sentiment. The mourning is believable, no matter if people aren't doing that much crying. The humour, of course, is priceless. The film does go for the grossout in a big way at one point, but this provide worry wart Howard something to fret over that's worse than any mild skin discolouration. The cast is a treat to watch. Also included in this talented ensemble are lovely ladies Keeley Hawes, Daisy Donovan, and Jane Asher, as well as Ewen Bremner, Kris Marshall, Thomas Wheatley, and Peter Egan. Knowing that Tudyk is actually a Texan, it makes his performance that much more impressive as he fits right in among this crowd.Oz eases his audience into the film with a modest chuckle to begin with, and he and his actors do a fine job of making the pace pick up bit by bit. The ending is particularly funny.All in all, a bright and refreshing comedy; remade for American audiences three years later under the same title.Eight out of 10.",Death at a Funeral
12,preppy-3,It's funny...but a bit too cruel for me,7,18 June 2007,An upper class British family gathers for the funeral of their father. Naturally everything goes wrong. Son Daniel wants his brother to help--but his brother is only interested in getting a girl into bed; a cousin's straight-laced boyfriend accidentally takes a hallucinogenic that makes him act quite crazy (leading to an uproarious--if sick--bit with a coffin); a little person shows up with some secrets that the family didn't know about; an elderly uncle swears nonstop and causes complications and various family members get involved with one calamity after another.I saw this as a special preview at a film festival. My audience was in absolute hysterics almost constantly. I did laugh long and loud more than once and this movie has a wonderful cast going full force...but I wasn't crazy about it. Some of the humor was far too cruel for me to enjoy (poor Alan Tudyk is forced to walk around nude) and there was some real sick bathroom humor here too. The black comedy however worked well and the dead pan expressions of the cast as one disaster after another happens were quite funny. It does lead to a truly hilarious eulogy at the end. Worth catching but don't go out of your way for it.,Death at a Funeral
13,dbborroughs,Bland,4,2 January 2008,"British ensemble comedy by way of Frank Oz. I don't know what to say. Amusing to a point its just not very engaging, at least for me. Did I really need to see what happens when the family comes together for their fathers funeral and then wigs out? Yes I do, but only if it was more amusing than this. Blame the scriptwriter who came up with a rather dull script with switched bodies, wrong drugs, a dark secret and familial unhappiness. I really didn't care about anyone since no one is given characters to play so no one seems different than anyone else. I kept confusing the women and several of the men to the point where I got more and more annoyed.(I understand its a funeral and everyone dresses in dark colors but you really should make the people stand out) You may like it I didn't. 4ish out of 10",Death at a Funeral
14,lastliberal,Everything is so f*cking green.,8,27 June 2010,"So, how does Yoda (Frank Oz) do as a director? Not bad actually. He uses the Force to give us a funny look at funerals.Peter Dinklage shows, and nobody really knows who he is, one of the guests (Alan Tudyk) has taken a hallucinogen thinking it was Valium, and every body is disappointed that Robert (Rupert Graves) isn't doing the eulogy instead of Daniel (Matthew Macfadyen). Then, there is Uncle Alfie (Peter Vaughan).Things are set for a lot of laughs.But, when the reason for Peter's (Dinklage) appearance becomes know, it gets stranger than you can imagine.Then there is Simon (Tudyk) who has seven hours of bliss left.It was hilarious.",Death at a Funeral
15,evanston_dad,I've Never Had So Much Fun at a Funeral,8,18 May 2009,"A quite funny and likable little black comedy about a lot of things going wrong at a family funeral.This reminded me of all those Ealing Studios films from the 1940s and 50s that starred Alec Guinness and made an art out of morbid comedy. In this film, a soft-spoken son (Matthew MacFadyen) tries to retain some dignity at the funeral of his father even while one guest turns up accidentally zonked out on acid (he thought it was valium) and his father's gay lover (no, no one knew the father was gay) shows up and tries to blackmail the brothers into giving him a piece of the inheritance in exchange for keeping their father's secret a secret. The movie is funny in that low-key way that British films pull off so flawlessly, and you'll probably find yourself having a pretty decent time.Grade: A-",Death at a Funeral
16,ferguson-6,Try Phillip,8,25 August 2007,"Greetings again from the darkness. Marvelous dark comedy from writer Dean Craig and director Frank Oz (best known as Yoda). Excellent performances throughout, including numerous minor roles. I loved how some crackling individual scenes fit right in to the fabric of the entire picture.Many of the British actors won't be recognizable to American audiences, but the lead is played by Matthew Macfayden, who played simmering Mr. Darcy in the most recent ""Pride and Prejudice"". But he is just part of a tremendous comedy ensemble that includes the brilliant Andy Nyman, a very odd Ewen Bremnar, Daisy Donovan, Jane Asher, Kris Marshall, Rupert Graves, Peter Dinklage and a truly standout physical performance by Alan Tudyk. I would have paid to watch Mr. Tudyk read the script as he realizes he spends most of the movie spaced out on a fabricated drug while frolicking naked on the roof top.While the physical comedy is top notch, what I enjoyed most was the nuances of the individual characters. We immediately catch on to personalities through touches like a small skin rash, a hyper-ventilating driver, a first class plane ticket and anxiety over delivering a eulogy. Some truly exceptional moments on screen make for a most entertaining film.",Death at a Funeral
17,gradyharp,Hilarious Romp Through Unlikely Subject Material,8,29 February 2008,"Like so many others this viewer waited for the DVD release of DEATH AT A FUNERAL, thinking that a comic take on a potentially morbid subject might not be very entertaining. Couldn't have been more wrong! This is the kind of humor the Brits do so well - intelligent, expertly delivered dialog and action that can make even the most unlikely situations hilarious. Writer Dean Craig and Director Frank Oz have created a farce and have put this tongue in cheek situation in the hands of some the best of the British actors. The result is a spinning top that only gradually allows the viewer to breath from laughing during the clever final credits.The father of a very dysfunctional family has died and son Daniel (Matthew MacFadyen) and his wife Jane (Keeley Hawes) have agreed to host the funeral. After the mortuary first delivers the wrong corpse the tone is set for all the wrong things to happen. The arriving family is a bizarre clan of characters - a novelist living beyond his means in New York (Rupert Graves), a man who unwittingly mistakes an hallucinogen for Valium and ends up on a trip that entertains all, a 'drug distributor', a crotchety old man with toilet problems, and the usual stuffy and goofy associates that so often populate the British comedies. And when it seems as though little else could support sanity, up pops a figure form the US (Peter Dinklage) with a secret about the deceased and proceeds to cause a situation that becomes the focal point of this zany funeral.Saying too much about each of the characters diminishes the surprises that abound. Were it not for the fact that each of the actors in the film is 'top drawer' this little movie could have become mawkish or tasteless, but this cast and director have produced one of the most refreshingly funny films of the past year.

18,zetes,"Not great, but it ends up being pretty funny by the end",7,19 August 2007,"Amusing, if obvious comedy. It pretends to be one of those wry, British comedies, but the laughs come mostly from cheap jokes involving drugs, sex and poop. But, hey, I can't complain much because there are some good laughs. The cast is good. I especially liked Andy Nyman as a hypochondriac. Alan Tudyk of the show Firefly is also funny (if certainly not British) as the guy who accidentally drops acid. Peter Dinklage, the little person from The Station Agent, is also in it as the man trying to blackmail Matthew Macfayden at his father's funeral. This would have been a better movie if it had gotten off to a quicker start. The film is worth seeing, but wait for video.",Death at a Funeral
19,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Death at a Funeral,10,30 September 2007,"Funerals are serious business, where the mood is usually grim and sombre, and friends and family come together to commemorate the passing of their loved one. The proceeding is usually prim and proper, with some protocols to adhere to, for fitting tributes given in a dignified manner.Death at a Funeral however, is a delightfully wicked black comedy of everything that can go wrong in a funeral. Daniel (Matthew Macfadyen) is preparing for the funeral of his dad, but my, there are so many things on his plate, such as bring trusted to provide the eulogy rather than his brother Robert (Rupert Graves), who is a best selling author, and having his wife constantly remind him about their deposit for their new home.With the gathering of family and friends, expect the bizarre to happen, and it involves around, and this is not exhaustive, meeting the new prospective father-in-law when you're high on hallucinogens (Alan Tudyk in a scene stealing role here), a perpetually missing bottle of ""Valium"", a pastor who's in a hurry, an old senile uncle with a foul mouth, and a 4 foot tall stranger who seems to have a very shocking secret to reveal should he not get his way. There are multiple plot elements here all perfectly linked together like a well oiled stage play, and resolved in very satisfying outcome.As a comedy, there are the big moments that are played out just for laughs, but what is commendable, is how it managed to sustain that laughter throughout the movie. It's not just laugh out loud moments, but little chuckles sprinkled along the way that had brought out smiles. And as you would already come to expect from a British production, the movie contains superb individual spoken lines that you would have to listen attentively to (and deserves repeat watching), but at the same time doesn't give you an inkling of a feeling that it's only for the linguistically-skilled, because hey, it does enjoy that occasionally toilet humour as well!If you're in need for a good laugh, then Death at a Funeral is a crystal clear choice this week!",Death at a Funeral

Alan Tudyk is hilarious, especially in the scene when he comes out nude and plans to kill himself. Daisy Donovan is controlled and delivers a truly fine performance.

21,Smells_Like_Cheese,Can't help but laugh at a funeral,9,18 March 2008,"Sadly, I've been to way too many funerals in my short life, every funeral I've been too is always sad and traditional, when I saw the trailer for Death at a Funeral, I knew this was a movie I had to see. I rented it a few days ago and I was so glad that I watched it, because sometimes I think that out of an extremely depressing situation, we need a good laugh just to relieve something in our bodies. The thing about Death at a Funeral, all these situations that happen are just horrible, but they made it into just this whole predicament into something worth laughing at. The actors just looked like they had the ultimate time making this film and enjoyed telling the story and that makes the movie so much more fun. From the beginning to the very end this movie is non stop in the laughs.Daniel is about to go through the toughest day, he has just lost his dad and is having the funeral at his house. From the first minute, the undertaker has brought the wrong corpse, and relatives are having a hard time getting there. When everyone finally comes and the right body is there, things go wrong again, Simon, a boyfriend of Sara(Dan's cousin), takes what he thinks is Valium, it's actually hallucinates and wonders onto the roof naked. Daniel bumps into a short man, Peter, who is claiming that he has slept with Dan's dad and will tell everyone if he doesn't give him money. The situations jut get wackier as the film continues.Death at a Funeral is just so funny, it's horrible situations, but you can't help but laugh, especially at Simon's situation with the hallucinates, him in the bathroom with the toilet paper was just priceless. The actor that played him, played him off perfectly and didn't go over the top with the situation that most actors would've made unbelievable. I highly recommend this movie, it will give you a guaranteed laugh, I mean, during Daniel's eulogy, if you don't laugh, I think you'll have to have your funny bone checked.9/10",Death at a Funeral
22,KineticSeoul,"Pretty good black comedy, but a bit overrated",5,11 May 2011,"I don't know if it's because I saw this movie after watching the 2010 version, but the original is somewhat better. The original is actually funny and the script is tight and fresh. This is a enjoyable black comedy, where it takes something tragic but makes the audience laugh. Which might come off a bit wrong, but the execution is done well. I actually got few genuine chuckles from this movie, while almost got nothing from the 2010 version. The plot is basically about almost everything going wrong in a funeral service in a black comedy funny manner and the jokes work sometimes. I personally didn't find the movie hilarious or felt like one of the best comedies I ever seen, but it's a delightful black comedy. This movie isn't good as what I expected and a bit overrated in my opinion but still beats the 2010 remake by some margin.5.5/10",Death at a Funeral
23,sddavis63,Great British Comedy,8,25 February 2008,"For some strange reason, I had to watch this twice before I really got into it. On first viewing, I wasn't taken with it at all but I decided to give it a second chance, and somehow there seemed to be a lot more to it on the second viewing, and, much to my surprise, I really found myself quite taken with it.The whole movie revolves around the events at the funeral of Robert and Daniel's father (played by Rupert Graves and Matthew McFadyen respectively.) A lot of things go strangely wrong at this funeral, beginning with the casket being knocked over and the body spilling out, and everything from that point on goes from bad to worse (in a funny sort of way.) The real highlights for me were the whole story surrounding Simon (Alan Tudyk) who accidentally ingests acid, thinking it was valium (because he needed to calm down) and actually ends up naked on the roof of the house as the centre of attention. Then there was Peter Dinklage as Peter - the ""little person"" who, it turns out, had a gay affair with the deceased and expects to be paid for keeping quiet about it. The scene in which he comes popping out of the coffin after Robert and Daniel thought they had taken care of that ""little "" problem had me in stitches.This is a great example of British comedy. Warning: it's quite foul-mouthed, and if you are truly offended by a lot of use of the ""F-word"" then this would not be to your taste. Otherwise, this is a very funny movie. 8/10",Death at a Funeral
24,ElMaruecan82,Many shenanigans ... and one funeral...,7,17 June 2021,"From its opening scene, one can easily guess where ""Death at a Funeral"" is driving at. Frank Oz concocted a comedy of (good) manners using the most extreme context of seriousness to plug it with its polar opposite through a cable of more-or-less predictable incidents, revelations, twists and plain visual gags that include a full-naked man escalating a roof. It's a tricky kind of comedy that totally depends on the reactions rather than the anticipation, and for the most part it works.Take that first gag for instance when a long-faced Daniel, played by Michael McFayden, is brought his father's coffin. From the obligatory stern and solemn look with a touch of sadness in his eyes, you can tell the poor man is desperately trying to conceal some deep shock while conforming to his status as the deceased's heir, he must show without showing too much. Now in any lesser movie, the sight of the wrong dead in the coffin would have inspired an over-the-top wide-eyed reaction or the act of kicking the undertakers out of the house with a few colorful names. McFayden is befuddled but doesn't overreact as if something had convinced him that such mistakes were possible, forgiving those poor chaps who also have the right reactions with that 'oh crap! The boss won't be happy' guilty looks. They take back the wrong coffin and leave us with the sentiment that humor will be handled with the cautious delicacy of pallbearers.""Death at a Funeral"" with its exquisite title promising a great deal of British absurdism, is an interesting combination of the roles of seriousness as a crash barrier and humor as a Damocles sword that can befall at any moment. So the question is never: how goofy the situation can get but how much will the characters contain themselves before exploding? It's a comedy with the timing of a ticking bomb and again, it works so many times that we might forgive the slower moments. Because that's the catch of such comedies, they demand a sort of patience from viewers and must take time to establish the characters. And think about that: celebrations such as parties or weddings are better expositional devices as they allow characters to behave according to their personalities. Here we need to see them interacting in the intimacy of their cars before putting on the mourning masks, and there's a shade of truth resonating in these scenes that remind us how we let enough of ourselves steam off as a necessary preliminary before protocol forbids any attempt to be natural.And so we have Jane, Daniels's devoted wife played by Keeley Hawes; who tries to convince her isolated husbdan that everything will turn fine while everyone complains about him reading the eulogy since his brother is the writer of the family. Speaking of Robert, he's played by Rupert Grave, a successful writer who had just come from his penthouse in New York and brings with him the news that he's broke and can't allow Daniel to save some money to buy a house, so much for the providential comer: no money and not even a prepared speech as a consolation. Daniel can only count on his wife's support and a few little cards not to miss some important key-moments of his father's life. Jane Asher is the tearful widower and is so underused in the earlier parts we can see some comical hysteria coming at such point. And in the subplot department, there's Ewen Bremmer as the obnoxious relative who keeps making moves on Martha (Daisy Donovan), the girlfriend of Simon (Alan Tudyk), despised by her father and Sandra's brother Victor (Peter Egan).Overall, the screenplay from Dean Craigs adroitly paints a family tree with one hand while making these interactions natural. At the end, each character exists for a purpose, Sandra's brother Troy (Kris Marchall) who specialized in pharmaceutical experiments exists because Simon must be so stressed at the idea of meeting the family he'll take valium pills ... only you might not expect a man to write 'LSD' on his bottles. Simon marks the first departure from subtle comedy to plain craziness and allows the film to move at two speeds. It's effective but I think it's a sort of cheat because the film doesn't need that, there's a great comedic potential in Fred Nyman as Howard the family's friend who must take care of Uncle Alfie (the great Peter Vaughan) and this leads to hilarious situations that involve pushing a wheelchair over a mounting hill and helping the old man to use the toilet. The fun isn't that the outcome is gross but because we can relate to it slightly more than the ""Trainspotting"" sheet incident.Just like we can all relate to Daniel's nervousness and despair to keep everything all right, trying to make the best of the event. I think that's the real power of ""Death at a Funeral"" as it captures how unnatural we all are when we're put in situations where we mus't shown any sign of.... The case of Simon is simply an extreme use of the situation of holding a laugh during a funeral, something that never fails to get me..What Oz does is setting the pieces of various little archetypes and make them evolve one by one until explosive finale where everything ties up quite well.You might notice I forgot one name from the cast, which is Peter Dinklage who makes for a great performance as the uninvited guest and the one unmissable presence, the one that brings all the chaos on everybody and that includes himself. What's good about ""Death at a Funeral"" is that it takes an ordinary situation where fun is merely impossible and makes the best out of it, that it never really cross the line of bad taste and keep consistent with the whole funeral decorum is certainly its best achievement.",Death at a Funeral
25,MLDinTN,a funny British comedy in which you can actually understand what they say,8,2 August 2009,"This was a pretty funny movie. It centers around a funeral and all the things that go wrong with it. Robert and Daniel are having a funeral for their father. A very short man shows up that turns out to be someone their father was having an affair with. And he basically wants to blackmail them for money or he will show the other family members incriminating pictures. The other main plot centers around a bottle labeled valium; however, it's really acid and other hallucinates. Martha gives her boyfriend, Simon, a ""valium"" and acts completely out of it for most of the film. Simon was the funniest character. You just knew he was going to start saying the coffin was moving. And the other funny guy was mean Uncle Alfie. The whole transferring him to the toilet was just gross yet amusing. And there were too many amusing scenes to mention them all.FINAL VERDICT: Betty than most British films. Definitely worth checking out.",Death at a Funeral

As they are having the wake at the family home, the funeral parlor delivers the body at the right moment. But, when Daniel opens the casket, it's not his dad, its someone else! The appalled pall bearers make a hasty retreat and go to fetch the correct corpse ASAP. Meanwhile, Daniel's writer brother (Rupert Graves) arrives from New York and flatly announces he can't pay his half of the funeral expenses. Buggers, Daniel and his lovely wife are counting on that money. On the way to the wake, also, is a relative named Martha and her new fiancé, Simon (Alan Tudyk). Simon is a bit nervous about meeting everyone so, as they are picking up Martha's brother, Martha borrows some valium from a bottle on the table. But, oh no, Martha! That's not valium but a LSD-type drug that her brother was hiding in the container. Needless to say, Simon begins to exhibit some strange behavior when they arrive at the funeral. Also on hand are the loudly grieving widow (Jane Asher), old dotty uncle Alfie, and a dwarf that no one has ever seen before. Will this be the solemn occasion it is supposed to be? This film is positively gleeful and a great watch. The cast is wonderful, with Macfadyan staying calm while chaos swirls around him. Graves is downright scummy and Tudyk gives a very humorous turn as a man under the influence. The ladies are quite lovely, too. In addition, the costumes, settings, direction and production are all top of the line. As for the script, it is absolutely inspired, although there are some who might object to the scenes involving sex and/or drug use. Nevertheless, if you are searching for a film that will result in big laughs for you and your friends, here it is.

The clever script is snappily directed and expertly acted by a large cast of British actors and two Americans, Dinklage and Tudyk, who hold their own. While the ensemble acting is terrific, standing out are Nyman as a neurotic guest and Macfadyen as the son of the deceased. This black comedy, later remade in Hollywood as a different sort of ""black"" comedy, is not a series of one- liners.

The acting, the direction, the script, the music, everything is superb, the effects and stupendous constant surprises and turning of events is simply marvellous, and yet there is something lacking. The laughs ultimately lose themselves in dumbfounded silence, and we never learn what ultimately really happened to the dwarf. But it is fun as long as it lasts, and funniest of all is the grumpy old uncle Alfie, who stubbornly persists in being in the worst of bad moods to the bitter end, even when he finally gets unexpectedly stimulated, like so many others accidentally, by what never should have taken place at a funeral.

30,Red-125,Death is rarely a laughing matter,8,10 September 2007,"Death at a Funeral (2007), directed by Frank Oz, is a truly funny film about a funeral. As an upper-class British family gathers to mourn the death of a patriarch, things begin to go wrong. Most of the humor revolves around the effects of a hallucinogen--predictable, but truly hilarious--as well as photographs of the deceased demonstrating an unexpected facet of his life.The film is cast in the traditional British ensemble style, so that all of the actors are excellent, but none stands out above the others. The exceptions for me were Daisy Donovan--who looks like Emma Thompson's younger sister--and Peter Dinklage as a man who delivers a very nasty message in a very articulate and somewhat understated fashion. This probably won't be the funniest film you've ever seen, but it's certainly extremely funny. It's worth seeking out in a theater, and should also work well on DVD.",Death at a Funeral
31,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Dark-humored British farce is to die for,8,25 June 2009,"A classic British farce, Frank Oz and Dean Craig's ""Death at a Funeral"" will produce some of the deepest laughs you've had for awhile and prove that even death can provide hilarious comic situations.Dark humor is one way to put it, but ""Death"" isn't dark as much as it takes what should be a dark and dramatic subject and turns it into something hilarious. The tone is set when the hearse delivers the wrong body and we know we're in for hijinx when the departed's niece (Daisy Donovan) accidentally gives her fiancé-to-be (Alan Tudyk) a highly potent form of acid from her brother's (Kris Marshall) flat not even an hour before the service. Things get serious (or seriously funny) when a strange man (Peter Dinklage) who no one has ever met arrives with a secret about the deceased.""Death at a Funeral"" has a full cast of wonderful unknowns, perfect for the small family who gets way in over its head. Only Tudyk, who had a role in American comedy ""Dodgeball"" and has done a lot of voice work, is recognizable and his performance, in which 90 percent of the film requires him to act like he's tripping, is responsible for much of the laughs early on.When a great concept for a farce clicks like it does here for Dean Craig, everything seems to work perfectly and this is one of those ideas. Its only challenge is being set during a funeral, an event that brings out the emotional, reflective side of people. So when Craig asks us to care about the serious aspects of the plot, it's hard for us to turn the laugh switch off and even if we do get that far, it's hard to really care. Still, anyone who loves outrageous comedy will find ""Death"" a killer farce.",Death at a Funeral
32,jzappa,Timing Is Everything,8,15 September 2007,"One of the best highlights of Death At a Funeral is Daisy Donovan, an actress I've never seen before with a pure and instinctive gift of comic timing. There are indescribable moments in this film where she delivers some of the greatest laughs. She's the most magnetic part of the cast, blending a purposely badly restrained fire with a quiet sensitivity. It's difficult to tell which one is innermore and which is lathered on top, which is what I think is the basis of the pull of her presence.Alan Tudyk has the charm of a rather uncomfortable stage actor who must settle into his role, as he must play a very naked and face-value physical comedy shtick throughout the entire film. He grows funnier and begins to balance out more with the film's riveting main chaotic farcical turning points. Matthew MacFayden, who also bears the charm of mild unassurance, plays the straight man of the film and wears his same serious, worrying face but impeccably timed evidence of constant emotional crescendos. He also carries out a very effective dramatic scene later in the movie.One of the funniest and most natural actors in the whole film, another great highlight, is Andy Nyman, whose overbearing neuroses and jittery, jabbering presence are eventually responsible for some of the greatest, hardest laughs I've had in a long time, many of them being, as Donovan's moments were, indescribable, because they are all about the acuity of the timing.The film's definite overall weakest link is the role of Ewen Bremner, ironically the best-known actor in the film, and a very good one. What's he doing here? There's no reason for his role. His character means absolutely nothing to the rest of the film. This flaw is worsened by the fact that it's a farce, thus because of his wanton screen time, the pace, which is everything to a farce, slows down.Overall, the film works beautifully. Dean Craig's script is a fussy, tense, nervous worrier's nightmare, and nearly every character in it is just that. Chaos ensues at this funeral with several different nerve-shredding things happening at once, more and more things that need desperately to be kept hidden and more and more people becoming inadvertently involved. It's a laugh-a-minute comedy in the classic, structural sense.",Death at a Funeral
33,billcr12,Funny Satire,8,31 May 2012,"Worth the price of admission just for the Monty Python-esque opening where men wheel a casket into a living room and a man, upon opening it, proclaims, ""that's not my father."" They quickly return to the wagon, and later bring back the proper body. The British flavor is hilarious, with a biting satire that never quits. Daniel and his wife Jane live in the house of his deceased father, and the other son Robert, a famous novelist who lives in New York, refuses to contribute to the cost of their father's burial. He does, however, spend a small fortune on a first class airline ticket. A eulogy is being prepared by Daniel because his brother, the writer, refuses to compose a tribute to their dad. All the while there are subplots, such as a cousin, Martha, with her fiancé, Simon who is given what he thinks is Valium for his nerves, when it is actually an LSD type of drug instead, causing him to act out inappropriately at the service.The funniest character is Peter(Peter Dinklage), a dwarf who tells Daniel that he and his father were lovers. He proceeds to demand money to keep the secret and has photographs to back up his claim. The surviving sons tie him up and give him the same drug given earlier to Simon. Peter frees himself and while in an altered state, jumps up and down and hits his head, knocking him out. They hide him in the coffin, believing he is dead. During the eulogy, Peter recovers and topples the casket to the floor and the compromising photos fall out, drawing shock and amazement from the mourners.

""Death at a Funeral"" is Frank Oz's new comedic concoction (no strings attached this time) about a family that comes together during a funeral, only to try to maintain their dignity as hilarious hijinks ensue. Some of these hijinks include psychedelic drug abuse, sordid sex lives revealed, and nude fiancees. You know, the usual.Most of the attraction of this film comes from the cast. The guy that plays Pete from Shaun of the Dead is the main character struggling to keep things in control as his family, his father's funeral, and his life is falling apart before his eyes. The guy from Firefly plays the fiancée that trips out and starts screaming naked across the rooftops. The guy from Station Agent plays the father's ex-lover, made all the more funny, 'cause, like, he's a dwarf. And so on...It's a pretty decent comedy, all told--takes up your two hours and makes you laugh once in a while. It holds no real surprises and doesn't break far from the house, making it somewhat confined and regulated--something that doesn't really help when trying to make a memorable comedy.

Normally any movie that includes the word ""death"" in the title is a movie that is implicitly telling the audience to beware, it's going to be morbid. Well, this movie is not only not morbid, it is hilarious, not just in a black-comedy way, but in a straightforward matter that uses a funeral as the basis for generating some very funny scenes. The movie contains no morbidity. Rather, it is like an extended sitcom that portrays various people acting very silly and goofy. Everyone in this movie was funny, and one should not be turned off by the title because although death is a serious subject that should not be treated lightly, the movie really isn't about death at all, but actually about life and how silly and crazy people can act when the situation presents itself.",Death at a Funeral
37,MaxBorg89,Another British triumph!,9,15 August 2007,"Anyone who has seen Six Feet Under knows how many crazy things can occur while preparing a funeral. Frank Oz's latest film takes that concept one step further, showing how insane the situation might get during the actual ceremony.Set in the English countryside, Death at a Funeral is an undeniably British product, a fact that is proved beyond doubt in the first scene, where the coffin arrives and Daniel (Matthew Macfadyen) remarks: ""That's not my father."". While he waits for the right body to show up, he also has to make sure all the guests show up so the service will be flawless. Naturally, the result is anything but, for a number of reasons: firstly, there's that problem with the eulogy, which will be delivered by Daniel even though everyone expects his brother Robert (Rupert Graves), a successful novelist, to take care of it; there's Uncle Alfie (Peter Vaughan), a wheelchair-bound, potty-mouthed, grumpy old man who needs constant attention; there's Justin (Ewen Bremner), a slacker whose presence at the funeral is strictly related to his wish to get back together with his ex, Martha; and there's Simon (Alan Tudyk), Martha's current love interest, who is finding it very hard to behave after accidentally taking some drugs (he mistook them for Valium). Add a neurotic widow (Jane Asher), a midget (Peter Dinklage) no one's ever seen before and several other guests, all with their own problems, and you get one hell of a day.Death at a Funeral succeeds because it starts superbly and proceeds in the same direction for the following 90 minutes: the writer, Dean Craig, has crafted an excellent script by slightly exaggerating common situations, thus providing the audience with a scenario that, however insane it may be, still looks plausible. Drugs, nudity, adultery (though not in the way you'd expect it), lots of swearing (Vaughan pronounces more F-words in the first 15 minutes than Hugh Grant did for the entire duration of Four Weddings and a Funeral): all of these are included in the movie, yet one never gets the impression that Craig and Oz are taking it too far, thanks to a down-to-earth approach that keeps things simple and believable without bordering on the contrived or ridiculous.The simplicity is also evident in the director's casting choices: partly because of the low budget, but certainly also to ensure the characters are easier to identify with, the actors are all relatively unknown, with the exception of Macfadyen (Pride & Prejudice), Bremner (Trainspotting) and Tudyk (Serenity and I, Robot), neither of which is an A-lister anyway. The lack of celebrity does not, however, affect the performances: as always with British comedy, the acting is spot-on, whether it's a physical gag (Tudyk's drug-induced behavior) or deadpan line delivery (Asher's dry ""Tea can do many things, Jane, but it can't bring back the dead."" being the highlight). In addition, though the focus is obviously on certain cast-members, Oz enables the entire ensemble to have at least one moment in the spotlight, thus making the fun come from a collective effort instead of one scene-stealing performer (although Tudyk and Vaughan get very close to doing so).Keeping its politically incorrect energy from funny start to outstanding finish (the cosing line is probably the best you'll hear all year), Death at a Funeral is further proof, after the triumphs of The Office, Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, that when it comes to comedy the British are in a league completely of their own.",Death at a Funeral

Some people will find themselves chuckling nonstop, but in the midst of all this laughter, some will stop and think, ""Have I seen this before?"" Many of the jokes in this are not original, and can be seen in many other recent films, but that doesn't really ruin the film at all. Any jokes recycled here are made much better than in any film I remember them in, so any scene you remember from another film, will probably have you laughing much harder here.Daniel (Matthew McFayden) is trying to get his father's funeral perfect, but there are several problems along the way. Little things like his author brother Robert (Rupert Graves) won't read an eulogy for his father, and the wrong coffin was initially delivered (sounds big, but it was really a little thing). Everything that happens at this funeral doesn't really sound too bad, but when too much chaos ensues at once, bad things happen, and in this case, humor blossoms from it.All the actors did a great job, and had perfect comedic timing. Not one actor was out of place. The movie was centralized at Daniel's house for the funeral, which gave it a more intimate feel. The characters were very eclectic, and they all worked as they were supposed to. One's created to be likable, were likable, and ones created to be goofy and good for some laughs, were. Amongst all the comedy, this also had some heart, which is rare in silly comedies.This was an exceptional movie, with some recycled jokes (hilariously presented), but even recycled jokes couldn't bring this one down.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 90 mins.

A lot of the ones which have come out since including Rock n' rolla and Happy-Go-Lucky have bored me to Death, but this one kept me very alive (ironically). It takes a short and convenient amount of time to set things up, and after it does, Death at a Funeral launches into outrageous slapstick comedy, all the way to the last shot.I don't want to spoil very much, so I'll break it down to basic. Two brothers are hosting an in-house funeral for their late father, and a dozen crazy things happen. The scenario becomes a big chain reaction, with one problem leading to another, until it gets totally out of control, and hopefully the audience is crying with laughter.

That may seem like a nothing statement, but more movies, especially ones that insist on multi-threaded story lines should pay attention to how this movie works structurally and mechanically. There are about 10 different story lines happening, and it is almost perfectly balanced. There are pivotal moments when the story lines come together (very similar things in ""Crash"", ""Love, Actually"", ""Snatch"", and ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels""), but without having to cut all over the place or having to re-tell parts of the story from other character perspectives. The movie moves on almost seamlessly from event to event, at a rather tilted rate at one point, and is never distracted from the movie.There are a ton of interesting characters, each with their own motivations, and the increasingly ridiculous scenarios that occur are all well established earlier on so it doesn't seem sudden or jarring.And if nothing else, Alan Tudyk losing his mind as he deals with being drugged is amazing, and well worth the watch all on it's own.Unless you're just crippled with anxiety about funerals, I expect that you'll enjoy this one very much.",Death at a Funeral

45,Chase_Witherspoon,Some funerals are more entertaining than weddings,7,13 October 2012,"Slow to warm-up, fortunately this understated British comedy fires on all cylinders when a wake is interrupted by the bizarre activities of its guests, among them a blackmailing dwarf (Drinklage), a drug-affected naked man (Tudyk) and the incontinence of the ageing and slightly demented Peter Vaughan character whose unfortunate nephew (Nyman) must tend to his care in comical fashion.McFadden plays the well-adjusted son entrusted with organising his wealthy father's funeral, his mother (the once-seductive and still glamorous Asher) the remaining parental link to a dysfunctional family whose dark secrets come to bear during a day of chaos and farce. Apart from Vaughan, Tudyk, Peter Egan and Asher, none of the cast was especially familiar to me at the time I saw this in 2008, but whether you know the names or not, it doesn't matter as all the weird and wacky characters offer something different.Tudyk is trademark eccentric as a guest who accidentally pops a party drug and ends up disrobing and climbing the stately castle's walls, while Drinklage has an hilarious scene where he bounces off a sofa onto a coffee table, and the moment where Nyman has to clean his uncle whose defecated is among the most side-splitting moments I've experienced.

Maybe some will fall flat but others will sure make you laugh. Apart from being a hilarious comedy, it's also a very sweet film. Yeah, it may be predictable but you can't help but go along with it.The performances were funny. The most notable one was from Alan Tudyk, although the whole ensemble had their fair shares of laughs. The movie is short and funny. What do you have to lose? Go out and buy or rent this movie and just have a good time!",Death at a Funeral

It's just not funny. First of all there is too much time devoted to petty problems the characters are having. We do not care about any of them, and they are not funny either  the characters or the problems. Someone is given some pills thought to be Valium, and..you guessed it. Nothing funny here either. Well, it may have been if actual acid was given to that character, thenmaybe. And, the surprise guest announces something shocking, but we in the audience knew what news he was going to give. No surprise here. Again, the story is okay, the acting is fine, the dialogue is acceptable, but all of this cannot combine to become a comedy as billed. It's just not funny. Why? Has to do with timing, I think.Violence: No Sex No Nudity: No Language: Yes",Death at a Funeral
48,Philby-3,An Ealing Comedy for the Noughties,7,13 October 2007,"This film was made at Ealing Studios in London, which produced in the 1950s a brilliant succession of anarchic comedies poking fun at various dark recesses of the English psyche. These included ""Passport to Pimlico"" Whisky Galore"", ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"", ""The Lavender Hill Mob"" and ""The Ladykillers"". Frank Oz, born in England but most famous for his contribution to the Muppets including the voice of Miss Piggy, has put together here a comedy of embarrassment something like one of those great Ealing comedies. He has also included a touch of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and some characters who seem to have strayed in from the set of ""Bridget Jones Bonks Mr Darcy Yet Again"". No Hugh Grant though.As everybody knows, amongst the English upper middle classes appearances are everything and much of the humor here comes from failure to keep them up. The central character, Daniel (Matthew Macfadyen) is a perfectly nice ordinary guy trying to organize his father's funeral in a dignified manner, the venue being his family's leafy but modest country home. He has being living there rather reluctantly with his equally nice wife Jane (Keely Hawes) while they save the deposit on a flat in town. Mum (Jane Asher), a neatness freak, is shell-shocked by her husband's sudden death. Daniel's brother Robert (Rupert Graves) a successful novelist living in New York turns up, but isn't much help either. The other characters include the deceased's brother Victor (Peter Egan) one of those doctors who has made brusqueness and art form, his daughter Martha (Daisy Donovan) another nice person who has fallen love with Simon, a perfectly harmless solicitor who Dad can't stand, for no apparent reason. There are also Troy (Kris Marshall from ""The Family"") an illegal drug manufacturer, and an ill-matched couple of guys Justin and Howard (Ewen Bremner and Andy Nyman). I'm not sure how the latter fit in to the family but they are needed for some of the heavier humor involving wheelchair-bound Uncle Alfie, played by a gloriously foul-mouthed Peter Vaughan). Finally there is Peter (Peter Dinklage ""The Station Agent""), a small guy with an angle of his own on the deceased.This is a very funny film and hardly a moment is wasted. It veers from coarse slapstick, coarser than 50s Ealing would have permitted, to quite poignant. You can't help feeling for Matthew whose blameless life is being turned upside down by a series of random events  a bungle by the funeral director, his brother's fecklessness, Simon the quiet solicitor ingesting Troy's home-made LSD by mistake and going bananas and the advent of the dwarf and his sinister intentions. Despite the chaos that ensues, the funeral party generally keeps its composure and the drinks keep coming. Perhaps the message is that good catering can paper over the most awful social gaffes. There are some off-colour bits (which the mature audience I saw this with all seemed to love) but overall this is a difficult movie to dislike.",Death at a Funeral
49,fwomp,Sneaks Up And Surprises You,10,5 October 2007,"The great thing about DEATH AT A FUNERAL is that there really is something for everyone. From brief bathroom humor to dark jokes, it's all there, laid out by UK-born director Frank Oz.The title itself is a bit misleading, in that you would think it to be more horror-ish or dramatic. The words ""Death"" and ""Funeral"" don't normally make you skip to the theater thinking ""Oh boy! Let's go watch this funny movie!"" For that, I would fault only the production person who stamped the name on it. But that would be my only one; one which has nothing to do with the rest of this riotously funny film.Like a snake creeping upon its prey, Death at a Funeral also slowly makes its way along, never lurching or jumping ahead of itself, building the comedic moments one upon the other. Starting out (as all the trailers have shown) with Daniel (Matthew Macfadyen) standing in his livingroom, watching his father's coffin being delivered in preparation for a British homestyle service. But once the coffin is open, Daniel states, ""That's not my father."" The funeral home quickly whisks away the casket and returns with the right one. This gradual sinking in of dark comedy holds the film together exceptionally well.We're then introduced to the rest of the cast...Jane (Keeley Hawes, TRISTAM SHANDY), Daniel's wife who's pressuring him to buy a flat in the city and leave his now widowed mother with his successful brother in New York.Simon (Alan Tudyk, SERENITY), who is arriving at the funeral with his soon-to-be wife and is stressed about meeting (again) his future father-in-law, so is accidentally given a pill thought to be valium but, in reality, turns out to be a powerful hallucinogenic. This sends Simon on a running joke throughout the film, including periods of catatonia, color fascinations, and rooftop nudity.Uncle Alfie (Peter Vaughan, KISS KISS BANG BANG), a crotchety old fart who's brought to the funeral in a wheelchair only to find himself with explosively needy bowels and the witness to a possible murder.Peter (Peter Dinklage), a midget-of-a-man with big life aspirations who comes to the funeral not only to mourn the death of a close ""friend,"" but to also get what ""he deserves"" from the family.There are other perpetrators in the film, too, but these are the main ones who's paths cross just about everyone else's.The film's short 90 minute run time is excellent in that none of the funnies are overdone. They have their moment and are either tossed aside or folded over into the film's grand finale. The number one folding in of jokes has to be the faux-valium pill bottle that gets lost and re-lost only to spring up at the most hilarious moments.This is a laugh-a-minute film that has perfect comedic timing and crucial usage of British pompous humor, along with dark moments that will make watchers cringe and giggle at the same time.",Death at a Funeral

51,itamarscomix,Gallows Humor,7,26 November 2012,"Death at a Funeral (2007 original, not to be confused with the awful American remake from 2010) is everything that's good about British comedy, and if you're a fan of British humor you're likely to enjoy it. With mainstream American comedy dumbing down more and more, it's nice to have a reminder of just how good Brits are in merging high-brow and low-brow, in creating a simple comedy which features corpses falling out of caskets, fecal humor, nudity just for the heck of it and tons of sexual humor and still feels this classy. Death at a Funeral has terrific acting, intelligent dialog and restrained pacing, all of which lack in most recent American comedies.The one thing it lacks, and it's enough to bring the whole thing down a bit, is likable and interesting characters - especially the main characters, who we don't really get to know and don't really care about. The supporting cast hides some real gems though; Alan Tudyk (pulling off a terrific English accent), Peter Vaughan, Ewen Bremner and of course Peter Dinklage are all hilarious and steal the show from Matthew Macfadyen and Rupert Graves. It's not that Macfadyen and Graves aren't good in the film - they deliver their lines perfectly and with terrific timing, but they don't get anything interesting to work with. That's why Death at a Funeral, while incredibly fun, is also a bit forgettable and doesn't make any real connection. It's a shame, because it could have been better than it is, but it's still very good.",Death at a Funeral
52,MihaiSorinToma,A very good comedy,8,5 October 2017,"When Daniel's father passes away, the whole family reunites at the mansion but the whole event is going to be disturbed by a small character who doesn't have the best intentions. Add up the fact that almost everyone has a secret or a problem of his own and you get a huge mess to enjoy. Will they be able to finish the ceremony or will there be another tragedy waiting to happen?It's the exact same plot as the movie with the same name from 2010 (yes, I've seen that one first) the only difference being the location. It's slow paced as the other one in the beginning until it introduces all its characters but when the action comes in (a bit later than I hoped) you simply cannot stop laughing. They managed to create a laughable atmosphere at a grim and sad event such as a funeral, fact which makes you appreciate their talent even more. The entire plot runs in the same location, all the characters trying to figure out multiple problems at once and failing miserably, thus provoking amusement. It's a comedy so don't expect miracles in terms of story but the actors do a very good job in keeping you entertained while the events, although some expected and stereotypical, create a good overall blend. It's a very good comedy, no doubt about it, but also nothing to blow your mind.",Death at a Funeral
53,oneloveall,Few moments of genuine hilarity,5,23 February 2008,"Manic British comedy attempts to speed up an initially slow start by introducing more and more absurdities into a funeral gathering until actually becoming anything worth laughing at.Though it tries to sweep viewers into any impending ridiculousness with increasing fervor, too often Death at a Funeral feels forced where it should feel funny.Certainly with a script not as dry as most British comedies and direction by Frank Oz, the movie feels calibrated for a cross-pollination market with enough restraint and shock to appease both sides. To that degree the movie is a relative success, if ever so modestly.",Death at a Funeral

The angry old man who misunderstands everything (remember him as a wedding guest in Four Weddings?) is given an expanded run out this time, wheelchair-bound to boot. A strait-laced guy accidentally takes hallucinogenic drugs. A former boyfriend stalks a bereaved offspring. Other attendees include a drug-dealer and a hypochondriac. And a vicar.All the right ingredients, none of the flavour. What went wrong? It is hard to tell. Sometimes I think they are trying too hard. The blooper reel suggests the cast had fun making the film, but their laughter was the only one I heard. The bottom line is, this one just isn't funny.

56,moviesleuth2,Great British comedy,7,16 June 2008,"There are those who say that British humor is a matter of taste. Some people, such as myself, simply don't get movies like ""A Fish Called Wanda"" and ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail."" As a director, Frank Oz's movies (like ""Bowfinger"" and ""What About Bob?"") don't make him a likely candidate to direct a movie like this. With ""Death at a Funeral,"" Oz tries to create a film made with distinctly British humor, while ""Americanize"" it enough to be accessible enough for those who haven't acquired that taste. It's an ambitious project, and surprisingly, Oz gets it right for the most part. ""Death at a Funeral"" gets off to a rocky beginning (though it has its share of a few laughs), but once it gets going the laughs are hearty and nonstop.""Death at a Funeral"" is a film that groups a number of stories that occur at a funeral. To give them away would to take away some of the surprises, but I will say this: there are a lot of them, and each has its own subplot, plus there are a few little stories sprinkled around for spice. What's more is that this is all told in real time (except for the last two scenes). But Oz deftly keeps it all in balance and there are no plot holes. Both writer Dean Craig and especially Oz deserve credit for this.There are really no actors that many American audiences will know, save for Peter Dinklage, and perhaps Ewen Bremner. But all the actors and actresses play their parts believably. There are no ""standout"" performances in the usual sense; this is an ensemble piece, and it's more important that the actors are in-sync with each other. That is key, and the even tone in the actors' performances is pervasive throughout the cast, and this is partly what makes ""Death at a Funeral"" as funny as it is.Dean Craig's script is well-constructed, and perfectly zany. Craig throws in everything he can think of: poop jokes, gay jokes, drug and sex humor, and some that's just uncategorizable. Craig clearly has a sense of humor, and that is what makes this film work.As many things that Oz does right, his foray into British comedy isn't perfect. The first part of the film is rather slow, and it isn't as accessible to those who don't have the acquired taste (for those that don't get it at first, stick with it, it gets better. A lot better.). Plus, the ending contains two instances that are meant to be empowering for some of the characters, but they don't work and are rather annoying. Other than that, ""Death at a Funeral"" is a great comedy.For those who are fed up with the lame brained, clichéd ""comedies"" that Hollywood keeps shelling out, take a look at ""Death at a Funeral."" It may have a morose subject, but that's what makes it funny.",Death at a Funeral
57,joachimokeefe,More fun for the cast than the audience,2,25 March 2008,"It looks pretty, and the cast had a lot of fun making it (going by the bloopers in the credits), so this film is easy enough to kind about; but the gag count is just too low, and what gags there are don't earn their keep. Most are secondhand and there's just never enough at stake to raise the tension. *Spoiler* It's about some acid (that'd be LSD) getting placed in a Valium bottle, and the gay midget lover of the deceased arriving unexpectedly at the funeral. This isn't enough; at first I was waiting for some sort of 'inciting incident' at the beginning. When there wasn't one within half an hour (or was that near miss in the car IT?), I hung on waiting for the bizarre complications to escalate, but DaaF reached a peak round about the time that the midget let the cat out of the bag. Afterwards it just deflated like a half-baked soufflé. I kept expecting a third complication but it never arrived. There's absolutely no wit in the dialogue, just a lot of f-bombs so you can't take your granny, and the plot resolution is lamer than Heather Mills. Two funny points - Alan Tudyk coming on to the acid (but how many times has this been done?) and the brothers putting the two bodies in the '69' position in the coffin. Visual jokes both of 'em. The rest of it is just comedy of embarrassment, which anyone who paid to see this might well be. But for the language it'd be a tolerable ensemble comedy for sleepy Sunday afternoon TV. It's almost as if the actors who didn't get cast in the latest Richard Curtis movie set up on their own.",Death at a Funeral
58,ThurstonHunger,"Not with a Bang, but a Whimper",4,7 June 2008,"I had higher hopes from previews I had seen; inappropriate comedy is up there with dysfunctional family humor for me. This film, being set a funeral, seemed rife with possibility for both.And yet...The film becomes addicted to drug humor, well really one joke reused mercilessly (woops I lost the container again...). To me it almost seemed like I was supposed to laugh at some of the actors for the sake of recognizing them, Andy Nyman and Ewen Bremner in particular. Perhaps in the UK they are analogous to present day Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson (who also make some flops too).And this isn't a total flop, it just never resonates long enough between its better jokes. Eventually it grasps desperately for scatological, and has a sibling rivalry that never reaches a simmer. Much like the film itself, the eulogy in the film after much build-up is surprisingly flat and sophomoric. Death comes not with a bang, but a whimper.Looking over Frank Oz's filmography, I think maybe see his films in a theater when they are released...a crowd could make this experience better. It does not hold well on its own for me, and that also was not helped by big sky image of the film's poster which connoted ""Six Feet Under"" for me.4/10 Thurston Hunger",Death at a Funeral
59,Rickting,"A solid, entertaining and delightfully unpredictable British comedy",7,29 June 2016,"Death at a Funeral is a British black comedy about some very bizarre events which occur at a man's funeral. DAAF is very much a British comedy film, based around embarrassment, awkward situations and a dry, dark sense of humour. The film could easily be replicated on stage, and is refreshingly low key. Being British myself, I love this kind of humour, but this film is sometimes an example of too much of a good thing. Much of the time, the jokes are too subtle to get, and the film doesn't always succeed in making its awkward moments funny and it just becomes cringe-worthy instead. The film takes a little while to get going and there aren't always that many laugh-out-loud moments, but it's still a good film and well worth watching. The acting is all-around awesome with the wonderful Peter Dinklage being as brilliant as ever, many of the gags are very effective and there's a delightful mix of intelligent jokes and surprising tension. It certainly has its flaws, but it is underrated and the American remake (I haven't seen it yet) was the film I was far more aware of.

This film is a welcome back home to Frank Oz,who's directed some major funny comedies,some watchable ones, and even some that fell short of their potential (I won't say,but I'm sure you know what I mean). The cast is made up of mostly unknown (to us Americans,anyway)British actors (although a few familiar faces do pop up,especially Jane Asher,who was Paul McCartney's girlfriend back in the mid 1960's). The story concerns a funeral for the patriarch of an upper class English family. Along the way there are the usual element that makes dysfunctional family comedies what they are. About my only complaint is some rather unnecessary toilet humor that could have easily been left on the cutting room floor (come on England,you're not America,and this isn't your usual mindless Adam Sandler/Rob Schneider fare).

To my experience British comedies have been excellent in the 2000s. Death at a Funeral is almost a classic comedy baring a few misfires. The entire story takes place during a funeral ceremony where the eccentric family members and the friends deal with a dark secret of the deceased. It has an extensive use of pot and poo jokes as the latter was a bit disgusting and out of place for the setting. Performances were apt and subtle by most even while expressing their eccentric best and the story never lags. Special mention should go to Alan Tudyk who gets accidentally drugged with a hallucinogenic pill. It is definitely an enjoyable comedy with quite a few very awkward moments and a heart in the right place.,Death at a Funeral

What angered me most is the depiction of the tripped out guy. I have never seen such unbelievable and inconsistent scripting and acting. For a British comedy the reuniting scene on the rooftop was grabbed from really low in the Hollywood drawer. The whole talented/untalented brother find together in the end thing fits in there too. Beside the characters were clichéd and cheap for a movie that tries to be subtle like this one...

A crisp story not going beyond the house having funeral, comedy which is not slapstick rather quite situational, characters who are serious but are victim of unlikely surprises thrown at them. Movie never tries to do anything fresh but it is quite coherent and works like a little cracker. I am going with good 7 out of 10 for Death at a Funeral.

73,seawalker,"Not bad, but not a masterpiece either",5,7 November 2007,"""Death At A Funeral"" is an old fashioned British farce of dark secrets, misunderstandings, bad taste/poo jokes, and bad behaviour. It features a good cast of familiar British character actors, plus the U.S. actor Alan Tudyk. Everybody is pretty well given equal screen time and something to do, and you would imagine that that they just had a whale of a time on the set, what with all of the running around, the chance to sprout outrageous dialogue with a poker face and, sometimes, the chance to overact wildly. Such a shame, then, that the fun just didn't completely translate onto screen.You see, the problem with farce is that the construction of the story has to be very carefully thought through, and the pace and timing has to be absolutely spot on, for the farce to work. I didn't think that ""Death At A Funeral"" was nearly fast, pacy or frenetic enough, and this was with it only being a short movie - 90 minutes. Sometimes it dragged badly.""Death At A Funeral"" is not a disaster. It does have it's moments, mostly involving Alan Tudyk as Daisy Donovan's nervous fiancé Simon, and Andy Nyman as the put upon Howard. I thought those two actors performances were really funny. (Need I also say that I thought Daisy Donovan is still incredibly sexy? No, I didn't think so.)So... ""Death At A Funeral"" is not bad, but all things being equal, it is not a masterpiece either.",Death at a Funeral

75,johnny-08,Oz delivers us a funny movie,7,27 December 2007,"Yes, I liked this movie. Here in Croatia I have this feeling that the whole nation loves to watch British series and movies. We just love their humor and that is easily seen on our TV were we got lots of British humor. So of course the whole cinema was full when this movie was played and I have to say one thing: there wasn't any person in the whole cinema who didn't laugh at at least one scene in this movie. And it is always important that the viewer is happy, and we all were.So the whole story is happening on a funeral. When Daniel's (Matthew Macfadyen) father dies, it is up to him to organize his funeral. He cannot count on help of his brother Robert (Rupert Graves) cause he's a famous writer and he's not living in that town. His mother is to stressed to help him and it seems like he has only support from his wife Jane (Keeley Hawes). Soon Daniel is ready to welcome his father's friends and relatives, but problems starts there. From his cousin's fiancé who has accidentally took drugs to a mysterious dwarf that nobody knows.There are so many characters and all have their problems, actually none of them seems to be normal. But what is normal? So Frank Oz gives us palette of characters so we can have a good time with them, cause situations in which they seems to find themselves are absolutely strange. This situations can make you laugh or not. I was laughing with everyone in the cinema and this was great movie for me. Before the ending movie enters in some serious tone but that is all broken with that excellent ending (poor Uncle Alfie). Of course the acting is on top. British actors may not be beautiful but their acting is way above their American colleagues on the same level. All the cast is great but I have to extract one actor and he's American. I'm talking about Alan Tudyk. He is great as Simon and he definitely must be a theatrical actor also. Cause Oz knew that he has the most difficult role to act and Tudyk does it with no problems. So if you want to have a good time, go and see this movie cause British dark humor is simply great and they are the masters of this genre.",Death at a Funeral
76,screenwriter-14,"""Who knew?"" A funeral could be this much fun",10,18 August 2007,"From the opening of the credits to the final scene, DEATH AT A FUNERAL is one of the most clever and brilliantly funny films to come along in a long time. A marvelous cast, sensational dialog which moves the story and the characters along ""a mile a minute"" and each gag becomes funnier and funnier until you are bursting your seems with laughter as was so evident today at The ArcLight in Hollywood.I had long waited for this film from the trailer seen months ago and could hardly wait until DEATH AT A FUNERAL opened here in Los Angeles. Yes, it does remind you of FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL, but it has its own take on ""life and death"" and the memories we leave behind for others. So, I advise anyone who wants a real laugh and giggle to see this jewel of a dark comedy, DEATH AT A FUNERAL, before the last vestiges of summer turn to fall.",Death at a Funeral
77,somf,One of the funniest films I have ever seen,10,3 March 2008,"I have tried to come up with 10 comedies that I thought were better and I was not able to do it. Harlod and Maude, Let it Ride,Breaking Away, Withnail and I , and Dr. Strangelove are still my top 5 comedies, but this film falls into my next 5 favorites. The newest film on that list is at least 15 years old. Zoolander, the Austin Powers films, Superbad, and the 40 year old virgin are my favorite comedies in the last decade, and this beats them all except perhaps virgin.Americans who think they don't like British humor should not shy from this film, because it could have been set in New Jersey with barely a line changed. It is however a film for those who like their comedy a bit on the black side.It really revolves around a couple running gags dealing with drugs and closet homosexuality, but the way the gags flow is really fantastic.

The gist of the story is that a man has died, and his sons are having a dignified service at their home with friends and family in attendance. Everything that can go wrong does. More than everything. The cast handles all the situations with the earnestness one would attempt at a parent's funeral, despite the fact that it's screamingly hilarious. The cast is outstanding, and the script is excellent.I have no idea how I missed this movie or even whether it was released in America. I haven't seen Jane Asher in a long time, and it was a pleasure to see her in ""Death at a Funeral.""Highly recommended.",Death at a Funeral
79,Craig_McPherson,Twisted comedy with all the precision of a Rube Goldberg machine,9,11 October 2007,"Death at a Funeral is almost an anachronism in that virtually nobody is making grand farces anymore. Directed by Frank Oz (Bowfinger, the voice of Yoda) and written by Dean Craig, the movie plays out as one large black screwball comedy that, while uneven at times, largely hits all the right notes and makes for some enjoyably twisted viewing.With a large ensemble cast comprised largely of supporting veterans of the British stage and screen, Death at a Funeral tells the story of a rural English funeral for the family patriarch that quickly degenerates into a panoply of gaffes and embarrassments with comic precision akin to one big Rube Goldberg machine.Right from the get go you know this isn't going to be any ordinary, austere gathering when cousin Martha (Daisy Donovan), in an attempt to calm her nervous fiancé Simon (Alan Tudyk) with Valium, mistakenly gives him a powerful hallucinogen during a quick stop to pick up Troy (Kris Marshall), her chemist-in-training/ecstasy-dealing brother.Add to the mix an assortment of family members each with their own various quirks and tics, and the surprise appearance of a homosexual midget (Peter Dinklage of The Station Agent) on a quest to extort hush money from the family to keep him from revealing photographs of his affair with the deceased to his widow, and you have a deliciously warped and twisted setting for an escalating comedy of errors.While Oz takes the credit for having a keen director's eye and spotting the gold in Craig's script, it's the screenplay that is the real star of this film. In lesser hands Death in a Funeral might have veered into little more than a pedestrian comedy. Instead, peppered with sublimely funny dialog and ever-mounting self-perpetuating absurdest scenarios, at its worst it left me grinning from ear-to-ear, and at its best snorting and guffawing out loud.",Death at a Funeral
80,ksdilauri,Probably one of the funniest movies I ever turned off.,1,22 August 2019,"Must be because I'm getting older. Why else would I turn off this movie, ten minutes into it, when I'd so looked forward to seeing it? It has a rep as a quality black comedy, graced by a way talented cast and one of my favorite directors, Frank Oz. Frankly, I just got irked by the excessive profanity. For the record, I've personally won no awards for purity, I do realize the real world isn't a Disney musical, and an R rating will pretty much guarantee some potty-mouth. But the frequency here, just in those few opening scenes, is annoyingly gratuitous and cheapens supposedly intelligent characters. F-bombs, etc, may be increasingly accepted these days (even among TV talk-show hosts) but it's still offensive and unnecessary. Though I'd wanted to see this, I'll pass, just on principle.",Death at a Funeral
81,n-mo,British Black Humor at its Bloody Best!,8,4 March 2008,"Death at a Funeral became one of my favourites almost before I'd left the cinema. Frank Oz masterfully captures the workings of a well-meaning but totally dysfunctional Greater London family, and amidst all the chaos and heartbreak, ends on a heartwarmingly hopeful note that's so rare in today's storytelling.There's just so much TO this movie. Not a moment is wasted on screen; the characters are richly developed and beautifully fleshed out. The ""straight man"" harbours deep-seated anxiety about his writing abilities as well as having to play the man-of-the-house now that his father is gone and not getting any respect for his efforts although no one else will do any dirty work beyond stand up and be seen. His celebrated urbanite literary brother ultimately takes a solid stand for the family. His wife nags him for not considering their future in the midst of preparing for his father's last milestone but she's there for him all the way the minute he needs help. The prim and proper cousin explodes with road rage and then gives herself up to the ultimate public scandal and humiliation to save her fiancé's life. The intelligent but irresponsible uni student watches his life flash before his eyes and dives in to contain the mess he's caused--many of us who have survived university years and escaped with diplomas and without criminal records will doubtless relate to how stupid and blessed we were!And the whole thing is so darned politically incorrect. The main characters belong to a family of at least somewhat observant Anglicans (an extreme rarity in today's Britain), the antagonist is a weaselly homosexual American opportunist; the senile old Uncle Alfie's trials and tribulations punctuate the central conflict to give us one more reminder of the mortality not merely of our youth, or of our body, but our dignity. So far from modern fantasies of the ""Rights"" and ""Dignity"" of Man and ""equality"" of all beings! Everyone in Death at a Funeral burns his dignity at the stake for his loved ones--and not only do they survive, they grow closer!So why did I give this only eight out of ten? I wanted to say it was a perfect film, but it's not. I recognise that some taste is higher than others and I admit that my own standards fall short. And had I been born in better times, I know I should take serious objection to the explicitness with which the sexual and toilet humor is displayed here. But rather than being too hard on the film, we have to grant that this is a problem with all contemporary cinema: subtlety has been thrown out the window. Still, it is hard to complain of selling out for a quick laugh in a film like this, which just keeps the laughs coming one after another. Could it have been more subtle, more witty? Perhaps, but let's not fault this film too much for the rotten epoch in which it was conceived. Certainly it is a positive addition to the cinematic canon--and the fact that it was not even nominated for an Oscar has to at least shed doubt on the Motion Picture Academy's ability to make an objective judgment.",Death at a Funeral

It comprises a modest gentleman taking the wrong drugs, turning him to a hallucinating idiot. There is an old man who complains all the time. He curses when things are going bad.

Of course, what's funny to one person is dumb to another.Let me put it this way, then: In our house, ""Death at a Funeral"" has joined a select group of perennial comedies. That group includes Stanley Tucci and Oliver Platt in ""The Imposters,"" Christopher Guest's ""Best in Show,"" Peter Falk and Alan Arkin in ""The In-Laws"", and John Candy and Eugene Levy in ""The Last Polka."" If you love any of these, you will love ""Death at a Funeral."" Bathroom humor and poop jokes do not normally interest me, but the scene with Uncle Alfie in the bathroom (""Touch and go!

86,rch427,Sadly weak,4,15 November 2010,"Given most of the cast and the premise, I had hoped that ""Death at a Funeral"" would be like ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"". Alas, the former aspires to the latter but is utterly lacking in anything resembling wit. It even starts off the same, with everyone hurriedly driving to the event, and saying ""F**k!"" as often as possible (try to tell me that it isn't ripping off ""Four Weddings...""). Note to filmmakers: it's not particularly funny to have people say ""f**k"" in every sentence, even if they're geriatric. The shock value wears off quickly and it betrays a lack of cleverness, just as it does in real life.We have the usual cast of characters, sketched as broadly as possible. We have people doing the most stupid thing that they could do in any given situation, upon which the plot turns. And when they run out of ideas, there's always potty humor, apparently. Also, throwing on some sappy mood music to accentuate the scene is the weakest of techniques. If we're not feeling the desired emotion or depth of it, no amount of sobbing strings is going to change our minds.In all, I'm sorely disappointed with ""Death at a Funeral"".

We Americans could never pull it off.All the actors are beyond good; deadpan humor, you should pardon the expression. Discovering this film is like watching Monty Python and the Holy Grail for the first time...only better.The premise of a serious, sober occasion, the funeral of a good but unexpectedly flawed man, is unusual to start with. This is a compassionate play dealing with outrageous events happening to vulnerable people. We identify with each one and at the same time secretly gloat that WE would never find ourselves in such a situation!The outright fall down funniest member of the cast is an American, and I don't think the Brits could have pulled off HIS brand of humor.

Oh yes I loved the drug thing and Alan played it so well. Otherwise I had seen it all before. The hard done by brother, the successful and much preferred famous handsome brother. The distraught wife (naturally) the interfering father, the clumsy put upon annoying friend, and the secret homosexual affair, with a person of small stature, all added up to a formulaic farce that was being played out 40 years ago in other British farces a la Brian Rix. including the speech near the end where the put upon brother comes into his own.

108,lornloxor,"A brilliant British farce, one of the funniest comedies ever",10,25 August 2013,"A funeral is really the perfect setting for a British comedy. There's just something about the British and funerals contrasted with all the silliness that's going on that makes me laugh hysterically. The start of the film really sets the tone so well. You think it's going to be something serious but then the screw up by the funeral home's staff immediately changes the tone to a comedy and everything starts to carefully build up to a grand farce of mishaps, secrets and misunderstandings which eventually come together at the film's climax. Farce is definitely a better description for the movie than black comedy because you don't feel guilty when you're laughing at all the horrible things that are happening in the movie.Yes there's crassness in the movie but it is also smart, subtle and it has a ton of heart. You need to have patience with this film in the start though because it carefully builds up the setting and tension and puts the needed pieces in place in the beginning for the later hilarious scenes to work as intended. When the comedy really starts going, boy is it worth the wait! The way the family tries to deal with the problems in secret while also trying to keep the funeral going is absolute comedy gold. The disruptions of calmness and decency the British appreciate are expertly crafted in this film.The cast does a wonderful job. Andy Nyman does an especially awesome job as a hypochondriac stressing about his skin condition (he just can't catch a break!). Alan Tudyk absolutely steals the show, his reactions and behavior during the funeral are so comical (loved that guy on Tucker and Dale vs. Evil by the way) and he can do a surprisingly good British accent. Matthew Macfadyen was a great choice to play the straight-faced son who is in charge of the funeral arrangements. Peter Vaughan as Uncle Alfie was also entertaining as the slightly anachronistic swearing old uncle. There's really too many good performances here to count them, everyone simply acts fantastically. What was also great was that the many characters aren't put there just to do one thing but they're cleverly woven into many hilarious subplots. The music is used sparingly but when it's used it definitely enhances the comedic moments well. Oh and that toilet scene, wow, I've probably never laughed that hard. Gross-out humor is used where it's appropriate and the situation and the characters are properly primed for to get those priceless reactions. Man, I wish I could watch this movie over and over again without knowing that I've watched it before. It's just such a perfectly crafted farce.

'Interstate 60', 'Smokin' Aces', and '11:14' are a few other examples of this kind of cheap-on-ideas film making, and sadly the list of such films is growing at a fairly fast rate. In 'Interstate 60' we had the simple idea of a leprechaun sending a guy down a road that wasn't on any map and didn't exist in our dimension, and once on that road he visited a bunch of crazy towns and people. Great, how brilliant. Did it take 10 minutes to think up that story, or was it 15? In 'Smokin' Aces' we have the word spreading about a hit, and every insane killer in the country races to the spot to be the one to do the job. Throw in some queer-a*se kung foo kid and a bunch of crazy punks that just want to kill and destroy, and you've got the empty spaces of the film filled out. Brilliant. I reckon 5 minutes would have seen the writing of that one. 11:14' saw a bunch of events take place at the same time, and the director said ""ok, now I'll make several people in several different places all get tied into these events in some way or another, and lastly I'll chop the story up with scissors and keep the audience guessing. Naturally they'd be guessing. How can you predict a story that's in pieces or going backwards, no matter how simple it is. And so we come to 'Death At A Funeral'. Once again the plot is simple; hang on, THERE ISN'T EVEN A PLOT! A man dies and everyone comes to pay their last respects. Is that a plot? Now let's throw in a mis-labelled jar of acid, a homosexual affair between the deceased and a midget, a rude and immobile old man with loose bowels, a friend of the family who is a complete jerk, a disgruntled father, a 'tripping' boyfriend, and at last we've really got ourselves a story! Sorry, but we haven't. The film is beautifully shot, the actors are all terrific, their superb timing of delivery and the effort they put in is unquestionable, but without a story of any kind, is there really a point?",Death at a Funeral

Oz does just that here, with American actors Alan Tudyk and Peter Dinklage exceptions (as chauvinistic as that sounds), as is Peter Vaughn as irascible Uncle Alfie . The plot is the main problem: it's mostly as inert as the dead body at the center of it. It may be dead-body farces need to actually move the body around a bit more (see Weekend at Bernies, The Trouble With Harry, etc.); in any case, the story here never reaches the manic pace a good farce requires. There just aren't enough slammed doors and compromising positions – or more accurately, the stakes of the story are too mild. So what if your dead dad was gay? Is that really as upsetting as finding your wife's lover under the bed? Is it anywhere near as funny? This story is unfunny, unexciting and unattractively peopled with bland Brits. Again, it's the script that's the problem and there's no way this story will kick into gear even with a high- spirited black American cast in the remake.",Death at a Funeral
112,mgoldhamer,Death at a Funeral: humor before the grave.,10,14 June 2007,"The laughs begin during the animated credits which prepares the film going public for the buffoonery to follow. Death at a Funeral (DaaF) is directed by Frank Oz. Because of the nature of this film I believe Mr. Oz is paying homage to the late, great, director, Robert Altman, particularly his film A Wedding. Both A Wedding and DaaF are both off beat, extremely, funny, and very non-typical of weddings and funerals, in which they both portray. In tribute to Mr. Altman, Mr. Oz also uses an ensemble cast of well known actors by face but not by name. The audience has seen their work and in this film they most definitely make you laugh. This is an adult comedy with an R rating for adult themes, nudity, recreational drug use, religious issues, postmortem issues, and the absurdity about death. Remember this is an adult comic opera taken to the extreme. At this funeral the mourners may come with their inhabitation's in check but due to the outlandish antics of many of the other grievous members assembled, all of the gathered, loose all claim to sanity. The audience becomes one with the collected zany members of this grieving group. Since the players on film have lost their inhabitation's so to does the audience. Remember this is an adult, knee slapping, laugh out loud farce. This film is outrageously funny, in an adult vein, not intended for children. If you go to a sporting event, after you have paid for your ticket and bought your seat, people around you cheer, yell, scream and sometimes even in funny costumes as well. A film house is the same communally shared type of experience and environment for entertainment but patrons of the silver screen tend to hold their laughter within, as of being afraid of upsetting the patron in the next seat. Is it not time to unshackle this age old concept and enjoy yourself along with others? I am certain that is the reason why Frank Oz made this film, so the audience could laugh and laugh at themselves. I personally want to thank you Mr. Oz for the laughter and the comedy of Death at a Funeral.",Death at a Funeral

There was not a line in the film that a well-educated and slightly sophisticated 12 year old could not have improved upon. There were no surprises, and little more than a series of stereotypes (the incontinent and foul-mouthed old guy, the hypochondriac, the dutiful son surrounded by bizarre relatives, the proper lawyer who inadvertently gets stoned, and the stoner son who spends his time looking for a lost stash). And not a single well-drawn female role. The direction was predictable and tedious. Most of the actors seem to have been embarrassed to be associated with the project.

The funeral spiced with romance, hallucinatory drugs, dark secrets, unrealized desires and some classic blackmailing when the family has to come together and confront with each other. As mysteriously guest is threatening to reveal the skeletons in the closet, family members are pushed to the limit, and a little beyond. I usually don't like British movie but this one was just amazing. there's something about people ""in high"" that makes you just laugh even if they don't say anything.

After watching 2010 version I understood how perfectly the 2007 version is made. It has perfect funny actors whose acting is brilliant. I watched the 2007 version again and this time I was laughing! 2010 version made this movie look great. I am correcting my vote to 10. First voting was 4.

116,dingoberserk,"A disappointing, boringly predictable sitcom",3,16 January 2008,"It seems that in the current decade a movie worth its salt must have three basic trendy ingredients: coarse language galore, drug- taking and the now universally obligatory gay couple (with one of the partners preferably married to a woman and/or bisexual). These criteria are admirably fulfilled in 'Death at a funeral', and the result is one ongoing 90-minute long yawn, entirely predictable situations and tired gags. Oh, for the innocence and charm of the romantic Hollywood comedies back in the 50s! I suspect that, sooner or later, the great unwashed public will tire of movies reflecting fringe interests and creating improbable, pseudo-titillating sketches.

I initially watched this version because I am a big fan of Alan Tudyk and once I saw Peter Dinklage was also in it I made it a point to watch this version first. I was not disappointed. Tudyk was amazing and Dinklage played his part expertly. I then watched the US version with my parents and a few of my aunts. I figured they would prefer the US version since we are from the US and it would be easier for them to get into. James Marsden was serviceable but I thought Tudyk played the part better. All in all the movie was a hit and my parents and aunts were literally rolling on the floor with laughter, as i did when I watched the UK version. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who has a sense of humor and ignore the bad reviews. I mean, all you have to do is look at what they suggest is better.

119,jboyaquar,All the elements were there...,5,17 December 2007,"but its presentation fell flat and grew quite grating. None of the characters were especially warm-hearted and and yet the humor wasn't scathing or memorably malicious enough to be interesting. There were only a couple of quotable one-liners and the situations weren't particularly innovative or unique. When an adult farce filled resorts to multiple moments of scatological humor, there's a problem brewing. In the 21st century - the 'secret' was a letdown. Oz can fill a minute film without many lulls, but some of these characters were downright annoying. Adam Nyman's 'Howard' was an example. His pestering skin problems were never entertaining and his only function appeared to increase the number of problems everyone had to face. Characters like 'Howard' are appealing when a layer of sweetness or tender humanity is revealed...but that wasn't there. Matthew Macfayden's 'Daniel' was the de facto protagonist - but he was portrayed so wimpy and without conviction I couldn't rally behind him. Stephen Fry has a similar appearance - but he brings an authority to his roles that Matthew couldn't match. 'Simon' was silly, not a riot. 'Martha' responded with the personality of a sitcom actress. On the bright side - it doesn't overstay its welcome and Peter Dinkledge is always a joy. If he wasn't so physically limited, he would have been a big star.",Death at a Funeral

Most jokes can be seen coming minutes ahead of reaching the screen. And most jokes are just lame. Some make you chuckle for two seconds, one or two make you smile but none are really funny. The story is very inconsistent. SPOILER COMING The movie takes place, as you may have guessed, at a funeral. And at the end of the movie the son very sincerely has font memories of his father. But none of the characters seems very grief stricken during the proceedings. Some may grief for a few minutes but most of the time the don't seem to remember where they are or why funerals are held.

The unending chaos hinged mostly on one thing: The fact that the idiot pharmacy student kept losing his bottle of ""Valium"" which actually contained very strong hallucinogens. What kind of idiot would put such things in a Valium bottle, first of all, and, second, not keep a very strong eye on the bottle at all times? I mean, to some people, the contents were pure poison! If you had a bottle of arsenic, would you just casually keep ""losing"" it? I personally hate hallucinogens and know that if I were forced to take them (again), I would just lose it altogether, maybe forever! That is NOT funny to me! I would have much preferred it if the ""victims"" in this movie knew full well what they were ingesting and, perhaps, that what they ingested were something more benign, like marijuana.At any rate, this movie was rather slapstick, I felt.

If you took out the hallucinogenic drugs, nudism and toilet gags Death At A Funeral could almost be a period piece. All the envisaged family feuds, embarrassing revelations and frantic entrances and exits are present and correct, only here when someone drops their trousers, the focus is on what soils the underpants rather than the underpants themselves.

If Shakespeare were doing film today, this would certainly be among his works! The fact that it was remade in Hollywood is testament to the appeal of an obviously good script. The fact that the original creators felt they had to sell it to Hollywood for extra revenue is also actually kind of depressing to think about.

Such a difference of opinion meant I had to see it.There's much said about the difference between the US/UK sense of humour but personally I think, at least in TV terms, the US leaves us standing. Which is why I find it strange that people outside the UK seem to like this film. For the benefit of US viewers, most of the cast are top notch UK actors. And you'll know that Frank Oz has made some decent films. But this is so awful it made me genuinely angry.I stayed with it because I read that, despite a slow start, it gathers momentum into a kind of Fawlty Towers farce/comedy of errors. I was still waiting at the end. It was hard to watch, a film so awful it made me feel that somehow it was all my fault, and it was too late to do anything about it.Its a shame that such a great character actor as Peter Vaughan (Uncle Alfie) is used in such a demeaning way.

At first you will snicker, then grin, then laugh out loud and finally you'll be guffawing at the uproarious hilarity of the situations as the clever writing, excellent acting and outrageous situations build to a gut-splitting climax!

I really wasn't sure what it was until I read some other comments here and then I realised that it's really not a typical British film even though it's trying very hard to be one. The problem is a distinct lack of subtlety. If you watch any of the Ealing comedies or Carry-On films, you don't actually hear people cursing or see people covered in human excrement even though the implication might be there.

I have to report that I found the various attempts to provoke laughter either crass, embarrassing, crude, or in downright bad taste. Cadaver falls out of coffin. Yeah, hilarious. Man helping paraplegic to sit on toilet gets excrement on his hand and face. A real kneeslapper. Dwarf ends up in coffin with his dead lover's body. And so it continues Of course, humor is highly subjective, and I still find hard to believe accounts of people roaring at this little dirty silly film. Subjective notions of humor aside, there is plenty wrong with this film. I am immediately suspicious of movies in which foul language is used as a substitute for funny lines. Uncle Alfie announces his arrival on screen with a spray of obscenities and his character never rises far above that level. Something else that sticks out a mile is that practically every actor is firmly in autopilot mode. Rupert Graves in particular looks as though he was wishing he was somewhere else; and what an actor of the stature of Jane Asher is doing in this little number is anyone's guess. That she is absolutely appalling can most likely be put down to a combination of a commensurately wretched script, and criminal miscasting.

The actors are the only thing that makes this higher than a 2 or 3 on my list. They are not at fault - they did the best they could with what was given to them. It's just the most boring script full of obvious lines and situations. I saw this tonight in a preview with a Q&A with Frank Oz and Alan Tudyk afterward. I have real respect for them and the cast - they got a movie made for 10 million. It has good production values and a good cast. It's just not funny and it's too obvious throughout. IMHO.

135,damittaja,A tedious farce,5,26 April 2013,"The name of the movie tells you pretty much what to expect combined with the categorization ""comedy"". There was plenty of ""funny"" stuff to go around but unfortunately for my movie experience those funny accidents and coincidences were not funny at all. Well, there was a nice five minute bit near the end of the movie when a lot things that were bizarre enough to make me laugh happened at a frisk pace but you have to bear like 75 minutes of utter boredom to reach those bits.I think Alan Tudyk had the best performance of the cast. What happened with his character was not really believable, but at least some segments of the movie with him made me chuckle. On the other hand Thomas Wheatley made a horrible performance as the Reverend (well, his acting was not necessarily horrible but the character was the least believable of the lot). The other actors did an OK performance but the boring plot did not leave them any chances to shine. It might well be that I found most of the plot boring because it was just so easy to guess what would happen next at any given point of the movie. I've only rarely watched through a movie that has been as predictable as this one and this predictability kills the comedy part of the script. I get the feeling that the scriptwriter always chose the safe option when he/she was thinking of what would happen next.The locale for the events in the movie was quite believable in my opinion. The amount of people attending the funeral made the place feel alive and like if it was an actual funeral.

However, once things picked up, everything just took off and I enjoyed every moment. I also enjoyed how everything just came together for this film. Half-way through I was thinking about what a hot mess it was. Not in terms of the movie itself but in terms of the situations within the movie. I was hoping that the movie would not lose its focus and allow these incidents to give it a weak ending. Luckily, it did not and the ending, while a tad predictable in places, was very good and very funny. I wish that I'd watched this film sooner.

The women actors were good, but the movie is most definitely about the men. There are elements of Four Weddings and a Funeral, but I think it owes most of its success to the classic British farces of the Fifties and Sixties.

141,Rick_Swift,British foolish farce masterpiece!,8,27 July 2009,"British farce comedy at its finest, this is not pretentious and annoying like so so many other British scripts, you know the ones I mean – Four Weddings and a Funeral, the Bridget Jones series, anything starring Hugh Grant opposite another British lead. This was a guy's comedy, it is chock full of every type of humor imaginable, and while romance plays an integral part in the foolish farce, the real moments of comedy brilliance splash around in the gutter.I love Alan Tudyk from 28 Days, Serenity and many more – always an impressive force on the screen, and while some would say he is over the top, his death scene in Serenity should surely shut his critics, soundly . . . up. I am going to be sentenced to grammar hell for that sentence. Am I giving you a headache yet? Take some Valium, dear. Peter Dinklage will stand out to many indie film lovers, he reminds me of a friend of mine from college – his acting style is classic and wonderful. Probably the guy who gets the, ""I can't believe he committed to that"" award goes to Andy Nyman – who really feces his fears.The British cast may not appeal to many of my American friends, but you should recognize a few of the more memorable faces, and since this is Directed by Yoda – like it you will, or Miss Piggy will have to kick you – HIYA! Yes, it was directed by Frank Oz, no relation to Dorothy. And, yes, European actors tend not to come out of some Sneetch factory with their hair all perfect and their bodies toned. Still, I think that is what makes the casting excellent, the characters could very easily exist – and, I am sure we all will recognize certain friends or family members in some of them. Best of all with this script though, nothing unbelievable ever happens – so, be wary of the next funeral you attend. And for God's sake, have some couth, please.If you don't laugh at this one, I think you would fail my Frasier test. That's the one where I make a potential mate watch Frasier and if she doesn't laugh at least twice in an episode – well, let's just say she doesn't get to meet mom.Oh no, I see there is an American version of this film slotted to release in 2010 – please don't muss it about, you Yank, Chris Rock! Yes, I said Chris Rock (completely different comedic style), I am hopeful though; the new version will apparently retain the always inspirational Peter Dinklage who keeps the punch spiked throughout Frank Oz' version.If you can catch this sucker on cable, treat yourself on a day when you are taking things a little too seriously – it'll make you smile.",Death at a Funeral
142,katparker-86462,Hilarious comedy- a very good late night watch.,7,3 January 2019,"Death at a Funeral has a distinct Four Weddings and a Funeral feel. This movie is more amusing that many so-called American comedies at their peaks. Director Frank Oz's credentials as the helmsman of funny movies are well established - he steered such productions as What About Bob?, In & Out, and Bowfinger. Improbably, this is a perfect choice for him, and the result ends up being a fusion of his off-kilter style and screenwriter Dean Craig's zaniness. Embarrassment may be the soil of British comedy, but the cringe-inducing fertilizer is all American. Death at a Funeral is flawed, but I'm willing to forgive a lot of flaws when a movie makes me laugh as much as this one. Despite being directed by a Yank, Death at a Funeral has a very British flavour. In fact, at times it reminded me of nothing less than an extended episode of Fawlty Towers, minus the manic genius of John Cleese. The film begins slowly, with occasional low-key laughs widely spread. However, it then does something too few comedies achieve: it builds momentum. The closer we get to the end credits, the faster and more furious the jokes come, until they're tumbling all over one another. The film's climax is nothing short of hilarious.",Death at a Funeral
143,Tom-464,"A truly awful, mean-spirited attempt at humor",2,18 August 2007,"A lot of people who see ""Death at a Funeral"" say it's funny. The movie's poster even quotes some reviewers as saying it's funny. It's not. It's a mean-spirited, insulting, pathetic attempt at crude humor, and it fails miserably. If your idea of humor is watching other people be insulted, humiliated, manipulated, and debased, then this is the movie for you. It is not, however, a movie for people with even a modicum of decency, self-respect, or intelligence.I've been seeing trailers for it for months now; and now that I've seen the movie itself, I understand why. It must have taken the releasing company that long to be able to hold their nose and release it to theaters, rather than directly to DVD, which is where it belongs.",Death at a Funeral
144,pedrodebiasi,A British comedy that should have stayed in England.,3,8 November 2007,"While British comedies tend to be funny, ""Death at a Funeral"" comes to America as an exception: it is just a boring movie with a few inspired moments, uneven gags, an irregular cast and a terrible editing.Director Frank Oz chose to make fun out of any kind of possible situation that could happen anywhere, barely exploring the peculiar scenario (the funeral). There is witty humor (pretty rare), black humor, there is scatology, there is slapstick, there are subtle jokes, there are prejudicial jokes, all of them mixed up together to make viewers laugh at any cost. Too many comedic formats in one movie are a sign of uncertainty and lack of confidence, and, ultimately, very few jokes work. The rare use of the average score is another problem, that makes silent moments really annoying.One of the only ones is the doped Simon, which provokes laughs every time he appears. Unfortunately, with the poor editing, what could be fun just gets boring. Dialogues are cut in the middle, jokes are left for dead, characters are piled up then scattered around in numerous cuts, making the editing a fault, when it should be an asset to make the movie better. The first 30 minutes of film are almost unbearable, with jokes that do not work (the 'wrong coffin', the tedious opening credits), and some gags don't even look like gags. Maybe, for British people, seeing a man on a suit and underwear is funny, but, on this side of the Atlantic, it is just whatever.It is strange how a black humor comedy got so messed up, since inadequate jokes about death or cadavers would work already. When Simon drops the coffin and the dead man rolls to the floor, it was also supposed to be funny, but that kind of bad-taste jokes are somewhat overrun, and the scene ends up not very funny, indeed. Actually, the only thing that elevates the quality of ""Death at a Funeral"" is the great use of the few good jokes  for an example, the acid trip goes on in the entire movie - , and some of its actors.MacFayden is the serious type, and his dull ending speech is too cliché, but he turns out well. Donovan and Marshall just dumbly repeat lines and accidents throughout the movie  she comforts her drugged boyfriend, and he loses his bottle of drugs all the time - , while Howard's nice part is played reasonably well by Andy Nyman. Dinklage comes as the surprise of the cast, in a believable and spirituous performance. The highlight, truth be told, is Alan Tudyk. He trips during the whole movie, and the dumb-dumberer scenes only work because of his impeccable comic timing.This film has everything a comedy mustn't have: a bombardment of irregular jokes, a weak direction by Frank Oz, a screenplay that offers but a few original and funny situations and an overall lack of humor. It is not impossible to laugh, of course, but ""Death at a Funeral"" ultimately shows that is not only Hollywood who produces bad comedies.",Death at a Funeral
145,bugandlolly,One of the best films I've seen!,10,15 July 2014,"Yup, I give this film a 10! I absolutely adored it. Incredibly funny, wonderfully acted, amazing cast and a simply brilliant screenplay. It is a farce but never goes over the top and I found myself laughing out loud, something I seldom do. I love, love, LOVE Peter Dinklage! I discovered him in the ""Station Agent"" (another excellent film that I highly recommend) and I intend to check out all his films, but the entire cast is marvelous. The story is one that easily could have devolved into slapstick but never does and the results are hilarious. This is a clever, well acted, well directed film that not only leaves you smiling but ready to watch it again and again and again because it is simply so much fun. All the characters are charming in their own way, even the villainous Dinklage, who is certainly the ""dark"" character but who is far less villainous, if you listen to his reasoning, than he might initially seem. How often are viewers given the chance to watch an utterly engaging comedy that portrays people as they so often are, a muddle of good qualities and not so good qualities, the stuff that makes us all human. This is a quirky, offbeat film that I would recommend to anyone in need of a good, light hearted laugh and aren't we all?",Death at a Funeral

Two people enter the room and one person gives the other a pill from the valium bottle. They go to a funeral where the taker has hallucinations and very predictable stuff happens. Then at the end there is the compulsory morality speech. It is tripe and I would really like to see the notes that must have been made at the production meeting where someone agreed to stump up the money for this unfunny, drivel. It might be worth noting that Jane Asher has a range of own-brand cooking products that can be bought only at Poundland, for £1 each. And, because of the vapid nature of the writing quality used to make this production, Rupert Graves could easily be tempted to bring out an exclusive range of bin liners for sale in 99p Store or Matthew Macfadyen wouldn't say no if he was asked to be the front man for a range of one-use plastic food boxes.",Death at a Funeral
148,londonpaul,"Funniest movie I've seen in a very, very long time!!",9,27 November 2007,"Sometimes directors use their funniest bits right at the beginning to make you think there's more funny stuff to come but there isn't: they've already used their best stuff. Not so in this movie. And even when you thought it couldn't be any funnier, without giving anything away, the best was saved for the last. I was sick with laughter at what you might call the climactic funny bit in the last five minutes of the movie. Although there are quite a few plot lines to keep track of, as there are many couples each with their own story, they're all intermixed with each other, but only the audience knows it. During the movie, my friend pointed out that it reminded him for all the world of a Robert Altman masterpiece, where he can manage a large cast with a variety of subplots and still keep the audience interested, not unlike what he did in ""A Wedding."" This is for sure one movie you'll find funny each time you watch it. And don't be afraid it's one of those high-brow have-to-think-about-it funny English comedies because it isn't. Everyone will enjoy this movie, although they might have left out some of the strong language so a larger audience could watch it.

There had been some comments about cruel humor, which I just didn't see. The story was well structured, with groundwork laid early on for very funny bits much later in the film that got us laughing hard without hitting us over the head with the joke. The moments of comic tension were good, without that excruciating sense that someone was going to be horribly embarrassed, or hurt, or whatever, that American films seem to have. The situation is very well known to everyone who's been to a family funeral, although in America we would have the service in a funeral home or church, and we've all had moments when we want to laugh at the wrong time, or notice something a little out of the ordinary in the service that seems to cry out for comment. My husband, 14 year old daughter and I enjoyed the film immensely, and we all gave it an 8 out of 10, with some good carryover lines to quote amongst ourselves.

This is what makes the film so hilarious. I do feel that this film could have been generic had the wrong actors been chosen, but the actors in the movie really made ""Death at a Funeral"" exceed my expectations by a lot. Each character has his/her own quirks that keep the group from being anything but normal , but it seems as the film goes on, everyone pulls together, albeit in a non-conventional way. This is not your conventional, run-of-the-mill film family...but really, their imperfections are what made them so real. The performances were exceptional and believable.

However I stopped. I was wrong AGAIN. All those small details pictured a funny yet meaningful story. Not only it brought us laughters, more importantly, it gave us a chance to watch ourselves in the movie.

One particular highlight was the toilet scene which had me rolling with laughter. What I like the most (and alluding to the title of my comments), was the way the film unfolded, from several small seeds, the story grows into chaos with main character Daniel barely keeping control of the proceedings.

Point 1 : the script is utterly witless. Not a single clever line in the whole thing. I would challenge anyone who loves this film to quote a funny line. OK. You could say it's slapstick - the humour is in the action. So why is most of its running time taken up with very unpleasant people yelling unfunny things at each other? This is a film made for boomers who still find the idea of old people swearing hilarious, who still think stoned people are just a riot and who still rate poo jokes as the most hysterical fun.

159,jesterification,Predictable But Funny Nonetheless,8,6 November 2007,"Death At A Funeral features a fairly rounded cast of actors you don't quite expect to see in a comedy. Matthew MacFadyen's sad 'kicked puppy' expression is perfect for the role of hapless Daniel while Alan Tudyk essentially steals the show. There have been complaints of 'homophobia' in the plot, but I think it's simply people being overly sensitive to any notion of the sort and not any genuine prejudice to homosexuality. The reactions of the characters are honest and, quite frankly speaking, to be expected of anyone in such a situation. On a slightly dull side, the plot follows a fairly predictable route of pretty classic gags. But regardless of its lack of originality, even the most repeated jokes can still be funny if presented right. This film does this quite magnificently, providing some good laughs without being stale.",Death at a Funeral

The final shot is worth the price of admission, if only for the composition-nicely done. The whole movie was ""sparce"", in a good way. No wasted anything, everything On-Point and well done.

161,gthiele,Wretched,1,4 June 2008,"I think I've used this line before, but, here goes: I refuse to believe that this is the worst film ever made. I simply won't have it... It's a bit like that line in Fawlty Towers, where the exasperated American guest says to Basil: ""This is the lousiest, crummiest hotel in the whole of Western Europe!"", at which the Major interjects: ""No! I won't have that! (Pause) There's a place in Eastbourne"" So what's wrong with it (this film, not Basil Fawlty's hotel)? I will start by suggesting that the least one ought to be able to expect of a comedy is that it should be funny. I have to report that I found the various attempts to provoke laughter either crass, embarrassing, puerile, crude, cringe worthy, or in downright bad taste. Cadaver falls out of coffin. Yeah, hilarious. Man helping paraplegic to sit on toilet gets excrement on his hand (and face). A real thigh slapper. Dwarf ends up in coffin with his dead lover's body. Highly risible. And so it continues Of course, humour is a highly subjective animal, and I have to believe accounts of people roaring at this little turkey. I submit, however, that great  or even good - comedy films will stand the test of time: the gags will still be funny at second or third viewing. I am not confident that time will treat DAAF too kindly. Subjective notions of humour aside, there is plenty wrong with this film. I am immediately suspicious of movies in which foul language is used as a substitute for funny lines. Uncle Alfie announces his arrival on screen with a spray of obscenities; and his character never rises far above that level. Something else that sticks out a mile is that practically every actor is firmly in autopilot mode. Rupert Graves in particular looks as though he was wishing he was somewhere else; and what an actor of the stature of Jane Asher is doing in this little number is anyone's guess. That she is absolutely appalling can most likely be put down to a combination of a commensurately wretched script, and criminal miscasting.

The comparisons to the old John Cleese series Fawlty Towers are apt, so if you like F.T. there's a good chance you'll enjoy this.I found it absolutely hilarious, in a (yes) old-fashioned and (maybe) easy, but irresistible way.

Comedy is edgy enough for teens to enjoy although overall it will probably appeal to slightly older audiences. It would be great if this could do a Four Weddings.

The terribly sombre opening sequence was fractured by a rather unfortunate mishap, and from that point, honest and genuine laughter burst forth.So as not to spoil, let it be said, the movie ties in an intricate series of unfortunate mishaps as tightly as the weaving of a microfibre.The various characters in this movie are grieving, fretting, stressing, ripped, angry, dead, nude, suicidal, disabled, anxious, stupid and in urgent need of a toilet.When one experiences any of these phenomena, one finds it not only less than amusing, indeed, somewhat stressful however the writers of this screenplay have magically succeeded in making all of these unfortunate circumstances hilarious.This wonderful movie vicariously allows us to tap in to ""Murphy's Law""; that which can go wrong, will go wrong.Forget about political incorrectness - cut lose and enjoy a belly laugh!

A family trying to deal with the loss of a husband, father and relative. Also there are antics that you could never imagine happening through out the ceremony that are unbelievable; secrets revealed, professions of love and one person loosing his mind. I am surprised that Frank Oz directed it because I am so used to associating him with the Muppets. The actors really made you believe what was going on around them. There was nothing corny about the movie and it involved sophisticated humor rather than relying on toilet humor. I think that it is simple enough that everyone can understand what is going in the story.

With its pathetic, charmless and tired clichés for characters, mixed with the usual borrowings from that 4 Weddings film, this is a movie to miss, notwithstanding the politely positive reviews that certain other irredeemably Anglophile IMDb members have given it.As with so many similar comedy films of late, all the best gags are shown in the trailer, and the full length context does nothing but detract from them.",Death at a Funeral

Alan Tudyk the best American actor in my view who can do an English accent(as he did in A Knights Tale) without thinking we are all Cockneys, Andy Nyman as Howard, if you don't laugh at what happens to him later in the film by Uncle Alfie you must have a screw loose, Peter Vaughan as cantankerous disabled Uncle Alfie, harking back to his days as a heavy in British films/television. Ewen Bremner as sleaze Justin, Peter Dinklage as Peter trying to get what he thinks is his. Actually all the actors give cracking turns.

First of all, where I am from we grew up with British comedy (Fawlty Towers, Some Mothers Do Have 'Em etc etc etc), and so I can say I certainly appreciate good old British slapstick. In fact many of my favorite recent movies had followed in such vain (Hot Fuzz springs immediately to mind). But this movie is just bad. It's really not that funny. It is saved by a few Freudian moments but otherwise I feel it relies on overusing blasphemy to get a cheap laugh (just moments where people swore and they didn't need to).The people out there claiming to be British comedy experts and giving THIS rave reviews quite simply do not know what they are talking about. Sorry. This film is a rental quality effort and no more.",Death at a Funeral

Cast, script, editing, story, the ending remaining true to previous 90 minutes. Everything about Death At A Funeral works ... as long as you like British actors running around in a breathless farce.It would be remiss of me to spoil any of this wonderful movie for you. Suffice to say that there's a wake for a dead dad and everything goes wrong ... as long as you can handle a lot of cursing, you'll love this film.It's one of those movies you can invite friends over to watch and enjoy yourself a week after you first saw it. The characters are so well played that it's hard to say who the standouts are but Alan Tudyk as a lawyer unknowingly whacked out of his face on acid, Andy Nyman as a guest with an ""skin discoloration"" and Ewan Bremner as the Ex who doesn't get it deserve special mention as they do their best to steal every scene they are in.Put the kids to bed, grab a beer and prepare to laugh your arse off!

I thought it would be a dreadful Four Weddings and a Funeral indie. But right in I fell for the movie. The movie is silly and funny and a bit absurd in the best ways. Perhaps in script form maybe it wouldn't have sounded so great but really this film is a great 90 minutes of entertainment. Frank Oz has made some classics and this right up there with them.

Great acting like you can expect from them!This movie is like Festen but then at a funeral which makes it already quite awkward but this is much better: it is dramatic and funny at the same time.. and the comedy is just like you expected if you know this is from the UK..The way if film builds itself is just brilliant; it starts very sincere but then it unleaches... and you cant stop laughingGo and and check it out if you like British humor!

E.g., the pill idea was good, but drawn out WAY too long. And then recycled three times??!!Was the budget for writers really that low?

I will never understand why Alan Tudyk did not get more award nominations. I guess because it is the curse of comedies and British to boot. He made me fall off my chair laughing. I guess it was a little high brow for most theatre going folks. Everybody is part of a family and if your family isn't slightly dysfunctional at times, well, God bless you. Funerals and weddings is always where this stuff comes out. Secrets are revealed. Peter Dinklage gives a stand out performance.

I must admit i was shocked when i found out it was going to be a comedy and wondered how this would work with the title and subject matter. To say i was pleasantly surprised would be the understatement of the year! I found this film to be witty, ironic and incredibly funny. With chaos being the main theme throughout, this film keeps you laughing on several levels; with overt jokes and slapstick comedy and subtle lines and body language. It is very clever and had me holding my aching stomach from laughing so much. The cast is perfect, especially the accidentally drugged fiancé Simon (i'm not sure who plays him but he puts in a fantastic performance) and Kris Marshall who is wonderfully funny in whatever role he plays.

I rented the movie on that premise alone. I absolutely loved the humor. Nothing is better than moments where you just burst out in laughter. THAT is what I look for in a comedy. One thing for sure - if you don't get British humor, or you don't think British is funny, this isn't the movie for you. The cast is amazing! There were a bunch of faces that I recognized but I didn't know their names.

One clever and subtle, the other juvenile and in your face.Although there was a lot of cleverness and humor, that was well sustained, much of the more subtle and intelligent humor that is typically associated with British humor was made blindingly obvious for America audiences.And when one of the guests got poop on his hands, the audience howled uncontrollably. And when he got it on his face, they guffawed and howled even more. It seems like the audience at the showing we went to was a bunch of old geezers with the humor level of a six year old.Nevertheless, there was some clever acting, and the editing and comedic timing was very snappy and well done.If you like poop jokes and want a good old laugh along, go see it at a cinema. If you want to hear some of the clever dialog otherwise drowned out by the laughter at the more juvenile and obvious, then rent it as a DVD.",Death at a Funeral

Quite a lot a jokes have been seen before, and is it reaally funny if one has faeces on his fingers?? acting is great, a lot of new faces, everything is well done, but the plot itself lacks a lot what I expect from an outstanding movie. If you make a movie about an English funeral, you have a lot of competition. The conflicts in the family are well outlined, but almost no change happens. In better scripts there is a kind of psychological catharsis. This is not a bad movie, of course, but if you give 10 points here, what will you give a Lubitsch, or Wilder or a Fish called Wanda. I have seen better Simpson episodes than this.",Death at a Funeral

Talk about saying goodbye to your father in a decent and heartwarming manner... Add a few doses of acid and some minor mistakes along the road and you got yourself one very good dark comedy!

Peter Egan,Jane Asher, the wonderful actor who provides the ""Valium"",Rupert Graves, and the first acid trip was funny, but that joke got pretty old by the end. Peter Dinklage is great and shows what a terrific actor he is. Actually, saw this movie a second time with a friend and they loved it. I have to admit that I did laugh more the second time around. Had clever moments and was worth seeing a second time. Also worth seeing for the ensemble of actors and to support more British and Irish films. They are just funnier than American movies and the acting is better. Well, let me update that remark: I LOVE all of Christopher Guests' movies, especially ""Best in Show"". If you've ever been to a dog show in America, it's pretty spot-on. Back to Frank Oz's movie: I bought the DVD and have watched numerous times now. You can always skip by the parts that you've seen and are ready to skip, but there are many funny ones, and again, with this ensemble of actors you cannot miss finding funny and silly moments worth remembering. Plus the special features are great. To see these WONDERFUL actors/actresses blow their lines, make each other laugh, and simply hear what Frank Oz went through to make this film, is pure pleasure. As we've all experienced, movies can ""grow"" on you as you watch them and discover things you'd miss previously. This is one of those movies.

Great lines, great acting. The cast really stands out. Every situation was set up amazingly and logically. British have done a great job in this and far more better than the American ver.

The story is well crafted so that even when the audience was laughing to hard to hear all the dialog at no point did I loose track of the plot. Don't let Frank Oz or the lack of stars put you off. Everyone on screen has talent. Like the best comedies it has a simple premise. A son attempting to give his dearly departed father a dignified send off. Once family, old friends, old lovers, and a bottle of something that isn't Valum is thrown into the mix the hilarity and emotion kick into high gear.

Corpse gags? Check. Toilet humor? Absolutely, with visual aids. And of course it's not a British comedy without exposing some male buttocks. Mix in a dwarf (the writers seem to think), and zaniness should ensue. The problem is that all of this revolves around a minimal plot with poorly developed and unlikeable characters. The script contrives the silly situations too hastily, while several peripheral characters keep popping up, as if looking for a purpose in the movie. Because the conflicts and relationships are so superficial, you don't really care if or how it winds up. Although the movie attempts a sappy resolution within the span of about three minutes, many plot threads are left dangling at the end.One final note: in a telltale sign of a script which has little inherent humor, the creators of this movie try to punch up the zaniness with abundant profanity.

200,annielaural,audience sharing a set of assumptions,1,21 November 2007,"I cringed through the whole movie and couldn't wait for it to end - it was that severe. I detest that particular genre of English humour that relies on the audience sharing a set of assumptions about the proper and normal organisation of society and proper behaviour within that framework and then presumes comedy in the portrayal of the havoc caused when people behave incongruously. The inappropriate behaviour, the wreaking of havoc, comes from people of different class or nationality who fail to understand, adhere to or meet what the audience are assumed to understand to be the proper norms. In this film the wayward, middle class drug dealer who is the source of the illicit psychedelic drugs, the working class characters - the swearing Uncle Alfie and the uneducated, slightly stupid lad who is completely unaware of the deficiencies that make him an inappropriate match for the more educated girl from a wealthier family that he is pursuing  and, of course, the gay, midget American, are the sources of mayhem. 'Nice society', in the form of upper middle class English guests at a funeral, becomes the backdrop against which these characters, and all that they represent, are ridiculed. In a more sinister reading the audience is being alerted, however unconsciously, to the inherent dangers of admitting these representatives of the abnormal into decent society. What I really resent about this particular style of 'humour' is the failure to question, in fact the requirement that I, as a member of the audience, share, the view that these particular characters are the proper subject of ridicule. It is this requirement of allegiance to a particular set of class/race norms that, I think, is the major point of differentiation between this and other types of English 'mayhem comedy' such as Fawlty Towers. In Fawlty Towers the comedy lies in the riotous situations caused by actions, reactions and miscommunications between the neurotic Basil Fawlty, his sidekick, the silly Spanish waiter, Manuel, with his poor command of English, Basil's wife, the class-conscious Mrs Fawlty, and the other workers and permanent guests of the typical English seaside hotel in which it is set. While the exaggerated characters are clearly based on stereotypical characteristics linked mainly to class and cultural norms, all are equally ridiculous  the audience is not presumed to be in alliance with a particular set of norms against which particular characters are selected for ridicule.

206,kidcyrene,Was this film really necessary,4,31 May 2007,"I was invited to a pre-screening of this film last night and I have to say that I was decidedly underwhelmed. Frank Oz' take on the British Ensemble Comedy genre (so strange that this has become a ""genre"") is stale and uninspired.The film's nexus is the funeral of a family patriarch and though the funeral does play front and center in the plot, it's more important function is a means by which to bring an array of splintered family members and friends together to exhibit their interdependent quirkiness. I will not go through the entire list of characters and relationships (mainly because I don't really want to relive the moment), but to give you an idea of the type of retread plot that we are talking about here, one of the sub-plots revolves around Simon, played by Alan Tudyk (Dodgeball) and his accidental ingestion of a pharmacological hallucinogen created by his soon to be brother-in-law (Kris Marshall) who replaced the contents of a bottle marked ""valium"" with the mind altering chemical. I will at least applaud them for marking the bottle valium, rather than ""aspirin"", but this is such a tired plot device that a writer and/or director that wanted to use such a device would probably have to look up Mickey Rooney for advice on exactly how to properly execute the plot equivalent of a fart joke.The characters in this film are fleshed from stereotypical clichés and as a result the characters are enervated and stunted to a point that only a truly dynamic actor would be able to bring anything desirous and/or original to these roles. And though there are two passable performances, Alan Tudyk (Dodgeball) and the magnetic Peter Dinklage (The Station Agent) as a quasi-""widowed"" ex-lover, these performances were so excessively handicapped by a web of cliché'd farce and poorly conceived plot, that they were doomed to be lost. In fact, though I found the acting to be somewhere between mediocre and fair, it is difficult to cast any blame on the actors, as the film is really too weak to be saved by acting.Lastly, since I saw this film in pre-screen, the house was filled with Frank Oz lap dogs that were all too happy to laugh at the weak humor and such an overwhelming response from a doltish ""art house"" crowd surely contributes to a discourteous review... so in the event that this may have unfairly influenced my response to this film, let's say that there is a chance that the film is actually a 4.5 or 5 out of 10 stars.",Death at a Funeral
207,outs93043,"Our theater came with it's own canned laughter, otherwise, ZZZZZZZZZZZ",3,26 June 2007,"What do you do when you pre-screen a movie that has only about FIVE actually funny moments? You bring in ""PRE-SCREENING FACILITATORS."" We went to a free sneak preview of this tonight. Scattered around the middle section on seats were pieces of paper saying ""RESERVED FOR PRE-SCREENING FACILITATORS,"" and I guess it was their job to laugh at any possible moment. I almost got the feeling that some had seen it before because at times the laughed BEFORE the funny part (if it could have been considered funny.) They kinda ruined it for me because they were laughing long and loudly at only mildly funny scenes.After the movie, the ""facilitators"" stood all together discussing the movie as though it were Academy Award material. They looked pretty foolish to me. They were trying too hard.After reading the comments here about the film, I wonder, do ""facilitators"" write reviews also? I wish I could say it was an enjoyable movie, but all the needless crude elements ruined it for me, for example, man gets feces on his hand and face, man spits in the most disgusting way possible, and everyone uses the F-word in every possible way. No one, and I mean NO ONE uses that word nonchalantness and frequency as they do in this movie, and they certainly don't do it in the middle of a funeral. I appreciate the shock value of profanity, but this went over-the-top and then some. Profanity in a movie should be treated like salt on french fries -- too much of it ruins the experience. This would have been a decent (i.e., ENJOYABLE) movie without all the indecency. I guess it's o.k. if you're a freshman frat boy, but thinking adults should probably give it a pass. It's mostly obvious juvenile potty/drug/gross-out humor.This movie was pretty predictable.

214,rebelclause,Death at a Funeral -- Too Late Now,10,20 January 2008,"I'd rather not give away the ending of ""Death at a Funeral"" as there are so many darlings in the piece as to the inherent value of life and the meaning of it in many of the ways we deal with the surreal quality of our improvement of larger and larger networks and specialize in the pursuit of curatives ourselves. This film speaks to those people in the medical profession and to others who shape our communities and try to maintain local infrastructures.I must admit that medicine is a magic of memory from good training that I do not possess. I haven't got the eye other than for understanding where its use would be most appropriate to the station of an apparent healer and the impact of his mastery in the way he would present as a practitioner among practitioners and those in need of his services.To me, ""Death at a Funeral"" commanded a great deal of support against the separation of one member of a curative team from another, placing within the story a great context of burden on the writing profession to prove that its own output isn't coming from the same burden of sibling separation; an effect of gathering oneself into the story to make it rather than to post it to the audience of familiars to broadcast it as a pollen.In the ending, the curative effect seen is a random seed in both the world of the Author and of the Medical Practitioner that requires a history and pathology of the one who benefited to understand, but would, in the real world, be lost to the annals of panacea since in both the profession of Author and of Medical Practioner the Art, if accepted as shown, is not always the curative of the recipient, but often a mere diversion to her.In the same way that foreshadowing was used to occupy the box before it had actually happened, I hope the movie has some impact on deciding what the premise is before the actual curative is made for more than one person at a time.Copyright included.-- tim",Death at a Funeral
215,spudhimself,clearly I am in the minority...,1,21 March 2008,"Over the past few years I have come to rely upon IMDb as a relatively well-informed guide to the veritable mine-field of sh***y movies that are constantly spewing out onto celluloid, and have had what I believe to be reasonable success. Admittedly there have been a couple of instances that left me wondering how the short-bus crowd could get so interweb savvy and manage to give so many truly lame films such glowing reviews? Although no other such example has left me scratching my head in puzzlement at the complete absence of judgment displayed by the reviewers of this film.If this is what passes for funny, I am going to burn my library card and buy a gun.For the love of cod, people!!! Not one iota of this piece of crap was even remotely INTERESTING much less funny. I mean Benny Hill on his death bed could have farted onto film and it would have been more engaging... A first-grader raised entirely on franks 'n beans, Bratz and Hannah Montana ...* The only reasonable reaction to any of what goes on in this story is ""WHO EFFING CARES?!?!"" Let me be clear here: the only reason I fell compelled to so opine here isn't because this movie was *anything* - I mean there's nothing new to be said about movies of this sort - but because you all need to know how disappointed I am in all of you.If at any point in the future you watch a movie such as this and you say to yourself ""I really like this movie, it was funny and I think *_____* would like it too"" - kill yourself.

216,fargokurt,Mystery Midget,7,16 April 2008,"This movie really took off when the mystery midget attempted to blackmail the sons. It was rather low key humor prior to this. But once the mystery midget became involved in the story, the humor became more absurd slapstick; which I liked. So the first 1/4 of the film did a good job of setting up the absurd qualities later on. The movie was rather original. It must have been difficult for the actors to maintain the serious and somber tome of a funeral while having to do and say things that are rather absurd. I like the fact that the director and actors were able to pull off this contrast. I would recommend this for anyone in the mood for an absurd comedy. I give it a 6/10.",Death at a Funeral

""Death at a Funeral"" may all sound gloomy and depressing but what you have on the table is a complete laugh riot. Put a group of people at a point in their life where need is greater than the society in the grimmest of occasions and the end result of it is pure chaos and confusion.Watch the movie for the characters portrayed. The man in the coffin is the least of the worries and what transpires in the screen is how the simplest of their situations is made much more complex than how it should be.

Each character has such a genuine personality, you can relate many of them to people you actually know. All of them are such great actors. Peter Dinklage (short actor) is hilarious. He is so funny, a great actor. I love UK hummor and if you are into the English type of humor, you'll LOVE this one. I've seen it several times and laughed every time. I've talked to people of different ages who have seen this movie and they really enjoyed it. I highly recommend this movie. Most of the times when you see a funny movie there is one really funny character or a couple, this movie has so many characters that are funny. I think is a great movie to see with friends and really enjoy it. You'll definitely enjoy it more with company.You won't regret it!",Death at a Funeral
219,peteqwe,Death at a Funeral was an extraordinary movie (paraphrasing a key line in the movie),10,5 March 2009,"What a great movie. If you agree and haven't voted or submitted a review, please do so. We need to up the score. It should be above 95 rating!Why is it a great movie? Well, if you haven't seen it, DON'T READ FURTHER. It will spoil the movie!1. The opening scene sets the stage, for the humor that is to follow. 2. The movie has been described by reviewers as a typical British, stiff-upper lip attempt to deal will all sorts of adversity, but I think it would apply to any nationality. Imagine yourself in each of the characters shoes...wouldn't't you react the same way? Although certainly not as well as these professional actors/actresses did. 3. I love the structure of the movie. It all takes place in one amazing day. There are two physical objects that appear on and off throughout the movie: the casket and the pills. Many people get directly involved in these objects, so they tie the movie together..having two objects ties the movie even stronger than if there were just one object. 4. The timing of a few little scenes is perfect: Howard has just struggled to push up Uncle Alfie (what a perfect name!) to the front steps, when Justin (who has deserted Howard...didn't help him at all) steps in, pushes Uncle Alfie, and gets a thanks from Daniel. HA! Then there's the final scene dealing with how people wish that Robert would deliver the eulogy, when Daniel speaks to his wife, Jane. After he states to her that he deserves to give the eulogy, a couple walks by and says how unfortunate that Robert isn't giving the eulogy. 5. The expressions on their faces: Justin's unbelievably scrunched up forehead, Martha's concentrated ""baby-talk"" to Simon, explaining to him how he has to behave, Howard's grimace grin when walking to Daniel and Robert, to tell them the bad news. 6. The character-realistic responses, like Sandra's nasty comment about Jane smudging the casket, or Daniel's telling Jane that no, I haven't called about the flat, after he's getting overwhelmed and he knows what is on her mind. Haven't you met someone like Jane? Or told someone to stop bringing up something because you've got a bigger thing on your mind? 7. Simon. His opening line about how he never knew someone who could hate him so much, setting the stage for his nervousness. His incredible acting under the influence of the drug. His reaction to the 8 hour period of how long it will last. The ""Si"" (Martha), ""Mon"" (Simon) banter at the bathroom door. Just amazing acting. 8. The British slang...expressions/words that were new to me. 9. The drug helps keep the action going in the right direction, and preventing other logical things from taking place. Eg, Peter could shout out that he's being held prisoner, but he's too drugged. He could attempt to flee, but he ends up jumping up and down. It makes Simon imagine the casket moving, and latter allows him to say he was right the first time (although at this point, he's become saner). 10. ""My Father was an extraordinary man"" line gets repeated several times, initially demonstrating the nervousness of Daniel, later to begin what turned out to be an ad-hoc and much better eulogy. And this was a nice extra touch, that Daniel we see, as we had hoped, is a good speaker/writer. 11. Every actor and actress plays their part perfectly, rather emphatically. By that I don't mean loudly, but kind of stretching it to an extreme perfection fitting the specific situation. Daniel is quietish, Uncle Alfie is loud, Howard worried/harried, Justin is sleazy, all to a little extra degree, which simply makes you quite aware of what they are going through. 12. The concluding, everyone is gone, scene, with Daniel stretched out on the couch. After such a long day, it was nice to end the movie so relaxed and Robert showing a good side. But wait, it's not really over! One last bit of humor!Death at a Funeral was an extraordinary movie!",Death at a Funeral
220,Mymindsi_Studio,Only Brits know how to do this stuff! Brilliant!,9,18 July 2009,"This movie brilliantly exemplifies the wit, irony, sarcasm and dry sense of humor in great British black comedy. If you like movies like ""Keeping Mum"" and ""Shaun of the Dead"", you will love this offering. The movie is graced by a wonderful cast of well established comedic and dramatic actors. I loved it! If you are not familiar with the genre, but liked the American made ""Fargo"", you most likely will like this movie. It is lighter hearted than Fargo, but it contains the same type of irreverence. Subjects that are generally regarded as taboo, or in poor taste are perfectly parodied with that subtle humor that Brits do so well. A few scenes are farcical and ""in your face"", but the drier humor is most prevalent. Check it out.",Death at a Funeral
221,That_Movie_Bloke,I expected something better.,3,30 January 2010,"So, I finally got to see Death at a Funeral tonight and to be honest, I was disappointed. If you think a gay midget, tied up, gagged and force fed an overdose of illicit drugs is funny then get on board the ship to nowhere.I would find the situation above amusing normally, given the right script (well probably in any film but this), but it's just not funny. Don't get me wrong, I am no prude, so it's not the drugs or black humour that turns me off. I actually found it quite plain and did not laugh once. It might have been half amusing in parts but nothing to talk about.The only thought in my head for the entire film is how good Jane Asher looks for her age.This is my first review and it just happens I saw this movie tonight. I'm sorry it had to be the opposite of most other reviews I read but welcome to the truth.

It starts with a chuckle in the opening credits and slowly builds to spotty laughter, belly laughs, and loud groaning silliness. This is British farce with an expert ensemble cast. Everyone hits their marks and a couple go completely overboard and over-broad (Mr. Vaughn, we're looking at you.) Tudyk and Dinklage have the showiest parts and they feast on them. The rest of the cast is inspired and spot on.It's a delightful combination of highbrow meeting lowbrow and everything in between. A dash of wit and charm mixed in with a few genuine surprises.

Rest of the cast was also comedy gold playing off each other so well. This is what happens when Frank Oz gets to be Frank Oz.

The plot sounds good in the adverts and the cast are all good, but if I tell you that the story contains a homosexual midget getting trussed up and accidentally fed drugs, someone getting a pensioners excrement on their face.... I enjoy a good farce if there's some degree of intelligence in it. Very few of the laughs came from inspired characters or a sharp script - they were just cheap and predictable.The only plus point for me was Daisy Donovan who despite being known for comedy played it straight very well and may well have a genuine future in film if she wants it.The film Eulogy has a similar premise but is vastly superior.",Death at a Funeral

Then a mate of mine said he had heard good things about it. So that was it. A group of us would go out to dinner and then catch this flick. The only problem was the only theatre with the brains to show it was on the other side of town. But we had heard good things and bit the bullet. We almost did not make it due to our meals taking over an hour. But we made as the opening credits began. We had arrived totally flustered by the rush we had to do from the restaurant, but when we left we were still laughing as we discussed what had happened in the film. A few months later we were at the same restaurant and were discussing the last time we had eaten there and how we had seen Death at a Funeral and how we just had to see if it was out on DVD. Unfortunately when we got the the DVD rental store it still wasn't out. But the weekend it arrived we pounced on it like a cat on a mouse.

An that's what I saw. The movie is well written, well directed, although i would have liked to see longer shots like moving into a different scene without cutting.' The acting is good too. Some of the character are pretty forgettable but there are some that I will never forget. Like Peter Dinklage's character. I mean the dude was funny as sh*t. Rupert Graves is good in the movie, you know Lestrade from BBC's Sherlock. He kinda reminded me of Barney Stinson. There's another dude, played by Kris Marshall and he's like a drug dealer, dude was good. And Wash from Firefly he's in this movie, most of the movie he's on drugs, but he plays it good.To wrap up the movie funny and good. That is all I have to say",Death at a Funeral
229,dwsheetz,Death at a Funeral is a predictable yet very funny movie about a funeral gone way wrong.,8,5 May 2013,"""Death at a Funeral"" is a comedy about Daniel (played by Matthew MacFadyen) who is a man still living at home with his parents but getting ready to move in with his girlfriend Jane (Keeley Hawes) when his father dies. From the funeral home delivering the wrong body to eulogy, everything that can go wrong does. When Daniel's cousin Martha (played by Daisy Donovan) accidentally gives her boyfriend Simon (Alan Tudyk) a hallucinogenic cocktail that was in a bottle marked Valium, things start to go out of control. Later on Peter (Peter Dinklage) reveals to Daniel that he was having an affair with Daniels father and wanted 15,000 £ (about $23,346 US Dollars) to keep quiet or else he would show everyone at the funeral photos of an indecent nature. This movie reminded me of Four Weddings and a Funeral because of its British style humor. Although not the best comedy that I have seen, it kept me laughing throughout. It was very predictable in many areas but still remained funny. I did not know what to expect and thought that maybe it was a little too goofy based on the trailer. After watching it I felt all the actors played their parts well especially Peter Dinklage as the blackmailing dwarf, and Alan Tudyk as the very wasted boyfriend. Although most of the events were over the top, it seemed almost believable and struck my funny bone. Most people can relate to weird friends and relatives that show up to funerals and weddings and the drama they can bring to any event. There appears to be two themes, first is that anything that can go wrong will, and secondly that everyone may not always be how or what they appear to be. Simon who appears to be ruining the funeral because he is a strange person on drugs, did not take them intentionally. Because of the drugs he sees everything as very green, laughs at things he shouldn't, knocks over the casket and continues to do silly things throughout the movie. Meanwhile Peter the blackmailer gets told by Daniel that he won't get any money, so they tie him up and give him 5 of the pills marked Valium that were actually the same hallucinogens that Simon took by mistake. Peter gets very high from all the pills and while jumping around falls down and hits his head and lays there unconscious which causes everyone to think he is dead. Things get crazy and eventually the news of Peter's relationship with Daniels father gets revealed. In the end Daniel throws out his planned speech and gives a heartfelt eulogy that impresses even his professional writer of a brother, Howard (played by Andy Nyman). His speech reminds us that even though his dad was not perfect, and that things had gone terribly wrong in the funeral, he wanted everyone to take home the knowledge that his father was a good man who loved him and did the best he could.",Death at a Funeral

233,ryansisarich,Most hilarious film ever - I'd definitely recommend,10,13 October 2013,"After reading some of these reviews and noticing some aggressive responses to others comments I will add my opinion of the FILM and not partake in undermining others opinions. Likewise if you don't agree with my opinion I ask that you accept this to be MY opinion and to refrain from harrassing and slanderous comments - I will not answer as I do not engage in negativity :) SO... I would like to say that THIS version of ""Death at a funeral"" is the most hilarious film I have ever seen. I found the humour to be reminiscent of ""Blue Juice"" and at one point I had tears streaming down my face from laughter. The setting from London flats to the family country home is realistic (for middle class) and the acting is so naturally performed that the film and dialogue flows through rapidly without disturbances which highlights the rush of absolute chaos taking place. Writing Peter Dinklage's character into the script was a fantastic move, the character added insanity to the already insane situation that was developing. This would not have had such an effect if they used a 5'11"" man to play the part. Peter Vaughan was fantastic, my first bout of laughter was when he raised his cane at the oldies in their electric wheelchairs and it only got better from there. I did see the (American) remake and for me it was well below par. It seemed that the essence of the original had been lost in translation and as a result it did not stand out from the vast majority of other American comedies I have seen. I recently watched the original ""Death at a funeral"" a second time and I again really enjoyed the film. In all honesty I personally cannot find fault with this film, I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT so much so that when the credits started rolling I turned to my husband and told him ""that's exactly how I want my funeral to be"" :)",Death at a Funeral
234,glimmer246,"Smart, poignant laugh out loud humor.",9,12 June 2008,"Watch this film if you've had a bad day like I had when I happened upon this movie at the video store. It begins like the great old British mysteries where the characters are thrust upon you and you have to figure out the relationships between people. The difference here is that each character is instantly given a quirky personality during the hilarity that begins to ensue. Before we even get to the funeral-the main setting for the farce,we have already begun to form opinions of each character.One of the lovely things though about the movie is that the characters are filled out in such a short time despite the large cast that these early opinions mature in to pictures of more than one sided people. The annoying habit in many movies of making people either ""the dry responsible one"" or ""the devil may care guy"" etc. seems to have been avoided here in these well rounded characters. The cast is exceptional,the kind of actors that you see in a small role and say ""I don't know who that is but I really like them""--and they are all gathered here in one place. I happen to really like ensemble pieces and this is one of the few done the right way. The storyline is really secondary to the characters although it is the kind of plot that has been used before in not as good a style. These kind of stories can often lead to stupid humor and although there is bathroom humor-literally-and nudity,it is anything but stupid. Watch this film for some intelligent black humor,the well developed characters, the superb actors and the tears in your eyes-both from the bitter sweet eulogy and the hilarious laugh out loud funeral.",Death at a Funeral

Considering our current circumstances at the time you wouldn't think that a film about a funeral was something that we would want to watch. Andy Nyman's character Howard had us in stitches with his classic scenes pushing uncle Albert In his wheelchair and distracting the vicar when he said he wanted to push a pen up his bum.

I knew then that this movie was going to be one for me. Over the years, there have been some British comedy classics. From TV shows to movies, there has been some good ones. The new kid on the block of British comedy is sure to please anyone with a sadistic and gross out child heart. With a soon-to-be pharmacist making hallucinogens and inevitably making a few people ""trip out"", there is sure to be uproarious laughs echoing throughout the cinema. On the comedy side of things, the movie has been well looked after. A homosexual midget who claims to be the deceased fathers lover, a fiancé and soon-to-be father of the daughter of a doctor who already hates him, whacked out on hallucinogens, a grumpy old grandfather in a wheelchair who swears like a trooper and a son who just can't live up to his novel-writing brother. The movie is really well done and is a recommended movie to see. On the serious side, the main character, the son makes a heartfelt eulogy for his father at the end of the movie. After practicing his written speech, he ends up halting the chaos with a tear jerking speech (Well tear jerking if you are the family, not for the audience). If you would like to see a movie with a homosexual midget trying to blackmail a grieving family out of 15 thousand pounds with sexual photos, this movie is for you. If a movie is good enough for a whole cinema to burst out laughing and bring some people to their feet, it's definitely worth watching.If you love dark humor and gross out humor then you will love this movie.",Death at a Funeral
