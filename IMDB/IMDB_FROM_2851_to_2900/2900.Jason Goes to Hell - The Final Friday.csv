0,TheLittleSongbird,More like the 'Friday the 13th' series has gone to hell,3,9 January 2018,"'Friday the 13th' may have been panned by critics when first released but since then it is one of the most famous and influential horror films, the franchise containing one of horror's most iconic villains. The film is popular enough to become a franchise and spawn several sequels of varying quality and generally inferior to the one that started it all off. 'Jason Goes to Hell' for me is one of the worst of the 'Friday the 13th' films, a strong contender even for the worst. Is it irredeemably awful? No, not quite, don't think any of the 'Friday the 13th' films are. Then again this is coming from somebody who tries to see the good in bad films etc. and even tries to say where good to great films etc. could be improved on, not somebody who hates on everything or declare every film seen a classic. Sadly though, despite not caring hugely for the previous two instalments, 'Jason Goes to Hell' is indicative of the series has gone to hell. Are there good things here in 'Jason Goes to Hell'? Yes there are. The highlights are the tense opening scene and the slicing in half death (very strange but both disturbing and not easy to forget). Kane Hodder does a lot with little and is suitably creepily intimidating. There are instances too where the film is also inventively shot. On the other hand, while a good deal of 'Friday the 13th' films are silly, the silliness here is overkill that it becomes insultingly ridiculous. It is certainly the most bizarre film in the series, and not in a good way, and it completely gets in the way of scares or suspense. 'Jason Goes to Hell' overdoes just as much on the weirdness as it does with silliness. A lot fails to make sense, with too many parts confusing the story, and things that beg for an explanation are left unexplained, anything explanations are like the previous films didn't happen because so much doesn't fit.Hodder aside, the acting is really poor, even for the 'Friday the 13th' films where acting rarely was a strength. Likewise with the dialogue, which is 'Friday the 13th' at its most taking-simplicity-to-extremes, stilted, cheesiest and lacking in taste. Nothing is truly scary here, apart from the opening and one memorable death and suspense is nil. The kills are generally neither creative or shocking (going for more quantity, with a very large body count, than quality where gore feels too much and gratuitous. The pacing is far too hectic, the film never stops moving and everything here feels incredibly rushed, and this hurts the atmosphere and the storytelling. 'Jason Goes to Hell' is also the first film in the series where the music score is a drawback and not a redeeming feature, not only does the music sound cheap here it also is so discordant with what's going on and like it was written for a different film.Concluding, not a good film and indicative of a severe decline of a variable series of films. 3/10 Bethany Cox",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
1,Leofwine_draca,"A welcome, icky, ""final"" entry in the long-running series...",6,19 July 2016,"This supposedly ""final"" entry in the series (although yet another has been recently, unwelcomely made) wisely takes the theme in a different direction from the repetitive stalk-and-slash antics of the previous entries. Unfortunately for us, the film decides to takes its inspiration from that underrated classic THE HIDDEN, turning Jason into an evil being that swaps human bodies by sliding from mouth to mouth! Sadly the producers still see fit to throw in a few moronic teenagers, plenty of dumb characters, and stupid dialogue. But they also make one of the slimiest, ickiest entries in the entire series and in my book, that deserves points. Whether we're watching the human vessels that Jason travels in being shot to bits, impale,d and generally destroyed, or witnessing the truly disgusting ""body melt"" that occurs after he leaves the body of one of his hosts (ROBOCOP has nothing on this), the special effects are pretty damn good.Although the general acting of the cast leaves something to be desired, as a bonus point for cult fans we get the appearance of Erin Gray (Wilma Deering from BUCK ROGERS IN THE 25TH CENTURY) who shows up in a small but important role as a waitress who becomes one of Jason's victims. The male lead, who looks a lot like Ted Raimi, is actually quite good in his role, and the female lead isn't too bad either. However, the truly psychotic Steven Williams manages to steal every scene he's in as a sadistic bounty hunter following Jason's trail - just witness his totally unnecessary snapping of a man's fingers just for the hell of it. Of course fans of cult TV will no doubt recognise Williams as being the guy who played Mr. X in THE X-FILES, and the two characters are very similar: they shout a lot, throw their weight around and are generally fun to watch.So, for a Friday film, this offers us up a lot of action and violence, which is most welcome and makes things easier to take, a silly plot seemingly written on the back of a beer mat and designed to give Jason a motive (when they mentioned that Voorhees had a secret sister I groaned), and surprisingly good special effects. There are also a couple of in-jokes for movie buffs too, including the appearance of the Necronomicon from EVIL DEAD 2 and Freddy's gloved hand from A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. The crazy finale sees Jason being dragged into the ground by a load of giant hands which are supposed to represent the demons of hell - I was expecting more from this, especially with the build-up, the title and the fiery box art, and thus left disappointed. This isn't bad stuff though, just not particularly original. It could be worse - just try watching numbers 2, 4, 5 and 7 in this series instead. It would have made a good conclusion if they'd just decided to leave things alone after all, but when there are bucks to be made, you just know they're somehow going to contrive a reincarnation, no matter how absurd it might be...",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
2,SnoopyStyle,Keep it simple please!,3,18 October 2013,"Jason is tricked by an FBI sting where they blew him to bits. Only his dark heart still beats. When the coroner falls under the trance of the beating heart, he eats it up and becomes possessed by the great evil.Steven Williams is too campy as bounty hunter Creighton Duke. And he's not the funny kind of campy. An older Erin Gray stars as Diana Kimble. At least I like her.The problem with this one is it takes a lot of side trips away from the simple Jason-killing-teens story. It's what the franchise is about. It's what we expect. The FBI thing just comes and goes. I understand that it's meant to surprise us. But after the surprise, there isn't much follow thru. The possession premise of this movie strays too far from the franchise, and just misses the whole point of it all. It's as if they're trying to throw everything at this including the kitchen sink.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
3,kosmasp,Final(ly)?,8,11 November 2020,"We had Jason movies before that challenged the fans. But none so much like this does. Right from the start you get the cliches all thrown in your face. Girl, alone, cabin, night - I mean if you thought it couldn't get more cliche ... well the movie proves that wrong. But than it flips! I'm not even sure if one can call it flipping! This is insane! You might not believe what happens - which the title sort of suggest, but in the first 10 minutes or however long it took? Of course that is not it and family relationships aside (which I think you can critisize), more people have an issue with the on screen time Kane Hodder gets in the movie - btw he returns to the character/role and plays him for the third time! That's quite something. but Kane also gets another on screen role (and his hand gets a ""third part"" if you want to call it that towards the end).So this takes a lot of liberties, which obviously makes people rather hate it. But this otherness or whatever you want to call it, makes it so unique and really fun to watch! Since in general I am more of a Freddy Kruger kind of guy (if you would pit them against each other, which wait for it, did happen), I am biased to a degree. But I do love this has more story and some quite memorable scenes. One being in Jail, quite gruesome and mental to say the least. And one of the best killings slash offings of the series that has a moral subtext (although I reckon unsafe sex might not be that subtle a thing to be punished for).I personally enjoyed this a lot, flaws and all included (who cares about a spelling error? Seriously, take it as a joke). Sit back and enjoy this very crazy ride, with some of the best performances of the series",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
4,gavin6942,Easily My Favorite in the Series,7,15 November 2010,"Jason Voorhees is destroyed by the FBI, but it turns out that Jason is not really a person, but a creature and he can go from body to body with ease... killing him will not be the walk through the park they expected.This is probably the most controversial film in the series: you either love it (like me), or you hate it for its crazy departure from the earlier movies. The commentary features director Adam Marcus and writer Dean Lorey joking about the bad reception many gave it and the film's poor continuity.They explain that the goal was ""every 7 minutes a fresh pair of breasts and every seven minutes a violent death"", which they failed at miserably. Producer Sean Cunningham also wanted them to get rid of the hockey mask, as that was an invention of Steve Miner. They succeeded.The original script was about the twin brother Elias Voorhees, but thankfully that was dropped because it's even less sensical than what came about. The MPAA predictably cracked down on this film because the ""cumulative effect"" is ""too intense"", though it says something about American censorship because no other country showed the film cut. Also, ""pickle"" can get you R, but ""angry pickle"" is NC-17.The Book of the Dead appeared because Sam Raimi was shooting ""Army of Darkness"" at the time, no other reason. How the crate from ""Creepshow"" and the jungle gym from ""The Birds"" got in there is another story...Love it or hate it, this was the most gory Jason film up to this point -- blood and gore galore, with one of the best kills in the entire series, if not the best hands-down. You will know exactly which one I mean if you've seen this.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
5,lee_eisenberg,my friends and I had to watch the tent scene a few times,5,9 July 2010,"Seriously, THE reason to watch ""Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday"" is the tent scene (or whatever it's called). When my friends and I watched the movie, we had to watch that scene a few times just to absorb it. It has to be one of the coolest scenes ever put to film.The rest of the movie is pretty routine, as the hockey-masked slasher goes around butchering people. Needless to say, it wasn't the final Friday, since there was another addition to the series, plus ""Freddy vs. Jason"".So, it's fun just to watch and laugh as various and sundry characters get slaughtered for disobeying the survival rules laid out in ""Scream"". Knowing that Jason and Freddy met, I wonder if the two will ever meet Michael Myers.That jungle gym was the one from ""The Birds"". Now there's something that Hitchcock never predicted!",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
6,jboothmillard,Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday,4,27 May 2016,"The previous eight Friday the 13th films all came one after the other in the 1980s, with mixed results, this ninth entry was billed as being the final film in the series, but you can't keep a good psycho killer down. Basically sometime after the events in Manhattan, the undead serial killer Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) is back at Camp Crystal Lake, he is lured into a trap by undercover FBI Agent Elizabeth Marcus (Julie Michaels), several armed men blow him to pieces, his body is destroyed and his remains taken to the Federal Morgue in Youngstown, Ohio for autopsy. Jason's putrid heart remains intact, the Coroner (Bean's Richard Gant) is fascinated by the remains, then Jason's heart starts beating, igniting a transfer of Jason's surviving soul, the coroner is possessed by Jason's demonic spirit after ingesting his heart, in the coroner's body Jason (who only shows in a mirror reflection) escapes, killing all in his path. Jason returns to Crystal Lake, where he finds and kills partying teens having sex, he also attacks two police officers, killing one and possessing the other, it is revealed later that Jason must continue transporting into other bodies, as he has a limited time to use each. Meanwhile bounty hunter Creighton Duke (Steven Williams) discovers that Jason can only be killed permanently by a member of his bloodline, and that he will return to his normal and near-invincible state if he possesses the body of a family member, his only living relatives are his half-sister Diana Kimble (Erin Gray), her daughter Jessica (Kari Keegan), and Stephanie, the infant daughter of Jessica, and Jessica's infant daughter Stephanie (Brooke Scher), Steven Freeman (John D. LeMay) is the father. Jason makes his way to Diana's house, she is killed, but he escapes when attacked by Steven, who is falsely arrested for murder, he meets Duke who explains Jessica's relation to Jason, Steven escapes from jail determined to get to her before Jason does. Jessica is dating American Case files reporter Robert Campbell (Steven Culp), he wants to boost ratings for his show, emphasising the return of Jason Voorhees from the dead, having stolen Diana's body from the morgue, Robert is next to have Jason's heart transferred. Jason attempts to reborn through Jessica, but is disrupted by Steven who takes her and hits him with his car, Steven tries to explain the situation to Jessica, but she doesn't believe him, throwing him out of the car and heading to the police station. Jason arrives at the police station, killing most of the officers, he nearly possesses Jessica before being stopped by Steven, she now believes him, in the chaos Duke makes his escape, Jessica and Steven go to a cafe to collect the baby, Jason is attacked by the owners before he kills them, Jessica and Steven find a note from Duke, he has the baby and demands Jessica meet him alone at the Voorhees house. At the house Duke gives Jessica a mystical dagger that she can permanently kill Jason with, meanwhile Jason transfers from Robert's body into a police officer. Duke falls through the floor, Sheriff Ed Landis (Billy Green Bush) and Officer Randy Parker (Kipp Marcus) confront Jessica, she accidentally kills Landis dropping the dagger, Randy is possessed by Jason, who attempts to reborn through Stephanie, but Steven arrives and severs his neck with a machete. Jason's heart, which has grown into a demonic infant, crawls out of Randy's neck, goes to the basement, and crawls into Diana's dead body, Duke is pulled out of the basement by Jessica and Steven as Jason is reborn into his original body (he does not need an actual living member of his family). Steven and Jessica try to retrieve the dagger, while Duke distracts Jason, he is killed, the dagger is found and Jason is stabbed in the chest, the souls Jason collected over time are released, and Jason is pulled into the depths of Hell by demonic hands, Steven and Jessica walk off with their baby into the sunset. Also starring Kane Hodder as a Security Guard, and a cameo by Freddy Krueger's arm (the ambiguous ending that lead to Freddy vs. Jason, ten years later), Rusty Schwimmer as Joey B., Leslie Jordan as Shelby, Andrew Bloch as Josh, Adam Cranner as Ward, Allison Smith as Vicki and James Gleason as Agent Abernathy. Unlike the previous films this entry does continue directly after the previous film, so Jason is essentially back from the dead with no explanation, and the same thing happened when he returned eight years later in tenth entry Jason X, critics praise the clever body- swapping concept to keep the crazed killer alive, I personally found it a bit out of place for the series, the gore was fairly good though, in my opinion it's an alright horror. Okay!",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
7,Woodyanders,You can't keep a good killer down,8,2 February 2009,"Seemingly unstoppable and indestructible killer Jason Voorhees (hulking behemoth Kane Hodder in peak menacing form) finally gets blown to bits by the feds in an ambush, but he ain't down for the count just yet. Jason this time takes over the bodies of other folks so he can continue butchering people. Moreover, he can either be reborn or destroyed by a blood relative. Director Adam Marcus, working from a clever script by Dean Lorey and Jay Huguely, relates the compelling story at a constant snappy pace, maintains a mean, brutal tone throughout, delivers plenty of nasty gore (a young lady getting impaled on a tent spike while doing just what you think with her boyfriend rates as the definite splatter highlight), further tarts things up with a welcome sense of self-mocking black humor, offers a generous sprinkling of tasty female nudity, stages the murder set pieces with rip-roaring brio (the delightfully outrageous diner massacre sequence in particular seriously smokes), and really goes for broke with a gloriously wild ending which comes complete with one doozy of a sequel set-up punchline. The solid cast contribute admirably sincere performances: John D. LeMay makes for a refreshingly unlikely hero as the nerdy Steven Freeman, Kari Keegan likewise impresses as the sweet Jessica Kimble, Steven Williams almost steals the whole show with his colorful portrayal of flamboyant bounty hunter Creighton Duke, plus there are neat turns by Erin Gray as the spunky Diana Kimble, Allison Smith as Jessica's cheery gal pal Vicki, Steven Culp as opportunistic TV newscaster Robert Campbell, Billy Green Bush as the hard-nosed Sheriff Ed Landis, and Rusty Schwimmer as feisty, foul-mouthed diner owner Joey B. William Dill's slick cinematography gives the picture a properly moody look. Harry Manfredini's amped-up version of his familiar shivery score hits the shuddery spot. The make-up effects by KNB are first-rate. Unjustly ridiculed by most fans of the series, this outing sizes up as one of the more creative and entertaining entries in the long-running slasher horror series.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
8,Tweekums,The 'Jason Voorhees' mythology is rewritten... and becomes pretty stupid,4,20 January 2019,"This instalment opens in typical 'Friday the 13th' fashion; an attractive woman in a remote house strips off for a shower before the power goes out. Donning a towel she goes to investigate and is faced by Jason Voorhees and flees... however she is no damsel in distress, she is an FBI agent luring him into a trap where he is riddled with bullets and then blown to pieces.This is not the end of him of course; he is taken to a government facility where a coroner has the sudden urge to eat Jason's heart. It appears he is now possessed by Jason and heads home to Crystal Lake. Only one person, Creighton Duke, knows how to kill him; and even then the person who does the deed must be a Voorhees... luckily Jason has a sister and a niece but this puts them at the top of the list of people to kill and as it appears he can now change bodies they won't know who they can trust. Of course before he gets to them he will kill plenty of other people.When this started I thought it didn't look as cheap as the other films and hoped it might actually be an improvement on the disappointing eighth instalment... I was wrong. It got silly straight away. One can forgive the silliness of the showering FBI agent as misdirection but Jason's 'death', with his still beating heart shown afterwards was a warning of what was to come. The story that followed completely abandoned the previous mythology; instead of a half forgotten nightmare talked about around the campfire Jason is now the most famous killer in America and rather than coming back from the dead when his body is electrified we get a new mythology where something in him can travel from body to body before he can be truly reborn via a Voorhees woman. That isn't even the worst of it there is also a magical dagger needed to kill him! The sad thing is it could easily have been a solid addition to the series if it weren't for the unnecessary changes. There were plenty of murders that weren't out of place in the series and gore-fans might be pleased that they were messier than those in some of the more recent films. Overall I'd say this one is for the completist only; it takes more than gore and gratuitous nudity to make a good 'Friday the 13th' film.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
9,BA_Harrison,Dreadful!,3,21 June 2006,"Part 9 of the Friday 13th series starts promisinglya seemingly helpless beauty is chased through the woods by Jason Vorhees (wielding his trademark machete), only for it to be revealed that he is being led is into a trap set by the militarybut the film soon develops into a reprehensible mess.After a rocket attack blows him to smithereens, Jason's remains are taken to a military base, where an autopsy is to take place. For some inexplicable reason, the doctor performing the procedure eats Jason's heart, becomes possessed by his spirit and sets off to kill the only people in the world able to destroy Mr. Vorhees foreverhis relatives (didn't know he had living kinfolk, did you?).Jason Goes to Hell takes the legend of the killer of Camp Crystal Lake and dumps all over it from a great height. The story is utter nonsense, the acting is dreadful, and, with the exceptions of a cool death scene in a tent and a juicy body melt, the gore is rather dull. The rather obvious references to other horror movies that litter the filmprobably meant as clever 'in-jokes' for horror buffsannoyed the hell out of me, and a truly awful finale (featuring a cameo from A Nightmare on Elm Street's Freddy Krueger) ended what is one of the worst Friday the 13th movies ever.In this chapter of the Friday the 13th series, Jason Goes to Hell. And as far as I am concerned, the makers of this drivel can go there as well.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
10,paul_haakonsen,Interesting change of events...,6,16 December 2015,"The ninth installment to the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise takes everything from previous movies and go one step beyond. There has been supernatural stuff in previous movies for sure, but it is taken one step further in part nine. Personally I didn't care much for the body-jumping thing, but it was at least shown with some deterioration of the host body, and the fans are given some long awaited detail into the Voorhees family.Jason is tracking the last of the Voorhees lineage, and death follows wherever he goes. However, Hell is awaiting to welcome home a long lost tenant.Story-wise, then part nine follows the franchise well enough, just adding a more supernatural element than ever before. A good or bad idea? That is a matter of personal preference.Kane Hodder is back as Jason, and does it like only he can! Alongside Hodder was other talented actors and actresses such as Steven Williams, Steven Culp, Erin Gray and Leslie Jordan.Continuing the decomposition of Jason starting from part 6, then Jason is looking rather interesting in part nine, with tufts of hair and the hockey mask looking to be embedded into the flesh of his rotting head. It is a really nice touch, and I do like the changes of his physique.Part nine was also the movie that stirred the horror scene with a possible Jason and Freddy crossover movie, given the ending of ""Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday"".",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
11,BandSAboutMovies,"Still ripping off Halloween, all these years later",4,13 April 2018,"At Camp Crystal Lake, an undercover government agent lures Jason into a trap, blowing him up real good. I saw this scene in a movie theater in Youngstown, OH (former murder capitol of the US!) and the crowd cheered their name being mentioned as a place Jason had been seen.Soon after, the body is being examined by a coroner who is moved to eat the heart and ingest the spirit of Jason. He goes right back to Crystal Lake and right back to killing him. And now comes the part of the story that no one has ever figured out until now, making the story just like Halloween (again!): Creighton Duke (Steven Williams, Dr. Detroit) is a bounty hunter who learns that only members of Jason's bloodline can truly kill him. Even worse, if he can possess a member of his family, he'll become invincible.The only living relatives of Jason are his half-sister Diana Kimble (Erin Gray!), her daughter Jessica, and Stephanie, the infant daughter of Jessica and Steven Freeman (John D. LeMay, who played Ryan Dallion on the otherwise unrelated Friday the 13th: The Series).Jessica is now dating tabloid TV reporter Robert Campbell (Steven Culp, Rex Van de Kamp from Desperate Housewives), yet it is Steven that saves her from Jason. He gets blamed for her mother's death and just Robert is about to take advantage, Jason goes into his body, all with the goal of impregnating his half-sister and making a perfect Jason baby. Oh incest, we were waiting for you to show up.Meanwhile, Jason wipes out most of the police in town. But then Duke the bounty hunter steals the baby and demands that Jessica meet him at the Vorhees house alone, so that he can give her the mystical dagger that can kill Jason. Now this film has become The Omen.Despite all this, the heart that is Jason grows into a demonic infant and then crawls into a dead woman's vagina and is reborn. Yes, you just read that sentence correctly. And man, I said that 5 was the scummiest entry in the series!It all works out - the dagger releases all of the souls that Jason has accumulated and demonic forces drag him into hell. At the end of the movie, a dog finds Jason's mask and of all things, Freddy's gloved hand pulls it into the ground!",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
12,Coventry,Is this really the worst film in the Friday-series ???,7,31 August 2003,"SPOILERS !!!SPOILERS !!!SPOILERS !!!SPOILERS !!!SPOILERS !!!SPOILERS !!!I don't share this opinion, but I can see why many fans of the series say that this ninth film is the worst in the series. The Jason Vorhees saga started in the early 80's. Spread over 8 films, Jason ( and his mother) have killed almost 100 people in very horrible ways. Jason goes to hell starts with a complete new theory...which is pretty dumb, I'll give it that. But still, there's as much blood and terror represented in this film as there is in all the other ( to say the least, in fact ) According to a bountyhunter ( who is a pretty good maniac himself ), Jason can be killed for good if a relative of his destroys his heart. If they don't, Jason comes to life again and shall go on killing till eternity. Until Jason finds a family member of his, he keeps on changing bodies. This twist given to his personality kills the magic that is Friday the 13th a bit, that much is true. I never was a giant fan of the series. I've seen them all and liked them but I never agreed with the statement that Friday the 13th is THE best series in horror. Now, I do know a lot of people who think that Jason is as important to horror as Christopher Columbus was to geography, so they think this ninth installment in the series never should have been made. If you're a horror lover in general, you can still enjoy the huge amount of bloody slaughters without paying much attention to the storyline. If you're a die-hard Jason Vorhees fan ( or want to become one) ...watch the whole series in a row and judge for yourself if this movie can be considered as blasphemy or not. One other thing is very obvious about this movie : it tries to be more funny than its predecessors and makes several attempt to spoof the genre and the most famous slasher colleagues of Jason. For example, when a cop asks where Steven is, the girls answers ""He's in front of the MYERS' house!"" Funny, huh ? Also, the Necronomicon lies in Jason's basement and when he finally dies, his hockey-mask is grabbed away by the hand of Freddy Krueger himself. So, if you like a good amount of trivia to come with your horror...The Final Friday won't let you down!",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
13,preppy-3,Easily the goriest of the series,7,25 August 2006,"This film ignores the past six films or so--it basically starts where part 3 ended. A woman is alone near Camp Crystal Lake. After her obligatory nude scene she is being chased by Jason. It turns out to be an ambush and Jason is blown away (literally). His various body parts are taken to a coroner. It seems his heart is still beating and it possesses the coroner (!!!) and he EATS it (easily one of the more disturbing scenes). Then Jason's spirit is alive in him and out killing people. He's out to kill his sister Dinah (who has never been mentioned before) and her daughter. It seems only a Voohees can kill a Voorhees completely (????). And he can jump from body to body...Totally crazy sequel but, in a strange way, lots of fun. The body count is enormous (19 guys, 6 women), there's gratuitous female AND male nudity, the gore is strong (I'm surprised this got an R rating) and the movie moves so fast you don't have time to stop and think about how really stupid it is.My favorite sequence has to involve the three horny teenagers that camp out by Crystal Lake. (By the way, their bit has nothing to do with anything in the rest of the picture) It involves plenty of nude scenes and has the goriest killing ever seen in a major motion picture.The acting is actually pretty good (except for the guy who played Crighton Duke) and there are references to other horror movies like ""The Evil Dead"", ""Creepshow"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street"". For my money this is the best of the sequels (aside from ""Jason vs. Freddy""). I've heard the director's cut is even gorier! A must see for gore fans. I give it a 7.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
14,poolandrews,Easily the worst Friday the 13th sequel.,6,10 January 2005,"We begin as Elizabeth Marcus (Julie Micheals) drives along a country road towards Camp Crytal Lake. She arrives at a large house and once settled in she runs herself a bath. Suddenly everyone's favourite indestructible mass murderer Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) attacks her. It turns out that Elizabeth is an FBI agent and has lured Jason into a trap. Once in position Jason is shot and blown to pieces, but even in spite of this his heart still beats. Next we're off to the 'Federal Morgue, Youngstown, Ohio'. A pathologist named Phil (Richard Gant) starts the autopsy. While examining Jason's heart it begins to beat and for some reason that I can't really understand Phil starts to eat it. Phil is now possessed by Jason and kills his assistant (a cameo by co-writer Dean Lorey), he leaves the morgue and heads back to Camp Crystal Lake. The story is heavily covered by the media. A T.V. programme called 'American Casefile' hosted by Robert Campbell (Steven Culp) interviews a bounty hunter named Creighton Duke (Steven Williams) who has tracked and captured many serial killers. Duke says for $500,000 he will kill Jason Voorhees. At Crystal Lake Duke contacts waitress Diana Kimble (Erin Gray) who happens to be Jason Voorhees sister. Duke asks for her help but the local Sheriff, Ed Landis (Billy Green Bush) and his Deputy, Josh (Andrew Bloch) arrest him, I not sure for what though. Having heard that Jason is possibly still at large through the T.V., Diana tells Steven Freeman (John D.LeMay) who is seeing her daughter Jessica (Kari Keegan), to meet her that night as she has something to tell him about Jessica and her baby girl Stephanie. After the films best kill sequence in which Phil who is still possessed by Jason murders three young campers Alexis (Kathryn Atwood), Debbie (Michelle Clunie) and her boyfriend Luke (Micheal B.Silver), he kidnaps a policeman named Josh (Andrew Bloch) and possesses him. Josh/Jason then heads to Diana's house and kills her just as Steven shows up. They fight and Josh/Jason is wounded and leaves as Sheriff Landis turns up and arrests Steven for the possible murder of Diana. While in prison Steven meets Duke in the next cell who tells him about Jason and that he is going to go after his only blood relatives as they are the only one's who can kill Jason for good. Duke says Jason's only blood relatives left were Diana who is now dead, her daughter Jessica and her baby Stephanie. Jason continues to jump from body to body as he searches for Jessica and Stephanie while Steven must somehow get out of jail and both warn Jessica and try to stop Jason, for good. But will he succeed or will Jason triumph and become totally invincible? Directed by Adam Marcus I think this is easily the worst Friday the 13th film. The script by Dean Lorey and Jay Huguely ignores the simple yet trusted formula that made the previous films what they are. Jason himself is only in it for about 10 or so minutes, 5 minutes at the start and 5 at the end. Did the filmmakers not realise that one of the series strong points was Jason in his trade-mark hockey mask? The film doesn't feel like a Friday the 13th, it has a melting man, Jason possessing people and a little monster that runs around at the end for instance. There is a scene in jail when Duke talks to Steven who is convinced within 5 minutes that Duke is right about Jason being an indestructible undead murderer who can only be killed by two people on Earth, I sat there thinking that if I was Steven I would at the very least want some proof. Steven had never even met Duke before this point, oh and Steven lets Duke dislocate his fingers as payment for his information, yeah right. The in-jokes like the 'book of the dead' from the Evil Dead (1981, 1987, 1993) films, the crate from one of the segments from Creepshow (1982) and the Freddy Krueger hand grabbing Jason's mask at the end are both lame and seem very out-of-place. Apart from the sequence when the female camper is impaled and split in half there isn't much gore to shout about, either. People coughing up blood is about it, unless you count a scene where Josh melts after Jason leaves his body. Just one scene with nudity as well. The films well made overall but it doesn't really mean much in such a disappointing film. On it's own, without the Friday the 13th connection which is loose anyway it's not a bad film. But considering this is meant to be a Friday the 13th film I found the fact that Jason wasn't killing teenagers in his hockey mask an insurmountable problem. Average at best, extremely disappointing at worst. Watch one of the other 9 instead, Jason goes to Hell is the 'black sheep' of the family.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

JASON (2003) a couple of years back, I had no idea (apart from what I gathered from the various discussions in the ""Halloween Challenge"" thread) that the last 3 entries in the Jason Voorhees saga (so far) were made by other hands as it were (New Line rather than Paramount) and therefore not officially considered part of the series. Having now acquainted myself with them, I can see why... If the character of Jason Voorhees was peripheral to the plot of Friday THE 13TH PART V: A NEW BEGINNING (1985), he is even more so here: I don't know if this was a conscious decision on the film-makers' part to make this a completely new kind of ""monster"" but the result is that one gets the feeling that he is watching a wannabe David Cronenberg movie rather than a Jason movie, what with all that soul transference going on every couple of minutes via that disgusting tongue thing (which looks more like a turd being passed on from one...ah, nevermind)! And what's up with that ALIEN-style creature which makes an appearance at the climax?! Some of the characters - like the really mean bounty hunter - work well for the movie but some of the locals - like the fat bartender (who does get a hilarious come-uppance at least) and her entourage - are just there merely to increase the film's body count; the most notable piece of gore here is Jason's slitting of a horny female teenager just as she is getting it on with her man in their tent! For what it's worth, the climactic title sequence is quite atmospheric and that twist in the very last shot was an amusing touch (although it does make you wonder why the eventual ""duel"" took so long in coming)!",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

This is pure dreck that tosses out most of what made the previous films fun and adds an unnecessary amount of plot. This should come as little surprise since this was the first Jason movie made at New Line, home of the Nightmare on Elm Street series. The opening to this one will let you know right off the bat that you're in for a truly awful viewing experience: a woman shows up at Camp Crystal Lake and baits Jason into a trap where FBI agents attack him. Sub-moronic on every level but the movie just gets worse from there with Jason having body possessing powers, a 'Jason hunter' played by master ham Steven Williams, a magic dagger, and a revelation about Jason's mother that, if accepted, cheapens the original film. It's really just a shitty movie, folks. If you're looking for a fun time-passing slasher, you're out of luck. This is ugly, stupid, and dull.

It's unlike any of the other previous Friday the 13th movie entries, meaning that it's being different and original but not all of the changes in the formula are for the good of this movie.For instance it was a bad idea to let Jason's spirit sort of live on in whoever he possesses. This means that the character is being portrayed by numerous different persons this time and the movie doesn't have much of the iconic and recognizable Jason Voorhees character in it. Kane Hodder had always been a awesome Jason in the most recent entries before this movie, so it seems like a real waste to not use him more.It has more story than the usual random Friday the 13th movie entry but the story isn't always much good though. It's just being a bit ridicules at times. It's also just being far from the ultimate Friday the 13th movie that you are hoping for, knowing that this is the movie in which Jason will finally die and go to hell were he belongs.What was good was that the movie was finally trying to uncover Jason's past and 'what' exactly he was. The previous movies simply never bothered with this and were all about Jason randomly killing a bunch of teenagers. Not that the movie is being fully satisfactory with this all though, as if most stuff revealing things about how he got to be the evil murderous characters were cut out of the movie later. There are some small hints at times but it just never gets fully explored.The movie also used some great looking effects, to enhance the movie its gore. It's really one of the more gory Friday the 13th movies out there, that features plenty of bloody killing and other gory looking moments.It's a really different Friday the 13th movie, that makes some good changes but also makes some horrible choices along the road, making this a real mixed movie.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
19,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"""Final"" keeps meaning ""expect more"" in this series",6,24 January 2011,"Jason, having teleported back from Manhattan inbetween movies, is blown apart, by the FBI, at the very beginning of this, and he does not appear(as portrayed by Hodder, at least) much beyond that in this. Instead, his demonic spirit begins to take over other bodies, seeking to find a lasting one to replace the one now in pieces, in a sort of Child's Play kind of idea. This is different from every other entry, and how open you are to that will help to determine how much you like it. They poke fun at the slasher sub-genre some, and there are funny moments in this. Some of the characters(there aren't many obnoxious ones in this one, probably why we care when things happen, especially in the last half) are quite likable, including our male lead, and the resident cool black dude of the film, the bounty hunter Creighton Duke(who looks like he's right out of the Wild West), who they use just little enough that he remains really effective. There is no real stalking in this, we again get swift, brutal attacks but they are exciting and, in spite of the killer now being ""regular people"", or perhaps specifically because of it, we are terrified of him. The deaths are creative and memorable, and the FX(save for the 2D animated light stuff) are *great*. This has more plot and mythology(that only the first two really had) than any of the others, in fact, it's probably in excess of the rest when they're all put together. I don't like for mysteries in horror to be explained away, but if they were gonna(...and they were, this is the ninth one), this is a pretty cool take on it. This is 84 minutes long sans credits. It's filmed and edited quite well, as Adam Marcus proves that sometimes, fans can do really well when given the reins of the object of their affection. There is a lot of blood, gore and violence and a little nudity and sexuality in this. The DVD comes with the original theatrical trailer and a decent article entitled Slash and Burn(it is of course on the ""pro"" side). I recommend this to any fan of the franchise who would like this approach. 6/10",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
20,view_and_review,"""In a Voorhees was he born....""",5,22 April 2020,"You gotta admire Jason's tenacity, his perseverance, his commitment. Sure, he may have a socially unacceptable hobby, but just look at how he goes about it. He has a never-quit, never-die attitude. Nine movies in and he's still racking up bodies (I counted 18 this movie which is about average for him).The ""Friday the 13th"" writers dispensed with any inference that Jason may be human this time around. Truthfully, we could say they did that back in part 5 when they brought him back from the dead via lightning, but they put it totally to rest in this episode. Bounty hunter, Duke Creighton (Steven Williams), flat out said that the body of Jason is not the real Jason, it's just flesh. It's his essence that can continue to live on even in another body. How Duke knew this is beyond me, but that's exactly what Jason did---jumped from body to body much like a parasite going from host to host.""Jason Goes to Hell"" started off with the best Jason trap imaginable. If you remember, in part eight Jason was in New York. So, the NYPD (presumably) set this awesome trap and unloaded on Jason with hundreds of rounds of ammo and a grenade. They blew him to bits. They did precisely what any intelligent and right-minded city and community would do: threw so much fire power at him that there would be no Jason left. Except... they didn't count on Jason's detached and disembodied heart to continue beating.Apparently, this pulsating heart had hypnotic powers. While Jason's body was under the stewardship of the federal coroner (Richard Gant) he ATE THE HEART thereby allowing Jason's essence to enter him and allow him to continue the superfluous killing Jason was accustomed to.According to bounty hunter extraordinaire, Creighton Duke---the most learned man on all things Jason Voorhees: ""In a Voorhees was he born. Through a Voorhees may he be reborn. And only by the hands of a Voorhees may he die.""Confused?Jason had a sister, niece, and grand-niece. Yeah, his crazy mama had another child. If Jason could just get to one of them, he'd be able to be reborn in his old body instead of occupying the frail bodies he was restricted to.If the new storyline about Jason wasn't weird enough, when one of the bodies he was inhabiting got beheaded, an alien like creature crawled from it in search of a new host. Jason's essence had effectively become a xenomorph from the movie ""Alien."" It crawled into his dead sister and from that he was reborn to normal Jason (i.e. Kane Hodder). This rebirth didn't last long because his niece, Jessica Kimble (Kari Keegan), stabbed him in the heart with the magic knife she got from Duke.Got all that? I don't think this episode was any worse than the last five. It's been the pits every since Cory Haim (or Cory Feldman) hacked him up. This was even more fantasy than the others, but Jason has long since been a supernatural being.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
21,Uriah43,Definitly One of the Last Installments to the Franchise,6,23 October 2019,"This film essentially begins with a young woman by the name of ""Elizabeth Marcus"" (Julie Michaels) attempting to take a bath in a cottage at Camp Crystal Lake and being attacked by ""Jason Voorhees"" (Kane Hodder). Fortunately, she manages to escape and runs out of the house and into the woods with Jason in hot pursuit. Suddenly, lights appear as Jason discovers that the woman has lured him into a trap by FBI agents who fire their guns at him with deadly accuracy which results in his body being ripped to shreds. Not long after that, his body is taken to a morgue in Columbus, Ohio where a coroner is tasked to perform an autopsy. While doing so, however, Jason's evil spirit manages to possess the coroner's body and from that point on Jason resumes his murderous rampage once again. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film incorporated more of a supernatural theme than its predecessors and it worked to a certain degree. Admittedly, it could have used a bit more suspense and better character development but it managed to keep my attention for the most part and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
22,kannibalcorpsegrinder,One of the best entries in the series,10,30 October 2015,"Presumed dead after an FBI raid, the locals' attempt to move on is affected by Jason Voorhees' return by body-hopping through the various people in town trying to kill off his relatives to ensure his rebirth and forcing them to fend him off to send him back to Hell for good.This one was one of the most underrated and utterly enjoyable entries in the series. What really works here for this one is the rather fun and enjoyable twist this makes for the series by finding something new and original to do in the series, offering up the possibility of Jason not being merely a deformed human being but rather an entity that can inhabit bodies and become possessed at will. This idea of body-hopping and getting to host himself in others in order to continue his rampage makes for some truly original and creative times in here while also making for a great fact of building some solid suspense wondering who's the one to become Jason and continue his rampage. There's even some fine rules and regulations this utilizes here to set that factor in motion which are even better, coming across with a sense of intelligent thought required to pull these thread together tying in Jason's legacy and family heritage that must be utilized here to fully bring the legend to reality makes this quite enjoyable and far more chilling than expected. Beyond this, the film scores so well with the inclusion of some utterly insane action scenes that keep this one going forward at an utterly frantic pace, starting with the opening raid the features the fine camp- stalking here that brings about the massive gunfire-filled trap here that's utterly over-the-top action, the big brawls at the house with the possessed bodies leading to a fine battle in several great encounters, a great attack on campers hiking in the woods with some utterly graphic deaths and the big attacks in the police station which is fun here with the great battles here proving the invulnerability of Jason at that time and taking out the police force in grand style which leads through the streets into the diner attack which has more Gunilla, tons of action shooting through the different work-stations and has plenty of thrilling stalking throughout here which makes this so much fun as a whole. Likewise, the finale is highly impressive with the big resurrection having a profound effect showing the demon crawling into the body leaving the big resurrection and then bringing along the utterly fantastic one-on-one brawl that brings about the great finale that's all kinds of fun which ends this on a high-note. Combined with the fine nudity and great gory kills, these here all give this enough to like over the film's one lone flaw. The main thing here is that with Jason so left out of the film, this one spends a ton of time on exposition and general information about the storyline that not only is there quite a dearth of true Jason action but so many of the actual rules here don't' really make sense at all. The tales of demonic prophecies foretelling familial relation at the heart of ending his reign really make no sense throughout here.

(Not that I am spoiling much)This had to be the worst Friday the 13th movie to date, and lets face it there weren't that many great ones. The huge problem with this is what the heck happened. The last time we saw Jason he was in Manhattan and he was somehow turned back into a kid, in this movie he is again a walking corpse. I can live with that, but then he gets blown up, they made it look so easy, they should have done that from the start. Now though it gets strange as Jason becomes something from like the movie alien or all those body snatcher movies. At this point I am wondering ""didn't I pay to see Jason hack up people directly?"". Then comes the startling revelation that Jason has a sister! What! Get Real!!! There is no way the woman in the first one had a daughter before or after Jason (or before or after her head was chopped off for that matter). If she had a daughter she would have had someone to fall back on and Jason's death wouldn't have pushed her over the edge (most mothers like their daughters more anyway). In the end Jason is killed by another relative, because apparently a relative is the only one who can kill him (how did they come up with that) and the movie thankfully ends.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
25,Wuchakk,"Great intro & first act, but kinda distasteful and convoluted with a cartoony last act",5,18 August 2014,"Released in 1993, ""Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday,"" aka Part IX, is the oddest entry in the series, along with the next one. But this isn't much of a surprise since three of the previous four installments were departures from the typical Friday formula -- Part V, VII (which features a Carrie-like character) and especially VIII (which switches the setting from Crystal Lake to a cruise ship and the big city).The prologue shows Jason back at Crystal Lake. How'd he get back there after the events in Part VIII? The ending of that movie didn't show Jason completely destroyed, so we must assume that he made it out of the sewers of Manhattan and simply gravitated back to his familiar stomping grounds, which is only about 75 miles away. Anyway, the opening is excellent and highlighted by the most stunning female in the entire series, Julie Michaels as Agent Marcus (which is saying a lot in light of the series having the best line of women of ANY movie franchise).Jason's corpse winds up in the morgue in Youngstown, Ohio, and the film takes an interesting twist reminiscent of the 80's cult film ""The Hidden."" Other bizarre additions to the Jason Voohees mythos include a magic blade, a strange ""Jason-Finder General"" character and the disclosure of the only way the infernal monster can be killed and resurrected. I don't mind these revelations as the series was hackneyed after 8 films in 10 years from 1980-89, albeit still entertaining. Besides, there are enough typical Friday-isms to please fans of the series, for instance the entire camp sequence and the prologue, not to mention the return of an iconic character in the finale.Some fans object to the main revelation on the grounds that Jason is supposedly a misunderstood man-child and this movie changes that. Actually the only films fitting this model are Parts II, XI and the 2009 remake. Parts I, V, VI, VII, and VIII were more in line with the idea of Jason as a force of darkness & evil, the curse on Crystal Lake or whatever. And Parts III and IV had him killing a pregnant girl, psychologically torturing the heroine, and attempting to kill a boy after slaying his mother, so he wasn't exactly Lenny from ""Of Mice and Men"" as these critics maintain. Face it, although Jason may have been an innocent deformed child at one time, the seed of evil (possibly a demonic spirit) entered into his heart at some point and he increasingly became a hideous hellish monster and you have to give this entry credit for trying to fill in the bones with corpse flesh, whether you accept these surprises or not.Unfortunately, there's a distasteful element to the proceedings, which is offset by the black humor a bit, and the final act goes so over-the-top with the action and horror shenanigans that the movie becomes cartoonish and laughable. A good example is the campy fight between the deputy and Steven. As such, ""Jason Goes to Hell"" is one of my least favorite in the series, along with Parts III and VII. Nevertheless, it's entertaining enough and gets extra points for trying something fresh and interesting.Besides the awe-inspiring Agent Marcus in the prologue, we get a couple of cute campers, Deborah and Alexis, with Deborah (Michelle Clunie) particularly shining. There's also Jessica, who turns out to be the main protagonist, her mom (the goddess Erin Gray from ""Buck Rogers"") and Vicki from the restaurant. Needless to say, great job on the female front, but they coulda done more with Jessica.For those who care (I don't) this entry seriously ups the ante in the horrific gore factor.As far as locations go, this installment goes back to Southern California in the tradition of Parts III, IV and V; specifically the Los Angeles area: West Hills and Thousand Oaks.BOTTOM LINE: ""Jason Goes to Hell"" gets props for its radical departure from the Friday formula, even while containing ""Friday"" staples: youths, babes, Crystal Lake, slayings and so on. But there's a disagreeable air despite the amusement and the final act spins out of control with quasi-horror zaniness. Still, any movie that features Agent Marcus and Deborah can't be all bad.The film runs 87 minutes (rated) and 90 minutes (unrated).GRADE: C+/B-",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
26,The_Void,Not as bad as the rest of the series,6,5 June 2005,"The Friday the 13th series on the whole isn't worth the film stock it's filmed on, and it really deserves all the negative reactions that it gets; but one thing I don't understand is why this, the ninth part in the series, often bears the full brunt of Friday the 13th hatred. While the film is a long way from brilliant and only serves as a slice of mindless entertainment at best, at least it offers a bit more on the invention front than the previous waste of time's. This time round, Jason has found himself with the ability to change bodies, which makes the action much more interesting as we've got a myriad of different people doing the killing. Naturally, this could have been better handled if they'd added more of a touch of mystery to the proceedings, but for a silly slasher movie; this isn't too bad an idea. Of course, the 'story' and the 'characters' surrounding the central theme of people being gutted with a great big machete isn't up to much, but then again; nobody tunes into this sort of movie for story anyway, and it gives the fans what they want in terms of bloodshed.Jason Goes to Hell was given the subtitle 'The Final Friday', and of course we wern't so lucky due to the release of Jason X and Freddy vs. Jason, not to mention the next Friday the 13th film, which will almost certainly come out. You know that the subtitle is a lie anyway, since Part IV was labelled 'The Final Chapter'. I've wasted my time on all but part 8 of this silly series, and therefore I'm in a position to say that this one beats the dull parts II-VII (and X and FvJ) hands down. The first one will remain the 'best' in the series for being one of the first slashers to raise the bar for gore levels after Halloween, and while this one succeeds only as a camp piece of kitsch; it succeeds in that way admirably and fans of this sort of trash will enjoy themselves with it. One thing I enjoyed about the movie was the tributes to other series', such as finding The Evil Dead's Necronomicon in the basement of the Voorhees' house, and, of course, Freddy's glove at the end of the film. The ending would have been a nice climax to the series if it cut off about a minute before it did and, of course, there weren't any more films. But you can't keep a good movie series down, and, as Friday the 13th and Halloween have proved, you can't keep a bad one down either.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
27,trashgang,"nothing to do with Jason, but what a gory flick",6,27 January 2011,"I'm laughing reading all the reviews. It's so funny to see how some degrade the Friday franchise. I must agree with so many, there weren't all that good. Go see, most of them scored 5 out of 10 or less. But this one is a weird piece. In part 8 it was intended by the director to end the franchise so he did all kind of things to really end it. So far the distributor was Paramount Pictures. But they weren't really known for their horror flicks. We are now already in the nineties and new distributors were found, one of them New Line Cinema and they were able to contact Cunningham and make The Final Jason. it's better known as Jason Goes To Hell. I must agree with so many fans, suddenly after becoming a child again (part 8) Jason is back in business. No explaining were or how he did it but here he is. Also, the script has some weird changes, Jason having a sister, never knew that. Jason being somehow connected with the outer limits. He can give some kind of lightning going up in the sky...But on the other hand, KNB was involved in the effects and KNB was and is still known for their excellent effects. And this flick surely is a show-off by KNB. It's the most, if you watch it unrated, gory in the series and extremely bloody. And for the geeks it is even a quiz in how many references are in it about other horrors. The most viewable one is the Book of Dead or NECRONOMICON EX-MORTIS. Exactly the one used in The Evil Dead. And what they did with Predator 2 (Putting the Alien (1979) skull on the trophy case on the Predator ship was the idea of Stephen Hopkins' as a way of showing off all the different species and creatures that the Predators have hunted and killed.) making the fans warm for a collision between aliens and predators (which became through AvP) they did it here also, the hand of Freddy (A Nightmare On Elm Street) pulling Jason's mask into hell. Exactly 10 years later it became through, Jason vs Freddy, but first you had to see Jason going into space (Jason X).

I know the other films were done on low budgets, but todays low budget films look like I filmed it with my dad's camcorder.  Over bright, video looking etc.  Over acting, and extra plot twists make this film look like a low budget Show Case original (that is a low budget Canadian cable channel).  Awful computer animated special effects, could they get any more phony.  The little creature running around described in one word cheap.  The music is identical to Show Case's.

A lot people said that this is the worst sequel. They were right. I would not really recommend this, unless you are on the same journey as I am. Have I converted to the Jason side? Nope. I don't think the 10th sequel is going to change my mind either. I will still watch and hopefully enjoy ""Jason X"". But I will be honest, Jason is a very cool killer. He just needs better movies.

She says, ""Who's there?"" and runs outside the room (scantily clad, mind you) to see who it is.She's chased outside by a homicidal maniac and runs through the woods, her robe falling off and revealing more pointless nudity. Finally she lures the monster into a circle of gunfire from a SWAT team who finally manage to kill Jason (apparently repetitive gunshots make him implode on impact).Then this balding man pats the half-naked girl -- who is now revealed to be a brainy cop -- on the back and says something like, ""Good work, Sergeant, we'll get a promotion for you!"" Meanwhile she's standing around naked with only a robe.For a moment I thought to myself, ""This is either going to be the worst movie ever made, or a clever parody of its predecessors."" I mean, either the whole nudity part with the female cop was just there for the sake of nudity, or it was a parody of the fact that every ""Friday the 13th"" movie has at least one scene of gratuitous female flesh.Unfortunately my first assumption was correct. This is an awful movie. It only gets worse and worse as time goes on. It's entertaining, sure, in a so-bad-it's-hilarious kind of way.

After constantly coming back in film after film, it was pretty captivating to see how the protagonists of this story would finally manage to defeat Jason. Here, we get to see the origin of Jason's supernatural powers and see how his only living relatives would be the ones that can defeat him.It's more of the screams, chasing, oversexed teens and gruesome images, joined by some off-the-chart acting and dialog and some sci-fi related special effects. The series has definitely took a sharp turn with the plot device of Jason's heart transferring itself to one body and into another, making this film look more like a sci-fi flick rather than a horror movie. And, some plot points were not explained such as how Jason resurrected after the events from the previous film and how the Duke character knows so much about Jason. However, with this film, it does have a unique story-line and some of the action scenes were actually pretty exciting and I thought this movie was a tolerable end to a long rein of Jason Voorhee's terror.Grade C+",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
33,thesar-2,To Hell With It,3,20 January 2009,"'Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday' contains 2 of the best scenes in the series: Best surprise ending and best opening segment. Although I won't spoil the finale, I will say that it wet my appetite for another movie that was ""in the works."" Unfortunately, that film would be another DECADE before released. As for the beginning, I liked it so much since it just told the audience ""to HELL with it: regardless of his toxic waste demise in 'VIII,' you know he's coming back, so why waste any more time?"" and it pretty much summed up the previous eight installments, in just about 10 minutes. No more young adults around the campfire telling the Jason legend and countless flashbacks. In addition, finally someone (in this case, an athletic heroine and the F.B.I.) did something about Jason and (literally) blew Jason away. Well, since that's in the first 10 minutes, it's no spoiler to say, he didn't die. The rest of the film was a bit disappointing since they invented up outrageous multiple new story lines and sets (a Voorhees house? Really? Where was that when he built his flimsy shack in 'Part 2' and who pays the electric bill?) Some of the action was good, I loved seeing Billy Green Bush and Erin Gray and liked how the film poked fun at the Jason myth on TV or in town, not taking itself too seriously (at times.) But I hated not being able to see Jason for the most part (mirrors don't count.) In the previous movie, we learned he can teleport. In 'Hell' we learn he can swap bodies, so bring on multiple Jasons and unfortunately, lessoning the Kane Hodder scenes. Incidentally, Hodder is the best Jason, appearing in the final 4 of the official 'Friday' movies.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
34,Robert_duder,A New Direction with new producers....bad...no...but it can be entertaining,6,18 August 2011,"Jason Goes To Hell takes the series in a new direction entirely. Some would say this is where it truly started to fall apart. New Line Cinema took over the series from Paramount and tried to reboot the franchise by giving Jason Voorhees a history, a family, a back story that was never discussed, a legend that hasn't existed until now, a bounty hunter type tough guy that seemed to know Jason previously, and a beginning that did not pick up where Jason Takes Manhattan left off. So I can understand how this would anger a lot of fans. The thing is I score this particular series purely and entirely on whether I sat here entertained. I mean if you wanted to nitpick the series and start to look at inconsistencies, campy scenes, and ridiculous acting every one of these films would be two out of ten or less. You have to appreciate this film for what it is, see what they were trying to do and just enjoy it. There was plenty about Jason Goes To Hell that I didn't like including the fact that you hardly ever see the actual Jason besides in a mirror and when he's finally resurrected in the last ten minutes. What I did like about it was that they at least tried to give us some history, the character of the bounty hunter, and the opening scene with the FBI 'destroying' Jason.John D. LeMay is actually one of the best heroes of the entire franchise I think. He actually shows a lot of heart and spirit and really holds his own on screen. He makes the camp and ridiculousness seem just a little better. Steven Williams plays the Bounty Hunter Creighton Duke. I would have loved to have seen this character in previous films. I think he's the perfect hunter like Loomis was for Michael Myers in those films. He's got a significant role and is great in it. Steven Culp plays scummy TV anchorman Robert Campbell. His best performance is when Jason possesses him. Once that happens he gives a downright creepy and powerful performance. Same could be said for Richard Gant, a great character actor, who is Jason's first possessee. Gant is terrific playing Jason without actually being Jason. He has the look and the movements down cold. Kari Keegan gets lost in the shuffle of better characters and she is supposed to be a vital character in the overall story as Jason's niece Jessica. Normally I would mention Kane Hodder is definitely the best at being Jason but he is barely in this film, and hardly ever shows up in costume.Newcomer director Adam Marcus tries his hand at the Jason film. This film does often feel like a bit of a mish mash because they don't even try to keep the continuity of the previous films (probably because they were made by Paramount prior to this.) But that isn't fair to the fans. Instead New Line creates a whole new back story for Jason including a sister (because it worked so well for Halloween I would guess) and a niece (Halloween 5 and 6?) And speaking of Halloween there is a little Easter Egg that I think is done purposely when Kari Keegan's Jessica says that they can find her ex-boyfriend ""...out past the Myer's place."" Apparently Sean S. Cunningham (the director of the very first film) returned as producer on this one. I don't feel like he actually had a lot to do with it, that's my guess anyways. I don't understand why they feel the need to tag on the line 'The Final Friday.' Even if they truly believed in their heart of hearts that this was it...why say that just in case its not? When all is said and done the absolutely iconic moment at the end of this film makes it all worth while when the hand of none other than another slasher legend Freddy Kreuger comes up and takes Jason's mask down to hell. A truly awesome ending. 6.5/10",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
35,bowmanblue,Did someone say 'The Hidden?',5,14 July 2014,"Yes, this is the first Friday 13th/Jason film to be handled by New Line Cinema after Paramount got bored of the franchise due to disappointing Box Office returns and sold it to them. Fair play to New Line Cinema – at least they attempted to try something different (well, sort of). After all, the 'masked killer stalking oversexed teens' routine was getting a little stale now (or eight films ago, depending on how harshly you judge the franchise).However, what New Line Cinema thought was different turned out to basically be the plot to an earlier New Line Cinema release called The Hidden. In The Hidden, an alien jumped from body to body while going on a murderous rampage through the city. Here, in Jason 9 (or whatever they called it) you have a monster-slug (which is apparently supposed to be whatever Jason 'truly' is) jumping from body to body while going on a murderous rampage through a city.Yes, people noted the similarities. But, the worst part of all was that The Hidden is a million times better than Jason 9. We don't really see Jason properly until the final ten minutes and before that we've had one 'average human Jason' after another doing the killing.It's not bad, but it's not as great as it wishes it could be. It tried to breathe new life into the franchise and didn't really succeed. It's not bad if you don't mind a horror film like that and have an hour and a half to spare, but it's no classic – definitely one of the more 'forgotten' Friday 13th offerings.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
36,ericstevenson,They lied again!,4,28 February 2017,"In 1984, the fourth ""Friday The 13th"" movie was made called ""The Final Chapter"". They lied and made more until they decided to call this one ""The Final Friday"". They lied again! There's still two more movies made in the continuity after this! Seriously, you should be fined for lying twice. I was perplexed by the description which said that this explained Jason's supernatural origins. No it didn't! It just said he had to be killed by a Voorhees or something. This has one of the highest death tolls of any of the movies. It's kind of ironic considering Jason only kills one person as himself.This movie apparently reveals that Jason's true form is some kind of worm thing. Yeah, and it has the ability to possess people? Well, it's not really a worm. It's more of a snake like thing with little arms. I guess that's supposed to be his true form? Some of the visuals are nice and the last scene is pretty cool, but other than that, it's just dumb. This is even more cruel than the other films in this endless series. At least this one had the police be smart and simply blow Jason to pieces in the beginning. It's still stupid. *1/2",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

For the most part, this is a pointless, gruesome waste of time.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
38,CuriosityKilledShawn,Okay movie with serious lack of skill,6,14 June 2000,"The plot to this movie is just ridiculous. What were they thinking? Any TRUE Friday the 13th fan (myself included) knows that the series officially ended with Jason Takes Manhatten. And this movie here is not a Friday the 13th film. It's a JASON movie. And not a terribly good one either.First off, the make-up for old Jay isn't so cool. It looks fake. The hokey is too small and seems to have been melted onto his face. Plus he doesn't have much screen time (always a mistake in JASON movie). The dialogue and acting (some cast members are competent enough I should stress) is unbelievable. It's so basic! And this JASON movie seems to rip-off plot elements from Evil Dead (the presence of the Necronomicon and the Dagger) and The Hidden. Did Pamela Voorhees use the Necronomicon to bring back old Jay? Does this explain the whole 'Hell Baby' thing going on? It might, but it' never really made clear to us.The showdown at the end is a bit of an anti-climax. There's no real energy or excitement to it. And Jason's decent into hell is just big non-event. A couple of over-sized Cookie Monster hands come up from the ground and drag him thru the suspiciously loose gravel. Zuh? But New Line makes up for this by providing us with an unrated DVD that restores the gore. This is something Paramount never did. Now the movie seems very over-the-top and some of it is really gross. This was the whole idea for parts 1-8. People cringe and freak at the blood and guts. When you cut them out you castrate the movie and it becomes exceedingly dull. So far this DVD is the only glimpse of what the first 8 could have been like.Plus the 1.85:1 anamorphic picture is looking fine. And the DTS 5.1 soundtrack is loud, loud, loud. This is very good when considering the ambient effects and constant surround use. But Harry Manfredini's score is not...good. His music in Friday the 13th Part 1-7 (Fred Mollin for part 8) was dead cool and used screeching strings and orchestra. Now if JGTH he uses a badly out of tune synthesiser. And it's simply awful.Buy this DVD. It makes for a great double-bill with Jason X. And New Line's quality and commitment to making it the best possible DVD presentation is something Paramount would never do.Originally titled Friday the 13th Part IX: The Dark Heart of Jason Voorhees.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
39,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,So bad,3,28 August 2021,"Jason has always been fun to watch. The films of the series deteriorated over time. This movie is the worst. I didn't enjoy it, it was boring. It wasn't a good idea.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
40,Bored_Dragon,The best one so far,6,17 August 2018,"In the previous, the eighth film of the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise, they finally departed from a long-ago shabby template and created something new, but in this desperate attempt to save the franchise they went too far and made a movie so unconvincing that it's even duller than its predecessors. In the ninth, ""Jason Goes to Hell"", they managed to find the right balance. The story returns to the Crystal Lake, but instead of the continuous streaming of pointless massacre that does not lead anywhere, this time the film actually has a complete meaningful plot. There is a prologue, there are an introduction and familiarization with the characters (the previous films completely left out the characterization, because characters were mostly dying after only a few minutes on the screen), complication, culmination, dissolution and epilogue. Although the story is fairly straightforward and linear, this movie has many elements of a thriller, and Jason is becoming a much more complex supernatural being than the gigantic zombie we are used to, which makes ""The Final Friday"" much more interesting than the empty slashers that precede it. There's, unfortunately, less nudity than before, although the girls are top-class, the killings are more in the style of action movies than horror, and the film introduces some new interesting details. The movie somewhat reminded me of the series ""Supernatural"", mostly because of Jason's demonic nature, magic dagger, blood magic, and for a brief moment you will also see the legendary ""Necronomicon"". They have gone so far as to depart from the template that they even gave the movie kind of happy-end, although, of course, in the last scene, they left the door ajar for a possible sequel. This made me confused a little, because the next film is ""Jason X"", not ""Freddy vs Jason"". Well, I guess it will clear up to me tomorrow. The strongest impression on me has left the prologue, the scene before the opening credits, partly because of well-made unexpected twist and partly because of the beautiful nudity of Julie Michaels.6,5/10",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
41,jacobjohntaylor1,The best Friday the 13th movie.,10,15 June 2015,Don't get me wrong the first eight Friday the 13th movies are very scary. But the ninth one is scarier. In this movie Jason's body is destroyed and his heart turns into a worm like monster the possess people. This one people complain to mush about because it is so unrealistic. I care about realistic when I see a documentary. I do not care about thing like that when I go to a horror movie especially a zombie movie. Jason is a zombie in the first one from what I can tell. Yes I know there is a killer in the first one that is more prominent character. But Jason is still in it. He is only in it for less then a mint. But he is in it. The first eight movie are good horror movie they are very intense. This one is more intense then first. The last two sequels that came out after this one are very intense. But has intense as this one. This is the most intense one that is why it is the best one. The remake is the only Friday the 13th movie were I could predict what was going to happen the first time I watched it. So that one is the only one I do not like. This movie has great story line. It also as great acting. It also has great special effects. It is a great movie. See it. it is most sees. It is one the scariest movies ever.,Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
42,tomgillespie2002,A waste of time and celluloid,2,30 September 2015,"For the exhaustive ninth entry into the Friday the 13th franchise, the creative's behind the scenes made the huge mistake of believing that what this franchise needed was something fresh, something out of the left field. After all, we've had eight of what were basically the same film, with only the embarrassing Jason Takes Manhattan managing to move the action away from Crystal Lake. What this franchise needed was to simply stop, but while there are teenagers eager to hand over their cash for 90 minutes of undemanding trash, there's always more juice to be squeezed. So, with Jason as a supernatural being already established, he now has the ability to transfer his soul into different bodies.With Jason (Kane Hodder) melted in toxic waste at the climax of the previous film, the machete-wielding psychopath is inexplicably back at Camp Crystal Lake stalking a woman taking a shower. When she escapes her log cabin, Jason pursues, but is trapped by a small army of FBI agents who routinely blow him to pieces. Yet somehow his heart survives unscathed, and his remains are taken to the morgue for further investigation. His soul passes into the coroner (Richard Gant), who butchers the hospital guards and heads back to Crystal Lake, where a group of partying teens await him. Jason turns into a media sensation, and infamous bounty hunter Creighton Duke (Steven Williams), who claims to be the only one who knows how to truly kill Jason, is employed to take the demon down once and for all.Along with the aforementioned Jason Takes Manhattan, Jason Goes to Hell is the most hated of all the entries by fans of the series. Worst of all, the film leaves their biggest draw - Jason himself - in the background for the majority of the film, while B-movie actors stumble around like zombies doing the killing instead. But aside from the fact that this is particularly terrible entry into a beloved franchise, this is simply a badly made movie, and worst of all, a poorly executed horror. The acting, script, cinematography and score are offensively drab, and there are gaping holes in the story that are simply not explained. Why is Creighton suddenly in prison when he was free in his previous scene? Why does he break the fingers of the man who ultimately has the same goal? Why is Jason suddenly a spirit who can puke his black, putrid soul into other people? If the film at least offered one or two decent set-pieces or memorable murders these factors could have been forgiven. But Jason Goes to Hell is simply a waste of time and celluloid.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

47,insomniac_rod,Doesn't feels like Friday the 13th but still has it's good points. Confession of a die hard fan.,6,27 July 2006,"I understand the hating towards this unfairly bashed Friday sequel. When it first came out I hated it too for the same reason : it ignored the basics of the Friday movies. I mean, it ignored Camp Crystal Lake (one scene does not count!), more machete performed deaths, the ""ki ki ki ma ma ma ma"" sound, and most important of all, Jason. In the supposedly Final Friday we the die hard fans expected a movie with Jason the whole time. We only got 15 on screen minutes of our beloved masked killer. Really, I decided to watch it until 1996; three years after it's original release. I had a hard time digesting the new plot ideas.Call me crazy but it took years for me to like this movie. It's something different with the Final elements. It still has Jason but in a different physical form for most of the time, it also has Crystal Lake but in a different location, it still has death scenes a la Voorhees style but performed by someone different in physical form. The story is interesting and well executed. I dug the Voorhees past and new characters surrounding Jason. I also liked the way Jason was resurrected. Sadly, this is meant to be Friday the 13th. That means Jason Voorhees in his typical clothes, the mask, the machete and all doing the killings in Camp Crystal Lake, not in the town. I understand the whole problem with the rights but still, this just doesn't feel as Friday the 13th. So I decided to watch this movie objectively and I ended up liking it that much that now I consider it as one of my favorites. The movie has it's pros. It has some good acting specially by the cute and talented Kari Keegan and the effective John D. Le May. They are supported by B-favorite Steven Culp and the always great Steven Williams. Allison Smith deserves special mention as the likable and tender Vicki. And Julie Michaels deserves special mention for her hot body. I had to point that out. Anyways, the direction is also pretty good. It's stylish but dark and creepy at some points. This may be the best directed Friday flick. The cinematography and score are also very good which leads to conclude that this is a very well produced Horror movie. Still, just doesn't feels as Friday the 13th which as a synonym of low budget mixed with creativity. Anyways, the big budget helped to create impressive scenes that are now favorites in the likes of fans. The opening sequence when Jason is blown out by the FBI is excellent. Finally, someone managed to take down Jason. The scene is thrilling and still makes my skin crawl. Also, the shocking ending is pretty good. Jason finally reaches hell. Not to mention the Freddy Krueger cameo which is also stuff for legend and for fans. See, this movie has some good points. As a die hard fan of the series for years I please recommend you to watch this movie objectively. Fans like me should forgive Adam Marcus' movie and take it for what it is : a new face to the series.Heck, you don't have to worry anymore. Jason came back to his roots in ""Freddy V.S. Jason"". So forget about this whole new direction.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

49,Anonymous_Maxine,I think I liked it better when Jason was just plain old Jason.,5,13 April 2005,"Sure, the whole Evil Can't Be Killed thing has been a dead horse for decades, but turning the Friday the 13th series in this completely different direction took something away from the movie for me. Sure, it gave the story a lot more possibilities and opened up nearly endless different routes that it could have taken, but it is barely a Friday the 13th film, and while the vast majority of them have been disastrously bad, I still get this weird feeling of loss to see that this one has been changed so much. It's the Hellraiser Inferno of the Friday the 13th series.That being said, it follows that the story structure is by far the best part of the movie. The performances are pathetic throughout, and strangely enough, there are some stomach-turningly convincing murder scenes, yet at the same time there are some scenes where the make-up is nothing short of laughable. Consider when Jason takes the body of the TV producer or whoever that guy was. Once he's in that body, the guy's make-up is exactly the same as the terrible make-up in 70s and 80s zombie movies. It reminded me of the hilarious blue-face make-up that they used in the original Dawn of the Dead. Classic horror or not (I say not), the make-up was ludicrous.It's odd that the movie starts off so differently, with Jason being killed in the first few minutes of the film, and it continues to go down a different path but doesn't really do anything different as a slasher movie. I guess it's interesting to see what the true evil was behind Jason's relentlessness and imperviousness to damage, but on the other hand it isn't really necessary to the movie or the series. Evil Never Dies. It's a cliché but it's enough, really, in this case. We don't need some deep existential meaning imposed on the Jason Voorhees monster, he's a movie monster and not really anything more. It comes off as a little goofy to impose some supernatural definition onto his character, although I like that the film at least tries to acknowledge the fact that Jason turned into an unstoppable killer with really no explanation other than the fact that he just kept getting back up.Indeed, much of the movie revolves around making fun of typical horror movie stereotypes, even stereotypes specific to the Friday the 13th movies, such as the old go up to the lake, have some premarital sex, and get slaughtered. I rather enjoy it when movies have the nerve to poke fun at themselves like that, it's almost like seeing old characters return, like Nancy did in the Nightmare on Elm Street series. And seeing old characters, as Stephen King notes in Bag of Bones, can be like seeing family again.So it was nice to see that the movie was grounded in reality enough to note that it is preceded by a lot of the same movie over and over again. In just about every Friday the 13th movie up to this point, a lot of kids go up to the lake to make out, Jason shows up and gets all stabby and then eventually gets dubiously killed.In this installment that's also exactly what happens, except here it's not Jason doing the killing.Well, it kind of is. But really it isn't. In fact, was it ever?",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

And lastly, the title seems to suggest that Jason goes somewhere other than Camp Crystal Lake: namely, Hell.So it was kind of disappointing when, after a surprisingly original take on a slasher movie's first kill, ""The Final Friday"" sinks into the usual tedious routine. What it does differently from other Fridays, it rips from other, better movies. In this one, Jason can possess other people, so jumps from one body to another. Sound familiar? If you're a horror fan, you probably know ""The Hidden"" and ""The Borrower"" and ""Shocker"". In this case, we've already got a first-class bad guy in Jason anyway. Who wants to see him possess random people?There's also a guy in the movie who looks like a black Walker, Texas Ranger, with the hat and overcoat. He's not as cool as he should be and you get tired of him pretty quickly.

53,kevin_robbins,I kind of feel you can only love this movie if you're an extreme diehard to the series,2,10 May 2021,"Jason Goes to Hell (1993) continues my run through my personal dvd collection. The storyline focuses on Jason's supernatural ability to infest bodies and continue his killing spree. This is also the first hint of Jason being a deadite, from the Evil Dead, with a quick flash to the Necronimicon. The only hopes of stopping Jason is relying on his last living descendants, his sister and her baby. This movie is directed by Adam Marcus (Secret Santa) and stars John D. Lemay (Tour of Duty), Kari Keegan (Mind Games), Steven Williams (It) and Erin Gray (Buck Rogers in the 25th Century). The storyline and display of Jason is the absolute worst of the series (worse than Jason X in my opinion). The majority of the movie is regular people running around killing people ""in the spirit of Jason."" The concept, execution and story all miss the mark and disappoint with this one. I kind of feel you can only love this movie if you're an extreme diehard to the series or don't like the series at all but like this installment as a stand alone movie. I'd score this a 2/10.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

55,drqshadow-reviews,"No Jason, No Budget and the Franchise's Worst Story - Hell on the Viewer",1,26 October 2016,"During the 1980s, only two years passed without an entry in the Friday the 13th series. That's eight films in ten years, and while the quality usually betrayed those short production times, they always felt like kin. Spiritual relatives. It took four years for a ninth chapter to see the light of day, plus a switch from Paramount to New Line Cinema, and somewhere along the way there was a great disconnect. A true B-grade picture in every sense, Jason Goes to Hell is the worst Friday yet, and one of the most desperate, flailing, pointless films I've ever seen. Though veteran blade-swinger Kane Hodder has returned to the role, this Jason bears little resemblance to the cool, creepy psycho killer of the earlier films. Inflated and deformed, at this point he's basically a roid-raging leper in a twisted, vaguely-familiar hockey mask, but he's changed in more than just a physical sense. The story revolves around his black heart, literally migrating from host to host to inspire fresh killings after Jason himself is blown to bits in the opening scene. We've swallowed some absurdly stupid plot devices over the course of this franchise, including a similarly lame-brained ""fake Jason"" angle in 1985's A New Beginning, but this one sets an awful new standard. It plays like cruddy straight-to-video '90s gimmick horror, not the quaintly under-produced slasher material that had typified the series to this point. Needless to say, the acting hasn't improved (somehow, impossibly, it's actually grown much worse) and the production values, which enjoyed a well-deserved bump in Jason Takes Manhattan, are once again cut-rate and pitiful. Not a good look for New Line, proving right out of the gates that they don't understand what they're making and don't honestly care, one way or the other.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
56,Foreverisacastironmess123,"Oof, boy did he ever go to Hell!",6,13 August 2021,"And so after a glorious horror movie era of eighties fun slasher romps it sadly all came down to this... Wow, who knew that our beloved Ever-slaughtering killer zombie on steroids was actually an evil little demon worm from hell the whole time! So in an impressive opening sequence that is quite the surprise if you've never seen this thing before, while stalking his latest 'victim', Jason Voorhies is ambushed and blown to kingdom come by the freakin' army and his remaining body parts are delivered to the morgue, where a coroner is soon sinisterly compelled to eat Jason's dead rotten black heart, and as we all know by the laws of horror movies the poor guy is then possessed by Jason's murderous spirit! Things only get weirder from then as the rest of the movie is Jason trying to track down his last remaining blood relative so that he can be reborn, mask and all! Like any good 'final' movie, it tries to explain away everything by bringing in a load of new ill-fitting claptrap out of nowhere and hoping some of it sticks. I'm sorry but what the hell were they playing at with this movie? Apparently Jason can now only be killed by a chosen one from his bloodline wielding a magic dagger! ! And instead of Kane Hodder being awesome in his suit and hockey mask, we get several rather normal looking guys turning into super-strong Jason-controlled zombies because they swallowed the Voorhies worm that Jason has to deliver with a kiss by the way.. Jesus, could they have done more to make this less of a Jason movie if they'd tried?! To read it the plot doesn't even sound like a Friday the 13th movie, it sounds a lot more like a bad episode of Friday the 13th the Series! I know it was hardly the first ever Friday movie to jump the shark and I totally understand how after eight films it couldn't have hurt to shake things up a bit, but not necessarily like this! In a slightly different form the body-hopping could have worked just fine and been in keeping with the bonkers ending of part eight, with Jason existing only as a spirit and somehow finding a way to possess various people as he butchers his way across the county back to Crystal Lake so that he can be reborn in the waters, or some crap like that! It has a strong start but then it kind of becomes a bit stupid and all over the place with that damn goofy worm.. I really hate the horrendous tacky bad 90s TV horror movie music, it's sooo not Jason, it conveys none of the wonderful atmosphere and tone of encroaching doom that the original score and all its variations did so beautifully, even in the lesser movies. I hate Jason's design too! He looks ridiculous in this movie, he's too bloated, his tumorous head is about to burst out of the mask! Not a fan of the Staypuff Marshmallow Voorhies.. Something I did enjoy though was the totally uncut gore, and Steven Williams was a lot of fun and practically stole the show as Creighton Duke, he's the thing I remember most about this movie. He should have been the hero, as he had a lot more charisma than John D Lemay, who was fine but I found him a bit grating here. It is an entertaining enough movie, I may like it better if it wasn't unfortunately designated as a Jason flick. Undeniably ripped-off as it was from the superior The Hidden, the bodyswapping is interesting and the kills are moderately fun, but to me as it stands it just screwed around with the basic but oftentimes very winning Jason formula too much and twisted things to the point where it barely feels like one of his movies at all. If you just watch the beginning and end you do get a very serviceable ten minute Jason movie. Besides that, I think it's nothing but glorified, self-indulgent fan-fiction trash that sticks out like a sore thumb amongst the real Jason movies. The only thing that makes this movie stand out and be noteworthy is how bad a Jason offering it turned out to be, as a film on its own merit it's really nothing special at all, apart from a few well done scenes and gore, it's pretty unexceptional stuff all around. Enjoyable but very unremarkable - 6 deep-fried midgets out of 10!!! X.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

As one of them is a babe in arms, it's her mother who gets the job, reluctant though she is.Is this the final Friday?

JASON GOES TO HELL is my personal favourite of the whole franchise, it's action-packed fun gross out 90's gore fest!!! Completely original to the rest of the franchise & it's pure late night adult entertainment, this is also the absolute best Jason Voorhees has EVER looked in a movie!!! Kane Hodder is fantastic in the Jason role he's a big bulky & hulking killing machine!!! Another great part of this film is the Bounty Hunter CREIGHTON DUKE played to perfection by the character actor Steven Williams, duke is my favourite character in the whole franchise!!! Duke has a past with Jason & is hunting him down & is a total bad ass who wants Jason Voorhees dead for good!!!Creighton Duke is one of those fantastic side characters who steals the show from everyone else in the movie & THAT'S what type of character the Duke is & he's got an interesting intense but also in control easy going way about him & he dresses really cool like an outlaw bounty hunter from an old western movie he's very cool to watch on screen with his black cowboy hat & tough look & he is someone i always wanted to know more about & would have loved him to have been the main lead in the movie but we got a nerd instead but hey I'm thankful this movie introduced me to Creighton Duke & made me a fan of this mysterious Bounty hunter since i was a young teen watching Jason goes to hell on video!!!Creighton Duke is one of my favourite movie characters of all time not just my favourite Friday the 13th character, i just wish he had a much bigger part & more material out there of this guy.A great cast of characters & lots more on the mythology of Jason Voorhees including the fact that Jason is a deadite!!! You will spot the Necronomican book of the dead in the old voorhees home & the director has said Jason is a deadite & that crosses franchises with Evil Dead & that's Awesome & makes complete sense as to why Jason keeps coming back & doesn't die!!! Brilliantly directed with great special FX & creature designs, yep a fantastic Fantasy Horror in it's own right & a BRILLIANT Friday the 13th movie!!! No need to talk about the whole plot or story just watch it & enjoy. GREAT GORY FUN & great night time entertainment,monster fun with amazing practical fx & creature design & this movie has fantastic music!!!I've loved this action packed Horror since owning it on video & watching it lots late at night & so enjoying it's brutal gross out blood & guts splatter & it's supernatural sense of fun.Personally one my favourites
of the franchise & Well up there with Jason Lives & Jason Takes Manhattan i love those 3 films in the excellent franchise but although i love Jason goes to hell i know it's not perfect & that's why it gets an excellent 9 but not a complete 10/10 & that's because the director Adam Marcus concentrates on the nerd as the main lead who is to be honest an ok very unlikely hero but put the excellent bounty hunter Creighton duke as a little side character? Why? & he left out too much of dukes back story so we have no idea (until recently) why Duke wants Jason so badly & what the history is between them but instead the director concentrates on the nerdy steven character saving the day instead of Duke & his mission!!! Now i like the steven character he's an ordinary guy & it's a well written character & a good performance by John. D.lemay it's just a wasted opportunity for a new AWESOME character like duke to come into the franchise & give it that exciting new life it needed!!!So some massive missed opportunities with an otherwise excellent monster movie & the coolest looking Jason so far!!!Now the nerdy Steven main character is actually pretty good to be honest i mean he is definitely not your usual hero type but that's a good thing as he's not your typical beefed up handsome jock hero but he's an average guy in looks & build & wears glasses so basically very nerdy looking but in a way he's cool just not Tommy Jarvis cool but he does stand up to Jason & has a good fight with him & is quick thinking & smart at times & brave so a good unusual hero he's not terrible or bad it's just i wanted more of Creighton duke & have Steven as a more side character or even have them both work together but hey it is what it is & steven is a good character & he's one of the main stars of the Friday the 13th t.v series so he links that together in a fun way with the movie.ADAM MARCUS why oh why didn't you concentrate on the story of an awesome Bounty hunter tracking down Jason Voorhees??????? It would have been absolutely brilliant & even more different than the others same formula, HUGE MISTAKE!!! But that
Being said i always choose this Friday film over all the rest so i have big love for this crazy action-packed often cheesy but always entertaining entry.To me Jason goes to hell is a perfect example of a cult classic as many don't like it & it's not even considered a friday film because the lack of Jason Voohees himself but it has gradually gathered a fan base over the years but I've been a fan since the 90's when i got it on video so I'm proud to have always enjoyed this movie & it's a million times better than Freddy vs Jason & Jason X.Jason goes to hell is in my top 3 Friday films!!!",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
59,drownnnsoda,Disappointing But Fun If You Don't Take It Seriously.,4,28 August 2006,"Apparently ""Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday"" was intended to be the last film of the series, which it is, if you don't count 2003's ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" as Friday film. This movie starts out with a beautiful young woman in a cabin in the middle of the woods one night (wow, original). She is chased through the woods (wrapped in a bath towel) by Jason, who is then blown up by a mob of FBI swat men into complete smithereens. After his remains are taken to a biology lab, the psycho maniac seems to live on through his heart... and he begins to take over other human's bodies. So, he begins his psychotic slaughter rampage through out the Crystal Lake area, in the body of the coroner who was in charge of his remains, slashing and hacking up teens and others who (unfortunately) happen to cross his path.I enjoyed this film alright, but the whole concept of it was a little far-fetched for me. The whole idea of Jason's 'soul' living on in another body completely threw this out of what one would expect in a ""Friday the 13th"" installment. Aside from this kooky idea, the film has some neat visual effects and is loaded with a heavy amount of gore. Just rent the unrated DVD and you'll see just how bloody this thing is. Along with the gore there is the typical premarital sex between some dumb teens, who ultimately get hacked to death (quite brutally I might add) by Jason one evening. The movie is enjoyable, fun horror if you don't take it seriously. But when it comes down to it, the removal of Jason's body (I suppose that's how you'd say it), this movie is yanked out of the series and doesn't seem to fit very well with the rest (much like ""Jason X""). And the weird ending featuring Freddy Krueger's hand (which is now explained by ""Freddy Vs. Jason"") was a little far out there.Overall, if you're a fan of the series, you'll want to see this I'm sure. While it may not be very good, there is plenty of gore to offer and a few nice touches. But more than likely fans of this series will be disappointed with this movie. 4/10.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

61,JoeKarlosi,Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday (1993) **1/2,6,6 February 2013,"Or, Part 9 in the long-running ""Friday the 13th"" series. It is a tough entry to judge, because on the one hand it's undeniably a pretty strange movie; but then again, after 13 years of repetitious formula films in this franchise, I've got to give this one some credit for at least attempting something radically different for a change. If you are prone to revisiting this series in chronological order from time to time (as I am) it all gets really familiar after about the sixth chapter, so in a way JASON GOES TO HELL seems like a much-needed breath of fresh air. The previous eight films had been released by Paramount Studios. But JASON GOES TO HELL was the first movie made under New Line Cinema, and was written and directed by a 23 year-old film student named Adam Marcus, making his debut film here for better or worse. Its resulting reputation is wildly divided among followers of Jason Voorhees everywhere.This story is unlike any other Friday flick you've ever seen, even if it borrows elements from other horror movies. It starts out with hockey-faced Jason (Kane Hodder) on the prowl and possessing a coroner (I won't tell you how; the opening of the film is pretty cool) and then the soul of Jason is able to be transferred from one person's body to another's, resulting in many pseudo-Jasons roaming about. There is a comical bounty hunter named Creighton Duke who turns out to be the only expert on Earth who knows how to stop Jason's mayhem for all time and send him to hell. All of the many odd plot points scattered throughout this film contradict just about anything else we ever thought we'd known about Jason up to now, but then this approach is all either a complete load of bull crap, or an interesting new approach...take your pick. But one area where JASON GOES TO HELL should deliver for any hardcore fan is in its gore effects, at least when watching the preferred ""Unrated Cut"". **1/2 out of ****",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

63,aidanratesmovies,Exhausted attempt of a long gone franchise,1,16 November 2020,"This film is a disaster. I can't think of a single positive thing to say about this flick, it's easily one of the worst films I have ever seen, and often it is so bad, it's quite comical. I guess a bit like my review here, the film starts quite abruptly and all together feels incredibly out of place. Its editing is absolutely horrendous, its plot is all over the place, and its dialogue and kills are often quite ridiculous- and not in a good way. There are several moments in this film that I laughed out loud at, not because they were necessarily funny, or meant to be that way at least, but they were simply too ridiculous to bear- and their execution on screen just made it all the more better. Whoever wrote this piece of crap seriously did not know how to write a script, let alone a story and the characters within it. The acting is a mess, from forgettable, to dull, to all together over the top, the film just doesn't have a single thing going for it. I mean seriously,it looks like they spent more effort on creating the poster for the film than they did the actual movie! On top of that, the film also has no atmosphere, or any decent cinematography to even make the film look or feel like the others, not to mention the sound, which is so awful I often couldn't hear parts of the film. In the end, Jason Goes to Hell is yet another unnecessary attempt at resurrecting an already dead franchise. It goes to show you can't keep kicking a dead horse, no matter how many twists you make for the plot, sometimes it's just better to finally let it be, or in the case of these flicks, let Jason die.

Even though Part 4 was titled: The Final Chapter, now we get to see the Final Friday, 4 movies after the final chapter. Part 9 tries to be as good as Part 7, the only problem is that the camp atmosphere is not present and there are hardly any campers? Instead, Jason has finally gotten national notice so a team of ""SWAT"" like police men come to finally put an end to him. ""I don't think so."" From the opening scene where we get a taste of everything that Jason has offered his audience in the last 13 years, it is all down hill.

The film is about Jason body-hopping and trying to reach a body with the same DNA as his original body so he can be whole again. I like the concept behind the film, the design of Jason and the Easter Eggs peppered throughout the film like the Book of the Dead from Evil Dead and Freddy's glove. However this film fails in execution, not because ""Jason isn't in most of the film"", like so many fans like to complain about. The film is poorly directed, it is as simple as that. And some of the acting is outright awful and made even more noticeable by the directing. Regardless, the film has its moments. Like the ending with the semi-Freddy cameo and some of the scenes with ""businessman Jason."" So in conclusion, it is not one of the top 5 Jason movies but it isn't the worst... maybe?

68,Reviews_of_the_Dead,"Innovative, but Flawed",5,1 July 2019,"Now I do have to admit, this film I saw a lot growing up. This one came out at the time when I was renting a lot. I'm pretty sure my sister and I rented this one quite a bit, so I'll admit I have quite a bit of nostalgia for it. I did watch this about a year and half ago for a podcast Movie Channel, so this is my second time watching this with a more critical eye. The synopsis is serial killer Jason Voorhees' (Kane Hodder) supernatural origins are revealed.This film starts with Elizabeth Marcus (Julie Michaels) driving up to a cabin in the woods. The lights aren't working so she goes to a shed for light bulbs. She is spooked though when the light goes out in the shed as well. She then goes upstairs to take a shower. She undresses and gets in, but the power goes out again. When she goes to see what the cause was, the door opens and then she is attacked by Jason. He manages to slice her, but she runs out into the woods.She comes to a clearing and stops. When Jason appears, lights come on and a bunch of federal agents open fire on him. He is finally blown up. It turns out that Elizabeth is a FBI agent and that this was all a set up. Jason is now thought to be dead.The body is taken to Youngstown, Ohio where an autopsy on the remains is to be done. The coroner in charge is Richard Gant. He begins the autopsy, but when he is checking out the heart, he starts beating. He looks at it and sees it moving. This sound and movement hypnotizes him until the point that he actually devours the heart. We then see lights entering him. His assistant comes back and he murders him. He also kills the two security guards and vanishes into the night.We then shift to a news show, where the anchor Robert Campbell (Steven Culp) is reporting on these events. The question is posed, is Jason really dead? Culp interviews a bounty hunter, Creighton Duke (Steven Williams), who thinks that Jason is still alive and he is asking for a reward to kill him.The film goes back to the town that has been plagued by him. The local diner is owned by Joey B. (Rusty Schwimmer). The guy she is seeing, Shelby (Leslie Jordan) also works there along with Vicki (Allison Smith) and Diana Kimble (Erin Gray) are also waitresses there. They both think it is in bad taste to exploit what has happened for profit. Joey won't hear any of it. Duke is actually at the diner and tells Diana he knows her secret and asks for her help. She tells him that Jason is dead and she freaks out. She is dating Sheriff Ed Landis (Billy Green Bush), who gets supset with Duke and arrests him. Diana then talks to a guy sitting at the counter, Steven Freeman (John D. LeMay). He had a child with her daughter and tells him to come over that night at 11, she has a secret to tell him involving her daughter and their child.When Diana gets home, she gets a call from Jessica (Kari Keegan), her daughter. She is telling her she will be out next weekend so she can meet her new boyfriend. Diana informs her about Steven coming over and Jessica wants him to see the child. The problem is that the call is ended short. Jason is able to jump bodies and is now in one of the local police officers. Steven shows up and tries to save Diana. The problem is that the possessed cop kills her. Steven becomes the prime suspect as he tries to stop this supernatural monster.As most will know about me, the story is what really draws me into a movie. I can overlook a lot of things if this aspect of the film is well done. This film has problems that it ignores the previous film where Jason was killed in Manhattan, how did he end back up by Crystal Lake? I did read that there is a comic book that explains he went on a murder spree back hence why the FBI is on to him. That is plausible, but I would have liked that there to be something.I've kind of already established this, but growing up; this was one of my favorite films. As an adult, I see all the flaws in it. I do like that this one tried to do something different with making Jason able to take over other bodies. I do not like that the rules don't seem to be consistent. The one that really bothered was a cheap trick near the end where she doesn't know who is possessed, but both of them can talk normally. None of the others had this ability. This one also adds other Voorhees family members we never heard of and a new mythology to Jason. I can't hold that against the film too much, but that is the problem with sequels on a franchise that was never intended to run this long. I don't mind this explaining how he has been able to live as long as he has, but there are issues with it. My biggest gripe is that if he can possess a Voorhees, his body will go back to what it was or the fact that when he walks past a mirror, he looks like his old self. I had issues with both of these.I do have to say though; the pacing for this film is actually really good. It gets right into it with what happens at the cabin and we never really go too long without a death. Despite the flaws in the story and some things irking me, overall it keeps my attention and is actually quite entertaining. It can be a bit clunky, but I think that is due to some story elements were removed. That could have been fixed. I also don't mind the ending and I do find it intriguing the Easter Eggs in this film from Evil Dead and Creepshow.The acting in this one is subpar as well. LeMay doesn't have the look of a hero, but he wasn't horrible. He did overact at times and had some bad lines. I do like the growth of his character though for sure. Keegan was nice to look at and was probably one of the better points. Hodder is my favorite actor to play Jason, since I grew up with the films he played this role in. Williams is a good concept, but way too outrageous for me. It doesn't make sense that he knows so much though. They establish him as an expert. I really liked Schwimmer and Jordan though, they cracked me up. There were quite a few good looking women and some nudity, so that doesn't hurt either for a slasher like this.I will say that a bright spot to this film was the effects. They were done practically and I thought they looked very realistic. This was one thing that I could take from this film that was well done. This one does have some computer effects, but that is mostly for the possession of the coroner and for the death sequence. Both were fine and the film is shot well overall.Something else I really liked was that the soundtrack was done by Harry Manfredini. This one takes some of the iconic songs we are used to and updates them for this film. I'm a big fan of theme of this one and I think the songs he produced fit the scenes. They definitely helped to build the tension as well in my opinion.This franchise is one of the best in the horror world and this film has a soft spot in my heart, but as an adult I can see how flawed this film is. It has a lot of plot-holes in it, but I will give the story credit for trying to do something new. The acting is fine with a couple good spots here and there. Hodder was solid as Jason for one. The effects were good, but there were slight issues with the editing. Score was actually one of the best spots for sure. I do feel that his is a popcorn film and is still enjoyable despite my lower rating. Don't take this one seriously and just watch it for all the kills. I would only recommend to those that are fans of the series or bad horror.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
69,Movie-ManDan,One of the Worst Movies I've Ever Seen.,1,9 November 2017,"Although iconic, the ""Friday the 13th"" are not very good. Of the three top slasher series (Halloween and A Nightmare on Elm Street being the other two) ""Friday the 13th"" doesn't have any truly good instalments that are clever or are works of art. ""Friday the 13th"" has had more bad instalments than the others and the ones that I have given thumbs up to are mostly either mercy votes, or I simply got to know the series well. After watching all eight ""Friday the 13th"" flicks, I got to know what to expect and how to truly understand it. The thing with horror movies is they often need to be treated differently. If you analyze a horror movie like you do with any other kind of film, I guarantee you'll hate it. That's how I got to get through the ""Friday the 13th"" series. Even after doing this, the ninth instalment was still sooooooo bad!Jason Goes To Hell is the ""Friday the 13th"" flick that finally explains how Jason survives and keeps coming back from the dead. In the previous films the when he comes back to life, it is pretty interesting and plausible in the world of slashers. This seems to contradict the previous films in such horrible and ludicrous ways. It is explained that Jason's spirit can jump from body to body. Supposedly that's why his mother was the killer in the first film and why that crazy guy killed in Part 5. So Jason's spirit roams but it still unclear on how the same being goes on the killing sprees. They tried to explain, but it didn't make sense.So the movie opens up with Jason being blown to bits by the feds and an autopsy being done to see how he can come back. Seems safe, considering he's been exploded into smithereens. Richard Gant is a doctor who is summoned to eat Jason's heart and take over the killing spree. The moment Gant eats his heart, I was done. Some other people embody Jason in other mega-trashy scenarios. Their tongues become ugly snakes and they summon little creatures to help them with the kills. One dude explains how to kill Jason--the only thing about nature that makes perfect sense.I totally hate when years of something is flushed down the toilet for something extremely stupider. That's why I hated the Rob Zombie Halloween remakes. But Jason Goes To Hell is actually worse. The only good moment is near the end when we see the real Jason come and raise hell. I've always found Jason to be an awesome presence. Him going to hell was kinda cool too. They don't actually show him in hell, but whatever. This little bit of Jason that they do show is barely a plus. And believe it or not, the acting in this (although pretty bad) is not as bad as in some other instalments.The only thing that kept me from not awarding this any stars is this was able to sustain my interest of Jason's supernatural. Although it didn't pay off, the sustainment prevented a 0-star.0.5/4",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
70,ctomvelu1,Pretty bad,4,3 November 2012,"Strictly speaking, this isn't a true Friday the 13th movie, even though Jason makes a brief appearance at the beginning and end -- and they are the only watchable parts. Jason is blown up at the outset and his still-beating heart takes over various cast members, turning them into homicidal maniacs. The plot was lifted from a low-budget 1980s sci-fi flick (title mercifully forgotten) and The Terminator. It also steals from some Halloween sequels. New Line spent $2 million on this turkey, and few went to see it, with good reason. Kane Hodder is Jason once again, and Steve Williams is a hunter on Jason's trail. Except for the most ardent Jason fans, this is hardly worth viewing.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

As a fan of ""Fallen"" I like the idea of the villain transferring from person to person, but they twist the concept a bit more than I would have wanted at points.Adding a ""chosen one"" trope to this doesn't do much for me. Having a nearly unkillable villain alone should be intriguing enough, adding extra rules to it doesn't feel good.I'd like to see a Marvel style reboot where the government has to try to contain the heart, and they figure out the minimum safe distance, creating a facility around it with animals going nuts, and someone breaks in to find out what it is and is possessed.It's not a great movie, and it's probably a bad ""Friday the 13th"" movie, but I enjoyed it for what it is.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

And then the video game.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
73,Sandcooler,"What is this, a rejected Ernest idea?",6,6 June 2007,"Every time I see a Jason movie, I wonder about the same thing over and over again: why doesn't he just walk in there right now and kill everybody at once? Well, I'm glad to say the diner scene from ""Jason Goes To Hell"" gives us pretty much exactly that. This entry is by far the most violent of all the ""Friday the 13th""-movies, not only because there are so many kills but also because they're so damn brutal. The tent scene is just an instant classic if you have a disturbed mind. Same with the woman who gets her head crushed until her brains splash out in a glorious fountain, it's not great cinema but it's so damn entertaining. Don't give any thought to the plot though, it'll only confuse or depress. Just cover your ears and scream ""lalalalalalala"" during those scenes. Huh, Jason can hop bodies? He's got a house and a sister? What, a magic dagger? Why is he shaving? Oh wait forget it all, people are getting killed again. This is the part where even the last bit of sense the series still made is being thrown in the dumpster, but I can't hate it like a real ""Friday""-purist because this is easily one of the more riveting entries. Watch at your own risk.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
74,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,A really botched entry in this series,2,24 April 2003,"Jason is lured out into an open field where the FBI is waiting for him in an ambush, (In all the other movies no one believed Jason was alive, why do they now?) he's then hit with a missile and blow to pieces, about five minutes into the movie. Then after a LENGHTY credits sequence, we find out Jason's body may have been destroyed but his spirit/ soul is still alive and quite angry. He then possesses several people, trying to be reborn by his heretofore unmentioned sister. Good premise, if not original, but the camera work is sometimes grainy and out of focus, the gore is badly done (all the blood looks like black paint) The music score to this movie is HORRIBLE! It sounds like someone is mashing down all of the major keys on a piano at the same time. The opening title sequence, and its horrendous music score, just seems to go on forever. Unbearable! All of the characters in this movie are obnoxious, so we don't care who is killed. The story is inconsistent with the rest of the films in this series, and it ends up being just a really missed opportunity of sorts. When Jason is reborn at the climax of the film, why is he still rotten and shredded, with bullet holes and machete cuts still in him? Shouldn't he have been good as new, again? At the climax, giant, floppy muppet hands reach up from the ground and grab Jason and pull him down to Hell; that looks more unintentionally funny than anything. The unrated version is mediocre at best, the heavily edited ""R"" rated version will put you to sleep, or annoy you to the point you just cannot watch any more.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
75,Gislef,Great camp movie,6,19 June 2001,"This movie doesn't take itself to seriously, which is great. From the parody opening, to the in-joke references to much better ""camp"" movies like Army of Darkness and Creepshow, to the absurd levels of violence (everybody in the diner has a gun?!?), to the set-up for the (so far unseen) Freddy vs. Jason sequel, this movie just bounces right along.  Steven Williams seems to be having a great time in the Robert Show/Quint role, and John D. LeMay is an absurd hero-type in the Ashe/Bruce Campbell role: he gets beat up, shot, and takes enough of a beating to kill Jason himself, but keeps coming back for more.  Watch it with some friends and feel free to MST it.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
76,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Jason Goes to Hell""- I'm sorry, but I appreciate and applaud the boldness of this entry. An interesting experiment in shaking up the franchise for the ""Final Friday.""",5,14 September 2016,"If there's one thing that can and should be said in defense of ""Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday"", it's this......this is one bold, gutsy move for the franchise! Completely subversive and joyously disparate when placed in comparison to the previous eight films. A bizarre, red-headed-stepchild with a strange and sharp leaning towards the overly fantastical and blatantly magical. Taking what had been to that point an increasingly repetitious series, and attempting to inject some fresh blood for what was at the time considered to be the one... last... film to cap it all off.Is is a success? Well, I'd say for the most part, fans do consider it a failure because it strayed so much from the formula in trying to establish a grandiose finale. And I think I would probably consider it to be a bit of a failure for that very same reason. But it's definitely a fascinating and daring failure. One that I can get behind. Especially after the increasing monotony of the previous two films. Sue me, but I'll take an interesting failure that attempts to shake up the formula over a bland retread any day of the week!Jason Voorhees has finally been killed. After an FBI Sting Operation blows his body to smithereens, the town of Crystal Lake is finally able to settle down, knowing the figment that has haunted them for so many years is finally gone.Or is he?Nope! As it turns out, Jason has become something more than human, and his evil has given him the ability to possess others through some sort of relatively-unexplained magical means. Now, Jason is coming back to seek vengeance, taking the forms of various characters through body-swapping, intent on locating surviving members of the family, so that he may be reborn again through them in his original form. Now, his only living relative (Kari Keegan), her ex (John D. LeMay) and a bounty hunter who knows the truth about Jason (Steven Williams) must team up to stop him once and for all!Look, this movie's ridiculous. It's completely out of left-field. It doesn't really connect properly with the previous films. Its storyline is just bizarre. And it's a completely different beast tonally from any of the other flicks......but it's a lot of fun!Director Adam Marcus and writers Jay Huguely and Dean Lorey seem to have a ton of ideas on how to exploit this ridiculous concept, and are given free reign to just go crazy. There's a little something for everyone here. From a touch of the self-aware laughs that made ""Jason Lives"" so enjoyable, to some wild and whacked-out imagery (you won't look at a straight-razor the same way again!) to some good old-fashioned kills that harken back to the first couple of movies, this film aims to deliver a roller-coaster ride from Hell... and it does deliver on that promise.Add to that some likable performances, fun and inventive kinetic camera-work that knows how to make the best of it's lowish budget, weirdly entertaining humor and plenty of gore to go around... and it produces a film that I find to be a decent bit of dumb-fun.This movie is stupid. Beyond belief. And it doesn't feel anything like the previous eight outtings. But I'm OK with that. It's got a lot of insane-o concepts and ideas to play with, it knows exactly what it wants to be, and it's got some fiendishly creative minds at it's helm. It's a failure... but an entertaining and wildly ambitious failure that I can't help but root for.So I'm giving it a middle of the road 5 out of 10. If you're a fan of the franchise and are open minded, give it a shot. You might be one of the proud few who really enjoys this off-the-rails nutcase- of-a- flick.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
77,rivertam26,A cinematic blast of genre goodness,8,11 March 2020,"This is without a doubt one of my favorites of the franchise. It all begins when Jason tries to takedown an undercover FBI agent (whose footwear keeps changing as she's chased through the woods) and he's blown to bits in a spectacular, over the top fashion. The doctor doing the autopsy is seduced into eating his black heart and from than on it's a whole bunch of body switching like 1987s The Hidden but way amped up. The masked maniac is a demon parasite in search of a family member so that he can become his old self again. It's all a bit goofy and there are some unintentional funnies but who cares. The movie is fantastically gory and overly entertaining. Not only does it have the best kills of the series but also has the best kill of any slasher ever. The ""tent split"" is beyond amazing and needs to be experienced in it's full unrated cut like the rest of the glorious film. And as a horror fan how can I not appreciate all the homages and genre universe expanding. From the Halloween references to the Necronomicon from Evil Dead which makes Jason a full fledged deadite to freddy's glove dragging his mask into hell.

If you think being head and limbless will stop Mr. Voorhees from returning to his murderous ways, think again. Now we learn that he can be ""reborn"" through a blood relative and can possess victims by sending an evil black monster into their bodies (idea stolen from THE HIDDEN).In a touching tribute to the good ol' days of simplicity, overage-looking ""teens"" make time for skinny-dipping and tent sex before Jason splits the girl in half with a tent stake. This ninth installment in the endless Friday THE 13TH series features a good cast, but is derivative, annoying, unpleasant and not likely to be the final word in the Jason saga, despite ANOTHER cheat title (remember ""The Final Chapter"" way back in 1984?).It played theaters in a cut R version (where it flopped), but the unrated ""Director's Cut"" video and DVD version restores most of the excellent KNB Group gore effects and some nudity, redeeming factors in a low-grade production like this.

Jason Voorhees is alive and back at Crystal Lake, without explaining how he returned from New York. During the first five minutes, he's blown up and we don't see 'Jason' again till the last ten minutes of the movie. Jason randomly has a sister now who needs to die because it's revealed that the only way to kill Jason for good is that a Voorhees can do it. Steven Williams as Creighton Duke is definitely one of the most interesting and intriguing characters of the whole series. Not much is known about him, but he's a bounty hunter that's had a run-in with Jason before. He knows how to kill Jason for all time.After Jason Voorhees is blown to bits, his black gooey heart is eaten by the mortician that's performing the autopsy. Jason's spirit soon possesses the body and continues his murder spree. We soon meet Steven Freeman, a man who is the father to Jason's Great Niece. Steven must protect her and his girlfriend from Jason and send him back to Hell. Throughout the movie, Jason switches from body to body and it all leads up to a final confrontation at the Voorhees house. The Necronomicon from 'Evil Dead' makes a cameo. (Perhaps Pamela Voorhees used it to try and bring Jason back to life) The ending is a great prelude and tie-in to Freddy Vs. Jason, a movie that was years in the making.

81,baumer,"What a great beginning, too bad the rest sucked",6,14 July 1999,"I was so excited when the beginning of this film was before my eyes. The music, the darkness, the atmosphere. The beginning of this movie starts off just like the first four. It was tense and it had the exact feel of what we all loved about the early Fridays. The chase, the unnecessary nudity, the false scares, the mirror, and finally Jason in all of his gory splendor coming back one more time to wreak havoc on Crystal Lake. But then suddenly, he is blown up. He is dead, for real this time. I mean he is not like the T-1000 from Terminator that can put himself back together. So how does the movie go on from here? Well to be honest, if the film would have ended after the first ten minutes, I would have been more satisfied than I was at the end of this film. Simply put, I was cheated. I was enticed with what seemed to be a perfect Friday the 13th feel and then they went back to what made the last few suck so bad. What the hell were they thinking? Why the blatant disregard for us as horror fans? And why did they start off so well and then just kill us when Jason dies? By having his spirit enter into the body of some other people, it is a theme that has been done before. And to have the talent to make the Friday feel, and then deviate from that feel, well that is just despicable.For those of us that really like the films from the early 80's, we were teased. We were lied to and for that I am still mad to this day. And to be honest, when I found out that New Line had decided to produce the films instead of Paramount, I knew that some how, some way, there would be some Freddy reference in it. And besides the beginning, that was actually the best part. Now if they only find a way to make the next film somewhat entertaining, then it could be fun again.

83,mattymatt4ever,What the hell?,5,12 November 2002,"The ways of bringing Jason back just get crazier by the sequel, but this is the absolute craziest.  Crazy is too light a word; ludicrous is more like it.  The opening sequence is really cool.  A woman's taking a bath, she flees from Jason, he chases her through the woods and BAM!!!  Beams of light surround him.  That's when we find out she's really an agent and a SWAT team jumps down and shoots him to bits.  Now, Jason's body has literally fallen apart.  Ain't nothing we can now, right?  Jason is taken to the coroner's office, the coroner gives him an autopsy and suddenly Jason's heart starts beating.  Then, out of the freakin' blue, the coroner grabs the heart and devours it like a sandwich!  Then supposedly, Jason's soul enters his body and every time he looks in the mirror, he sees Jason's reflection.  Now, once we got to the heart-devouring scene, I was ready to puke--not because it's disgusting, but because of how idiotic it is.Now, this isn't a terrible movie, but it's only watchable on an entertainment level.  The story just gets dumber by the minute.  Hell, the previous Jason sequels weren't heavy on logic, but they allowed the audience to suspend a fair deal of disbelief.  Besides, it sucks that we hardly get to see Jason--mask and all--throughout the movie.  ""Jason Goes to Hell"" also lacks a certain charm that the other movies had. I'm guessing this was made on a higher budget and the director and producers were actually trying to accomplish things that weren't accomplished in the previous movies.  But this is no more than B-horror trying to disguise itself as A-horror.  There's only one cool death scene that will stick in my mind and that's when the girl is in the tent having sex, she goes on top and her body is sliced in half by Jason.

It's amateurish in every way possible; the script is bad, the direction is nonexistent, the editing horrible, the special effects not good, the acting awful. I had already posted a review stating that the fifth installment of the series was the absolute worst, but how wrong was I? This is the worst without a doubt.

86,fmarkland32,Hell after Harlem...,4,14 June 2006,"After Jason was killed in the last 8 entries, it seems rather stupid to try and explain that this would indeed be the last time, especially since they would go back on their word, also their Final Chapter was hardly the last. However this time the story is a little different as now Jason has been led into an ambush and is blown to pieces, however his evil heart lives on and he possesses various people to kill people who are a threat to his immortality, as a bounty hunter says that only a Voorhies can kill him, this of course leads to his sister, niece and grandniece, they are the only ones who can stop him. Jason Goes To Hell:The Final Friday is titled a little weirdly in that New Line had just bought the franchise and yet they claimed to only make one movie out of it? However the problem here is that the mumbo jumbo explaining Jason's evil isn't very well explained and although it's admirable to offer an explanation, just as many unanswered questions surface. For instance is the character of Duke(Missing In Action 2's Steven Williams) who seems to know about the rituals and such. Where did he find this out? Of course nobody expects logic in a ninth entry in a series but give us something. Also of great disappointment is that Jason is hardly in it, at the beginning and at the very end.

What the hell is this movie? This is not a Jason movie it is simply the worst film ever! This is not Friday the 13th movie the rights was held with New Line Cinema and they come up with this? I thought would be fun boy was I wrong! Maniac Cop 3: Badge of Silence come out the same year and it was more entertaining then this peace as a sh*** pure garbage STINKER! Who made this movie is really retarded and dumb I don't respect him. Trough whole movie there was no Jason in it. This just isn't a good movie I mean wtf?!Suddenly Jason has a sister we never knew about now he has a niece and Jason's heart keeps popping out when FBI blow's him to pices and then he keeps shape shifting from a body to a body really stupid. The actors are terrible this movie sucks and it is the worst Friday the 13th movie ever I wish I wouldn't had that movie in my collection I really wish that. This movie is wooden terrible, none of the characters are likable I just don't care if Steven Williams is in this movie I just don't. New Line Cinema fu**** up this movie Jay Huguely, Adam Marcus and Dean Lorey really screw up and that a lot so no I dislike this movie more then I do part 3 and 5 those two movies weren't that horrible awful! I just realized something this movie stole and copied the idea from The Hidden (1987) about the host changing bodies that's what this movie did. It stole the vision of the director Jack Sholder and I have no respect for this movie! The Biggest waste of time ever. No Jason. Concept is stupid and every scene after another is pointless this movie is stupid! This movie f***** sucks!!! This move lacked I mean what gory? I don't care about the kill scenes I don't care about this goddamn movie why was I so stupid to purchase this peace a sh** movie in my Blu-ray collection I am so disappointed. And I thought Friday the 13th Part 3: 3D and Friday the 13th Part 5: A New Beginning are bad, boy was I wrong this movie is horrible I will never watch it again. I want I don't care about this movie. If people are buying and love this movie good for them I just don't understand. Why does another Voorhees has to stab with the dagger Jason's heart to put Jason back in hell? Tommy chained him in part VI: Jason Lives I think that movie should have end the franchise in my opinion.It started well in Crystal Lake and we see a great babe Julie Michaels as getting naked Agent Elizabeth Marcus that was undercover to lure Jason out that was great scene and when FBI blowed him away to pices that was great but then it turned out in to an ugly peace a sh** mess. My opinion is I don't like this movie I regret to have it on the Blu-ray disc and I will never watch this movie again. It is a waste of time at least I really hoped this movie will be good like A Nightmare on Elm Street or Maniac Cop 3: Badge of Silence but no this movie failed flat.

90,eminkl,They don't understand and don't honestly care,1,18 April 2020,"During the 1980s, only two years passed without an entry in the Friday the 13th series. That's eight films in ten years, and while the quality usually betrayed those short production times, they always felt like kin. Spiritual relatives. It took four years for a ninth chapter to see the light of day, plus a switch from Paramount to New Line Cinema, and somewhere along the way there was a great disconnect. A true B-grade picture in every sense, Jason Goes to Hell is the worst Friday yet, and one of the most desperate, flailing, pointless films I've ever seen. Though veteran blade-swinger Kane Hodder has returned to the role, this Jason bears little resemblance to the cool, creepy psycho killer of the earlier films. Inflated and deformed, at this point he's basically a roid-raging leper in a twisted, vaguely-familiar hockey mask, but he's changed in more than just a physical sense. The story revolves around his black heart, literally migrating from host to host to inspire fresh killings after Jason himself is blown to bits in the opening scene. We've swallowed some absurdly stupid plot devices over the course of this franchise, including a similarly lame-brained ""fake Jason"" angle in 1985's A New Beginning, but this one sets an awful new standard. It plays like cruddy straight-to-video '90s gimmick horror, not the quaintly under-produced slasher material that had typified the series to this point. Needless to say, the acting hasn't improved (somehow, impossibly, it's actually grown much worse) and the production values, which enjoyed a well-deserved bump in Jason Takes Manhattan, are once again cut-rate and pitiful. Not a good look for New Line, proving right out of the gates that they don't understand what they're making and don't honestly care, one way or the other.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
91,The_Movie_Cat,"""About the saddest looking sack of s**t I've ever seen.""",2,29 August 2001,"WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS
Can a sequel be watched in isolation? When I saw the Halloween and Nightmare series I watched each entry in order. Yet other than the original several years ago I've never before seen a Jason movie.Maybe if I had then I'd be privy to lots of nuances and depth lost on me while watching Goes To Hell. Maybe if I had seen parts 2-8 then I wouldn't have thought this film was an insufferable piece of tripe.The movie opens with Jason shot by over a hundred bullets and blown apart by high explosives. Unperturbed by this, his brain lives on, telepathically urging the autopsy Doctor to eat it. Yes, really. The Doc does so in a full-gore depiction, while energy lights from Jason's remains fly out and possess him. This leap from body to body continues, so that even the dubious merits of seeing a murderer in a hockey mask are discarded in favour of secondary actors with mascara hamming a ""possessed"", zombie-like pallor. There is some Freudian perspective to be had from the Jason hosts' retractable black tongue, though this is surely unintentional. Jason is finally reborn after a red creature grows out of a man's slit throat and rapes a dead mother's corpse. Classy. The high fantasy element takes any level of reality, and therefore fear, away from the movie, but I guess no one bothered to tell the makers.Scares are non-existent. When a shot Jason (in the form of a police officer) ""unexpectedly"" comes to life and grabs a woman's leg, we see his eyes open several moments before the ""shock"" grab, thus negating any suspense. Most of the film works along the same principles, with all scares either signposted or pushed aside to make way for blood and guts violence that fails to compel. The flatness of the direction, coupled with possibly the world's most irritating incidental music, make the whole thing distinctly dirge-like.Charismatic Steven Williams is leagues ahead of his ultra-forgettable co-stars and is wasted in stuff like this. The fair majority of horror films are lacking in value, but Goes To Hell makes no attempt at artistic worth. The performances, dialogue and plot possess not an iota of inspiration. Didn't the first one have a low-key, independent feel? This one is the brightly-light product of a studio, while a series of gore-riddled set pieces vie for attention.You sense that parts are actually supposed to be funny, but as the ""humour"" is so lame and overstated a post-modern satire this isn't. Jason Goes To Hell is everything you associate with bad horror movies, threaded half-heartedly together in semblance of a narrative. The only scene that rises above tedious is the final shot where a claw glove grabs Jason's mask... a clever play on the much-touted Freddy vs. Jason flick. Maybe if Freddy had made an appearance it would've livened things up, for this is a thoroughly dull affair.Final marks then:Irrelevant macho fights that drag on and do nothing to further the plot: just the one.Gratuitous topless shots: 3Gratuitous and witless uses of the word ""f***"": I lost count, sorry.Film's score: 2/10.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
92,fernandoschiavi,"The producers clearly tried to expand the Jason Voorhees mythology and try something new, but failed",4,11 September 2021,"After the eighth film fiasco, Paramount sold the franchise rights to New Line. Unlike the original producer, Jason's ""new house"" waited three years to release its first sequel, studying scripts, bringing in Sean S. Cunningham (who directed the first) again to produce - they should have brought Steve Miner - and looking for fresh ideas for an already worn series. Having the killer attack young people in camps would no longer be fun; take it to new horizons, neither.Jay Huguely, Adam Marcus and Dean Lorey then decided to give ""new blood"" to Jason, practically reinventing the franchise, honoring horror fans and ignoring much of what was shown in previous films. Forget it: Jason never went to New York; Crystal Lake never changed its name to ""Forest Green"" - as the locals are proud of its illustrious killer; Tommy Jarvis never existed... It's much easier to accept the nonsense of Jason's Go to Hell script. The first of them: Pamela Voorhees also had a daughter: Diana Kimble (who changed her name to not be associated with the maniac). This in turn had a daughter, Jessica Kimble (Jason's niece), who also had a son. Inventing a sister for Jason is nothing more than honoring Halloween (yes, it is a tribute, like hundreds of others that happen in the movie).The plot begins boldly, with Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) falling into the trap of a police operation, who manages to shoot him and blast him to pieces, seemingly getting rid of Crystal Lake's killer once and for all. However, and I swear I'm not making this up, when taking his remains for an autopsy, his heart releases a demonic entity that will possess other bodies in order to continue its killing. The only way to kill him is at the hands of another member of the Voorhees family, who is discovered in the form of his lost niece Jessica (Kari Keegan).What the hell were these people thinking? I think it's kind of a pattern in the genre that the killer's supposed ""death movie"" is a big bomb, with Freddy Krueger suffering from the same affliction in Nightmare Hour 6: Freddy's Death. But what Jay Hugueley and Dean Lorey's script does here is just ridiculous, completely reinventing the concept of the character and throwing him into a supernatural premise that just doesn't fit with the previous chapters, and is too stupid to take seriously - or at least be a little afraid of it. Furthermore, this ends up taking us back to the same mistake as in A New Beginnings, in that we don't exactly have Jason Voorhees commenting on the murders; it's just laughable to see the characters ""possessed"" by Jason perform as they chase the protagonists, and the only good thing we get out of that are some very effective makeup effects.The idea of exploring a little more of the Voorhees family is one that could have borne good fruit, but here it doesn't get enough development, serving more as a Deus Ex Machina device. Most of the characters are completely disposable, and not even the fact that John D. LeMay's protagonist composes a profile never seen in the series before (that of a young father) is ever able to sympathize or win the public's affection. Only Steven Williams is able to generate any interest with his Creighton Duke, a ridiculous bounty hunter who amuses precisely because of this artificial factor.Here, fans question: why hasn't Jason gone after his sister before, in previous movies? The writers' explanation is simple: he wasn't because just now officially his body was completely destroyed. And he just needs her to be reborn, so there's no reason to look for her before... The only person who knows this secret is the bounty hunter, Creighton Duke, who claims to have searched the Voorhees family archives to find a way to kill Jason. The hunter spends the entire movie at the police station, only leaving in the final sequence, which is hard to really understand why. The script even makes the hunter curse the sheriff's daughter to be caged for the entire movie. All the action culminates in the Voorhees' house, where Jason does what he should have done the entire movie and inexplicably didn't: he enters Diana's corpse and is reborn. There follows a ridiculous fight with the hero, Steven, in which Jason simply throws the boy's body everywhere instead of breaking it like he always did. It's also hard to swallow the scene where he hits the guy with an iron instead of just sticking him in his stomach like he always did.This is certainly the most absurd proposal of the franchise to date and more out of the comfort zone, since this time the protagonists are not young people either, but some adults from the city of Crystal Lake - although there are some young people who show up only to be killed by Jason or the person he is possessing. And although in other films this works, here it has the totally opposite effect, as the script is too bad to develop this idea and ends up betting on other absurd details for the story. Speaking of other absurd story details, the plot brings a whole new and incohesive mythology to the franchise, involving magical daggers that can defeat Jason and even a Necronomicon, the Book of the Dead, which is a clear reference to The Evil Dead and which consequently spawned the Ash vs. Comic book series. Freddy vs. Jason.Responsible for directing, Adam Marcus does not stand out. With the exception of the great first scene, which starts with a woman running away from Jason before we have the notion that it's a police operation, nothing else stays in the memory. All of the murder scenes by Jason's ""avatars"" look like they're copied from George Romero's zombie movies, but with the difference that they're more comical than frightening. Just at the end, in a climax worthy of a Sam Raimi in his time of the first Death of the Devil, do we have something that manages to be quite visually creative, where the assassin is dragged to hell. And, of course, the famous easter egg where Freddy Krueger's claw pulled Jason's mask, finally starting the process that would culminate in Freddy vs Jason.Overall, the main criticisms of the script include the idea that Jason ""possessing"" people's bodies to kill their victims is something very strange and that the film is just another stereotyped sequel of the series, with poor acting and script holes. In addition, the film suffered a very large amount of editing cuts, so that almost half of the original material shot by Adam Marcus (film director) was not used, given the large amount of mistakes he made in his first work. As a director. Some dialogue was much longer and several scenes were considered unfeasible, such as an uninterrupted eight-minute slow-motion sequence (!!) during the restaurant massacre. In the process, many plots were completely ignored, while others were added and important scenes were compressed, such as when bounty hunter Creighton Duke explains ""the rules"" for getting Jason killed.Jason Goes to Hell is a huge heap of mistakes, misunderstandings and situations that must be forgotten forever. It will forever be the biggest blemish on the franchise, establishing itself as the worst Friday the 13th. This ninth chapter is an atrocity. The producers clearly tried to expand the Jason Voorhees mythology and try something new, but it's that old scenario of a frighteningly misguided and pointless decision being a real disservice to the character and the franchise. It only goes for the easter egg with Freddy Krueger, nothing else.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

It's definitely the worst film in the series, if we even can consider it belongs to the series, because as other(s) user said here in IMDb ""it's not a Friday movie"". I mean, it's completely lost of its mystic or any logical connexion! The movie itself is bad, but it gets even worse if we think it was meant to be connected to the Friday THE 13TH series, and to be the last episode! Thank God it wasn't, otherwise it would be a terrible ending to the series! Another thing that annoyed me and I thought it was completely stupid and out of any sense, are the similarities this film has to other horror (and action) movies which have nothing to do with it. This (ridiculous) alien look-a-like creature JASON became looked so much with ALIEN; one of the characters who incarnated JASON (and some action scenes) looks so much with TERMINATOR; the house which belonged to JASON family incredibly looks like the AMYTIVILLE house; and finally in the end the glove of FREDDY KRUEGER gets the JASON mask (was FREDDY vs JASON projected since then?)...

94,Ben_Cheshire,Guess where Jason doesn't go in this movie?,3,15 August 2015,"They had one job. Well, he sort of goes. One character says ""go to hell"" to him at one point. They missed a better title in my opinion: Jason Is Dead. Pretty catchy huh? You're welcome America. So, if you read the title as Jason dying they sort of pay that off. The Jason character supposedly dies in the beginning of the movie, and even gets a gross-out autopsy. Problem is, turns out he has some black goo in his heart which must have been causing all those issues he'd been having earlier, what with murdering folks and such. This black goo is basically used to completely rewrite the Jason origin story, throwing out all of the psychological motives he and his mother might have had, and basically turning him into a bloodborne disease, a Voorhees Zombie Virus if you will, except here there's only ever one Jason, and it just sort of jumps between hosts willy-nilly. Okay, so the Friday the 13th movies have never been great, and they've never been quite as ridiculous and funny as the Elm Street movies, but the audacity of what they attempt here really takes the cake: completely disregarding every bit of lore ever established on the character and pretending he can just morph about like some kind of sci-fi virus. So there's that issue. Then, of course, the acting and dialogue is garbage, there's not really any good kills to recommend, and the whole thing is just one of the most pathetic things I've ever seen. Not one of the worst of all time, probably, I've seen worse, which is why I give it a 3/10. There's some amusement to be had in the total incongruity with the other movies, and its enjoyable enough for your horror buff like myself who will watch absolutely anything in the genre. Others should stay away, miles away.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

They ignore the 8 previous entries and give their own take on the masked killer. I didn't dig the new approach too much. I'm supposed to believe that Jason has been body hopping the for 8 films come on! Aside that it's a blatant rip off of ""The Hidden"", this film just doesn't give us enough Jason for my liking The characters are mostly involving, (loved The Duke) and the acting is fine but the story is kind of cheap and very ""New Line"". We get the ""Voorhees"" house, we get Jason having a sister, we get a Jason baby (a lot like the Freddy baby in Nightmare 5)and we get a big cheesy slam-bang lightshow at the end that would be more appropriate for the Elm Street series than the Friday's. I have a theory: once a horror villain gets a sibling or a son/daughter tossed in, that means the entry is lazy.This film plunges head first into the supernatural and I don't think that's the way to go when it comes to Jason.

96,Darkside-Reviewer,"""I'll take a Voorhees burger and a side of Jason fingers""",6,9 November 2020,"Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday was released into theatre's in 1993 four years after the previous entry (Friday the 13th part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan) which was the final Friday the 13th movie to be released by Paramount. The rights to the series were eventually sold and bought by New Line Cinema after a lengthy dispute over the series rights between New Line Cinema and Paramount studios that ended on the agreement that New Line Cinema would own the rights to the series on the condition that they couldn't use the Friday the 13th name which led to this movie being named Jason Goes to Hell!.The four year gap between Jason Takes Manhattan and Jason Goes to Hell was originally the longest gap between Jason movies until the later eight year gap between the movies Jason Goes to Hell and (Jason X) which was released in 2001.Jason Goes to Hell is a very different kind of Jason movie while the previous movies always focused more on the Jason Voorhees character stalking and killing every horny, pot smoking teenager he can find often in bloody and inventive ways. Jason Goes to Hell takes the series in a different direction with Jason being killed off within the first five minutes of the movie with his body being blown up leaving him quite literally in pieces at this point you can't help but think to yourself how is this a Jason movie if the title character dies in the first five minutes of the movie?. The story this time around has Jason become a kind of parasitic creature that takes over people's body's by transferring itself between body's via mouth to mouth transfer that kills the host body upon transference. The Jason parasite can only survive inside a person's body for limited amount of time before the body starts to weaken and degrade. The story involves Jason swapping between people's body's as he tries to find the only person who can revive him back to his original form the only way he can do that is by entering the body of another Voorhees. This movie introduces the idea of Jason having a sister and a neice who also has a daughter which would be his great neice which needless to say is just a ridiculous idea for a Jason movie.This is the one Jason movie that pretty much every fan agrees is the weirdest one by far some claim it's the worst movie in the entire Friday the 13th series but me personally I enjoyed it because it was at least something different for once. This movie has some great looking make up effects that make the body switching scene's look very gruesome with the dead hosts body melting and falling apart in slow and detailed shots that end on the body looking like a pile of mush and bones. The deaths in this movie are also pretty gory and detailed there's people being impaled, stabbed, heads crushed, faces punched in, shot, spines broken. Jason may not be on screen for very long but when he's in someone else's body he's still strong enough to crush someones head in aswell being able to kill people with a single punch to the face.There's one last thing to say about this movie and that's about the infamous ending to this movie that teased a Freddy Vs Jason movie which didn't get made until 2003 a full ten years after it was teased. This was the most talked about ending credit scene in slasher movie history for a long time so in a weird way Jason Goes to Hell left it's mark in slasher movie history.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

98,ctomvelu-1,Hidden Jason,6,15 February 2009,"More than one JASON film has borrowed from other movies. Think of the one where a telepathic girl battles Jason, which is right out of CARRIE. In JASON GOES TO HELL, the plot is straight out of THE HIDDEN and it also has overtones of various HALLOWEEN flicks (A Voorhees homestead plays a significant tole here). Jason has been ripped apart by massive gunfire at the beginning, and his shredded body parts are brought to a morgue. Jason is a supernatural entity, and the scriptwriter reinvents him as this grotesque slug (a direct copy of the slug from THE HIDDEN) that jumps from body to body. Most of the movie is taken up with various people, possessed by the slug, going on a killing spree. But what the Jason slug is really after is a surviving relative (sound familiar?) so he can be reborn as the Jason we all know and love. Plot logic is thrown completely out the window, but the killings are terrific and probably the goriest in the series. Some Jason fans feel this installment is not a true Jason movie, and I won't argue with them. They liken it to Part 5, which used a fake Jason. All I can say is they were both Paramount releases and some of the people who worked on previous Jason movies worked on this part. But I will agree it was just too much of an attempt to reinvent the Jason saga, which was completely unnecessary. The most interesting character is a black bounty hunter out to finish off Jason, but we never learn much about him and in the end, he proves no match for the hockey mask-wearing killer. Also, Jason turns out to be a media darling in this movie, which just doesn't sit right. The whole world should not know about Jason. It would spoil the fun.

99,LoneWolfAndCub,Could have been MUCH better......,3,26 May 2006,"Jason Goes to Hell could have been a bloody good way to end the series (before Jason X and Freddy Vs. Jason were made, that is). Instead, we get a very, very average (but entertaining none-of-the-less) send off. The opening is promising, but it eventually descends into the downright ludicrous.We start off with an FBI agent staying at Camp Crystal Lake. She gets attacked by Jason, runs for a bit and walks right into a trap. He then proceeds to get blown apart by the FBI. His remains get taken back to the coroner to get examined. Then, for some odd reason, the coroner decides to devour Jason's still pumping heart. We then proceed along a gory killing spree involving drugs, sex and outrageous twists until we get to the finale where, you guessed it, Jason goes to hell.This movie lacks a lot of things that the previous installments had. For one, a lot of things are thrown at the viewer all at once in such a short period of time. This tries to take the same track as Halloween did and add all these family ties with the killer, which was just not needed. This movie is only good for mindless B-movie entertainment. It does feature some great special effects and the score is just as creepy as always. This is only for hardcore Friday the 13th fans, if you want something half-decent, just get Friday the 13th parts 1-4.1½/5.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

If you are a fan of the Friday the 13th Series, then you might want to give this a look just so you can call yourself a true fan, but otherwise I'd recommend watching something that you'll more likely enjoy.Well, if by some chance you do end up seeing this film, I hope you enjoy it.

101,raypdaley182,Worst Jason film ever?,1,20 January 2007,"Actually it gets a zero.The film has no place in being. the very start seemed contrived, when the FBI guys started shooting at Jason I thought they were going to show this was a movie being shot at crystal lake, thats how unrealistic the whole thing looked. the missile was typical American overkill.I want to start by saying this. Jason died as a child, he drowned at crystal lake camp, his mother did all the killings in the original movie, Jason never became an adult. ANY Jason film after the original is pointless as he is dead. Plot derailed.right, back to this pile of garbage. the coroner had no reason or motive to eat the heart, he was a logical man with a medical background. so we've already derailed the plot again, that's twice. once he's inhabited by Jason he has no motive to kill either of the security guys (they have no idea he's Jason).how does Jason know where his corpse has been taken and how would he know where crystal lake is from that location? (plot derailed twice more, that makes 4).did ANYONE notice the huge glaring continuity mistake when Jason takes over the sheriff? he's strapped to a table with at least 8-10 thick heavy straps restraining him. the coroner didn't set him free so Jason was left trapped. again, the plot derailed for the 5th time.the rest of the film is sheer garbage, only a vorhees woman can kill Jason.

102,asda-man,Cheeky under-rated fun!,6,24 June 2012,"I was expecting ""Jason Goes To Hell"" to be as absolutely terrible as ""Freddy's Dead"" due to all the poor reviews I've heard (although I did find Freddy's Dead really, really entertaining) but technically, this instalment is less laughable than Freddy's Dead (could be a good thing, or a bad thing depending on how you look at it) and it seems to break away from the somewhat tedious clichés the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise has seemed to live with its entire life-span. OK nothing makes sense, but at the end of the day its a Jason Voorhees film, so so what if its completely loony!Interestingly, the film opens up in an unpredictable fashion. The series thinks that it has its followers wrapped around its little fingers so that you think you know what's going to happen, but it actually goes an entirely different root. Now I can imagine that this would upset fans because it means that we hardly get to see Kane Hodder play Jason because he possesses other people for the entire film. However, one of these people becomes the policeman from ""Bean"" so that's fine by me. I also think that it gives some interesting scenarios with characters thinking that they know who someone is, when the don't.Of course some absurd death scenes do occur, which are all marvellously entertaining as ever, and with some interesting ways of getting the message across that unprotected sex is bad! As the film progresses it becomes more and more absurd, however it does have much more of a clear narrative drive than Freddy's Dead and the characters are people who you end up caring for more. There are also some fantastic practical effects, notably when one of Jason's possessed bodies begins to melt and the finale ends up being quite an exciting battle, with a very satisfying ending.Howver, what I don't get is why there are a couple of really random horror film references just thrown in there such as the book of the dead from ""The Evil Dead"" and Freddy Krueger randomly popping up! They make no sense because there's been no references to these before. But whatever, whats a few more absurdities thrown in going to do? Jason Goes To Hell is a fun entry to the franchise that attempts to break away from those tired Crystal Lake clichés and it does so in a typically entertaining fashion.

After going into her the Bounty hunter tells them that he doesn't have to be reborn through a living Vorhees woman.And so Jason is in his same body again and while fighting Steve Jessica impales the dagger into Jason sending him into hell.And has Jessica and Steve and their little daughter walk off Freddy Kruger's hand comes out the ground and pulls Jason's mask into the ground, this inspired the Freddy Vs Jason idea.Although Jason is not in it much the idea of telling us what makes Jason immortal and how to kill him was quite good. 10/10",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

A lot of people gave this movie bad reviews because it was so different, but come on, lighten up. The Friday the 13th series would be boring if it was always the same story. This movie was just different than the others, it seemed much more ""alive"". The characters were quite remember-able. The story was interesting (flawed as it was, but still good). Creighton Duke was my favorite character, I think he needed more screen time. This movie does not take after Part VIII. In fact, it acts as if Part VIII never happened (Part VIII had a fairly lousy, dead-end ending but this didn't take after that). Jason looked great in this movie, the kills were new and good.

That's right...He's done. Oh, but wait! His soul begins to pass from body to body, and he continues his violent killing spree in this manner. Oh, I know it sounds stupid but in reality its...No, you're right. It's stupid.This movie tries to give Jason so much back story that it can't even handle it. We've got the inclusion of Jason's half sister (I'm guessing a rip off of Halloween), and the fact that Jason is immortal because of some device from the Evil Dead series. It turns out that the only way to really kill Jason is to stab him with a magical dagger that only works in the hands of another Voorhees. Apparently that doesn't even work due to Jason X and Freddy Vs. Jason as well as the upcoming sequel. Oh, and the only way he can take back his original body is through a Voorhees. This causes some problems.The characters in this movie are all retarded. They all seem like they're there for comic relief. There's not one serious role in the whole film. The addition of all the mythical b.s. takes all the accountability out of the series...Or whatever accountability was left. There were two parts of this movie I liked. One was the opening. This film opens like a classic Friday the 13th and gives you some hope that it will be okay. Then of course, Jason is blown to bits, just like the movie's plot. The other scene I liked was the end where Jason's mask is lying in the sand after he's been sent to hell, so Freddy Krueger reaches up to grab it. This of course led to 2003's Freddy Vs. Jason.

He's been macheted in the face, hung from a barn, chopped into little pieces and drowned multiple times, but he just keeps on going.Well actually it's got nothing to do with his mother's death, or multiple drownings, it's all about the snake and eating hearts and is thoroughly disgusting, on top of being nonsensical.Bring in the FBI, a weird guy who knows more about Jason than the makers of the first eight movies combined with a liking to breaking people's fingers while giving them advice and you have a pretty ordinary movie.Contains nudity and sex scenes and the story is rubbish.

The good news is that this film is a lot better than all the previous films, which were all formulaic hack-&-slash. It has been made with a significant amount of imagination. Thanks for the interest in serial killers generated by ""The Silence of the Lambs"", the film treats Jason as another (albeit supernatural) serial killer.

113,squeezebox,Not exactly what I was hoping for,4,28 January 2003,"This somewhat disappointing ""final"" entry in the series starts out great, then settles into the usual slasher clichés for most of the movie's remainder. Jason is blown to smithereens in the first ten minutes, and his remains are brought to the morgue. For some reason, the coroner eats Jason's heart and becomes possessed by the killer's spirit and goes on a murderous rampage. Jason starts taking over different people's bodies to do his dirty work, until finally a Jason hunter shows up and promises to take care him once and for all, regardless of who he's inhabiting. Some decent gore effects (a girl is bisected vertically while having sex in the movie's highlight) and some amusing in-jokes (an appearance by ""The Book of the Dead"" from The Evil Dead, the line ""You get the mask, the machete, the whole damn thing"" a la JAWS) might maintain rabid fans' interest, but overall this is as routine as any other slasher flick. It's also a little annoying to have Jason himself in the movie so briefly, especially since this is supposedly his swan song.

114,Rendanlovell,Utterly bizarre,2,25 July 2020,"What a nightmare. At times hilariously over the top but mostly a slog. This is the first film that New Line Cinema produced after buying the rights off of Paramount and boy did they start with a bang. By bang I mean a complete Dumpster Fire.The most interesting part about this is the behind the scenes. Which featured Sean S. Cunningham (the orginals director) telling the director of this that it sucked to his face. The whole behind the scenes is crazy considering that New Line had only recently acquired this. You would think they would be carefully managing this project to ensure it was in safe hands, but they didn't. Apparently the editor of the film was the only one watching dailies for it. Which lead to New Line having to reshoot half the film because so much footage was unusable.With that in mind, it's actually something of a miracle this is even remotely watchable. It's dreadful, of course, but it's a surprise it isn't the worst movie of all time. At the very least I understood what was happening. Jason wants to be reborn or something and there's a bounty hunter that somehow knows how to kill him. So it's a classic race against the clock story.There is very little that's legit good here, but I enjoyed that this turns Jason into an even more paranormal threat by giving him the ability to possess people. Yes I realize this is very stupid, but in a franchise that features a telekinetic girl, this is the least upsetting part of the film. Seeing Jason walking around in other peoples body is rather lame though, I wanna see Jason murder people! I also can't help but feel like this possessor idea is far too close to The Thing. There's moments that are straight up just The Thing.The biggest crime this commits, much like part 8, is that it's terribly boring. There is so little at stake in this and so little to the characters that it's hard to sit through. Normally in this series everything takes a back seat to the kills. The problem here is that there really aren't kills until way late in this. Then the ones we do get are either laughable or awkward.It's mostly a mismash of poorly written characters doing underwritten things. The idea of introducing siblings of Jason is really stupid and apparently now they are the only ones that can kill Jason? What about Tommy Jarvis? He killed Jason twice. Did you forget about him? Also, why is the Evil Dead Necronomicon in this?Jason Takes Manhattan may be the worst movie I've ever seen and Part 5 is utterly stupid, but this ain't far behind. It's a little more competent and engaging then those two thanks to the absolutely wacky premise. It's executed so poorly that half the time it's hilarious and the other half of the time it's boring. I don't know what to think really.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
115,raisleygordon,Decent Sequel With No Actual Jason and Very Few Killings,6,12 September 2010,"On a technical level, this is somewhat a disappointment in the blood and gore department. But as a piece of storytelling, it holds up. I don't understand why the killings are so few and far between, and why the filmmakers felt the need to add a baby into the mix, and why Jason isn't technically doing the murders. He's there in spirit, but it's not the same. Actually, the majority of the killings happen in the diner, when everyone is killing one another. If crazy guy Creighton Duke must eat Jason's heart, fine. But do we have to watch it? It's unnecessary to see, not to mention gross. I know Jason is supposed to be stopped once and for all, but the final moments in the Vorhees home are far-fetched.

118,Tromafreak,The beginning of the end,4,1 June 2014,"The 90's was an awkward time for the Horror genre. The first few years, especially. Attempts at originality had about the same effect on the audience as uncalled for sequels to 80's franchises that had already ran their course. For one reason or another, the Horror genre had once again fallen dormant. But there was one Horror masterpiece that would come out of the 90's which would transcend the decade, as well as breath new life into the genre. Jason Goes To Hell is not that movie!While technically, this film is Friday The 13th part IX, officially, the series was over due to copyright issues. This as the beginning of a new series. Even in the 90's, Jason must live on. Original creator Sean Cunningham returns to give us F-13 fans something a little different. And why not? It's a new decade. The way of the 80's slasher is old and tired. Everyone knew that in 1993. So, something different is definitely in order. But this? Come on! Really?Last time we saw our hero, Jason Voorhees was in Manhattan, practically killing anyone he could get his hands on. Does anyone know how long ago that was? Or what he's been up to since? And most importantly, why he's still alive? No? Well, so far, it feels like a genuine Friday the 13th movie. And besides, these minor details don't matter much since Jason just got blown up by the F.B.I. And we're not even 10 minutes in! No. This is no typical F-13. This time, they're thinking outside the box. And maybe that would be a good thing if they hadn't just blown up the only reason anyone wanted to see this abomination in the first place.So, yeah. Jason's dead for realz, this time. As his remains get examined in the morgue, something strange is happening to the examining doctor. Something evil, which can be seen in his face. What we are now seeing is one more example of the fact that our hero, Jason Voorhees can never be stopped. Even after death, even after getting blown to pieces, he still keeps coming back. But without a body of his own, he has willed his own soul into the body of this doctor. You can tell because he just took a big bite out of Jason's heart, which made sparkly stuff (Jason's soul) invade his body. So, Jason's back. Just in another form. Clever, right?Something we never knew about Jason. When necessary, he can simply make his soul jump from body to body. So, he never really dies. 9 movies and somehow, this is just now becoming clear? Well, whatever. There is a catch. Even if nobody kills him again, he only has a limited amount of time in each body. So, he's gonna do his killing and spare a few here and there so, he can transfer his sparkly soul into new bodies. Eventually, the origin of Jason's alleged immortality is explained, which leads to more plot holes than ever. These movies actually made some sense before now. But no longer. Jason has a sister, a niece and a great niece, and for him to finally be resurrected as a guy wearing a hockey mask, he must make one of their bodies his own. Hopefully, someone can get a hold of the Voorhees dagger. Because apparently, stabbing him with that is the one and only thing that will send Jason to Hell and keep him there. But of course it has to be someone who is related to him. Something tells me all those F- 13 fans who wanted something different are feeling pretty silly right about now.But not quite as silly as the person who's idea it was to add this new take on Jason. Not a bad idea. Just not for an already established series such as this. It just doesn't make sense on a completely different level than anything from past entries. And not to mention this weird new take only allowed about 10 minutes of screen time for Kane Hodder. That's what really killed this one. in my opinion. Maybe such major changes would have been a little easier digested had they been allowed to call it ""Friday The 13th Part IX: Jason Goe To Hell"". It really is a shame they couldn't have. Would it have really mattered in the end? Doubtful. This one just wasn't meant to be. Jason Goes To Hell may have meant to breath new life into this series. But ultimately, it sent Friday The 13th straight to hell. 4/10",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
119,ReelCheese,"This Is Not A ""Friday"" Film",4,12 August 2007,"If longtime fans of the ""Friday the 13th"" saga have anything to say about it, the people behind this film will burn in the same place as its hockey-masked star. ""Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday"" is completely preposterous, out of place and an affront to what had been a dependable horror series.Admittedly, director and co-writer Adam Marcus deserves credit for his boldness. He seemed inexplicably convinced that the wheel of the ""Friday"" series needed to be drastically reinvented, even though fans had lined up for basically the same plot eight times prior. But the brainwave of having Jason possessing one body after another alters the very fabric of what made these films good. Suddenly it's like we're watching an ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" rip-off. Throw in Jason's newfound grunting, a far-too-heavy plot and a magical dagger (!) and you have something completely unworthy of the ""Friday"" moniker.""Jason goes to Hell"" is also incredibly lazy. All ""Friday"" films, by their very nature, require a leap of faith, but this is really too much. Firstly, this marked the first time that no explanation was given for Mr. Voorhees' reemergence. Were we all dreaming when we watched him get melted down to goo in the sewers of New York City? And what about Jason's rebirth toward the end (the most ridiculous moment of any ""Friday"" film)? How can a little slimy demon be reborn into a man already wearing ripped clothing and a hockey mask? And what about bounty hunter Creighton Duke? It's never explained how he knows so much about Jason and the mythical circumstances surrounding his life. In each of these instances, there seemingly are no easy answers. So rather than be inventive, the writers just threw all of this at us and hoped we would lap it up like thirsty kittens at a milk dish. This sequel completely ignores the continuity of the Jason legend that had been meticulously built up over the years.What's equally tragic about ""Jason goes to Hell"" is its insistence on mocking the series. At one point, John D. LeMay's character sarcastically asks a trio of teens headed for Camp Crystal Lake whether they plan to smoke dope, engage in premarital sex and then get slaughtered. Har har. The transformation of Jason into some kind of media star is just as unnerving. Jason is a legend, a mythical figure whispered about in wildly imaginative campfire stories. Yet this movie turns him into a serial killer so well known he makes the TV tabloids and is targeted by the FBI. This is not the Jason we know, and ""Jason goes to Hell"" is not the ""Friday the 13th"" we love. It essentially breaks the fingers of the hand that feeds it.The failure of ""Jason goes to Hell,"" both in terms of concept and box office revenue, inevitably draws comparisons to the much-panned ""Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning."" That film drew plenty of boos for its Jason-less gimmick, but at least it had the feel of a ""Friday"" flick. ""Jason goes to Hell"" is substantially worse than any other entry, mainly because it is completely unrecognizable. Like ""Part V,"" it probably would have worked better as a horror film independent of the Jason saga, rather than dragging Mr. Voorhees into a place he has no business being.Clearly, Adam Marcus was wrong. The ""Friday the 13th"" wheel did not need reinventing. The failure of this film (and ""Jason X"" years later) shows that fans want a return to simpler times when horny teens in cabins were afraid to look out their windows.

His goal is to be reborn through his last surviving family members. Now it's a race to find and protect the mother and daughter. Something about this film just feels... icky and wrong.

121,Toronto85,Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday,3,18 March 2011,"Jason Goes to Hell is the ninth Friday film, and by far the weakest to this point. The first ten minutes with Jason chasing the girl through the woods was classic Friday the 13th. Then the FBI blows him up and it all goes downhill from there. Jason heart manages to stay intact following the ambush. At the coroner's office, the heart somehow summons a coroner to eat it, which turns him into ""Jason"". Oh it gets worse. ""Jason"" aka random coroner, kills a few teens and then spits out some sort of lizard demon into another guy's mouth - turning the next person into Jason. This goes on and on until you actually forget and stop caring who Jason is at certain points of the film.The special effects are good, got to give them that. But there are so many plot holes it is ridiculous. And quite frankly, I don't like the story or the direction this sequel takes the franchise. We went from a backwoods maniac killing a few teenagers to having Jason's heart/soul possess random townsfolk into killing people. It's like a terrible version of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers'. I mean when you'd rather see Jason back in New York City instead of this, there's a problem. And there's also some guy named Duke who knows everything about Jason. He knows the whole story before it even happens. He goes on and on about Jason being reborn and how only a Voorhees family member can kill Jason. That leads to the back story involving some sort of a sister of Jason's. I don't know, it didn't make a ton of sense. Giving Jason relatives that die in the first thirty minutes adds nothing. Jason's origin isn't explained well in this sequel, and that doesn't bother me. I don't need to know that stuff. Jason was a young boy who drowned at camp. His mother blamed the horny counsellors who weren't paying attention so she killed a bunch of counsellors. End of story. Now they add a sister or half sister that we've never heard or seen of. Pointless.The best part of the movie (other than the first ten minutes) was the end where Jason's mask gets sucked down to hell by Freddy Krueger. It of course leads on to the Freddy v.s Jason movie made eleven years after this one. I can't believe I thought Jason Takes Manhattan was crap. That was a masterpiece compared to this sequel. I do like the restaurant owner who see's a baby at the counter and asks ""what the f*ck is that? Get it the f*ck out of here"".

Nothing on earth has been able to eliminate Jason, who goes on killing people pointlessly, as though he hasn't had his revenge for decades together, even after killing almost everyone who even set foot on camp crystal lake.The police have come out with a new idea. They set a trap for Jason, into which he falls, and then they ravage him with bullets and even bombard him with explosives to ensure he is destroyed. Unfortunately the heart survives, and starting with the Autopsy doctor, Jason now starts to possess people and carry on his grotesque activities, killing everyone on his path and especially killing those involved in illicit sex.The only way to kill Jason is by ensuring he dies at the hand of his only 2 relatives on earth. And Jason goes on a murder spree to find these relatives, so that he remains invincible. The rest of the story shows whether or not his relatives, guided by a bounty hunter, are able to eliminate him or not forever.Like my title says, the film is all gore and sex.

The story is unoriginal and copies everything from other horror films. The having a relative part comes straight from the Halloween series. The writer and director also copied from the science fiction horror film The Hidden by using a parasite (in this case Jason's heart) to control normal people and have them commit Jason's horrific acts of violence. The characters were also stupid. The only part of this movie that had any real interest was the ending. Of course I will not give that little secret away. Then again, it's probably not much of a secret now anyhow.There's not much else to say. I have seen all of the Friday the 13th sequels as well as the original,(mostly on cable's movie channels).

125,RhapsodyReviews,Hate This Movie.,1,7 October 2019,"Review:
'Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday' is an American slasher film directed by Adam Marcus. It is the ninth installment in the 'Friday the 13th' series. I hate this movie, I really do. There is nothing about this movie that is likeable or redeemable. It doesn't resemble a 'Friday the 13th' movie in anyway, other than Jason being in the beginning of the film. The acting is back to being awful and the story is so stupid you get bored of watching it in the first 15 minutes.
The film begins with Voorhees's body being detonated by the FBI and, after his spirit possesses the coroner examining his remains, he uses the coroner's body to continue his killings.
Also, the last time we saw Jason he was in Manhattan and he was somehow turned back into a kid, in this movie he is again a walking corpse. I can live with that, but then he gets blown up, they made it look so easy, they should have done that from the start. Now though it gets strange as Jason becomes something from those body snatcher movies.
Over, this is going to be a quick review because this movie isn't even worth discussing in length and it makes me angry. I don't recommend this to anybody.

126,DustinRahksi,Revisited review.,3,19 November 2012,"I learnt that this was the goriest in the series and was drawn in. You think there would be a lot of good kills, well there is but there's only one that stood out, and it is one of the most brutal. The only scene I enjoyed was the part was after the two kids have sex, Jason impales the girl on top of the man and rips her in half vertically, blood sprays every where. That was a moment where you go ""oooh"" thats awesome. Other notable gore moments include a body graphically melting, a wrist getting snapped in half, and a jaw being pushed into a skull. Now it is time for rant-town, this shouldn't take long. I like it when the lead actress finds out her mother is dead, she cries for two seconds and is back to being happy, it didn't even effect her. Then for some reason the book from The Evil Dead is in the Voorhees home, what was the deal with that. Duke also acts pretty outrageous for no apparent reason, one of his quotes talks about a little girl with a doughnut and a hot dog, who wrote this, you'll laugh because it was shocking, even the guy that hears it in the film is puzzled. There is also a severe lack of Jason in this outing, and I like how he is born with a hockey mask on. There is a pointless male shaving scene that feels out of Jason's character, it doesn't serve any purpose either. The movie was bad, the acting is horrible, the characters are garbage, the film is boring, and the plot is ridiculous. Some may say that about all of the entry's, but each of those films had their strengths, this one is severely lacking in those strengths. But I'll still watch it every time I get in the Friday the 13th mood. Skip this part, trust me it isn't consistent will part 8, it doesn't have the enjoyability of the previous entry's. The ending with Freddy's glove was a neat idea though.I don't recommend this one, but if you want to see all of the films you should give it a watch. It may be the worst of the series.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
127,FKDZ,Better than expected.,5,23 October 2020,"Compared to the previous films this one finally varies a bit with its story. It has a tiny segment of teens going to Crystal lake but it's more of a nod to the previous films and the film is not about camping or crystal lake really. This movie has a much more well rounded story, even though it goes a bit far at times I don't think this movie did more ''bizarre'' stuff than previous ones did with Jason's origin/magical powers.The kills were pretty tame but there are some really good ones I won't spoil. That said the movie is less gory EXCEPT for one particular memorable scene in the Voorhees house. There's also one really good jump and I can't remember actually being jumpscared like that in previous films.The soundtrack felt lacking overall, in addition this movie, at least when i saw it had all the dialog really quiet and the jumpscares loud as hell. Which was annoying because it was already hard to understand the dialog to begin with.That said, the franchise has had better finales, this one is alright but not as interesting and sometimes a bit frustrating.

Probably not. This becomes the ninth installment in the subversively popular, but consistently underwhelming Friday the 13th franchise. This is probably one of the worst of the series, which I kind of feel I say about each successive installment, for more than a few reasons the most overwhelming of which is that it is yet another Jason movie without Jason for the most part. Part V really faltered, in my estimation, because while it had someone running around in a hockey mask it wound up not being Jason. This takes a similar, yet no less inane stance by having Jason present, but instead of his typical form he is inhabiting other peoples bodies after he is ""killed"" in an opening scene. After a franchise low box office mark for part VIII this installment didn't fare much better becoming the second worse performing in the series. It continues to shock me how they can fumble what should ostensibly be a simple formula.This actually has an interesting opening as we follow a young woman alone at an isolated cabin and has plenty of typical horror movie moments due to the editing where the killer would come popping out, but they don't do it. Eventually Jason does attack and it is revealed that the woman is a ploy to lure Jason into a trap set by police/SWAT/FBI whoever and they blow him to bits. It is odd that we get acknowledgment of his existence from the authorities especially at the outset. The typical story has his existence shrouded in legend/mystery and only when it is too late do the wayward characters realize he is a very real threat. From that slightly intriguing opening introduction however this quickly goes off the rails. As a medical examiner is inspecting Jason he eats heart and all of a sudden Jason now has the supernatural ability to bounce from one person to another essentially inhabiting them able to kill with reckless abandon still seemingly from beyond the grave. Jason continues to do this for a purpose getting closer and closer to some goal which we come to find out is eventually finding a member of his family bloodline to inhabit which somehow thanks to movie magic will allow him to be reborn in Jason form. Let us take a moment here to marvel at the incredibly lunatic character of Creighton Duke, played by Steve Williams, who is somehow the bounty hunter extraordinaire who has all this knowledge, but it is never revealed where he comes by all this arcane lore. It is as bizarre as it is ridiculous. Then we come to find out how Jason is jumping bodies comes in the form of a little demon spawn critter. What the what? Like my previous comment as bizarre as it is ridiculous. This is an overall uninspired snoozefest.Once again those that put together Friday the 13th movies can't seem to hone in on the simple premise that put this series on the map. Instead they go for a convoluted mythology that no one cares about. There is nothing redeeming in the characters or the script or even the slasher gore which is what we are actually tuning in to see. This continues to be a slow death and desiccation for one of the most enduring franchises of all time. About the only purpose this serves is unintentionally humorous at how bad it is. It is nice to see actress Erin Gray, most notable from her Buck Rogers days, but the rest of the actors along with the script and action in this movie are utter garbage. I am surprised after this incredibly trashy outing they ever managed to put forth any more movies, but of course they did much to our collective dismay.Eric's Grade: F.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
129,Condemned-Soul,"Forget about Jason, the writers send the audience to hell in this awful ""sequel""",2,7 April 2020,"It would have been better to have repeated the series' tired formula than depart it as woefully as it does in this inexcusably bad 9th entry. If the previous film sunk the series to a new low, then 'Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday' finds an oceanic trench to sink even lower.With a story that is as illogical as it is painfully inept, Jason Voorhees is blown up in the first 10 minutes with his remains sent to a morgue. His heart miraculously starts beating, the spirit of Jason possesses the coroner who then chomps the heart, thus becoming Jason in human form. He then seeks out other victims to possess, killing those he crosses who don't meet his standards... And that's just the first act.The supernatural elements are terribly handled, and the hockey mask wearing villain is removed almost entirely as a physical character. If the writers tried to create the worst film in the franchise, they succeeded; if they had wanted to make one of the worst horror films of all time, they sure as hell produced a worthy contender.2/10",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

I can understand why ""Friday the 13th"" fans disliked the series' ninth chapter so much. It's not the worst of the bunch, but much of it doesn't even feel like a ""Friday"" flick. Granted, after so many sequels, it was inevitable that some liberties would be taken with the source material. Indeed, Part 8 did just that with its cruise ship/New York City setting, but what ""Jason Goes to Hell"" does with the mythos is a bit much. Granted, I've never been a big fan of the series, but even then I find it questionable to redefine Jason's character so much. He started out as a deformed murderer. Then he became a zombie. Now he's a parasite that jumps from host to host? That's a ""ret-con"" if there ever was one, as there is no precedent for this in the previous entries as far as I can ascertain. They just pulled it out of nowhere.Even then, I could accept it if it was dealt with convincingly. Alas, no explanation is offered for this revelation. What is this thing? Where did it come from? Is it an alien? A mutant? A demon from hell? What? I realize that you normally shouldn't expect a good explanation from any movie starring Jason, but when the parameters of a series change so drastically, so does my criteria for evaluating the films. Even some hints would have been much welcome.In terms of plot structure, it's uneven at best. After an interesting beginning with Jason's demise, it just goes through the motions, only picking up in the fairly entertaining final half hour. Until then, there's not a whole lot to speak of, and the attempts at human drama don't really work.Steven Williams is actually quite good as an opportunistic bounty hunter, but the character isn't well-defined, and how he knows so much about Jason remains a mystery. In fact, many of his scenes reek of contrivance. The remainder of the cast performs adequately, however. First-time director Adam Marcus gives it his best shot, but his work is ham-handed and a bit clumsy. The extreme gore, at least in the unrated version, gets to be a bit much at times. At least he tried. Overall, it's just a routine action/horror movie, under the ""bad-but-watchable"" category. However, there are scenes where an infant is put in jeopardy, serving little function except to empathize the film's overall excess and lack of taste. But that's to be expected when you see Jason, right?*1/2 (out of ****)Released by New Line Cinema",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

133,boyinflares,At least it has some redeeming qualities,6,23 January 2006,"The Ninth ""Friday the 13th"" film is certainly one of the worst. But that said, it is not without its redeeming qualities. However the fact that Sean S. Cunningham was involved, might make you expect more than the final result.Aside from ""Friday the 13th VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan"", part 9 is the first film to take Jason out of his element, but at least part 8 followed the same premise as the earlier films. Part 9 took the dangerous path of giving the unstoppable killer more back story than was needed. (Along the lines of ""Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Meyers"", though it wasn't nearly as bad as that). In addition to the back story (which is revealed he has a sister), Jason, or at least according to the film his physical body, is destroyed, however, his evil heart enables his spirit to go into the bodies of other people, enabling him to carry out his mission.This time, his ""mission"" isn't to kill any pesky teens that end up at Camp Crystal Lake, but to get to one of his relatives so he can be reborn (in his body that we are all familiar with). Complicated? Just a bit. Along the way, ""Jason"" encounters various people, most of whom are not teens, which moves away from his usual sort of opponents, something that isn't too good.Another mark against Part 9 is that not only is the heroine without a doubt the most awful Friday the 13th heroine, but the hero is just as bad. No offense to Kari Keegan and John D. LeMay who play the aforementioned leads, Jessica (Jason's niece) and Steven, but of all the most boring and bland Friday the 13th characters, these two take the cake and eat it too.With the exception of Steven Williams who plays the annoying bounty hunter Creighton Duke, the rest of the lead cast are pretty good. Steven Culp, always a pleasure, is great as ratings-hungry media man Robert Campbell. Erin Gray is terrific as Jason's sister, Diana Kimble, though it's a shame she meets her maker so soon in the film. Rusty Schwimmer is a scream as Joey B the diner lady and Allison Smith is underused as Vicki. Michael Silver makes his film debut as Luke, the only male-eye candy in the entire film.So while ""Jason goes to Hell"" is an important film in the Friday the 13th mythos, it is complicated, filled with continuity goofs and features the two most boring leads ever. Otherwise, it's an okay film though you may want to watch it with some caution.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
134,chucknorrisfacts,"The final Friday? Yeah, right....",3,21 October 2007,"Much like ""Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter"", this film by its title promises to be the last in the series, and yet it isn't. In fact, two more movies featuring Jason Voorhees were released after this, ""Jason X"" and ""Freddy versus Jason"" respectively. It was however the first film in the series not to incorporate ""Friday the 13th"" into its title and was the last ""Friday"" film for eight years.This movie isn't very good, putting it simply. It is the third lowest grossing film of the series, and you really don't get to see Jason all that much. He hops around from body to body in some supernatural turn not seen in any of the previous films. The only reason to see this film is for its ending, which if you haven't seen it I'd recommend skipping over this next part.After Jason has been defeated you see Freddy Krueger's clawed glove pull Jason's hockey mask to Hell. It is unclear whether this was originally intended as a setup for the eventual ""Freddy versus Jason"" or if this was just sort of an in-joke horror fans could appreciate.For a film that features the tagline, ""The creator of the first returns to bring you the last"" it sure doesn't live up to the hype.

135,Zombified_660,"Confusing and somewhat disappointing, but still fun in a silly way...",5,30 April 2005,"Jason Goes to Hell is probably the most experimental of the Jason movies. This is to be applauded, but unfortunately the experiment is something of a failure. This movie tries to explain the Jason mythos, but actually eschews any of the mythos the earlier movies had created in favour of its own take, which is frankly rubbish anyway.The movie explains Jason's invulnerability as 'he can only die if he's stabbed through the heart by a family member with this special knife'. If this was so, then how come Tommy Jarvis kills him at the end of number four and he doesn't come back until number six when he gets struck by lightning Frankenstein style? I shouldn't really expect solid gold continuity out of the eighth sequel out of 10 (with an eleventh heading our way sometime next year or the year after) but I do expect some kind of respect for the storyline laid down in previous sequels and this isn't it.However, if I were to ignore the wholesale jettison of the plot of the rest of the series, maybe JGtH would still be good? Well no, it still kinda sucks eggs. They decided to jettison Jason as well, see he gets blown up with a bazooka in the opening frames and spends the rest of the movie as a worm hopping bodies in a soulless mockery of The Hidden. He comes back for a bit at the end (and is enough of a bad mofo in this last five minutes to almost make up for it) but honestly, doesn't do a lot other than bash Steve Williams about a bit. Mind you, this sequence is pretty fun and almost redeems the movie.So, there's a dumb plot with no connection to earlier Fridays, Jason isn't really in it...Hell, you ask, is there even any gore? Any reason I shouldn't skip straight from Eight to Ten? Well, on the gore front the movie delivers. It has what the team themselves refer to as 'the most horrific kill in a Friday the 13th to date' which is, I'd have to confer, pretty damn nasty (I won't spoil it, just to say it is absolutely sick, and involves a tent spike), and if you're watching the uncut edition (buy this in the UK or on import from the UK on Pathe and you will have the uncut print) there's a whole damn lot of nastiness, including a deep fat frying, a lot of fairly hideous slashing and a man melting into a pool of gore Robocop style. If you want blood, you got it basically and to be honest hardcore gorehounds probably won't give two hoots about it's shortcomings on account of all the generous splatter on offer.But I watch horror movies for the excitement factor and the removal of the iconic Jason leaves this movie choking in the dust when compared to other Friday movies. If this movie had Jason in place of all the people he bodysnatches it would have been awesome, but he's not and he carries these movies. A shame, as the movie's still pretty interesting (if only as a failed experiment) due to the reasonably good ideas it has. It just lacks the X-factor of Jason.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
136,Minus_The_Beer,Invasion Of The Franchise Snatchers,6,23 August 2013,"The most divisive of the infamous ""Friday the 13th"" series, ""Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday"" was Jason Vorhees' first (and subsequently, only) venture into the '90s as well as New Line Cinema's first stab at the well-worn franchise. After eight films that more or less played on the same concept -- killer stalks naked teens in woods -- the franchise was in desperate need of fresh blood and fresh ideas.Enter Adam Marcus, newbie director and buddy of the original film's director's son. Through either luck or some form of nepotism, the young film-maker was handed the reigns to the iconic franchise, whether he was ready or not. With screenwriter and friend Dean Lorey in tow, the supposed final entry in the franchise finds everybody's favorite unhappy camper being blown to bits in the first ten minutes. Is Jason finally dead? Not quite. Now he's taken to hopping bodies and faster than you can say ""Was that the boogeyman?"" he's hunting down the offspring of his sister in an effort to ensure his bloodline lives on, ala ""Halloween II"" (and just about every other ""Halloween"" sequel thereafter).""Jason Goes To Hell"" is without question the most ambitious of the ""Friday"" flicks that precede it, and for that it deserves kudos. Marcus and Lorey may have been well over their heads in tackling such a massive franchise, but their zeal and love of the genre bleeds through in just about every scene. Sadly, the concepts they introduce to the franchise are rather heavy-handed and contrived. Borrowing elements from the aforementioned ""Halloween"" series and ""Invasion Of The Body Snatchers"" -- among others -- this sequel can't help but get bogged down with an abundance of recycled dead-end ideas that are coming completely out of left-field when you consider that this is the ninth entry in the series and we're only just now learning that Jason has a sister and that there is a magic dagger that can kill him and yes, there's a bounty hunter on his tail.Speaking of bounty hunter, Steven Williams plays the role of Creighton Duke with such enthusiasm that he single-handedly lifts the film out of mediocrity. This character alone makes the film worth watching and serves as the best adversary Jason has met since the days of Tommy Jarvis. Shame that the rest of the cast isn't quite up to task. John D. Lemay is decent as the nerdy ex-brother-in-law to Jason, but the rest of the cast is either given nothing to do or simply exist only to give the filmmakers' buddies something to do. This is, of course, mentioning nothing of the plot which gets the more ridiculous the longer it goes on.Granted, ""Jason Goes To Hell"" isn't quite as bad as its reputation. If nothing else, it's an entertaining and surprisingly fresh detour in a franchise that was admittedly getting stale by the time ""Friday The 13th: Jason Takes Manhattan"" washed ashore. With an abundance of gooey, gory effects (all about the cop melting before your very eyes) and pre-requisite nudity, ""The Final Friday"" pays more than enough fan-service while, at the very least, trying something new. Be sure to stick it through to the ending for a cameo from another well-known '80s slasher villain, giving way to the inevitable ""vs."" movie a decade down the line.Bottom line: When it comes to the ninth entry in a horror franchise, you could do much worse than ""Jason Goes To Hell.""",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

What makes this movie so terrible is that Kane Hodder's portrayal of Jason Voorhees is in the film for about 5 minutes. Did the makers of this film really think that Jason fans would care to see a Jason movie without Jason really being in it? Plus the opening credits in the film last for about 15 minutes! Irritating! Also, the soundtrack sounds like it came from a rejected Disney film. I would strongly recommend not watching this movie at all as it contains no memorable lines, scenes, or characters.

The 90's was a decade when we bread our children to be stupid and forget the past. It is a decade when we told our children just live for the now there will be consequences in the future, but there were. Because the generation I come from has been bred on stupidity we elected the dumbest man into office not once but freaking twice, come on people just because his last name is Bush does not mean he will support all your deviant sexual exploits. It is also because of this that we have forgotten where terror came from and this film was a last desperate gasp to show us that in turn failed. Hardly anyone remembers this film. As a child of the 90's I was reared on USA network and when they aired the classic eight Jason films I could not wait for this new final installment to the franchise. When I finally saw it, I was dismayed as Jason is almost not in the film and when the kills happen it is only to adults. Was this to say that maybe Jason's audience had matured and no longer wished to gaze upon the senseless demise of teens or was this to tell us that horror was dead and that a new generation would never understand the greatness that was the late 70's and all of the 80's blood cinema. All this film had going for it was the complete lack of respect for the MPAA (I say good they should be taught a lesson), and the fact that Freddy Krueger's gloved pop up at the end. This ending meant two things for me over my life time so far. First as a child it was hope that horror would return to it's heyday and we would see the mother of all blood battles. In my teen years and early adult hood this meaning changed when that follow up was realized. The new meaning was that Jason is dead. I love him and wish for him to continue on his journey, but with the likes of Micheal Bay, UPN, and THE WB and there is no hope for Jason. He is doomed to be a commercial entity that has been taken from the fans and thrown to a generation who could not and will not ever understand where he came from. And where he came from was the imagination of a few good men who were hungry and wanted to leave a legacy. They might not have thought Jason was it but with there determination he became it. I say to Sean S. Cunningham, get your soul back.

They totally messed up his whole origin/motive. Despite everything, it was an enjoyable watch though but when I rewatch the Friday the 13th movies I'll make sure to stop after the 7th film.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

149,andell,The Worst crime is the murder of a horror icon!,1,1 May 2005,"Let's understand two things about slasher horror from the 1980's: first of all, they had a legacy of saturating their own market, and secondly, they were simple stories born out of the twilight of an ever changing world.With this in mind, it would be easy to point out what is wrong with Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday- however for the sake of time, it might just as well be easier to point to what's right about it. The answer to that is: NOTHING! All you ever wanted to know about Jason is revealed, and once you know the dark secret, it will haunt you- except for a small matter of cosmetics, the ""dark secret"" is the same as the lemon revealed a short time earlier in New Line's bad ""finale"" to the Nightmare movies. Of course, the only nightmare about that film was having to admit that you paid to watch it- it is much the same with this piece of total garbage.Jason, it would seem, is not merely a specter capable of regeneration with a great rage at those who he feels are responsible for both his own and his mother's demise. Oh no, the dark secret is that if you can find someone who shares his father's blood line (cause lets face it, his mother was not born a Voorhees), then you can see Jason finally put to death, or you can see him re-born. Guess what happens here.Except the rebirth is anti-climatic because he is nothing more than the same twisted mass of flesh that he was before he was blown apart by bombs and bullets at the beginning of the movie. And apparently genetics has a preference for certain types of clothing, and a certain mask because he is reborn with both.In one laughable sequence, you would be forgiven for thinking ""Jason"" (or as I'd like to refer to him as...the Imposter) being reborn meant the world would end, however a mere 10 minutes or so after he was ""reborn,"" he is also summarily killed again with an ancient dagger (who were the camp counselors who ignored Jason as he died...some ancient Sumarian or Egyptian people or something? What's with the dagger that must be used? Why does it look like an artifact) supplied to his niece (oh, this is a long story, and is too tedious and boring to go through right now) who finds the Linda Hamilton in her to terminate the 'terminator.' You'll be in for your just desserts if you think this repulsive piece of junk is worth even five minutes of your time. Of course, there is plenty of blood and gore (as the Friday films always seem to have), and there is also plenty to gross you out- but if you think or feel anything towards the horror icon that made these films successful, you ought to take a pass on this one.Even the soundtrack is awful!",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

151,fibreoptic,The weakest link!,4,9 February 2004,"This movie just saddens me because it is a lamer of a film. A Jason movie with hardly any scenes with the man in the hockey mask in them! How bad is that?! And how does he get from being melted in the sewers of Manhattan (friday 13th Part 8) to being back at camp crystal lake with a rather nasty head infection?? and why the sudden need to make Jason look more like the hockey masked hero from the slaughter house video games rather than the usual looking Jason?? And if it was a setup at the beginning then why does the woman act so calm knowing that jason is in her cabin!? Would you (FBI agent or not) strip and have a bath knowing a psychopathic zombie maniac was lurking a few yards away and she must have knew he was there because that's why the S.W.A.T. team was in the forest unless they had been hanging there in full camouflage for weeks on end for their bold and brave female agent to meet Jason, run from Jason and actually manage to get to and find that particular spot in the forest! It's all just a bit too absurd even for a Jason movie. Paramount might have been embarrassed about the Jason franchise but they certainly did a better job than New Line in making them.Jason Goes To Hell does have some decent shocks in it though and a nice cameo by Kane Hodder (the man behind the Jason mask) as one of the S.W.A.T. team guys who is performing security checks outside of the morgue. The movie even pokes fun at itself in places and the ending is cool if not a bit in your face. Look out for the appearances of certain items took off other horror movies like the necronomicon from the evil dead movies.

In the opening scene a woman is running through the forest (sometimes she has bare feet, sometimes she has socks, sometimes she has shoes, you get the point). The baby changes throughout the film (sometimes it has a full head of hair, sometimes it looks bald). Then there are the plot problems.

Now we have some kind've sci-fi Hidden/invasion of the body Snatchers twist that just doesn't work at all.

Big part of why Jason is scary is because he's a silent killing machine, adding random grunts to him totally undermines the character.Oh and the intro credit scene is one of the most annoying things I have ever seen, because of the way it cuts back and forward what feels like a hundred times.One of the worst movies ever made.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
155,jiangliqings,"Possibly the best of the series (not that that says a whole lot, but the movie is a hell of a lot of fun).",10,13 October 2001,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** *** out of ****Well, it was inevitable.  The 80's had to come to an end, which of course, led us to the 90's.  It was around the turn of the decade that the slasher genre started to die out, and the only movies of the subgenre that were considered profitable were the ones attached to big-name series (i.e. Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, Child's Play, and Friday the 13th). The interesting thing about the 90's is its approach to the slasher.  After all, in the 80's, the filmmakers were usually reliant on blood, mood and atmosphere, and sex and nudity.  But that's in the past.  With the release of The Final Friday, it was quite simple to see how much the series (and subgenre) had changed.  This film still keeps the blood and the sex/nudity (which is actual more graphic than any of the other installments), but prefers all-out gory fun over atmosphere build-up.This film plays the whole thing in a semi-campy tone that often flirts with intentional self-parody.  After the failure of Part VIII, New Line Cinema picked up the rights to the series and ended it all with a bang (of course, with Jason X, the series is hardly over).  The Final Friday begins with a sexy woman driving over to the abandoned Camp Crystal Lake.  She enters one of the houses, prepares a bath, then strips, but then the lights go out in typical horror film fashion.  The person responsible for the power failure turns out to be none other than Jason Voorhees, the psychotic mad slasher wearing a hockey mask.  He looks bigger than usual, too.  He chases the woman out into the woods, which is a big mistake for him, because it's a trap the FBI set up, and they proceed to pump over a hundred rounds into him, and blow him into at least a dozen pieces.Everyone thinks Jason's reign of terror at Crystal Lake is over, but it's not.  A coroner examining his heart gets too close, and soon enough, we've got a body-hopping Jason who is now on a quest for rebirth and the only way he can do this is through a blood relative.  These relatives would be Diana Kimble, her daughter Jessica (Kari Keegan), and Jessica's own baby.  The only man who knows of this connection and knows how to kill Jason is Creighton Duke (Steven Williams), a bounty hunter who's willing to offer the information, for a price.  Anyway, Diana is eventually killed, and Steven (John D. Lemay), Jessica's old boyfriend (or husband, we're never really told) and her baby's father, is accused of her murder.  His jail cell is actually right beside the Duke's (who was arrested for reasons never stated), who tells him the secret of how to kill Jason Voorhees.  Steven manages to escape, and scrambles to protect Jessica and his baby from Jason.The Final Friday probably received the most mixed responses from series fans.  Many showed nothing but scorn towards the movie because it strayed away from series continuity while many others considered it the best of the series because it actually tried something different.  This different plot is a take of Jack Sholder's The Hidden, and director Adam Marcus plays it well into this movie.  While The Final Friday has a few messy moments in direction and features a mostly grating score from Harry Manfredini (which makes it a real disappointment since he was responsible for the original nerve-jangling score), this is perhaps the most fun film in the series, as well as the fastest-paced, most action-packed, and goriest.This time around, Jason isn't on his typical mission, which is to kill horny teens.  Though he really can't refrain himself from doing so to a couple in the middle of intercourse, which results in a body cut in half that is often considred the most memorable death scene of the series.  Anyway, the film mostly focuses on his attempts to gain back his old body, which can only be done so through another Voorhees.  Thus, one thing no critic can say about this film is that it reverts back to formula.Throughout the film's course, there's quite a bit of kick-ass action, which includes a police station and diner massacre, as well as a one-on-one showdown between Lemay and the big man Jason himself in the finale.  These moments are violent, fast-moving, and pretty exciting.  My favorite part of all these scenes must be when Lemay, who has just been arrested and has spotted Jason, leaps over his own handcuffs, knocks a cop aside, takes his gun, and proceeds to empty half the clip into Jason.  Having seen the unrated version, there's no doubt this is certainly the goriest film in the whole series (think of it this way, the first 3 parts combined won't match the amount of blood and guts this film has).  KNB did the make-up effects and they are impressively done.  Body parts fly, blood spurts and goes everywhere, and there's a heck of a lot of maiming going around in this film, with the highlight being the aforementioned diner massacre.  The movie has a huge bodycount, numbering around 26.None of this is played particularly seriously.  I mean, the film is certainly never frightening or the slightest bit scary for an instant (then again, most of the other series installments aren't either, as only The Final Chapter offers consistent scares, though The New Blood does get in some good chills.) but I doubt this was even a consideration on director Marcus' part.  Instead, the movie often opts for laughs.  It's all apparent from the opening FBI-staged attack.  Think about it, what better way to lure Jason out than for a good-looking woman to get naked?  It happened in a span of 8 films, so there sure wasn't any reason it wouldn't work now.  It makes for a funny opening joke and establishes a tone that is half-knowingly tongue-in-cheek.Some of the dialogue is fairly humorous, if not exactly subtle or necessarily clever.  I liked the Duke's response to what he thought of Jason Voorhees and I laughed during the scene where Steven picked up a group of young, good-looking hitchhickers going to Crystal Lake and tells them, ""So, you thinking of smoking some pot, having a little premarital sex, and getting slaughtered?"" Dialogue like that helps make this the second-funniest film in the series. The movie doesn't quite have as many laughs as Part VI, mainly because the Diner employees, who are certainly there to add campy humor, are more annoying than anything else, which is probably why I savor their massacre (well, maybe just the fat woman's).  It's also that same sequence we get to see Vicki, the waitress who shows as much bravado and fighting skill as Ash from the Evil Dead series, take on Jason in Sigourney Weaver style.  There are a couple of other fun moments horror buffs will definitely enjoy, such as when Steven finds a copy of the Necronomicon in the Voorhees house and a crate in the basement that is the same from the one in Creepshow.The acting is overall better than you would expect from a cast of mostly unknowns.  The only actor I've seen here from something else is Steven Williams as the bounty hunter Creighton Duke.  He has the best performance in the film, stealing many scenes with his cool attitude and smooth dialogue-delivery that's equally compelling and a lot of fun to watch. John D. Lemay is pretty good as Steven, the film's nerdy-looking hero.  He's quite likable and something must be said about the toughness of a guy who lasts for nearly 3 minutes in a one-on-one fight with Jason.  As the movie progressed, he also had his fingers broken and was thrown from a moving car. As for Kari Keegan, the film's heroine, she doesn't make much of an impression.  Her performance is pretty mediocre, but at least she isn't relegated to damsel-in-distress mode.  Kane Hodder still makes the best Jason, but it's not as if there's a lot to do in the role.Overall, this could be my favorite in the series.  As for the other contenders of that hardly prestigious title, The Final Chapter has the suspense and scares, Part VI: Jason Lives has the most laughs and the best acting, and Part VII: The New Blood features the best heroine and some good suspense.  Jason Goes to Hell is simply the most fun, displaying all the entertainment value I expected from an action/horror flick.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

This is a pretty big departure for our wayward, slightly faceless foe, as he tackles the living hell of shape-shifting through body's and eluding a bounty hunter that means business. The previous FT13 had polarized many longtime fans of the series with a weak script, several off-screen kills, and although the title suggests the J-man is ripping people to shreds in NY, the costly high-profile shooting locale proved too expensive steering the script away from the big apple, enter: Jason takes Canada! This is my favorite of the entire franchise, it's the most daring and artistic. In the beginning the homicidal hockey hiker is blown to pieces by a crack group of heavily armed cops, his body parts bagged and tagged sent off to the morgue. Sometime funnyman Richard Grant whose most known for playing the black cop in The Big Lebowski, checks in for coroner duty and quickly falls into a trance state consuming Jason's heart raw, presumably cold. For the rest of the movie Jason jumps in and out of body's in search of death and destruction. Along the way a camping love-couple gets RIPPED in half, faces get smashed, and CHUNKS of human tissue go all over the place in what seems like endless gun battles. John D. LeMay who was on a show in the eighties with the same title (way different premise) plays boyfriend to local waitress with Jason genes, and helps whoever he can survive the body count. The other great part goes to Steven Williams who plays the bounty hunter Creighton Duke (awesome name) out to kill Jason for good with the aid of a ten gallon hat and an intergalactic knife. The whole movie flies by at a spitfire pace with great camera work and shooting locations. Jason was never a careful cut and paste and bury and hide type of killer, he's a stalking unstoppable force that rolls over people like a tank and crushes their skulls till the eyes pop-out.

Seems they are working on a PART 10, so eventually, we'll see ""Friday the 13th Part 17... The Final Cut. NO REALLY, WE MEAN IT THIS TIME!""The opening sequence is the highlight of this film. A beautiful young woman wanders through the buildings of Camp Crystal Lake, gets naked, takes a shower, and then hears something. She soon discovers Jason out for a prowl (apparently back from holiday in New York...) and she leads him into an open area in the woods. Then the army shows up and blasts Jason to smithereens. Completely. We are talking doggie kibble here. SPOILER ALERT!!!!Then the movie tries to give us more than any of us wanted. It tries to explain that Jason wasn't REALLY Jason, it was just a demon that possesses bodies, alive or dead, and makes them kill (I guess that's how they tie in Mrs.Voorhees from the original and Roy Burns from part 5 into the legend... it was a possession. Yeah... right!) So, we get all kinds of ""Jasons"" here as the Jason demon jumps from person to person. The special effects are quite good, and there are a lot of other horror film references in either the dialogue, cinematography, or visuals. It's fun to look for the nods to ""Halloween"", ""Creepshow"", ""Alien"", ""The Evil Dead"" and many others. Other than that, it's a little insulting. Jason was a boy who drowned due to neglect. His mother took vengance, and upon her death, Jason rises from the dead (or his forest home, if you believe that he really DIDN'T drown in the first place) to avenge her death. That's all. There was no need to complicate things this late in the series by a storyline that is so preposterous.

Voorhees Need Voorhees To Be Reborn. more appropriate than the cult of thorn in the Halloween series. I think one thing people learned from the 80s slasher series is to have a lore in place from close to the beginning, so you can sports build up to it a bit if you're gonna throw it in there. this movie is just, ""whoop, there's lore"". but you need to give some kinda reason for killing him for good (shrug) I forget how he comes back in Jason x.also i love John D. Lemay. Friday the 13th the tv series is amazing and it's always nice to see his friendly face.this one is very polished. definitely seems like a Hollywood film. and lastly, I remember my friend telling me about the very very last scene.

163,nightwishouge,Wow.,3,12 April 2021,"About two years ago, I bought the Blu Ray box set of the original Paramount Friday the 13th releases (1-8) at the local Wal-Mart and gradually made my way through the series with my girlfriend. In retrospect $20 was the perfect amount of money to plunk down on the set--cheaper than the accompanying beer and pizza one needs to enjoy the films. I wouldn't say any of the movies are good, per se, but in the right frame of mind they are trashy fun.Would that the series had stopped there.Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday was not included in that box set, being the first episode in the franchise after New Line Cinema bought the rights (ostensibly for the opportunity to match their own slasher titan, Freddy Krueger, against the hockey-masked antihero). So I had to wait until it showed up on a streaming service to which I had access. Tonight was that night. Was the movie worth my own personal wait? Well, let's just say it made me nostalgic for even the worst of the Paramount entries.What's wrong with the movie? Where to begin? I'm not sure there's a single positive thing I can say about Jason Goes to Hell, except that it didn't strike me as out-and-out immoral. What a ringing endorsement.First of all, the concept is ill-conceived. Why make a Friday the 13th movie that barely features Jason? He IS the franchise. Sure, he's at his most effective when kept off-screen for a large portion of the movie, but to eliminate him altogether is to completely miss what fans love about Friday the 13th as a brand name. Instead the plot focuses on a vaguely defined ""evil"" jumping from body to body to accomplish what we are now told was Jason's mission all along: to eliminate the Voorhees bloodline, because only a Voorhees can kill a Voorhees...but also can reincarnate Jason's evil into a new body. Yes, the motivation of killing off his own family members IS stolen from the Halloween franchise, and yes, it's a dumb plotline there as well. Also, if Jason knew all along he needed to kill his own long-lost (or at least never-before-mentioned) sister, why was he spending so much time at Camp Crystal Lake offing teenagers arbitrarily? Just for kicks, I guess.In a way, I sympathize with screenwriters on long-running horror franchises. As a given series goes on, they have to continually inject the latest movie with enough innovation to justify its existence while still delivering what the fans have come to love and expect. Both Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street indulged in convoluted, nonsensical mythologies to carry the series along (though Nightmare at least did something interesting with it by part 7). So in that sense, kudos to Friday the 13th for wringing 8 more-or-less satisfying entries out of the exact same premise (tedious though it got by the time Jason took Manhattan) before invoking supernatural retconning. But back to Jason Goes to Hell specifically.The second problem: the cast. The characters fall into two categories: grotesque caricatures, for which there is certainly precedent within the franchise; and the completely nondescript. As usual the comic relief characters are not ACTUALLY funny but at least have a certain amount of energy. The main characters are so bland I can't tell you a single character trait shared among them. The leads are boring and have absolutely no chemistry and the supporting cast leave equally little impression. At one point a waitress in a diner grabs a shotgun and starts blasting away at the Jason-surrogate like Sarah Connor in the Terminator series and I found myself thinking, ""Do I have any idea who this character is?"" The only exception is mysterious Jason-hunter Duke, played by Steven Williams, who for unexplained reasons knows all about (and becomes the exposition for) all this new mythology about the Voorhees evil. His character doesn't come to anything either but at least he feels alive.The final nail in the proverbial coffin is Adam Marcus's direction. The movie doesn't look particularly good. The earliest films in the series have a low-budget grit and grain that, combined with the camp setting in the lush wilderness, winds up being at least accidentally aesthetic. Jason Goes to Hell, by contrast, is just polished enough to be completely lacking in atmosphere. The pacing is arbitrary at best, with tension failing to materialize and jump scares consistently falling flat. In terms of cinematography, Marcus barely outperforms a typical Goosebumps episode, especially in the opening sequence in which a heavily-armed FBI team takes down Jason; it's just so amateurish and flatly lit and goofy you feel like you're watching a movie-within-a-movie, a la a Zucker Brothers comedy or something. Jason himself is so bulky and mutated, with his lumpy bulging head threatening to swell over and envelop his hockey mask, that he looks like a rejected design for a Resident Evil antagonist.Lastly, I hate the tone of gratuitous fanboy wankery Marcus sets throughout the film. Fanboys think nothing is more clever or satisfying than pointless meta-commentary and empty references to other properties they like. When you give fanboys money to make art, they spend so much time and energy imagining how they can create little coded messages and ""winks"" for the other fanboys in the audience that apparently they forget to go a step further and create something decent and compelling in its own right. Watching a movie borne of such a mentality is akin to the torment of being cornered by an angry bearded guy with poor social skills who needs to blather at you in excruciating detail about why The Last Jedi MUST be omitted from canon. What a blot on the face of the Evil Dead franchise that the actual Necronomicon prop worms its way into this smug self-satisfied hack job.There is certainly a place in the world for bad movies. Mindless garbage, unambitious fun. What I can't abide is boring, self-congratulatory, inane, incompetent drivel. Even a diehard Friday fan ought to skip Jason Goes to Hell.

Those who say the remake was awful, have you seen Jason Goes to Hell?Good : There is an interesting character - Duke. He seems interesting a lot. He doesn't do anything significant to shine in the movie, he is just dumping expositions. But the actor makes it likable.Bad : Yet another whacked out Friday the 13th movie! This feels like a forced pile of garbage that is there just to set up Freddy vs. Jason. So far, there has been no mentioning of supernatural origins of Jason, not even hinted. Freddy's Dead is a garbage film. At least it has only mentioning about the tadpoles that powered him throughout the series. We know about his origins from the subsequent movies. Here, everything is done via exposition. Jason's bloodline plotline is just super crammed for not letting this movie die. I said the movie is whacked out, I definitely don't like this lame excuse of a movie. But it is entertaining in ""that"" way and only in ""that"" way. If we had some better characters in a better setting and in a fantasy franchise, I think the ideas for this movie could've worked. But it feels like a dispassionate job of a totally bored creative team. Jason possessing people is another weird thing that has never been explained at all. This movie is just a train wreck of weird ideas put on screen. The new elements do not make Jason more interesting. He is perhaps the most goofy and overrated villains of the horror genre. I won't say anything else. It's very boring talking about this movie.Conclusion : It is just a generic Disney witchcraft film which is a bit darker, a bit gory and features Jason. That's the perfect way to put it. As I like the fantasy witchcraft things, I enjoyed it a bit more than others. Else, it's nothing good.Rating.Score : 1.8/10Grade : F",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

From this setup, we think this is going to be another by-the-numbers Jason flick. But the movie soon takes a turn into something much more unique (though not completely original).Producer Sean Cunningham, director of the first movie, returns to effectively reboot the series. This is the first after the acquisition of the series from Paramount by New Line and is obviously trying to set up a ""Freddy vs. Jason"" movie, though that wouldn't happen until a decade later.This movie follows ne'er-do-well Steven as he tries to reconnect with his baby momma, Jessica, who has her own ties to Jason.

The only way that Jason can return is by gaining a new body, and he does this immediately, jumping from body to body, killing person after person, ruining life after life.The final death of Jason is here at long, long last, and, as unexpected, requires a visit to his old childhood home.I'll say, this is the only sequel in the entire series that is ACTUALLY scary.

170,talarisw,"Iconic hockey mask killer, Jason finally goes to hell in this ""final"" installment of the series.",2,14 July 2012,"What makes this movie sooo bad is not the story or acting, it's the fact that the film makers made absolutely no attempt to give fans a good explanation to why Jason couldn't die for eight movies. I'm a big fans of horror movies, but my problem with Jason is that his story always been a little too thin. I understand it's a slasher series but there's a lot of plot holes and it's very one dimensional. That's why my favorite is Freddy Kruger because he has a lot of depth. But when I saw this movie, many years ago,I was hoping they would explain Jason's immortality but they didn't. This film has nothing to do with the previous eight! It's completely out of nowhere. It's a shame because they came up with some interesting ideas but they could'eve tried to tie it in with the other films. Here's the plot, SPOILER ALERT... Jason is killed by the F.B.I in a trap set at camp crystal lake but a mysterious demonic looking creature from Jason's heart starts jumping into people's bodies possessing them with the soul of Jason Voohees, so he continues his murders. However a bounty hunter named Duke knows the truth, that Jason has a sister, Diana and she has a daughter, Jessica and that the creature who lives inside Jason's heart needs to posses a blood relative then he can became Jason again. The only way to kill him is with a dagger and only a Voohees can kill him and the introduction of the Voohees house. Now I admit that actually does sound interesting but the problem is the film does not elaborate on that plot anymore then I just did. Jason has a evil creature living in his heart, he has a sister and no attempt to tie it in with the previous films. Now it would be different if this film was a self-proclaimed stand alone but it's advertised as a final installment to the series, so I feel because of that the writers and director Adam Marcus should of gave us a story that connects with the continuity of the film series. The films continuity is that in 1958 a handy-capped boy named Jason Voohees drowns at Camp Crystal lake. His mom Pamela Voohees went nuts and started killing people at the camp but she was killed, then Jason somehow came back from the dead to kill in his mother's honor. This is the only film that reveals the name of Jason's father as Aliance, so I think a good story would'eve of been if Jason's father was a warlock/wizard and used black magic to bring his son back from the dead and un-killable to avenge his family.That would of made more sense then this erratic plot. But on the positive side the film has some good action/murder scenes, Jessica's boyfriend Josh is good as a likable hero and the great Steven Williams is great as the weird bounty hunter. Kane Hodder is also good returning as Jason Voohees. I like the music and visual look of the film. I always liked the title, ""Jason goes to hell"" has a good ring to it. I like the ending, seeing Hell actually come for Jason and then there's the cameo by Freddy Kruger & the evil dead book. And it always bother me that the film series is called Friday the 13th, but most of the movies have nothing to do with Friday the 13th!, like this one. The film had some interesting ideas for Jason but I can't help but feel like this film is a huge disappointment for anyone who wanted a REAL explanation to how Jason can really die.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
171,Kelly G.,Pretty cool.,7,17 April 1999,"Even though I liked this last entry (yeah, right) in the Friday the 13th series, a part of me can understand why others don't care for it. Since Jason technically only appears (at least in the form we are used to) twice, and spends the rest of the movie jumping from body to body, this might be seen as tampering a bit too much with a comfortable formula.Personally, I was so glad that I was seeing something new here, (although it's actually not all that new as anybody who has seen the fun cult, sci-fi/action flick ""The Hidden"" can attest to,) that I was willing to put aside a few minor quibbles. Like what, you say? Well, it would have been nice if the Creighton Duke character had been a little more heroic instead of being such a jerk. Also: Where in the Hell did the ""magic dagger"" come from.Still, there were a few scenes here that are pure gold.#1: The opening bit where Jason faces off with the SWAT team. I had always wondered why nobody ever tried that before. Big dude isn't so tough when faced with high powered weaponry, is he?#2: The scene with the coroner and Jason's heart. It's just so goofy watching him chow down on it like a Big Mac, I laugh everytime.#3: The slo-mo diner attack. The ""monster attacks the good guys who are trapped in a diner"" is a classic horror movie stand-by. I get a warm feeling everytime I see it.Oh, one more point a friend brought to my attention: The hero of the movie sure can do a god job punching people after Duke breaks his fingers!",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

But from what I've seen, it appears that the series doesn't try to actually scare people. This isn't a bad thing, but it also appears the creators are taking themselves seriously. This movie, like the others, is silly, ridiculous, over-the-top, and unintentionally funny. The only positive notes are two well-done gore scenes. Some of the gore is actually confusing, like how when Jason bashes two guys heads together, they look like they were burned and then melted into each other. What??

It is a grubby, cheap, dirty movie which makes my skin crawl and makes me want to take a good, long shower; but not in a good way that a horror film should. Everything about this sequel stinks. The terrible acting and the horrible, dull array of characters. The Jason formula is repeated over and over, and becomes completely bore-some. Jason who we thought was dead, becomes reborn in a coroner, and moves around from body to body until he finds a relative with Voorhess blood in them. Once he does, he can settle in their body. So basically Jason is missing from this mess of an instalment. The rhythmic, speedy, upbeat soundtrack is completely unnecessary and becomes repetitive and irritating. The death scenes are quite trimmed, yet inventive as was Debbie's demise, when she is impaled and halved with a tent spike. This was one of the very few redeeming qualities to this shameful flop. It's a grave shame that this addition is in the collective series, because it is clichéd, dull and has hardly any reasons for viewing it whatsoever.

I know Jason is barely in the movie, but this movie at least tried something different with the body hopping plot line. Yes it is very silly and makes no sense, but the body horror element is very well done. Creighton Duke was my favorite character. He supposedly was hunting Jason the whole time. Where you been bro??? We haven't seen you my guy. Thats why Creighton Duke and Reggie the Reckless need a team up movie. It would be epic. It could fill in a lot of the missing Creighton Duke story line. Sorry for the tangent.Jason dies and his spirit or heart or something jumps from person to person until he can be reborn or something like that. Jason's soul cant stay in the same body or something or the body will break down. It doesn't really add up. Thats the best synopsis I can give.Its a fun Friday night hang out movie.

179,bramb600,Absurd and Ludicrous,3,16 June 2009,"After the atrocious Part 8, you think that that would at least mean immediate improvement. It was highly unlikely that it was going to be as terrible as Manhattan but somehow they managed to make it even worse.Now the beginning is pretty exceptional considering that the movie is the polar opposite. We see our favorite antagonist, Jason Voorhees chasing down another victim with the perfect soundtrack and scenery all around for a Friday movie. But, they decided to ruin that perfect moment for us by a SWAT team showing up and shooting Jason to bits. But how is this possible? We need Jason to be around for there to even be a threat or have this even be a Friday movie. Simply, don't get confused because this is not a Friday movie.Parts of Jason's body are spread out on the table for the coroner. When the coroner comes in, he pretty much decides to eat Jason's heart out of the blue. There is simply no explanation why he does it or why anyone would do such a gross thing, but the fact that this was actually in the script was completely ludicrous and absurd. Everyone needs a reason to do something, the coroner's reason was to push the movie forward to the next scene which was really awfully done.Jason is now pretty much a demon that is possessing people's bodies. That destroys the whole scary Jason element because this movie is mostly just people killing each other constantly and that can get extremely boring.When we do see Jason at the beginning and the very end, it's truly the best look he's ever had because his hockey mask has become a part of his face. This is such a cool look for him, and the metal mask is pretty cool too, but since we hardly ever see it, the movie still sucks.As for kills there was only one that was really shocking and it involved a sex scene in a tent.

Then it's actually a trap by the F.B.I. whose been tracking Jason. Now, why hasn't the F.B.I. thought of this 15 years ago? Anyhow, Jason is killed in the first 15 minutes of the movie...then the movie takes a Sci-Fi/Fantasy turn, which is quite interesting. The movies tries to tell you more about Jason Vorhees background, but it fails on several attempts. Now horror film buffs will recognize the infamous 'Book of the Dead' from the ""Evil Dead"" movies. The movie doesn't talk about the book, but you realize that this is probably why Jason keeps coming back & back. The original director Sean Cunningham comes back as a producer to this movie is a nice touch, even though this is nothing like the original. Jason's spirit enters body after body to get where he needs. He's on the rampage in a city & gets to get his victims in different locations besides the camp grounds. This is what part 8 should have been like. But, the ending is just weird & a tad stupid. It's a shame because the movie keeps you watching with it's great special effects.

I watched this with my family and we laughed our asses off, especially at the diner scene near the end. How does this diner have so many weapons?! Where are the weapons coming from? Wat?!This is the one Friday the 13th movie that I think is actually bad. While some may argue that the formula grew tired and cliche, at least each one tried to change things up a bit while still feeling like a Friday the 13th movie. This one just felt so out of left field to me. And not in a particularly fun way, like the next movie, Jason X. Jason X had the brutal kills and Jason was more visible than ever. That movie may have strayed away from the formula by a lot, but it still felt like a cheesy, fun Friday the 13th movie. Even the Jason-less Part 5 still felt like a Friday movie.

Which I think was a great idea, because they explored JASON to a different state of mind. Writers Dean Lorey & Jay Huguely and director Adam Marcus took the series in a different new look.JASON(Kane Hodder) somehow is out of New York and is back at Camp Crystal Lake, only to tracked down and killed by the F.B.I.. This is where the fun starts, JASON heart beats an evil tone and forces a doctor to eat it, gross I know. Now JASON is transporting into people's bodies. The only way for him to be reborn is a family member, that means Jessica(Kari Keegan) or her baby. And the only person who has the weapon to stop him is the Duke(Steven Williams), with the help of her ex Steven(John D. LeMay). Will they make it in time to save the day.This has to be one of the top 10 goriest films of all time, see the unrated version. The deaths are over the top yet fit right for this particular flick. This to me should have been called JASON goes wild, because of the harsh punishments he gives people in this. All the acting is great, especially the bodies JASON jumps into. But Steven Williams stole the whole movie with his excellent one liners and top notch deliverance for all his scenes. The only thing that hurts this movie is it's lack to explain itself for most of it's scenes. For example, ""How did JASON come from New York to here?, What is the real reason for JASON evilness?"", although the last one was answered, just not the way you would expect it to be and not clean it up enough.

185,poyrazbaklan,A body-hopping Jason? Really?,2,6 January 2013,"The last chapter(but not really)in the Jason franchise, this movie is the shameful child of the series that fans do not talk about much. Like the kid that is sent to his room to hide when guests come over. How hard is it to screw up a Friday the 13th movie? You just watch it for the grisly murders of young people and mindless scares, but the director lacked the irony when he decided to exclude Jason out of all this. Really, our hockey-mask donning villain appears in the first five and the last ten minutes of the movie. Why, you ask? Because of his body swapping skills, of course. Due to him being killed in an FBI operation early in the movie, he lacks a body now. But all this time we didn't know (and I mean eight movies) that if his heart survives he can just hop into another body and live on! So the movie suddenly becomes more of a zombie movie where he just dons people as suits and murders anyone on his way. It is now up to our laughably inept heroes to save the day, since Jason can only be sent to Hell by another Voorhees. Although the cross-over references with Evil dead and Freddy are clever, the rest of the movie is in shambles, bad acting, forceful comedic scenes and not enough scares aside, the plot holes with the body- swapping theme is off the roof. In one scene we see Jason in one body just going all brutish on people then in another he is clever enough to disguise himself as a deputy and trick people with it.

The problem with this is that people want to see Jason in the movie, otherwise we would have virtually no reason to watch these films.

Friday 8 tried to be simple and different all at the same time and that really hurt the film. Maybe that's why I hate it the most. Jason goes to Hell takes that ""different"" path and steroids it. I guess maybe New Line were either scared no one would want to see the same old thing or thought that all the aspects they brought up would seem ""cool"".*** Spoilers***The plot of this movie is polar opposite to the basic Stock Teens introduced, Jason is around, They all die. That's what I was hoping for with this entry..only this time Jason somehow goes to hell. This time around Jason is somehow still alive (dispite melting into a pile of sludge from Friday 8) and still lives in the woods of Crystal Lake. The movie starts of old school with some random chick going to some random cabin and doing typical random things (like walking in the dark and getting naked almost instantly)...I had a good vibe coming from all this. THEN the chick reveals her self to be an FBI agent and lures Jason to his ""Just Desserts"". Heres where the movie shifts into Bulls*** mode. It seems Jason's heart still has his soul and if you eat the heart Jason can possess you and make you kill. One unfortunate dude does just that (WHA???)and starts the killing spree. Just don't expect all the teenage traits in the house.No this time the characters are mostly residents of the town ""Crystal Lake"". The actors are surprisingly credible and likable, but i don't want these types in a Friday Flick I'd rather see them in a actually ""scary"" horror flick. Some other bad script choices are Jason now has a Sister and a Niece (HALLOWEEN anyone?), Jason has a house/ mansion (A Nightmare on elm street Anyone?) and Jason can body hop whenever he wants to (THE HIDDEN anyone?). None of these are appealing, especially for Jason. What's going on here? Also Jason's physical appearance is really absent. I DON'T WANT TO SEE JASON AS A BLACK DUDE!...no I'm not racist but seeing Jason as a Black dude or some Newscaster sucks big time. Even when Jason does look like his old self, the make up is to over the top and fake looking. Some good things about this flick are it's GORE and DEATHS. I laughed out loud so many times when a lot of these mooks died (bashed in mouth!!!) and the humour is nice too. This also looks like one of the best Friday Films out there...as Halloween 6 and Nightmare 4, this is definitely the MTV Jason. Nice Direction!!!The Duke was also a good character with a good actor. There's also a blast from the past when Jason dispatches 3 unlucky campers (FUN STUFF!) and the pace is super fast.It's just too bad the screenplay and producers are trying to be too out there with there choices.

A week later Diana Kimble, a waitress at Joey B's Diner in Crystal Lake, watches ""American Casefile's"" report on the disappearance of Jason's body and the coroner and the death of the coroner's assistant and two FBI agents. AC host Robert Campbell offers famed bounty hunter Creighton Duke $500,000 to kill Jason if he is, as Duke claims, still alive. Meanwhile, the Diner is celebrating Jason's ""death."" Diana comes face-to-face with Duke, who asks for her help and tells her he knows who she ""really is."" Diana's boyfriend, Sheriff Landis, has Duke taken out to his cruiser.That night, Steven picks up three hitchhikers and takes them into Crystal Lake to ""have a little premarital sex, smoke a little dope."" When he leaves the three, the redheaded girl is sliced up with a scalpel and the other two are split open with a spike. The Coroner returns to the diner and kills Edna, who is having an affair with Josh. He takes Josh back to the Voorhees house, where he transfers the evil heart into the deputy.Diana talks to her daughter Jessica, who is now dating American Casefile's Robert Campbell. They are interrupted by the now-possessed Josh, who attacks Diana. When she sees Jason's reflection in the mirror, she shoots him in the head. But Josh doesn't stay down, and Steven comes in to find Josh and Diana struggling. When he separates them Josh accidentally hits Diana with a knife-sharpening pole in the back. Steven runs Josh through with a fireplace poker and pushes him out the window. The sheriff arrives to find Diana dead on the floor. Steven protests his innocence but when he looks out the window Josh is gone. Steven is taken to a holding cell.Jessica arrives at the station to take care of business, and Steven sees her - and their baby daughter - while he's being moved. In the cell, Creighton Duke gives Steven the information he needs to know - Diana was Jason's sister, and he needs a blood relative to be reborn in his own body. With Diana dead, his only remaining family members are Jessica and her daughter Stephanie. To protect them, Steven breaks out of jail. He goes to the Voorhees house, where he hears Robert Campbell outlining his plans to spice up American Casefile's Jason coverage with his theft of Diana's body. But Josh bursts in and transfers the heart into Robert. Josh's body melts away and Robert leaves.Steven catches up with Robert at Jessica's house and runs him over. Jessica doesn't believe Steven's explanation and throws him out of the car. She runs into the police station and deputy Randy is sent to retrieve Steven. Meanwhile, Robert begins a massacre at the police station. Steven and Randy arrive as Robert tries to transfer the heart into Jessica. Steven steals Randy's gun and shoots Robert in the head. Jessica and Steven head to the diner with Robert in hot pursuit. Stephanie is gone but there's a note which Jessica doesn't tell Steven about. When she takes off, Steven sees the note and arms himself with a machete from the wall.At the Voorhees house, Creighton Duke waits with Stephanie. He tells Jessica only she can kill Jason and gives her a knife and warns Jessica that Jason could have jumped into anyone. . . but he falls into the cellar just as the Sheriff arrives, quickly followed by Randy. The Sheriff lunges and impales himself on the knife. Then Randy grabs Stephanie and tries to transfer the heart - but Steven runs in and slams the machete into his neck. Jason's mutated heart, now a Hellbaby, escapes through the neck wound and climbs down into the cellar, where it finds Diana's corpse.Now reborn, Jason bursts up from the cellar. Duke is bear hugged to death while trying to protect Steven and Jessica. Steven gets thrashed by Jason while Jessica tries to retrieve Duke's knife from the cellar. . . who will survive to send Jason to Hell? A Great Sequel compared to part 7 and part 8 but it would have been best to lay the series to rest here.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
192,Was-it-All-a-Dream,Jason Goes to Hell (1993),2,30 April 2009,"This film is a disaster. In almost every single sense of the word. The biggest question is, where does the blame lie? I think the answer is: New Line Cinema. A studio whose bread and butter was its' Nightmare on Elm Street series. Friday the 13th was owned and operated by Paramount Pictures, a studio who always had a problem with the films. Also one of the only studios who know how to look a gift-horse in the mouth, which Friday the 13th clearly was, and always made them a lot of money. They were hot to sell the film rights off apparently, after the release of the eighth film (which I personally found to be the best) and New Line bought 'em. But just to show how much they hated the series, they kept the original films' video rights and continued making untold mountains of cash on the VHS purchases and rentals. As far as New Line was concerned, they'd killed Freddy Krueger off in 91's Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare. So it would seem they wanted to see what they could do with ""Jason."" And right in the title (practically identical to 91's final Freddy-go 'round), they tell you he will be sent to Hell by the end of the movie.Now, I don't mean to be overly cynical, but I have to say- if where Jason ended up is Hell, it sounds a lot more attractive than where this movie took place over the 90 minutes it took to send Jason there. This is one of the shoddiest and ugliest looking horror films I've ever seen. I can't imagine the budget being smaller than Paramount's Friday the 13th Parts VI, VII, and VIII, since New Line always increased the budget of each new Nightmare on Elm Street film. Nor do I know the budget is really the problem with this movie. But what remains dated and unfashionable about, for example, Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan, still looks a whole lot better than what was new and modern about Jason Goes to Hell. The style shift from Paramount to New Line resulted in less technical sheen and slickness, and more... what I can only describe as ""cheapness."" This feels much more like a bad TV show. Or, to be more specific, the TV series that actually did spin-off from Paramount's film series. And it affects every single detail of the film. From the music score, to special effects, to writing- everything in Hell comes off as cheap and flimsy.And this is surprising, when one watches interviews with the director, who is a very likable and interesting, down to Earth guy. He's a true fan of the original film series. Or so he claims. Because the moment he received directorial reigns, he changed everything about the series' format to the point where nothing is recognizably Friday the 13th about the film (which I know lots of people who don't like the films wouldn't mind). Even more frustratingly, New Line never had the presence of mind to get a filmmaker to change it back. Instead in 2009, the Friday format has changed yet again, only so that now it resembles New Line's current incarnation of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Things haven't been right with the Friday the 13th series since New Line got their hands on it. Or, I should say- the ""Jason"" series, since New Line can't put ""Friday the 13th"" on one of their films unless Paramount is co-producing it. Which they are now (those people have absolutely no shame, do they?). Though, all this has caused me to hypothesize that perhaps Friday the 13th is a glory of the 80's. And should lay dead with the 80's.Since Jason Goes to Hell is a product of the 90's, let's see what the 90's did to ""Jason."" First, the reason I have to add quotations with any mention of the famous 80's slasher is because he is almost non-existent in this film. Yes, the film called ""Jason Goes to Hell"" is almost completely Jason-free. Jason Voorhees became a body-snatching entity who bounces from host to host (think: Wes Craven's Shocker), draining them of their lifeforce in order to search out his sister so he can kill her (Halloween II), then setting his sights on her daughter and her little baby (Halloween 4, or Halloween: Curse of Michael Myers, which probably ripped this off 2 years later), so he can impregnate one of them (an incestuous Rosemary's Baby) and burst out of their body (Alien) as Kane Hodder's full-bodied and grown Jason. Who looks like crap due to a new design that seems to suggest his face is being squished-in by his trademark hockey mask and that the flesh on the sides of his head has to squeeze out from the edges of the mask, like raw hamburger flattened underneath a coaster.That's all bad enough. But to add further insult to injury, director Adam Marcus injects the film with a cross between Evil Dead II schlock and generic exploitation / crime film sexual crudeness. Enter: Creighton Duke, the foul-mouthed bounty hunter (Part IV's Rob Dier mixed with a little of Firestarter's John Rainbird)- an entirely loathsome, nasty, despicable jerk who is one of the movie's many unnecessary sources of unsuccessful intentional humor. It bloats (in more ways than one) into full horror-comedy mode, but completely lacks the true charm and ingenuity of Peter Jackson's best (Dead Alive, Bad Taste). Instead, it's just a more hyper version of something like The Terminator, with admittedly quite good splatter and gore effects (watch the Unrated Director's Cut to see it all) - pretty much the film's only redeeming quality. That and a very silly fight sequence (that, unlike a similar scene in John Carpenter's 1988 turkey, They Live, doesn't stop the movie dead in its' tracks) between a pair of friends. One the main protagonist, the other an adorable police deputy (think Dewey from 1996's Scream).",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
193,Krush_Burner,The final (and bitter) entry of a classic Jason Voorhees,7,4 December 2014,"Well, ""The Final Friday"" is not your typical ""Friday The 13th"" movie, and this is the first thing one should know when one's going to watch it. This part finishes the classic franchise (which lasted for 8 films in 9 years, from 1980 until 1989), and not in a good way, to be honest. But let's try to go by the numbers to make it little bit more clear. The first thing I'd like to say, is that TFF really gives us the whole explanation of Jason Voorhees's phenomenon – for good or for bad. If you're a fan of the series, you need to see it just no know how the whole story ends. Then, second thing worth mention, is that TFF is not much of a slasher, it looks more like supernatural mystic horror movie. It is completely not in line with any other parts of the series, and to make such film as a conclusion of a Camp Crystal Lake's saga is at least bizarre decision (actually Jason is on screen only for a several minutes for the whole movie). However, it has its moments: there is some suspense, nudity, gore and lots of killing – but in all-new context, which is, to be honest, not working pretty good. I would like to recommend this one only for die-hard ""Friday The 13th"" fans for research reasons.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
194,ecmelton-186-105049,A Hell of a Good Time,8,3 December 2015,"Jason Goes to Hell the Final Friday, is in my opinion is the one of the best and most overlooked installment in the franchise. It's the ninth film and if you follow the plot lines throughout the series you will notice that there appears to be a constant attempt on the part of the writers and studio to one-up the previous films and make ever more outlandish plots. By this point Jason had been killed, resurrected (both by Tommy Jarvis,) he fought a woman with tele- and pyrokinesis, and even went on a rampage in New York City, all spawning from a film he didn't even appear in. The studios desperation (or whatever motivated the writers) created this gem. In it Jason's antics have become national news making him one of America's most wanted.Also Early in the film a bounty hunter is introduced who may be one of my favorite film characters. His personality could be described as having a very strong sense ""deadpan Wimsey"" meaning he still is a very serious character but delivers some lines and does some things that are hilarious and outlandish. During the new interview (where he first is shown) he is asked what the name Jason Voorhees means to him. His response was the eccentric, ""It makes me think of a little girl in a pink dress sticking a hot dog through a doughnut."" This attitude is maintained throughout and ads character to the film that most slasher flicks severely lack. The other characters are okay there's a love triangle featuring the male and female protagonist as well a sleazy TV presenter who wants to exploit Jason's story by any means. Its nice that they had a more mature cast as opposed to the teen camping theme the other films had.The movie is surprising because Jason only appears (Physically) at the beginning of the movie. Within the first 15 minutes he is blown to bits by a swat team grenade. Jason live on however. When is body (parts) are delivered to the morgue the coroner become mesmerized by Jason's heart which begins to beat when he picks it up, so naturally the coroner ate it. In eating Jason's heart he become possessed by Jason's soul. Jason spends the rest of the film jumping from one persons body to the next. He does this by crawling (in the form of an evil crab slug thing) out of one person's mouth and into the next victim. Later it is revealed that Jason can be ""reborn"" by entering the body a female, blood relative. Not much more can be told about the plot without ruining the story. As a whole the move makes a good attempt at being a real horror movie and not just a slasher film. If you don't like cheesy horror movies this probably won't win you over, but for a bad slasher flick it's not half bad.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
195,insomniac-rod,A decent end for Jason... but not Friday the 13 th style,7,31 July 2001,"----spoiler----""The creator of the first returns to bring you the last"" , after watching the trailer, and that line, I was so excited about watching the movie. I've been a fan of the movies since I was a little boy. After watching the movie's first 10 minutes I thought : this movie returns to it's roots, it has all the Friday the 13th  elements : a dumb girl, no reason for nudity, dark settings, and Jason being scary.  I was impressed by the scene where the SWAT team shoot and throw a grenade blowing Jason in millions of pieces. I thought again : this movie will rock!!! But sadly, after the opening credits the movie was no more Friday the 13th. There's only one part of old Friday the 13th style, the scene where the campers get killed by the possessed Coroner. The movie is not scary, it has lots of dialogue scenes, and the acting is good overall.The movie has good direction, some settings are dark, beautiful and creepy at the same time. It was nice to have John D. Le May (Steven) as the lead actor, 'cause he's part of the Friday the 13th series, and he is a well known character. Kari Keegan's (Jessica) performance is ok, and she's cute too, but the character that I enjoyed the most was Steven Williamson (Creighton Duke) he had great lines, and convinced as the mercenary that wanted to end with Jason, his role was important.  Kane Hodder as Jason is always cool, he gives Jason a personality. I was disappointed with the plot, c'mon! if the movie's title is ""Jason Goes To Hell"", Jason should do the killings looking as Jason! the hockey masked murderer. Anyways, the movie's end will please die hard Friday fans.I'd say that this is a good movie if you are a fan of the movies , ONLY if you are a fan.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
196,moz-1,High point of an otherwise dull series.,7,2 March 2001,"Lets get this straight; I'm a Nightmare On Elm Street man, I always will be. Personally, I don't even think the first Friday deserves any merit.  So I was unsurprised with the routine opening to this movie.  The single white female, the lake-side cabin, the pointless nudity.  The only redeeming feature at this point(well, other than the nudity) was that there had been no messing about with plot history, something which bugged me in all the other films.  Anyway, so there's this naked girl walking about and you just know she's going to get butchered.  Suddenly Jason appears, surprisingly the girl does the smart thing and bolts for the door.  After Jason gives pursuit she dives over her car and heads for a clearing in the trees.  Jason follows and as the girl hides behind a bush he is startlingly hit by huge floodlight beams, then a S.W.A.T team formulates around him, pumping him full of lead. My jaw is hitting the ground at this point, and the fun hasn't even started. Finally Jason gets blown into a thousand pieces by a rocket launcher, and thats it right?  Jason goes to hell.  Wrong.  What follows is some of the most exciting horror/action stuff I've seen.  Ignore the sticky back plot and just watch zombie Jason walk his way through about 25+ grisly murders in this action packed beauty of a film.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

If you remove one of the elements of that super easy formula then you will not be successful.

First time a ""plot"" is used in the series is a total disaster. More BS than T&A(although there is one graphic sex scene, but it is brutally interrupted by Jason), more bore than gore.

Well, the movie had way to much of a story, we do not want a complicated plot, when we go see a Friday the 13th I don't plan on having to think a whole lot, I just want to see blondes running through the woods screaming, and Jason with some metal sharp object. How hard is that? Please people trust me don't watch this movie, all of the ones before are excellent, buy them, rent them, just stay away from this mess!!

201,Kendich89,This film should've gone to hell and stayed there,4,29 October 2017,"As with most good horror films the original Friday The 13th was bound to be doomed by endless sequels, remakes, reboots and all the works.Since watching the original many years ago I have been lured by its dark charm and followed the rest of the franchise with hopes of seeing, at least for once, a sequel that stayed true to the premise of its predecessor and not go off on a wild tangent. Sad to say they just went from worse to disastrous. In Jason Goes to Hell we're once again brought to the attention of the mythic Jason Voorhees and his blood-soaked, shadow-filled habitat. The plot's pretty much a carbon copy of the previous ones- naked girls taking the mandatory shower, light bulbs going out, teens having sex then getting butchered, jump scares every two minutes or so... The difference here is that the score is even worse than the previous one and, to the agonizing logic of any so-called fan, the theme of sorcery has been incorporated (dear god) in attempt to bring something to the exhausted story. This device has another purpose as well. After numerous movies in which we see Jason being shot at, stabbed, decapitated, drowned, etc., we'd come to the conclusion that Jason can't be human because he just keeps coming back, hence the flimsy fantasy element. For me personally this ruined the whole story. I preferred to think of Jason as a deformed, demented survivor living in the woods and taking it out on anyone who enters and disturbs his land. The original was a completely different kind of beast from all that followed. What we see here is another money-maker with no respect for the original whatsoever.

202,LuckyMatt93,A really enjoyable installment,8,14 June 2009,"Jason Goes To Hell is an underrated flick (much better than Part 6, Part 8, JX, and FVJ; all of which were atrocities). It IS very silly and does mess with Jason's mythology, but still, the positive aspects are plentiful. The gore in this entry obviously benefited from the bigger budget, with easily some of the best and most gruesome murders in the series. The sexuality and nudity are also kicked up, keeping continuity with the rest of the series. The overall movie is incredibly fun and entertaining, even if it doesn't exactly fit with the other movies in the series. With it's gore and excessive campiness, it still holds true to many of the conventions of the series. This is an undeniably goofy, tongue-in-cheek horror film full of a few well-played gambles, some good humour (thankfully this installment has it's limits and doesn't go overboard with it like Part 6), and features one of the best out-of-left-field endings since the first Sleepaway Camp.Jason Goes To Hell isn't at the top of my list for the Friday The 13th series, but it's also not at the very bottom either.

As part of the series, well, lets just say there is a lot to complain about, but on its own - its not bad. Certainly has a bit more personality than the other films.

Now, some of the F-13 fans didn't like this movie; most likely since the hockey masked one wasn't in it like he usually is. But if you like Sci-Fi movies, take a chance on this one. It's a fresh start for the F-13 series, plus the first one done by New Line Cinema. But the best part about this movie is that the video release is the director's cut, which has a ton of scenes that didn't make it in the theater.

And yet surprisingly, it's just as bombastic as Jason Takes Manhattan. After arguably a fantastic opening sequence, that inexplicably brings a full grown ""monstrous"" Jason back from Toxic Waste Boyhood, and then systematically blows him to smithereens - we are treated to the return, and unfortunately the worst Harry Manfredini score; A Heart munching Coroner; and a ridiculous Hidden-esque Body-Hopping, Roaring Jason.In an even more peculiar move, that will have you screaming for good ol' ROY, the ""real Jason"" doesn't return until the last 5 minutes of the flick - That is after demon child Jason, burrows his way out of some copper's neck and he is ""reborn"", hockey mask and all, through his dead sister's body.Yes, you read that correctly. Admittedly, if you're a rabid Jason fan, you'll undoubtedly cheer for his return, even if it's mere minutes before he gets pulled into hell by the Fraggle Rock gang.The tagged on teaser ending is also sure to please die-hard fans that were waiting (and kept waiting for 10 years!!) for the ultimate modern era monster movie match up!There are some intentionally comedic moments as well, and if seen in it's UNRATED edition, this film boasts some of the goriest (but occasionally choppy) Friday kills ever. If they kept it simple, and expanded upon the opening sequence, with the bounty hunter character, we may have had the ultimate post Paramount Friday movie.

213,dysamoria,this one was for people like me,4,15 November 2007,"i'm a sucker for science fiction twists in horror genres. i like plots willing to try to come up with explanations for the unexplainable. i'm also a sucker for horror movies with a sense of humour. and finally... i have always found, with the exception of the previous film, the entire F13 franchise to be a pointless and boring repeat of itself in location, plot, method, execution, and cinematography. i was never a fan. not ever. i have derided this franchise and continue to do so.The franchise was ridiculous. why not just own up to it and make it fun at the same time? this was tried a couple times, such as Jason Takes Manhattan and an even earlier attempt at putting this thing where it belongs: stupid but knows it and is willing to take the extra leap of stupidity to make you have some fun with it.second: those fans who hate that this film ""abandons"" the existing franchise's established history don't seem to recognize when a franchise is... uh... a franchise. As in ""formula"" and ""repetition"" and ""can be bought and modified by each director and producer as they see fit so long as it brings in money and maintains the branding.""AND as someone said about the second and third films, the area should have been crawling with police and the whole world should have known about this psycho and then living-dead dude by the time seven of these movies were out. or at least the government should have stepped in for the clichéd attempt to control and then benefit from something freaky like a zombie (and this is where the spoilers start), which is exactly what this film does. it brings the outside world into play. as ridiculous as the movie is, it recognizes some levels of suspension of disbelief are too much.when this film came on TV, and yes, i saw it on TV, i was bored, so i watched it. i kept watching it because the opening scene is such a huge payoff. THEY KNOW the formula and they used his own M.O. to trap him and kick his ass. They did it well and with ease. Then they even attempt to STUDY him to figure him out. i was actually excited to see this totally nuts twist in the worn out repetitious franchise that only changed a bit with the previous film. What is it with hard core fans of certain things that cannot stand CHANGE? What is the point in seeing the same thing over and over?? As for the coroner or medical examiner's choice (spoiler coming) to just shrug his shoulders and bite into the heart after it gets his attention, it was kind of like an aside which said to us ""We know this series is ridiculous and there are so many times when explanations for the revival of Jason are retarded so we're not going to even offer one here because we're poking fun at it and refusing to waste time over the USUAL why and how... we just decided to jump in and go with it in a nonsensical manner."" Hence the comical ""oh, what the hell"" shrug the guy makes. And how can you NOT think this film had gore? Even on TV i thought the first kill made by the possessed examiner was not only clever but totally meat-filled gross.Last thing i'm going to say is that i was glad i kept watching for the humour of the following scene: (more spoilers) After the Jason worm creature finds a new host, he straps the guy down on a table to keep him controlled. He goes to transfer via mouth, but... he just can't... bring himself to DO it because the guy's face is so hairy!!! He actually spends the time to get shaving supplies and shave the dude's face, shaky hand with straight blade, and the squirming victim worrying about getting cut despite the much larger danger he's in... this scene had it all! Totally brilliant! AGAIN: it knows what it is and it doesn't pretend to be anything more and then goes that extra step to make it OK to laugh at it and even to make you laugh at the situational insanity.This film wasn't for you die-hard franchise repeat consumers. This one was for people like me. i gave it 4 out of ten just for that alone.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
214,eddie-177,A messy film with some saving graces,6,23 September 2020,"Much has been written about this film's troubled development--rushed dailies apparently led to ruined shots, forcing a reliance on recycled footage, and upward of an hour was cut post-production. I'm judging the film as it actually appears on the screen, not what it could have been.And what appears on screen is messy. It feels like it was shot from a first draft of a script. There's no real character development, the pacing is nonsensical even by slasher movie standards, and the script introduces key plot elements without regard to the fact that they were completely missing from the previous films in the series. Also, the two protagonists are flat and lifeless and unappealing played.In spite of these setbacks, the film is still pretty enjoyable. The script is messy but not incomprehensible. Most importantly, the practical effects are far and away the best in the series--memorable kills combined with some very cool body horror elements. While the main characters aren't engaging, the supporting cast is great. Steven Williams shines as the bizarrely out of place bounty hunter, and Rusty Schwimmer damn near steals the show as a venal, domineering cafe owner with an undersized boyfriend and a thick Wisconsin accent.This is far from a necessary picture, but it's plenty enjoyable if you're looking for a goofy slasher movie with great, gory effects.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

I can watch a movie like Evil Dead 2 and know that the acting is bad, the effects are bad, the plot is stupid...but I LOVE IT ANYWAY!  So for a horror movie fan to hate a horror movie, well that says more than a drama fan hating a drama. And boy, oh boy, did I hate this.  It chokes me up that people see this and think that Jason is some sort of body-jumping demon that can only be killed with a magic dagger by a relative.  That is a complete betrayal to all of the fans who keep going to Friday movies!  Did they really think this was going to be good?  Even with its gory kills and hidden 'tributes' to other horror movies, it still sits with Halloween 3 and Jaws 4 among the very worst horror films of all time. See parts 1 through 4 and STOP.  The critics pan all of these movies equally but horror fans know...part 4 is the best, part 9 should never have been made.  Even though this series has been on a SEVERE downward spiral for the past three chapters, I'll still be at Jason X opening night, ticket in hand, hoping for a miracle, even though the idea of Jason in space makes me cringe.

If Jason would have swung his machete an inch or two closer this hot babe wrapped and tucked in a towel would have been disemboweled picking up her intestines off the floor.Well, Jason gets blown to bits again by an airstrike called in by the FBI because their armory of small arms weren't doing the job just giving Jason bad gas.His bits are turned over to the federal morgue in Youngstown Ohio for an autopsy. The movie winks at the audience through several bad in-jokes and features a cameo appearance by Kane Hodder as a security FBI agent on guard detail.The examining coroner looks the remains over gives the heart closer inspection when it starts pumping like a live heart, the examining coroner's eyes glaze over and he pick ups the heart consumes it. There is a cheap light show and the examining coroner belts out a brontosaurus roar. More winks at the audience when the assistant coroner arrives.Robert a anchorman for American Case files television show informs viewers Jason is at large after leaving a trail of bodies in the Federal morgue and a swath of five or six bodies on a clearly defined path back to Crystal Lake. He interviews Creighton Duke at the bounty hunter's secret compound where Duke informs that Jason is a body snatcher that can't be destroyed except by one means. (This Duke dude has all the inside information on Jason Voorhees.) He boasts that he can find Jason and kill him for a $500,000 reward. Robert informs his audience that he and the syndicate have met Duke's demands.After this the film gets incredibly convoluted and asinine involving relatives of Jason Voorhees, a mother Diana, a daughter Jessica, and her baby. An ex-boyfriend named Steve (the baby's father). Crystal Lake businesses are exploiting the new series of murders with hamburgers shaped like hockey masks and finger fries. No body minds the fact an invincible mass murderer is coming their way. Creighton Duke gets jailed for an altercation with the chief of police in the diner.Jessica is now dating anchorman Robert but before she can surprise her mother Diana the mother is killed by the body snatching Jason only now in the form of a slug that moves from gullet to gullet through the mouth. Little does Jessica know that she is being exploited for ratings. Steve her ex-boyfriend is apprehended in suspicion of Diana's murder.Steve meets Creighton Duke in the next cell and the bounty hunter lets him know that ""Only through a Voorhees can Jason be reborn and only through a Voorhees can Jason be destroyed"". Together they pull off a jailbreak. Steve goes snooping at the Voorhees estate where he overhears Robert schemes and watches in horror as Robert is body snatched by the Jason slug.Jason pursues Jessica and the baby through a series of chases involving body snatching along the way for the final climax in which Duke tosses a dagger to Jessica and it becomes an enchanted fantasy sword to stab Jason in the heart and send him to hell. With the help of Steve they both succeed, Jason is drug down to hell by demons and in a final scene Freddy Krueger's glove and striped sleave shirt break the surface pulling down the final piece of Jason left.. his hockey mask with great maniacal laughter.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

Well, let's see Take a bunch of retarded teenagers, isolate them in Crystal Lake (preferably) and let the countdown begin. The lovers will get it because they doin'it, the stoners will get it because they smokin'it, the rockers will get it because they like rock n'roll (and are badly dressed) and the nerd will get it because huh he's a nerd (and also badly dressed) The prude and pure will survive from The Ultimate Bad Ass Meathead incarnate: Jason Voorhees. Until the next film that is. Et voila! I just wrote a brand new Friday the 13th! So the answer is obviously no. There's nothing more predictable than a Friday the 13th flick.""Jason Goes To Hell, The Final Friday"" however is another beast. The film finally took the series away from its bloody routine (as if we've been waiting for it to happen) by making Jason a parasite going from one body to another (""Hidden"" anyone?) allowing him to carry on what he does best. And he does it alright! With panache! The deaths are inventive and fun, the FX are good qualities and the acting is decent.The plot feels a tiny bit far fetched but at least there's a plot of some sort (which is much more than you could ever say from any other Friday). Why this movie suffers from the well deserved bad rating of the other movies is mystery to me.Sure it's still the same slice and dice game all over but the efforts to keep this 9th instalment different and entertaining should have been taken into consideration.This ""Final Friday"" is not as much a Friday the 13th as it is a good old b movie in its own right.

The whole reason he was scary was because he was this backwoods, crazy type of character that was based soley in legend and newspaper writings.  Putting him on TV sucks. So does having the  FBI go after him.2) He looks stupid in this one.  That skin bubbling over the hockey mask is just dumb.3) They try to put too much plot in it.

From here on Jason wields a hockey mask and kills and and gets killed to be returned from the gave in more and more silly, crazy and yet fun horror ways to keep the audience coming back for more! The concept of the originals point of view killings to not know who was the murderer was kept in use for well into the 5th or 6th movie - despite we all knew it was Jason!! Who is Jason - a 7ft, hockey mask wearing, unstoppable, mass murdering, undead nutter! He kills and kills and then finally is stopped - then a running gag - he always comes back!!! It was fun - not great but fun horror!Then this came along - Jason is taken out within the first few minutes, then a possession story starts! Peoplee become possessed by Jason! So no hockey masked man - just ordinary people looking evil. - How boring is that - If I want to watch that - I will watch Law and Order!! The story of Jasons long lost heir and them being the only one to stop him - ripped straight from Freddy 6. That film gave freddy a fairwell in style - it was fun - not joe bloggs with a freddy glove!If i remember rightly the only high point was when in last few minutes of film - Jason finally comes back - with new mask!! and then is beaten - and the Freddy glove rises from hell and pulls his mask to hell - paving the way for the 2003 film - Freddy vs Jason! - Which I might add was a great film compared to the last individual outings of said characters!!Overall this film sucked!

224,ThomasBleedPHD,Not Great.,6,21 July 2015,"I have to be honest, I originally gave this film a scathing review, but upon re-watching it I liked it better than I remembered. So, here's a new review matching my current thoughts.""Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday"" is a mess of a movie, but a surprisingly enjoyable one. Corporate shenanigans and budgetary issues plagued the franchise in the late eighties and most of the nineties, leaving us with Manhattan movies that only spent an hour in Manhattan and a sequel where Jason turned into a cyborg and went into space. Even though these three movies were complete schlock and bad examples of executive meddling, they all came out surprisingly watchable.Jason films are actually fairly consistent in quality in comparison to other horror franchises. Knowing Jason's films are actually a step in quality above other films is either inspiring or disheartening, depending on how you look at it.The film takes a huge departure from other films in the franchise, with Jason dying right at the start in one of the most enjoyable and satisfying scenes in the entire franchise. The effect of Jason blowing up is a fantastic piece of special effects work. The full is full of really good gore effects, including a scene where a man's body melts.In this film, Jason is an evil spirit hopping bodies until he can kill a relative and be reborn. The details of how this all works are left sketchy and vague, but we see a Necronomicon at his parent's house. I like a little ambiguity in my horror.If you're looking for a traditional Jason movie with a guy in a hockey mask stalking and killing people, this one is kind of a letdown. However, even though it does something fairly different, it's surprisingly fun to watch. The dynamic of a killer switching bodies and slaughtering people is actually fairly cool.Overall, out of all the Friday the 13th films, this may be the weakest one. But it's a surprising guilty pleasure.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

It doesn't make sense to you and it probably never will. If it came down to it, go with Jason Goes to Hell, because Paris Hilton, sucks, big time. But back to Jason. Jason Goes to Hell basically is the directors attempt to try and make Jason more than just a brute, slashing, zombie.However in the end it just goes even more so. Adding fuel to the fire for people who hate the Friday series. And with this installment, who can blame them? The premise itself is very ridiculous, Jason is blown into a million pieces, then comes back through the bodies of others. Wow, great plot right? Well maybe if you like trying to think about what the hell is going on.You start with a coroner, he eats Jason's heart. That makes sense... moving on. Jason goes around killing teens and adults again. And then eventually (For the last few minutes of the film.) Becomes himself again. Add in the mix of a Bounty Hunter who has a grudge (For an unexplained reason.) A family dagger which can somehow kill Jason, and Freddy Kreuger. And you have yourself a movie filled with more plot holes than teens murdered. This film does make up for it with more 'inventive' kills, but not even that can make this film great.

227,Admiral-3,"Get thee behind me, Satan",5,17 September 1998,"Adam Marcus' installment in this infamous series takes a sharp left turn off the main road, and the result is an interesting ride of mixed emotions. Produced by Sean S. Cunningham, Jason Goes to Hell presumes for the first time that Crystal Lake is not in a Twilight Zone of its own, and attempts to show up its place in the world.Jason, it appears, is renowned as the deadliest serial killer in the world, and a favorite subject of tabloid journalists.  One ""Inside Affair""-type program even goes so far as to hire a bounty hunter to rid the world of Jason's evil.  The FBI is also out to get the masked man.  To do this, a pretty girl is sent alone to the woods of Crystal Lake to strip nude and climb in the shower.  This is the bait, to lure Jason out of hiding.  When he bites, the young woman runs him into a trap, and Jason is suddenly surrounded by machine guns, rifles, and a grenade launcher, and blown to chunks of seared and smoking flesh.  There is no mention of how the FBI SWAT team members manage not to kill each other in the crossfire.This is the first ten minutes of the film, just before that sharp left turn.It is at this point that we learn Jason is nothing more than a demonic worm (literally), capable of possessing human bodies and using them to his own means until they disintigrate and become useless.  He makes his way, in one body or another, back to Crystal Lake.  His mission, we understand, is to become ""reborn"" of his own flesh via the body of another Voorhees. Ah-ha.The screenplay comes across as something out of Quentin Tarantino's worst nightmare, with surreal gunfights and sleazy characters, but does manage to work up a few creepy sequences, such as the figure lurking in the dark garage, illuminated red in the tail lights of a parked car.Of course, Jason *is* reborn of his own flesh in the end, prtrayed once more by Kane Hodder, and his duel to the death with John D. LeMay's sympathetically-drawn character Steven, is a root-for-whoever-seems-to-be-winning climax that does work up a little adrenaline.  Think of it as Jason hits Big-Time Wrestling.In the end, as you might guess, Jason is hauled down to Hell by the clumsy, groping hands of subterranean demons, with a little help from an old friend at New Line.This is the kind of film that you watch with absolutely no idea whether it is good or bad.  And then you remember that it is another Friday the 13th entry, and it's hard to argue with logic that sound.  The result is a second consecutive, solidly adequate thriller for this series, which is still unable to read its head completely out of the cellar, but makes a good try.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
228,stephen-59,Awesome!,10,30 July 1999,Jason has returned. Sure he get's blown to tiny pieces at the start. But that isn't going to stop him! Apparently he can take control of other peoples bodies. And even though it's called Jason Goes To Hell as we all know that ain't gonna stop him either. Because at the end his mask is pulled into the ground by Freddy Krueger's glove.

229,meetjopeblack,this film should go where Jason went,1,5 February 2005,"The opening sequence is a failure. A closer contact between Jason and the victim could have drawn us into the movie much better. The old formula of sex/nudity + a slasher doesn't appeal anymore. The camera technique, editing, and sound don't work together to keep its audience at the edge of their seats. After the first sequence, you'll know that there is nothing much to expect in this film. For a horror flick to work, the opening sequence should say it all and must entice the audience that this film will scare them to death till the end).This last installment of the Friday the 13th series simply doesn't have ""it"" to make you want to finish the film. It doesn't bother with the story anymore. It felt like its only goal is to be more brutal than the previous killings. It introduces new characters every after a killing which further alienates the viewers from the film. No depth; no emotional tie up with the characters; each character is simply another object awaiting their gory mutilation. Unless you have a penchant for murders and brutality then this movie isn't just worth your while. Or even if you have a thing for gore, this movie has nothing new to offer--it's a been there, done that kind of thing. So uninteresting.I don't understand why the producers of this series, knowing that this is the last, would not put much thought on how to end Jason's classic plight. OR maybe, it's just that the series have exhausted all there is to exhaust of Jason and this movie hasn't got enough juice to quench the audience for an hour and a half of the worn out, dried up Jason story.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

There's good suspense, twists and the end is an unexpected surprise.

Hardly any of it makes any sense and it is an affront to the rest of the series. When Jason does appear on screen, which isn't very long, he looks pathetic. Bloated and fat, his head looks like someone glued marshmallows to it. It's the worst look in the entire series. The only thing this movie has going for it is some of the kills, which admittedly, are good. But all that aside, it's the story. That awful story. Jason is actually a large worm that has to relocate to another body when his is destroyed. Then he has to jump from body to body to survive and the only way to kill him is for one of his relatives to stab him with a special dagger that some guy in black has been lugging around. It is so ridiculously convoluted. The premise for a good Friday film is simple. Have Jason in the woods killing people. Make the kills creative, make the atmosphere creepy, and have one or two competent survivors left to face off against Jason. That's it. That's what works.

Its like bad ANOES sequel (as they all are). Its from same production company too, Paramount sell rights to do F13 sequels to New Line Cinema after making horrible Jason Takes Manhattan and when it didn't make so good gross. And even though some people think, this movie didn't flop, it got a decent box office gross, not that good it could and what F13 movies have had in their best but decent for all. And come on, plot is weakest part in every F13 movie and slasher films too. If you want completely same stuff in every movie, watch old ones for several times.

My first question is. Why did they wait till he killed over 80 people to blow him to pieces? This film starts amazingly. Great opener, great death, and made me sit back and go... WOW.

This film shouldn't be in the 'Friday' series, its a disappointment, not only is it not Jason through the whole film, but the fact that he is still invincible even when not being Jason, and for some reason wants to keep changing his look, just becomes plain annoying. And why didn't we see the evil slimy thing inside him in the other EIGHT FILMS!? This film turns Friday the 13th from Horror, to a Horror Sci-Fi hybridBut at the same time, what a great Horror film! Gore! Scares! And (like most Fridays) Topless chicks!'Jason Goes to hell' includes all the ingredients that make a horror film, but it's the wrong recipe for a Friday the 13th. You would of thought by now, (after 8 films) the camp would have been completely shut off! Leave Jason alone, as long as no-one goes near his turf then no-one gets hurt. They should have left it that way.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

237,carnage-karo,Voodoo-Jason strikes back... - again!,3,1 December 2005,"After the first installment of Friday the 13th the series began to roll down the hill. Then part 6 came up and brought some hilarious humor and irony to the movies but the downhill started over shortly after it. This one is actually the last traditional Jason-movie with the Camp Crystal Lake and everything between in it, before they really took it too far in the ridicules sci-fi/horror/comedy Jason X and the silliest of the silliest ""VS.-movie"" Freddy vs. Jason.Jason goes to hell starts off pretty promising and makes you believe there's actually going to be some good action in this one (finally!). But no - After the speedy opening we are once again introduced to the stupidest teenagers i've ever seen and idiotic deputies standing in front of jason shooting at him and wondering why nothing happens. With just a few barely entertaining gore-scenes and some references and tributes to other famous horror movies, Final Friday manages to be one the most boring Jason-movies of all time. I recommend it only for the true fans of the series, others (even general horror fans) don't watch it, you'll waste your precious time.Oh, and as you probably already guessed: Jason doesn't go to hell for too long in spite of the title. But then again, these guys always keep coming back. Three stars for the interesting opening and funny tributes.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
238,ImmortallyInsane,Jason reborn,8,26 March 2006,"This is part 9 of the Friday series and while others don't like this film, I think it is the best of the series. I have my reasons and I will explain them.First: In this part, there is an actual story to be told. The other movies were basically this: Teens go to Crystal Lake, teens get slaughtered one by one, one of the teens stays alive, the same teen kills Jason, everything is over. No story whatsoever is to be found anywhere, except for Part 1, which of course has to have some kind of plot, but even it is mostly mindless bloodshed. With part 9, we get an actual storyline.Jason's body that we all know and love is just that: a body, one that he has been using since, well, forever. It is not his true form. Jason is seemingly killed, yet his heart still beats. His soul passes through other people's bodies until he can be reborn through a Vorhees. Along the way, he kills a coroner, a few security guards, a bunch of cops, and a the obligatory few teens having premarital sex.*Side note: Jason must be God's handyman. He eliminates those who sin. I think every teenager who has had sex in the entire series gets killed. Way to go Jason!* Now this story may not make sense to some, but to me it makes perfect sense. Sure, nothing has ever been mentioned about Jason having a sister, a house, etc, but I enjoy the plot so much that it really is irrelevant to me. I enjoy films with actual plots and stories, and this one has both, and both are good.Second: The acting. The acting in this is miles better than any film in the series. You can believe the characters. You can feel their urgency to kill Jason once and for all.Third: The characters. In the entire series I have never felt anything for the characters. They weren't believable. They were just there for meat to be butchered. Steven Williams' character Creighton Duke is superb, and he does a good job as always bringing the character to life. And you gotta feel for Steven(John D. LeMay), as he gets thrown around more than anyone in the entire series. He takes a lot of punishment and I mean a lot. LeMay does a great job with his character.Fourth: The climactic ending. Jason is beating the hell out of Steven, and just when you think he is going to kill him, Jason is stabbed in the heart by Jessica(Kari Keegan) and is sent to hell forever. I love the scene where Duke, Jessica and Steven are in the Vorhees house and the parasite/demon thing(Jason's true self) goes under the floor and crawls into Jessica's dead mother, thus being reborn. Jason explodes through the floorboards, hockey mask and all, and there is this feeling of awe, however corny that may sound.If you like gore, then this is definitely the goriest of the F13th series. Tons of blood is constant throughout and there is a great death with the one girl at the diner near the end(only in the unrated version does it show her real fate.) One thing that many fans don't like is the fact that Jason is only shown at the beginning and at the very end. I don't see this as a problem as the story doesn't call for it. Besides, whenever one of the people Jason is in goes by a mirror, we see Jason's reflection, so he is in it more than you think.Check out the scene with Steven and the cop, both with guns drawn on each other. Funny as hell.There is also a lot of good camera work and you can tell the film was made with a higher budget than the others. The picture is clear and the sound is excellent.I recommend this to Jason fans who have an open mind. If this truly is the Final Friday, then I am happy it turned out to be a helluva good time.*Side note: Jason X is just terrible. I don't even count it with the Friday the 13th series. Freddy vs Jason wasn't a sequel to this so this is for now the last F13th.* Hopefully we get another Friday movie soon, as I know I want to see more Jason films made. Recommended.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
239,simpsibum,New line had to do it!,1,8 October 2005,"OK, let me sum up this film in two words, Bloody Crap! I am a big fan of the F13 series and was disappointed by this failure of the film. I liked the F13, loved part 2+3, could have married the final chapter, thought 5 was o.k, 6 was brilliant then 7+8 not to good. But this is the Halloween III and the Freddy's dead of the F13 series. What really bugged me is final's are suppose to be a important chapter. Freddys dead was appalling and so was Jason goes to hell. It opens with an o.k scene (note Jason looks pathetic in the bits he is in, he looks like a bloody mushroom) were Jason is chasing a woman through the woods. But what he didn't know was that she was really an FBI agent who was leading him into a trap. They blow Jason to pieces which I thought was a little odd. Then one of the stupidest scene in cinematic history occurs. A man is doing an autopsy on Jason and picks up his heart and shoves it into his mouth. mmmm, as much as the heart looked tasty I doubt anyone would suddenly start eating it. So he shoves Jason's heart into his mouth and gets possessed. What the f**K! So Jason jumps from person to person like out of the body snatchers, and kills characters that are not even built up. But there's more, Jason's sister comes out of nowhere (ripping off Halloween). Right remember in F13 when Pamela Voorhees say 'Jason, my ONLY child. Right, she is definitely younger than Jason. Is it me or did Mrs.Voorhees have no f*****g head, so it is not likely she could have another child. There's far too much slow motion in this movie and as I said already Jason looks like a demented mushroom with long hair. You only see Jason right at the beginning and right at the end. No matter how much you want to see this movie just pass it and go to Jason X which is alright. This film ruined F13th series for me and it will for you to. I expected this s**t from a bum of a directer like Adam Marcus or whatever his name is, but Sean S. Cunningham, I'm disgusted with you!",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
240,midwestdawg83,Connection to TV Series and Other Points,6,13 October 2021,"I just started watching the 1980s FRIDAY THE 13th TV series this past year. The main actor from that show helps to kill Jason in the end. It's too bad they didn't keep his character name as well. The TV series is pretty awesome, no connections to the film series cannon wise though.So, as in the TV series, a magic item must be found to kill the monster. It's a nice tie-in to the series. Makes sense now why there is a fist fight at the end, as only THAT hero from the TV series could do such a thing. He finally got to fight Jason.Other
-some of the grossest stuff in a Jason film. Guy eating heart, woman cut in half, guy's body melting. The makeup was pretty good compared to 8.-I liked they made some backstory to the family and we got to see the house for the first time. I like the mythology of the series more than the Jason kills. More supernatural elements were introduced to add some diversity to the series.-music is bad, acting is hit and miss.-Two of the Jason demon possessions are acted well. Main hero did a good job. The bounty hunter was original and would have loved to seen him live, be in more movies. When you look back at previous movies, some of the characters were terrible and annoying as hell. The annoying diner staff gets killed, rather brutally.-Jason's worm demon was on a mission with a goal. Plot holes I know, but makes more sense than just wantonly killing a bunch of teens.

I was told by a friend that it was a horrible piece of trash, but i liked watching the previous 8 films(although some aren't the greatest slashers ever made)so i sat down hoping to enjoy this as much as the other sequels. All I have to say is that not only is this one of the worst horror movies ever made, not only is it the worst Jason movie ever made, but it may be one of the worst movies ever made. I hate this movie with a passion and I am so glad they left it out of the Friday box set(for those of you who don't know, it stops with part 8, which should have been the final Friday, but no....Sean Cunningham had to f--- it up. The first 8 films had one long continuous storyline, 8 had a good conclusion to the series.

The beginning was awesome, A sexy chick was about to take a bath when suddenly Jason appears to kill her(Oh Yeah, Jason!), he pursues her through the entire camp, then it's later revealed it was all a trap and the FBI ambush Jason and start to shoot him, seemingly destroying him, but unknown to them, his black heart continues beating, and after Jason's body was sent into the morgue, a doctor finds the heart and starts eating it letting Jason's dark soul to posses him to kill again, he does this several times, until, in the end...

Unbelievable. only gave it a 2 because it has Jason and i was able to watch the whole thing with out switching off. The plot of this film is so diabolical, it's not even got anything to do with Jason, it's over the top cheesy Hollywood, but is so bad u can't even laugh at it. They even used Kane Hodder (Jason) to play the part of a security guard, perhaps cos they couldn't be bothered to cast someone else. IF they used him twice to be funny or give the Friday fans something extra, this is equally as bad. There was big gap between part 8 and 9 so you would have expected them to have come up with something better than this. If this is the only Friday you have seen, this film has no reflection on the others in the series. This film should not have been made.

My friend and I watched this at about 3am. While we were watching it, we thought that maybe it was a spoof of the old Friday The 13th series, and sub plotted under comedy. IT WASN'T!!!!It starts off with a woman going to Camp Crystal Lake. Just when she's about to take a shower, Jason comes out of no-where, and chases her. The chasing continues until they get into the middle of the forest, and FBI agents come out of no-where, and blow Jason up. JASON IS DEAD! Or is he? When the Coroner is examining Jason's body parts, he finds that Jason's heart starts beating... And for some reason, unknown to man, the coroner, picks up Jason's heart, and eats it.

The movie is stuck between the traditional slasher film, and the on-the-horizon self-parody ""Scream""-style films. At least it's a transition.What kept us looking through the cracks of our fingers, in the first three or four movies, is Jason's ""oneness"" with the woods -- Camp Crystal Lake. The majority of Jason Goes To Hell is spent in doors, at police stations, or in cars. The ideas are there, but lack execution.

249,chris-stanley67,Biggest pile of turd you will ever watch.,1,25 November 2008,"I'd have given this garbage less than a one if it was possible, no, seriously. As a fan of sorts of the three main slash hack and kill films that all originated at around the same time, Halloween, Friday 13th and the Nightmare on Elm Street films, I'd got comfortable with a certain kind of plot. Yes it was the same one pretty much time after time, but for horror fans, they were good, gave us what we wanted pretty consistently in the case of Halloween and Friday 13th and this film goes some way to proving the age old saying 'if you have a winning formula, don't mess with it'. The writers of this need locking up. Worse, they need putting in a room with Jason. Complete and utter garbage just aren't the right words to describe this failure of a movie, they just aren't strong enough. From the first minute of the film right the way through to the last you are left with unanswered questions and leaps of fancy that even horror fans will struggle to come to terms with.The opening scenes sum that up nicely, the tag line, which refers to the writer of the first returning to make the last is one i can only assume meant that the film had been seen by the creator of that tag, he'd agreed with me 100% and felt that the writers had managed to kill off the series more gruesomely with one puerile script that Jason ever managed to pull off with his victims. The actors are the people I feel sorry for in all of this because although they hardly outshine themselves, they haven't much to work with initially and the looks on some of their faces as they plough gamely through their lines suggest they cant believe the crap they've been given either. Any of them who felt taking a part in this would lead to bigger and better things should send their application in to a certain fast food chain immediately. At least they'll have the clowns in common in either position. If you really feel you have to watch this, for gods sake get drunk first, at least that way you'll be able to put the utter confusion and mind numbing tedium down to whatever you drank and if you can manage to swig enough, it may numb your brain enough for you to get through the entire film.

Oh, and yes, Jason's return is not explained- but I think that was the best and only way to go after part VIII's slimy sewer ending. I don't believe they disregarded this, or took the easy way out. Rather, they clearly took a sane approach by jumping ahead and switching the focus. I've heard many angry fans condemn this picture, but they aren't really seeing it in the right light (so to speak). So turn the lights off, turn off the criticism and watch it again. Listen to the Director's commentary. Indulge in all the fantastic FX and awesome atmosphere the film offers.

The rest of the films are comic book adaptations of the basic Jason story.However this movie doesn't even fall into the aforementioned category. In fact this has nothing to do with Friday 13th at all. So I can't even call it a comic book adaptation of the F13 films. The only thing linking this to F13 is Jason.... and Jason is not even Jason, SPOILER..... Jason a 1ft worm that lives in People and can transfer from person to person. Why didn't Jason use this power in the other films I'll never know.The characters are useless. One character knows everything about Jason, I mean stuff the fans never knew. Like Jason lived in a big house not a shack like shown in part 2, he has a sister and a niece. Apparently the goalie mask that he got in Part 3 off a fat kid is in Jason's DNA. He is reborn in this movie with it. Also Jason has Xmen powers that can alter weather causing storms as he dies. (Actualy this could explain why it starts to storm at the end of the F13 movies) Finally the cream of the crop... The FBI uses a fighter jet that blows Jason up. Your probably thinking that is how it ends ..... no folks that's how it starts.This is a complete waste of time unless you want a laugh.

257,Breakdancing Zombie,Smarter and slicker than given credit for...,7,1 April 2002,"Spoilers Spoilers Spoilers Spoilers Spoilers Spoilers Spoilers Spoilers SpoilersThe Friday the 13th seriesWhat can be said about this precedent-setting 80's teen slasher series? Well, over my few years I've seen all of these, and to be quite frank the series was beginning to wear thin (for some more than others). I'd always enjoyed them for their inventive deaths and fair snaking plot, but by number eight things were beginning to get tired. The same plot; teens get hacked up at Camp Crystal Lake (with a few field trips elsewhere) just didn't have the flair it once did despite Jason's use of everything from axes to spearguns to hedgetrimmers. He just seemed to be getting bored of the whole thing himself, not moving with the same quickness and energy he once did, just kind of stomping along hacking and dicing at his own leisure, making things equally uninspired at seeing him go about his deeds.Like I said I was getting kind of bored with the series but for the sake of completeness I decided to check out the supposed `last chapter' of the series. I was already eliciting groans in the opening reel as yet another idiotic bimbo going to Camp Crystal Lake to get hacked up. Groan. Well imagine my excitement and delight when being chased through the woods she does an acrobatic roll and an FBI SWAT team jumps from the oh so familiar dark woods and begins to pump rounds into Jason. A lot of people don't like this scene because it effectively ends Jasons involvement in the movie until the end. Personally this marks a new, fresh direction for the movie. It acknowledges the fact that the authorities would find out about this kind of thing after a while, and it actively plays on the viewers sense of familiarity with the series to lure them into the trap that the movie has laid.From here on the movie takes a very un-Jasonish turn and makes him into a Fallen-esqe body jumping killer. The movies suspense works well enough, and does a great job of explaining the backstory, and most importantly creating interesting characters. The main character is a tough geek, and the bounty hunter Creighton Duke is appropriately tough and gruff. They both are well rounded enough for the movie, especially in a series where most characters are not developed to obscure who might be killed. Here, however, strong lead roles are created and adhered to giving the viewer a much greater attachment to the characters since they actually know that much more about them than the average slasher flick.At the same time there was gore galore for those who are in need of that, as well as plenty of deaths and some nice real (as in not CG) special effects that round things out nicely. Overall this movie was a great change of pace and setting (Jason takes the fight to a number of fun locales, including a police station) that really makes this one special. Many seem not to like because of it's deviation both in location and personification of the Friday the 13th movies, but it is a change for the better, and pumps new vitality into this once ailing series. A lot of people really seem to be violent against the idea of Jason only being in part of the movie, but it makes for a good breather before the full assault in Jason X, and the body jumping angle is pulled off skillfully. I personally think things get stale after a while, but for those looking to this movie to provide more woods stalking fun near Crystal Lake, should best steer clear, this one is for those seeking something different, but still executed stylishly.-BDZ",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

Not if he turns out te be maneuvered by one of the serpents/dragon kids that bursts out of peoples chests in the Alien-flicks. In that case, the bounty hunter in this movie wouldn't have been the only one wise enough to know the true way of killing Jason Vorhees. A certain E. Ripley could surely think of something...The beginning of the movie is great! It feels like ""early days"" again! For the most part of the film you'll only see glimpses of the great Jason in mirrors, not the true stalker himself. No, instead others are due to do the job this time. In this movie the score actually ends 2-0 to Humanity V.S Jason! Lucky guess anyone!? Mine was 15-1 in Jason's favor...Alright, new ideas must be welcomed when it's the 9th sequel, but they have already tried the idea of putting the main hero character on the bench, while others do all the fun. Didn't work then, doesn't work now.Great to see Kane Hodder's true nature, when he's not the man behind the mask.Lousy attempt to end this horror series.

259,Nine18Pictures,Hell is right,3,2 October 2002,"Jason Goes to Hell opens very cool.  Then, some army guys blow him up. Afterwards, the black guy from ""Rocky V"" takes a bite out of the heart, which transfers Jason into the black guy.  The rest of the film is crap. It's good to make fun of.  The BIGGEST screw-up in the whole hellish mess is during the TV report about the dead coroner and the missing coroner and the dead security guards.  The picture that the TV shows of the dead coroner is just a STILL (?) from the scene with the coroners.  I repeat: It's a freeze frame still from the movie, not an actual photo.  God, this installment sucks.  It's worth owning because it IS a part of the series and the scene where the chick gets macheted just before she pops is weirdly amusing, but in all this movie is BAD BAD LEROY CRAP!",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
260,TheSlasherReviewer,Jason Better Go to Hell After This Movie,1,25 March 2012,"I recently picked up the VHS of this movie yesterday for three bucks at a thrift store. I'm sad to say that I was ripped off.There really is nothing good that came from the this movie. It is just another sad attempt to make more money on another horror franchise. The acting is pretty bad, the dialog was cheesy and terrible, but what I hated most was the music playing throughout the entire film. I don't know why they had this weird piano, and synth music, but it drove the cheese factor of this movie through the roof. It drove me nuts, and made me feel like I was watching an old Goosebumps. Not only that, but I was also bored. Halfway through, I was seriously considering turning it off.None of the characters in the film were likable at all. I wanted Jason to slaughter all of them so I wouldn't have to sit through anymore bad acting and cheesy dialog.I won't even bother explaining the plot because it'll get me more upset, but if you're a fan of Jason movies, especially bad cheesy ones with annoying characters, and idiotic music, then give it a shot. Otherwise, stay away from this movie.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
261,thekingofplain,One of the worst films in cinema history,1,19 April 2005,"I just watched this last night and I have to say it is worse than I remember. This is a shameful film to be included in this series. The scenes just do not make any sense. I'll admit that there are times when I just can't help myself... I have to grab a black beating heart and munch it down, but in this case, there just wasn't any motivation that I could see. Oh, wait - the evil in Jason's heart called out to the coroner... right. Strike that. This is really bad. Really. I would say that the film looks as if it was written by high schoolers, but that would be an insult. Stay far away unless you just want to watch the complete series. Some of the deaths are good, but they couldn't save the film. If you are a fan of the Evil Dead films, you will notice something interesting, but it will be the most interesting thing about the film.You could make a better film if you strapped a rolling camera on to a wiener dog for an hour and a half.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
262,Dreality,Jason Goes to Hell,1,21 March 2006,"People like to say that Friday the 13th Part V-A new beginning was the worst film of the series, but I'd have to disagree. This was by far the worst of all the films in my book. It made Part VIII look like a classic and that was a piece of garbage. The one thing this film did was miss the buck. It had an opportunity to do something different. They never explored the ending Part 8 left for them, they simply decided to ignore it all together. The lack of Jason in this film simply made it boring. When he finally did appear Jason simply appeared lethargic and tired. I would love it if the producers could return Jason to his pre zombie days like he was in The Final Chapter. Those were the days when Jason was mean and scary. Overall I'd have to say New Line's first attempt at a Jason film was a total disaster",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

I was really anxious when i was going to watch is buy the first time, it really surprised me with things the others movie didn't have like Jason going body by body.The part i really enjoyed was when Jason got into the police station and defeated all the cops, then when he got into the restaurant and everybody was shooting him. Ja JA JA!! But no bullet can stop him.I really liked it, now i can wait for the new movie of Friday the 13th: ""I hope it to come this year"".

Now I know that we are barely able to actually see Jason throughout the film but in the precious time that he is on screen, Kane Hodder is just excellent.

The movie is not even about Jason first off. Its about a bunch of r ed Jason specs traveling from person to person causing them to kill. This is pretty much a plot cliché of the other Friday movies. Horny teens, most of them die one guy one girl left with a stupid ending. I could not finish watching this movie but I have seen enough to know what happened because I've seen it all in previous Friday movies. Exactly what I predicted was correct. Lets have sex where Jason can see us then gut us to death. What was up with that scene with the baby. A guy takes the baby and she shows no concern. Then he throws a knife like 50 feet away and she automatically catches it, then to top off the stupidity a static type glow goes pass her hand.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

I did enjoy Jason x, Jason vs. Freddy and also the remake, but this one was nothing like the previous sequels Jason was hardly in the movie, the plot sucked, Jason's makeup effects looked stupid to me, and in this one Jason has a sister, was she born from Jason's mother who knows they give no explanation on to where she came from, and also why did Jason have the book from the evil dead series, very low budget movie seemed liked to me, it seemed like they paid more money to make the previous movies than they did in this one.Stupid ending but i did like when Freddy's hand reached from hell and grabbed Jason's mask underneath to promote the Freddy vs. Jason movie they took awhile to make.I wouldn't recommend this Friday movie to fans.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

(I actually liked parts 8 and X).Which is kind of what you get when the first 8 were by Paramount, all running in a continuous storyline, and then this is the first one done by New Line, and they totally crap all over the character and the franchise by changing the storyline/characters/ and continuity.Part 9 has absolutely nothing to do with the movies before and/or after, which is a huge mistake by the movies' makers, kinda crapping all over the fans. This is a big problem.Also, Jason himself is only in 2 scenes: he's in the beginning for like 5 minutes, BEFORE the opening credits... then doesn't return until over an HOUR later, for like 10 minutes. OK. I paid to see JASON. this didn't deliver.crap, crap, crap. i mean, i guess if you're a big jason/Friday fan, it's worth watching at least once.. but don't go in expecting much. it's almost like the script was for another horror movie indefinitely, (with the body-switching and the hellbaby and the curse and the dagger, etc) and they just changed some of the names and slapped the 'JASON' logo on it to make it a part of this franchise.I recommend Freddy vs. Jason or even Jason X over this crap.

I liked the whole Jason being a demon element in Jason Goes To Hell, Jason design is what someone who was drown in toxic waste would look like, the acting is surprising good, and the kills are the most goriest kills in any Friday film.Overall not a bad film, only thing that bugged is the soundtrack is little repetitive.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

Now when it comes to the Friday the 13th movies you don't expect much especially with all the really awful sequels. This was a toss up between this complete and total atrocity on celluloid. There's movies so bad they're funny but this was a movie that was just plain godawful. This sequel apparently jason can suddenly be reincarnated over and over again and beyond that it probably will cause brain damage to try and waste any further brain cells on trying to understand the pointlessness of what was written by a sadistic 12 year old pervert.

Throw in a few pointless in-jokes and you have somthing which quite frankly would have been more effective if it had been made by monkey's with crayons.(and did i mention how boring it is?)But then again what did i expect from friday the thirteenth part NINE.I will conclude by manically repeating my summary:so very bad, so very bad, so very bad, so very bad, so very bad, so very bad, so very bad .........",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
277,cinemaguy21,Haters Take a Machete to the Face,7,27 October 2006,"I think its a travesty how this movie has taken so much heat compared to the rest of the series. While I love this kind of camp, every character, plot and film in this series has largely been interchangeable with the others.Fast forward to 1993 and we have a film that attempts to add innovations like pop horror references to the films Evil Dead and Nightmare on Elm Street without resorting to half-baked comedy (I'm looking at you Freddy). We have a film that updates Jason's by-now clichéd features to a more sublime grotesque, looking like a serial killer would look if he ignored hygiene for 20 years during his hacking and slashing hayday.The plot makes a marked improvement from ""I know they're all gonna die, but how?"" to ""What the hell could possibly kill Jason? What does the Necronomicon have to do with it (merely a mystery in the mythology)? Jason has family? and We're finally going to get some friggin' resolution here?"" Come on people: Jason X should have been shunned by any self-respecting fan after all the promos claimed this to be ""The Final Friday"". Plus finished it in what I considered to be a climactic finale. Instead you crawled back on your knees like the creatures of habit that you are, always willing to settle for another broken promise and failed expectation from a marketable franchise. Note: Let's be fair though, none of us could have helped wanting to see Freddy Vs. Jason.To the creators of this movie, I give you props. Besides most of the people on IMDb who hated this movie either don't like the slasher genre or can't friggin' spell ""slasher genre"".",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
278,kowgurl,Are you kidding me??,2,1 November 2006,"Jason goes to hell is a joke. Honestly. The whole time I was watching, I just stared at the screen in disbelief. F13-7 was stretching it a little bit...8 was a little better but not by much...but JGTH was just ridiculous. At least the rest of the movies followed a central storyline and kept the history of the series intact. JGTH didn't bother to consider anything that had happened in the past. The movie completely disregarded the fact that Jason had been ""killed"" in the last movie. How was he resurrected?? (They didn't in JasonX either, but at least that movie made sense and kept me entertained). It also brought in this whole theory that Jason could only be killed by a Voorhees...where did that come from?? And what's this history with Duke that keeps getting mentioned but never explained?? This movie tried to survive on its gore, but that just made it worse (a suggestion to writers: adding stupid fake looking creepy crawly monsters to your movies DOES not make it scarier...it makes your movie look ridiculous...if you would like an example, check out the corn monster in Children of the Corn:Urban Harvest!). The acting was terrible (you would think it would get better as the series moves on...not true in JGTH), the kill scenes didn't have near the effect as ones in the past (except in maybe one or two cases), Jason has this wild new history that we've never heard of before and isn't even fully explained (and no, it doesn't add to the mystery, it just makes the writers look dumb), and why is that stupid dagger so important...and what's with the tongue?? This movie just doesn't make any sense. As far as I'm concerned, it was a disgrace to the series. The absolute only redeeming factor in my mind (and I know this has been mentioned, but it deserves to be mentioned again) was the final scene with the Freddy hand. It was the only part of the movie that actually made me want to watch another one. Before that I was honestly prepared to give up on Jason, if that's the direction the next movie was going to take. So to those of you who haven't seen it, I would absolutely suggest that you just skip it. It has nothing to do with the rest of the series and will really do nothing more that confuse you and make you angry...at least that's what it did for me.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

There probably a bottle of nerds here that voted 1 because OH A NAKED LADY!I give the movie 7.

That said, this film is the best in the entire series. While renting this you can assume it will be crap, yet this entry surpasses the previous installments. Primarily on directing, done with skilled tracking shots and slow motion action sequences. The plot was taken directly from Cravens ""SHOCKER"" New Line's horrible follow up to Nightmare. Here, instead of a brambly Jason lumbering like a annoyed old drunk sailor decapitating kids. His spirit is exchanged through different bodies via a black, shivers like penis. (SHIVERS, CRONENBERGS HORROR SEX ROMP) It's corny, gay and laughable yet quite entertaining. The Friday movies have always been flaccid forms of entertainment, yet this one manages to have fun in the Raimi tradition of campy horror. I recommend it over all the entries.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
282,Banana_On_The_Table,Nah,2,3 July 2019,"This is not a Friday the 13th movie.I'm a huge F13 fan, but this movie is so bad. Some people complain about Jason not being in the movie. I don't have a problem with that since I kinda like Part 5. That movie had problems and could have been good, but didn't quite work.
This though, oh man... It's not even ""So bad it's good"". I was bored as hell watching this one (no pun intended).A Friday movie are usually fun and entertaining to watch, but this one had nothing to add except some stupid lore that doesn't belong in the Friday the 13th universe. Before this Jason was just this misunderstood character seeking revenge for his dead mother, but now he's suddenly a demon from hell???
It's not hinted at at all in the other movies.One kill that's badass is the kill in the tent! That's the only scene that's entertaining! It's so good that I'm disappointed that's it's in this movie and not in one of the other Friday movies.Remember to watch the uncensored version! Because the censored version sure enough takes all the fun parts out of this movie..",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
283,Libertine_Wolf,To hell with this.,5,11 April 2010,"In the first five minutes Jason chases a victim into a clearing where he is hit by flood lights. The FBI doesn't even bother demanding his surrender. They just jump out of the wood work and blow him up.Why is that and the scenes following so... well, refreshing? Why do people keep going to Crystal Lake? Why is it we don't ever see Jason's effects on the world? Why does some one who lives in that area need to be told the ""Legend of Jason Voorhees!"" Do the English, a hundred years after the fact, need to be told the ""Legend of Jack the Ripper!""? He's killed 80+ people over the course of the series by the ninth one. People in Russia would know who he is.Here, not only does every one know who Jason is, they know his modus operandi so well the FBI manages to use one of their own to bait him into an irresistible trap and blow him to bits.Following this is an even bigger shake up. A sequence that might well be both the most awesome scene of the movie and, when you consider its implications, one of the worse. A coroner is performing an autopsy of Voorhees becomes utterly fixated on and disturbed by his heart when it starts beating again. He struggles with a dark impulse, then in a savage moment of utter insanity EATS the heart. The problem is he is now possessed by Jason Voorhees in a blatant rip off of The Hidden.In the sequence following... how did some one get clearance to take those photos after all the secrecy bullocks? Also why is every one sure it's Jason when his body parts are... totally still there? We are then introduced to bounty hunter Crieghton Duke, some cross between Shaft, John Wayne and Obiwan Kenobi. His character is colorful, intriguing. Then our main character, a nerdy guy in his mid twenties named Steven Freeman who has a certain charm to him and is the former (Boyfriend? Husband?) of Diana's daughter. Diana is a- wait. Liked. His character. Liked these characters. Colorful. Intriguing. Charm.These characters are likable and identifiable? They aren't one dimensional stereotypes? We fear for them? So this one wants to play with the big kids? I'm game. That means I'm going to start holding the acting and characters to higher standards too. While the acting is good in some places it also slumps in others. There are some off key moments between Diana and Steven right off the bat where the dialogue could have stood a bit more polish, both of the characters seem a bit too nervous.Steven picks up some hitchhikers and one of them immediately starts flirting, inviting him to come with them, then kisses him. Wow, that was fast. Normal for Friday but any where else? I don't dispute the existence of whores, but this one has a serious nerd fetish if she was hot to trot for him after a brief car ride. Or maybe she just likes guys who tell tasteless jokes.Duke... no. THE DUKE is masterfully played by Williams and I instantly was endeared to his character. He's a magnificent bastard. Sadly there's no real fight between him and Jason at the end, which felt disappointing.Did I mention Jason is into bondage now? That isn't the only bizarre fetish in this movie... the rebirthing scene... I don't know rather to laugh or cry.The story itself is honestly pretty ridiculous. Jason kills Diana and Steven takes the blame. In jail, he meets up with The Duke who was jailed for harassing Diana earlier. He goes into an hilarious version of plot exposition mode where Steven loses the use of his hand. In order for Jason to reclaim his former more powerful body he needs to possess a blood relative of his. Diana was his sister and Jessica his niece. He may only be killed by a Voorhees wielding- wait for it- a magic dagger.Yeah.I understand The Duke has been tailing Jason for some time but how the hell does he know all this? How is it possible for no one in this kind of small hick town to know Diana is Jason's sister? If only one of these people could kill him why didn't Jason kill THEM a long time ago seeing as they live in the town right next to his hunting grounds? Also MAGIC DAGGER?! I know we want an entirely new direction here but what does this mean in regards to all the other films? Was Jason undead all along? That might explain disappearing wounds but... is Jason the slug thing or was he simply possessed by the slug thing himself? This really just goes from one extreme to another, going from the bored uninspired films of the past to this one which almost goes on like a teenage fan-fiction writer with ADD.To be fair, the magic dagger is the one from the Evil Dead series. You also get a cameo of the Necronomicon and Freddy Krueger.I don't think I need to go into how poorly this was received by fans. They went a bit over board with the 'bold new direction'. There is still boobs and blood, in fact those three campers I told you about end up in a classic Friday situation so you can't complain those elements are completely gone. Also, people MELT in this movie when Jason leaves their bodies! Overall this is a film that made an admirable attempt to liven the series and while it failed spectacularly it had a little fun in the process. There's a lot to love and a lot to hate but it balances out fairly well. If you hate every other film in the series this -might- be one to give a try.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

I really like this movie it's scary for one and the acting is excellent for a horror film. John D LeMay and Steven Williams are awesome maybe the best characters from any other Jason film. This film's deaths are only rivaled by some of the things I've seen in the Final Destination films they are that good.

There are some great and original effects, and indeed, more of an independent feel to this than any other in the series.If you watch this hoping for a return to the classic, then you may be disappointed, but as a film of the age, I found very enjoyable to watch, even more so after that ghastly Manhattan episode.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday

How many times can we see Jason cut up horny teenagers at Camp Crystal Lake before it gets old fast? And yes, there are horny teenagers in this movie. For those of you that like a little spice in your horror flicks, this one delivers. Get the unrated DVD for the best parts. As for the story: Wow, there is one! Jason gets killed in a very cool ambush by federal agents at the beginning of the movie and the mortician performing his autopsy becomes Jason.

I thought Part VII was too over the top with a telekinetic girl, but the whole body-switching approach was ridiculous even for the most hardcore Friday fan. If Jason can ""wear other peoples' bodies the way you and I wear clothes"" as is said in the film, then why didn't Jason use this power in any of the previous installments? Also, by following this format, the audience is basically just watching a generic slasher flick as ""Jason"" only appears in the film for about fifteen minutes. It was especially sad to think that critics had been lambasting the franchise for years and this bomb just gave them all the more ammunition. After it was all said and done, I was very disappointed to think that this may indeed be the ""final Friday,"" because to end the series with this load of trash would be desecration.

So it tries something different with the story. So what? Is that a bad thing? It's actually a welcome change from the paint-by-numbers ""action"" from the previous 8 films.And anybody who is going to crack on this movie for being ""unrealistic""... whoa now.

289,gingerbreadpenguin,The Worst of the Series,3,27 January 2006,"This was to be the last Jason Vorhees movie made. All I can say is thank God they didn't actually stop here. Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday had left a bad taste in the mouths of Jason fans for a good 8 years before ""Jason X"" was released to help us wash it down. Jason Goes To Hell is a bit like the cringe-worthy Nightmare on Elm Street 6; All of a sudden our anti-hero has living relatives (and a family home) never mentioned in any of the other 8 movies. Likewise, the main plot concept would feel more at home in a schlocky Ed Wood film, attributing Jason's supernatural abilities to demons, or some such tripe. Along with bad special effects, uninventive kills and the fact that Jason's appearance has taken a turn for the aesthetically worse, no effort has been made whatsoever to tie this movie in to the Friday the 13th series we know and love. On top of that, Jason doesn't even got to hell. What a dupe! Personally I was unable to suspend my disbelief for more than 5 minutes; nearly every event in the script seems unlikely, unbelievable and completely contrived in the context of the rest of the series. This is, by far, the worst Friday yet. Unless you're a dedicated fan and want to see every single movie, ""Avoid Jason Goes To Hell"" like the plague!",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
290,jester4444,Not as bad as people make it out to be +Kinda Spoiler+,7,29 June 2006,"The movie, I'm not gonna lie to ya, IS the worst of the series.. that I'VE seen so far anyways. It doesn't really fit in with the other ones at all to tell you the truth... it's way too... voodoo. That book she finds in the Voorhees house is oddly reminiscent of the Necromicon from Evil Dead too. But anyways, it was kinda (REALLY) corny, but it's not by any means a bad movie, it's enjoyable. They had a bit more gratuitous nudity (nothing wrong there ;), which didn't make up for the crappy (TERRIBLE) plot... it had some interesting deaths though... especially the chick that got impaled and torn in half, unlike the usual * Jason pops up, GASP!, machete..aaaaaand dead * But anyways, it was kinda like ""Jason Meets The Body Snatchers"", not worthy of being a Friday The 13th, but still an interesting movie. Painfully stereotypical voodoo plot aside, it was an entertaining.... experience. Oh yeah... and the giant fuzzy hands coming up from Hell to steal Jason killed the mood for me... at least I know where the Teletubbies ended up now... serves em right.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
291,codydotson,Always Brings Back Sentimental Feelings,8,6 April 2019,"I love the Friday the 13th series and have since I was a child. They used to be scary then but now mostly good for a bit of gore, nudity, and of course a laugh. They can be a bit cheesey but it was always intentional as with most of the great low budget 70s- early 90s horror flicks. Definitely don't make any good ones anymore especially these remakes of Jason, Freddy, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
292,justinlee-1,Just plain dumb,1,3 February 2006,"I'm really into the Jason movies. I've seen about six of them so far, and this one was a disaster. Don't see this movie. it sucks. it makes no sense. its kind of like starship troopers. the first one was kick ass and then they came out with the straight to DVD starship troopers two. with aliens going in your body and crap. Jason goes to hell is not worth a penny. the best part is the end when Freddys glove appears at the end of the movie. kicking off Freddy vs. Jason. why they made this movie before Jason X is beyond me. Plus jason makes sounds in this one. HE Doesn't MAKE ANY NOISES. what the heck is up with that. he grunts. i cannot tell you how much this movie sucks. do not waste your time on this two million dollar film.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
293,osuna_la,Boring,3,13 March 2019,"It was disappointing to not see Jason at all. I loved Jaon,s aesthetic at the beginning of the film, but I lost interest in the movie as soon as Jason disappeared from the scene.",Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday
