0,SnoopyStyle,must be taken as camp,6,20 July 2015,"Billie Jean (Helen Slater) lives in a Texas trailer park with her brother best friend Binx (Christian Slater). Local bully Hubie picks on them. He steals Binx's scooter and then trashes it while beating up Binx. Detective Ringwald (Peter Coyote) brushes Billie Jean off. She goes to get the money herself. Hubie's dad lures her upstairs and tries to rape her. Meanwhile Binx finds a gun in the cash register. The gun goes off accidentally and Hubie's dad is shot. Billy Jean, Binx, friends Putter (Yeardley Smith) and Ophelia (Martha Gehman) go on the run and become legends as she fights for ""fair is fair"". They break-in and befriends horror-fan weirdo Lloyd (Keith Gordon) who volunteers to be their hostage. He turns out to be the son of District Attorney Muldaur (Dean Stockwell).It is fun and energetic. It's not subtle. Richard Bradford is being a super villain. There is a lot of silliness going on. It has no believability. Yeardley Smith is ridiculous. But it's a fun campy 80s movie and there are stuff to like about it. Helen Slater and Peter Coyote are great at their roles. It's no surprise that they're the only two reasonable characters in the whole movie. Although Helen Slater striking that pose is hilarious. The movie tries to say something about girl empowerment with the Joan of Arc theme but the movie can't be taken seriously.",The Legend of Billie Jean
1,claudio_carvalho,The Modern Joan of Arc,8,28 April 2017,"In Texas, the hot teenager Billie Jean Davy (Helen Slater) lives with her brother Binx (Christian Slater) and her mother in a trailer. In a hot day, she rides with Binx on his scooter to swim in a lake. However, the bully Huble Pyatt (Barry Tubb) steals the scooter with his friends. Billie Jean goes to the police but Detective Ringwald (Peter Coyote) does not give much attention to her. When Binx tries to retrieve his scooter, Huble trashes the scooter and beats Binx up. Billie Jean goes with her brother Binx and her friend Ophelia (Martha Gehman) to the store of Huble's father Pyatt (Richard Bradford) with the repair bill and the old man lures Billie Jean and brings her to his office. Then he harass and tries to rape her. Meanwhile Binx finds a gun in the cash register and her accidentally shoots Pyatt. Billie Jean, Binx. Ophelia and their teenage neighbor Putter (Yeardley Smith) flee from Ophelia's car. They meet the teenager Lloyd (Keith Gordon), who is the estranged son of the D.A. Muldaur (Dean Stockwell), he proposes to be their ""hostage"" so that the runaway teenagers could get some money for their journey. When Billie Jean watches Otto Preminger 's ""Saint Joan"" at Lloyd's television, she cuts her hair short and makes a video with her explanation and demands, becoming and icon worshiped by the teenagers. Meanwhile Detective Ringwald finds the mess, he realizes that he should have listened to Billie Jean and tries to fix the situation.""The Legend of Billie Jean"" is a super-cult movie from the 80's and maybe Helen Slater's best film in her career. The plot entwines action and drama and it is delightful to watch. In the 80's, many viewers believed that Helen Slater and Christian Slater were siblings since they have the same last name. The story of a wronged teenager that cuts her hair in Joan of Arc's style and becomes an idol of the youth has not aged and is still wonderful to watch. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""A Lenda de Billie Jean"" (""The Legend of Billie Jean"")",The Legend of Billie Jean
2,Woodyanders,Helen Slater excels in this sturdy 80's cult favorite,8,29 October 2014,"Feisty lower-class teenager Billie Jean (a strong and charismatic performance by Helen Slater) and her brother Binx Davy (a solid and likable Christian Slater in his film debut) become celebrity fugitives after a dispute between affluent jerk Hubie (a perfectly obnoxious turn by Barry Tubb) and his no-count father Mr. Pyatt (a splendidly slimy portrayal by Richard Bradford) about Hubie trashing Binx's scooter gets out of hand.Director Matthew Robbins keeps the engrossing story moving along at a quick pace, vividly captures the humid atmosphere of rural Texas, and manages to prevent the potentially campy story from degenerating into totally laughable kitsch. The astute script by Rick Rosenthal and Lawrence Konner offers a pointed and powerful social commentary on how the rich exploit and push around the poor and disenfranchised, the way the media can mold someone into a martyr, and the basic necessity to see that justice gets served after something wrong goes initially unpunished. This film further benefits from fine acting by a tip-top cast: Yeardley Smith as excitable third wheel Putter, Keith Gordon as the helpful Floyd, Martha Gehman as loyal gal pal Ophelia, Peter Coyote as sympathetic cop Lt. Ringwald, and Dean Stockwell as Flloyd's estranged bigwig politician father Muldaur. However, it's Slater who really keeps this picture on track: She looks absolutely stunning with close-cropped hair and brings a fierce conviction and winning sense of pure integrity to the character of Bille Jean that makes her real easy to root for and side with as she becomes a symbol of defiant rebellion and female empowerment to the adolescent public at large. Jeffrey L. Kimball's slick cinematography provides a neat polished look. Craig Safan's moody score and the pumping rock soundtrack both hit the stirring spot. A super cool movie that's deserving of its avid fan following.",The Legend of Billie Jean
3,moonspinner55,It seems satisfied with being only Fair when it could have been much more...,5,23 May 2014,"Teenage siblings in Texas are wanted by the police after one of the kids shoots and wounds an auto mechanic--this following a sexual proposition on Billie Jean (who is nearly raped) and the beating of her brother by a group of peers, which the cops have shrugged off. Youthful rebellion on a low-budget. Screenwriters Mark Rosenthal and Lawrence Konner occasionally have tongue-in-cheek, and display a curious penchant for oddball character names like Binx and Putter, but too often they fall back on melodrama (which helps to derail the entire final reel). Despite constantly flashing her bright, nice-girl smile, Helen Slater's Billie Jean is a convincing rabble-rouser until the script gives her too much to handle. The film has a misshapen feel, with yahoo comedic moments and a production imbued with an inappropriate candy-coated sheen. Far from being a teen-variant of ""The Sugarland Express"", which may have been fascinating, the movie instead takes the low road. It is unambitious and amateurish--and seems perfectly satisfied with being both. ** from ****",The Legend of Billie Jean
4,wes-connors,The Yellow Haired of Texas,2,16 December 2007,"Texas blondes Helen Slater (as Billie Jean) and Christian Slater (as Binx) go out for a ride on his motor scooter; they meet some local toughs, who show unwelcome interest in Ms. Slater. Mr. Slater douses the head punk with his vanilla drink, and the Slaters take off for a swim. While the Slaters take a dip, the toughs steal Christian's scooter, which they later trash. Helen goes to the head tough's dad, and demands just over $600.00; or, the value of her little brother's scooter. Then, oops, the punk's father is accidentally shot. The Slaters go on the lam; soon, they hook up with Keith Gordon (as Lloyd), to provide a love interest for Helen. They become famous rebels for the youth set, adopting the motto ""Fair Is Fair"". ""The Legend of Billie Jean"" starts out fun; but, it is brought down by a truly wretched finale.",The Legend of Billie Jean
5,sunwarrior13,A Spunky Performance By Slater,7,24 January 2020,"The Legend of Billie Jean is a 1985 American drama film, directed by Matthew Robbins. It stars Helen Slater, Keith Gordon, Christian Slater and Richard Bradford.It tells a story about teenagers Billie Jean Davy located at Texas.It was obviously a teen melodrama with themes that deal with being a celebrity and heroism. Added to that,we also see a borderline campy movie that contains good acting such as the spunky performance by Helen Slater.By today's standards,it maybe dated and somewhat a guilty pleasure movie.But nevertheless,it remains fun to watch especially with one familiar with Helen Slater,who was the lead star of the 1984 movie ""Supergirl"".",The Legend of Billie Jean
6,jotix100,Joan of Arc of the Texas Rivera,7,27 January 2005,"This is an excellent movie for young people, in general. It shows how one has to fight for one's principles, as it's the case with Billie Jean, a girl living in the Texas coastal town of Corpus Christi. As directed by Matthew Robbins, this film will never cease to amaze.After he brother's motorcycle is trashed by a group of rough teenagers. Billie Jean wants the father of the boy who gave a beating to her brother, to pay for the repair of the bike. This is a man who, knowing where Billie Jean comes from, tries to abuse the girl sexually. He doesn't know who he is messing with.The movie deals with the way Billie Jean goes about in getting her revenge against all odds. In doing so, she becomes an instant celebrity to the young population in the area, who easily identify with the wronged girl and make her a folk hero.Helen Slater makes a sunny appearance as Billie Jean. She is a girl who believes in justice, and demands it from the man who wanted to take advantage of her. A young, blond Christian Slater is Binx, the young brother. Peter Coyote is also seen as the chief of police who Billie Jean goes to present her complaint, but doesn't have enough sense to pay attention to her.Never underestimate a determined woman who is wronged. Whoever thinks otherwise will probably get his own Billie Jean to her point.",The Legend of Billie Jean
7,Scarecrow-88,"The Scarecrow reviews ""The Legend of Billie Jean""",8,17 August 2006,"Many might use labels describing this movie as ""hokey"" or ""preposterous"" or ""manipulative"", but one thing I believe is achieved in this little cult fave is Helen Slater's terrific performance as the female heroine who gets her revenge against scumbag Pyatt(Richard Bradford). It's interesting that this film works off a basic premise about a young woman who will have to take it to the road in order to get $608 for her brother's(Christian Slater in his first film, and he really shows promise at such an early age)motor scooter being damaged by Pyatt's son Hubie(Barry Tubb). The film makes Pyatt completely evil and greedy milking Billie Jean's ""Joan of Arc"" image for all it's worth. He's a sign of corrupt greed, pure and simple and seems, in this film, to merely be a vile scum-of-the-earth with no soul. Helen Slater, on the other hand, brings effortless grace, strength, dignity, sexiness, and charisma to her role as Billie Jean. You can see why this movie has a little following because Billie Jean is a representation of poor, but rather happy neighborhoods while Pyatt, and especially Hubie, represent the very smell of greenbacks. What is damaging, I believe, is that there is hardly any room for a grey area in this film. Billie Jean is good. Pyatt is evil. Peter Coyote, a very fine and sadly underrated actor, brings a level-headedness and understanding to his role as a cop trying to stop the madness, but constantly dealing with Pyatt and his ideas of not paying the money that is rightfully owed to Billie Jean. The film works well as a road movie and the young cast is so good, we love watching them together on-screen. Yeardley Smith steals the film as Putter, whose foul mouth and overeating provide much humor. Putter is the type to just speak out loud what most might keep to themselves. Martha Gehman plays Ophelia, simple and honest driver of the car. She is pretty much the one Billie Jean can truly depend on when things tend to get chaotic. Then there Keith Gordon as the ""hostage"" who Billie Jean falls for. This is one of Gordon's finest hours(along with some good work in ""Christine"" and rather ho-hum work in ""Back to School"")and it's quite a shame the film doesn't get recognized enough for others to see how good this young cast was in this movie. Dean Stockwell turns in a supporting role as Gordon's father..their relationship is strained at best. I will admit that this particular scene where Billie Jean is called upon to ""save"" a little boy from his abusive father was rubbish, but it was a padding placed in the film showing that so many feel that this young woman is a symbol for troubled, wronged youth everywhere so perhaps it might not be hammered by critics too much. The film's ending as this statue erected by Pyatt with Billie Jean holding a gun in her hand as if she's a terrorist falls into the pit of flames that starts up accidentally when he trips over a burning candle could be considered a bit hokey as well. But, my solid rating is pretty much based on my love for Helen's phenomenal performance and the good young cast. The soundtrack really is quite good as well.",The Legend of Billie Jean
8,Hey_Sweden,We will be invincible!,7,9 November 2014,"It's easy to see why ""The Legend of Billie Jean"" would have a following almost 30 years after it was released. It's firmly on the side of its youthful protagonists, with most of the adults and upper class characters treated with a degree of contempt. A more even hand would have helped, but as it is, our young actors are good enough that one does still root for them up to a point. In fact, solid acting right down the line helps to sell this material.""Supergirl"" star Helen Slater is sexy Texan Billie Jean Davy, living with her younger brother Binx (an engaging Christian Slater, making his film debut) and mom in Corpus Christi. A run in with obnoxious rich jerk Hubie (Barry Tubb) causes Hubie to steal Binx's treasured scooter and ruin it. Billie Jean goes to Hubies' store owner father Mr. Pyatt (Richard Bradford) to ask for the $608 to repair the scooter, but circumstances get out of control, and Billie Jean and Binx become fugitives from the law, convinced that the authorities will never buy their side of the story. They become rebel heroes to kids everywhere, and Billie Jean is inspired to cut her hair short, Joan of Arc style.Helen Slater is quite good as the reluctant pop culture icon. Co-star Keith Gordon is fun as the slightly eccentric young man who becomes sympathetic to her cause. Bradford is perfectly slimy as the unrepentant elder. Martha Gehman and Yeardley Smith offer solid support as the gal pals who join the Davys on the road. Peter Coyote is good as the understanding cop, ditto Dean Stockwell as Gordons' attorney father. Look for John M. Jackson ('JAG') and Caroline Williams (""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part 2"") in small roles.Also helping to make this palatable is the catchy rock & pop soundtrack, featuring that irresistible kick ass theme song belted out by Pat Benatar.The movie does have something to say about the way that people can and will cynically capitalize on fads, and how justice isn't something that should just be reserved for adults. It's a fairly intriguing melodrama that provides a striking amount of catharsis at the end.Seven out of 10.",The Legend of Billie Jean
9,preppy-3,Has some great moments,7,16 June 2008,"Billie Jean Davy (Helen Slater) and her brother Binx (Christian Slater) are unjustly accused of shooting a man. They go on the run with two friends...but their ""crime"" gains notice and Billie Jean finds herself a modern day Joan of Arc. Teenagers everywhere help her out to find justice.This movie is maddening. It has a good story and a great message but it's constantly inter cut with chase sequences and rock videos. I realize that was done to pull in the teenage audience but it's distracting. There also seem to be huge gaps in the story (I'm assuming the film was cut). Even worse all logic is thrown out the window at the end with a few highly improbable plot twists thrown in. And the movie just ends VERY abruptly. Still I sort of like this.It's never boring and, while I complained about the rock videos, I DO love 80s music so that was fun. Also Pat Benatar's great song ""Invincible"" (which perfectly fits the movie) is played twice. Acting is almost all good. Christian Slater in his feature film debut is very good. Keith Gordon (who I usually hate) was also good. And Peter Coyote and Dean Stockwell have small roles and they're always good. As for Helen Slater--she's wooden. No emotion ever enters her face. She has one blank expression the entire movie but, I have to admit, I LIKED her! She's very attractive and when she cuts her hair she's just unbelievably beautiful. So, one one hand, I find her acting terrible, but, on the other hand, I love her! Go figure. This was a bomb in theatres (this IS a hard film to market) but has gained a cult following on video and DVD. I recommend it with reservations. It has a good message that really becomes muddled by the end, but it was great to see the 80s fashions and hear the songs again. I give it a 7.",The Legend of Billie Jean
10,zardoz-13,"""Fair is Fair,"" but ""Billie Jean"" Is Above-Average",7,7 December 2013,"""Corvette Summer"" director Matthew Robbins wrote and helmed Helen Slater's second big-screen movie, the above-average road epic ""The Legend of Billie Jean,"" about a blonde Texas teenager from a trailer park who becomes a highly-sought after fugitive after several guys stole her motor scooter from her little brother and vandalized it. Fifteen-year old Christian Slater plays Binx, the brother of Billie Jean (Helen Slater of ""Supergirl"") in this 1980s era who embarks on a journey of hardship as they dodge the law. When Billie Jean confronts the villainously mustached Pyatt (Richard Bradford of ""The Milagro Beanfield War"") whose reckless son Hubie (Barry Tubb of ""Top Gun"") damaged their scooter, she has to ward off a rape attempt. It seems that Pyatt is willing to pay Billie for the damages if she will accompany him upstairs. Fleeing from him, she descends from the room above the store and finds Binx has removed a revolver from Pyatt's cash register. Pyatt threatens Binx and Binx shoots him in the shoulder by accident. The entire state of Texas scrambles after Billie Jean, and she manages to not only elude them but recreate herself as a media icon by cutting her hair and emerging as look-alike Joan of Arc. She gets the idea one evening while watching the Otto Preminger classic movie ""Saint Joan"" (1957) with Jean Seberg cast as Joan. There is a wonderful scene when Detective Ringwald (Peter Coyote of ""Sphere"") is informed by one of his men that they have captured Billie. Actually, they have captured a quartet of girls with shorn coifs claiming to be the fugitive in a riff on the Kirk Douglas slave saga ""Spartacus."" Robbins co-scripted the Spielberg chase thriller ""The Sugarland Express"" and comparisons between the two are inevitable. The kids take a hostage, Lloyd (Keith Gordon of ""Christine"") who uses his videotape camera to shoots videos of Billie proclaiming her slogan ""Fair is Fair."" Actually, ""The Legend of Billie Jean"" is more than fair, and Helen Slater is delectable as the eponymous heroine. Rock star Pat Benatar hated this movie, but her song ""Invincible"" appears in it and adds to its message about wronged youth. Richard Bradford makes an evil villain who exploits Billie. A memorable moment occurs near the conclusion when Billie sets fire to Pyatt's canvas tent store selling posters of Billie Jean. In this instance, a towering statue of Billie Jean catches fire in a riff of ""Saint Joan."" The ending with our heroine and her brother in the snow-swept north is amusing. Binx spots a snow scooter reminiscent of the motor scooter that they were riding at the outset of the film. Yeardley Smith is fun to watch as Billie's friend who has her first period in the station wagon that they use to elude a carbine wielding truck driver. Clocking in a 96 minutes, ""The Legend of Billie Jean"" qualifies as entertaining with strong performances.",The Legend of Billie Jean
11,FlashCallahan,Fair is fair.........Y'all......,6,2 August 2014,"Texas teen Billie Jean Davy, is caught up in a fight for justice. She is usually followed and harassed around by local boys, who, one day, decide to trash her brother's scooter for fun. The boys' father refuses to pay them back the price of the scooter. The fight takes the teens around the state and produces an unlikely hero......This is a really weird movie, and being a huge fan of the eighties, and never having heard of this film before its Blu Ray release, I was desperate to see what Supergirl did next.And here's your answer, hang around with Christian Slater and get her hair cut, whilst running amok with Lisa Simpson, just trying to get the $608 owed to her brother.But the film cannot decide what demographic its aiming for. The first twenty minutes is obviously aimed at teenage boys, Slater wears next to nothing and is swimming and striking poses Madonna would be proud of.And then the second act follows, and apart from one iconic moment, when we see her in her full Sci-Fi garb, channeling Daryl Hannah in Bladerunner, it turns into some adventure film, where she helps little children who then proceed to follow her.All this for $608? But Billie would argue that it's the principle, and Peter Coyote sort of agrees with her, as he literally lets her get away with everything she is doing, but hey, that's eighties teen movies for you.It gives off an awful message, almost shouting out 'Hey Kids! Have you been wronged by an adult? Well commit some crime, the nice policeman will let you get away with it!'Its a lively film, the soundtrack is great, but Slater (the girl) proves why she never made it big, she doesn't have the screen presence, despite being good.A curioso piece, worth watching with Robin Hood: The Costner one.....",The Legend of Billie Jean
12,Wuchakk,Just kill Binx and problem solved,5,3 October 2018,"A blonde teen from Gulf Coast Texas named Billie Jean and her little brother, Binx (Helen Slater and Christian Slater), become outlaw fugitives after a mishap. Two other girls go on the lam with them wherein Billie Jean cuts her hair and, unexpectedly, becomes a cultural sensation. Keith Gordon, Peter Coyote and Dean Stockwell have peripheral roles.Being released in 1985, the movie screams mid-80's on every front. The soundtrack, for instance, includes cuts like ""Invincible"" by Pat Benatar and ""Rebel Yell"" by Billy Idol. The first act is interesting enough but the movie somehow peters out. Helen is winsome as the protagonist, but not curvy enough to hold my interest whereas Christian, who was 15 years-old during shooting, plays his role well, but his character, Binx, is just an annoying loser who seems to always do the wrong thing. If someone just mercifully shot him at the beginning there would be no problem and no film.While this one should be filed under subpar 80's teen flicks, it has a few points of interest to make it worthwhile to certain viewers.The movie runs 1 hour, 36 minutes and was shot in Corpus Christi, Texas, and nearby areas (e.g. Padre Island National Seashore); the closing Vermont sequence was shot in Colorado and obviously so.GRADE: C",The Legend of Billie Jean
13,Mr-Fusion,Crank up the Pat Benatar and bring on the social justice!,6,27 February 2017,"""The Legend of Billie Jean"" feels like it blazed the trail for other movies like ""Natural Born Killers and ""Thelma and Louise"", with Helen Slater on the run, Peter Coyote in pursuit and the news media fanning the flames. In that respect, it's a pretty lightweight movie, but it works better as a feminist rallying cry. Slater does a good job in the downtrodden hick-turned-punk fold hero role (that image of here on the movie poster speaks volumes). I think Peter Coyote and Keith Gordon carry the bulk of this, but as a teen movie with a catchy pop soundtrack, it's not bad. 6/10",The Legend of Billie Jean
14,thesar-2,"Billie, Billie, Don't You Lose Your Invincibility",7,11 May 2016,"Kidswelcome to pre-social media and pre-Jean-Claude Van Damme ball- kicks.Not only was this a perfect example of the original internet, or ""word of mouth,"" it was the good old days. I miss getting my news and stories like this story shows.Picture it. Phoenix. 1986. Thirty years ago. My sister introduced me to the legend. Billie Jean aka Joan of Arc. Back then, I loved whatever my sister did. So, since she loved this movie, so did I.Funny, this movie did make a mark on me. I literally have not seen it since that year, but this reunion of sorts on BluRay had me all misty- eyed. I cannot believe how many scenes I remembered verbatimall the way to the climax. Maybe I saw it more than a couple of times back then. Basically, the movie is pure 80s fantasy where none of this would really happen back then and especially not today. Billie Jean's brother (and the real life brother of Supergirl actress, Helen Slater, a very, VERY young Christian Slater) gets beat up just as badly as his scooter. When Billie Jean goes to collect on the money to repair the vehicle, she almost gets sexually assaulted and the pervert gets accidentally shot. Off goes the ""heroine,"" her posse and on goes the ahead-of-its-time Thelma & Louise, martyr trek.Yes, this movie is totally 80s in so many ways, but it's nice to reminisce with kids that were almost my age back then. (In my defense, I was actually younger than them in 1985.) And it's nice to see how we got information back then. Kids, as well as adults, will find it ""primitive,"" but I found it refreshing. I would much rather get ONE story from many different kids than the million that are thrown at us now. Easier to concentrate on, digest and stand behind.As stated, it's pretty much the kiddie version of Thelma & Louise. It's not to be taken as serious as that 1991 classicand if you don't take it serious, it's fun to watch. Especially if you grew up on it. Or in my case, saw it multiple of times the year it was released on ""home video.""Oh, and always remember: Fair is Fair! *fists raised****Final thoughts: No review of this movie would be complete without mentioning one of the greatest movie songs of all-time: Invincible by Pat Benatar. That song will live with me forever. Sure, I really did like this movie (despite all the fantasy/never-could-happen elements,) but that song will always bewell, yeahINVINCIBLE.",The Legend of Billie Jean
15,insomniac_rod,Guilty pleasure!,7,20 May 2009,"I haven't seen this movie in probably 15 years but the memories are fond and I must say that as a young boy I had a blast with it.This is the typical movie that will make you feel powerful when it comes about friendship, adventures, and most of all, revelry.Billie Jean's gang was likable and that helps a lot because you actually care for the party and feel worried for them. Also, the correct selection of actors was great. Yeardley Smith, Christian Slater and his sister carry the movie completely on their back.The situations are very emotional, fun, entertaining, and most of all, interesting.Keep in mind that the movie is based on a very popular character on American culture.I caught it on HBO and I hope to watch it soon.",The Legend of Billie Jean

Gordon (Christine) plays Lloyd, a rich boy Billie Jean finds romance with and Coyote (E.T.) plays cop, Ringwald who tries to find and help her. I grew up watching this and always liked it.

17,Captain_Couth,Revenge of the 80's: Helen Slater superstar!,7,3 March 2004,"The Legend of Billy Jean (1985) was one of your typical 80's movies. It's hopelessly dated but back in the day it was a real hoot to watch on T.V. The story is about two siblings that cross paths with some older punks. Billy Jean is the name of the main character(Helen Slater, looking good) and she tries to fight for what she believes is right ""Fair is fair!"" He brother is played by the infamous Christian Slater (sans Jack Nicholson accent). They some how come across a lecherous sleaze ball and get into all kinds of shenanigans. It has to be seen to be believed. You also get co-star appearances from Yeardly Smith (Lisa Simpson) Keith Gordon, Dean Stockwell and mondo footage from Jeanne D'Arc. You can't say you're a true fan of 80's flicks until you've seen this one.

18,RavenGlamDVDCollector,"hair is an actress's crowning glory, never cut off the hair, pleezz?",6,19 May 2016,"Began watching it years after having first seen it in 1993. Thought to myself, I had forgotten how great it is. A little event escalates, and you have these teens on the run. What a great movie. But then, as we go along, as they enter 'the haunted mansion' the wheels come off. The movie turns into a shambles. It all turns to sheet. I like Helen Slater very much, she is one cool chick, she has the loveliest hair. One complaint in the first half, she's so clearly not motivated to kick that guy in the nuts. I mean, she is not the type. She is too nice. Okay, since I want her in the part, I'm just saying that bit should have been played differently.But when the hair goes, everything flops. The androgynous look is anathema to me. All of a sudden it looks like two men kissing. Aw shucks man, why ruin (a) the movie and (b) the young oh-so-charming actress?I am well aware that the people carrying this one's banner high, are the ones who were inspired by this 'fashion statement' but the problem here is the unattractive result of chopping off a 100% wow lead girl's hair and leaving her denuded of the primary sexual attraction that matters most to an enthralled- up-till-midway viewer.Look at the flick again, all ye who hate my entry. The whole thing becomes an undisciplined mess, except for the rousing soundtrack. Yet there in the first half, it was all lovely locks and coming up roses.I am a fan of the first half. I absolutely adored Helen. SUPERGIRL was unfortunately a forgettable movie, but this was so much better... Peter Coyote was very much the ideal choice as well. And Pat Benatar's rising anthem scores full marks. It's amazing that the great hit was used in a little-known movie. Obscure cinemas must have rocked! But like I said, then they took a wrong turn. And it would take way more than $608 to fix the actress up again.",The Legend of Billie Jean
19,jfgibson73,Early 80's Drama,4,29 May 2011,"Here is a movie that is very firmly set in the early 80's involving a teenager who becomes a folk hero. As a drama, it has some entertaining moments that I couldn't help get caught up in. At the same time, I found myself fast forwarding often and taking long breaks that caused me to need several days to finish the film.The movie starts out by showing Billie and her family being picked on by the rich kids. They go to far when they beat up her brother and damage his moped. Billie goes to his father to collect the repair bill, but he tries to sexually assault her. Things get out of control, and Billie's brother shoots the man in the arm. Now Billie and her friends have to go on the run. The media picks up on the story and it starts to become a local sensation. Things get even more frenzied when Billie meets up with a sympathetic rich kid who dabbles in filmmaking. He helps her make a PSA in which she appears with short hair proclaiming ""Fair is fair!"" and once it airs, she becomes a hero with a rock star following. People want to help her and look to her for help.It seemed a little to forced the way the crowds began to back Billie Jean. The ending was also complicated, with Billie confronting the dad and telling everyone about what he did. In the process, she causes a fire that ruins lots of property, but is apparently cleared since she isn't shown going to jail for resisting arrest, the shooting, or the vandalism. I think I would recommend skipping this one.",The Legend of Billie Jean
20,vertigo_14,We've got the right to be angry!,7,6 April 2004,"Why does everyone knock the Legend of Billie Jean so much? For me, it's one of my favorite 80s teen movies. And it's a good exploration into the concept of vigilante justice as a natural response to not only a cumbersome justice system, but also a discriminatory one.Helen Slater is teenager Billie Jean, a nice girl from ""the trailers"" of Corpus Christi, Texas. When Hubie Pyat (Barry Tubbs) and some other local pranksters trash her brother Binx's (Christian Slater) motor scooter, she demands compensation. But Hubie refuses to pay and his father uses the opportunity to offer that Billie Jean trade some sexual favors to him for the cash. In the midst of her flight from the pervert, there's scuffle, and Mr. Pyat is accidentally shot. So, Billie Jean, her brother, and two friends involved in the accident, suddenly finds themselves on the run from the police. Rather than surrendering, they use their new teenage fugitive status to stage something of a protest (""fair is fair""), and Billie Jean becomes their hero and icon for teenage rebellion as well as feminism. They become the martyrs of teenagers while the adults dismiss the entire thing as a bunch of rambunctious teenagers gone out of control. So, there is political significance in the story of Billie Jean in looking at the criminal justice system (although some of the discrimination against Billie Jean such as denying her any sort of expedited compensation occurs as a result of the system not intervening at all). If Billie Jean was an adult, would she have been taken seriously? What if Billie Jean were a male? Would that change the situation. Indeed, this movie suggests that it would.In a decade filled with themes of teen angst, this one offers one story of the possibility of teen (and female) empowerment in a way that Pump Up the Volume or other movies like that did. I always thought it was a pretty good 80s movie and one that, judging by the message boards, still caters to a loyal audience as many of those long-lasting 80s movies do. Plus, as far as important 80s movie characteristic go, it's got good actors (Helen Slater, Christian Slater, Peter Cyote, and Kieth Gordon), and a good soundtrack (featuring Pat Benetar's ""Invincible"" and the Divinyls).",The Legend of Billie Jean
21,juanmuscle,101 things I learnt from the coolest chick in the world!,10,11 June 2018,"The Most important thing I learnt from the incredible tale of Billie Jean - cool red scooters are very, very, very inspirational! Especially in 1985! Secondly, if your scooter gets trashed by a bunch of unduly ruffians and unwieldy scallywags in the greater Texas expanse in the ripping 80's, and if you just happen to have a sister named Billie Jean, your in luck! Cause 80's producers will make the coolest style over content movie ever! Thirdly, a puerile Christian Slater really really really loves red scooters! and Vermont! Fourthly, in the 80's if you are a very cute blond rebelgirl on the lamb, you can go into underground dank where-houses anywhere in the greater USA expanse and meet up with tons of your fav fans, how VERY! And if you are on the lamb and a member of your seditious gang is Billie Jean, cute lil' bebe gingers can be a great asset! And if you are on the lamb and need help, don't worry if you are like Billie on any street in any state, across the country, there is someone just like you who savors your plight and is always, always ready to save you! God Bless Billie forever!",The Legend of Billie Jean
22,aesgaard41,Excellent Movie !,10,10 May 2002,"I don't understand why this movie wasn't more better received. After the Supergirl fiasco, this movie should have made Helen Slater's career. She plays a small mid-western girl with a younger brother (Christian Slater- not her real brother) constantly being harassed for being poor. When the motor bike is trashed and vandalized, she goes to the future criminal's father for the repair fee, but the guy is worst than his son. He blames her for a crime that never happened and even profits from the media coverage of her pursuit. Peter Coyote is the police investigator who believes her and sticks by her side even when a rich kid (Keith Gordon) fakes his kidnapping to follow her and irk his father (Dean Stockwell). It's a great movie and great script excelled even more by the voice of Pat Benatar. Ten stars !",The Legend of Billie Jean
23,ersinkdotcom,An example of pop and teen culture in 1985,8,2 August 2014,"The mid to late 1980s and early 1990 were the golden age of television for me. Every Summer I would go to my dad's for three to four weeks to visit. I loved hanging out with him as much as I could. However, after he went to bed around 9:00PM every night, the TV came on and the world of cable was waiting for me to ferociously engulf anything I possibly could in the late hours of the night.This period of my life molded my healthy appetite for movies about renegade robots, slashing killers, deadly monsters, troubled teens, and any number of classic actors taking pratfalls for my own pleasure. ""The Legend of Billie Jean"" just happened to hit HBO and Cinemax around the particular time I was most ready for it.When ""The Legend of Billie Jean"" was playing every few hours during the Summer of 1986, I had just embraced skateboarding culture and discovered the world of punk rock music. Helen Slater's transformation from homegrown Texan good girl to rebel outlaw really hit home for me subconsciously. Being 13, I highly doubt I put together the fact that I mirrored what I saw on the television. I was in the middle of finding my own identity at that time.There's two ways people should judge the movie. One is as an example of pop and teen culture in 1985. I would say it should get at least an ""A"" for this aspect. The second way to look at the movie is to gauge whether its message still stands up today. The recurring themes throughout the movie were ""Always stand up for yourself no matter what"" and ""Don't let people walk all over you, no matter how old you are."" I believe those principles are just as important today as they were some thirty years ago.""The Legend of Billie Jean"" is an accurate depiction of PG-13 films made for teens in the early and mid-eighties. There are a lot of kids using bad language. Helen Slater wears some skimpy clothes to attract the ""target"" audience. We also get some adult situations and violence to top it all off.",The Legend of Billie Jean
24,Beejerman,CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),8,10 March 2021,"The stage curtains open ...Back in the 80's when movies were basically one long music video with killer soundtracks, ""The Legend of Billie Jean"" was born. It followed the popular trend back then, appealing to a younger audience with songs by favorite artists. This particular movie sported a smash hit by Pat Benatar, ""Invincible (Theme from The Legend of Billie Jean)"". I loved that song growing up, so naturally, I just knew I was going to love the movie too. And I did, but for much more than the music.Billie Jean (Helen Slater) and her little brother Binx (a young Christian Slater - no real relation), get into some hot water when a boy, Hubie Pyatt, steals Binx's scooter in retaliation Billie Jean turning down his advances. Binx goes to get his scooter back and is beaten up for his trouble, and his scooter destroyed. Billie Jean goes to collect the repair costs from Hubie's father, and finds out that the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree when he also makes inappropriate advances. Binx comes in to witness the altercation, and having found a gun in the cash register, he accidentally shoots Mr. Pyatt, effectively making Billie Jean a fugitive from the law.Sounds pretty formulaic, I know. However, Helen Slater turned in a good performance, and is what really makes this film work. We follow along with Helen, Binx and two of their friends while they are on the run from the law in the Corpus Christi, Texas area. Peter Coyote plays the part of the police officer who knows the truth of the situation, and tries his best to get Billie Jean to turn herself in for her protection. Billie Jean won't give up until they get what's due to them. ""Fair is fair!""I highly recommend this film. It is straight out of the 80's and part of my generation, but I think even today's teen would enjoy watching this one. It is high on energy, pumping with music, and just a fun ride from start to finish. 8 stars out of 10.",The Legend of Billie Jean

(Appearantly, Mr. Pyatt didn't have the common sense to realize that.) I've only seen this movie just this year, but I didn't have to learn something about payback and justice by your own hands, that's been my stand for years on end. This movie also has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard, mostly due in large part to Pat Benatar's ""Invincible."" The only real flaw in this movie that I can name is that the plot's just a little on the hard-to-follow side; if nothing else, this movie was great to watch.Now for the verdict: 9 out of 10.Oh, and one more thing: Fair is fair!",The Legend of Billie Jean
27,Captain Ed,"Come on, people!",3,2 June 2000,"Thanks to the nature of HBO, et al, I have seen this movie about a half-dozen times.  I saw it when it first hit cable and as recently as last month.  It's just as laughable and ridiculous as ever.  The movie is full of one-dimensional characters.  The cop with a heart.  The parent(s) who beat their children.  The spoiled rich kid (actually, two of them).  Throw in dozens of teenagers who run an Underground Railroad, cheering on the poor kids from the trailer park while driving brand new cars and wearing expensive clothes for good measure, ridiculous dialogue, allusions to Joan of Arc (for going on the lam?) and mostly uninspired acting and you get LBJ. There are only two reasons for whatever attraction this movie had: Christian Slater and a good soundtrack.Besides Christian Slater (in rare, pre-Jack Nicholson-obsession mode), the rest of the cast is ordinary or worse.  Helen Slater is beautiful but not terribly compelling.  Peter Coyote decided to use one facial expression during the entire film.  Keith Gordon is boring as the nice rich kid. Billie Jean's two friends are parodies of deep-south trailer park denizens (and why are they the only two with back-woods accents? Helen Slater's accent is mild and Christian Slater didn't even attempt one).   Their stereotyped performances (and their parents) undercut the film's egalitarian theme.Even the source of conflict between Binx and the bad rich kid is silly; he's attracted to Binx's sister and he trashes the brother's bike?  Does that make sense?  I guess it makes as much sense as a cottage industry springing up overnight for a teenager accused of shooting someone and on the run. The funniest scene for me was when she shows up in the sewer or some type of damp, dank warehouse, and there's about a hundred or more teenagers there to give her a standing ovation.  Yeah, that's where I hung out when I was a teenager in the early 80s.  Hopefully she enjoyed the ovation -- it was the only one she got in connection with this film.If you want to see teenage rebellion movies, '80s style, I'd recommend Footloose.  The conflict is less contrived and far more believable than this movie, and the characters are more complex and interesting.",The Legend of Billie Jean
28,phillafella,"The ""Legend"" That Never Was.",5,17 May 2003,"THE LEGEND OF BILLIE JEAN is a cute film that stars Helen Slater as a Texas teenager who winds up hiding from police when her brother (played well by an unrelated Christian Slater) accidentally shoots a local businessman, and before long, she becomes the talk of the town.  The movie has a great theme song by Pat Benatar and good casting, including Yeardley Smith in a pre-Simpsons role and Keith Gordon as an independent filmmaker.  But, the movie does have its weak points.  The video statement that Helen Slater makes is sometimes just too much, and the plot is predictable.

Even every time I hear the Pat Benatar song, it takes me back to being 5 years old. It might not be an Oscar winner, but is thoroughly enjoyable.

30,BobbyT24,"Helen Slater and Pat Benatar's ""Invincible"" = Awesome 80s flick",6,20 August 2015,"I recently purchased the special edition ""Fair Is Fair"" DVD version of ""The Legend of Billie Jean"". Partly because I thought it was a fun flashback to the 80s when I thought this movie was so cutting-edge cool when I was still a teenager, partly because it had a soundtrack commentary by stars Helen Slater and Yeardley Smith. I wasn't disappointed.I will say I've watched this movie more than a few times. Each time I am kinda in awe of how blonde and stunning Helen is. She was (still is) a beautiful actress. ""City Slickers"", ""The Secret of My Success"" both cast her as the sexy co-star and for good reason. Her sexiness is without question in this movie. This is one of Christian Slater's (no relation) first movies and he's exactly what you'd expect him to be at 15 years old. Yeardley Smith is and always has been a gifted ugly duckling that is as adorable as they get. This is no different. Priceless casting.The story is fairly silly and formulaic. A teenage girl and her brother have their motor scooter trashed by some bullies. The girl goes to the bully's father and demands money for the damages. The dad is worse than the son. They struggle. An accident occurs. The kids go on the lam. Good cop who can read between the lines trails the kids like a bloodhound. Kids become famous outlaws. Big climax at the end. Standard teenage 80s stuff. And it's worth every second of screen time!!!Watching the DVD with the voice-over soundtrack by both Helen and Yeardley made me laugh out loud a few times. It was hilarious listening to these two friends banter back and forth about who did what when and where, the horrible 80s styles and hair now that they're mothers themselves, how their daughters won't even watch it out of sheer horror their mothers were rebellious teenagers (Helen - ""We're five minutes into the movie and my daughter has already left."" - funny stuff), etc... The fact Helen didn't remember the real actress' name of her own mother character in the movie (Mona Lee Fultz) tells you how raw this audio take is. No editing, just middle-age friends talking into a microphone. It's genuine and even better than this classic 80s flick by itself.The movie is dated, even ridiculous in some cases, and totally awesome (yes, an 80s term)! How can you not sing a few bars of Pat Benatar's ""Invincible"" in this fantastically cheesy movie? It's self-consciously teeny throughout. Even the adults act more like enabling or overbearing parents than real adults. It's cheerful, uplifting, cool and just plain fun to watch. The writing is irrelevant. Holes in the plot are beside the point. Sit back, slide this piece of 80s nostalgia into your DVD player, put on your headphones, pump up the volume on the headphones at all the right places, and just enjoy the experience.Billie Jean RULES!!! :-)",The Legend of Billie Jean
31,jeffman52001,Another underrated movie of the 1980's.,10,3 March 2005,"This movie is one of my favorite films of the 80's,a great story on how a person can be a hero,not intending to be.A great cast, story line and directing. I really love the songs in the movie too, great song by Pat Benatar, ""Invincible"".The movie starts out in Texas as Billie Jean Davy,played by the beautiful Helen Slater(Supergirl, The Secret Of My Success, and Parallel Lives), and her brother, Binx, played great by Christian Slater(Pump Up The Volume, Young Guns II, and True Romance)are riding a scooter and are being bothered by a fellow teen named Hubie Pyatt, played by Barry Tubb(Mask, Top Gun, and Truce), he tries to touch Billie Jean where he shouldn't, Binx dumps his milkshake on him and the take off. Later, Billie Jean and Binx go to the lake and swim, Hubie shows up and takes off with Binx's motor scooter. Billie Jean, Binx, and their friends, Putter, played by Yeardly Smith(Maximum Overdrive and The Simpsons), and Ophelia, played by Martha Behman(The Flamingo Kid, F/X, and Practical Magic), go to the police to report the scooter being stolen, Det. Ringwald, played by Peter Coyote(Jagged Edge, Heart Of Midnight, and The 4400), is a nice cop who wants to help them.Late that night,Binx goes to get his scooter and gets beat up by Hubie and his scooter is trashed by Hubie. Billie Jean and Binx go over to the place of business where Hubie Pyatt's dad, played by Richard Bradford(The Untouchables, Internal Affairs, and Hoodlum) works. Billie Jean tells Mr Pyatt what his son did to her brother's scooter and gives him the bill, he takes Billie Jean up to the upstairs part and nearly rapes her. Binx opens up the register and gets a gun in it, he accidentally shoots Mr Pyatt, and that is where things get all crazy. Billie Jean.Binx, Putter, and Ophelia become fugitives and have to hide out.They end up in a big house and hide their. The gang get a surprise when the young man name Lloyd, played superbly by Keith Gordon(Dressed To Kill, Christine, and Back To School), who lives their, scares them a little, but they become friends with Lloyd. Lloyd's father, played by Dean Stockwell(Beverly Hills Cop II,and Quantum Leap), is a Senator of the state of Texas. Lloyd gets the idea where he can play the hostage, to go along with them. Bille wants to deliver a message to the police about what has happened, Billie gets her hair cut real short.Billie's tape gets delivered to the police, she become a hero to all people, not just the teenagers. The gang get help from a lot of people, who believe them, that they are good people. The teenage girls get their hair cut short just like Billie Jean. Billie Jean has become a celebrity.This movie really shows how being a teenager is still rough but,it shows how a person has dignity, courage and humanity, the ending of the film really did show how a greedy person pays the price.I give this movie 2 thumbs up and 10/10 stars, I hope this movie will be out on DVD very soon.The songs in the film are super, ""Invincible"" by Pat Benatar is the greatest song they could bring to the theme of the movie. ""It's My Life"" by punk rocker Wendy O. Williams and the Plasmatics, and ""Rebel Yell"" by Billy Idol is another great song in this movie too.",The Legend of Billie Jean

The crazy nerd guy from Stephen King's Christine is also in the film, but this time he is sort of a good guy, who secretly wants to use his freedom & father's wealth to take advantage of young Billie Jean.To finalize this critique I'd like to add that this movie ends in a very awkwardly predictable manner -- with the symbolic burning of a large Billie Jean effigy (Joan of Ark symbolism) constructed by horny old Pyatt.

(SPOILERS),5,7 June 2002,"God, from Helen Slater's rebel Joan of Arc haircut to Pat Benatar's brilliant theme song ""Invincible,"" this movie is so-o-o self-righteous in its ""Don't doubt the children"" message that you'll almost forget that it's about kids fighting a man over a broken dirt bike.Basically, the movie now works as a trivia footnote. This was Yeardley Smith's biggest actual performance, before she became the ""voice of Lisa Simpson"" and did that cameo in ""As Good As It Gets."" Here she plays a mousy young girl who finds her own independence and her own short, rebellious haircut through her admiration of tortured teen-turned-media goddess Billie Jean (Slater). Also, Christian Slater, whom I don't think is actually related to Helen Slater, plays Billie Jean's troublesome-with-all-sorts-of-misguided-anger brother, whose dirt bike problems cause the whole movie to begin with. Keith Gordon, who played the guy who had the demon-possessed car in ""Christine"" and the guy with the demon-possessed father in ""Back to School,"" gave up on acting shortly after this and became a pretty good director.My biggest problem with this movie is that it loses its message in the course of showcasing misunderstood youth. By the time Billie Jean starts throwing money at people and they burn theme T-shirts of her in effigy, I was confused. Was the point that Billie Jean wasn't a heroine? Was the point that all she wanted was fair treatment and didn't get it? Are we to believe that this is the only way kids can be understood, if they go on some rampage and fake a kidnapping? What does the film say about kids in general? What underlying themes are we, as an audience, supposed to carry away from this film?The only thing it seems to conclude is that it's really cool and really rebellious to get a short haircut.",The Legend of Billie Jean

The movie is awesome and inspires with its deep connotations pertaining to government, society, mass rebellion, liberation, the transition from adolescence to adulthood, the coming of age and Zen. I feel the need to defend the Legend. Whoever thought LBJ lacked whatsoever in any area, obviously didn't pay ANY attention, which is required here, to understand this absolute masterpiece and its grand design. None of the characters in this movie are shallow and each is clearly representative of a certain degree of universal transcendence. The Legend of BJ is really a secret blueprint for those who know the truth and kept an open mind.This is one of the best rebel movies in the history of spacetime -- absolutely timeless. I personally know of 'gangstas' who would generally be thought of as cynics, but who happen to love this story and have always supported its underlying message. This movie is in no way shape or form, corny. I mean -- think about it: LBG was a major prelude to the whole era of ""F the Police"" and one of a few movies that reminds some of us (OGs) that words like 'rad' still have application and how much power there is in numbers. LBJ isn't your average teen angst flick by any measure -- oh no! LBJ truly is legendary and a cautionary tale following along the dark lines of George Orwell's famous 1984. In this sense, Big Brother and the local government gone bad are not only watching, but they ARE out to get you -- interstate chase -- hunt-you-down-for-real style. And once again, no real world get-away sequence is complete and absolutely effective unless a subject can visualize at least one frame of the underground blueprint imbedded within LBJ while in the midst of evasive action. LBJ is so epic in scope that this ought to be the rule of thumb for anyone attempting to beat an evil system on any level. LBJ is the quintessential frame of reference. Always remember that...Just thinking about the movie invokes images of the ultimate Bonnie and Clyde scenario turned geopolitical saga. And I play the Pat Benatar ""Love is a Battlefield"" tape (yes, old school cassette tape) religiously -- at least twice a month. Moreover, the only other rebel story that comes to mind as being comparable to the Legend of Billie Jean would have to be Styxx ""Kilroy Was Here,"" but that's another story...Finally, no one in the world can say that he/ she is part of the true legacy of the true Resistance without having first seen the Legend of Billie Jean.

A lot of people were drunk and they bum rushed the extras (police officers) and one guy got a separated shoulder. The third was it was my 26th birthday (Nov. 10th)and we are on the beach, a lot of people were in swim trunks and bikinis there was goose dumps everywhere. Anyway, I was going to be one of the sheriffs officers that drove to the top of the sand dunes in a jeep to shoot Christian Slater (Binx)  But they could not find a uniform that would fit me.

But I did get a pay check for eighty something dollars.  And at that point and time I put my film career behind me.",The Legend of Billie Jean
47,hewitt_films23,Film Review,10,5 July 2014,"This film was fantastic! I was only 6 years old when it came out, but the film still to this day has had a huge impression on me, the music was great, the acting and cast were great. I love the story line; it was different from the 80's films, it gave a little darkness to it if you look between the lines, I am sure they could have made it a darker film but I don't think they wanted to appeal to that audience. Growing up in the 1980's I feel was a very fantastic time for film, it was almost like the boundaries that were put up against film ideas were torn down and some of the greatest films were made then. The legend of Billie Jean was really a great film and I have to say that the lead role of a female actress at that time as the hero was refreshing. ~Brian Hewitt~ HEWITT FILMS",The Legend of Billie Jean
48,Jax696,Never Sell Out or Give Up -Reliving my twenties with a smile and a nod to Pat Bentar,10,26 August 2005,"Some days I just want to take it easy and remember the good old days when I was a teenager and had no real problems. This film takes me back 20 years, when in the heat of the summer night we used to sneak out the 2nd story window to adventure and excitement.The acting is believable, characters well cast and film nicely shot. Its a getaway for forty something women, with an awesome but not egotistical heroine, a solid loyal sibling and a sweet sincere romantic guy that we all dream of meeting someday.The song ""Invincible"" from the soundtrack by Pat Bentar stirs up even more memories of a time when MTV was young and the short hair cut was a sign of rebellion and the contrary move for strong young women. Thank god I grew up in a time when I didn't have to tattoo my body or pierce my face to show I was tough or different or independent.",The Legend of Billie Jean
49,chattykitty,Also a guilty pleasure for me!,10,15 March 2001,"I never miss this movie when it's on tv!Ever since I first saw the movie, (I was 8) I was so completely drawn into the story. I am now 24 and I am afraid to admit that I still love the concept of the young heroine seeking justice against the grown-up ""system"".I can remember shouting ""Fair is fair"" back at the television, and I occasionally still do! I think that if you have the time for an ""old school"", Pat Benitar, ""Girl Power"" movie, this is the one to see!!Don't forget to wear the 30 gummy bracelets and and appetite for tons of 80's chick band music!",The Legend of Billie Jean

51,RikkileeBeau,"Great movie, it's fun to watch.",10,21 August 2001,"Man, this movie is just the greatest. Every time it comes on TV I have to watch it. It's so much fun to watch. Christian Slater as Binx is great, he's so cute. Billie Jean is one cool cat and one tough cookie. :) One of my favorite parts is when they go to Lloyd's house, it's hilarious. This movie is just so awesome, it's a must-see. I love it, I give it as many stars as it possibly can get!",The Legend of Billie Jean
52,george78412,'Legend' captures the mid-eighties in South Texas perfectly!,10,28 October 2006,"This movie is one of my favorites from the mid-eighties. I was in ninth grade when filming began in my hometown of Corpus Christi. Some of my friends were even extras in the movie. It amazes me how many of the landmarks that are used in the movie are still the same. At the same time it's pretty cool to point out to Billie Jean 'newbies' what has changed in Corpus Christi and what hasn't. I remember how excited we were when we were watching it in the theater. The acting is very good, especially from a young Christian Slater. Like other comments posted, I was surprised that it wasn't a bigger movie than it was. I'll keep hoping for a DVD release just like everyone else who loves this movie. We were surprised that a soundtrack was never released.",The Legend of Billie Jean
53,fiery_charging_pegasus,ditto ditto ditto to Barry Iverson,10,23 January 2007,"Barry, my man, I could have wrote your review. I also saw ""Billie Jean"" as a kid, and it blew me away. I loved her toughness, resolve, her cynical edge, the way she didn't take crap, and the way she had no fear.Everything that I felt I DIDN'T have at the time that I first saw it. I was living in a dysfunctional home, and those were qualities I was definitely NOT allowed to have. I suppose I idolized Billie Jean for those traits.She also had friends who stood behind her and had her back. I felt I didn't have that, either. Funny how movies move you, and how they keep you going through life.Oh, funny story. The only movie channel my family ever had was HBO. ""Billie Jean"" was NeVeR on HBO!!! Or, if it was, I never had the chance to record it. So, it was finally on Cinemax. I asked a friend's mom if she would tape it for me. ROFL They soooooooo thought I was weird!!! Years of wanting to get in on tape, and now ten years later I still have it. :)Ciao",The Legend of Billie Jean
54,NathanLaneLover,This movie is one of the best movies i've ever seen,10,12 February 2002,I saw this movie on t.v. I was watching it with my sister and we loved it it came on like three time so we watched it again. I can't see how anyone couldn't like it. I've read alot of bad comments about it but it was soooo good. Keith Gordon is hot!,The Legend of Billie Jean
55,vangoghsear-2,1980s Dross!,1,15 December 2007,"This movie has to be among the absolute worst from 1980s Hollywood that was responsible for producing some of the least watchable movies ever. With the exception of the soundtrack, there is absolutely nothing redeeming here. I watched it simply because it was on TCM's ""Underground"", and had heard it referenced on VH1's ""I Love the Eighties"" as the butt of quite a few jokes. After viewing it, I can see why it was ripped so mercilessly. There is less acting in this movie than in an Ed Wood feature, and without the originality, or camp, that his films were full of. Time spent watching this flick would be better spent reading warning labels on household cleaning fluids.",The Legend of Billie Jean
56,thefreck2,lesbian subtext at its purest!,10,8 January 2004,"Brilliant.  Absolutely brilliant.  Not only has this movie revamped my faith in Helen Slater movies (come on - Supergirl 'aint that bad!), but it has added ""fair is fair"" into my daily (yes, daily) vernacular.  Pure fun. Pure angst.  And so making a huge deal about 300 dollars and change.  Christian Slater has never been as cool.  And really, any movie that starts a trend with chicks cutting their hair short is a movie for all.  Brilliant!  A+ (although I hate the pants Lloyd wears...forgiven) - and where did she get the Alphaville space-suit she wears after she shaves her head?  Oh who cares.  Fair is fair!",The Legend of Billie Jean
57,billiejean1985,MY absolute favorite movie of all time!!!,10,15 June 2003,"L.B.J.  by now is obviously dated, but I like to think of it as having captured a moment of our teenage culture during the 80's.  It certainly brings back some fashion horrors I remember experiencing.  Maybe I just put a lot of sentimental value into this movie, but I definately think it's worth a watch.  While the underground cult following is slowly coming up for air and demanding a dvd release, I would personally like to suggest an edition featuring the deleted scenes that can be found in the script (if you are so lucky as to have found one, you would know of the motel scene that never made it into the final release of the film.) Some cheesy one-liners and inappropriate dialogue (bleeding where?WHY??  I understand a need to transition, but that was a little cheap) Over-all, however, Billie Jean will have you on her side, your fists pounding the air, shouting  ""Fair is fair!""",The Legend of Billie Jean
58,mybrutuspup,DVD recommendations,10,29 June 2006,"I really love this movie, I wish they would come out with this movie in DVD format. It is really a great movie, this young teenage girl was found guilty, by a very bad man. He tried to ruin her but she fought back in the long run she won. This movie is an inspiration for people who are accused of crimes before they are truly found guilty. She finally gets with a young guy who is willing to help her get out of this mess, that she got into. This is a wonderful show for all who like this kind of movie. I really hope that this show will be added to DVD. VHS tapes go bad so easy, after they go bad we can't watch these great shows.",The Legend of Billie Jean

60,deadi007,2 Thumbs up!,9,21 November 2003,Caught this movie on TV at like 6am and watched it on a whim.. mainly because i was too lazy to change the channel.. but I was glad I didn't change it. This movie is very influential! Being an employee at a movie theater I basically know movies and seem to be very critical at times. This movie definately gets a 2 thumbs up which is rare from me-Chris,The Legend of Billie Jean
61,hiltsgirldeb,hiltsgirldeb,10,5 February 2005,"This movie was awesome,Billy jean didn't start out asking for trouble but it happened and she didn't stand back and do nothing even though she may have been wrong in what she did, I see her point of doing it. The movie also shows that some adults do lie like the store owner Mr Pyatt. To top it all off when Mr Pyatt started to make a lot of money selling her picture shirts hats posters and other stuff. I think that that really was a bad example of a adult. But it shows that not all people in this world are honest and that some people would make cash over a horrible situation and thats sad to think they would do that. But its part of real life and I don't know why I am surprised at it. Binx really loved his scooter and when Hubie and his gang destroyed it Binx was hurt bad and I can see why his sister billy jean did what she did. She loved her brother and all she wanted was Hubie's dad to paid it to get another because Fair is fair. Any normal person would of paid it and punished the kid but in this case Mr Pyatt was worse than the kid. Then it was bad when the police wouldn't and couldn't do anything about it. Billyjean felt the need to make things right and took things in her own hands but she never meant for all the trouble but I saw her point of wanting the store owner to pay for his sons actions of wrong doings to her brother Binx by ruining his red scooter bike that he treasured. I thought the kidnapping thing was a bit much but it kept the movie interesting. I never loss any interest in the movie. I kept my eyes on the movie it was so good I didn't leave the room for anything for fear of missing something. The hair cutting was kinda different I didn't expect her to do that but she was making the statement of fair is fair i guess. The coolest part was when Billyjean left putter and Ophelia in the station wagon and called the police to say where they were. She showed great concern and love for her friends. I thought putters mom was rude and way outta line the way she treated that girl. I don't think I would of been that nice to my mom if she treated me like that. I laughed when putter cut her hair in front of her mom, i wasn't sure what she was doing when she reached for the scissors it kept me in suspense a little there for a short second. I would tell everyone to buy this movie because it is worth watching, there are parts that are funny and parts that are sad. When binx got shot that was sadI would recommend this movie to everyone. I loved the part toward the end when all the items that Mr pyatt had made up hats shirts posters etc the kids started throwing all the stuff in the fire so he couldn't make a profit anymore. The other part I liked is when the cop said to Mr pyatt that he would make a profit off of the items and but wouldn't pay for the scooter so none of this would of happened. It might of been in beginning but I liked that part. I though Mr pyatt would have a guilty feeling but yet he didn't he showed his greed. The movie made me laugh made me cry it was good..",The Legend of Billie Jean
62,rothenberger,The Legend of Billie Jean should definitely be on DVD!,10,27 February 2005,"It just doesn't make much sense to stop printing a cult classic from the 80s when they're are plenty of trashy films out their making it onto DVD, and sometimes re-released into the theaters. I mean, if I can find a movie like Ice Pirates on DVD, shouldn't ""Billie Jean"" on the list also? I mean what are we paying these guys for anyway? This has been an all time favorite of mine ever since it came out in 85. I wish there was some way to convince the movie industry to start making some effort on restoring these nostalgic cult classics the same way they do with all the other classics. Maybe these movie critics are just getting paid too much to write reviews on these cut-rate films and really aren't paying attention to the quality of cinema. Well, I suppose we'll just have to rely on VHS to relive our memories.",The Legend of Billie Jean
63,Cuellar_6,"Corpus Christi, TX was sure different in 1985 than in 2005",7,3 March 2005,"I still remember back in 1985 when they filmed ""The Legend of Billie Jean"". There was Magic Isles a fun little amusement park that shut down and after a couple years is now a go-cart and mini golf place. The other mini golf place is not around anymore. Then there is Sunrise Mall (in the movie was called Ocean Park Mall). Back in the 80's that mall was cool and was the mall everyone went to hang out. And now it's a real dump now. The Dockside is still around but now there is a freeway in front of it. The other scenes the filming at the beach. The Corpus Christi Country Club, the Port, and downtown. It shows how Corpus Christi was in the 1980's. It was a good movie but they should have beat up Mr. Pyatt at the end.",The Legend of Billie Jean

65,liberal_rep,Truth is Truth,9,21 January 2015,"While this is truly an '80s movie and the acting is a little blah, the plot is actually an everyday event. There is such bullying and even though there are state and federal laws against it, it still happens. These teens tried to tell the truth and because of their age, were discriminated against, simply because of their ages. While I don't agree with vigilante justice, the end justifies the need to take people, no matter the age, serious. The ""dad"" in the movie, sad yet it happens on a daily basis. I watched this movie when it came out and I felt such a connection to Billy Jean. I know the injustice that children/young adults face. I hope you watch the movie and even though it is an ""'80s"" movie, the plot/story behind the movie, is a timeless truth... Enjoy!",The Legend of Billie Jean

Helen slater was born to do this movie and Christian slater was excellent, and Yardley smith was SO cute, especially with that long hair, if you have not rented this movie then you need to. a true classic 80's film. The Music was great especially Pat banter song for the movie, and the fashion was so 80's I love the way they had all the girls in the movie following Billie Jean's style.

I realize I was born the year this movie came out but I love it regardless.I watch it every chance I get.Besides I'm stuck in the 80's anyway.I envy Billie Jean.She's so cool!

Something serious happens in the movie and instead of trying hide behind social media or some liberal lawyer this chick does it on her own. He finds her true identity and stands up for herself.

Brilliantly acted by Helen Slater and the rest of the cast should have at least been nominated for supporting Oscars. Do not miss this one! Netflix it now! The fact this movie was overlooked by the critics and the Oscars is beyond me. The movie perfectly encapsulates the 80's. Slater, of the Supergirl fame, plays a bit of a punk rebel with good intentions. Early in the film, she let's it remain known that she will not be pushed around. She is not pushed around in the gas station, she held her ground in Mr. Pyatt's office, and she refused to let the media get the best of her or her friends. In this sense Billie Jean is a powerful woman and role model for blossoming feminists.",The Legend of Billie Jean
