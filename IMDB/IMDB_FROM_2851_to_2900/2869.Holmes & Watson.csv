0,MartinHafer,It's hard to imagine Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly not being funny....but here it is.,1,13 August 2019,"Sherlock Holmes is determined to capture Professor Moriarty. However, Holmes (Will Ferrell) is an idiot and seems to do his best to help Moriarty escape....and having his devoted partner hung instead! And, in doing so, he's allowing Moriarty's plot to kill the Queen to move forward.One of my favorite comedies is ""Talladega Nights"" starring Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly. And, while not as funny, their film ""Step Brothers"" also makes me smile. So, you'd think that the pair would pretty much a guarantee of a good laugh....though ""Holmes & Watson"" is ample proof that even this duo can make a dud. And, it all boils down to the script, as ""Holmes & Watson"" hasn't a single laugh in the film. Instead, it resorts to the cheap and disgusting...such as vomiting, an autopsy, male lactation, horse excrement, and urination. Most children could write a script funnier than this bilge.The bottom line is that even funny folks need a competent script....and this script is pure crap through and through. Unfunny, mean-spirited and stupid....that's ""Holmes & Watson"". Rarely has a film cost this much and delivered so little.
By the way, if you watch this film (DON'T), it's obvious they set it up for a sequel. Considering nearly everyone hated ""Holmes & Watson"" the chances of this sequel are pretty much one in a billion (give or take 10).",Holmes & Watson
1,SnoopyStyle,Dumb and Dumber,4,3 September 2019,"Sherlock Holmes (Will Ferrell) and Dr. Watson (John C. Reilly) are best friends since childhood. Holmes was bullied by all the rich kids and Watson was the janitor's son. Professor James Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes) is on trial but Holmes has a revelation. Queen Victoria is under threat. The boys meet American doctor Grace Hart (Rebecca Hall) and her simpleton travel companion Millicent (Lauren Lapkus). Mrs. Martha Hudson (Kelly Macdonald) is the boys' very inappropriate housekeeper.This is aggressively unfunny. There is a central problem. Holmes is both super smart and super moronic. In Pink Panther, Clouseau stumbles his way into solving his cases. That's not the case here. Holmes is actually smart and solves his cases deductively. He's also a complete idiot and those two clash at the same time in the same scenes. It's hella confusing. It never comes to solving that central problem. As for the comedy, there is only one funny line in the whole movie. "" I'm actually more taken with the mystery. It's a whodunnit and not necessarily a solvable one. It is however a definable one with specific suspects. So the mystery is better than the comedy and that's not a good thing for this movie. These two are really struggling in this one.",Holmes & Watson
2,boblipton,Don't Bother,1,4 March 2021,"This movie is as bad as its awful reputation. You may cease reading now, since I have imparted everything you need to know about it. I will now blather on for a few lines.It is poorly written. When I heard the word ""kids"" in the frst two minutes to mean small children, and saw girls in a British public school in the 19th century, I thought I was in for a YOUNG EINSTEIN sort of movie. No, it is sloppily, uncaringly written, and nothing about it gives any impression that anyone behind the camera put more than minimal thought into the movie. There are shots that are out of focus.Ah, you say, but how about the jokes. There is one good gag, in which the Robert Downey movies are mocked: overcranked sequences in which Holmes analyses what a course of action will yield..... only to have his analysis turn out long. This gag is done three times. There are also urine jokes, sexual assault jokes, and other examples of juvenile humor whch are not elaborated, only repeated.I've wasted an hour and a half watching this piece of garbage and another ten writing this. That's more than enough.",Holmes & Watson
3,Prismark10,Not got a clue to make you laugh,1,12 March 2019,"Holmes & Watson is a silly, outlandish slapstick comedy that also goofs the Robert Downey Holmes movies. It even pokes fun at Trump. Make England Great Again!The problem is there have been better comedic takes on the Sherlock Holmes stories such as Without a Clue.Holmes & Watson is just a race to the bottom of the barrel. It is an ill conceived and unfunny movie.The film begins at the trial of Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes) where all the witnesses have mysteriously failed to turn up. Holmes turns up at the last minute and gets Moriarty released.Officials from Buckingham Palace hires Holmes as there is a plot to kill Queen Victoria (Pam Ferris) in four days time. The possible suspect is Moriarty. The final action scenes take place during the launch of the Titanic.Ferrell and Reilly are saddled with an idiotic script and terrible direction from Etan Cohen. Ferrell mugs relentlessly to the camera and the film has no clear focus as to what kind of comedy it wants to be.",Holmes & Watson
4,nogodnomasters,Club him like a baby seal,3,7 February 2019,"Will Farrell plays Holmes like a bumbling fool with moments of genius that never works. He has rock star status. Much of the film is predictable slapstick. It spoofs the Robert Downey Jr. version, but not too well. The plot was immaterial and the film was made to create one-liners and anachronisms critical of the Trump Administration.I consider Will Ferrell to be rather talentless and he demonstrated that here as he did when he ruined ""Bewitched."" Rebecca Hall as Dr. Grace Hart was the bright spot of the film. The production also had some sophomoric sexual humor.The film takes place in 1881Houdini was born in 1874.
Einstein 1879.
Titanic 1912.",Holmes & Watson
5,kosmasp,Silly,6,25 September 2019,"I'm guessing some won't even read this, but for those who do, even though they feel offended by the movie and my rating: I get it. I felt similar when I saw the depiction of Bruce Lee in Once upon a time in America. And I'm not talking about how he fought or how he looked, but the way he was depicted. Arrogant is one thing (he may or may not have been like this or close to that), but the fact he was made to look as though he wasn't smart (to put it mildly).Having said all that, there is more to OuaTiH, something that can hardly be applied here. Because you have quite the silly and really quite questionable depiction of two beloved figures. Not because the filmmakers don't like them, but because they wanted to do something different.And boy is this different. Predictable still and quite the rude humor and a bit dull for some for sure. It's tough to see merits, like the amount of good actors involved in this in smaller roles. You may or may not care, but if you don't adjust yourself into what is going down with this movie, you will have the worst time ....",Holmes & Watson
6,classicsoncall,"""May I present to you, the greatest detective of all time...""",4,14 July 2019,"The few professional reviews I read of this movie basically said it was terrible. They were wrong. It's worse than that. What could have been a well conceived parody of the Sherlock Holmes franchise actually resulted in a sophomoric treatment that aimed for the lowest common denominator. Quite honestly, the film could have been titled ""Dumb and Dumber"" and no one would have known the difference. The only bright spot I could pick out was the cleverly written musical rendition of Holmes (Will Ferrell) bemoaning his ill treatment of Watson (John C. Reilly) by sending him to the gallows. I'm in full agreement with IMDb voters on this one, a 3.8 rating as I write this is about what the movie deserves. At least John C. Reilly had the good fortune to redeem his good name by portraying Oliver Hardy in ""Stan and Ollie"" around the same time this aberration came out. Small comfort though, in the grand scheme of things.",Holmes & Watson
7,jboothmillard,Holmes & Watson,1,14 July 2019,"I was tempted to see this film, a comedic take on the legendary Arthur Conan Doyle creation, at the cinema at the time, because I like the two lead actors, they were famously together in Step Brothers, but I changed my mind when I heard all the negativity surrounding it, it bombed at the box office, and was panned by critics, I had to see why. Basically, in 1867 England, Sherlock Holmes (Razzie nominated Will Ferrell), who was constantly bullied as a child, has concealed his emotions and dedicated his efforts strictly to knowledge. One day, he befriends Dr. John Watson (Razzie winning John C. Reilly), after he survived falling from the roof after an attempted suicide, Watson is impressed with his brilliance. Years later, Holmes is viewed as a legendary detective, while Watson does not get much credit at all. Holmes and Watson are to view the trial of Professor James Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes), but they are temporarily delayed by a package, sent by Moriarty, brought in by their housekeeper Mrs. Martha Hudson (Kelly Macdonald). At the trial, Holmes reveals the man at the stand is an imposter named Jacob Musgrave, who is incapable of committing the murders due to tremors in his hand caused by excessive masturbation. Despite attempts by Inspector Lestrade (Rob Brydon) to convince everyone that Holmes is wrong, Holmes is convinced that Moriarty is currently travelling to the United States. After the trial, the duo attends a surprise birthday party for Holmes at Buckingham Palace, where a corpse is discovered inside of a birthday cake along with a message from Moriarty, stating that Victoria (Pam Ferris) will die in 4 days' time. During the autopsy, Holmes and Watson meet Dr. Grace Hart (Rebecca Hall) and the feral Millicent (Lauren Lapkus). Watson and Holmes become enamored with Grace and Millie, respectively. Following the autopsy, Watson declares that the death is indeterminable, while Holmes believes the cause of death was poisoning. Furthermore, he believes that the poison came from Gustav Klinger (Steve Coogan). Holmes and Watson locate Klinger, who is indeed in cahoots with Moriarty, but he is murdered before he can reveal anything else. Holmes decides to seek help from his brother Mycroft (Hugh Laurie), who tells him that the murderer is someone close to him. Holmes mistakenly believes Watson to be the murderer and has him arrested. He comes to regret this decision, causing his concealed emotions to break out. Holmes goes to Watson's cell, but he has already broken out, with assistance from the housekeeper. He tracks down Watson and Mrs. Hudson, revealed to be the daughter of Moriarty, to the launching of the Titanic, where the murder of Queen Victoria is to take place. After apologising and helping Watson, they rush to the main room and discover a bomb, which Watson throws out of the window. The bomb lands in Mrs. Hudson's boat, killing her and her accomplices. The pair are congratulated by the Queen, only for Holmes to defer the credit to Watson. The pair reconnect with Grace and Millie, the latter reveals that her feral personality was an act of manipulation, each pair share a kiss before Grace and Millie board the Titanic. After returning home, Holmes proudly displays a plaque on their building showing that Watson is a co-detective, finally giving him recognition. Later, Holmes and Watson confront Moriarty in a bar in the United States. Also starring Hector Bateman-Harden as Young Holmes, Codie-Lei Eastick as Young Watson, Laura Stevely as Sherlock's Mom, Michael Culkin as The Judge, Wolf Roth as Sigmund Freud, Nathan Osgood as Mark Twain, David Shackleton as Albert Einstein, Paul Cassidy as Charlie Chaplin, Michael Buffer (""Let's get ready to do scuffle""), and Billy Zane as himself (a homage to his role in Titanic). It was thought that Ferrell and Reilly back together spelt a sure-fire hit, unfortunately Ferrell turns clever Sherlock into an egotistical, narrow-minded idiot, while Reilly is an equally moronic, very simple-minded inquisitor, and performances from established greats like Fiennes, Ferris, and Macdonald don't improve things. The critics complained that it is badly scripted, the performances are terrible, and it is full of puerile, dated and unfunny jokes, they are completely right, it is cringing, insults the audience's intelligence, and makes a complete mockery of the famous fictional detectives (not in a good way), a rubbish mystery buddy comedy. It won the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Director for Etan Cohen (not to be confused with Ethan Coen, of the Coen Brothers), and Worst Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel, and it was nominated Worst Screen Combo for Ferrell and Reilly ""trashing two of literature's most beloved characters"". Poor!",Holmes & Watson
8,sunwarrior13,Skip At All Costs,1,27 June 2019,"Will Ferrell and John C.Reilly together with Rebecca Hall stars in this film directed by Etan Cohen entitled,""Holmes & Watson"". The movie is a comedic take at Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's short stories of Sherlock Holmes.Well-known literary detective Sherlock Holmes,portrayed by Will Ferrell, and his partner Dr. John Watson,use their incredible mystery solving skills in solving a murder mystery.Through their excellent deductive skills,they were able to figure out the mystery as the guilty one got punished while the one wrongly accused got freed.This was totally a disaster. The jokes were extremely unfunny.The story was extremely stupid and totally incomprehensible as the jokes are no longer recognizable. Added to that,we also see the movie as a total insult to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's great literary work as well as the legendary characters of Holmes and Dr.Watson as it was extremely idiotic.No wonder it won the 2018 Razzie's Worst Picture together with Reilly as the Worst Supporting Actor and Cohen as the Worst Director.",Holmes & Watson
9,zardoz-13,Elementary Nonsense in Varying Degrees of Lunacy,7,8 January 2019,"Since Sir Arthur Conan Doyle created him, the popularity of Sherlock Holmes as a literary character has never diminished. In his scholarly study, ""The Sherlock Holmes Handbook: The Methods and Mysteries of the World's Greatest Detective,"" Sherlockian connoisseur Christopher Redmond champions Holmes as ""the world's favourite character for English-language films."" Puffing on his habitual meerschaum pipe and jaunty in his customary deerstalker cap, the renowned detective made his debut in ""A Study in Scarlet"" in 1887. Later, Doyle wrote three more novels, along with 56 short stories. Victorian Era readers discovered Holmes largely in ""The Strand"" magazine. Craving his adventures with conspicuous relish, they clamored for his return after Doyle killed him off Sherlock at Reichenbach Falls amid the Swiss Alps in ""The Final Problem"" in 1893. Many refused to renew subscriptions, and circulation plummeted. Doyle held out for a decade before granting the character a new lease on life. He penned his final Holmes story ""The Adventure of the Retired Colourman"" in 1927. Since Doyle's passage in 1930, dozens of Sherlock Holmes tribute novels have been published. Long after his creator's death, Holmes has not merely survived, but also flourished, considerably in film and television. Inevitably, after more than fifty films, Sherlock's popularity made him a candidate for parody. Traditionally, as the second banana, Doctor Watson has been portrayed either as a non-entity or a nincompoop, while the eccentric Holmes remains aloof, shrewd, and often pedantic. Although film and television treat Holmes with dignity, as a role model, often hushing up his narcotic dependence, some filmmakers have spoofed the sagacious sleuth with a wink and a smile. For example, did anybody watch the ""Gnomeo and Juliet"" sequel ""Sherlock Gnomes"" released in the spring of 2018?The latest send-up of Sherlock Holmes casts former ""Saturday Night Live"" funnyman Will Ferrell as the gimlet-eyed, amateur detective and John C. Reilly as his inseparable sidekick Dr. John Watson. Mind you, ""Holmes & Watson"" doesn't qualify as a comic masterpiece. Unfortunately, the structured material doesn't allow ""Get Hard"" writer & director Etan Cohan much room to improvise. Nevertheless, the farcical humor is often amusing in ways which only faithful Ferrell fans may appreciate. ""Holmes & Watson"" opens with a memorable scene about the youthful detective's first day at school. His classmates bully him without mercy. Eventually, they fool him into kissing a donkey. Ultimately, he gains the upper hand, primarily because he can control his emotions. Afterward, he exposes scandalous things about them which prompt school officials to expel them. Cohan returns to this theme frequently as Holmes advocates brain over brawn. Meantime, Watson's fond desire to attain equality with Holmes as a co-detective. Sherlock dismisses this fantasy out of hand until events compel him to realize how integral Watson is to his investigations. They team up to thwart a copycat of their arch-nemesis, the wicked Dr. Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes of ""Skyfall""), who threatens to kill Queen Victoria. All along, Scotland Yard Inspector Lestrade (Rob Brydon of ""The Huntsman: Winter's War"") has argued that no copycat exists. Nevertheless, Holmes remains adamant that a copycat has been imitating Moriarty. Indeed, Holmes points out that Moriarty has fled to America and take refuge in the Wild West! Ferreting out this copycat killer turns out to be a challenge.Cohan's irreverent screenplay may alienate purists for the liberties that he has taken with hallowed material. Several scenes in ""Holmes & Watson"" stand out for their sheer hilarity. The ""Weekend at Bernie's"" ordeal when our desperate duo struggle frantically to cram Victoria's unconscious body into a trunk far smaller than her voluminous bulk is hysterical. The ludicrous scene where Holmes and Watson swat each other as a poisonous mosquito flits back and forth between them exemplifies textbook slapstick. When Cohan isn't poking fun at his protagonists, he levels some criticisms about sexual inequality in Victorian England and adds some veiled but sarcastic commentary about the Electoral College and Donald Trump's presidential shenanigans. At one point, Ferrell's Sherlock dons a fez with the slogan ""Make England Great Again."" Meantime, Cohan has apparently perused ""The Sign of Four"" because he incorporates one of Holmes' signature lines: ""How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?"" Cohan cannot resist the impulse to lampoon the two Robert Downey, Jr. ""Sherlock Holmes"" epics. Ferrell's Holmes imagines chalk drawings and elaborate calculations in anticipation of a dire predicament, too. Unlike Downey's Holmes, Ferrell miscalculates wildly, particularly when he fails to topple an ogre-like boxing adversary.Comparatively, ""Holmes & Watson"" is neither as hilarious nor as ingenious as ""Without A Clue"" (1985). In that parody, Watson originated Holmes as a recurring magazine hero and hired a drunken stage actor to portray him in public. A lowest-common-denominator farce, with elements of slapstick, ""Holmes & Watson"" surpasses Gene Wilder's lukewarm parody ""The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother"" (1975). Cohen sticks to the traditional mystery formula in ""Holmes & Watson,"" except Holmes acts like a witless imbecile. Blundering about with a falsetto English accent, Ferrell plays his typical clueless character. John C. Reilly is just as sidesplitting, but he maintains an imperturbable straight-face. Observe how he holds Victoria's hand discreetly in their scenes together. Ferrell and Reilly were riotous in both ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006) as well as ""Step Brothers"" (2008). Cohan stages all their scenes with an equality rarely seen even serious Holmes mysteries. Surprisingly, Watson is a crack shot with his revolver, and he can pound a giant into submission with a folding chair. Furthermore, he cavorts with their leading lady, Dr. Grace Hart (Rebecca Hall of ""The Town""), as they perform an autopsy on a murdered corpse that fell out of a huge cake during Holmes' surprise birthday party at Queen Victoria's Palace. Clocking in at 91 nimble minutes, the above-average, PG-13 rated ""Holmes & Watson"" delivers elementary nonsense in varying degrees of lunacy from fade-in to fade out.",Holmes & Watson
10,view_and_review,Ricky Bobby Holmes and Cal Naughton Watson,6,30 December 2018,"So, if you've seen Talladega Nights then you've seen Holmes and Watson. Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly fall into familiar roles as superior and subordinate but instead of Ricky Bobby and Cal Naughton Jr. they were Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. That's not to say there were no laughs, in fact I laughed plenty, it's just very unoriginal. Now, you may say, ""Of course it's unoriginal. It's Sherlock Holmes."" That's not what I meant. I mean the fact that they fell into the same type of roles and antics as Talladega Nights made it unoriginal. Add to that an odd musical number out of nowhere and it kind of leaned toward flop status.I'd say that what saved it were the frequent references to current popular issues such as selfies, women's equality, and our current president. They worked those jokes in there in an overt yet clever way such that you couldn't help but laugh. The overall product lacked distinguishability but Ferrell and Reilly were silly enough to bring about just enough laughs to prevent a fail.",Holmes & Watson
11,Wizard-8,"It could have been worse... but yeah, it's pretty terrible",2,26 June 2019,"Normally, I avoid the movies of Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, because their typical brand of comedy is a kind I simply don't find all that amusing. But I sought out this particular movie of theirs, because I had heard so many ghastly reviews about it labelling it as one of the worst comedies of all time, and I have a penchant for extreme cinematic disasters. So is the movie really all that bad? Well, there were a small handful of gags that did provoke some (very) mild titters from me, but apart from those moments, I did find the movie to be as bad as other have made it out to be. There are some additional attempts at humor in the movie that COULD have worked with better staging and execution, but they are badly botched by writer/director Etan Cohen and the cast. But most of the humor is so lazy, so familiar, and so predictable, that even the best direction and performances could not milk any positive reactions from an audience. I think an additional problem is that Sherlock Holmes has previously been done to death both seriously and comically that it would require a herculean effort to add new life to the character. All that Cohen can seem to do is stuff like make many modern-day references, showing a real desperateness that will be painfully evident to any viewers. Not the worst comedy I have seen, but it all the same sinks to a real low point in the history of Hollywood movie comedies.",Holmes & Watson
12,FlashCallahan,Where's the bar on this canoe?.......,5,31 January 2019,"Detective Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson join forces to investigate a mysterious murder at Buckingham Palace.It seems like an open-and-shut case as all signs point to Professor James Moriarty, the criminal mastermind and longtime nemesis of the crime-solving duo.When new twists and clues begin to emerge, the world's greatest sleuth and his trusted assistant must now use their legendary wits and ingenious methods to catch the killer before the queen becomes the next victim.......Released when no one really bothers to go to the cinema, H&W came out of nowhere and had flip written all over it.And while in some senses it is an unmitigated disaster, when you compare it to the casts other bodies of work, it's still a curiosity piece that needs to be seen, just so you know how ludicrous the whole film is.But, and this is a very loose but, see the film with the lowest common denominator of expectations, and you can revel in the fact that the film has so much potential, and throws every aspect of it out of the window.It's always good to see Ferrell and Reilly together in a film, and here they do have the chemistry that they always have, but as the old adage goes, they are clearly having so much more fun making the film.Add a wonderful British cast, and a very bizarre cameo from Billy Zane, and you truly have one of the most mind blowing films released in 2018.There are a couple of laughs to be had, but they are so childish, you can see the punchline coming before the chicken crosses the road.It's not going to tarnish anybody's career, because it's never going to be remembered, but I feel it will become something of a cult classic in years to come, due to the awful PPV jokes, Trumpisms, and an amazing cast really trying hard to accomplish something",Holmes & Watson
13,deloudelouvain,"I had fun, like always have with Will Ferrell.",7,19 March 2019,"I'm glad I didn't pay too much attention at the extremely bad reviews and the incredible low score Holmes & Watson got here on IMDb. And I'm also glad I'm not the only one that had a good time watching this movie. I just can't help it but when I see Will Ferrell's face I already have to laugh. I laugh with all his movies so I wasn't surprised I did like this movie much more than I'm supposed to when you concider the low ratings. Will Ferrell played Holmes in his typical way, a bit clumsy and dumb but always funny to watch. John C. Reilly was just perfect as Watson, even better than Will Ferrell in my opinion. Holmes & Watson is just another good comedy if you like Will Ferrell's style of humor. If not, too bad...",Holmes & Watson

Good Lord do I regret that move.This is ninety minutes of ill-advised and half-assed jokes, delivered in terrible English accents and seemingly with malicious intent. Any goodwill Reilly and Ferrell have earned from their previous outings is gravely wounded.Let me put it like this: even my wife - far more forgiving than myself - had to admit this was awful. Tired and mind-numbing, it's the kind of movie that left me wishing I'd just gone to ""Aquaman"" instead. And I'm pretty sure that's a rental.",Holmes & Watson

16,FeastMode,my notes,4,27 July 2019,Made me laugh a few times and was slightly amusing but it's also really bad and had some really horrible jokes (1 viewing),Holmes & Watson
17,Pjtaylor-96-138044,It's intermittently amusing but ultimately average.,5,29 December 2018,"There are some amusing moments but, on the whole, 'Holmes & Watson (2018)' is just totally average. It's not as bad as most reviews purport it to be but it's nowhere near as funny or generally accomplished as you'd expect from a reuniting of Ferrell and Reilly - who are both often hilarious in real life and made the excellent 'Step-brothers (2010)' together. The film is not as much a parody as it is a cash-in on the relatively recently lapsed copyright associated with the Sherlock Holmes character and his earliest of stories, making for a strange missed opportunity when it comes to where the laughs are (supposedly) coming from. The piece also leaves something to be desired in terms of its story - in particular, the central 'mystery' - and its character arcs, the latter of which are mostly rushed through in a bizarre (and lazy) musical moment towards the finale. I didn't necessarily dislike the experience while it was occurring, but it's almost instantly forgettable and the handful of successful jokes don't exactly make you howl, either. 5/10",Holmes & Watson
18,Cineanalyst,The Mystery of the Leaping Fish,2,11 October 2019,"At last, a movie that lives up to the hype. ""Holmes & Watson"" is as awful as audiences and critics forewarned. I'm not a fan of Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly's brand of comedy. Sure, they're fine when they've worked separately on something seriously clever (Ferrell in ""Stranger Than Fiction"" (2006), e.g., or Reilly in ""Stan & Ollie"" (2018)), and even their other picture teamings can produce a few laughs from me, but this one is a complete dud. Perhaps, Adam McKay (who directed the other Ferrell-Reilly movies, but not this one) is just a better director than I suspected. Regardless, together, Ferrell and Reilly are like the Abbott and Costello of today: broad slapstick, juvenile banter, flat jokes, and probably better off on TV. I imagine Abbott and Costello may've done something similar with the material of Arthur Conan Doyle. Strip the source of what made it interesting in the first place, pretend anachronisms are funny on their face, add an unimportant romantic subplot for no good reason, revel in regional differences between people (in this case, Americans and Britons) and, when in doubt, act stupid. Maybe if McKay did this one, the timing would've at least been better, or maybe the digs at the gimmicks of the Robert Downey, Jr. versions of Sherlock Holmes would've been amusing.There's a rich tradition of parodying detective Holmes and his stupid friend, surrogate author Dr. Watson, but you wouldn't know it from viewing ""Holmes & Watson."" And I have no plans to see the also-panned ""Sherlock Gnomes"" (also 2018) anytime soon... or anytime, really. One of the earliest in film history, if not the first, was the 1916 silent short ""The Mystery of the Leaping Fish,"" which stars Douglas Fairbanks. In it, Doug effectively lampoons Sherlock's drug habit (as opposed to here, where the mere mention of ""cocaine"" is supposedly funny) while, ironically, employing his detective skills to thwart drug smugglers. I recommend seeing that over-100-years-old film instead of this soon-to-be-forgotten bore.",Holmes & Watson
19,cricketbat,Bad. But not as bad as a Tyler Perry comedy.,3,4 April 2019,"Holmes & Watson isn't as terrible as I expected it to be, but that doesn't mean it's a good movie. It's not. It's pretty bad. The plot is ridiculous and the jokes are elementary-level humor. This comedy also can't decide how dumb it wants to be. At times, it attempts witty satire, and then it falls over itself while trying to do slapstick. But at least it's better than any Tyler Perry movie I've seen.",Holmes & Watson
20,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews....,4,9 April 2019,"Holmes & WatsonFor criminals, the only benefit to having Sherlock Holmes on the case was that he could be easily bribed with cocaine.However, in this comedy, the great detective is even more formidable when he has snorted nose candy.When Holmes (Will Ferrell) and his partner Watson (John C. Reilly) discover a plot by Holmes' archenemy Professor Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes) to assassinate Queen Victoria, the unorthodox detective only has 4 days to prevent his rival's plan from occurring. But in order to do that, he must seek help from his brother (Hugh Laurie) as well as a female physician (Rebecca Hall).Relying solely on humourless anachronisms to propel its overly simplistic story, this is not the first comedic take on the darling detective, but it is certainly the laziest and most cringe-worthy adaptation.Incidentally, crime scene investigation was so rudimentary in the 1880s that most murders were blamed on solar eclipses. Red Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",Holmes & Watson
21,The-Sarkologist,A Complete Waste,2,28 December 2018,"All I can say about this film is that it was absolutely terrible. Sure, every few years they attempt to redo the Sherlock Holmes story, and some of them are actually pretty good. The problem with this one was that it was trying way, way too hard. In fact it tried so hard that it completely fell flat on its face. Sure, maybe I was attempting to compare it to the Guy Ritchie version that appeared a number of years back, but honestly, even if I put that one out of my mind, this film still would have been incredibly bad.
In a way it is supposed to be a comedy, but as a comedy I found that it was just so not funny. Sure, I may have laughed a couple of times, and there were a few chuckles coming from people in the cinema, but a part of me would shake my hand and wonder what it was that they found to be funny. Okay, they did actually use that famous 'no s*** Sherlock' phrase that has since come into our collective consciousness, but honestly, it would have been so much funnier if it was muttered in Infinity War when Iron Man and Doctor Strange were both on stage at the same time (apparently they were going to do it, but decided against it).
In part, it is supposed to be that Holmes is a bumbling fool, and that Doctor Watson is actually the smart one - except it doesn't work. Well it isn't even like that because Watson comes across as stupid as Holmes was at times, and it didn't even work that way. Oh, and the whole 'Dr Moriarty isn't Dr Moriarty' didn't work as well, and a part of me was surprised that Ralph Fiennes stooped so low as to even appear in this movie despite the fact that he did very, very little - maybe he was just a little too expensive.
Yeah, honestly, this is another one of those films that I would highly recommend that you completely avoid because it is a complete and utter waste of time. Then again, it did mean that I could catch up on a but of sleep, not that I really needed it, but then again it was so bad, and so boring, and so incredibly silly, that I would have had a much more productive day if I had just stayed in bed.",Holmes & Watson

24,cruise01,"Boring, and a waste of time.",1,12 April 2019,"Holmes and Watson (.5 out of 5 stars).Holmes and Watson is by far the worst buddy comedy film about Sherlock Holmes (Will Ferrell) and Watson (John C. Reilly) being the famous detectives trying to solve a mystery crime. The humor takes stupid to a whole new level of boredom. It is unfunny, the humor is annoyingly awkward, and the story and direction is flat and terrible. Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly make a great pair in their previous films. This movie just purely feels outdated with its humor. The story is forgettable and boring. Half way through the film you are left wondering why you are still watching this.Overall, Holmes and Watson is one of the worst films of the year. The cast is dull. The humor and direction is stupid and boring.",Holmes & Watson
25,Floated2,Possible career killer for Will Ferrell?,2,31 July 2019,"This is another movie spoofing the popular Sherlock Holmes character but into a comedy. Initially when this was announced, was looking forward since having enjoyed several of Will Ferrell's work and along him and John C. Reilly which made Stepbrothers a classic. Then once the trailers came out, we could see that the film didn't look too funny but keeping a positive outlook we perhaps thought they were saving the best for the film.As a whole this film isn't funny in the least and is quite forced at times. The slapstick doesn't really work here and the jokes don't hit. For being a supposed mystery film, there weren't clever jokes and the payoff in the end wasn't worth it. At times rather boring.Perhaps not completely bad but this may be a new low and a serious career killer for Will Ferrell. After the House (2017) flopped and was panned, this film was supposed to be the step back in the right direction but as it turned out, Holmes & Watson was an even bigger flop and received worse reviews. We don't know how many more chances Ferrell will get but if he isn't careful, his time may sadly be coming to an end.Fast forward to several years later and we may be looking back and ask ourselves what happened to Will Ferrell's career, and this film may be the answer to that question.",Holmes & Watson
26,eddie_baggins,How could our favourite Step Brothers do this to us :( ?,1,2 May 2019,"I had to do it, I had to see what all the fuss was about, I had to watch Holmes and Watson!How could a film starring two of the best comedic actors of the last decade, the men responsible for genre gems Step Brothers and Talladega Nights, knock out a film that dominated nominations at this year's Razzie Awards, stunk it up at the box office and was derided by critics the world over?It's not that I didn't believe it was possible, you could tell very early on from trailer's and the hush hush approach by its studio Sony that there was very little faith in the end product of Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly's reunion, but surely it couldn't be as bad as everyone was saying, surely these two seasoned pros wouldn't allow themselves to be a part of such a dire and comically bad misfire?Sadly all the bad things said about this genuine dud from director Etan Cohen (who somehow managed to make a film worse than Get Hard) are true, our dreams of Ferrell and Reilly teaming up and mining comedy gold shattered, by a film that fails in all of its intentions to create a crass, innuendo filled Sherlock Holmes adventure that would have audiences chuckling into their popcorn or rolling around the isles in fits of laughter.There could be an in-depth analysis of why Holmes and Watson is such an epic failure, from a lactating Reilly, horrible miss-uses of comedy legends and fine actors such as Steve Coogan, Rebecca Hall, Kelly McDonald, Rob Brydon, Hugh Laurie and Ralph Fiennes and other various cinematic crimes but at the end of the day, you can't help but feel a lot of the films failings fall at the feet of Ferrell and Reilly, who should've known a lot better.No doubt it was great for the two to reunite and spend some quality time together but after creating such a strong repertoire and chemistry together in their hit film's, it's hard to imagine Ferrell or Reilly would've felt good about what they were producing on set each day as their timing is flat, their performances devoid of any creative spark or imagination, instead falling time and time again for an easy gag that may at times raise a slight chuckle or wry smile but mainly just induces cringes and rolled eyes.It's a terribly sad state of affairs witnessing two performers we know can do better flail about in Cohen's lifeless and charmless exercise, making Holmes and Watson not only hard to watch but hard to fathom, questions now must be asked around the fact that is this the last time we see Ferrell and Reilly on screen together? Dashing hopes many had of seeing the long talked about Step Brothers sequel.Final Say -Aside from a few very minor chuckles and tiny moments of potential, Holmes and Watson is a film deserving of its extremely low reputation. Tarnishing the on screen partnership between two of the modern eras most likeable comedians, Holmes and Watson is a crime against cinema, that isn't worth investigating.½ an autopsy out of 5",Holmes & Watson

29,southdavid,The worst film of 2018.,1,7 January 2019,"Man I love reviewing the awful ones. Most of what you see these days is alright, competent, good enough that it's nice sometimes to see something so categorically awful - just to get the juices flowing.Will Ferrell is Sherlock Holmes and John C Reilly is John Watson and they ..... (sigh) .... Actually what are they doing? Moriarty threatens to kill the Queen so they ..... follow up on some leads, I guess. Blunder around in a series of ghastly, tedious, scenes and then mercifully it ends. Then (and I swear this is true) the staff at the cinema congratulate you for making it to the end.So why is it so bad? Partially, it's because it has no idea what its core premise is. I wonder if it suffers from being rewritten multiple times since the initial idea with Sacha Baron Cohen. It's never sure whether its Holmes is a genius, a fraud or an idiot - so across the run time he's all three. It feels like the film should have had Watson as the genuine genius, happy for the credit to go to Holmes - but that went out the window when Reilly was cast and now there's no straight man to the pairing, just two idiots tramping from godawful slapstick scenes to witless parody of modern day via a spoof of the Downey Jnr/Jude Law films. It's chocked full of cameos, Steve Coogan, Hugh Laurie and Rob Brydon all of whom add nothing, no humour, no story... just characters coming and going and adding nothing. They do come of better than Kelly Macdonald though, whose cringeworthy version of Mrs Hudson is a particularly and at the end bafflingly, nadir.At no point last year would I have believed that ""Sherlock Gnomes"" wouldn't be the worst adaptation of the character that I saw last year. ""Holmes and Watson"" not only topped that, it was the definitely the worst film I saw at all last year, certainly one the worst of the decade and, without hyperbole, indubitably of the worst of all time.",Holmes & Watson

And they slaughter it with great wit!,7,2 April 2019,"Incredibly UNDESERVED low Imdb rating. Probably due to the politically INCORRECT jokes about feminism, trump, childviolence etc etc. But all the (possibly) offensive jokes are being done with lots of originality, tact and charming wit.The other reason why it has such a low Imdb rating could be due to the wrath of the (older adult) english speaking audience who cant stand to watch 2 American actors slaughter every bit of sacredness of the english heritage of Sherlock Holmes. And that sacredness of Sherlock Holmes DOES GET SLAUGHTERED. Bravo! It needed to be slaughtered, to make a fresh new start. To bring back new life to this Sherlock Holmes detective genre, which was nearly bled to death with boring remakes.It is an actor's movie, and I mean that very complimentary. However silly everything may get, there is still lots and lots of good acting to be enjoyed by leading and suporting roles. Ralph Fiennes has a great suporting role and so do many other great English actors.Everything is pretty farcical, but executed with great attention for detail and with marvellous jokes and good acting.Yes, some of the jokes are obnoxious (vomitting, childviolence) but it is done in a very funny way and the obnoxious jokes are only used sparsely.

Rumor has it Bill Murray made the same mistake when he signed up to do the just as god awful Garfield live-action adaption.I herd that this movie is actually based on a Saturday Night Live sketch. Well it's not the first time SNL turned a successful 12min sketch into a 90min disaster (not the first time in a long shot (thinking of MacGruber as the most recent.).

32,jtindahouse,Close to the worst movie I have ever seen,2,28 April 2019,"When you consider the chemistry we know Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly have based on their previous work together, it is almost an impressive feat to make a film this bad starring those two. I've seen some unfunny comedies in my time but it is hard to remember one as terrible as this. Absolutely nothing worked. I kept thinking to myself, what kind of screenwriter wrote this and actually thought it would be funny? How can you think picking up a child's turtle and throwing it as far as you can would ever be worthy of a laugh?Will Ferrell just can not make a good movie lately. He hasn't made a good one since 2010 with 'The Other Guys'. Considering he was undoubtedly the funniest actor working through the 2000s that is quite astonishing. What went so painfully wrong in his career? He doesn't seem to have the same enthusiasm he had back in the early days. Maybe his love of the industry has dissipated, but whatever the reason is he needs to either turn it around quickly or retire because he is seriously ruining his once epic legacy.Even if 'Holmes and Watson' wasn't going to be funny they could have at least put a mildly interesting mystery case into the movie to keep it watchable. But nope, apparently not. A 5-year-old could have come up with the plot they chose to use in this film. I'm not exaggerating when I say this was close to the longest 90 minutes of my life. I have never wanted a film to be over so badly.Were the leads hampered by a PG-13 rating? Possibly, yet that is still no excuse to not even have one funny gag (or even line) in the entire movie. What exactly attracted the two lead actors to take on this project I wonder? Then, as if the film couldn't get any worse, in the last quarter of the runtime they randomly decide to start throwing in some subtle (by which I mean not subtle at all) attacks on President Trump (don't even worry about the film being sets in the 1900s). It is very rare that I ever give a film a rating as low as 2, but there was simply no other option for this abomination. Stay well clear of this one.",Holmes & Watson
33,stevendbeard,Down Right Unfunny,3,29 December 2018,"I saw ""Holmes & Watson"", starring Will Ferrell-The Daddy's Home movies, Elf; John C. Reilly-Kong:Skull Island, Step Brothers; Rebecca Hall-Professor Marston and the Wonder Women, Iron Man 3 and Ralph Fiennes-Spectre, The Grand Budapest Hotel.
This is a very bad movie. It's dumb, silly, political and down right unfunny. I'm not a big fan of Will Ferrell. He is funny sometimes and not so funny other times. This is one of those other times. It's written and directed by Etan Cohen, who had a hand in Get Hard, Men in Black 3 & Tropic Thunder-I don't know what he was smoking or drinking but he must have been blitzed when he wrote this movie. I even heard that after disastrous screen tests, Sony tried to sell the movie to Netflix but they declined. There were a lot of walk outs in theaters during the opening day showings, too. I was tempted myself but I like to give a movie a chance, in case it gets better-but no such luck here. Anyway, Will plays Sherlock Holmes, the great English detective created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and John plays his trusted confidant, Doctor Watson. They are trying to save the Queen of England from being murdered by Ralph, who plays the villainous Moriarty. Rebecca is an American doctor that becomes a love interest for one of the heroes-and if you guessed Will, you would be wrong. I read that it's based on an SNL sketch that Will starred in, back in the day. There are a few cameos but they don't help much. It felt like they were doing the cameos because they owed Will a favor or something. One of the many political jabs taken involved Will putting on hats-one of them said, 'Make England Great Again'.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, drug references, language and sexual material and has a running time of 1 hour & 30 minutes.
It's definitely not one that I would buy on DVD. I wouldn't rent it, either. Even if you are a big Will Ferrell fan, I would wait until it comes to cable tv.",Holmes & Watson

However, Holmes and Watson somehow manages to squander its humor at every turn. What may seem clever on paper, is nearly executed in the worst way possible every time. It is almost brilliant how well the film falls flat so often, and seems most of all to serve as a reminder of how truly awful some comedies can be when you have screenwriters and actors who hardly seem to try. Though he is hardly in the movie, Steve Coogan as the films suspected tattoo artist seems to be the standout in the film, and is the only chuckle-esc moment the film has to offer. The acting is nearly horrible, and terribly on the nose. The film can never decide what it wants to be, how insane it wants to be, how it wants to act, or where it is going. The only positive thing it really has to offer, is a surprisingly fitting setting and set pieces for the background, though in the end some fitting pictures are hardly what makes any film worthwhile.

LIKES:Quick Run Time
Funny At Times
References To Other Versions
Secondary Character Was Funny
The SongSummary: As the reviews come in, you are seeing a lot of negative components, but I can say that despite this not being everyone's cup of tea, the movie at least is short, running around the 1 hour and 20-minute mark, meaning you'll get out of there fairly quickly. In this short film, the movie manages to find some nuggets of well-timed lines that somehow held some wit behind the bantering. Often for me it had to do with the references to other versions of the detective, with nods to the Robert Downey Jr and Benedict Cumberbatch creations that are super popular. When it comes to these moments that is the component that I found the most entertaining. Well that and the secondary character of Millie, whose simplistic bouts of nonverbal comedy had some of the better time laughs than either Ferrell or Reilly could drum up. Of note though, the little song number that Ferrell and Reilly get to perform had some zest to it, so I give them props for including that.DISLIKES:
Paper Thin Story
Mystery Was Boring
Lazy Writing
Too Forced Of Humor
Missed Comedy Opportunities
Fixation on Banter
Diving Down Politically Heated Topics
Summary: Holmes and Watson's first weakness comes from the paper-thin story they tried to sell with the comedy antics. A very simplistic tale that tries to throw in shallow character development and a mystery, this version certainly did not focus its efforts on trying to have something to ground the comedy too. The mystery itself is lackluster and overshadowed by the ridiculousness of the film and given the obvious answer as to whom is the culprit, makes for a plot that will have difficulties standing up to the law of good movies.
Of course, most fans of Ferrell may not really care or expect the story, because he is after all known for being the king of slapstick, banter, and inappropriate comedy. While this movie follows that formula, it's writing did not quite match the quality of other Ferrell flicks and not just because of the missing story. Holmes and Watson had trouble finding its stride, forgoing classic one-liners for mindless banter and arguing between the titular characters, or extended bouts of over the top slapstick that didn't pack the punch the scenes sound effects had. It was comedy that was too forced for me, the lines blunt displays of stating the political injustice we still complain about, which doesn't have the intended prowess it wanted. When those styles failed, they switched to the obsessive self-pleasing jokes that although had good chemistry between actors, again treaded down the gross pathway instead of the funny for me. And the worst part is, all of it is in forced accents, the characters pushing into overdramatic displays of emphasizing the words in very forced accents. All of this boils down to work that either has grown too stale to work in the modern age, or was too forced and lacking the finesse earlier films held.The VERDICT:Holmes and Watson's trailers have not sold you any lies, it's a mess of predictable plot antics with overzealous comedic attempts that the two are famous for. Yet the film does not have the same quality that the duos first film had all those years ago. Is it because the comedy is stale, or is the focus on being too forced of comedy? I don't know the answers, but there is some serious need for plot development and better-balanced comedy to assist for any future installments. As such, the movie missed its mark on a lot of things, needing to step back to the clever tipoffs, and timing than overstuffing the film with comedic banter. Thus, I can't recommend this one for the theater, encouraging to hold out until Netflix picks it up. Sorry guys!My scores are:Adventure/Comedy/Crime: 5.5-6.0

Reilly, Rebecca Hall, Rob Brydon, Ralph Fiennes, Kelly MacDonald, Lauren Lapkus, Steve Coogan, Pam Ferris, Hugh Laurie, Michael Culkin. (PG-13)Broad, anachronistic comedy version of the relationship between Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's indefatigable characters Sherlock Holmes (Ferrell) and Doctor Watson (Reilly); here they try to solve a rather pedestrian murder mystery and assassination plot against the queen. A scattering of laughs in the hit-or-miss early-going, but they dry up quick; far too many dated gags, lame contemporary references (selfies, MAGA hats, ""Unchained Melody,"" etc.), and uninspired slapstick routines sour the experience. Cohen's script is especially lazy, using puerility as a crutch and even botching a Billy Zane cameo. The stars are typically funny together, but they don't even try to play actual characters here (no matter how thinly-defined), and settle on being vaguely dumb, pompous and socially awkward; the supporting cast is littered with talent but they're largely wasted (Lapkus hardly even gets to speak until the denouement).

49,Foutainoflife,Can We Talk About This For A Minute?,4,18 March 2019,"Man, oh man. This is a disappointment. I'd been looking forward to seeing this. Love Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly. They have always played off each other so well and it's been a while since the two were cast together. So, what went wrong with this?To start off, there have been a lot of ""Goofy Detective Duo"" films but I'm not sure that the screenwriters have ever watched any. If I had to choose a classic example of how to do this style of film right, I would have to go with ""The Private Eyes"" (1980) starring Don Knotts and Tim Conway. There has to be a balance of humor, mystery and thrill. This film has made a terrible error of trying too hard to be funny while totally neglecting the actual mystery. The mystery is the driving force of the film and without it you are left with a lot of goofy behavior that goes overboard turning comedy into awkwardness.Don't get me wrong. While I am disappointed, Farrell and Reilly still know how to play off each other and I did see that a few times. It is good to see them on the screen together and I hope that the trip up of this film will not dissuade them from trying to make another film.The takeaway is that this film is a fail.

53,bankofmarquis,They can't all be winners,4,27 April 2020,"Well...they can't all be winners.I know that Will Ferrell is an ""acquired taste"" - either you like the ""all in"" comedy of this man, or you don't. I happen to like Ferrell, his comedy has aged on me like a fine wine. I find that some of his most recent films like THE OTHER GUYS and THE HOUSE are very funny (maybe not as funny as ANCHORMAN...but what is). I think this comedian still has his fastball.But, sometimes, wine doesn't age well, it turns into vinegar. And for Ferrell, this vinegar is the comedic dud that is HOLMES & WATSON.Partnering with familiar on-screen partner John C. Reilly (who paired with Ferrell in films like STEP BROTHERS and TALLEDEGA NIGHTS) this film is a parody of the multitude of Sherlock Holmes films - this time showing that not only is Holmes and idiot but so is Watson. But, somehow, they manage to solve the crime and save the day anyway.Ferrell is (typically) over-the-top and obtuse as Holmes. Usually, this combination works for him (see ANCHORMAN) but it just falls flat here. Same thing for John C. Reilly's Watson - he is just as over-the-top and obtuse and (I think) that's the beginning of the problem here. The two just bounce off each other without the joke landing on either of them - nor does it land of the audience.Ralph Fiennes (Moriarty), Rebecca Hall (potential girlfriend), Rob Brydon (Inspector Lestrade) and Kelly Macdonald (Mrs. Hudson) all fair poorly with poor material to work with.Writer/Director Etan (that's Etan, not Ethan) Cohen (IDIOCRACY) does nothing to help things here with either his writing or his direction. My only thought here is that he thought that Ferrell and Reilly could improvise themselves into a good film.It didn't happen.Letter Grade: C (because I guffawed out loud - despite myself - a couple of times)4 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Holmes & Watson

58,cardsrock,Truly abysmal,3,11 January 2019,"What a waste. Ferrell and Reilly's previous team-ups were great, so it seems the lack of Adam McKay is the deciding factor here.

59,CANpatbuck3664,BIG Swing and a Miss From Ferrell and the Gang,4,27 December 2018,"I loved Will Ferrell's comedies as a teenager, the original Anchorman and Talladega Nights might be among my favourite comedies of all time. The last Will Ferrell comedy I really loved was The Other Guys. As the years have gone by, I haven't outgrown his movies, but I've realized Will always pulls from the same bag of tricks. When he has some decent material, you can count on him to be funny (the movies I mentioned above, Stranger Than Fiction) but if there's a crappy script or nothing to build off (Get Hard, The House, Daddy's Home 2) he just flails around and embarrasses himself. I don't want to let John C. Reily, Rebecca Hall, Lauren Lapkas, Ralph Fiennes or Steve Coogan off the hook either. None of them come out of this looking good, I felt sorry for them, but they took the cheque and agreed to be in this. I don't like to blame actors and actresses for a movie's failing, especially when its evident they didn't have material to work with, but this movie falls so flat it is embarrassing and nobody elevated themselves beyond the material.A lot of the material for the comedy isn't period accurate, there's jokes around things like selfies and outright allusions to Donald Trump (which I normally would have laughed at, but it was too obvious). That's okay but they contrast that with decent looking sets and costuming to make the movie relatively accurate to the setting in time. This movie had a decent budget and they put it to good use. It makes the movie seem off and pulls the movie out of the decent work that the set designers, makeup artists and wardrobe did.With all this complaining, you might think I'm a Sherlock Holmes purist or offended by the idea of a parody of Arthur Conan Doyle's work. This isn't accurate, I really dug the Robert Downey Jr. version of Sherlock Holmes and the Benedict Cumberbatch/Martin Freeman show. These characters are ripe for a comedic take but Holmes & Watson reeks of improv comedy. That can work but this probably wasn't the right property to do that with. This movie also does every gross-out joke including one where Watson is lactating from poison. Again, gross-out humour can work but it needs to be done with some tact and this felt like just pandering to the lowest common denominator.By the halfway point I was embarrassed to be in the theatre watching this. I'm not above admitting that I chuckled a few times, mostly from jokes delivered by Rebecca Hall and John C. Reily but this was probably the worst movie I saw this year. The stuff that falls flat doesn't just awkwardly hit the ground, it burrows into it. I was hoping that Ferrell and Reily working together again would break Ferrell's recent streak but that didn't end up being the case. Avoid this at all costs whether you're a Sherlock fan or not, I'm giving this a 3.5/10 rounding up to a 4/10.",Holmes & Watson
60,Beejerman,JEER - (3 stars out of 10),3,22 April 2019,"The stage curtains open ...After strong outings together in ""Talladega Nights"" and ""Step Brothers"", this third movie starring both Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly is a head-shaking disappointment (and yes, I know John C. Reilly has an uncredited role in the second Anchorman movie, but I don't count that). Though the film has its moments, they are very few and very far in between. Ferrell and Reilly come off as stumble bums in their roles ... not funny, and not invested.The film starts with a small segment showing Sherlock Holmes as a young boy and the bullying he received from his classmates, causing him to become the emotionless, yet intellectual giant that he was. Okay ... so far, so good. Not a bad start. Enter Ferrell as the modern day Holmes and Reilly as the modern day Watson - and almost immediately, the movie deflates with antiquated gags and jokes that hardly raises an eyebrow. It falls upon these two to root out a conspiracy to take the Queen's life and discredit Holmes at the same time.This movie fails on so many levels and was truly a big disappointment, especially considering their previous work together which was fresh and funny. In this film, Ferrell and Reilly seemed to be more concerned with trying to make things LOOK funny instead of just letting them BE funny. Staging and posturing is the order of the day - nothing flows naturally in the movie. It is completely stilted and forced. The script is terrible, the jokes are old and just plain bad.This is not a recommend. In fact, I would recommend for you to pass on it. If you are a die hard Will Ferrell or John C. Reilly fan, then I can understand your wanting to see this - as I wanted to, even though it was receiving bad reviews. This is one of the worst movies that either of these two have ever made - and certainly the worst one that they've made together.",Holmes & Watson
61,Java_Joe,Lazy and unfunny.,1,1 October 2019,"Honestly I don't get the appeal of Will Farrell. He's just not funny. And while John C Reilly can do decently if given the proper direction, he's wasted here in this movie.This is supposed to be a spoof about Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. In it Holmes is a complete narcissist who believes himself to be a great detective because the press says he is. And Watson is reduced to singing Holmes' praises and being abused by him at all turns.If you've seen their back and forth in other movies you won't be surprised here. If you haven't and this is your first time, then prepare to be disappointed because it's just not funny.To put this into perspective the producers knew this was a dog and wanted to sell it to Netflix because they tend to jump at any chance to get original movies. Netflix turned them down because they felt it was too stupid. Netflix turned them down. This is the same company that produced and showed Adam Sandler's ""The Ridiculous 6"". A movie so bad that I don't know anybody who actually likes it. When the low bar for what you'll take and what you won't is an Adam Sandler movie then you know it's time to pack it in.",Holmes & Watson

71,DuskShadow,WHy do people never appreciate all the effort?,5,7 January 2019,"So what one will about this film, but it had some hilarious parts, and plenty of good old fashioned , just plain funny in an good enough way, parts.
The amount of attention to detail for the clothing, the scenery, everything was a testament to the determination to make a movie set in the late 19th century, England. Following loosely along with the latter Holmes tale concerning the ever present villain Moriarty, THe ffort was there, yet at times the pacing felt off and the acting of everyone present was not good enough. Opinions vary on so many matters, and speaking personally the combination of Farrell and Riley was not the best duo I have ever see, but this movie was in my mind, again, due to the effort therein, at least better than the pile that was step brothers. I really was so bored with that film. Again, the comparison is not meant to make one think this film is that worth paying for, and it felt kinda hollow after the movie was over, and that the film had been more of an filler for the 3rd real Sherlock moive that Robert Downy Jr just hasnt been able to make cause of the shackles marvel/ Disney has on him. BEen a while since I saw a flick that NEEDED nudity in it, but then pg 13 films these last couple years have been a monumental disappointment, so its no surprise.

74,deepfrieddodo,Silly Slapstick Sherlock,3,9 May 2021,"I watched out of curiosity, but this was as terrible as everyone says. Scenes include continuous vomiting, getting attacked by killer bees, and sensually massaging a cadaver. It's humour that's better suited to the likes of Family Guy, as it was not funny in the least. The whole terrible display stems from the awful script. The lead duo's chemistry isn't bad by any means, but without anything to work with its wasted. The whole plot is pieced together by random skits of slapstick and bodily fluids. Even as a 'period' piece, it dates itself with unnecessary references to Donald Trump, i-Hop, and selfies. The wider acting was okay though, good costume department too. The real question is how on earth they got any of the big name actors to agree to star in this mess.",Holmes & Watson
75,ginocox-206-336968,A few laughs overshadowed by groaners and misfires,2,12 March 2019,"Holmes & Watson (2018) offers a few genuine laughs, but they are overshadowed by groaners and misfires. To the film's credit, it attempts to find humor at various levels and in various forms, from subtle situational irony to physical burlesque. One viewer's groaner may be another's belly laugh. For me, the fool-triumphant gags worked best, while the most tedious were the clumsy political commentaries and the homoerotic humor. The anachronisms were misses more often than hits, although one involving a camera and another a telegram were amusing. The movie tries too hard to make Sherlock Holmes into Will Ferrell, rather than making Will Ferrell into a caricature of Sherlock Holmes. Neither ever becomes sympathetic or likeable, as do Johnny English and Inspector Jacques Clouseau. The opening scene, where they meet, presents both as unlikeable with no chemistry between them. For that matter, none of the central characters comes off as particularly likeable.Part of the problem is that Watson (John C. Reilly) becomes the protagonist, while Holmes becomes a comic sidekick for much of the film. Watson's character arc is more akin to that of a protagonist. Often in adventure films, the sidekick saves the hero. Here, it is Holmes who must rescue Watson. Watson also does much of the hard lifting in defeating the villain.Some elements are allowed to go to waste. The Baker Street Irregulars are often present, but don't do much of anything. Usually, there is a character who realizes the protagonist is really a buffoon, such as Commissioner Dreyfus and Bough, but H&W has no straight man, other than Inspector Lestrade, who seems more frustrated with Holmes than in on the joke.Production values are excellent. The actors are talented and do as well as might be expected with the material they're given. Writer/Director Etan Cohen has been involved in funnier and more entertaining projects, including Tropic Thunder and Men in Black 3. He was also writer/director on Get Hard. Despite occasional laughs, much of H&W simply isn't funny.",Holmes & Watson

I counted several laughs in the first half hour and then the pace slowly begins to decline as the story gets weaker and weaker. That there is a little-used cast is obvious; The talent of several stars is wasted and it is a great shame. Despite this, the tone is light and there are several moments where we see tributes to other films and for a cinephile that is welcome. One of the problems is Will Ferrell's make-up as it is frightening because of the extreme. It seems that the closing was rushed and the film could have been lengthened with ten more minutes (believe or not believe). Still not the worst movie of that year not much less.",Holmes & Watson

I won't deny that it has its moments, very few, but moments nonetheless where it succeeded in making me burst out a few laughs. It's a parody, I watch it and took it for what it is, not expecting to be hilarious and have some sort of deep story.Some users in here took it very seriously, and completely bashed this film harshly writing reviews that seem to be pages long; I mean come on, it's a Sherlock Holmes parody where Will Ferrell is Sherlock Holmes.

Honestly, before I went to see it I knew what it was going to be and got was I was expecting out of a Will Ferrell comedy. Yeah, not all the jokes work and the writing could be better for sure, but I also got quite a few genuine laughs out of it in places too and think the chemistry and banter between Ferrell and Reilly's characters were great, as well as the casting and production side of things. I really liked the musical number in the movie and yeah it was stupid but I wasn't expecting like a smart comedy or anything. If you were expecting it to be one then that's not a good idea at all!I remember coming out of the cinema thinking ""That wasn't nearly as terrible as everyone was making it out to be"" and quite frankly, it's no way near the bottom of my 2018 movies rankings.

Where's the funny Will Ferrell? Did he die and get replaced with this unfunny, messy version of him? Adam McKay needs to stop producing his horrible films and start writing and directing them for him again, even then I don't really know if Farrell can even pull it off anymore. It's sad, because I loved Will Ferrell as a kid with films like Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, and even Step Brothers. I want the Will Farrell who could pull off a role like Buddy in Elf. I don't think he could ever repeise that role as he is now.",Holmes & Watson
86,kingofdanerds,Made me laugh because of how god awful and dumb it is,3,16 November 2020,"I am a huge fan of the earlier Will Ferrell and John C. Reily films Talledega Nights and Step Brothers with the latter being one of my favorite comedies of all time. Around 2018, there were rumors (but only rumors and not even good ones) about a possible sequel to Step Brothers. When I saw a trailer showing clips from Step Brothers, I was estatic. And then I was dissappointed..... Not because it the trailer was bad (and it was) but rather because I would rather have had a sequel to Step Brothers rather than this film. Holmes and Watson was released on December 25th of 2018 and the film was pretty much panned by critics and audiences. I could not tell you how many stories I heard of people walking out and stories of what movie theaters did in response to this movie being a pile of garbage. Though, I tried to keep an open mind. It would not be until nearly two years after this film's release that I decided to buy this film on DVD and watch it. Was it a waste of seven bucks? Perhaps... but at least I have the Holy Trinity of Will Ferrell and John C. Reily films.The film follows Sherlock Holmes (played by Will Ferrell) and Watson (played by John C. Reily) who are investingating a murder that happened at Buckingham Palace. All kinds of dumb stuff happen and well.... that is pretty much it.I honestly try my best to give a brief description of the film without making it sound bad, but this film does make it very hard for me. With that being said, this movie is bad but bad in the way that an Adam Sandler movie is bad. It makes me laugh, but only due to it's absurdity. Nothing is really clever about the humor at all and the only way that one can somewhat enjoy it is by taking your mind off of everything else and just focus on the movie and at least keep an open mind about what you are watching. I did exactly that. I am not mad for watching this film. The comedy is fairly strange. First thing that this film opens up with is a fake Hannah Montana quote. Due to it's absurdity, I laughed at it. This film does that a lot where it makes references to things today. The only problem is that this film takes place in the late 1800's and it is a problem when this film decides to have the Titanic in it. Wow..... great job movie. Clearly, this movie was not made for the intellectuals. Some of the jokes drag on for a long time and there are pointless scenes that add nothing to the story other than to make an attempt to make people laugh. Nothing is really memorable about this film. Will Ferrell and John C. Reily give a performance that is bad and honestly it feels like they improvised all of their lines. Stuff like this was funny in Step Brothers but in here, it is not really funny. Will Ferrell plays the worst Sherlock Holmes ever and that might be the joke here. For a smart guy, Sherlock Holmes is really dumb. Sherlock Holmes stories in general are supposed to make your mind think and here, there is no mystery. There is not even a big focus on it in my opinion. When the ""mystery"" is solved, it is not very satisfactory and it is dumb. Professor Moriarty is supposed to be a very smart bad guy in Sherlock Holmes stories and he is not used at all in this film. Which just makes the ending even dumber. I will go ahead and complain again about how modern references are in this film. The whole soundtrack is your typicall bad rap hip hop music that is in every bad comedy. Ugh...Holmes and Watson is a bad film. It is far from being the worst comedy ever (films like the Larry the Cable Guy movies are such examples). I would not even say that it is even close. Rating it a two would mean that the film made me laugh once and I laughed more than once. So a three star rating shall suffice.",Holmes & Watson

Feminists hated for the female jokes. Trump supporters didn't appreciate the stab at the current boy in charge... and English people got very angry for all bellow the belt English jokes ( which are hilarious!!!)Lighten up people. Learn to understand what dark humor and comedy is! If you look pass all the politics and just enjoy the subtle humor, you will LOVE this funny movie! It is very funny. It won't win awards, but it will make you smile if you are into that kind of stuff.

91,snowfre,The only mystery here is why anyone would distribute this,2,13 January 2020,"I think many anticipated ""Holmes and Watson"" as it would reunite the ""Stepbrothers"" duo of Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly. This time, they would take on the Arthur Conan Doyle's legendary private detective Sherlock Holmes in Victorian England. The result is a horrendously badly written movie with great many lows and barely any highs. Ferrell plays the consulting detective Sherlock Holmes as he tries to solve a series of murders, possibly committed by the Napoleon of Crime (played by Ralph Fiennes with about one speaking line). That's the plot, but it doesn't seem very important, as 95% of the film seems to consist of incoherent comedy sketches, giving you the feeling that writer Etan Cohen has no idea how to transfer ideas for humorous scenes into the overall storyline of the film. Now, will you laugh watching ""Holmes and Watson""? Occasionally. I would lie if I said Ferrell didn't breath comedy whenever he appears, and he alone is the only reason I'm not ranking this absolute failure of a mystery comedy one star. His overly stereotype British English vocabulary is amusing yes, but it can't measure up for ""Holmes and Watson""'s missed opportunity of taking this classic character and create a contemporary comedy classic such as Basil Rathborne. This is an absolute letdown of a movie.",Holmes & Watson
92,iguth,Doo-doo,1,6 May 2019,"I read somewhere that people were walking out of the theatre during this movie, and I know exactly why. This movie is really not good. It is hard to say just what is bad about this movie because the list would be so large. Lighting, writing, acting?, plot, etc. It is 100% a comedy with a fine plot with Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly but it is inherently flawed. The best version of
Sherlock Holmes has always been when he is smart, unsociable and charming, not a bumbling idiot. Not only that but it is not funny. The jokes are not funny. I laughed once because of some side characters. It isn't funny. Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly were wasted. It is not funny. Don't watch it, it's so not worth the hour and a half.",Holmes & Watson
93,torrascotia,Actually quite funny.,6,12 March 2019,"Everyone knows this was destroyed by critics for some very silly reasons. There were reports of walk out. But I like to make up my own mind and I don't mind sitting through a bad movie if it's so bad it's laughable.
The first complaint about this movie was it's simply not funny. That's simply not true. It has a silly tone to it much like any Ferrell movies. It simply has a lower budget but if you like that kind of humour you will probably like this. It's not simply a funny movie it's a pastiche of Sherlock movies. And it works. It takes aim at the Downey Jr vehicle and when it does these scenes are hilarious.
Despite it not being a big budget movie the cast has UK comedy royalty. It was also great to hear a genuine Scottish accent by Kelly MacDonald of trainspotting fame. This movie will probably play better in the UK than the US due to the acting talent involved.
There were some complaints this was anti-Trump. It's clearly not. There is one part where they joke about the electoral system but of course this applies to any elected president. The jokes are neither pro or con any political side, so to suggest this as a reason it's a bad movie is completely false.
If you enjoyed other Ferrel movies give it a go, it's not big budget by any means but as a parody of Sherlock Holmes movies it works very well. It's elementary that some of the hate is from Sherlock fans who do not like their hero ridiculed. Decent despite the negative hype.",Holmes & Watson
94,phoenixinvictus,Painful to watch,1,13 March 2019,"It's not even funny. It seems that Will Farrell has lost his talent for comedy by using the same formula over and over again. I did try to watch this to the end and stopped when he broke out in song. The character of Sherlock Holmes is inconsistent throughout the entire movie. One moment he is a deductive genius and the next moment he is an idiot who stumbles upon himself. Watson's character is no better and it left me sad to see these two characters turned into fools for the sake of a couple of cheap gags. As the years have gone by I keep finding myself discovering that the newer comedy is not as funny as it used to be. It seems daft to me the attempts that comedians go to make the audience laugh these days. Homophobia, misogyny, drug abuse and physical abuse are not funny-in fact these things are crimes-but for some reason Hollywood insists in shoving this garbage to the viewer. The studios love it because it costs them very little and they expect huge profits with a formula that is outdated.",Holmes & Watson
95,pokemon_trainer_lucas,I don't know why everyone's complaining!,7,21 June 2019,"I was sat at the back of the cinema screen, and I could see that 3 people walked out half way through, although I don't know why. Maybe they went expecting to see a serious take on Sherlock Holmes? Or maybe they just can't appreciate sarcastic comedy?
This film made me laugh out loud on more than one occasion, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It wasn't meant to be a serious film, and the comedy was meant to be forced and spoof-like. That's just the type of comedy that it was! That's why I don't understand why some people are complaining so much. I mean, fair enough if that's not your style of humour, but that doesn't mean it deserves a 1 star.",Holmes & Watson
96,TheMovieDoctorful,Just As Bad As It Looks,1,10 January 2019,"As someone who considers Step Brothers one of the funniest films ever made, I knew what I was getting myself into when I bought a ticket to go see Holmes & Watson. This was neither going to be Will Ferrell at his prime, nor was it going to be John C. Reilly trying his hardest. However, with the insane critical backlash this one was getting, akin to legendarily bad comedies like Gigli or Chairman of the Board, I almost felt I had an obligation to see this. My Top 10 Worst of the Year list wouldn't be complete without it. In that respect, Holmes & Watson does not disappoint. It's stunningly awful.The best Will Ferrell comedies are the ones where all of the cast members have a genuine chemistry. They're all working and acting together to get the best comedic moments out of one another. Ferrell's presence inspires and rouses his fellow cast members, but he never tries to steal the limelight from them. Here, Ferrell and Reilly are pretty much in a competition to see who can scream the loudest (There is literally a scene where the comedic duo yells uninterrupted at the top of their lungs for a full minute. I recall myself slinking farther and farther into my chair the longer it went on.) The synergy these 2 had in Step Brothers and Talladega Nights is gone; they aren't acting off of each other, they're just trying to be as over-the-top and absurd as possible on their own. And it doesn't work at all.Ferrell and Reilly also seem to have no idea when to just let their jokes end. There are numerous grating, dragging, painfully unfunny running gags present here; one about Ferrell Sherlock vomiting at a morgue, one about Reilly Watson touching The Queen's hand, one about how eating onions like apples is good for your health. Every one of them is a chore to sit through and goes on far longer than it has too. Even a joke about Ferrell Sherlock poisoning Reilly Watson to test his potential as a detective that starts out pretty funny becomes unbearable by the time its run its course, with Reilly Watson giving unfunny poses and lactating his nipples...I'm as shocked as you are they botched a joke that badly.The whole premise is so confused. Sometimes, it wants to play on the idea that Sherlock Holmes is intelligent to a ridiculous, almost nonsensical degree; think the intellectual equivalent of Zohan Dvir. Other times, it's just Will Ferrell doing the blithering manchild act. There's no consistency between it, no actual direction that this character is going towards. Ferrell playing a comedic take on Sherlock Holmes is an admittedly intriguing premise, but my God, the movie has no idea where to go with it.It's also worth noting just how bad the ADR work is. Characters will frequently have dialogue that doesn't match up with their mouth movements, synced in a way that would be unacceptable in a student film. It completely reeks of a total lack of effort with the studio saying ""To Hell with it, reshoots are too hard! Bring the cast to the recording studio to dub over their lines and if it kinda/sorta/not really fits, it's good enough!""I thought Robin Hood (2018) and The Darkest Minds were pathetic in their attempts at social commentary. That was before I watched Holmes & Watson, a movie that literally feels the need to mention Donald Trump by name (""You have the electoral college, which would surely prevent some Trump of a charlatan from gaining power!"") This is, of course, after a reference to fake news, Ferrell Holmes wearing a red ""Make England Great Again"" hat and Rebecca Hall's character going off about how America would never elect a ""wealthy tyrant who cares for nothing but himself"" (A line that she, amusingly, seems almost pained to deliver) and this precedes Ferrell Holmes and Reilly Watson explaining how they'd want a ""strong businessman"" and a ""showman"" for President. I swear to you, I was dangerously close to screaming in the theater at this part.There are also times where Holmes & Watson feels oddly Seltzer & Friedberg-like in its comedy, making pop culture references seemingly out of thin air just because it can. In a scene where Reilly Watson has to fight a strongman in the ring in order to arrest Moriarty (Don't ask), Ferrell Holmes, out of nowhere, starts telling the audience they need to ""pay to view"" the event. And then Michael Buffer shows up to kickstart the actual fight. It felt like a cut scene from Disaster Movie and marks one of the worst comedic scenes I've ever watched.Other comedic lowlights include Holmes & Watson taking the first selfie with the Queen, Sherlock Holmes calculating the projection of his piss while drunk, a small child kissing a donkey's behind...It's bad. It's really bad, as bad as you can possibly imagine. I'll confess to laughing pretty hard at Ferrell Sherlock's speech about how Reilly Watson's actions allowed the Titanic to make its first voyage (""When you think of your friends and relatives on board the Titanic, just remember, Dr. John H. Watson put them there!"") and there are a couple of other moments that are moderately funny (Reilly Watson trying to get rid of bees by shooting them, Rebecca Hall's medical achievements involving exorcising demons, an amusing Billy Zane cameo...Probably some others that I'm not remembering), but nothing that makes this worthy of watching. Stay away unless you need room on your worst list for one more movie.(All that being said, I still hate it less than The Incredible Burt Wonderstone and Bad Teacher.)",Holmes & Watson
97,corkey38,Definitely The Worst Movie Of 2018,1,27 June 2019,"Will Ferrell and John McGinley team up together as Detective Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson respectively on this film,""Holmes & Watson"". It tells the story of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's literary work in comedic fashion. It tells the story of how Detective Holmes and Dr. Watson try to solve a murder mystery.As they try to deduce and figure out who committed the crime,jokes come along the way to elicit laughter from the viewer watching the film.Unfortunately,the film falters as the jokes are stupid,idiotic, and unfunny.Added to that,we the get lost along the way as the story it tells become incomprehensible as it shoves jokes into the viewer's throat. Too bad that anyone watching this film will be more concerned with keeping track with the time when it is going to end rather than what is going on in the movie.It won the 2018 Razzie Worst Picture of the Year. No question that it truly deserves it.",Holmes & Watson
98,sakram,Not an empty movie after all,5,15 March 2019,"I went into this with really low expectations after all the negative reviews. It turned out that the comedy was using unoriginal stink and gross jokes including feces, pee, puke and whatnot.It had a few good and original moments, but they're not very numerous. Another pro would be that it actually has a plot, and the character play their roles well at least. But too bad such an important was wasted, this would have delivered such a cannon.I can't believe that the one who wrote these jokes got hundreds of grands of money5/10, didn't bore me at least.",Holmes & Watson
99,cwade22,Will ferrell IS NOT FUNNY!,1,12 July 2020,"Forcing things in comedy is NEVER funny! Will ferrell has a habit of forcing things to try to get laughs. It never made me laugh! Never! The ONLY time i laughed at will ferrell was in austin powers and he fell over the cliff and was in pain, but even then he forced it and over did it!The only funny parts in this movie were WITHOUT will ferrell! Like when Watson was in morgue with the lady spoofing the Clay sculpting scene from Ghost. The vomiting part at morgue was prime example of how Will ferrell forces things. It wasn't funny and as i watched i wondered ""does anybody laugh when he does this stuff?"" The concept of making Sherlock holmes a comedy may work, but without will ferrell! I dont want to hate him but his style of comedy is the type i avoid. It's almost like three stooges, as they used abuse on themselves to get laughs. Stop forcing comedy. It wont work. And if you force it, make it look effortless.I feel bad for the people who went to cinema and paid for this! Lol.What do i find funny? Crude stuff like family guy, American Dad's Roger the gay alien, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS lotion scene! Lol! Seriously! ""RUB THE LOTION ON IT'S SKIN!"" Funniest movie line of the 1990's! Well, of 1991 or whenever that film was released. Will ferrell has never been funny to me. Im half black so maybe that's why. It seems only white liberal types think he's funny. Same white liberals who love the office which IS NOT FUNNY! The Office is not funny! Who told these stale, corny white dudes they were funny?! My toilet sees more comedy than they make!WHO FINANCED THIS TERRIBLE MOVIE?! So many QUALITY film concepts never get funded but THIS JUNK GETS MONEY?! Again, what fools gave money to this?! How does junk like this keep getting made but quality gets denied?! And the idiots running hollywood expect me to be a sucker and pay to see this?! I dont even want to watch for free! I cant watch this whole movie. I cant! 40 minutes into it and i'm DONE! If ROWAN ATKINSON were cast instead of Will ferrell, IT WOULD'VE BEEN HILARIOUS! Will ferrell doesn't understand comedy! STOP GIVING HIM MONEY! Stop encouraging this unfunny, forceful style. It's not funny! HE CAN'T EVEN DO AN UPPER CLASS BRITISH DIALECT! He's a ""professional"" and has money, gets paid and can't pay for dialect classes to get that dialect?! I can even do it and Im a Half black American from the South!

""What horrible secrets do the producers know about Will Ferrel and John C. Reilly for them to sign onto this movie???"" and ""Did we really just blow $16 to recline comfortably and absolutely no other reason?""

I don't get what all the hate was about. Sure, there are some pretty dumb moments, but I was mostly laughing throughout. It's basically a silly/slapstick comedy, which is clear from the trailer.Also, I didn't see any of the ""sloppy editing"" and ""shots out of focus"" that's listed in the trivia, and I don't get why people would have walked out en masse as claimed. I've seen far worse.All in all I don't know what people were expecting, but if you liked Farrell and Reilly together previously then you'll likely enjoy this as well.

John Reilly is actually a talented actor (from Gangs of New York to Chicago to The Aviator, and What's Eating Gilbert Grape, and more), so I have to assume the writing and directing on this just were simply awful that he couldn't make this thing NOT stink! Ferrell certainly CAN be funny, but this sure probably was his worst movie yet (and yes.. the guy has had some bad movies.. AND some really funny movies too!) I think movie studios should start offering refunds for people who don't like the movie. If they did, this would honestly be the 4th movie I'd ever want a refund for seeing!

But either way, I knew this movie would be terrible the moment I heard that song ""The Boys are Back in Town"" in the preview. I knew it would be bad since they had already been over-advertising it, but that song made me realize they're desperately trying to market the amazing comedy duo from Step Brothers and Talladega Nights. When you have the names Ferrell and Reilly side by side again, that should be enough to draw a huge crowd. Unless word spreads that your movie is a complete pile of crap, which this absolutely was. So I guess it makes sense the marketing team would try to save face and make a little bit of the budget back by revolving the trailers around ""the boys"", but this movie is still painfully unfunny.

I propose a series of Star Wars satire's, like Austin Powers; to really alienate all the weirdo internet movie critiques, clicks.The absurdity of Sherlock Holmes being a mind numbed dumb, dumb, and yet being right all the time; as the movie takes off, is genius.

They took a British classic and used it's to spew their ingnorace of half of America. The only thing I can think is that Hollywood is such a circle jerk of thought, they actually believe the world thinks like them. They are obviously are not following the news about the country of France rioting in the streets screaming for their President to be ousted and replaced with the American President.Producers should have known, but will soon find out just how sick of this drivel the American people and World is. Will Ferrell and company embarrassed themselves on the world stage ripping their home country. It's like listening to someone making classless jokes about their wife for 90 minutes with her sitting there, it's boorish, uncomfortable, and most certainly not funny.I predict this will not recoup it's investment, and that you will not see these ""comedians' and their 'director' in any main stream movies for awhile. They will only find work doing voice-overs because losers are not bankable, and producers, the ones that paid for this, DO NOT like losing money.Walt Disney said, why sell two tickets when you can sell four with a G rating. They wanted increase the amount potential buyers. 80% of America was married with two children. This production crew has reduce their possible of sale to 15%.

How it weaves both post-irony and irony it confuses both audiences. As post-irony their failure was a rousing success. As irony. The consequence of hollywood's success dilutes the global culture as post-American. Meaning, Bush/Obama era idiocy and lampooning western prosperity expired with Trump where the lampoon became the story. So its subversion is life already, and then it's not useful. Look how it delivers the most preposterous rendition of its brand, because no one can tell the shades apart. The brand functions outside its delivery. This is very 21st century is the streamlining of brand. With its 'wearing of hats' as identity exchange which is transient about appearance selling the lie. The product is always the same it's just different hats. Like Taco Bell the same food across one hundred items on the menu but in different shapes. Holmes's convolutions were so frequently wrong but his associative non-linear thoughts were consistent with his brand, so still viable by the societal forces. ""It's Holmes so it must be right."" Apply this to everything and we have the vessel for complete societal failure. Moriarty was not Moriarty, Watson was not Watson, reality is not reality. None of it's plausible but it becomes real because he said it. It's the thinking itself, an entire film about funny ways of thinking, which is wonderfully abstract.",Holmes & Watson

163,TheJohnnyPHreak,Netflix Wouldn't Even Take This,2,6 January 2019,"I don't know how this film got made. Was it the fact that Will Farrell and John C Reilly had two huge movies beforehand? Did Sony really think it was a guarantee to win with these two? Talladega Nights is so good (I like the extended version better) and Step Brothers is one of the most quoted films of all time. But that doesn't mean every film with them is going to do well. Even if this film came out five years ago I don't think it would have helped.I'll admit I enjoyed the first trailer. Then the reviews came out. Then that infamous time when the film had a 0% on Rotten Tomatoes. I never trust Rotten Tomatoes but that's hard to get out of the head. Could the film be as bad as the word of mouth? Yes, it can be. I actually think it might be worse.Farrell and Reilly star as Holmes and Watson. They are tasked with protecting Queen when a new threat emerges as classic villain Moriarty has fled to America. Goofiness ensues, but goofiness started the film and finishes the film. This is not a direct parody of the Guy Ritchie film but it might as well be. There is a running gag of Holmes strategizing specific situation before he takes actions. It gets old after about the second time.That's the issue with the film. There are about five jokes that are recycled throughout the film. Most offensive is the joke about women doctors when Rebecca Hall and Lauren Lapkus show up. Every time they show up it's ""you are women, you can't be doctors"". Even five years ago this joke wouldn't be funny. Ralph Fiennes plays the Moriarty role in what plays out like an extended cameo. Steve Coogan also has a useless cameo. I'm not sure if Farrell just asked some friends to be in the movie or they were actually cast in the film.Most of the film features current jokes or somewhat current jokes played out in this time period. There is a one the nose joke about the political climate today, where one of the characters nearly breaks the fourth wall to stare into the camera to tell the audience something. It's not creative, but obvious and needless. I don't know if the creators thought the audience would be so stupid they needed to be beaten over the head with ideas. The film gives off the aura that they wanted to make a Mel Brooks type spoof film. But the film comes off in the laziest spoof of all time. With the talent around the film, it's not disappointing but more embarrassing.Holmes and Watson is a predictable, jokes that all fall flat film, that I think Sony just dumped to get out. The rumor is that Sony offered it to Netflix and they turned it down. That's pretty rough if Netflix who usually takes everything turned down an offer to stream the film. That's not a good sign at all. This is definitely the worst film for the duo and might go down as the worst film either of the main actors has been in. There is nothing redeeming about the film. No saving grace and silvering lining to actually venture out to see this. (Even if it was streaming, I think most people would have only watched it to see how awful it as)",Holmes & Watson

165,CinematicGarbage,More like a Sherlock Holmes parody!,1,28 April 2019,"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels are really popular nowadays, people are reading it everywhere but when Holmes and Watson (2018) was realeased, almost everything had changed. The movie was quite like a joke, everything was funny and I didn't expect it to be like this.
There were Will Ferrell and John C. Reily in the film being Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson. The make-up was really terrible, Will Ferrell looked nothing like Sherlock Holmes, more like a Sherlock Holmes in a parody. I mean did they even watch Sherlock Holmes (2009) starring Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law? They were more like those characters. Doctor Watson in this movie was just pranking around. Not a good acting.
The plot was terrible as well. Everything was jokes, even when Holmes accused Watson of being guilty was like a joke too. The song to rescue Watson was worse. The references in here were not good: Albert Einstein and Harry Houdini? Why do they have to be in this movie? This is the United Kingdom!!
Nothing was special in the scenes, but the jokes and humor were okay. Other scenes were really boring. From the start to finish, it was always terrible and a mess. For Sherlock Holmes Fans, don't watch this if you don't want to hate Sherlock Holmes because this movies would give you motivation to detest Sherlock Holmes.

169,cinemawithcj,Holmes & Watson - Cinema with CJ Review,1,31 December 2018,"Holmes and Watson does not offer high hopes going into it. The film currently sits at 6% on Rotten Tomatoes and at one point had the dreadful honour of being completely at 0%.Watching it confirms the fact that it is entirely rotten. Which is an absolute shame. Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly are comedy greats and usually together their humour is multiplied...but clearly the problem lies in the script and direction.Both duties fall under Etan Cohen, not to be confused with Joel and Ethan Coen and definitely not to be confused with Joel Cohen, writer of Garfield. Of all the Coen/Cohen's in Hollywood, we've found our Paul W.S. Anderson equivalent.Previously the filmmaker behind Ferrell vehicle Get Hard, it's amazing to see someone get worse, particularly this worse.Holmes and Watson has all the trappings of a Sherlock Holmes story and all the trappings of a potentially great comedy handled with the grace of the Running of the Bulls through the World's Largest China Shop. So inefficient and unfunny, it's definitely not great when you look around at the silence caused by the severe lack of jokes in the minutes before the opening credits (except one person in my screening, but there's always gonna be one intergalactic alien trying to fit in as a secret human).The film is severely bland and lacking, full of choices that seem completely misguided. Ferrell decides to put on a strange accent for Holmes that doesn't work at all, and Reilly's Watson is overly and unfunnily violent, yet these are choices never dissuaded by the director, which is concerning.Holmes and Watson has a story, if you can believe that, one where Moriarty (played by the criminally underused and probably overpaid Ralph Fiennes) has a presence, but is harshly pushed to the side in favour of an invisible antagonist you can figure out by spoilers by billing.On a completely unrelated note, Kelly MacDonald is in this movie and she continues to be brilliant and brilliantly Scottish in the things that she makes, and while her character is there for a bunch of anachronistic jokes and pushed to the side too, when her arc thins out it feels like it was a good idea made sour at the drop of a hat.Somewhere, in this movie, there is a joke. I guess. I hope. Much like A Million Ways to Die in the West and other films of that ilk, the only thing that made me laugh was a heavy reference to a much better film that had humour in the fact it took you completely out of the movie you were watching, because it's safer.Holmes and Watson is a hollow entry to round out the year of comedy movies. Alan Menken and Glenn Slater offer the second closest thing to a joke with an original song that's a parody of their work that's nothing compared to Vanelope's ""I want"" song parody in Ralph Breaks the Internet.Everything in this movie has been done better and bigger and funnier and smarter. Hell, even the overrated later episodes of BBC's Sherlock itself parodies itself better, even down to a drunk Sherlock scene that doesn't have to stoop so low as this movie does for an attempt of a laugh.It joins a bunch of movies I would give no stars to if I could, but the sheer fact that somehow this movie made it from conception to the silver screen is some sort of commendation. Plus it has a Titanic joke that makes no sense, but it makes more sense than the entirety of the film.And before you say something, yes, the majority of jokes in this film are indeed out of time. And out of this world.Which is not a good thing.1 Star.CJ",Holmes & Watson

It was shot moderately competently and ended up somewhat pretty albeit with some scenes that just completely dropped the ball.

183,andrew_jakobs,Worst crap ever,1,8 July 2019,"I hadn't expected much as it stars Will Ferrell, but this was really REALLY awful.
The script is bad, not funny at all.
It's a shame as it has a high production value, but the script is just horrificly bad.
It can't even be labeled a satire as the jokes just weren't funny (well maybe if you're drunk and stoned out of your head).
I wonder who approved the script, and that's just a big shame. Making a Holmes comedy would have been great if they writing and jokes were excellent, previous Holmes comedies have proven it, but the jokes don't reach a stage beyond the piss and sex jokes (and not even funny at that). Such a shame, because if it had a good script/story it would have been a great movie as the cast itself can't be blamed for it. John C. Reilly makes a great Watson, and Ferrell could have been if he didn't play as he always does (I think he had his hand in the script as it has the same kind of awful jokes he normally plays in).",Holmes & Watson

185,ashishagupta,unpolished omnibus of jokes,6,12 March 2019,"In a nutshell, this movie was everything for everybody.
It also had just about every British actor who has ever worked in Hollywood in various cameo appearances. The core of the humor in the movie was making fun of idiosyncrasies of Brits and Yankees.The problem with the ratings for this movie lie in its inability to please either of its two principal demographics.
(1) The smart audience will understand the pop-culture reference that is being parodied or mocked. However, once you realize the reference, the joke itself isn't particularly funny. The biggest component of a joke is the surprise. If the audience instantaneously knows where the joke is headed then it isn't really funny. For example, starting to compare unelected British Monarch and then mentioning American democratically elected president in the first sentence, already telegraphs the upcoming Trump joke.
(2) The average audience will not understand any references and the movie doesn't really have any other types of jokes. So this type of audience is definitely going to dislike the movie.Watching the movie as like sitting at a standup comedy show that you have seen before, a few times. I can imagine there might be some who would be in hysterics watching this movie. But that is like a sweet spot of people just about smart enough to get the references but not experienced enough to have heard all the jokes before.",Holmes & Watson
186,sansay,I wanted to leave after 15 minutes,1,29 December 2018,"I went to see this movie in a free preview, not knowing much about it other than it was a comedy based on Sherlock Holmes. A friend at work told me ""I looked at the preview, looks like lame humor"". I am usually weary of previews, they often misrepresent movies. So I went.
It didn't take long for me to realize what a big mistake that was. After 15 minutes of jokes that fall flat because too big to not fail, I decided I have to get out of here. But I was in the middle, dead center of the theater, and I really hate to disturb other spectators. So I stayed another 15 minutes, until I just couldn't take it anymore.
In retrospect, I think one of the problems with this movie is that it makes fun of a genius who is able to figure out what's going on by combining observation, knowledge and logic. It touches the very essence of what makes Sherlock Holmes so interesting and fascinating to most people. It tries to make Sherlock Holmes look like a fool. But everybody knows that Sherlock is anything but a fool.",Holmes & Watson

188,mhthehammer,Will Ferrell is done. Just done.,2,28 May 2020,"Holmes & Watson is another comedic take on the iconic mystery series by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. In this movie, Sherlock Holmes (Will Ferrell) and Dr. John Watson (John C. Reilly) are assigned to investigate the perpetrator of Queen Victoria's (Pam Ferris) future death on the Titanic. The murderer is their housekeeper Mrs. Hudson (Kelly Macdonald), who is a descendant of Dr. Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes), but don't expect me to analyze her plan because the movie doesn't care. Holmes & Watson is nothing but a barrage of predictable slapstick, insultingly deadly sexual jokes and painful meandering Victorian versions of modern-day references. Not to mention, there's an out-of-the-blue song sequence written by Alan Menken, who probably cashed his big paycheck for a pension fund and must have been ashamed penning such garbage. As for pop culture references, we get numerous allusions to Donald Trump's America, mentions of Fourth Wave feminism, and a cameo from Billy Zane at the end. Speaking of, the most insulting anachronism of all, aside from the drunken telegram sexting and the selfie from the Queen, the RMS Titanic was constructed in 1908 and launched in 1912, several years after Victoria's death. Not only that, the ship sailed not in London but in Southampton, tens of miles away. I know it's pointless to rag on a movie with nothing but comedic anachronism, but the Titanic ship is intentionally part of the storyline, one set in the nineteenth century where most Sherlock Holmes stories take place. Holmes & Watson is not only a downfall for Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly's careers, but also an insult to history, Arthur Conan Doyle's legacy and comedic intelligence.

I'm talking about Bob Hope and Bing Crosby, Abbot and Costello, and Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor. However, perhaps none have come to influence my childhood more than Will Ferrell and John C Reilly. The two are legends now with comedies like Step Brothers and Talladega Nights, and walking into the theater I was hoping the duo had performed their hat trick of excellence. For that optimism I was rewarded with the worst movie I'd seen in a theater all year!Holmes and Watson is a hollow corpse of a movie that lacks the charisma, charm, and raw energy of their other collaborations or even their solo ventures. Its got some jokes worth a Netflix veiwing but definitely not worth your money to see them.As a testament to the lack of quality in this film I heard way more snores than laughs coming from my 3:45 (15:45) showtime.

A few even laughed. There where a few good jokes.
But most where forced, badly delivered or just went on too long.
Thus could be good for a few laughs for a cheap couple of hours, but otherwise, it not that good.
The bigger shame is that there are some really good actors on this struggling to give a good performance, but hampered with bad directing and everything being on the leads. Constantly.

There is rarely any suspense. It is not nearly as creative as many detective movies or shows. Nothing stands out or is memorable.Overall: An unnecessary Sherlock movie that had no reason to be made. A simplistic movie that has nothing innovative or genuine. Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly play the same goofballs in their other movies, but the lack of story and not much to work with, turn this movie into a waste of good talent.

It is overall not as bad as depicted but 'just' painfully average. Anacronistic elements (the Titanic and Queen Victoria... really?) are odd choices and not exploited at all for comedy (it should be used in a clever way and not as other lazy / almost inert elements).

The next thing is it's a Will Ferrell and John C Reilley movie what are you people expecting this to be. I watched it without watching previews or listening to the negative garbage and I enjoyed it for what it was cause I had low expectation of it being factual in any way. I see all these people referencing other movies of Ferrell's and Step Brothers being one of them to that I say you cant compare every movie to one of the best the actors produced cause nothing will compare and it will ruin your viewing experience for the rest of their movies think about if you did that with any actor in any genre. This is like discounting the movie before you even begin watching it which means you won't enjoy it. Don't get me wrong its not the best newer comedy but it's far from the worst comedy to come out lately. Don't be a lemming make your own decisions forget reading reviews especially critics reviews as you can pretty much count on any negative criticisms foretold by the critics as probably a positive thing for the typical movie fan as those guys call the most boring dramadies and comedies hilarious. I see other people comparing it to older movies to them I say times have changed its not the 80-90's anymore get over it and all those comedians have pretty much dropped off the radar.

Unbelievable...The production value alone would save this movie from being a 1... and personally, I found the acting quite decent too (for a comedy), and the parodies of the Downey/Law's Sherlock funny (with a music score to match).Someone cried foul for the interspersed references to contemporary politics (and politicians), but that's no reason to dish out 1s; just plain and brainless hate obscuring reason and objectivity.

As for the Laurel and Hardy comparison--John C Reilly actually just got done playing Oliver Hardy in the wonderful biopic ""Stan And Ollie""--yet another brilliant performance!",Holmes & Watson

237,InCole,A funny comedy - if not very misunderstood by those who have seen it,7,6 October 2019,"This comedy seems to have gone over very poorly with its audience. But reading a lot of the reviews on this site it just seems like people have misunderstood the comedy or gone into the film expecting something else.It pokes fun at both the Arthur Doyle books as well as very heavily the Sherlock movies with Robert Downey Jr.It does so in a very effortless manner and nothing feels forced, the comedy interactions all seem to come very natural and the jokes come and go very smoothly and nothing feels like it is shoved in your face.It is hard to say why so many people did not like the film but with comedy this is normal I guess as comedy is perhaps the one film genre that has no universal taste. When it comes to drama or action movies it is far easier to make a film that everyone will love.With comedy you will never find a movie that literally everyone loves, some people prefer old Pink Panther movies, some prefer new ones. Some people love the movie ""Airplane!"" others hate it.My style of comedy is Airplane as well as the new Pink Panther movies with Steve Martin. I also love Monty Python films.If you go into this film with an open mind you can come out enjoying it and will have probably had some good laughs. At least if the style of comedy is what you like.This is not the best comedy film I've seen either but that is why I have given it a 7 as it is worth watching once - having some good laughs and then probably never watching it again.",Holmes & Watson

Wait, that joke about a women doctor early so much less than a male was absolutely hilarious, unless you've heard it over a thousand times, which you would if you had a wider experience with comedy than just US. The Ghost parody was hilarious, that is unless you saw it 2 decades ago in the vastly superior comedy Naked Gun. Is any more of this execrance worth commenting on? NO. It's a giant plop. If anyone thinks Ferell is at all funny should check out British comedy, and no, I'm not a Brit, I just like comedy-- S. Martin, M.

Personally I couldn't stop laughing.
It is a continuous series of absurdist comedy sketches.
Maybe you shouldn't expect a clear narrative from this film but just delight in its randomness.
From the Victorian version of boys out on the lash to Watson's inappropriate touching of Queen Victoria, I couldn't stop laughing. Maybe it's a cultural thing and you get it more if you are from a UK background familiar with early Python or Spike Milligan but overall it doesn't feel too different to Anchorman - just in costume.
Anyway, I loved it.",Holmes & Watson

And that is why this movie has failed in the box office and has so many bad reviews. This is why this movie will NOT get a sequel.Your ""liberal political jokes"" are not funny and therefore the movie just wasn't that funny. Not to mention these were all old jokes. These scenes have been done before. It was very unoriginal and frankly just quite sad.Etan Cohen needs to stick to what he does best.

260,Noah_Biondi,Doesn't take a detective to figure out how bad this movie is,1,8 January 2019,"Everybody everywhere has been saying that Holmes & Watson is literally one of the most abominable pieces of garbage in cinema. And do you know what? THEY WERE RIGHT! THIS MOVIE IS ABSOLUTE GARBAGE! YOU THINK I'M RAGING NOW? WHEN I LEFT THE FREAKING THEATER, I FELT LIKE BLOWING IT UP! THIS MOVIE IS HORRIBLE!What's the story? Detective Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson join forces to investigate a mysterious murder at Buckingham Palace. It seems like an open-and-shut case as all signs point to Professor James Moriarty, the criminal mastermind and longtime nemesis of the crime-solving duo. When new twists and clues begin to emerge, the world's greatest sleuth and his trusted assistant must now use their legendary wits and ingenious methods to catch the killer before the queen becomes the next victim.So what's so terrible about this movie? EVERYTHING!!!!!- well, the worst aspect of this movie has GOT to be the HUMOR. Now, if you're the person who likes silly and mentally insane faces as well as dated pop culture references, then this movie is for you. If you don't appreciate those kind of jokes in your SHERLOCK HOLMES movie, then you're normal. Despite taking place in 1800s London, the things that pass on for comedy in this film is (and I'm not joking either) TAKING SELFIES WITH THE QUEEN. Not only does it make no sense because photography back then was absolute garbage, but it's just not funny. When I saw the trailers for this film, I legitimately thought it was gonna be funny! But it WASN'T! And that made me MAD! Another thing that really sucked about this film was the acting. Despite Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly being a great comedy duo, they were EXTREMELY UNFUNNY in this film. Like I said earlier, there's a ton of annoying and obnoxious pop culture references that aren't even funny in the film, and the duo are responsible for bringing in 85% of this messy dump. And you'd think that although there's all these unfunny jokes that there'd at least be 1 or 2 that legitimately worked, but you're wrong! NOTHING IN THIS FILM WAS FUNNY! In fact, the funniest part of the film was the MPAA screen after the film! So the funniest part of the film wasn't even IN it! MY GOD!In conclusion, don't watch this movie. It's horrible in every way. Just don't watch this. There's much better movies that you can get tickets to, like Bumblebee and Aquaman. And apparently, this movie is so bad, even NETFLIX doesn't want it! THAT should be on the POSTER of this film! Don't waste your time and watch a good movie instead.",Holmes & Watson

There are quite a few sexual innuendos that is better left out, and the opening is not very strong, and there is comedic violence, but there are many, many moments when it allowed me to laugh at the silliness of Holmes and Watson. There is even a delightful musical interlude. And half the places you look, there is good humour. I enjoyed Elf, so I don't mind its silliness.
This film made me laugh quite a lot. I know humour is different for everyone, but I don't regret watching it at all.However, keep in mind that this film is a parody on Holmes and the characters are very, very different from that in the original story. However, in the end, i was able to accept the characters as they are.But definitely NOT a family film.

This piece of crap surpassed Eyes Wide Shut as the worst movie I've ever seen. How do I hate this movie, let me count the ways:1. The dig at Trump. Yes, we get it, Hollywood hates Trump. It's not shocking anymore, it's not edgy to make fun of him... it's just pathetic. We go to movies to escape from all the political nonsense and yet here it comes... and not even in an entertaining manner.2. The dig at rich white guys. Again, we get it... Hollywood, a town of rich white guys, hates rich white guys. Again, another pathetic attempt at social commentary which falls flat.3. The story absolutely sucked. It started out bad, and just got worse. I've taken more creative dumps than this movie. I kept waiting for something to happen and it never did.4. The acting was absolutely atrocious. Ironically, Ferrell and Reilly can actually act when they want to, but this movie was just garbage and gave them nothing to work with.5. The jokes were incredibly stupid. Not even funny stupid, just stupid. There were a couple of scenes that had a brief moment of humor, but it was shockingly brief.6. Shoehorning Billy Zane in at the end? What was the point of that?I literally left this movie angry. It was a complete waste of time and money, I stayed til the end hoping it would get better and it never did. It deserves every ounce of hate that it receives. And if you think this movie is funny, good or entertaining, I have to ask how much the studio is paying you for a good review, how you sleep at night and what is your actual idea of good entertainment.Avoid this movie like the plague.

Reilly that warmed you up to a laugh as Ferrell brought it home, but Ferrell fell flat everytime!There is a musical number, Ferrell is decent but if you can get past him, Reilly's voice is beautiful!Loved seeing Hugh Laurie, a shame he was under utilised... Laurie could teach them how to stay relevant! Or atleast boost the story and fun!Kelly McDonald and Ralph Fiennes, again, brilliant actors whose talents were completely wasted on this contrivance.I think this is my favourite Steve Coogan role, he was a joy to watch and used well.Pam Ferris and Rob Brydon were both a delight and I'd love to see them in the same parts again, in a straight version!Sadly Coogan, Ferris and Brydon are not enough to save this trainwreck!As for the ""American Ladies"" Rebecca Hall and Lauren Lapkus, they did an admirable job!

If you want to see real parody done with panache and skill, watch it. If you wasted money on this amateurish effort you'll probably cry for your loss if you watch real actors doing proper acting.I expect this has already hit the 99 cent table at Menards or Wal-Mart.

This movie doesn't take itself seriously and it actually shows how stupid the other Sherlock movies and series are. This is just very funny and entertaining. A bit like Dewey Cox and Tucker and Dale vs Evil.",Holmes & Watson
293,piekarskia,Terribly spectacular my dear Watson,9,27 April 2019,"If you sit down expecting some theatrical masterpiece, then I suppose you've never heard of Will Ferrell. But I think I've figured it out. People tend to hate what they don't understand. Therein lies the problem. This is perhaps the most nonsensical idiocracy since, well, Idiocracy. The masses just might be too stupid to realize and then comprehend the sheer stupidity of this movie. They even nailed the satirical representation of Robert Downey Jr.'s iteration of Holmes. I didn't last 10 minutes before I was BELLOWING with laughter. By 30 minutes, when I read most had left the theaters, my sides hurt and I was in tears. It's hard to fathom having such a lack of a sense of humor, but then again, I've met people. People suck, as does this movie. And that's the point. If you don't get it, you don't get it.",Holmes & Watson
294,raptorshark,opinion from a big Will Ferrell / John C Reilly fan,5,10 March 2019,"Ok so, I read through tons of reviews on here, many of which are overwhelmingly terribad. We rolled the dice on it, and I went in with super low expectations expecting it to be god awful. it wasn't as bad as I thought, but the humor is a lot dryer compared to other WF/JCR movies (I love step Brothers, tallega nights, walk hard, old school, anchorman #1, Zoolander #1). The humor in this is more satire (they make fun of the RDJ Sherlock Holmes movie either planned out scientific fighting lol. There's a few anti-Trump references (who cares), it's more like Almost Heroes humor if both characters were Matthew Perry in it. (I LOVE Almost Heroes, rip Chris Farley).
Anyway, personally I would not pay for it if you know what I mean (we rented it on demand for $12, I told my husband if it sucked he had to give me $10). It didn't suck, it wasn't great, but it was decently silly and it has a great musical number in it. And lots of nonsensical anacronisms like music that didn't exist yet in the late 1800s, and the Titanic setting sail from England. Part of the charm.TLDR: if you like Will Ferrell and John C Reilly you'll like it enough :) I wouldn't pay over $3.99 for it though if you're renting it. get a firestick & teatv app using a VPN.",Holmes & Watson

It is not a thriller, and therefore should not be reviewed as such. Although the movie is filmed in an earlier England environment, it contains references to today's politics and trending social network behavior in a satire way, and it shows how genius of Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly are in playing it out.I had fun watching this movie. The 3.7 rating is definitely unfair; there are movies on IMDB with better ratings that you cannot get through.

It was much better than anticipated. The sets, locations, wardrobe and nods to Holmesian London we're skilfully done and a pleasure to look at. It also has a good supporting cast. I had fully expected to cringe at the script and the humour but not so! It has been done in the style of classic silly British comedy with a few current references thrown in, incorporating convenient characters from the period along the way. I understand that comedy is personal but I don't understand the ridiculously poor reviews. I can only think that some of the subject matter is a little uncomfortable for some. But that's comedy. If you like anything Holmes related, comedy in a 'Carry On', 'Monty Python' or 'Young Frankenstein' vein, there's no reason why you shouldn't enjoy this.",Holmes & Watson

It's no Anchorman, that's for sure - it falls flat at times, especially when Kelly Macdonald's character is on screen. It just doesn't work. But the Reilly/Ferrell combo is still good value because they have such good comedy chemistry. I personally also really appreciated the lampooning of the Cumberbatch version, which I find overrated and naff. Plus, props for Steve Coogan's air quotes!

I lasted another 10 and I had to just turn it off. I'm so disappointed with the film because I really wanted to like/love it.

360,driftdog,Different!,5,23 November 2020,"Take your brain out, sit back and do not remotely think seriously or how it is so not Sherlock Holmes and doctor Watson. What it is, is a movie that is stupid, senseles and what! There are many real funny moments and it does sort of flow with a story. I have watched many movies and thought how I lost hours of my life but if you take it for what it is, it's ok.",Holmes & Watson
361,w359borg,Bad.,1,11 January 2021,"This film is bad. It so bad, ""bad"" doesn't do it justice. No amount of words before the word ""bad"" would be enough. This film is so bad, other bad films are embarrassed for it. Like, if a group of bad films were sat having a nice drink in a pub garden on a warm summer's evening, and this film showed up, the evening would be ruined within seconds, and Assignment Earth along with The Room would be so disappointed, they couldn't show their heads in public for a decade. Avoid this film at all costs, unless you enjoy the pain of bad movies or are simply quite mad.The bit with Billy Zane was funny though.",Holmes & Watson

363,mike-pugh1983,Great stupid fun,7,16 September 2019,They must have had a right laugh making this. I like all this stupid humour it's silly but fun. Kind of reminds me of bottom for any one who watched it. Not sure about all the hate. Maybe these people just don't get it. The godfather it isn't but it's a giggle for sure. If you like will and John c you will like this.,Holmes & Watson
364,talibmania,The Director must dye,1,29 December 2018,"Seriously why did this turn out so bad.
It has the perfect ingredients of 2 of the comedy geniuses of our time and my favourite detective of all time. How this turned out to be such an awful mess falls down to the poor writing and poor direction.
The writer and Director need to be layed down with their balls exposed just as a herd of wild buffalo stampede through the area.",Holmes & Watson
365,lolo300054,Its Will Ferrell and John C Riley,7,24 February 2019,"Its a spoof.
Why are people surprised? It is a movie based on well known characters, not characters created for the movie, yet it is their take on the characters. I enjoyed Will Ferrell in his English accent, you get to see a different side of him, of John C Riley too. It is a dramatic portrayal (if I may say) that is viewed as humorous, there's times when you know they are talking off script, just letting it flow naturally and that's the magic they have. The English references like the Titanic (with Bill Zane) was also enjoyable. The only critique I have is, why were the actresses noticeable younger than the lead actors?",Holmes & Watson
366,reinprn-29703,Masterpiece in many ways.,10,15 March 2019,"This movie is a parodie about Sherlock Holmes movies. And a damn good one.
If you are fan of John C Reilly and Will Ferell (like i am) and a fan of Doyle and Holmes and Watson stories (like me), then this is a movie just for you (me!). Every joke and scene is a full joy and those mockings about previous Sherlock movies is very well succeeded. I laughed and had fun. Btw ive seen many Sherlock movies and series, saw many Reilly and Ferell ones, always looking like, are they fading... and have seen previous comedies about Holmes, they were not very funny, was hopin when will someone do a good and funny one. But now they did this and they did it, its a jackpot for fans and for them (and to myself).
Only complaint i have is about the end. Why the end? When giving so much fun, who thinks about lets end this? This is not normal behaviour and someone should go to see a someone.
If you are new to real comedies what can make piss in your pants, dont be disturbed, piss in pants durng a good comedie movie is ok, really, nobody can smell it coz others have piss in pants too. And its ok if your stomache hurts later. If not, then wasnt a good one. Trust me i know what im talking about.",Holmes & Watson

371,blankenthoughts,An unfunny comedy ....,2,27 December 2018,"Even John C Reilly and Will Ferrell cannot produce more than a couple of mild laughs in an otherwise long movie.Comedy is the ultimate justice, it's either funny or not, and you instantly know. 90% of this film was not funny.The premise is solid, that Sherlock Holmes is a bumbling detective, and therefore causes far more problems than he solves. Unfortunately, the film's writers do not know how to write more than a couple of funny scenes thus voila!... an unfunny comedyAn unfunny comedy belongs in the same category as an unscary horror movie, a boring thriller and a non-musical musical. The elevator goes to the bottom for these kinds of movies.These two actors deserve far better material than this movie gave them to work with but then again, they did see the scripts before they took the parts ...",Holmes & Watson

375,antonyfoster,"One of those terrible, but watchable, films",6,2 May 2020,"Right from the off this film makes its approach pretty clear. It does get tiresome after about 20 minutes but it remains watchable and the wacky, random, stereotypical and rather telegraphed jokes do grate, but you feel you need to keep watching. Not a Farrell classic, but not a disaster. Kids will love it as there's little subtlety in anything this film gives you but there are some rather adult moments. It's a farce, and should be judged on that basis.",Holmes & Watson

It is not funny. It is not a comedy - it is a form of torture, which ought to be prohibited by the Geneva Convention. I would not wish this on the inmates of Guantanamo.Like all Will Ferrel movies - I am not a fan to say the least - the 'comedy' aspect is predicated on stupidity passing as comedy. It does not. Jokes are funny, being thick isn't.Some films are so bad they are funny. This is a degree worse than that. It is so bad, it is poison to the senses.Avoid at all costs.",Holmes & Watson

Nope, they were spot on. There were several times that I thought about walking out of the theatre while watching this. I actually took an extended 15 minute bathroom break just so I wouldn't have to sit in the theatre and cringe. I usually will give a film some sort of respect before I straight up walk out of the theatre and I did. But, god I wish I didn't with this one. My friend wanted to see this film and was genuinely curious about just how bad this film was. Please skip, skip, skip, skip.

I found this film hilarious, witty and well...just plain funny. Clever dialogue, slapstick scenes and some fantastic photography made this film extremely enjoyable for me. If a viewer wants gratuitous sex, mindless chase scenes banal dialogue and endless shoot-em up loops of a 3rd grade caliber then avoid this film.

I was genuinely staggered by the fact that such a floating turd of a film had somehow managed to hustle itself a cinematic release.Until December 27th, 2018 I was of the opinion that I would watch Jon C Reilly in absolutely anything, ""Holmes & Watson"" proved me wrong.Steve Coogan, Rob Brydon, Rebecca Hall, Pam Ferris, Ralph Feinnes, Hugh Laurie and Kelly Macdonald will all have to wake up every day for the rest of their lives, knowing that they had a hand on this film, the stink of which must cling to them like metaphorical sh#t to a blanket.Sir Arthur Conan Doyle received a writing credit for this film.

That's what gives it a spark of originality. The film is funny, even clever, and it has heart. Ferrell and Reilly are committed to their roles as the famous duo and clearly worked hard to develop the characters.I think this film will have a lot of staying power as a cult film, especially for teens.

416,abpod09,It's a satire. Grow up.,8,7 January 2019,"People don't seem to be tolerant of anything these days, especially of humor. This is the right laugh-out-loud, so-ridiculous-it's-gotta-be-on purpose, make-your-jaw-drop, damn near perfect antidote to the heavy, politically-laden, hysterical-about-anything society we live in these days.It's a humourous take at one of the most iconic fictional characters ever created, who has not only found a place in popular culture for the past 100 years but also weaved itself in popular slang. (Yeah, no s***, Sherlock.)I read a lot of 1-Star reviews with people whining and complaining that they left in the middle of the movie, or they thought it was absurd... Well, that's the point. This movie wasn't made to take Arthur Conan Doyle's legacy seriously. It doesn't even take itself seriously with an out-of-the-blue musical piece that pops out of nowhere. And I stress: that's the point.I've seen a couple of bombs with Will Ferrell that were hard to watch. This isn't one, by any means. ""Holmes & Watson"" miraculously manages to be a witty, at times beautifully-written piece of comedy with an amazing cast, as evident by the amazing John C. Reily (""Magnolia""), Rebecca Hall (""Transcendent"", ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"") and even Ralph Fiennes, who is brilliant as Lord Voldemort in the ""Harry Potter"" saga.And the reason I mention the audience when I bring up the reviews on this site is because a lot of it is American and a lot of the humor in this British-set comedy is geared towards Americans. And in 2019, America couldn't be more divided in this Trump-era. So I would imagine it's no surprise when a lot of Trump supporters watch this movie and have to listen to jokes about the kind of President they have in office right now: a politically incompetent showman who is also a tyrant and a buffoon. I imagine this deep dig doesn't go over well with a lot of the hardcore pro-Trump audience. Or maybe they don't like the red ""Make England Great Again"" fez which mocks the signature red Trump cap. I would go as far as as saying that what really strikes a nerve is Dr. Grace Hart's (Rebecca Hall) line about women receiving shock treatments to cure feminine hysteria. Ooh, that's gotta leave a mark with feminists. Not to mention the constant ""A female D-O-C-T-O-R?"" remarks by the lead characters. Yeah, I would imagine that stings... in a comedy movie.Or maybe is the reference to American's seemingly m God-given-right to own and use guns. ""They're Americans. Of course they would use a gun"", Sherlock says at one point.But that's what humor is. It makes light of important topics and flips them upside down so one can think about subjects and ideas and even firm beliefs in a different way. It's meant to create an escape from reality and this movie does dances with reality but ultimately is successful at being funny in its own way.Plus, just the crazy amount of thought that went into the lead characters' dialogue is something to behold and applaud. Of course the delivery is over the top. But the point is that Ferrell and Reilly do it SO well. To the point where I was left wanting more. Like, right now.So in a time where most people seemingly become hysterical with just about anything, I applaud the cast and director Etan Cohen for having the gumption to make a satire with a beautiful period production design and comedic timing that will not only make you laugh but ALSO provoke your thought at the same time.And with the British theme in mind, this European says: well done, chaps.",Holmes & Watson

I think I chuckled at one or two parts in the movie but that's it. The rest of the jokes and gags are aimed at not-so-sublte political nuances. Trump is a tyrannical dictator, destroying our country through racism and selfishness. Women are oppressed by white males, all races are oppressed by white males. Must be so hard for them to succeed. So boring. I'll give the first jokes a pass because they were funny, clever, and fit into the reference of the movie. But then they kept bringing it back with references from earlier comments during events that didn't fit into the movie. When people said the movie was so bad, they walked out of it, I thought for sure it wouldn't be. But actually, it is THAT BAD. Don't waste an hour and a half of your life.

421,cheriesuv,Not nearly as bad as people are saying,6,30 December 2018,"Yes, this movie isn't that great. But it's only an hour and a half, and there are a few laughs and some funny jokes.
I saw Howard the Duck in the 80's, and a movie called ""Coffee and Cigarettes"" in the early 2000's, and those are way way ahead of H&W in the ""worst movie ever made"" sweepstakes.
The worst thing about this movie is Will Farrell. He is so unbelievably unfunny that he pretty much ruins anything he's in. But if you ignore his lack of talent, you'll find the rest of the movie is rather funny. I laughed a number of times.",Holmes & Watson
422,malain-97635,Ah... Bad,3,1 January 2019,I thought it would have been a good slapstick comedy... But NO.. I won't even think about buying it in any format... the duet was the only good part...,Holmes & Watson

Once you do that the jokes will make more sense. I can see why a good amount of people didnt like it. Im already a Will Ferrel and John C. Reilly fan, which helped me give it a 7 and watch it twice before i brought it back to the red box.",Holmes & Watson

Poorly timed bathroom humor,it's s shame Ralph finnes tarnished his stellar movie career. Will Ferrell movies r either pretty good or really awful,I wouldn't say this is his Mona Lisa in the awful pile!",Holmes & Watson

426,chasedover-74530,It's silly and a fun time,7,2 January 2019,"I feel like the bad reviews are from people who wanted to either see this be step brothers 2 or another version of Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes. I liked it I expected not to but it was funny. Stupid? Yeah 100% but not in a bad way. It won't take you back in time on an epic Sherlock mystery adventure layered with dry wit, clever comebacks, and plot twists, but if you want to laugh and not think you are more intelligent than the movie go see it. Everyone in the theater I was in was dying laughing.",Holmes & Watson
427,thehoodiedgamer,First movie I have EVER walked out of,1,29 December 2018,"Absolutely ruined my day, There is nothing REMOTELY Funny about this awful film.

I, unfortunately, did catch this movie in the cinema and I had to coax myself into staying. Not even Seltzer and Friedberg would find this funny. It has even more shallow jokes than they use. This movie doesn't just have a slew of an unfunny use of anachronisms (Trump, Mark Twain, Titanic, etc.), but also outdated jokes using memes from ten years ago (duckface), overused and unfunny running gags (calculation in the head bits), and a wasted cast, even from Ferrell and Reilly.Those two deserve more for a big comeback as a duo. As bad as Sherlock Gnomes was, it at least knew more than a Wikipedia synopsis of its source material. I recommend literally anything else.",Holmes & Watson
429,docwebb-65066,It was a stinker,1,1 January 2019,"I'm a Will Ferrell fan but this was by far one of his worst films. I would not recommend it, even if it was on Netflix.",Holmes & Watson

Let me tell you something.If you're looking to see a funny movie that's going to make you laugh at some points then it's the right movie for you.

433,wheres_me_pint,Laughs a plenty,7,14 March 2019,I am stupified by the negative response to this film. The laughs were plenty and often and anyone who is a fan of O'Reilly and Ferrel's brand of comedy will get exactly what they are hoping for. I can not for the life of me imagine the harrowing trauma experienced in a previous life of anyone who rated this film down to a 3.4 average!,Holmes & Watson
434,rg1-3,How did the script even get off the ground.,1,16 March 2019,"I seldom write reviews and perhaps I should more often when I enjoy a movie but this film was mortifyingly embarrassing and puerile. I stuck with it for the first 10 minutes in denial of what I was seeing, after a further 5 minutes we walked out. I felt like I was coming out of a seedy porn movie house, I really didn't want anyone to see me. It really is that embarrassing.",Holmes & Watson

This movie would have been hilarious if it was condensed into a 3 minute sketch on SNL. As a full length feature movie, it's a complete flop. I couldn't wait for this travesty of cinema to end.",Holmes & Watson
439,dschuster-43709,Terrible movie,1,4 August 2019,"Most definitely one of, and quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. It is not hard to believe at all that theater goers walked out of this one",Holmes & Watson
440,sonsearle-78410,Terrible - can't believe it made it to the cinema,1,27 December 2018,Wow if I made this movie I would be embarrassed- I can't belive that it made it to the cinema. I love everything Ferrell he is a comedy genius. If it's a Ferrell movie I know I'm going to laugh for at least 1.5 hours but sadly not one laugh just shocked looks shared between my husband and I. I don't know what else to say if this was an annual student school play you'd feel sorry for your kids. Surely when they saw the daily takes they knew this one wasn't going to make it?,Holmes & Watson
441,baileyed-07336,Contender for the Rasberry Award,1,4 January 2019,"The movie was boring and filled with juvenile humor. l walked out before the movie was over. If you have seen the trailer, you have seen all you need to see. Stay home.",Holmes & Watson
442,larryham-74581,One of the worst movies ever made,1,28 December 2018,"I'm a huge Will Ferrell fan and have watched his previous works many times over, but he should be ashamed of himself for allowing this trash to be produced. It's worse than just bad acting, plot, directing, etc. It seems to be an attempt by writers to find a way to trash the president and the country and somehow make a movie about it.
The entire theater was silent with virtually no laughs produced at all. At one point I found myself almost falling asleep as I kept looking at my watch waiting for this wreckage of a film to end.
It's my sincere hope that everyone involved loses money so that such trash is never produced again. I paid $12.50 for a ticket and almost want to take the producers to small claims court to get it back, it was that bad!
Not only should you not go to theaters to see this, you should avoid it at all costs even when you can see it on netflix for free.",Holmes & Watson

I have watched Step Brothers five times and still find it funny. This movie was terrible and should not be watched even if someone offers to paying you to watch it. The movie theater for was completely quiet for this stinker of a film. I was amazed at how bad this movie was and I was embarrassed after convincing my girlfriend to take a chance on it. We left after 30 minutes and went bowling. This movie is not worth watching even after it goes to Netflix or HBO.,Holmes & Watson
445,LaBelle1979,Horrible,1,8 January 2019,"This has to be by far the worst movie that Will Farrell and John C. Reilly movie haveeither done. It ranks as bad and Kung Pao: Enter the Fist. It wasn't worth sitting through the first 20 minutes. If you want a movie to put you to sleep, or just flat out bore you beyond measure, than by all means, watch it. If not, save your time and money and do something else. This is a flat out insult to the Sherlock Holmes series of books, movies and shows.",Holmes & Watson

I couldn't take any more. The acting is so bad, I mean ridiculously bad. Two Americans putting on this fake English accent so badly, I assume for comedic effect, which failed drastically. The dialogue is pathetic and childish, and the the story poor. I'm surprised this even got a release. I expected more from Etan Cohen and the crew. This movie has no redeeming features at all. None! Utter garbage, and a waste of time money and effort. The biggest question is, why on Earth did they bother.",Holmes & Watson
452,holdensghost,Not *That* Bad,5,8 April 2019,"It's entertainment. It was (intentionally) silly, stupid and slapstick. Don't expect to be moved or to walk away with some new epiphany about humanity.",Holmes & Watson

Riley, another amazing talent, but I just couldn't even hate-watch Holmes and Watson.If it's possible to hate a setting or scenery for a movie, I did, and that should have been my first clue that this wasn't going to be a fun 1.5 hours for me. The location was drab and boring, the supporting characters weren't any better, and sadly, my two guys didn't even appear to be trying.There were about two gags I enjoyed, one when they shoot at the bees, and I can't even remember the second one, I just recall laughing twice. I have enjoyed a lot of stupid movies, but this wasn't even stupid, it was just dull.I have been waiting for this specific movie for a while, ever since it was rumored to be taking place with Sascha Baron Cohen. I even used my limited movie pass to see it when there are a lot of other movie options I'm waiting to see.The two stars have got to be for the two actors, just because I can't count them out, without partially blaming the writers and the director, but they are getting by on the skin of their teeth.",Holmes & Watson
456,jchivers74,It's the same level as Naked Gun!,9,31 December 2018,"I really enjoyed this movie, and honestly, I'm surprised people are ranking it so low. I'm not sure why, but it seems like goofy comedies don't do well anymore. If Austin Powers or The Naked Gun come out today, would they get trashed? Maybe they would have back then if we'd had the Internet (well, it was around for Austin Powers, but no so much social media). At any rate, I liked Holmes & Watson waaay more than Talledega Nights or Step Brothers. Maybe I just like the Sherlock subject matter more. Really, it's about the same level of comedy as The Naked Gun; silly jokes, a bit of poking fun at current ideas, and a reference to another famous movie (without being just a parody fest like some that have been compared to Naked Gun). But like Naked Gun, it still had a decent plot with a bumbling detective who figured it out in the end. I also loved the diagrammatic explanations seen from Sherlock's perspective, just like in BBC's Sherlock series. Anyway, if you enjoy any of the silly comedies from the 80s or 90s, don't pass this one off!",Holmes & Watson
457,dancing_neonate,I don't understand why everyone is so upset,7,30 December 2018,It really wasn't that bad of a movie. Everything was funny but it was family friendly. If people wanted stepbrothers they should've stayed home and watched that. It was PG-13 so people should've know what they were walking into,Holmes & Watson
458,avadubie,If only zero stars were available ...pure garbage,1,26 December 2018,"What a waste of money, time and Christmas Day tradition. Good thing we didn't buy popcorn, that would've made the whole experience even a bigger waste than it already was. Yes, we gave it a full 40 minutes in case it was a slow starter as some are, but NO. We were the first to walk out and I wish we'd have stayed outside the theatre door to count how many did! It started off stupid and just stupider. Not one funny moment. All we could figure is WF is convinced people will watch ANYTHING he makes and like it:(",Holmes & Watson

Reilly Worst Supporting Actor and this years Golden Raspberries, obviously didn't realise it was a spoof, in the same vein as Naked Gun and Airplane. From beginning to end I didn't stop laughing.

Shame on them",Holmes & Watson
470,mkdlfp,The Trailer Tells It All,1,24 March 2019,"Movie trailers are typically a culmination of the best parts of a movie which is meant to pull you in and get you to watch it. Often times the handful of good scenes that you see in the trailer end up being most of the good scenes in the movie itself with, in the case of a bad movie, everything else in between sucking. That being said, the trailer for Holmes & Watson is so bad that you can only conclude that the movie itself is so awful that they couldn't even come up with a few good clips that make the movie look like it's worth watching. So my review has been based on the trailer alone which makes me smarter than everyone else who got suckered into watching this pile of cow dung.",Holmes & Watson

I checked the movie times on the app as I figured a movie would kill time. I saw this was starting within 20 min so I grabbed my popcorn bucket and headed to the theater. Thirty minutes in and I opted to head back to the dark, quiet solitude of my home.It's just Will Ferrell and John C Reilly yelling because they're in a fish-out-water scenario.

It is a slapstick. It is funny and isnt a film that really follows a plot or asks you to pay attention to keep up. Its just fun. Nothing complex and nothing thought provoking.It isnt quite as enjoyable as Step Brothers but both pair up well as headline actors and has some corkers in it. Worth a watch for a light hearted and laugh and something to switch your mind off with. Not many films let you do that these days.",Holmes & Watson
477,bigjamezian,Not typical carefree Ferrel comedy,3,13 April 2019,"The Holmes character is closer to his arrogant, narcicist character of Talledega nights without the goofy, careless fun.

It maybe funny to real Sherlock Holmes fans who dont know Will ferrel movies, or college aged sheltered liberals who get permission from their professor and mother. Older Holmes fans; theres some sexual humor",Holmes & Watson
478,jenbpeace,I liked it! Made me laugh out loud a bunch of times.,7,14 July 2019,"I don't know what people were expecting. This movie totally makes fun of period pieces and of the whole Sherlock concept. I always thought the Sherlock Holmes character was totally over-the-top unrealistic and dumb, just like all other superhero-type characters. So, I love that this movie makes fun of Sherlock Holmes. People keep mentioning anachronisms, but that's not what most of them really are...the bits that people think are out of the time era are there to mock our modern day practices. I think this movie is simply over everyone's heads. The humor is quick sometimes and you might miss things easily.
It also mocks the whole ""sidekick"" concept. Why must so many superhero-type characters have a sidekick? It's so unfair to the sidekick. That always bugged me about Sherlock Holmes, too.
I also love how the movie mocks the era...instead of all the glorification that period pieces usually do.
I liked how it also mocks sexism, US-UK relations, British and American stereotypes, and US government/elections.
I enjoyed the acting and the characters and the humor. I can't figure out why so many people hated this movie. Maybe I went into it with such low expectations that I was surprised when I found myself grinning and laughing throughout the movie.",Holmes & Watson

It is not funny in the slightest and painfully predictable. I normally get frustrated reading 1 star IMBD reviews because in reality there are very few 1 star movies, but this one 100 percent is.

I was very pleased with the film. The humor was hit or miss in the first 15-20 minutes but after that you'll barley have time to breathe between jokes! Will Ferrell did an amazing job as Sherlock Holmes, as he brings a lot of ""stupid humor"" and keeps the character of Sherlock not stupid. John C. Reilly was amazing in the role of John Watson as he had the best character arc in the film. The villain of the movie was good being barely in the film (but making sense in the context of the film) and a very well done twist at climax of the film was not predictable at all! Overall don't listen to the reviews that take this wacky comedy seriously, this was an enjoyable, laughable film.",Holmes & Watson

For a movie with no intriguing plot line the film had to funny and spoiler alert- it was not in the slightest. The jokes were tasteless and even with Will Ferrel trying to breathe some life into the dumpster fire of a script, the movie flopped as a whole in my opinion. I recommend straying away from this movie.",Holmes & Watson
495,nikolataylor,Same best comedy duos,7,6 April 2019,"If you love movies that contain both Will Ferral and John C Reilly than this is a movie for you. They always compliment each other by bringing out their more childish and downright idiotic behavior! Not many actors can pull it off, and I believe they are the last remaining ""white males"" who have a free pass to act in such a way. Carefully trying to type the following sentence carefully on my cellphone when having a go on the potty; I in no means want to start a political debate. Keep in my mind this is my opinion and simply want to inform my fellow screen junkies why this movie is in fact good. Will Ferrale or ""Sherlock Holmes"" protrays this once known strong, handsome, smart character into a idiotic, feminine, and at times frail character. John C Reilley on the other hand stays a bit more true to the Character Watson, protraying the loyal, and slightly smarter doctor with the same hint of downright ""idiotic"" moments. So if you're hear to see another ""Step-bros"" or ""Talladega Nights"" movie well you're at the right place because that is exactly it... if you arn't such a fan, well my only opinion is try to watch it for what it is. A simple comedy of two guys acting like kids, kinda like the duo Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels in ""Dumb and Dummer"". Yeah exactly like dumb and dumber! It's silly and has primitive humour. With that in mind I can guarantee you a good laugh or two in the movies. PS if you can't stand a harmless joke, such as a sexiest remark once or twice in this movies well stay away. I'm sure the directors and actors would appreciate not having to deal with your uptight comments or ""tweets"". Im case you've forgotten this is a movie with Will Ferral and John C Reilley so what are you expecting anyways!",Holmes & Watson

I have been a regular cinema goer for 50 years and thought I'd seen some utter tripe but this heap of garbage really does take the biscuit. People were leaving in droves. The only so called comedy film I have ever seen where no - one in the auditorium laughed. Most of the audience were either asleep or walked out.

The latter is innocent and all the blame for foisting this execrable load of unfunny garbage on us must be laid squarely at the feet of said Mr. Cohen. I won't say that he should be hunted down and destroyed for being responsible for this travesty, as I am morally against capital punishment.
But if I wasn't, that is what I would say.
Oh, it is bad. 'Though honestly I can only say that about the first 20 minutes, as I walked out at that mark. I am sure, however that it got no better. Times must be hard in the film industry to have a cast of essentially competent actors, Reilly, Ferrell, and Lord help us Ralph Fiennes putting their names forward to appear in this humorless black hole.

There are a smattering of things that made us titter, but on balance the film is a real stinker. Jokes are stretched transparently thin, time and time and time again. The humour is stupid - which is fine, as long as it is novel and done with gusto - here it is just lame and laboured.",Holmes & Watson
506,VegasB18,Absolute Garbage,1,26 December 2018,Holmes & Watson is easily the worst movie of the year and quite possibly competes for worst movie of all time. It's unyeildingly bad. The jokes are often recycled and every single one falls flat. The story wanders almost aimlessly and the production value is bottom of the barrel. There is seriously nothing redeeming about this movie. Save your money. This is no Step Brothers. This is pure unadulterated trash.,Holmes & Watson
507,cjgenin,See something else,3,26 December 2018,"Nothing fell into place on this one. The jokes were bad, there was no thrill to the plot, and there was absolutely no need for another Sherlock Holmes adaptation. Being a crime-solving movie, you would think it would at least be clever.

Glad we ended up going to make our own minds up instead of listening to the other cretins, just jumping on the bandwagon.While this isn't a patch on Step Brothers or Anchorman it's not bad and worth a watch if you usually like this kind of film, even if it's just the one viewing.

If you listen carefully throughout the film you can hear Sir Arthur Conan Doyle roll in his grave.I honestly don't know where to start with this movie. The writing was terrible, the comedy was forced and had no effort put into it, both the leads were incompetent and cringe worthy and worst of all you had a cast of some of the best tv comics ever and you barley use them. I feel sorry for the DVDs that had this burnt into them.All and all avoid like the plaque",Holmes & Watson

Will Ferrell and John C Reilly are a modern day comic duo and I hope they make more films together. I really do not get the poor ratings and reviews on this one.

Yes there is some crudeness here and there but overall Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly give a really funny pseudo british performance :) The way the dialogues are acted out are funny - full stop!I also liked how the movie integrated many modern things and somehow made them Sherlocks invention or idea :DJust go watch it and dont be turned down by de 3.7 rating.

There is *no* way that it deserves to be eviscerated as it is by so many on here. It must be a mob think mentality or pro-Trump presidency crowd because there are a small number of anti-Trump jokes.Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly have excellent timing and really held the film together. Other reviewers on here have complained that the jokes were telegraphed as if that was a negative; I felt the fact that they were telegraphed made them all the funnier because we were in on the joke that these two were so clueless as to not realize what was going on. For example, when Holmes and Watson take turns slapping each other in the face to try to kill a mosquito. The timing is superb! With straight faces these guys slap away obvilious to the fact that they are becoming Moe and Larry Howard from the three stooges.OReilly's reaction to Holmes' ""disguise"" is uncommon in its sincerity. Watching Holmes create Watson's disguise is a hoot if you are not a stuffed shirt.Some of you maybe needed a cocktail to let down your walls. I predict this film will become a cult classic one day.It's definitely closer to a 10. than a 1. A 1? Nuts! Sad 1 Star reviewers missed out on the fun.",Holmes & Watson

I would not pay one cent to see this asinine ""so called movie""!!!",Holmes & Watson
571,martystu,Surprisingly well written.,8,14 June 2019,"This movie is getting a lot of heat due to it being a very effective parody of the Sherlock Holmes franchise. If it had done a lesser job at mocking the franchise the reviews would've been far more favourable, but alas it was not. The portrayal of Dr. Watson and Sherlock Holmes in this movie is straight up character assasination - which I'd like to remind you is a great compliment for a parody as it is suppossed to 'take the piss' out of what it mimics.I'd compare this movie to 'Life of Brian' which heavily ridiculed the life of Jesus to great effect and at the time recieved a lot of flak for doing so. If you are a devout Christian you are to this day very unlikely to enjoy 'Life of Brian' as it is not kind to the topic it mocks, and the same goes for 'Holmes & Watson'. Many of those who are fans of the new movies made out of Doyle's most famous protagonist will likely be outraged at the sharp - and often both crude and cruel - criticisms of their portrayal of Holmes and Watson. They pull no punches and not only mock the characters but also the time period and the country and traditions of England as well.As someone who does not get offended by anything but poor writing, and who is a big fan of the Holmes character - but can't stand the movie versions of him, particularly the contemporary ones - I enjoyed every bit of this movie. It was made for me, and people like me, who understands and likes the source material but who can't stand how it's been portrayed by Hollywood.I would definitely recommend this movie to other people, even though they most likely won't enjoy it - maybe even because they won't enjoy it. Perhaps then they can share in some the pain I've had to endure as I've watched countless of poorly written movies that other people seem to like.This movie is the opposite of that, it's a well written movie that people hate. And they hate it simply because of what it is trying to do - which it does successfully. All the criticisms of this movie that I've heared - except for one concerning the lips of one of the acresses not matching her words in one scene, which is a valid point - have concerned itself with critiquing the fundamental aim of the parody, to ridicule Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.It is as if they don't understand that a parody is not suppossed to play nice. This is not an homage, it's a takedown, and I loved every second of it.",Holmes & Watson

So we choose an alternative, Which turned out to be one of the biggest mistakes of my life. We purchased our snacks and beverages headed into the screen not knowing what monstrosity we were about to endure. We took our seats which unfortunately was in front of a bunch of people of questionable intelligence and attire. So the movie began From the beginning it was unsettling. The juvenile repetitive unfunny jokes were non stop. The cheap gags and outdated humour which i don't believe was ever amusing, Not to mentioning the terrible acting from Will Ferrell and his counter part. The group behind us seemed to be amused chuckling and repeatedly Stating ""it's so funny"" Thus proving my point on their intelligence. Then came a part of the movie which was in my personal opinion the worst part and consisted of will Ferrell Consuming an onion at this point the people behind me were in hysterics as though this was the funniest thing they had ever seen. My son was becoming very impatient I assured him it would be ok and it'd be over soon. we came out of the screen absolutely mesmerised and confused as to what we just watched, and how we felt about it.

Unfortunately, as much as I love my girlfriend, about 90% of what she watches is terrible. Suffice to say she gravitated towards wanting to see this particular movie on date night and I immediately started loathing it. And for good reasons.
Usually the pairing of Will and John results in ridiculousness of the comedic kind. This was opposite. It's as if they no longer know how to make good jokes (even if through improvisation) and have resulted to making juvenile scenarios or something that's so odd that it was likely hoping to come across as comedic but lands on unsettling or confusing.

There are so many clever references in this movie that it's hard to keep track of them; Like the elephant man in the waiting room. This movie is a blizzard of gags, anachronisms and laugh at itself episodes. The part where Holmes visualizes how to take out the giant wrestler is masterful; Reminiscent of the scene when Indiana Jones shot the scimitar wielding assassin and poking fun at Roberr Downey Jr.'s Sherlock.

I cannot say that any of the anachronisms worked comedically and to my mind they were an annoyance that added nothing to either the characterisations or the plot, for example, transposing The Titanic to the Victorian era was quite simply, totally pointless to any aspect of the movie and had no comedic value at all so, why do it?I expect this movie will feature strongly at the next annual Raspberry Awards and I would not be at all surprised if, in time, it becomes a cherished cult film in the manner of 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' and 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes'.",Holmes & Watson

623,PhelixRoth,"Incredibly lazy, as a comedy and a film in general",1,15 July 2019,"I honestly don't hate Reilly or Ferrell. I've seen both of them do fantastic jobs with decent scripts. This film...does not have one of those.Holmes and Watson could have been great - after all, the Sherlock Holmes character, being such a cultural icon, is ripe for parody. But this movie does NOTHING with its premise. In fact, most of the script could just have been copy-pasted from your standard brainless buddy comedy set in modern America, with barely any changes.For one thing, the film has barely any plot - instead, the titular characters simply stumble from one scene to the next, encountering various people of no real consequence (even Moriarty - played by the fantastic Ralph Finnes, a casting choice that would have been so much better in a serious adaptation - is barely in the movie and feels like an afterthought). And sure, not every comedy needs a strong plot; but when you're making a film about Sherlock Holmes, whose very character is built on strong murder mystery plots, you need to at least ATTEMPT to give your parody something of a story.And for another, the jokes are just painful. As mentioned, most of them barely relate to the Sherlock Holmes character at all - they're just standard slapstick jokes transplanted into a Victorian setting, with barely any changes; or else painful attempts at being ""topical"" that'll feel horrendously outdated in a few months. The film makes no real effort to satirise the Holmes character - in fact, it never makes us feel like we're watching Sherlock Holmes or John Watson on the screen at all. Instead, we just feel like we're watching Will Ferrell and John C Reilly faffing around in costumes and putting on dumb accents, and the film never tries to convince us otherwise.It's just low-effort tripe beginning to end. Modern comedy feels like a cesspit sometimes.",Holmes & Watson

628,mtbellsr,"I enjoyed it, try it for yourself if you like comedies",8,12 September 2019,"I'll preface this by saying I've probably seen upwards of 95% of comedies from the past 40-50 years, from old stuff like Caveman, the Kentucky Fried Movie, Under the Rainbow, and all the Police Academies, through more popular recent films like 22 Jump Street and Central Intelligence, all of which I liked. I'm not a film critic, I'm just a big fan of comedy.I waited a long time to watch Holmes and Watson because of how absolutely terrible the reviews here made it out to be, but I ended up enjoying it now that I've seen it. I won't say ""it's not as bad as people make it out to be"", because quite frankly I don't think it's bad at all. This is a decent comedy. The plot isn't Shutter Island but it kept me engrossed. It's more along the line of most Sandler films, the story is just a vehicle for the gags.A lot of the humor is subtle, in some cases referencing old stuff that a lot of young viewers just won't get. Have you seen Ghost, and do you know the song that plays during the clay molding scene? Well if not, an entire bit is going over your head. But if you do catch it you'll get a chuckle without any dialogue or physicality to provoke it. Likewise, some jokes require the viewer to pick up on facial or body reactions, sound, or even background material.There's a fair amount of politically incorrect and low brow humor which could put some people off. There are also a couple one liner modern day political digs that feel out of place and fall flat. Whoever made this film did not hire a what's cool in hollywood or at the BBC consultant. It's not a film for film critics either, that's for sure. It's also not as good as Step Brothers, which was a tough act to follow. I think these may be some reasons why it garnered so many one star reviews.I took the time to write this up so others who share my tastes might give this film a try for themselves rather than being put off by the scathing reviews. I gave it an 8. Not one of my all time favorites, but I'm glad I watched it. I'd say based on all the comedies I've seen, this would normally be sitting at a 5.5-5.9 rating  probably in the Joe Dirt sort of range, not the 3.8 it's got at the time I'm reviewing it.",Holmes & Watson

Wonder what that guy was thinking??? My God, some of the negative reviews are really hilarious! ""They were doing selfies in the 1800's"" (Hello, ""self photographs"" were not a thing in the 1800's - that's why it was funny!) We saw the movie on Christmas Day, in a totally packed theater, no one left, no one groaned, people laughed (probably not as much as my husband, who happens to be English - he roared throughout the entire movie!) Simple, slapstick, movie... I loved the little musical number (another thing people complained about) It was totally unexpected, random, caught me off guard, for sure, and I laughed out loud - and it was composed by Alan Menken (who is an Oscar winning composer for several Disney movies) Any review with ""I left after the first 10-15 minutes"" should be deleted, because their review is not valid, they didn't even SEE the film. Yes, there were political jokes - which were hilarious! *seems a lot of the offended are Trump supporters, so keep that in mind, I guess. It wasn't Shakespeare - wasn't supposed to be.

Full of bad innuendo, uneeded bad language. Especially because they had kids saying it. Too many unfunny references to recreational drugs that was supposed to make you laugh, but didn't.

638,georgegibsonj,A terrible film in disguise as a run of the mill guilty pleasure Will Ferrell Comedy,1,2 January 2019,"Recently there appears to be a trend of surprising films, surprising not in their content necessarily but in their ability to defy expectations, much wasn't expected of Bumblebee however it turned out to be a solid
enjoyable film, Spider-man into the spider-verse was met with scepticism due to its ambitious plot and peoples strongly held views on past spider-man cinematic efforts however it turned out to be a truly excellent film whereas with Holmes and Watson one could expect another run of the mill guilty pleasure if not great Will Ferrell comedy maybe heightened by the impressive skills of John C. Reilly instead it was one of the worse comedies nae films in recent memory failing to be funny or entertaining or even bearable for that matter.About here I would probably be expected to write a synopsis of the film I will do this but I am going to keep it brief as just recalling this films contents causes my blood to boil. Will Ferrell stars as Sherlock Holmes an incredibly gifted private inspector. He is accompanied by avid admirer and assistant of sorts Dr Watson played by John C. Reilly, Together they must catch the bad guy in order to prevent the death of the Queen.Holmes is one of my biggest problem in this Film more specifically the inconsistencies in his character. When it suits the plot he is a self and Watson assured moron who fails to see obvious clues and happenings however one moment later and he holds the abilities expected of classic Sherlock Holmes finding the most subtle of clues and saving the day not to mention he is incredibly unlikable but not in a love to hate way or comically flawed way more in a oh shut up and go die way.I could pinpoint many other flaws within this film but the vast majority of these are flaws for the same overriding reason that makes this film so poor. That not only does it rely almost solely on worn out comic tropes and ideas but it fails at executing them instead falling flat without fail every single time.This is a truly terrible film that I would not wish even upon my worst enemy, do not pay this film the respect of your time or your money. Trust me its really bad it will sadden you, it will dampen your belief in cinema and it will lessen the quality of your life in the same vain that it has lessened the quality of Planet Earth simply by existing within it.",Holmes & Watson

650,andeemartin-81685,What's actually happening with Hollywood comedies,6,31 December 2018,"It's been ten years since Will Farrell and John C Reilly starred in a movie together. Their previous two outtings not only done well at the box office but are now considered to be classic. This movie must have been something many comedy fans have been waiting for... but what went wrong? I don't think I've read such bad reviews for quite sometime. Luckily or some may say unluckily I went to see it before I read anything about the movie.
Honestly, I don't think the world needs another Sherlock Holmes spoof, it's been done to death almost as much as spoofing James Bond but I was in the mood for a comedy and this was really my only choice. Comedy at the cinema isn't as easy to come by nowadays I find, so seeing these two guys in a film together again I thought.... it can't be that bad.
My honest opinion is... well it isn't that bad. Moments made me laugh, I felt it was paced well and although not as good as their last two movies I felt their fans would get something from it.
I do however see why people are disappointed. Ferrell's portrait as Holmes, I can seeing being annoying to many, it's pretty crude for a 12 certificate (UK , guessing PG-13 in the US)..Mostly though I think is the advertising of the rest of the cast. Several actors names are on the posters, they appear in the trailer but are barely in it. Steve Coogan has a cameo at best. Fans of these actors will only come away disappointed. If they were unexpected,I think the audience would come away pleased with their appearances. Like when Bill Murray pops up in 'Zombieland' for example.
Overall it made me chuckle a fair bit, which is the point of a comedy and I can't think of many films that have done thst for me this year. Most of the comedies we get are animated (lately far more laughs in a pixar than in a live action movie) or the odd random film like 'tag' which although a better made film than this, I dont think I laughed more. I do miss the days of looking forward to the latest movies from my favourite comic actors like Steve Martin, John Candy, Chevy Chase and even Adam Sandler. I saw Will Farrell as one of the last of this breed. It would be a shame for this misfired movie to ruin his career. I think in years to come it will be seen as more favourable.
Also I couldn't help comparing it to the Peter Cook/Dudley Moore 'Hound of the baskervilles' another bomb with a great cast. Actually I say give that movie a go, you may realise this one isn't too bad after all.
Hollywood comedy seems in a slump at the moment, we either need to not have our expectations too high or possibly throw movies the way of new talent? Maybe both.
After this I'm not sure this pair will get the chance to make other film together. A shame.... who knows though they may need the money and the audience get the long awaited Stepbrothers 2. At least they tried something different I guess, remember the first 'Police Academy' was great but sequels aren't always the way forward.",Holmes & Watson

It is worth watching, reviewers are way too biased. I mean, you expect to see the comedy of the year? Will Ferrell plays his part very well. So does John C. Reilly. I have seen some of their previous movies and their acting is as good as before.

And I was pleasantly surprised. It reminded me of the hay day of slapstick satirical comedy. It felt right at home with other films of this nature, like The Pink Panther, Monty Python, and even some of Mel Brooks' films, albeit not quite as good as those.It never took itself too seriously and was very honest with the humor it wanted to get across. Satire and slapstick abound, the jokes were great and actually pretty clever and well paced.Will Ferrell did a great job portraying a satirically narcissistic Holmes and John C. Reilly did an amazing job at playing a ""never good enough"" Watson. All of the supporting characters were well cast and never felt out of place, or forced and added a great level of humor to supplement the titular characters.All in all, it's a satire by every definition of the word, and if you don't get that, or get offended by everything, stay away from it.

There were a couple funny parts, I will give them that, but overall this movie is nowhere near memorable compared to ""Step Brothers"" or ""Talladega Nights"".

Hit with the amazing duo Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, it was built up to be quite the masterpiece. However as shown by the horribly untrue reviews, they gave it a fate worse then death, a terrible rating of 3.4! I think the duo did a great job giving the serious and intriguing series that so many of us have fallen in love with. I thought it was constantly funny and Will Ferrell brought a very heartily feel to the otherwise dark and impressive detective that is Sherlock Holmes. I was laughing several times during this movie and I was able to watch the whole thing without walking out. I had not even one single thought of leaving this movie. It was totally worth the money and if they made a sequel I would have no problem paying the money to see this again. When it comes out on DVD, I will definitely get it again to watch.

684,Conundrum5,The Worst Christmas Gift,1,1 January 2019,"Holmes & Watson is a lazy and pathetic cash grab that insults the Sherlock Holmes brand to the point where I think Arthur Conan Doyle is rolling in his grave as I write this.This movie takes the genius character of Sherlock Holmes and the empathetic companion of Dr. Watson and turns them into bumbling buffoons so they can be 'funny'. Sherlock Holmes as a comedy doesn't really seem like a good idea, but this movie is the worst possible scenario.All the comedic bits can be 20 seconds to 3 minutes long, and they are just so repetitive, stupid and pandering. Like in the trailer, the leads try to take a selfie with the queen, and they do platypus lips and stuff, I don't want to remember. Thing is, the people making the movie are too lazy to actually get the camera to take a picture, so they just get Sherlock and Watson to whack the queen with it. After that, they think the queen is dead and it's just minute after minute of them being idiots. Nothing changes, there's nothing clever about it, no one in the theatre laughed at it. That scene was pretty much the entire movie in a few minutes. If you found it funny, I guess I'm happy for you. Me and everyone else who watched it with me in the theatre got little from it.There's the music as well, which is just annoying pop music that doesn't fit at all with the time period, characters and sometimes what the characters are doing. It's just there so the audience can recognise it. I don't know if it was meant to add to the comedy, because I think it detracts from the tiny slither of comedic value the movie might have.I'm glad that Will Ferrell is getting a lot of money from being in these awful 'comedies'. But, if movies like this keep being released then most people will be burnt out on this. I hope those who keep making these movies have some kind of change of heart, or just anything to get them to stop.This movie is horrible.",Holmes & Watson

689,chalz-81390,Unintentionally Incredible?,10,1 January 2019,"I'm going to be honest, I hated this movie. I read articles about people walking out of the theatre because it is so bad. I am a huge fan of Step Brothers and it is my favourite movie of all time. In my opinion, Step Brothers was made to be hated but people didn't take it seriously and they loved it.I'd like to think this was the same idea that went into the creation of this masterpiece. The main reason everyone is hating on it is because they took it too seriously. I went into the theatre with the mindset that this movie was going to be horrible and unfunny. I absolutely despised the first 30 minutes because I came in with that mindset.But then I thought, ""What if this movie was intentionally made to be horrible? In that case, it would be hilarious!"" And that suddenly changed my outlook on the entire film. I thought that the political jokes about the American government weren't made to be funny, but make the viewer very uncomfortable which I found hilarious.A movie like this isn't made to be liked, I mean they are spoofing a universally loved franchise and tarnishing its reputation. This incredible piece of cinema was made to make fun of the people who took it too seriously, just like how Step Brothers did.So go into this movie with the mindset that Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly are making fun of the people who give this movie a 1-Star review, and you will have an incredible time. If that wasn't their intention then yes, I'd probably give it a one star, but they've done this in the past with Step Brothers, and they likely did it again with Holmes and Watson.While it's not as unintentionally incredible as Step Brothers, it is a lot better than people say f you go in with the right mindset (don't laugh at the jokes, laugh at how bad the jokes actually are). <-- that was the intention for this film",Holmes & Watson
690,romancastillo,Cringe-worthy,1,5 January 2019,"It'll make you laugh sometimes, but it's mostly cringe-inducing. I went in hoping for something ALMOST as good as the classics provided by Will Ferrel and John C. Reily. It's nowhere close. Don't waste your money, stay away",Holmes & Watson

692,kyledouglassaint,"Yes, I did watch the whole movie.",1,11 March 2019,I watched the movie and was pretty disappointed within the first 10 minutes. Way to many political innuendos and the movies plot was to childish to even laugh at.,Holmes & Watson
693,themrdrop,Entertaining despite not being their best film.,6,14 March 2019,"Up front, if you go into this expecting it to be another Step Brothers or Talladega Nights you're going to be disappointed. I am a big Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly fan so despite the poor trailers I still needed to see it. If you are shying away from it because of the trailer I understand, but I truly think they put the worst jokes in the movie in the trailer.That said, the movie is not nearly as bad as everyone keeps saying. There are a few jokes that really hit home if you pay attention and a few that fall flat.Overall I think the entire cast does a good job with their roles and even though this isn't a traditional kind of Sherlock Holmes movie I enjoyed it. I would even watch a sequel if they made one.Despite my favorable review I do think overall it's a middle of the road kind of movie that is an entertaining watch the first time through...however, I don't see a reason to revisited it like I do their other movies.",Holmes & Watson
694,jackcampany,Just mind numbingly boring.,1,14 March 2019,Turned off after 25 minutes and I'm surprised I lasted that long. If you're looking for a step brothers type film... watch step brothers again.,Holmes & Watson
695,bon_eh,"A masterpiece of silly, fun humour!",10,20 March 2019,"You will not like this movie if you are:
1. a Trump supporter that gets butthurt over a small 2 minute throw-away joke.
2. A gun-toting American ""patriot"" who gets butthurt over some light-hearted jokes about America
3. A humourless (and might I say, obsolete) movie reviewer, who never gives comedies good reviews anyway (unless they are ""indie"" that is).
4. An obsessive fan of BBC's Sherlock who holds that version as sacred and sees anything having fun with the Holmes story as sacrilege.
5. Someone who just doesn't know how to have fun.You will like this film if you are:
1. Someone who knows how to have fun.
2. Someone who understands and enjoys this kind of light-hearted, silly humour.
3. Probably not American, and especially not a Trump supporter.
4. A fan of previous Ferrell movies like Step Brothers etc.

So much production & just fell flat. It was sooooo predictable that I just had it. Maybe if I was drinking.... Heavily then I would have enjoyed it. Maybe this movie is for 13 year Olds or younger I just don't know why I am even creating an account to say this movie just sucked.",Holmes & Watson

702,jpasse-88396,BS to any negative reviews,10,1 August 2019,"I don't see this as a spoof, the only resemblance to Guy Ritchie is the Holmes-o-vision, which is done hilariously. The rest of the movie is pure Ferrell/Reilly gold. My father wasn't a Will Farrell fan, so I guess if it just not your style of comedy why even bother, especially don't right a bad review of someones art. That's like saying a restaurant sucks because you hated the oysters, but what everyone reading your review doesn't know, is that you never liked oysters. That or you just don't have a sense of humor, which in that case, shove off",Holmes & Watson

I figured that a laugh or two would be enough to make it worth my time. It wasn't worth my time. I did not even smile for the first 40 minutes of the film and at that point decided it was time to leave. I can't imagine how anyone could have possibly have thought it was a good idea to okay spending money to make this movie. Just goes to show that the people making decisions in Hollywood may be the dumbest on the planet. The only movie I can remember that was nearly as bad as this one was ""Cyclone"". Although, I probably shouldn't insult ""Cyclone"" like that.",Holmes & Watson

705,gcrawfordd,Couldn't Watch more than 30 minutes,1,25 August 2019,"A real dearth of laughs I am afraid.
Started off with a good premise - the young Sherlock getting bullied and humiliated at school and deciding to devote his life to logic and truth. After that we see the grown up H&W and from then on the film shambles from one chaotic skit to another with no real point to the whole thing and a bunch of unrelated characters who might in the end get knitted into a narrative. We didn't have the patience to stick with it and switched it off and went to bed.",Holmes & Watson
706,msato-83158,Perfect comedy homage to the BBC Sherlock ever!,9,1 September 2019,"I doubted if this film is worth to watch because the critics reviewed this as worst, and it was never distributed in Japan at all.
However I was wrong.
It is hilarious!Very good historical background research.
Perfect props and clothings, and doing modern jokes using them.I admit there are too much nasty toilet humor which Kyle's mom never tolerate.
But it's only a small part of it.
You, especially those who love comedy, BBC Sherlock and Granada Television Sherlock Holmes, must watch this.
You will laugh, be amazed and love it.I do beg you to make it a try please, because they are presumed to be ready to make next part in the United States of America.
I'd like to watch it too.",Holmes & Watson
707,dondroid-39750,Possibly the worst film ever made.,1,9 September 2019,"I have just watched this and now I wish I had used the time to have a root canal without any pain relief. This has to be the worst film EVER made. The ""jokes"" were stale and telegraphed from miles away. The acting even by Will Ferrel standards, was diabolical, don't get me started on the accents, or the weird musical number. I genuinely mean WTF?!?.
Made in similar style and 'homage' to the Guy Ritchie Sherlock home movies it clunks from one scene to another with all the finesse of a bulldozer trying to make a house of cards. If I was Guy Ritchie, I'd sue the film makers for every penny. Some genuine talent appear in this movie (Hugh Laurie, Steve Coogan, Ralph 'Commander Waterford' Feinnes) and all I can say, it must of been one hell of a big payday for them, because they would never be associated with anything this awful otherwise.
If you watched this high, you'd struggle to enjoy one minute of this gosh awful, stinker of a fetid vomit stained movie. It makes the worst of the worst budget movie made by film students, with no budget, no talent and no skill, look like 'Citizen Kane'. Please, please do not watch this movie. If there is any justice in the world every copy of this would be burned and all memory of its creation scrubbed from exsistance.",Holmes & Watson

After being terribly excited to see their newest film, Ferrell and O'Reilly go further than just disappointing me on Xmas day. This movie craps on their legacy of fun, clever comedies. The editing is bad. The ADR was nauseating and distracting and confusing. The plot meanders and often full-stops. The jokes almost never landed well (I think the only thing I liked were the cat lady jokes). Cameos got me excited and again bored me to actual tears of embarrassment. I yelled, ""but why!"" Many many people left the theater but I made my friends stay because I had hope that I was being pranked by this movie. I kept asking myself, ""there's no WAY it is this bad, right?""

I have enjoyed every one of his movies (even Land of the Lost and Casa de mi Padre). But this movie was truly unfunny. I historically, as my wife and friends tell me, laugh at everything. However, I only laughed once during this entire movie, and I forced myself to do so. I really wanted to love this movie, as I have loved everything that Will Ferrell has put out. I even found ways to call Zoolander 2 enjoyable. But this was painfully unfunny. I can only think that Ferrell was somehow contractually obligated to make this picture. As excited as I was to see another Ferrell and Reilly ""masterpiece"" (Talladega and Step Brothers are both in my top 10), I really hope they find another script worthy of their talents and chemistry.

As I said this is the third and last film with Farrell in it at all that I'll waste money on. ""Talladega Nights"" beside not being funny just sucked. ""Bewitched"" he took a cute idea and his overacting ruined, I felt sorry for Nicole Kidman.

Went in having watched many of Ferrell and Reilly's past films knowing/believing most of them to be very funny. This wasn't even close to anything they have made in the past. It was written terribly, the story line had too many characters that weren't properly introduced, there was audio issues with words being spoken and mouths not moving, the accents were bad and weren't funny, and the movie had too much political bs in it.But my biggest issue was the political statements made in the movie. I don't care if you're Right/left/middle when it comes to politics...movies, especially comedy, is what people use to escape. An evening to just relax and have fun. This movie was used to poke fun with an agenda that some agree with and some don't agree with that had literally nothing to do with the plot or story line.

766,kevin-lillie,Nearly didn't watch this,8,14 April 2019,Due to some of the reviews I nearly missed this. Laugh out loud funny. Up there with the rest of Wiil Ferrels and John C Reilly's comedies.,Holmes & Watson
767,xjtdx,Holmes and what was that,4,2 January 2019,"After the last few Will Ferrel films I wasn't expecting much to begin with but I did go into the cinema expecting to see a bad film and how bad it really was.
The only good I could say was there are a few small laughs throughout the film but that's all you're getting if that. Secondly I enjoyed John C Reiley and probably made the film a little more watchable.
The small story it had seemed to be all over the place with no direction with some thrown in bad jokes about every two minutes and don't forget the pointless romance and love interest for sherlock to add a little spicy unfunniness.
Some good British actors signed up for this film and I hope the making of this film won't keep them up at night.Overall its not the worst film I've seen but its probably down there, if you want to see how bad this film is I'd say go but if you're generally looking for a comedy twist about a famous detective I would stay away.",Holmes & Watson
768,andri-hypogenic,Destroyed by critics,7,12 March 2019,"I loved the Scary Movoe 1, Idiocracy and this film. This movie is silly slapstick and if you like thet kind of thing - go for it. It never pretended to be something more mature or deep thought provoking. I should note that I have missed the last few movies of the main actors. Maybe, if I had seen them all, I would also be tired by the jokes. So, if you have already seen previous films with Ferell, then probably you will not like it. If, like me, you have not, then you might really enjot this one. It has many references and jokes that I liked. But I am a white male, so just disregard my review and move on :)",Holmes & Watson
769,FozzyRFC,"***DO*** believe the reviews, really really!",1,30 December 2018,"This is an absolute shocker of a movie. Not funny, bad acting, bad script, bad characters, messy direction and painfully outdated humour. Avoid at all costs, there is not one redeeming feature.",Holmes & Watson
770,joe31593,Why the bad reviews?,10,29 December 2018,I actually really liked the movie laughed non stop all the way up to 45 mins then it died down a little but I had a good laugh and so did the rest of the people in the theater soooooo I don't know why all the hate? Maybe because of the jokes about America? I don't know.,Holmes & Watson
771,scottmcwherter,Adam Sandler levels of bad,1,2 April 2019,"Comedy is subjective
Any art is subjective
Subjectively, this was intolerably lazy and unimaginative. You don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to predict exactly what's going to happen while each gag is coming at you... Slowly... Painfully... And hitting you with all the impact of a pillow being thrown by a quadruple amputee.

Wow how was this so bad!",Holmes & Watson
774,petersenkeith,Beyond Awful,1,2 April 2019,"If I could give it less than 1 star, I would. Quite possibly the very worst movie I have ever seen.

785,amblerb58,Awful,1,4 January 2019,"I just didn't find it funny at all. Look, im not going to qualify my opinion with crap about how long I've been watching movies or how highly you should regard my sense of humour above all others. I'm just an average guy who, like many of you just likes movies and enjoys a good comedy. Its why i went to see it. But, i didn't find it funny. Not one bit. I was bored throughout. I can honestly say it was the poorest effort of a comedy that i have had the misfortune to sit through. Its only my opinion though.One thing though, i have noticed more than one 10/10 reviewer admit that it wasn't worth a 10, but they felt compelled to balance the ratings. Please don't. Give it what you think it deserves and let it stand. If its as good as you think, it will become a cult classic, like so many underrated movies from before.",Holmes & Watson

All the haters really need to lighten up and learn how to have some fun! This movie rocks!",Holmes & Watson
789,irishcaliber-1,In the spirit of great comedy teams I counter your 1 star rating!,10,6 April 2019,"In the spirit of classic comedy teams this movie is brilliant in its own right. So many reviewers admitting that they only watched 5-10 minutes of the movie then being so arrogant and close minded to rank this movie with one star. Ludicrous, I say! This movie reminds me of a childhood classic with Don Knotts and Tim Conway, The Private Eye's. I think we could see more of these slapstick films from this comedy duo if they'd cut the budget down a bit, like quiet a bit. I'm pretty sure these guys can maintain the physical humor without all the C.G., just make these films to have fun and entertain us all the while still making a few bucks for the studio in the process. If you had ever had the pleasure of listening to the audio commentary by Tim Conway on the Private Eye's DVD you'd understand where these kinds of comedic duos are coming from. They really enjoy making these movies for their fans, and I for one like the way these two guys play comedy off each other. Well, I hope to see a Holmes and Watson 2; Coming to America, perhaps even running into Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall across the saloon. Ha Ha Ha, I know bad but that's why these two are making the big bucks and I'm just here reviewing the movie...lol.",Holmes & Watson

798,anitawarnes,Just a great comedy,10,9 January 2019,I really can't believe all the negative comments on here. This is a great comedy from Will Ferrell and John C Reilly. It is slapstick and silly but just what you expect from these two. It isn't supposed to be an accurate portrayal of Sherlock Holmes and I read one comment that read it isn't 'historically accurate'. No it isn't. It isn't meant to be. It's a COMEDY. I would say if you love slapstick and have enjoyed the other films from these guys then go and see it. I found it very funny and entertaining and that's all it's meant to be.,Holmes & Watson

The rest of the cinema seemed also to enjoy it. A lot of reviews do not seem to understand the typical Ferrell Reilly duo humour and similar to many of their movies, the plot is second to the laughter.There were many many funny moments, a classic Ferrell film. I will be quoting this for a long time to come. I went into the cinema not expecting a detective extravaganza as some clearly were. I knew it would be a laugh out loud flick and not a plot of any significant substance and it did not disappoint. Would definitely watch again!",Holmes & Watson

Even though i drank half a bottle of wine, 3 shots, and 1 beer, I didn't even smile at one point of the movie and I'm a person, that loves to laugh. This humour is either for little kids (it's a lot about pipi and kaka) or for those people, who drink way too much, that they blackout and don't mind the movie. But this movie made me think about my life and now I want to experience some more of (real)life instead of wasting my young years with cra(p) like this. Thank you.",Holmes & Watson
813,emielkendrick,Trash,1,19 April 2019,"Might be the worst movie I've ever seen. It's not funny. They try to play off their relationship and it doesn't work.

It's not groundbreaking by any means, but it still had me chuckling a decent amount of times. I was entertained by it. I didn't go in there expecting an oscar though, so maybe that's the problem?
I hope the ratings aren't due to the clear political jab of the current dude in office. I could just be being paranoid, but we live in marvaleous times. Who knows!Bottomline: it's not as good as Stepbrothers or Talladega Nights, but you'll laugh if you dig WF and JCR. If you're worried, wait until it hits Redbox.",Holmes & Watson
823,kumkewx,I Honestly couldn't believe how bad the movie was,1,5 January 2019,"Alright. So I loved Will Ferrell and John C Reiley in a bunch of previous movies (Dewey cox story, Talledega nights, Stepbrothers, Anchorman). So when I saw both of them in the same movie, I was expecting a very good comedy with lots of random situations and hysterical laughter. Unfortunately this was not the case.The movie was very slow paced. This movie could have been easily done in 65-70 minute run time however they decide to throw in filler for 80% of the film.The trump jokes, while somewhat funny, we're kinda lacking any connection with the story at hand. What does Sherlock Holmes have to do with 2018 pop culture and politics?The fight scene in the movie with the Perrenal WWF Jobber Braun Strowman, looked about as out of place as Arnold fighting the Big Show in ""Jingle All the Way"". More Robert Downing Jr Ripoff during this scene with the math equation ""that didn't work"".The one doctor being a cat had no place in the storyline. What was her purpose other than standing there? Why cast that role in the first place?There was only 6 people in attendance for the film. 3 people walked out leaving me and my friend Joe and some random woman towards the front. I then started to pull out my dab pen to try and stay focused on the film. The final scene with Morarity dying the way he does and Sherlock saving his friend Watson that he had betrayed and accused him of killing everyone was very lackluster. A musical number made no sense hereOne F bomb the entire film. Clearly a phoned in performance by both men. Will Ferrell might be on the down slope ala Jim and Adam.",Holmes & Watson
824,jenna-68022,Terrible,2,3 January 2019,"I usually love will ferrel movies especially paired with John C. Reilly but this was just the worst movie I have ever paid to see.

I walked into this knowing it was at a 6 on Rotten Tomatoes, but used my AMC pass to go to a late screening anyway when my wife and kids were in bed and I was biding time before covering a co-worker's graveyard shift. The trailer convinced me that there would be at least a few laughs, and maybe the critics were dogpiling unfairly. But ye Gods, this movie is terrible. I did laugh 2-3 times early on, although I was still trying to be optimistic, and I'm not totally sure they were truly earned. Having Ralph Fiennes as Moriarty sounded like a stroke of genius, but he has maybe 3-4 minutes of total screen time.Anyhoo, if anyone reading this is tempted to go just out of curiosity whether it can really be that bad, it is. For me, no harm was done because I had paid for the pass, got to sit in a comfy recliner, and had no other interesting options other than trying to get a little more sleep or seeing the also-reviled Welcome to Marwen. Under no circumstances should anyone actually pay to see this.",Holmes & Watson

842,capeboardrider,A fun film for Sherlock Holmes fans,6,19 April 2019,"This movie is a very well done parody of the Sherlock Holmes stories. I hadn't read any since I was in school, I'm retired now and took the time to binge read the whole series this winter. I believe you have to be very familiar with the Sherlock Holmes stories to fully appreciate all of the humor in this movie and to understand who the various characters are.",Holmes & Watson

846,kennykelme,Painful,2,26 December 2018,"I can honestly say that this was the most disappointed I have been in a movie in a long time. I kept hoping it would get better, but it continued to disappoint til the very end. The silence in the theater was odd, I would have expected a rip roaring giggle fest, it NEVER happened. I honestly think people were a bit in shock at just how bad it was. I thought about walking out half way through it, but my family was in tow.
Save you money and wait til it comes out on Netflix, then you can turn it off 1/3rd of the way through it as it was truly painful to watch....Trust these reviews, it is HORRIBLE...",Holmes & Watson
847,markdebbiemaloney,Waste of your time/money,1,26 December 2018,Unspeakably unfunny. People were sleeping in seats near me. Shameful money grab for the Holiday Season. Won't even be worth watching when it hits Netflix in February.,Holmes & Watson
848,acaddison,"Predictable and not funny, just awful.",1,2 January 2019,A truly awful film. The film we wanted was sold out but decided a Will Ferrell film is normally good for a laugh. How wrong we were. All their usual attempts at humour but none really landed and it seemed a bit confused about what way it wanted to be funny. Great supporting cast but wasted on a really poor movie.Only reason I didn't leave during was because my husband fell asleep and it seemed a shame to wake him.,Holmes & Watson
849,edwebb-10816,SHOCKING,1,18 March 2019,"Being a fan of the detective, I was definitely up for this, pretty good cast, but how wrong was I, main characters were complete fools,portraying the legends as imbeciles, 20 minutes into the film,got very bored and moved, never been so disappointed in a film..",Holmes & Watson
850,maxforddollars,Extremely funny,7,28 December 2018,"My family and I, who detest those mainstream comedies such as The Big Bang Theory, Friends, Brooklyn Nine Nine etc. due to their reliance on one liners and lack of genuine comedy, were in stitches at this movie. You may see other reviewers on here denouncing the movie as mindless, plotless and crude, and they're actually not too far off the mark. As far as plot and moviemaking goes, this is no masterpiece. The real appeal of this movie is the hysterical comedy. There are some fantastic political references, some hilarious set pieces, and in general just great comedic moments. The reason most people detest this movie in my opinion is because they were expecting a Robert Downey Jr-esque take on Sherlock Holmes, in that the movie is serious, well-plotted and articulate. Well, what I say to these people is, you've literally got dozens of Sherlock Holmes films to watch for these qualities. What the director of this movie has done is thought outside the box a little, taken a vastly different take on Sherlock Holmes than the endless amount of filmmakers before this. This is a rollicking comedic ride, with the lack of plot more than compensated for by the consistent laughs that you get of it. People don't laugh enough anymore, and it is for this that this film is well worth the watch.",Holmes & Watson

862,dyllack,Disregard the other reviews...This movie is great!,8,18 March 2019,Movie was actually pretty good. I enjoyed every second of it. Acting was good. Everything was great in my opinion. However I think they may have got higher ratings if they didn't label it as a comedy. I did find it funny here and there but I more believe it was a crime thriller with a hint of comedic skits.

866,sherekarn,Don't waste your money,1,26 December 2018,Thought would be a good family film to go to on Boxing Day. Big mistake. How it's been rated a 12A is beyond us.

Ok the Scottish Mrs Hudson doesn't draw many laughs, but Holmes and Watson are brilliant throughout.

I am a huge fan of Will Ferrel and I have seen almost all of his movie but this was not I was expecting. I have so many questions to why did this movie even shown in the Cinema much more opened up on Christmas Day! I hope Will Ferrel and John C.

The movie should really be banned for broadcasting as it is dangerous for the mental health of the people. I am serious. Shame for the actors participating in that piece of garbage that do not deserve to be called a movie. I am ashamed that I had tortured myself so much and I did not leave the cinema hall after the very first minute of that all time nonsense. And yes, zero is not enough low grade for that.

This movie was very dry, the story as well as the humor. For those who complained about this, either have never read or watched anything related to Sherlock Holmes or have never seen a movie with the main two actors. Clearly they didn't know what they were walking into, but this movie was great if you have seen Walk Hard or SNL and expected something along those lines.",Holmes & Watson

879,QJCom,Not That Bad!,5,6 January 2019,"This movie is really not as bad as everyone is saying. The humor is exactly what you'd expect from a Will Ferrell comedy.

883,will_murtagh,How is a film with this cast so bad?,1,30 December 2018,"This film is so bad it gives me energy.I now feel compelled to warn people who, like us, may be tempted to part with actual cash to watch a Will Ferrell film, purely because it's got Will Ferrell in it... It must be at least 'OK' right? Surely he, and the likes of Coogan and Fiennes wouldn't sign off on this?
I can only presume to think this is some sort of social experiment in which everyone is in on it apart from me and my secretly-filmed reactions are all going to end up on Jimmy Fallon...
The supposedly untouchable Ferrell spends most of the film wrestling with the English accent at the expense of any glimpse of humour.
Old English satire is unforgivingly beyond him, even if the writing had afforded him any chance of making a funny. He simply resorts to the odd Ferrell-esque shriek which comes off as just desperate. It's a painfully damaging blotch to the Ferrell brand.
As for Coogan, Lawrie and Fiennes - they all feature very little (and presumably since have collected their pay checks, run for the hills and will claim they were never involved - I would).Seriously, who wrote this? It's career ending stuff all round. It will win all sorts of 'worst film' awards no doubt.
Ferrell, what are you doing?!
Embarrassing mate.",Holmes & Watson

920,skylersimpson-70795,Not step brothers or talladega but still pretty funny...not sure why everybody hated it.,7,26 December 2018,I saw this movie with my family on Christmas and none of us left the theater disappointed. We weren't blown away or anything. There wasn't a plot that left us in awe or anything like that but I wasn't really expecting one. For all the people who left 1 star reviews calling it the worst movie they've ever seen...not really sure what kind of expectations they were walking into this movie with. I was expecting a Sherlock Holmes spoof that made me laugh and it delivered on those expectations.,Holmes & Watson
921,torbrowsingthomas,A film for the ages,10,28 December 2018,Will Ferrell is a beautiful and amazing transgender actor who does not deserve the hate she is currently recieving. We are living in 2018 and it is time for Christianity to finally hault on all its hate. Yes I understand a lot of you are less progressive than myself but in the future is it my kind which will be known for creating the positive future of tomorrow. Not you people. And in that future the entire works of Will Ferrell will be our Bible and great leaders will carry around USB sticks with our beautiful transgender God to signify his importance.,Holmes & Watson
922,ciaran-98907,Utter Garbage!,1,26 December 2018,"Can think of few worse films than this. It was a waste of time and money, so much so, we decided to leave after 1 hour to at least save some of that time - a first!The reunification of the Step Brothers duo made this film initially an attractive choice but, sadly, that wasn't to materialise. An embarrassing addition to the Sherlock Holmes name, poor attempts at humour raised few forced laughs following a most thin plot line.Don't waste your time and money, there are many better alternatives out there.",Holmes & Watson
923,aronhowell,Clearly a money-grab,2,26 December 2018,"I rated this 2 stars for the number of times I laughed. I knew that this was not going to be a Talladega Nights or Step Brothers but I expected some fresh, easy-going, down-to-earth humor. Instead you get stale plot and thoughtless politically driven jokes. I want to watch sports, movies, TV, or anything that stays away from politics. Whether you're left, right, or just don't care; watching something that steps away from politics would be refreshing and this movie sinks to the level of not so subtle jabs at political topics. Ferrel is a great comedian but this was just an attempt to put him back on our radars by appealing to trending ""hot button"" areas.",Holmes & Watson

It would have done so much better with the writer of taledega nights, and step brothers. (side note: inappropriate to a high extent, and was only funny half the time aka bad payoff)",Holmes & Watson
927,dickymail,"It's comedy, I laughed, so it did what it says on the tin.",7,30 December 2018,"Welllll, after reading all these incredibly negative reviews you'd think it was the worst film ever.
Actually it's not, it seems that no one on here seems to get the humour at all.
Or is it because I'm British?
It was never going to be a work of art, or an Oscar contender. It's the re-pairing of comedy duo Ferrell and Reilly. You know what you're going to get.
It's an out and out comedy, nothing more, nothing less.
I laughed at quite a lot of it, some of the humour was standard, some silly, some of it hilariously subtle.
Don't write this off, go see it, it's nowhere near as bad as all these reviews. 😁",Holmes & Watson
928,abeeby-64240,HILARIOUS,9,5 May 2019,"I haven't laughed so hard in a long time these guys are brilliant together. There are so many funny little parts in it...

If you like this comedy duo do yourself a favor and don't watch this; if you do you will regret it immensely. Don't pay attention to the reviews saying it was good or anything like Talladega Nights, this movie was utter garbage and all of us who watched it were duped into wasting good money and our time sitting through this terrible, terrible movie!",Holmes & Watson

933,boominator,Terrible movie,1,28 December 2018,Probably the worst movie I have watched in a long time. There is nothing good about this apart from Will and John being together again.

Naysayers, you've been punk'd ! The jokes are well hidden between carefully crafted scenes and conversations, Etan Cohen excels in smuggling the humor in front of you, and John C. Reilly clearly gets the direction.Like the stand up comedian, who botches well-known and overused cliché punch lines on purpose, I dare to say this piece of comedic art will represent a new chapter in the history of court jesters.Thanks to all contributing to this new era of ingenious entertainment! It has been a privilege to become part of modern art history.",Holmes & Watson
935,adobbins-09734,Nope,1,29 December 2018,I like goofy movies with childish comedy. I only wish this movie could've met that ridiculously low bar. I fell asleep halfway through and nearly got up and left when they broke out into song. I like all the actors in this movie but the sum of all parts was atrocious. I wish movies had a money back guarantee....,Holmes & Watson
936,andrewpetrouap,Great comedy,10,29 December 2018,"A really funny comedy with great laughs every few minutes.
One of Will Ferrell's best comedies.
Well acted, great sets and non stop gags that work. Even the music was great.
Only someone who has lost their sense of humour could not enjoy this.",Holmes & Watson

939,isabeltran,One big fart joke,1,29 December 2018,"The humor in this movie is slapstick only, apart from a couple political jokes. The slapstick consisted of puking, dryhumping the queen, and eating cake with a corpse in it. Don't watch this even for free! It is time you will never get back.",Holmes & Watson
940,theresebratberg,Hilarious,10,30 December 2018,This movie is hilarious. It is meant to be a little stupid at times but tons of laughs and a twist at the end. Loved it!,Holmes & Watson
941,mchrisxbo,Absolutely hilarious!,10,30 December 2018,"I can't believe some purists here are completely lacking a good sense of humor. Please don't project your serious outlook on others. Below 5 rating is a pathetic taste for this type of funny movie.10 out of 10!This movie is funny, witty and Ferrell is very talented I must say. Loved it!! There were times that I was bursting in laughter in the theater; a bunch of times.You wouldn't want to miss out on a very funny classic movie, would you?",Holmes & Watson
942,beauchatg,Bad.,2,30 December 2018,"There was a group that left halfway through the movie. They made unoriginal barf jokes. The writing was atrocious. Normally, even comedies have serious moments that advance the plot, but this movie lacked that.",Holmes & Watson

I do not get why there are so many people hating on this movie. This movie was amazing. It featured the classic comedy duo of Will Ferrell, and John Riley, and was hysterically funny. I will admit some of the jokes there were corny, or broke the 4th wall, but i personally find that funny. Even then the movie in and of its self was great. I guess it's no great Gatsby, but instead a comedy based on the original work of Sherlock Holmes. Honestly I think this was one of the better movies i have ever watched.",Holmes & Watson
947,benpaule,This is NOT Even Laughably Bad,1,31 December 2018,"My girlfriend and I went to see this movie despite the reviews. We love stupid Will Ferrell comedies and figured that other reviewers just didn't ""get it."" We were wrong. Right from the start, this movie is uninspired, boring, graphic, and inconceivable. What sucks the most is that the set is great, the costumes are good, the music is actually incredible, but the writers and the actors were all apparently horribly ill while writing this, because it is nothing but an absolutely horrible fever dream from start to... I'd say to finish, but my girlfriend and I walked out as soon as we hit the ""morgue scene.""Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly were so funny in Step Brothers, because they played stupid versions of themselves. Here, Will Ferrell uses a downright offensive British accent, and the directors apparently thought that this would be humorous in itself? This is the only explanation for why anyone thought this movie was funny, because the ""jokes"" are certainly not funny.It's like a bad SNL skit that went on for an hour and 30 minutes too long, because there is one joke the whole time, and it never lands; Holmes and Watson are stupid. This doesn't even remotely make sense, let alone make me laugh. I chuckled once. Ok, twice. But I got nothing more than a ""heh"" out. Otherwise, this is not even a film to be laughed at. As soon as Will Ferrell came on screen, I leaned over to my girlfriend and said ""Oh my God... is this going to happen the whole movie?"" I didn't finish it, but I'm pretty sure it did happen the whole movie. That's what I saw.How many more times do I need to say it? I LOVE stupid Will Ferrell comedies! I love Step Brothers, Blades of Glory, Talladega Nights, etc., But this movie is uninspired and IN NO WAY IS IT FUNNY. Save your money. Or if you want to put your cash to better use, rip it into pieces, turn on your fireplace, and incinerate it.",Holmes & Watson
948,lmlecorgne,Straight Rubbish,1,31 December 2018,"As a huge fan of Step Brothers and Talladega Nights, I had mediocre hopes for this one. Decided to see it for our traditional Christmas movie outing. Let's just say, this movie was a bigger Christmas let down than the Christmas when I was 14 and my mom's boyfriend tried to fight my older brother. At least back then I got to ride in a cop car and go to a new home. Oh, and my brother totally won the fight. Don't waste your money.",Holmes & Watson

954,Mihai1983,Funny comedy,9,4 January 2019,"I would begin this review by saying that everything is relative, let's think of abstract art, for example, at first glance you would be temped to say it was painted by a 5 year old child, but because it received the appreciation of some art critics, people have seen this current in a positive light, I think the same thing happened here, people read the negative reviews and the subconscious rated the film as a bad one from start.
I personally amused and laughed a lot, is not this the purpose of a comedy ?! If you have a cinematic culture, you're already familiar with the Will Ferrell style and you know the expectations, if you are alergic to peanuts don't eat them.

Prior to going to see Holmes and Watson, my husband checked the reviews, and found most of them declaring ""thumbs down"", but, hey, EVERYONE I knew LOVED the Titanic movie when it came out, but by the time the main guy in Titanic was going under for the umpteenth time I was ready to push him down myself, so I chose not to judge the Holmes & Watson movie through comments... as I'm sure 'you' are wise enough to do. So, we went, and we laughed, and we got the jokes, and we got the sarcasm, we even got the ""TRUMPed"" remark, and we laughed again. The easily offended may walk away with their noses in the air, but we got the humour, and we laughed again! Needless to say, we're still Ferrell, Reilly, Holmes and Watson fans!I must say, Ralph Fiennes plays his part so well! The accent he uses stunned me; I never expected that accent to come out of his mouth. I loved it! :D Well done, Mr Fiennes!And Kelly Macdonald!! Good call for Mrs Hudson. It was weird hearing her real accent, lol, but she was great, too!Hugh Laurie, Pam Ferris, Rob Brydon, and Steve Coogan...

A corpse people. I don't care what your beliefs are, this is absolutely disturbing and I am disgusted and will never EVER. Be trying annother film like this ever again. Sickening.

Reilly as a brilliant actor and always like his characters. Moreover, I love this Sherlock Holmes stuff and cheap humour, so I decided to go and watch the movie. And you know, I liked it very much. In my opinion, first of all, it is very beautiful by its picture and costumes, secondly, there were no certain naked body parts and downright insults. On the contrary, there were a lot of silly and primitive jokes which I laughed at tears. Yes, there were two moments for me that may seem a little too much but still okay. I loved the interaction between the characters of Holmes and Watson and the actors' play as well. This movie is sure not the worst movie as it is said. I really enjoyed the beautiful picture, good actors' play and simple gags - I cannot ask for more. With my review I would encourage you not to be afraid of watching smth only because it gets negative evaluation.",Holmes & Watson
