0,MartinHafer,"While it seems like a super-offensive film, it actually is incredible social, political and media commentary.",9,23 May 2016,"Imagine a film made guerilla-style like ""Borat""....but with a guy dressed up like Hitler walking about modern day Germany! Well, you don't really need to imagine too much as some crazy filmmakers have done that with the film ""Look Who's Back""!! Yes, a film crew follows Oliver Masucci as he impersonates Hitler and plays it 100% straight!Unlike ""Borat"" where you know that it's just Sasha Baron Cohen pretending to be from Kazakstan, in this film Masucci plays it as if he really is Hitler and never breaks character. When the film begins, he is inexplicably transported from Germany in 1945 to the present day. At first, he's very confused. Then, he develops a plan...to return to politics and take Germany into the future! To do this, he enlists the help of an unemployed filmmaker, Sawatski...and together they travel throughout the country...meeting people, talking politics and becoming an internet phenomenon! Where does all this lead to? See this very insightful film.The idea of this film is thoroughly distasteful and I actually thought might be illegal in light of German laws about the portrayal of Nazis and Hitler. However, the film manages to somehow be funny, great political commentary and not as distasteful and awful as you might imagine. This is because some of the folks in this film are not actors...and their reactions to Hitler are incredibly telling. Many of them seem to like Hitler and his message...especially regarding the negative influence immigrants have made on Germany. Again and again, folks agree with 'Hitler' and his crazy ideas while others just think it's a funny or incredibly unfunny joke...and these reactions are indeed fascinating. In addition, the way that television takes to him and his crass message is a real indictment of the moral bankruptcy of many in the media...and one that is highly reminiscent of the great 70s parody, Network.Before you start sending me hate mail, I suggest you try seeing this odd and incredibly offensive film for yourself. While it clearly is wrong on one level...it manages to actually have some incredible political and social commentary...making it clever and a sad indictment of the culture and the media. The film's contention, amazingly, is that he'd probably fit in just fine if such a thing actually did happen! What an unusual and compelling movie...and one that just debuted on Netflix this month. Clearly, you ain't seen nothing' until you've seen this one!",Look Who's Back
1,Horst_In_Translation,"Good movie, but would have been better as 100% comedy",6,2 November 2015,"""Er ist wieder da"" is the newest movie by writer and director David Wnendt and just like his last one ""Feuchtgebiete"", it is based on a novel. It's Wnendt's 3rd pretty well-known movie and just like with the one I already mentioned and with ""Kriegerin"", he cast a fairly unknown actor as the lead actor again. I am not aware with Oliver Masucci, but according to his filmography he has not been in movies/television since 2011. Still, he did a pretty good job here. As the film continues during its almost 2 hours, it becomes more and more dramatic while still containing comedy elements. I am not saying it was a failure dramatically as there is an interesting take on our society today and also on the quality of German television at this point that is very critical and inspires you to think. However, I believe this film works best during the funny parts.For example, Hitler hanging out all day long in paper stores or him mistaking ""Arbeitslage"" für ""Arbeitslager"" was hilarious. And Christoph Maria Herbst imitating the famous meltdown by Hitler from ""Der Untergang"" was just priceless. I also found the quote funny that ""Jews"" are not funny and should not be part of the comedy program/movie, which was quite an interesting reference in terms of us actually watching the movie and they included it the very same moment they criticized it allegedly. Yes this is certainly a film which is not particularly politically correct, not to say not politically correct at all. Just remember the racist jokes scene. Still, this is exactly my kind of humor and I enjoyed most of the comedy in here. However, I felt that some of the dramatic sequences lacked focus or just relevance other than making this film look more significant than it actually was. I am not sure why these were included. The are so many serious German films about Nazis, not only historical ones, so it was really not too necessary to add this one to the list. I would have preferred a 100% comedy movie. And I did not like the ending at all, possibly the weakest part of the film. It felt like Wnendt/Vermes wanted to go out on a boom, but it was just a big mess in my opinion with the boundaries between reality and fiction blurring more and more until they disappear to the audience. Not very convincing here. Too smart for its own good. Still, as a whole, this was a good film, entertaining 115 minutes and I recommend it. If you like it, also make sure to check out Helge Schneider's Hitler film. Very funny as well.",Look Who's Back
2,kosmasp,Laugh or cry?,6,20 April 2016,"He's back .. on the big and small screen that is. Hitler will always be a (dark) part of German History. And a book was released a while ago, that had him coming back, seeing what the world became after he went away. Since I haven't read the book, although it was highly suggested to me by a friend, I cannot comment on what is missing from the book.What I can say is that it looks like the movie is 50 % book related material and 50 % ""Borat"" style material. What do I mean by the latter? Hitler is going out on the streets, meeting real people and talking to them. Reactions there seem to be real, as the end credits show, when he is driving through Berlin and people wave at him, chuckle and think it's funny. Unfortunately right now, the situation in Germany doesn't seem as funny and people from the right wing win a lot of people over who are frustrated with the state of politics today ... not thinking clearly and spewing hate. Something that is very obvious in the movie too.Is that funny or entertaining? That depends on the viewer ...",Look Who's Back
3,ComedyFan2010,An interesting message in a movie with a creative idea,8,17 June 2017,"A movie with a great idea of Hitler waking up in our time based on the book with the same title.I liked it for the most part. I liked the idea and how it was written. Bringing the humor and at the same time sending a message with it. It is especially well done how the movie flows. At first it is more of a lighthearted comedy which gets more serious with the time and the last scenes of it are not about humor anymore but summarizing the idea of how Hitler would have a chance in our time to repeat the history. |We get the mockumentary moments where Hitler talks to people and they give him their views on current politics and what bothers them. I have looked into it and seems that they were all staged and just presented as real interviews. It is pretty well done though how most look at Hitler not as a history monster but entertainment and are exited to take selfies with him.The portrayal of Hitler by Oliver Masucci is great. He presents the Hitler energy and charismatic speaking very well. He makes us kind of like Hitler. He is that interesting outspoken guy even though in the back of our mind his crimes against humans in the past remind us of who he really is. And from time to time his actions, like killing the dog, bring us back to reality that he is not a nice human being. Yet this portrayal of Hitler as a man we are drawn to and enjoy listening what he says about wanting to improve his country instead of showing him as a caricature monster shows how we can still be influenced and manipulated these days even by somebody with the views that we are so sure we will not repeat by having learned from the past.The scenes of him talking on TV and being taken in are also a great part of it. As well as some people realizing that he is not seeing just as a comedian by people as he was in the beginning but that they actually like what he says. This is this nice transition of people being taken in but what they think is harmless entertainment and swallowing propaganda. We have also a great scene of the grandma looking at Hitler and recognizing him from the past which gives a comment on this with her remembering how at first people were also seeing him as harmless.Besides the main idea of the movie I also enjoyed some laughs at Hitler discovering the modern world. Especially him going to dry cleaning, watching TV and being upset over so many cook shows selecting the Greens as his favorite party and exploring the internet which he then sees as a great propaganda tool which it is.I guess I am just not too much into the very left wing bias which makes us think of every person who has any concerns and does not 100% agree with the left. Mind you I have never voted for the right wing. But I am irritated by every person leaning right being linked with Hitler. There is noting eye opening or revolutionary about it, it is the norm of today. Left propaganda is as real as the right one and I have felt a slight stench of it in this movie. I am interested in reading the book now because from what I have read it is not having those propaganda elements but is an intelligent book with a thought provoking message.But for the most part I liked the movie. It had it all together, a creative idea, good acting, fun and serious moments and a way to bring the view of the ones making it in a creative way.",Look Who's Back
4,grantss,"Incredibly funny, just a pity about the uneven dramatic element",7,6 October 2018,"Adolf Hitler wakes up in Berlin...in 2015. After getting his bearings he is discovered by an unemployed TV producer, Fabian Sawatzki. Sawatzki thinks Hitler is some sort of performance artist and takes him around the country, talking to the general population, for a TV piece he has envisaged. Hitler, however, sees this as a chance to regain his popularity and power.From the synopsis you know already this is hardly your average movie. The central plot is quite preposterous but works. Hitler coming to terms with 2015 has a Borat-like feel to it (which is a very good thing) and, like Borat, leads to some really funny moments. It also provides an opportunity to critique our modern lifestyle - the whole ""you have this wonderful medium called television and yet you fill it with banal, unintelligent crap like cooking shows"" observation was absolute gold.However, while it works very well as a comedy, this is undermined by writer-director David Wnendt trying to turn it into a drama with a political and social message. Nothing wrong with that, generally, but it is quite badly done here. The plot and message are incredibly muddled, and mostly seem to consist of having a go at the right-wing of German politics, without proposing any alternatives or solutions. At one stage there is even the implication that democracy is bad because it allows the Hitlers of this world to be elected. Ok, but what's your alternative?It also doesn't help that you need to know a fair bit about current German politics and societal problems to understand the issues and get some of the jabs, and I don't.The dramatic part of the movie spills over into the comedic part, in that it ruins the flow of the comedy. Furthermore, it is difficult to take the dramatic parts seriously, after the comedic element. This said, it is never dull and when it's good, it's great. The scene that parodies the famous war-room scene from Downfall is brilliant - very clever.All this is enhanced significantly by a superb performance by Oliver Masucci as Hitler. He looks like Hitler and has the mannerisms now pat - incredibly convincing.",Look Who's Back
5,Uriah43,A Comedy with a Serious Message,7,7 May 2016,"This movie begins with the person of ""Adolf Hitler"" (Oliver Masucci) being resurrected in 2014 from the exact place where his body was doused in gasoline and hurriedly buried. As he awakens he discovers that things are not the same as when he left. However, although the Germany he knew no longer exists the ideals that he once possessed still remain and he immediately goes about assessing his new environment in order to adapt his message to the people of today. At first everybody assumes that he has merely assumed Hitler's image in order to facilitate his role as a comedian. But the more he speaks to mass audiences the more people realize that he is quite serious-and they like what he has to say. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, although this movie certainly has its share of humor, it also contains a much deeper message which some people may not be able to understand. For that reason this film is much more than a mere comedy-it's a warning of what can happen when people allow politicians to manipulate their darker impulses in order to gain power. And Germans aren't the only people capable of falling into that trap. At any rate, all things considered this turned out to be a pretty good movie and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",Look Who's Back
6,bombersflyup,A fascinating premise.,8,8 April 2020,"Look Who's Back is engaging, funny, clever and original. Oliver Masucci terrific as Hitler.Almost brilliant, however the drama elements aren't up to par, nor does it finish memorably, given the level attained and avenues available.",Look Who's Back
7,Wizard-8,Intriguing idea is handled inconsistently,5,11 April 2020,"The idea behind this movie - Hitler finding himself in the 21st century and reacting to (and using) modern day Germans and new technology - is one that's both very intriguing and full of potential satire and humor. However, the end results are kind of a mess. On the positive side, the movie's dark attitude to the drama sometimes really hits the target, revealing that some evil opinions are still in a lot of German citizens and could be reactivated easily, as well as giving a plausible look as to what Hitler would use in this day and age (such as the Internet) to get what he wanted. At the same time there is plenty of absurdity that prevent things from being so black that all the entertainment is sucked out.But the movie has just as many flaws as it does virtues. One flaw for some viewers who are not German is that the movie seems squarely aimed at a German audience who will understand all the references to present (and past) German society. I admit that some references left me scratching my head. Another problem is that the story really jumps all over the place. Plot threads are dropped for a long time before resuming, the improvised bits don't really fit with the scripted material, and there are also a lot of unanswered questions here and there. A third problem is that the production values are quite often pretty tacky and cheap, which makes this world have less of a believability than what was intended.So as you can see, the movie has its ups and downs. Is it worth watching? Maybe. I would recommend you start by watching the first thirty minutes. If you find enough interest (and also are able to look past the flaws), you might get enough out of the entire movie, especially if you can watch it for free. Though it may be best to watch the movie in thirty minute chunks so that the flaws don't get too overwhelming at any sitting.",Look Who's Back
8,deloudelouvain,Not bad but not great either,6,14 February 2017,Even though German is not the most pleasant language to listen to because it all sounds so aggressive all the time in this movie it works rather well because Adolf Hitler's speeches were also aggressive all the time. The movie itself is a dark comedy with sometimes a political view of modern society. It shows a lot of what is happening in Europe and what people complain about. Well at least what right wing people complain about and think about the situation because I couldn't care less about races and ethnicity's. You have good and bad people in all ethnicity's. The movie has some funny moments. I know I laughed a couple of times but for the majority of the movie I thought it was sometimes a bit long. Oliver Masucci as Adolf Hitler plays his role really good though. He has the physics and the perfect intonation in his voice to play Hitler. It's a good movie to watch once but I won't watch it a second time.,Look Who's Back
9,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"If it walks, talks and acts like a duck...",6,17 January 2020,"'Look Who's Back (2015)' walks on very thin ice for its entire duration. In fact, you're not even sure it isn't going to fall in until its final few moments. It's a dark satire that ponders over what might happen if Hitler somehow arrived in the 21st century, using a mix of real-life and staged footage. Basically, it posits that the same attitudes that led to Hitler's rise to power in the 1930s are still prevalent today. It tackles a plethora of themes and is only subtly opposed to them, trusting its audience to understand what it's trying to say. However, you'll only get out of it what you put into it; if you think Hitler was a diabolical person with diabolical beliefs then the flick will reaffirm that, if not... well, you're no friend of mine. The thing finds its success in its brazen ability to cut to the candid heart of the issues it tackles, working much more as a fairly disturbing drama than as an 'edgy' comedy. It isn't all that well-made and it isn't hugely entertaining. It's strangely engaging, though, which is partially because you're constantly trying to figure out where it stands. It also bends its documentary, mockumentary and traditional sequences rather well, helped by an all-in lead performance and the actor's uncanny ability to improvise in character. The affair is slightly hypocritical in that it says you shouldn't give a platform to the sort of hate Hitler spews (even if it's masquerading as satire), yet does exactly that simply by featuring it (even though, ultimately, it decries it). It's an interesting and often uncomfortable watch that's difficult to put your finger on. In the end, I think it's decent. 6/10",Look Who's Back
10,bowmanblue,"Brutal, brave, brilliant",10,23 May 2016,"A comedy. Starring Hitler. Yes, it's a difficult premise to grasp, but bear with me. If you've watched any of the promotional material, you may be forgiven for thinking that it's akin to something Sacha Baron Cohen might do, i.e. a spoof character mingling with the general public and us observing/laughing at their reactions. That is technically true, but 'Look Who's Back' is so much more. And so much scarier.It is a comedy. For our most unlikely of 'heroes' Adolf Hitler simply disappears from his last moments of the Second World War and wakes up in modern day Germany (yeah, I know – it's a stretch, but it's necessary for the plot). Then, the first half of the movie is basically Oliver Masucci staying in character as Hitler at all times as he wanders the streets of Germany (being filmed secretly in some cases) and then we observe the reactions of the public. If anyone doesn't laugh at the scenes with Hitler meeting a little dog or discovering the joys of the Internet for the first time then there's something wrong. It is true comedy gold.However, the film isn't just one long collection of set pieces. It's actually got some story to it, too. The scripted portions of the film show how Hitler is treated like a crank and given his own spots on TV. This leads to him actually becoming loved as people just think that he's a comedian playing the dictator (which, of course, he is – but for the purposes of the film we have to believe that he is actually the REAL Hitler).Both the fly-on-the-wall parts and scripted parts are equally uncomfortable. Not only do some people – basically – openly agree with what Hitler says, but the scripted parts portray an eerie sense of what could happen if the real Hitler (or someone just like him) was around today and allowed to rise through the modern day media.I won't go into the ending as it's possibly the most pivotal part of the film. I will just say that 'Look Who's Back' is enjoyable, if very uncomfortable and in many cases horrific. I know that 'funny' and 'horrific' don't always go hand in hand, but this film manages it quite well. The scene when an old Jewish woman who actually lived through Hitler's Germany in the forties finally 'outs' the dictator for who he really is still gives me goosebumps.You have to be in the mood for something this dark, but it is certainly an achievement of film-making and also Oliver Masucci deserves credit for daring to go out in public not only dressed as possibly the most hated man of all time, but to act like him, too.",Look Who's Back

13,Platypuschow,Er ist wieder da: Walks a fine line between offensive and genius,6,14 May 2019,"This German made movie is a lot of things, but forgettable certainly isn't one of them.It tells the story of Adolf Hitler as he wakes up in 2014 dazed and confused. He sets about finding his place in this new world and is quickly picked up by the media as an entertainment sensation.It's a hard movie to pigeon hole, it's genre would be very difficult to clarify. One thing is for certain it's justifiably controversial but things aren't as simple as they first appear.This movie isn't propaganda, it has no agenda, I can see people on the left calling this a right wing movie, I can see people on the right calling this a left wing movie. Truth be told it's about as centrist as it could possibly be and is a powerful piece of social commentary.With strong performances especially by leading man Oliver Masucci (Hitler) it's a remarkable piece that walks a fine line between offensive and genius.It's not funny, it's not exactly dramatic but it is fairly clever and certainly memorable.I can understand why a lot of people would be disgusted by the film. It's comparable to if they made a movie about Jimmy Saville returning from the grave and opening a daycare center. It's eyebrow raising, it's questionable, but if you watch it with an open mind and really pay attention to what you're watching you'll see it's remarkably deep.Not for everyone, but is a fascinating watch no matter your social or political leanings.The Good:Oliver MasucciVery cleverMemorableThe Bad:Causes the skin to crawl in placesHighly questionable",Look Who's Back
14,Reno-Rangan,"He's obviously the same person, but his intentions are?",7,14 April 2016,"I enjoyed the director's previous works like 'Combat Girls' and 'Wetlands'. Those were young women oriented subjects, yet filled with sensitive topics. But now he turned his focus towards the screen adaptation of a bestselling satirical novel of the same name about Adolf Hitler. Well, this is not his best work, not a bad movie either.Quite fun to watch, but not logical, especially the basic ones. Since it mocks a most hated person in the human history, there's no issues on portraying him in whatever angle they wanted, because nobody cares. Yet the film talked some serious current issues of Germany.This is like when 'Borat' meets 'The Dictator'. A man who wanders around a city looking for some answers. That's none other than Adolf Hitler, who wakes up in the middle of where some young kids showing their football skills for a TV programme. Then he embarks to learn where he's and what year it is. Meets a person who helps him and ultimately end up with some TV guy where they begin their journey throughout the nation making videos before landing in an actual TV show. The man who killed millions of people wants the best for Germany and its people, how he turn things around were narrated in a quite interesting perspective.The initial narratives were like the aimless, that tells us what people think of the Adolf Hitler's return. Looked like most of them were shot like a documentary style, outside the official shooting spots. You can see lots of real people's faces were censored. We know that he wanted to be an artist, but he draws some funny sketches in this. Likewise there are many scenes about his qualities that were dragged in to make fun out of it.Can people accept the words of one who is considered a villain. He came from a different timeline, but he quickly absorbs the situation and gives some important tips that should come into force. From the common people's perspective, it is an entertaining product, but from the political viewpoint, there are stuffs to consider severely about.""When you have rats at home, it is called not a clown but an exterminator.""To me there's nothing controversial about this theme. When he failed, the final pages of his history book were written by his enemies. Otherwise, there's no difference between him, Alexander and Genghis Khan. Every greatest kings who ever lived on the earth dreamed of conquering the world.I think the present world is same, except the form of conquering is changed, like some want to rule the world with their strong economy like the US and some are on their cheap industrial products like China. Like that all the other nations are on the top of the chart with something in what they're good at.Adolf Hitler was a politician, not a king, but he had his reasons for his actions. So if we go by the rule books, nothing seems rational. To me this film was a decent entertainer, I just wanted to enjoy what it offers and I think I did. I advise the same that you should not mix up this with the reality. Because that might take us to the unwanted territory.He's the same person who came from the past, but I was keen to know his intentions, especially what the writer intended to draw out of him. Because he's alone, not with his army, so he had no power, but his interaction with people brings up some discussable topics. I'm not a German, but it made me think when he spoke about current issues that Germany is facing. Every nation has to think about its internal affairs to improve it, you can't live forever with the past shame.This film might be a comedy, but you can't ignore some of the points the main character talks. I felt the movie was a double strike where people can have some laughs and in other side to learn the reality of the state.

The story opens with Hitler, the Hitler from 1930's, awakening in a garden in the city, confused and interacting with everyday Germans. People's reactions range from expected anger at the image of Hitler to laughing, pointing and waving at what weirdo impersonates Hitler in full military dress. A local news channel discovers him and gives him airtime as an amusing Hitler impersonator who never breaks character.

19,t-dooley-69-386916,Hitler in a comedy that rocks!,9,3 May 2016,"'Er ist wieder da' is the original title of this absolute gem of a film from Germany and it is a comedy – of sorts. The plot is that Adolf materialises in 2014 straight from 1945 and is totally befuddled as to what has happened to the rubble, the enemy aircraft and why the youth don't seem to recognise him or even worse they don't know how to do the Nazi salute.We have the parallel story of Fabian Sawatzki who is a freelance film maker in need of a break and he sees 'Der Fuhrer' as a handy meal ticket back into TV. So begins the odyssey and to say this is inspired is a massive understatement.This is a comedy and it is the most I have laughed in ages. The idea of juxtaposing Hitler's views as comedy material is genius. Now there is a big however here and that is his views are still pretty offensive even in this context. The actor playing him is Oliver Masucci and he is an absolute show stealer. Some of this has been adlibbed on actual German streets and other situations and some of the reactions of the public are remarkable for all the right and wrong reasons. This is though an incredibly refreshing and novel film that I am so glad I got to see – I saw it on Netflix and this justifies my monthly subscription for the next six months – this will not be for everyone but if you are open to a new twist on bad things then you will hopefully enjoy this as much as I did.",Look Who's Back

21,SquigglyCrunch,"Boring, Unfunny, and Really Just Shouldn't Exist",3,29 April 2016,"Look Who's Back tells the story of Adolf Hitler who, upon magically traveling through time to modern day Germany, ends up in the public eye and becomes a stand-up comedian. The plot is funny, I think at least. The idea itself looks good on paper, but when the movie starts it really isn't. It feels like it's a movie made to advertise the director's agreements with Hitler in politics rather than to entertain people. Seriously, at least half this movie is just Hitler interviewing people and asking why they hate politics, and it's boring as heck. Maybe for someone who loves German politics it'd be funny, but for the general public it really isn't. Furthermore, some of the other humor is pretty insensitive. Now don't get me wrong, I like the little Hitler joke here and there, but the jokes in this movie really weren't okay. I hate to be the guy who doesn't like a movie because he doesn't agree with it, but I think most people can agree that when Jews got sent to concentration camps and gassed that it wasn't very funny and that it really isn't okay under any circumstances to laugh at that. And yet, this movie seemed to think that that was okay. Funny or not, however, this movie still ended up being incredibly boring and uninteresting. The characters are okay, but they all seem the same. They all think Hitler is hilarious, and they won't stop talking about him. Some of them have their clear traits, but they're pretty clichéd traits that don't go any deeper. At least the acting was decent though.Overall Look Who's Back is just an insensitive, unfunny and boring satire with okay characters and decent acting.

23,jayjaycee,Shocking and exposing,7,1 June 2020,"""Er ist wieder da (Look who's back)"" is a 2015 German satirical comedy directed by David Wnendt starring Oliver Masucci and Fabian Busch. I'm wrapping up the month with one of the most popular and critically acclaimed feature films of the recent years from my own home country of Germany. Based upon his own novel of the same name writer-director Wnendt created a film that asks an absurd but not less curiosity provoking question: What if Adolf Hitler lived in the twenty-first century? There have been several parodies and adaptions that depicted the life and death of the infamous dictator, but no film has ever dealt with that question of what would happen if he was still alive. The results of this feature film are simply astonishing. First of all, the actor who plays Hitler, Oliver Masucci, does an incredible job as the tyrant and even if he isn't as accurate as Bruno Ganz in ""Downfall"" (mainly because he is too tall), it is sufficient in this context, as he is still able to portray the most important characteristics of him. While the performances of most actors are basically wooden and bland and more cringe worthy than acceptable, he is tolerable and fortunately carries the film with his sheer presence. But what is it that makes this film so utterly interesting? Well, the simple fact that most scenes were improvised in a ""Borat"" kind of way and captured the genuine reaction of the people. For instance, in one sequence in the very beginning they went to the Brandenburg Gate and just pointed the camera at Masucci who, obviously dressed up as the dictator, walked around and entered the crowds. It is his gift for improvisation that makes it so shocking and absurd at the same time, as he reacted to whatever the unaware people gave him. And what most people did was nothing short of shocking. While most people stood there and stared at him in total disbelief, it was unsettling to see that the majority approached him and took selfies with him while doing the Hitler salute and exclaiming fascist paroles. For our modern society that allegedly knows better than their ancestors back in the day, this is a pathetic display. As if that wasn't already enough, it goes even further and tackles enough other topics. I mean, you have got a man who claims to be the man responsible for millions of deaths and instead of calling the police or initiating his arrestment, nobody does anything about it. Instead, supporting character Sawatzki makes it possible for him to appear on television and share his world view over again. Before he gets there, though, he embarks on a road trip with him and is letting him interview a diversity of people who let the former head of state know about their biggest worries. Again, all those reactions are unscripted and mirror the opinions of the individuals asked. From baiting towards refugees, over people who give full scope about their fascist world view to people who still believe that the Third Reich was the best thing that has ever happened to Germany, you get all of it. And that is shocking and sad. Most people casually say that some situations like in the thirties could never happen again, since the people of today were more enlightened nowadays. While this is luckily the case with most citizens, there are still too many people who have such a human right violating opinion about so many things. As you can see in the case of this film, it only takes one guy dressed up as Hitler and they tell you everything. But it is not only what a few people think. As Hitler gets to appear on live television, he manages to share his ideas all over again, and surprisingly, intended by the writers of the film, this fictional version of him tells a lot of ""relatable stuff"". While it is obvious that the real Hitler never would have shared the exact same mindset as his fictional counterpart, the version in this film has a few ""plausible thoughts"" (I am putting this in quotation marks, as it is not my own political opinion!). Beforehand, the writers did it deliberately to give him views that criticise the current social injustice, so that the viewer could relate to what he has said. Another thing that contributes to the effect that this alleged Hitler imitator gains more and more popularity is that not a single soul takes him seriously and that he is introduced as a comedy act. Under the veil of humour, he gets a platform to reach and teach the nation about his world view once again. What lead to him becoming popular once again, though? Well, as already mentioned, nobody takes him seriously and the media, in this case fictional network ""MyTV"", prize profit over moral and use this sensation, the spectacular return of the mass murderer for their own success. Of course, it is almost impossible that the real Hitler was still alive in the 21st century, but isn't it strange enough that nobody takes legal actions against someone who doesn't only dress up as him but also shares the same fascist mindset? Like, it is legally prohibited in Germany to dress up as him. Well, in the end he manages to regain his old popularity and is once again a celebrity. As he says himself, back in the day the people elected him legitimately and wanted him to be their chief of state. Nobody forced them to vote for him, nobody considered him to be the evil man, he then continues. And this statement is shocking because it is sadly true. That is why the film ends with him as a man with celebrity status, and thus the film states that it would indeed be possible for someone like him to regain power, as enough German people still have a racist world view. That the film ends with a montage of bystanders doing the Hitler salute is the final proof that many people have a lot to catch up on. All in all, this satirical comedy gives an alarming insight into the political views of too many Germans and mirrors what the saddening reality in this modern country is. While it could have been even more snappy, it is enough to point out the worrying truth and teach the viewer to be more tolerant. It is marginal, provocative but hits the bullseye. A great satirical comedy that shows us that we Germans of today may not be to blame for what our ancestors have done, but that we are responsible for something like that to never happen again. And that is something that sadly many people still must learn.",Look Who's Back

Going in to it I was expecting a comedy, some satire, maybe a political message. it ends up being boring.

The plausibility of a person impersonating Hitler being able to get so many people behind his message is just ridiculous. People are radical yes, but eventually someone would run his fingerprints or things like that and realize he is the real one and he would be locked up or executed.

27,tributarystu,An Exercise in Challenging the Norm,7,24 October 2015,"I was traveling in Berlin a year ago when I first saw someone reading the eponymous book on which this movie is based. It stuck in a corner of my mind, so as my travels brought me back to Berlin and posters were advertising ""Er ist wieder da"", I had to give it a go. The challenge, as with previous comedic movies themed around Hitler or the Nazi regime, is treading the line of reasonable taste and still being challenging enough to gain some relevance. One of the best known spoofs of the times, The Producers, uses it as a pivot to tell an engaging story about several memorable characters, so that works well. But here, there's little to pivot from, as Hitler, in realistic attire and demeanor, narrates his experience of present day Germany. So the twist, in part, is to make it a mockumentary in the spirit of Borat, see how people react to Hitler walking the streets and delivering his calculated critiques of the political system, the media - life in general. When it's not doing this, the film provides a decent dose of slapstick and irony to its more obviously scripted parts. Distinguishing one from the other is not really the key to enjoyment; the key lies in accepting this faithful representation of Hitler as a grotesquely humorous caricature of the symbolic power he holds over modern history in its most extreme moments. It was a bit harder than I thought it would be at the beginning, but one settles in well, after a while.Narratively, not much really happens, other than the fact that the protagonist pops up in Berlin and gets acquainted to what the world is like nowadays. To help him in this, a few support characters act as guides; none believe him to be ""the real thing"", but rather a comedian or a satirist. So, in a sense, it's not really a very ambitious film, because the degree to which it engages with the moral dimension of the situation is limited. But it is ambitious in that it tries to keep a straight face even through the more ghastly, touch-and-go moments one would relate to a Hitler movie. It is at its best when it does this, but then the occasional piece of slapstick hits you in the face are you're back into the reality of a mildly amusing film that people have only heard of because it is polemic.An important part in the whole thing coming together reasonably well is thanks to Oliver Masucci, who offers a strong performance to keep the ""pots"" in balance. Perhaps one could critique this in particular: the implication is that any piece of fiction told in the first person will make the viewer empathize with the character, hence humanizing the historical figure. But the historical figure itself is merely a representation of the man and ""Er ist wieder da"" tries to contextualize this - make away with what you know and imagine this were pre-1933. As mentioned, it doesn't go very deep with it and it would be quite problematic to do so. It's just a thought experiment which concludes in a slightly open and ambiguous fashion. To address the real question though: did I laugh? Yes, I did. Did I enjoy it? Yes, I did. The film managed to create an amusing environment which plays off the character of Hitler, without making it the other way around (all the time). As for the big picture, I might not agree that the world is, collectively, where it was seventy years ago, in spite of the troubles we are currently facing, especially in Europe. Or that we would make the same mistakes all over again. But that's another story of me visiting Berlin.",Look Who's Back

Like the movie The Visitors, but then with Hitler. A fish out of water kinda flick. Well it's NOT that kind of movie (well maybe just a little). This one tries to be more of a social commentary: it alludes to the rise of right wing parties (no alcohol required) and right wing sentiments among civilians fueled by the constant influx of Islamic immigrants and the (often not working) multicultural society. It suggests people would forget history all to easily and back a man (who they know is evil) simply because he can be quite convincing and opportunistically promises to finally do right by the people and clean up the place so to speak. I won't say it's left wing propaganda, but it certainly tips over that way in it's commentary and the filmmakers do have a point, we should not forget history all to easily but we should not ignore our problems either and hope they will simply go away but do something before it goes too far. Purely as a film I would say they could have done more with the subject. You could probably make an endless series of films about how it would be for Hitler in the 21st century, some more comical or dramatic then others. I would call 'Er est wieder da' a honorable try but it leaves potential on the table. I would say give it a go if the subject fancies your interest or if you just like films with Hitler in them, but know what to expect.",Look Who's Back

Well, this semi-documentary has got some pretty damn good ideas about that. As his character himself put it ""I live in each and every one of you"" so basically his ideas will never fully have died within the minds and souls of everyone because people like to hate other people; they thrive on their hatred and that's why such people are so easy to manipulate. It's easy to say that you can get rid of the problem by eliminating it but does that solve the problem itself? It's easy to say that you can make the people equal in their rights but will it suffice to all of them? Most of today's people with their heads full of TV-ad-propaganda are easily manipulated as well, sadly, and that is why, I think, it wouldn't make much of a difference if someone like Hitler had come to the stage to ""save the world"" again. The movie bares no cinematic impact upon the industry or the viewer himself but provides only the food for thoughts, a great deal of them actually.

30,wvisser-leusden,connecting Hitler to Europe's present immigration problems,9,30 November 2015,"First of all, 'Er ist wieder da' (= German for 'Here he is again') stands out for the magnificent performance by Oliver Masucci of the Adolf Hitler-role -- which I think deserves an Oscar.Carried by this, 'Er ist wieder da' makes a very German, if not European, film. Which, I guess, may be difficult to understand for Americans. In the end its plot focuses on European immigration, and everything that comes with it. Seriously presenting the issue in a neutral and correct way, indicating its big political complications.But before we get there, the film offers plenty of fun. In particular in its beginning. Hitler wakes up on the same spot where he left in 1945: Berlin city center. And starts exploring the Berlin of 2014 with a full 1945-mindsetting. Thus releasing some great slapstick, which truly made tears of laughter stream down my cheeks.However, it does not take Hitler long to discover email and internet. He understands its great potential very quickly, and gets on to a new huge career as a television-star. So far the plot of 'Er ist wieder da'.

33,Radu_A,"Decent adaptation, but with too much meandering and pathos",6,6 April 2016,"""Er ist wieder da"" by Timur Vermes was an huge success when it came out in 2011 and sold about 2.3 million copies. The film's admissions matched that number - but initial expectations were way higher, given that ""Fack ju Göhte 2"", the sequel to a highly successful high school comedy, had 7.7m admissions. Maybe that's because the film takes quite a few liberties with the book's story and style. The book never clarifies whether Hitler is the real deal or not. The film introduces pseudo-documentary snippets of Hitler's encounters with non-actors - that's not in the book, and in fact either a reminiscence or a rip-off of the similarly themed ""Muxmäuschenstill"" (2004). There's less drama in the book - the film makers feel obliged to put it into the context of the rise of the political right in the wake of the refugee crisis, which feels a bit off at times, even though it may make sense in a broader context. Most importantly, the book is mainly Hitler's assumed views of today's world, which make for the best parts of the film. But it tries hard to be more than that, a broader social critique of Germany today, which lets the plot drift too much between secondary characters who do not advance the story. When the film takes a moral stance, it becomes kind of overbearing - especially at the end, when a collage of refugee-crisis-induced violence and barter is included to scare the audience into thinking that the next Hitler may be just around the corner. That defeats the purpose of satire. It's a good example for the German expression ""der erhobene Zeigefinder"", the ""risen index finger"", which means by trying to educate people at all cost, you end up alienating them. The book allows the readers to come to their own conclusions, which is probably the secret to its success.The aforementioned ""Muxmäuschenstill"" AKA ""Quiet as a Mouse"" is a much better critique of ""Germanism"", because it maintains a steady, unflinching approach on the subject of a secret lust for leaders and order.",Look Who's Back

Adrian Brody did it in ""Life Is Beautiful"" about life in a concentration camp. ""Look Who's Back"" does it via the premise that Adolf Hitler returns to modern day Germany. Of course everyone believes that he is an actor - one who disturbingly never steps out of character. The audience knows that he cannot - as he actually is Hitler. Much of the film is humorous as Hitler tries to reestablish himself as ""The Fuhrer"" and tries to understand and cope with modern day technology and attitudes.Oliver Masucci is brilliant as Hitler -playing the role so straight that he became very scary near the end. The brilliance of Hitler was aptly demonstrated as people began responding to the hate - filled rhetoric he employed on various television shows. In real life the industrialists supported Hitler because they were sure they could control him - they could not. The church supported him because they thought he would be useful to them and that they could control him - they could not. Finally the German Army threw in with him because they wanted to get rid of their rivals - Hitler's ""brown shirt"" Army - the Sturmabteilung (SA). He got rid of Strasser and Rohm and thousands of others as he dismantled the organization which carried him to power. But alas the Army also could not control him.In the movie, he becomes a media star because of viewership and ratings. We see glimpses of the audience saying like ""I think I agree with him, and he makes a lot of sense."" The TV moguls are building their careers on his outrageousness and resulting popularity.His grasp on people is creepy, insidious and feels quite realistic. This film shows you how riveting he could be - and gives you a glimpse into how he came to power. So, beyond laughs - the message clearly is that this could happen again. We must be aware of potential dictators in our midst. A few people in the movie saw that he really was Hitler - and they were discarded at the end of the movie.This movie is not a condemnation of Germany - past or present. Hitler in the movie postulates at the end of the film that we cannot get rid of him - because he is a part of us. I hope that is not true.",Look Who's Back
37,BoomerDT,Promising Satire Falls Apart at End,6,15 March 2017,"Recently caught this on Netflix. I like satirical comedy about taboo subjects. Got hooked by the movie's original preposterous premise, that Adolf Hitler, of all people, has been resurrected and returns to life to Berlin about 70 years after his suicide. For the first half of the movie the director has fun with this notion, although much of it is the amazement any person would have from post 20th century on in returning 70 years after their deaththe incredible inventions and technological breakthroughs that have come at a breakneck pace are mind boggling. There is also a similarity between ""LWB"" and ""Borat"" as this is done in a mockumentary style, as the citizenry in Germany react to the sight of a man who resembles and reacts as Hitler going through day to day like in modern Deutschland. Good enough and there are some funny and outrageous moments and Nazi Germany can be cleverly satirized, as Mel Brooks did with the ""Springtime for Hitler"" sequence in ""The Producers"" or as in the underrated 60's sit-com, ""Hogan's Heroes."" But ""LWB"" descends into a not so subtle comment into what the left perceive as racist xenophobia. That is the very real threat to Germany and virtually all of Western Europe of the invasion of Muslim refugees, who have absolutely no interest in assimilating into the prevailing culture. I might also add that if Hitler were to come back today he would find he shares a common conviction with most of the Muslim world.

Some are happy to see Hitler; some are angry.

Busch's associates at a failing German TV network (Christoph Maria Herbst and Katja Riemann) soon realize this Hitler lookalike is a boon for their ratings... until it becomes apparent that he may not be an actor after all.It's predictable for the first two thirds, but the final third gets a bit trippy and surreal, which I very much appreciated. And the film has some surprisingly touching and dramatic scenes sprinkled in amid all the goofy comedy - this is Hitler, after all, and the crimes he committed are directly addressed in a serious way.While those serious and dramatic bits sometimes clash with the comedic ones, overall this is a fun, unique German satire that should keep you entertained and may even make you think (plus it'll scratch a particular itch for those who love Sacha Baron Cohen's ""Borat"").

39,Cinnyaste,Brilliant Commentary Of Contemporary Society Through A Forties Lens,8,8 April 2016,"""Look Who's Back"" posits Hitler floats down - from somewhere - to land in an abandoned Berlin lot seventy years after his suicide. A bold idea backed up by a smart, funny and incisive script (that closely follows the book) delivered by a good cast. The resulting package is thought provoking, shocking and, at times, hilarious.Initially seen a laughable street performer, a foggy Herr Hitler walks Berlin's streets searching for the Führerbunker and wonders what happened to the thousand year Reich. He takes selfies with bemused tourists, and gets into a fight with a mime who's ticked-off his thunder is taken by an icon of terror.Hitler falls in with a hapless TV journalist who becomes his traveling companion on a cross-Germany trip to learn what's bugging people, and what they desire. They honestly tell him - believing he's an actor and not the real thing - about wages and education. Mostly, the people are vocal with despicable hate for immigrants. Here, Muslims fill in for Jews who are barely mentioned.In a brilliant bit of dialogue, a working class German states Muslims have IQs of fifty or sixty. Hitler asks what is the average German's IQ. The worker tells him eighty. (80-89 — Below average: Can perform explicit routinized hands-on tasks without supervision as long as there are no moments of choice and it is always clear what has to be done.) Hitler discovers TV and wonders why this technological marvel broadcasts mostly cooking shows. He quickly becomes computer-literate. Young adults latch onto him believing he's the joke du jour. Before you know it, Hitler's polemics have millions of social media hits.He becomes a regular contributor on a very popular TV show where his nationalist speech (more passionate and even tempered versus the wild-eyed rants of yore) strikes a chord. Honestly, those who are awake in contemporary society will find grains of truth in what this monster says.Then the Fuhrer writes a book that's the source for a film.This multifaceted film tackles a number of important issues: the permanence of racism and xenophobia, the danger of projecting darkness onto a manipulative figurehead (eerie in the Trump era), life in a dumbed-down world, lack of personal responsibility, and much more. It's also a history lesson presenting just how Hitler rose in the Thirties.The tone veers serious when the journalist learns, through viewing videotape, that this is no actor, this is The Hitler.

40,joncheskin,Devastating Time-Travel Satire,8,27 April 2016,"Look Who's Back is an amazing German movie that takes a rather old-fashioned science-fiction premise and gives it a new twist. A man from the past finds himself inexplicably transported to the present-day. The man turns out to be none other than Adolph Hitler, who, like anyone in such a situation, is dazed and confused and at first wondering what has happened. Even worse for him, he is transported in one of his old uniforms and at first finds himself wandering the streets of 2014 Berlin, with curious onlookers assuming that he is a kook worthy perhaps of a selfie shot from a cell phone. Hitler soon gets his bearings, however, and a fresh set of clothes, and befriends a television producer, who turns him into something of an internet sensation. The rest of the movie is a fascinating surmise of what Hitler might be in the present day.Look Who's Back is something of a cross-cultural comedy, like Malcolm McDowell's Time After Time, which also involved a celebrity time-traveler (HG Wells). We get to see him learn about modern things like TV, cooking shows, computers, and the internet, and we of course get to see what he might think of modern politics. He is often awkward in the modern world, so we get to laugh. But look out, this is Hitler, and he is the same super-self-possessed demon that we all know and dread. The character is 3D and drawn with amazing brilliance by Oliver Masucci. He starts doing what Hitler would do--talking to people, getting a sense of their anxieties and grievances, projecting a sense of earnestness and mission, and let's face it--charming the heck out of everyone around him as he goes on to become something of a media personality. Which is really what makes this movie so interesting. In the 1930s, Germany did not know what it was dealing with in Hitler, was fooled by his charms and facade. In 2014, no one believed that the new Hitler was real, but again everyone was duped by the facade--they all thought he was a comedian, until it turned out that he had an agenda. I found the the actions and demeanor of the character as drawn by the movie both convincing and fascinating. Watching people get suckered again in 2014 was a rather humbling experience. Look Who's Back is well worth your time--it is both entertaining and disturbing, a great character study and a convincing story.

Other times the film features Sacha Baron Cohen style man on the street segments relying on cringe humour.

Great job.,Look Who's Back
44,professorjeffreypbrown,Same drummer just a different beat,8,19 April 2016,"The film lives on the edges of comedy / dramatic commentary but handles the question of what would Hitler be like if he came back quite adroitly. As Hitler orients himself to 2014, he gets tuned into the pressing issues of the times. After Hitler gets up to speed at to what's transpired over the decades, he sees the new world no better than when he left it, all was for not. All he sees is a world full of foolishness, triviality, and perversion, and while being toted around as a freak show to be filmed, he campaigns the people for current problems and issues, finding his purpose again. But since this is a second go round, it's going to be a bit more of a challenge to work his way up the ranks to lead the German people again. And even though the people find him entertaining, even a bit frightening, they cannot tolerate the true Hitler when he shoots an innocent little dog. But this is the new world where even evil murderers are forgiven, and he gets back in the good graces of the people again. He even makes a movie, all the time using his world- dominance view to abhor and entertain. At the conclusion, we find Germany's current issues something Hitler can use to gain power again: the Muslim invasion. The moral of the story? There will always be people in dire need of a savior, and when the people are desperate they will almost always abandon common sense for a leader who, in the long run, is almost always more of a disaster than a cure.",Look Who's Back
45,faterson,The Art of Comedy: How to Be Supremely Funny & Deadly Serious at the Same Time,8,12 April 2016,"Making fun of Hitler has had a long tradition, dating back to when Hitler was alive, and one of the greatest comedies of all time, Charlie Chaplin's _The Great Dictator_. Indeed, Chaplin can be briefly glimpsed in _Look Who's Back_, along with other actors who portrayed or lampooned Hitler over the decades.Just like _The Great Dictator_ manages to be a thoroughly serious movie towards the very end and Chaplin's famous speech extolling democracy, _Look Who's Back_ also has a serious undertone beneath all the slapstick. It, therefore, meets the prime criterion for supreme comedy: that it should be very funny to watch (and you're likely to laugh out loud quite a few times) but simultaneously deadly serious in its message._Look Who's Back_, ingeniously, features not just a twist ending, but *two* twist endings, followed, quite a bit later, by the genuine ending. It is precisely during the two twist endings that the movie is the most serious. It probes the viewer's faith in democracy – is it a viable model for society at all? And, are human beings, at their core, good or bad? The answer is, of course, ""neither"", or ""both"". And that is exactly what the twist endings demonstrate: first, Hitler speaks so convincingly as to make even his most virulent opponents among the viewers admit that he has a point. It appears that evil has triumphed after all; or, is it human negligence and mental laziness and self-centeredness that allows voters to shrug their shoulders and, perhaps despite some inner misgivings, elect someone like Hitler to be their leader? In any case, Hitler affirms that he'd be back – not forcefully, but joyously welcomed by the people as their beloved leader.But wait! Florian the common man wants to have none of it. His repulsion against evil is too great, and after struggling mightily with himself, he shoots Hitler. It appears that the good has triumphed after all.But wait! There's another twist coming, and then yet another – the movie's true ending that, so to say, ""hangs in the balance"" and is neutral. It says that the time for Hitler's return in today's Europe, confused by the refugee crisis, is auspicious. It now depends on us, the viewers, whether we allow that to happen.The very last few moments in _Look Who's Back_ show some real-life newsreel footage of unrests during the refugee crisis (the movie was made in 2014 as opposed to the book that was released 3 years earlier when the refugee crisis wasn't a topic of discussion). I thought that the addition of this real-life footage was unnecessary, too ""propaganda-laden"", if you will (although well-meant), and I wish this would have been left out. One can too palpably feel that this was just ""slapped on"" to the finished movie as an afterthought, as a reaction to the refugee crisis in post-2014 Europe. The slapstick is great throughout, and some scenes are unforgettably hilarious, such as Hitler's secretary setting up an email account for him, but discovering that all of Hitler's preferred user names (including his own name) are already taken. Not only in moments like these, Oliver Masucci gives an excellent performance in the title role – understated in the proper moments, funny but nuanced.Generally, the actors' performances in _Look Who's Back_ are superb, and credit for guiding them so expertly must be given to the director David Wnendt. I was particularly impressed by Christoph Maria Herbst and Katja Riemann in the roles of dueling, high-powered media executives. The chilliness and ruthlessness exuded by their characters is almost palpable. Herbst is supposed to be a comedic actor primarily, but his character in _Look Who's Back_ is above all a dramatic figure, and Herbst's portrayal is spot-on. (In one of Herbst's funnier moments, _Look Who's Here_ features a meticulous recreation of the famous Bruno Ganz ""Hitler outburst"" scene from _Der Untergang_. There we have a cinematic sendup to complement all the countless YouTube subtitled mutations.) Among supporting actors in smaller but memorable roles, I was impressed by Thomas Thieme as the TV boss, and Gudrun Ritter as Grandma._Look Who's Back_ offers a great mixture of scripted dialogue and scenes and ""hidden camera"", Sacha Baron Cohen-like unscripted scenes. These are mixed so well that sometimes, you're not quite sure whether you're watching the former or the latter. See Hitler's visit of NPD headquarters, produced in the style of real-life documentaries, hand-held cameras and all.The satire in _Look Who's Back_ is biting: Hitler gets beat up by Neo-Nazis, because they assume he must be making fun of Hitler. And the German TV population, so apparently ready to embrace a second coming of Hitler, is only taken aback (temporarily?) when they see Hitler mistreating a little dog. Kindness towards fellow humans is perhaps not a given in Germany, but it's the German love of dogs that is truly unconditional.I haven't read the book yet, but it appears that the movie was suitably and in certain respects, significantly altered compared to the book, but with the best possible outcome. Depending on the credits source, up to 6 various writers may have worked on the screenplay, including the director Wnendt and the book writer Timur Vermes, and this carefulness has paid its dividends.",Look Who's Back
46,modernmonstersdotnet,Springtime For Hitler In Germany,7,21 September 2016,"""Even Poland still exists! This war has been useless!"" erupts Adolf Hitler not too long after the movie has started. This is one of the many instances one has to fight the urge to spit one's drink all over the place. A fish out of water if there was ever one, Look Who's Back puts an outrageous twist on the stuff of legend (Elvis not dead, neither Marylin, or MJ) and precipitates a resurrected Hitler in contemporary Germany. The Fürher still thinks he's on command; harsh reality quickly enlightens him: he is a laughing stock, with a future in stand up comic.This movie is way better that it should be, a miracle walk on a very, very tight rope. The first reason is of course the delightful performance of Oliver Masucci, unrecognisable behind his moustache. Compared to him, the rest of the cast is a bit run-of-the-mill, but most of the scenes involving public appearances have been improvised, and what the common German people have to say about a Hitler comeback is as hilarious as it is frightening.What could have been a series of vignettes à la Sacha Baron Cohen takes the trouble of developing a plot and various characters, to whom Hitler reacts with a mix of genuine passion for ""the German people"" and a sly denial of anything racist or xenophobic. He's the perfect politician, with an answer to any question and at least three escape routes planned for any quagmire.Carefully editing a mix of newsreel (the Angela Merkel cameo, gratified with ""the charisma of a cold noodle"", is priceless), movie references (the Leni Riefenstahl opening title, the now-iconic Bruno Ganz' bunker scene, except it's oh so cleverly attributed to the villain of the piece) and guerrilla-style impromptu meetings, Look Who's Back manages to balance serious issues (far too many to list) and fleeting fads shedding a cruel light on our social networking culture. From an online ""Adolf Hitler make- up tutorial"" to a ""I hate everyone but Hitler"" tweet and the demonstration that Facebook is useless at recruiting Hitler Jungen, naturally springs the conclusion – it shames one to write it – that ""no one ever stay mad at Hitler for very long"".Chaplin's The Great Dictator was a brave movie because it was fighting on the front of an ugly war. Look Who's Back adapts this sense of emergency and combativeness to our desperately stupid modern times. The worst thing Hitler can do is kill a puppy. Gasing whole families was ""all a joke"", as asserted by the latest generation of one of said families.What to think of the world we live in, the duty of memory, the atrocities that constellated the 20th century, when one pees itself watching the most reviled person in history punctuating his nazi salute by the phrase ""See you soon, Nigga""? If this blog has a meaning at all, it has found his first authentic modern monster. Bad news is it's a real one; good news is it's desperately funny.",Look Who's Back
47,mymtproject,"Entertaining, dark comedy with Hitler alive in the modern world",9,29 November 2016,"Not at all what I was expecting (not that I had a certain expectation), when I saw LOOK WHO'S BACK. This satirical German movie about Hitler waking up in 2014 Berlin and being ""discovered"" for a hip television show is actually very funny. The reason it's funny is because Hitler (a master at crowd manipulation in the 1930-40's) is able to use the new medium of the internet and popular culture to re-insert himself back into German society. No one initially recognizes that Hitler isn't an actor or street performer, but the genuine person of history. The reporter who first stumbled onto him eventually grasps this, however by then Hitler has successfully transitioned himself into the modern world and people find him entertaining, not threatening. The reporter's sudden warnings make the reporter look crazy, since there's no logical way Hitler could have time traveled from 1945 to 2014. In the end, Hitler is slowly rising in popularity again and the reporter is sent to an insane asylum. This movie deliciously shows how being ""plugged in"" to a world of information and yet being ignorant of history can allow evil a foothold, which is all it needs. The point of the movie is to laugh at Hitler, not with Hitler and yet, you find yourself being taken along for the ride, just like everyone else. It takes a manipulator but also a willing populace to be manipulated. This would be a great movie for sociology, psychology, mass media and philosophy students to watch. It has ramifications about the extent of our gullibility and culpability in the global information world. A very different kind of dark comedy for sure. This Hitler would be an internet star! Just think about it.",Look Who's Back
48,rolfesam,A Daring and Dark Comedy that makes Light of History's Worst Man,7,7 October 2017,"Look who's back is an entertaining dark Comedy that plays out the scenario of what if Hitler just came back in 2015? The answer that the film comes to is that he would simply be regarded as a comedian that is simply going for a shock value in his work, and the public just eats it up. This is where the social commentary of the modern day comes into effect and, with the hindsight of the last couple years comfortably behind us, turned out to be pretty much dead on with its assumptions of 21st century society as a whole. The idea that a person like Hitler would not only be considered popular and funny enough for people to go along with the gag until it is too late and they realize that the monster that they have fed and helped grow is now too big to kill is really almost prophetic now looking back on it in a post-nationalist movement USA and Europe. As a whole though, if you ignore the feeling like the point of the movie may have been rendered mute by society just 2 years after its release, you will have watched a very entertaining comedy about the worst human to ever be born. I really have to hand it Oliver Masucci for really taking a very difficult role in the role of Hitler himself, and making him simultaneously hilarious and terrifying as well as nearly making the monster that is Hitler likable. I wouldn't have believed that sentence unless I'd seen the movie but Masucci really does that good of a job in the movie. It's just a shame that the direction and pacing of this movie aren't worth Masucci's talent. The direction of this movie is all over the place and it can hit a lot of really funny, saddening, and scary moments but it fails to find a solid path to lead us from one scene to the other. instead of making a road that leads from scene to scene in a way that feels natural the pacing of this film feels more like each scene is a stepping stone in the middle of a stream and the audience is forced to awkwardly hop from one scene to the next with no set goal in its delivery other than to go from start to end. Overall the movie is worth your time, it makes a really solid point about how modern society seems more willing to accept people saying really horrible things so long as we assume them to be comical and like I said before Oliver Masucci really does some amazing stuff with his role in the movie.",Look Who's Back
49,jeanmichellavoie,fun and intelligent,7,26 April 2019,This is a fun film and it made me smile a couple of times.

50,Bigideas_Baggins,"""The book was better""",2,14 December 2020,"...and even the book was not that good, in my opinion. The issue for me is this: the summary is more interesting than the material itself. There is the premise, ""Hitler wakes up in modern day Germany"", and I'm like: well, that sounds interesting, you have my attention, what's next? The problem is that the answer in either case is not very satisfactory. However, at least in the book, Hitler delivers a social commentary by interpreting the current day world from his point of view, which is somewhat interesting, although it does get stale after a while.
The movie, however, at least the first half that I watched, foregoes this in lieu of presenting us with Borat like scenario's, as mentioned in other reviews. And (given the success of Borat itself, I guess the problem is with me), I just do not find this funny. And here's why: for example, let's look at the scene at the dry cleaner's. Hitler wants his uniform cleaned, and starts stripping in the store, down to taking off his underpants. Cut to close ups of the other people present (employees, customers) showing awkward or shocked reactions. Well, no really, what would you expect? But it has not much to do with Hitler. If I would walk in there with normal clothing and started stripping that way, do you think they'd be like: yeah, that's perfectly normal, we get that all the time here. In Dutch we have an accurate word for this: ""onderbroekenlol"" which translates as ""under pants humor"", but it basically means ""low brow comedy, often focused on nudity, breaking wind, etc."". And that is the level of humor in this movie, where, given the premise, it could be so much smarter. Like the scene with the dag (#Snatch): oh look, Hitler is attacked by a small dog in the background of someone talking about how he likes dogs, and ends up shooting the dog. First of all this is not the sort of comedy I find funny, but more important: again, like with the dry cleaner's, in a scene like this, how is it different that it's Hitler that this is happening to, compared to just an average person? It isn't really. Oh look, Hitler draws a generic looking caricature of someone, do you get it... well, he wanted to be a painter back in the beginning of the 20th century, funny right? And on and on this goes. And in scenes which are more connected with the fact that it is Hitler, it's still very surface level and predictable. Again: you confront a random afternoon shopper with suddenly pushing (someone looking like) Hitler in his or her face, of course you get awkward reactions, but try to imagine yourself in that situation. Would you have the quickness of mind to have a totally politically correct, well argumented rebuke in that situation, or could you be lured into saying something that can be used by the filmmakers in the context they want to present? If it's the former for you, don't worry, they will cut that out anyway.For me it is the missed potential than I find the most frustrating: you have a great premise, and you could do so many interesting things with it, and you end up doing the most predictable and boring slapstick like comedy. What a shame...",Look Who's Back
51,jmihalchik-67031,Brilliant Satire,8,7 January 2019,"The film is everything that an ironic comedy should be.
Perhaps the most unsettling element of the movie is the ""likeability"" of one of history's great monsters-- he is funny, insulting, and supremely confident while at the same time humble in his new surroundings.
The remaining characters are mere filler. An awkward romance between Hitler's ""bestie"" (free-lance journalist Zawatsk) and a Goth television secretary doesn't work.

53,knoxfan2008,A mediocre Borat/Bruno rip-off that doesn't understand the basics,2,8 May 2017,"Let me start by saying I haven't read the book, which from what I've heard is far more intelligent than this film. I'm also a liberal, therefore my criticisms of this film have nothing to do with it's targeting of conservatives, but of the film's misrepresentation of it's subjects and ineptitude in the film-making. I also am not a person who gets offended, I LOVE the concept and wish a better creative team had handled this idea.""Look Who's Back"" is clearly aping off the success of Sacha Baron Cohen's ""Borat"" and ""Bruno"", yet fails to realise what made those films great. 1st, the man who plays Hitler is mediocre, he is physically wrong for the part & not short as Hitler was, he towers over everyone else, which takes away completely from the comedy. He also lacks any improvisation skills, unlike Cohen, he never asks any challenging questions or manages to ""trap"" his victims, instead, the film heavily relies on cheap, dishonest editing.The editing is the worst aspect of the film. Not only is is poorly paced comedy- wise, but also dishonest and clearly misrepresents people interviewed. In his films, Cohen would stay with someone on screen for at least a minute, allow the viewers to become accustomed to them in unbroken, usually unedited takes, then Cohen would strike with a smart question perfectly tailored to that person. Here, interviewees are on screen for 10 seconds at the most, ensuring that all of their opinions are out of context. There is one man who literally says ""I'd be willing to take a bullet for my Germany"" and that's his only 3 seconds of screen time, because he is edited between 2 other people saying rather controversial things, the director is manipulating the viewers into concluding this man is a bigot, where he only said what anyone in the world would say about their country regardless of political persuasion. It's clear they had to resort to this choppy editing style due to none of their subjects were as horrible as they hoped; demonstrated by the montage, where we see snippets of dozens of improvised scenes, obviously not funny, that hit the cutting room floor.It's a tonally and stylistically confused mess. Whereas in the fore-mentioned films, the dramatised elements and mockumentary parts are interwoven perfectly. In ""Look Who's Back"", they constantly jump between styles, undermining our confidence in the realism of the supposed ""true"" moments.Because the leading role is a man playing Hitler, we can't trust answers given to him, as the vast majority of his subjects are being ironic as they give their answers, they're in on the joke, where Cohen's victims were not. There is a man early on who says that the solution to Germany's problem is ""Labor Camps"", which would be horrifying if there wasn't a probable chance he was taking the mickey, instead, he's on screen for 5 seconds, then never asked another question. There is nothing ""sobering"" or ""eye opening"" about anyone's opinion in this film, because everyone's opinion is tainted by the fact they are aware they are being interviewed by a comedian. The most egregious opinions are those of a few drunkards in a bar who are obviously playing up their ""devotion"" to ""Hitler"" as a joke, illustrated by the fact they are all laughing and taking photos of the actor, yet the film frames them as if they genuinely believe this. Also, every time they ask somebody about refugees, it frames every respondent that has a conflicting emotion towards the crisis as if they agree with a Hitler-Esque position. I hesitate to call any film morally reprehensible, but this film definitely rides that line in it's dishonestly and over-simplification.The non scripted scenes are the only ones that have an occasionally funny line, yet there's far too much, the side characters are dull, and it's unbelievable and contrived.The ending of the film is a ham-fisted ""twist"" where the message is crammed down our throats in the manner of a soap opera, as is most of the ""points"" the film is trying to make. The credits are particularly egregious, in suggesting Wilders and LePen are the modern equivalents to Hitler. While I dislike both those politicians, it is a reprehensible, simplistic and childish comparison from film-makers who are clearly virtue signaling. It's message is so melodramatic and self-important that it is unintentionally hilarious how pretentious it is.Tonally, ""look who's back"" doesn't know if it wants to be an edgy, a no holds barred offensive comedy, or a liberal think piece. It ends up as confused. I assume most of the positive reviews are from the kind of people who don't watch many foreign films, so whenever they see one, they praise it endlessly.P.S., the music in this film is all recycled from other better films (Dawn of the Dead) and uses THREE songs from A Clockwork Orange. Either use an original song, or use classical music that hasn't been so overplayed in the past. In so many respects, it feels like a film by a uni student.",Look Who's Back

You sure do laugh watching the movie but none of those laughs are pleasant laughs like watching any other comedy movie. They are all guilty pleasure laughs. Watching this movie, you are more than just the audience observing the events of this world from as a third party; you are more of a person in Germany witnessing the return of Hitler and watching the things unravel. That is your point of view in this movie. Think of yourself as a person in the audience laughing at Hitler as he is giving his performance because you are no different than them. You laugh at him even though you know what a terrible person he is. People at the audience also laugh at him so you are not alone but you know that he is being for real when he talks instead of being an extreme method-actor unlike the audience. I hate to say it but unfortunately that is how captivating he is. And this movie proves us that even though we knew what a terrible person Hitler is, I believe still most of us got captivated by him and you need to admit it. We are susceptible.

55,empty-bin,This isn't about Hitler...,8,31 May 2016,"...And that's why it was so scary.This is a thriller. The premise is Hitler has some how come through time and believes fate has brought him here to clean house (again). However, the film was actually using this metaphor to describe the coming of the next Führer if we're not careful. If we let down our guard we absolutely WILL see the rise of the next Adolf Hitler.The character of Hitler spoke the truth, mostly. His rhetoric cut to the heart of today's problems. It was a German production so, obviously, he spoke directly to German issues but again, Germany was just the stage and Hitler the puppet. The puppeteers were revealing a global truth wrapped in a local narrative.Recall the time Angela Merkel, today's German Chancellor, called G.W. Bush on 9/11 and the subsequent ""War on Terror"" saying something to the effect of, ""We've seen this before...!"" THIS is what the movie is getting at.This film is filled with amazing though often chilling street interviews featuring Hitler interrogating work-a-day people. Many of the younger of these people so open to the apparent humor or irony were embracing him, taking ""Hitler selfies"" - other older spectators and interviewees apparently LONGED for someone to take the reins and whip (Germany) into shape, getting rid of ""suspicious-looking, bearded Salafists"", etc. And these were not actors.

Inserting a short man with a short mustache, hair licked from the side and military uniform from Germany in the 1940s playing Führer himself in offices and on YouTube channels in the modern world, the comicisms for the time deviation just couldn't be greater than the criticisms that the unusual figure would attract and realize, being filmed in a mixture of scenarios set up for the script and a commentary tone with interviews on the streets today.Without being disrespectful to those persecuted by the dictator and his nation of lunatic supporters, ""He is back"" presents a narrative ranging from a growing and comical black humor caused by the insults to Hitler to the reflections on what the insults and antics have done by themselves they were, and still are, capable of doing.Not only impressed by the similar characterization and the great performance in the role of the German dictator by the actor Oliver Masucci, the film is able to surprise you with a progress that has been hinted at since the beginning of the story, taking the dictator to the same point that he would one day it arrived provoking and taking advantage of indoctrinated revolts and intolerance - exhibiting exactly the obvious that would happen if Hitler really came back to life.""You talk like him"". In parallel with what happened to Hitler in history, with the presentation of his appearance, his fame, his exile and his unfortunate triumphant return, the satirical work proves, unfortunately, that all the blind ideals that caused the darkest period in history modernism remain present and sympathizers hidden in the real world, just waiting for the speeches, stimuli and leadership that will lead them on the path of ignorance and indifference that soon turns into protests, uniformed marches, fanatical greetings and violence against other human beings who they are then lowered from that level, repeating history that should never have been repeated and never even happened.It's scary how reality looks like a work of fiction.",Look Who's Back

61,angel-youles,A clever and an entertaining film with a great message,9,29 April 2016,"Look Who's Back follows Adolf Hitler who reawakens in Germany 70 years after his death. When reading this film's synopsis, I thought it was a very funny concept, that Hitler reawakens and becomes a popular comedian. I thought it was going to be a silly satire, but to my surprise it has a very deep message interwoven with a great use of comedy.The film follows the protagonist Benimmcoach who in attempt to save his career in the media industry, finds a man in the back of one of his videos, who he thinks looks amusingly similar to Adolf Hitler, unaware that is actually Hitler. He mistakes him for a brilliant comedian who never wants break his character. He convinces his boss to give Hitler a show,this is where things start to get interesting.During Benimcoach's and Hitlers travels, Hitler notices the dissatisfaction of the German people, and notices that their views and perceptions are not so different from his. They express dismay about the flood of immigrants coming to Germany, it is here that Hitler reassures them ""We'll make Germany strong again."" This combined with his old fashioned national socialist attitudes and comical remarks earns him a fan-base of millions of people, albeit there are some who find the idea of using ""Hitler"" for comedy appalling and a distressing reminder of the time.Benimmcoach develops an odd friendship with Hitler, interestingly Hitler in the film is portrayed as not a bad guy, in fact, he is shown to be good, he feels strongly about helping people, including Benimmcoach. The film oddly makes you root for him and he becomes a likable character instead of the horrid villain which films usually portray, then the film reminds you just how cruel and destructive his ideals can be. The film situates you in the place of the German people in the film, you like the character Hitler, for his comedy and his determination to help people, yet you and they are thrown back into the reality of the situation, for instance, When we witness his acts of cruelty, much like the audience of the show in the film witnesses him shooting a beloved dog because it annoyed him.Once Benimmcoach finds out that it is not someone acting as Hitler, he really is Hitler, he attempts to get rid of him by shooting him in the chest, to Benimmcoach's surprise, Hitler reappears and says to him ""You can't get rid of me, because I am in all of you."" This is the moment of revelation of a deep and complex message. Hitler isn't portrayed as a vile monster because in fact he isn't, he is like everyone else. In fact it comments on his ideology being at the core of what made the man evil and destructive; this idea is emphasized at the end, where it shows archive footage of countries all other Europe, preaching hatred of Immigrants. The film's message is a powerful critique of our values, it is basically telling us that we need to reevaluate our actions. It proposes that questions ""Did Hitler really leave?"" and ""have times changed much since? Maybe the man is gone, but the ideology lives on through us.This film is both clever and entertaining, I would recommend it to everyone, it is does what a film essentially should do, provoke thought about our lives and entertain :)",Look Who's Back
62,maarten_50,"I laughed out loud, however...",6,3 April 2016,"The major part of this German film is fun Borat-style comedy. Another part is melodrama, clearly to avoid the 'neonazi-stamp' by the press. And a final part is just plain old political recuperation which rendered my rating 8/10 to a 6/10. It is highly ironic that a film, which spends a fair amount of time carefully showing the danger of fascism with comedy, explicitly revolts against those people who stand up to the newest totalitarian threat: the threat of Islam.This makes this film like what a previous reviewer stated: indeed, a film for cowards. However, don't let that put you off. Measuring this film's value by the amounts of laughs it provokes, it clearly succeeds. I had trouble withholding my laughter as the rest of my family slept.

While this message is not quite on the mark as the humour, it still left a strong impression on me.Oliver Masucci is the star of the show - of course. He's both unsettling and hilarious as Hitler. There are several well-crafted scenes where his likeness to Hitler is disturbing. The director plays this likeness up to great effect. But other scenes are as funny as you'd expect. Hitler getting his photo with Chinese tourists. Hitler trying to work out how to use a computer. Hitler getting beaten up by neo-Nazis.The concept of this movie strongly appealed to me, and it did not disappoint. But it actually went beyond what I expected to deliver a serious message: Hitler did not trick people with propaganda -- he was voted in. He tapped into deeply held and often ugly beliefs and twisted them to his own ends. This is a timely message too, with the rise of Donald Trump in the US.",Look Who's Back

66,bungulahouwagadou,Painfully bad novel adaptation,2,4 August 2019,"""Look who's back"" turned out to be a fine novel maybe lacking some in-depth knowledge about Hitler, yet a very interesting idea to portray current Germany through Hitler's eyes in this satire.The movie, however, fails in adapting the novel adequately. In addition to that, literally every change is bad. One of the emberassing highlights is a scene that parodies (or so?) a famous scene from ""Downfall"". Its humor fails completely to be funny, and unwillingly funny are the ""dramatic"" scenes.
An interesting part is there, however, when we get to see documented scenes of Hitler meeting with people from all over the country.In conclusion, if you're interesting in this topic, I recommend rather reading the novel.

However even with a Lefty mindset framing the intended plot/message of this film I still found it to be superb for a couple reasons:1) The film production, story, writing, direction, acting, casting, wardrobe and music... all were fantastic and truly shows modern film what real movies as works of art/entertainment could/SHOULD be. Whatever political mindsets the creators of this film have personally you can tell they all were dedicated to making a quality movie here. 2) This was one of if not THE mos honest portrayals of Adoft Hilter I've ever seen in a mainstream film (even if they were making fun of him a lot of the time). The writers did of course add some of the cliche exagerations and myths about him to make sure we never forgot he was 100% evil and had zero valid points or perspectives and no one should ever for a split second question what they told us in the history books ... but even with those in there it was refreshing (and mesmerizing) to see the man portrayed with the least amount of historical bias (lies) as most all stories of him are normally surrounded with (bad grammar there but you get my gist).One other thing I enjoyed was that this was a German language movie.

The funny bits were genuinely funny, causing me to roar with laugher. However, the films real strength rests in how it portrays the gullibility of people, their desire to follow a leader, whilst suspending a degree of their humanity to get on in life. There is a great homage to ""Downfall"" with a replica scene of when Hitler finds out his armies are defeated and Berlin is about to fall. The most chilling scene is at the end. I won't spoil it, except to say it touches deep into the psyche of the German people, exposing a raw nerve that must hurt to this day.

The film is full of nationalist discrimination and prejudice. It is ruthlessly exposed and licked the scars of history, mocking this bad history, but the purpose is to express the concerns and concerns about the current situation of the people in the country. The whole film says that Hitler needs the people. And the ending point is exactly what the people need Hitler. He is just a genius born from the needs of the people. He is full of vision and highly provocative. Regardless of ancient and modern times, he is just a miniature of the hearts of millions of people. The history is right and wrong, but it is always a fault Do contemporary people need to be vigilant? In general, the irony of the perfect score is perfect. If Hitler's first half of the plot can clearly express Hitler's personal characteristics, it is even better.

76,apolysus,Scarry to see that this is possible in the streets of Berlin.,5,21 May 2020,"Understanding that this is a book adaptation, it was a really good choice to use some kind of hidden camera element like we see in the films with actor Sacha Baron Cohen, to accentuate the theme of this satire film. That said, the film will take more liberties and differ from the book, resulting in a less superior story.The reaction of the the public was the most interesting part of the movie. I was honestly quite shocked to find out how easy-going people were after seeing something that, for what I understood, holds a great stigma in Germany. It was scary to see people level with Adolf as they talked about the status quo and started agreeing on very strong and often very right statements. The kind of statements that are shortsighted and have no complex context, but sound empowering by promising prosperity. It's clear that this can mirror how the real Hitler, or other politicians, use these signs of discontent from the people in order to push their own agenda.Another topic that I find, and this may me more subjective, is the debate on weather or not we should keep certain things a taboo. A lot of people threw a quirky smile, or rose their hand as got a picture with this ""comedian"". Most of these people may not identify with the ideologies that Hitler represents but merely act along with the joke. Still I think it's fair to say that this behavior is what develops the story. By doing so they gradually lift the veil of this stigma and give it a platform. Kind of like the book and movie ""The Welle"". A story about a similar social experiment where the kids are just joking around, but eventually get caught up in it all.Sadly, though there is a lot to think about, I do not feel as though most of that is credited to the movie itself, it lacks clever writing or strongly researched philosophies. instead it is rather on the nose and weaves a silly story through it all that I just couldn't get into. Everything felt a bit childish. Even Hitler himself was not really that spot on (unlike the claim of most other reviewers). I thought be was kind of immature, shortsighted and often straight up dumb. Like when he broke the car lamp and tried to put the broken glass back into the lamp.Wile writing this review I was reminded of one of the characters in the media team, who said something about reviewers that will often rate satire higher in order to not look stupid. So do with that what you will. I get the picture, I just feel as though the movie itself wasn't as strong.(+) Social experiments and ideas that are thought provoking.

Oliver Masucci is a dark-funny, clownish Hitler that could have suffered more from jet-lag than presented but the voice, mimics come across convincing. The story is original but dries up earlier than the end of the movie. With any other historic character, it would have been awkward but with magnitude of evil as Hitler, there is enough to make it last a little longer. Satire (Christoph Herbst acts sublime in reference to a scene in Der Untergang), confronting, warning.. sure. Until the last 5 minutes of the movie where director David Wnendt suddenly wants to underline a certain lesson by showing actual examples of extreme right political leaders, movements. He subjectivizes and limits the value of the movie. As Masucci says just before the end that any chosen dictator/extremist is only the reflection of (silent) feelings of the masses, the essence of the story is applicable to most of the mono-theological religions, or ANY movement that wants to dictate its ideas.

82,Dan_323,A Film Immensely Relevant To Our Times,9,25 April 2016,"Ist Er Wieder Da (Look Who's Back) is a highly enlightening film based on the premise on what would happen if Hitler literally came back. Under the guise of a comedy, it illuminates the human condition - how in times of political and societal ills and ultimately in crisis, people are radicalized beyond good reason and look for a man to vent their internalized frustrations. You c_unts have allowed yourselves to be brainwashed into thinking Hitler was pure evil, eating up the Western propaganda without questioning it. I roll my eyes every time. But really, are you so different from him? In the film, Hitler says how ordinary people elected an extraordinary man to lead them. But yet still a man. (The elected part is complicated though as Hiter was actually appointed Chancellor because he had a third of the seats in the Reichstag and his influence was undeniable.) That in their very core, they were all like him. Inevitably, a part of them. And indeed, Hitler is only second to Jesus Christ in terms of his immense influence yet only having lived so recently. He is a part of us all. So are you really as good as you think you are? That deep inside - not even really that deep - you do not have natural, primal prejudices? Do the people really know what is good for themselves? In reality, people have an inevitable tendency to look for a strong man to lead them in times of strife and confusion despite the consequences. Because we do not like to make hard decisions so we let someone else do it. This film is immensely relevant to our times for yet again history is repeating itself. Europe is gradually being radicalized due to their xenophobia of immigrants which they will adamantly and hypocritically deny but it is obvious. In fact, I asked an irritatingly arrogant teacher about the possibility of Europe being governed by radicals again and surprisingly being a learned historian of sorts, he said it was not possible. That they had ""learned their lesson."" Indeed, he forgot the central tenet of history of the fact that history always repeats itself. It is arrogant to dismiss the possibility for just look at our times.The US and not so surprisingly the Philippines - despite having just so recently toppled a dictatorship - are being attracted to strongmen - one of whose candidates is the very SON of that dictator - that vent out the people's polarization because DEMOCRACY DOES NOT WORK as well as you have been deludingly been led to believe. But as the saying goes, ""do not forget history lest you repeat it."" But yet it is still so easy to forget. In fact, however, all so-called democratic elections are manipulated. Little men are not in charge of their destinies as the big men have led them to believe to control them.

It makes you laugh because they portrait Hitler, suddenly being among modern day people with an wide spoken political opinion. The way I see it, this type of humor is not dark, because it creates awkward and very funny scenes with Hitler used to his way of life. ""Ah, ist das die fernsehe! Geeignet für Propaganda! Geubels mussen das sehen!"" (Ah, Thats the television of 2014, very fit for propaganda! Geubels should see this) (Entschuldigung for my bad English and Deutsch).2. The former unknown actor has phenomenal acting skills. He is the Jamie Vardy of the German movie industry. Outstanding performance, because I did not think anyone could portrait Hitler this hilarious and some kind of real.3. The movie gets you thinking about Hitler's political view being all around and inside us in present society. The Hitler personage really did create some weird sympathy now and then during the film. He actually has a message hidden behind his talking about war, invading Poland and how The Ottoman Empire (Turkey) took over Berlin. Believe it or not, but Hitler must have had charming skills, because millions of people loved him 80 years ago. How easily human minds can be kept away from his INSANE point of view. The movie shows people can be mislead by charm, pity, lending a hand, making a compliment etc. My 'weakness' is obviously laughter...What amazed me the most about this movie was that Hitler himself holds you and the people in the movie a mirror. Hitler of course wants Judenferfolgung and does not understand why we are living amongst different human races in 1 country. But the message underneath lets you think about the current social and political situation in Europe and the rest of the world.

But this movie made me think twice, so I thought I'd share my thoughts with you. Please don't be too harsh on me about mistakes in my English, my mother tongue is Dutch, so I am bound to make mistakes. As I said, I am Dutch; that makes me a neighbour of Germany, my parents grew up during the second WW, the school system educates us inside out about the war(s) and we learn German in school. So I have knowledge about Hitler, the way he rose to power, his gruesome deeds, his mistakes, also his successes, and his downfall. I was eagerly anticipating this movie, I had seen the trailers and they made me chuckle. Yet, I was very curious how the director was going to portray this character as ""funny"", since the trailers were portraying this movie as some sort of a comedy. In my opinion, Hitler is far from funny, yet I did smile during the trailers, which didn't really make me like myself. I had to see this movie. Fortunately it played in our local cinema, so I went, on a rainy afternoon. There were three other people there, one of whom was an elderly lady (with her grandson), discussing loudly how ""they were going to make it credible how Hitler got back to present day"". That was not my worry As far as I could judge (and please don't slay me on this, I'm not an experienced movie critic) the movie made clever use of actors, as well as regular people, bystanders, whose reactions were filmed documentary wise while meeting ""Hitler"" (in SS uniform, a very good likeness, although in my opinion the actor was quite tall, whereas the real Hitler was quite short). My initial emotions during the beginning of this movie, were confusing to me. I had some good laughs, and I even felt sympathetic to the way he was portrayed. I couldn't help myself. I didn't want to feel sympathy for him or laugh about his silliness, yet I did. The beginning of the movie was humorous, yet as it progressed, it got more and more grim. And it was not because of the actors or the things happening in the movie, it was because of the reactions of REAL people to ""Hitler"". I could not believe my eyes and ears. And without getting too much into detail and thereby spoiling a lot of content, ""Hitler"" goes on a road trip through Germany and talks to real people. Their reactions made me cringe. But the director cleverly changes from scene to scene and the ""bad things"" tend to be forgotten soon enough, when funny things happen again. This also made me think, after the movie was done. All in all, the viewer will undoubtedly feel sympathetic towards Hitler. And then suddenly, 3/4th into the movie, there is a grim and sudden turning point, which leaves you in awe, and makes you THINK and gives you a bolt of reality. **SPOILER** Hitler is introduced to an elderly demented Jewish woman, yet the audience does not know she is Jewish, she is catatonic and does not react to anybody, including her family, yet when Hitler steps into the house and starts to speak, her head lifts, her eyes open wide and she starts to scream. This scene gave me goose bumps. While everybody tried to calm her down and said things like ""he is not real"", ""it's just for fun"", she exclaimed things like: ""that's what everybody thought about him decades ago, yet he was not funny, or sympathetic, he was a beast of a man and murdered out my entire family"", well you get the drift. I was shaken about this scene, because she was so right and I felt like I was put in my place! From here on, the movie takes a different course and all is not so funny anymore, but a tad grim. Yet, the director preserves humour by showing how real people react when they get confronted with ""Hitler"". You feel like a voyeur, and you feel substitute shame, which is all too real, cause these people are real! Toward the end there was another scene which made me think twice. **SPOILER** ""Hitler"" is filmed when somebody confronts him who found out that ""Hitler"" is not a clever fraud but real, and this persons wants ""Hitler"" to jump off a building, which eventually happens. When the confronter looks over the edge, ""Hitler"" is nowhere to be seen, but when he turns around, there ""Hitler"" is again, and he speaks, saying something like he cannot be killed, because he is a part of all Germans, part of their common history, and he cannot be erased from that. This made me sit upright again. Cause there's so much truth in it! I've had German friends, who had a huge love for Scotland. They went there every spare moment. I asked them once: ""Why don't you ever speak about Germany? Or go on holiday there? Your country is really beautiful"". They explained that they somehow felt this was not a right thing to do, because of Germany's burdened past. They could never say things like ""we are proud of Germany"", because it would immediately be associated with Germany's Nazi history. That's why they concentrated on other countries than their own. They underwent their Nazi past as a burden. I felt bad about this but I also had to acknowledge there must be truth in how my friends felt. My conclusion about this movie is, that I was ready to be entertained by it, yet I was left thinking twice about its message, and still thinking about it. The movie is never boring, the acting is very good and the characters very credible. There is a sublime mixture between humour and seriousness and plain ""wow""-moment, I can't explain. But the best thing about this movie is, that it is contemporary and it really makes you think twice.",Look Who's Back
101,szlagy1,A racist movie about the Germans,1,23 January 2017,"Although I wanted to write a long description about this movie, I felt that it not deserves any description but this: The directors of this movie want convince the Germans once again that they are the most racist people on the planet, they are guilty of everything, and because of this they are not allowed to think about anything which happens around them. The only message of this movie is: Hitler lies in all of Germans like the seeds of the Devil, making them all a nation of evil. This is not different from the Nazi propaganda that the Jews are all parasites, who want to take over the world. It surprises me that those who think about themselves that they are democrats, anti racists and antifascists, hating all things related to these, like the producers of this movie, as I obviously understood after watching this film, do not notice that they are doing the same thing, what the Nazi propaganda had done against the Jews, Romanis and other minorities. But this time, they do it against the Germans, and this seems to be very OK, very PC for them! Watching this movie it is hard not to feel that some conspiracy theories are not conspiracy theories at all...

It was even more exhilarating reading the critics, e.g. ""how are we supposed to know that the old woman suffering from dementia is Jewish?"" : while moving the camera around her place one could see a Menorah, etc. Duh! On the whole the saddest part is that the humour targets a very ignorant population. Showing Hitler as cruel to a small dog is irretrievably stupid: the Nazis were the first to forbid vivisection, introduce efficient laws against cruelty to animals, hunting, and Hitler just loved animals, he was a vegetarian.

In this regard it is absolutely hilarious, and incorporates random, unscripted segments of Hitler talking to actual German citizens about the problems that they see in their day to day lives.It moves slowly at first, and eventually moves beyond a comedy to a dark story about Hitler rising once again to power, largely in part to how perverted and profit-driven the media company that he becomes associated with works. He makes money, and people like hearing what he has to say, because they believe he is a comedian poking fun at Nazi Germany. As it progresses, we see his true colors, but he has too powerful of a following, similar to how he rose to power back in the 30s. The people who realize what is happening are powerless to stop him, and are removed from the picture. It stops being a comedy, and we, just like those in the film, realize too late what is happening.It draws eerie parallels to our modern world, and provides a stark warning and comparison to the current nationalism that we have been seeing in modern days.

The turn of the movie is subtle and fascinating. You only notice it after it has already happened, which to me reflects the real way this would occur. It even happens that at some point the audience questions its own laughter. This movie is fun to experience, but also confronting in the upcoming changes in political landscape.

It looks like the inspiration of filmmakers vanished; big names no longer are a warranty for well spent time. I took my chance with ""Look who's back"" for the simple fact that I'm a natural born German, now living my dream in the USA. Not a single time did I feel the need of hitting FF. I was not even looking for any sort of entertainment; I wanted to see what the line is, the German filmmaker took and if there is a stronger message behind a funny story. There is a German saying which can apply even in this case and it can be applied in various situations; Beethoven is supposed to ""turn in his grave"" listening to today's music and in this case ""Hitler is turning in his grave"" watching what Germany became While not a fan of his ""work"", this movie is a statement that things are done THE WRONG WAY by today's leadership in Germany. One of the reasons I decided to move was me being tired to watch, not being able to change anything, how the country becomes more and more socialist with every day passing. If I can't change things in my country, I can definitely do changes with my own life and I did. The movie is a strong statement of the average German; the one no one listens to. Life in Germany has changed for the worse. First step was in '90 and from there on things are going only down Giving up the national currency, the beloved Deutsche Mark for an artificially created currency called Euro was a second major step toward misery. Back in the day, people used to LIVE, now people SURVIVE; that's the uncovered truth. Many things put in the mouth of the Hitler character are more actual today than ever, starting with all the crap on TV and ending with the out of context dog shooting; just like in real life things are taken out of context to serve a certain purpose. One line gave me goosebumps; when new Hitler says: ""If you blame me, you will have to blame all those who elected me"" Back to our days; we elect based on what? On the fact that grandpa was a democrat or a republican, based on a professor's progressive or conservationist view, he teaches in class, based on debates seen on TV, based on cuts out of context of the actual happenings, based on what local leaders say is ""good for the people"", based on religious beliefs which have no place in government since the freedom of belief is granted by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights?

110,ameliacolb,A silly satire with a serious edge and compelling critique of humanity,7,30 November 2016,"""Look Who's Back"" is a film that follows the resurrection of Hitler in modern day Germany. Through the use of satire, the film shows how Hitler becomes acquainted to the modern world, and follows his rise to fame after being discovered by a filmmaker who mistakes him as a comedy act. As ridiculous as this concept sounds, I found this film to not only be immensely entertaining, but also successful in conveying a greater message regarding our society. The film starts out fairly lighthearted, featuring comedic scenes as Hitler interacts with people of the public. Initially, I found it quite uncomfortable to watch, since morally it seemed wrong to laugh at Hitler and his ideas. Regardless, the absurdity of some of the scenes was so funny that I couldn't help but immerse myself in the comedy, and not focus on the controversy behind it. It is clear that the offensive jokes are meant to be purely satirical and not taken seriously (however if you are easily offended by this subject matter, this film may not be for you). As the film progresses, however, this tone quickly changes as the focus shifts onto bigger issues making the viewer once again question their own laughter. The satirical tone is maintained for most of the film, but starts to fade as Hitler gains more power towards the end of the film. By using the public's comical view of him to his advantage, Hitler gains huge popularity on television and the media, which forms a platform allowing him to express his ideas to a larger population. The gullible consumers soon begin to view Hitler's points as more than just a comedy act, which leads them to adjust their mindsets to fit Hitler's radical political beliefs. At this point, the viewer is raised to question the influence media has on the public eye. Exposure of the wrong figures can lead consumers to the wrong ideas, as media nowadays has the potential to reach a wide range of invested people. As the social commentary starts to unfold throughout the film, it becomes clear that the purpose of the film is not just to create a humorous caricature of Hitler, but to rather use him as a tool of controversy and a representation of power gained at the hands of media influence. This also leads viewers to question the values of society today. As displayed and mocked in the film, controversial content gains the most attention, and broadcasting platforms such as television or news channels will go to great lengths to gain this attention to maximize profit. Because of the massive influence media has on society today, where should the line be drawn when it comes to what is publicly broadcasted? This is another question fostered from this thought-provoking film.From a cinematic standpoint, I think the movie is very well done, especially in terms of the acting and filming. Hitler's character, though exaggerated, is realistically portrayed in his imposing attitude towards others and confusion/disorientation in the time period. Additionally, the makeup and costumes make the film more believable. When it comes to the cinematography, I think that the variety of filming techniques implicated greatly enhance the film. I think it is interesting how the camera angles shift from looking down on Hitler at the beginning of the film to looking up at him at the end, which could signify Hitler's gradual rise to power. My only critique of the movie is that it is sometimes awkwardly paced and becomes confusing towards the end.In conclusion, ""Look Who's Back"" is a very unique film, tackling deep issues and social/political commentary amidst an air of satire and comedy. I would definitely recommend it for its original plot and compelling critique on human nature. As long as you keep an open mind about the controversial topics mentioned, this film is definitely worth your time.",Look Who's Back
111,macenlang,Horribly Crude movie with difficult concepts to watch,4,4 January 2017,"""Look who's back is a satirical comedy about Hitler waking up in modern day Germany around 70 years after his suicide. Once Hitler wakes up he immediately goes back to seeking power, though now he uses the media to do this instead of the government. I found this film incredibly hard to watch as Hitler was a horrible man and seeing him rise to power again made my very uncomfortable. The film starts out with Hitler interacting with regular people on the streets of Germany. Most people laugh, point and try to get pictures but some are very offended by him. Hitler works his magic with a man named Sawatski by going on talk shows and comedy shows and being himself completely. The public is under the assumption he is just a Hitler impersonator and they get a good kick out of watching him. The movie is very controversial as Hitler is one of the most hated men that's ever lived and by creating a movie about him it gives him more of a platform, whether it be good or bad. The movie keeps a light hearted tone though most of it until about the last thirty minutes. It turns dark very quickly. Sawatski finally figures out that Hitler is not an impersonator and that is is the real Hitler resurrected. He eventually gets put into a psych ward because people think he is crazy thinking what he does. But think about it, what would you do in Sawatski's shoes. You would probably go crazy as well. Looking at this movie cinematically it was done phenomenally! The camera angles were used in a way that really caused you to engage in the movie especially when they made it seem like you were looking at Germany through Hitler's eyes. The characters they cast to act in the movie were very convincing, especially Hilter's character. The only part I really liked about this movie was the cinematic sections. I disliked the concept and every action that Hitler made was cringe worthy and against the normal values I have (like him shooting a puppy). Overall ""Look Who's Back"" is not a movie for people that are really against Hitler's regime and who is was as it makes a comedy out of him coming back from the dead and rising to power for the second time.",Look Who's Back
112,rorygilliland,A Skillful Mix of Comedy and Satire,8,25 November 2016,"Er ist wieder da stakes it's popularity on a delicate and controversial balance between societal criticism and comedy. The fact that the movie has Adolf Hitler in it is really unimportant to the actual purpose of the film; the Nazi megalomaniac widely blamed for the infamous genocide in the 1930s and 40s, while difficult to comprehend, simply acts as a conduit for the movie's satirical message. I believe this movie very skillfully uses Hitler not only to enhance the movie's satirical social commentary, but also to enhance the movie's controversiality, and therefore intrigue. What better way to spread word of one's movie than by harnessing the infamy of, and the outrage caused by, a man like Hitler? The film begins with a lighthearted tone: Hitler awakens mysteriously in the middle of Berlin, and begins exploring modern-day Germany, understandably bewildered by the advancements in technology and the state of society. He is received by others not to be the real Hitler, simply a satirical impressionist gaining attention. This sets the scene for some more humorous moments, in Hitler's serious interaction with those not taking him seriously at all. Later, through his newly-made connections with the media, Hitler airs on live television shows, and he speaks about his views of what has happened to Germany. Again, he speaks seriously, but is not taken seriously (at first). Throughout this section of the movie, many scenes portray reactions of real people in Germany reacting to Hitler, a testament to the movie's criticism of humanity's willingness to laugh at something as terrible as the idea of Hitler. The movie also uses interviews of real people by Hitler to illustrate another satirical point, people in a democracy have the power to change what they see as unjust, yet they choose not to. Also, a third satirical perspective is shown in the TV show director pushing the show's panelists to include very offensive jokes about Hitler and the genocide he caused. The movie points out the skewed views of the media as to what is acceptable to show on TV, all the while maintaining a skillfully comedic tone. The film becomes progressively more grim following this. Hitler gains popularity and eventually takes off on media, shown on TV shows and discussed on social media networks. Slowly, though, people begin to see that the points Hitler is making about society are valid, and Hitler's words reach the minds of the people of Germany, building support for a more radical political belief, with a Hitler imposter at it's head. More publicity is made of Hitler on TV, and he writes a book that becomes a top seller. It is adapted into a movie, and during production, an alarming realization is made by the producer, concerning the Hitler ""impressionist"". Throughout the latter part of the movie, the satire ramps up, and the comedy slowly fades away as the viewer is presented with some very thought-provoking ideas. It raises the issue of how much power the media has in determining how much viewers are exposed to certain people. In the movie, Hitler uses this flaw in the media to raise himself to power, by putting himself in the forefront of people's minds. The greatest satirical point which is raised in the film is on humanity: people are racist, people are nationalist, and at their core, everyone is like Hitler, and it is for this reason that Hitler receives such a large following. He points out the flaws in society, people agree with him, and he shows them another path, utilizing the media to raise public awareness of his movement, quite similar to how he rose to power in the 1930s. This is satirical of humanity's proclivity to shocking and controversial people or events, and their unquestioning loyalty to those people. The grimness of the movie truly comes full circle in the final scene, where one can see real German people reacting to Hitler being driven around the country, waving and saluting. Actual German people laugh at this spectacle, and even salute back, driving home the critical point the movie is trying to make, that the satire is not just about people in a movie, but people in real life.In terms of cinematography, the film does some interesting things. It makes great use of different camera angles, many point of view shots are taken to show Hitler's reactions to modern Germany. In addition, bird's eye views are used at the beginning to give the viewer a sense of setting. A frequent technique is using an interview setup in situations where real people are being exposed to Hitler. As well, the general camera angle throughout the movie seems to shift lower with reference to Hitler, portraying him as larger as the movie progresses, surely symbolic of his rise to popularity and power. Overall, this was a well-made film, and raises some very thought-provoking questions about humanity and it's values, while maintaining a (questionable, perhaps) comedic tone. The use of Hitler to convey the movie's point, I believe, strengthens the point. The use of a historical figure less infamous and timely would not have been so effective. Therefore, if you find the subject of Hitler and the ideas and events surrounding him to offend you, this is not the movie for you. As well, if you seek a purely comedic movie, I would recommend looking elsewhere, for comedic tone is replaced by a more grim tone later in the movie, which will leave you not laughing, but staring at your screen in disbelieving silence.",Look Who's Back
113,fynndude,"Look Who's Back, A Satirical Comedy; My Thoughts",8,26 November 2016,"The satirical comedy Look Who's back is set in modern day Berlin and sees a reincarnated Hitler attempt to live his life in Germany circa 2014. He meets a videographer who mistakes him for a very realistic Hitler impersonator and asks him to be part of a documentary regarding animals but when things go south, the two pivot to making a documentary about modern day political issues in Germany. From this consensus, the two men travel around Germany asking numerous German citizens (who may be, in fact, actual German people who share their opinions) about a variety of political issues such as the refugee crisis in Europe. I found that the quality of the movie, from the cinematography to the acting was strong. Look Who's Back is certainly a high quality film worthy of the big screen. Furthermore, Oliver Masucci, the brave actor who played Adolf Hitler, was sensational. His rendition of the Fuhrer was, at least in my eyes, spot on and his movements, language and posture approaching identical to that of the German dictator. Though the special effects in the movie were minimal, the ones that were included were certainly a positive addition and were high quality. The cinematography was strong and I found the use of a variety of different camera angles refreshing. On the other hand the movie was not perfect. Look Who's Back didn't have any moments that I found to be absolutely terrible. In fact there weren't any scenes that I thought the movie could do without. My only major comments would be that some of the scenes were more uncomfortable than entertaining. One such instances was when the ""Whoa Dude"" television show's writers were tasked with writing and sharing anti- Semitism jokes. I found this scene to be uncomfortable simply because, in my opinion, it is too soon for that kind of humor to be published publicly. Another point is the movie's explicit focus on the political situation in Germany to produce the majority of the funny moments. Granted the film did have some casual humor, for example Hitler's difficulty understanding a computer, that lightened the mood when it needed to be lightened and provided universal enjoyment. Finally, I found Hitler's interaction with modern day technology to be lacking despite his comments regarding televisions and various forms of transport. All in all, if the writers had added in a scene with Hitler trying to drive a car or Hitler trying to use a phone I feel as though it would have greatly benefited the film and added to its existing comic relief. To conclude, any form of media regarding Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party, whether it be for entertainment or informative purposes, is a slippery slope and getting it wrong could have significant morale repercussions. That being said, a movie about Adolf Hitler, if a director is willing to take the risk, is powerful and provides countless opportunities to comment on today's world. Look Who's Back is one such movie that walks a fine line between impactful storytelling and public scrutiny. This being said, I personally feel that Look Who's Back successfully incorporates enjoyable, laugh out loud humor into an impactful, eye opening story that, by the time its finished, leaves viewers pondering current political situations. In conclusion, if you are willing to stretch your tolerance and keep an open mind, Look Who's Back provides a jocose, provocative, and unpredictable experience worthy of any movie lover's time.",Look Who's Back
114,matin-nejad_tara,Uncomfortably Entertaining,7,27 November 2016,"The movie Look Who's Back features Hitler waking up in the middle of modern-day Berlin. It follows Hitler through his journey of seeing the modernization that took place in Berlin after World War 2, where he had died in the Führerbunker. At the beginning of the movie, it is slightly more light hearted and humorous compared to the ending of the movie, which is much different. The movie effectively uses satire to show that the movie is not to be taken in a offensive manner, but rather to be taken as something to think about the world and political views. Past the humour of the movie, it is obvious that the movie is not necessarily about Hitler, but rather the effect that one person may have by being persuasive. The movie aims to show the power and control that the media and television may have on people all around the world. The movie proves that although our views may seem much different than they would have been during WWII, they are more similar than we may think. During the movie, Hitler creates propaganda against the media and television, yet it is being shown on the television and throughout media. The cinematographic, and dramatic aspects can be clearly seen throughout the movie. Some camera angles showed the disorientation and confusion that Hitler had while walking around the city. Makeup was used to enhance the dirtiness and disheveled look when he had woken up. The uniform looked dirty and old, yet looked like an authentic WWII uniform which added a sense of realness to the film. From the camera angles in a birds eye view to the makeup when Hitler had first woken up, the aspects help the movie to be more believable and interesting to watch. Although the movie was humorous most of the time, it became slightly uncomfortable towards the end. Seeing the true reality of our world and how easily we can be persuaded was uncomfortable considering that so many people that were not actors in the movie played along with Hitler and found him to be truly believable. Although this film may be offensive to some, it is important to take it lightly and not be offended by the movie. The movie's intention is to be humorous and lighthearted; however, it holds a serious message that should to be taken with thought.",Look Who's Back

The movie involves his discovery of modern-day Berlin, and his endeavors in trying to retain a position of power. Although the movie deals with sensitive content that may offend some, it tip-toes the line of being too offensive by adding humor. The movie also makes bold statement about current day media and the power that it has. I believe that the movie does a great job of incorporating several cinematic, dramatic, literary components.The point of view shots that are used throughout the film and allow the viewer to experience the disorientation and confusion - emphasized by shaky camera movements - that Hitler experiences after realizing he is in Berlin years after his death. Voice-overs allow viewers to hear Hitler's thoughts and anticipate his plans for the future. The music and visuals towards the end enhance the coming to reality and transition from lighthearted comedy to a realistic social commentary. The use of real people included sporadically created an interesting effect as most agreed with Hitler's ideas and thought that he was quite humorous. I thought that the effect of including the real interactions with people spoke about how persuasive Hitler must have been as well as how people would really react to seeing him in public.Both the actor and the overall appearance of Hitler in this film create a realistic image as if Hitler really were walking the streets of Berlin. The actor has very similar mannerisms and reactions, additionally, the makeup and costuming was extremely believable as mentioned by several characters in the movie. Overall, the dramatic effects of the movie were very well done and realistic.When reading into the meaning of the movie and what social commentary it provides, I believe that it is the strongest impact that can be made on the viewer. Although the movie starts with a lighthearted and comedic tone, the ending quickly transitions to a darker and realistic opinion that can be applied to many individuals' lives. It speaks about how society receives media as individuals find the most controversial material the most entertaining. It also demonstrates that media will ""cross the line"" in order to gain viewers and money. It also emphasizes the massive amount of power that media has on society, and if the attention is put on the wrong content, it only brings more light to the topic, giving it more power.Overall I enjoyed this movie as it edged the line of being offensive, but the level of humor made it less uncomfortable and more enjoyable. I thought that the contrast of this light humor compared to the darker social commentary really added to the film. The dramatic and cinematic aspects were very well done and created a realistic effect. I would recommend those who enjoy comedy movies or movies with strong messages to watch this movie, however, those sensitive to the topics related to the ones discussed in the film may want to avoid watching it.",Look Who's Back
116,millieseltsam,A satire inflicting some uncomfortable feeling,5,27 November 2016,"Seventy years following his suicide in the Fuhrerbunker, Hitler reappears in the same spot, this time in modern day Berlin. The thought of Hitler being reborn, in itself, is an extremely uncomfortable thought. But, this movie continues to elicit incommodity alongside the thought of a Hitler reincarnation. I didn't find it easy to be comfortable while watching this movie. There are many jokes of which a lot of people may find offensive. For this reason, if you are easily offended, I would suggest you veer away from watching this movie. The movie is interesting in the sense of how it's filmed. Different, and quite frankly odd camera angles somehow make the movie a little more catching of the viewer's attention. The movie is also unpredictable as some people are actors, and some are clearly real people going about their normal life. The movie is essentially a documentary of modern day reactions to ""Hitler"", alongside a story about a modern day Hitler. The entire movie is simply absurd. Whether this is a good, or bad thing, I don't know. At many points the movie can be bland, while at the same time plain weird and, unpleasant. Again, I don't know how that's possible. The first half of the movie is much brighter than the second half. The first half an hour of the movie is mainly devoted to both Hitler's reaction to the modernized world, and the people's reaction to Hitler. Meanwhile, the movie tries its very best to incorporate romance, which seems out of place, and unnecessary. While, the second half of the movie's focal point is more to follow the story of how Hitler finds a way to spread his propaganda once again. The ending of this film is eerie, and leaves you with questions, which remain unanswered. Is this movie worth watching? Maybe. It depends if you can handle satire which is chock full of offensive jokes and ideals.",Look Who's Back
117,urquhart_evan,Very Interesting To The Right Viewer,7,27 November 2016,"This movie shows Hitler encountering modern day society and how society reacts to it. Before watching this movie It has to be known that this movie is meant to be satirical. This means that some of the jokes and things that are said are not meant to be taken seriously. At first in the film it is funny some of the things Hitler does. But as the movie progresses, some of the actions Hitler takes and says are extreme. However the people of Germany still see Hitler as a funny act. In reality, Hitler believes that fate has brought him back for him to be in power once again. I enjoyed some of the jokes that were made, but some could be taken the wrong way if it is forgotten that this movie is satire. This movie could also hold some sensitive topics and actions depending on the viewer. This movie is particularly interesting because it shows Hitler's perspectives on modern day technology and problems. This gives and interesting perspective that the view will find entertaining. It is also shown how smart Hitler really was. Hitler is very resourceful in the movie and strategically works his way into positions to get himself heard in modern society. There were not as many actors in this movie as I expected. The actor of Hitler did a great job with his part. He portrayed a realistic impersonation of Hitler and was definitely the most skilled actor of the film. As well, I found the reactions for the random people on the streets very genuine in reaction to Hitler. This movie effectively uses cinematic. During the movie there are a wide variety of camera angles used to enhance the film. The first person camera angle was particularly interesting and made the viewer feel like they were in Hitler's shoes. As the movie progresses, the movie uses camera angle that are lower to the ground to effectively show the power that Hitler is gaining. There are many first person views in this film. They are used to enhance the reactions the pedestrians had with regards to Hitler. The movie directors also used birds eye views in the movie to show the surrounding area to help set the scene in the scenes throughout the movie. This movie is not for the average viewer. In order to enjoy this movie to is maximum potential, it is necessary to know something about Hitler and the time he was in power. This movie can be very entertaining if one can take a joke and is able to comprehend the satirical relevance of this movie.",Look Who's Back
118,mattlavergne,"Brilliant, Entertaining, Eye-Opening",8,27 November 2016,"I personally believe that this movie used satire in a brilliant manner, without crossing any lines or going over board. This movie almost makes you think twice about Hitler. The director had many scenes were he showed Hitler explaining his political views and people agreeing with him. Since so many people agreed with Hitler and his views, it makes the viewer reconsider their feelings towards him. At times I asked myself if he really was such a bad man. Again, since satire was used, it put Hitler in a sort of beneficial light, it showed how powerful Hitler could be, and showed how desensitized people in Germany have become. That being said, not everyone was happy about Hitler being in Germany and I believe that points out the damage that Hitler has done. Because he damaged so many people, it makes the viewer realize how harsh Hitler was. Because this movie was based around satire, it closely related to the movies Bruno and Borat. All these movies use satire to poke fun and ridicule others, and they all use real people and not actors in some scenes. I think by using real people in ""Look Who's Back"" it really showed peoples genuine reaction and feelings towards Hitler. Using real actors can really bring a deeper meaning to a film and a deeper feeling on people beliefs and stand points when it comes to different subjects, such as Hitler. In a cinematic aspect, the film really represented how Hitler can become so powerful. In the beginning of the movie he is taken as a joke, and all of the camera angles are higher up and looking down on him. This represents how unimportant he is and how little power he has. As the movie progresses on, the camera angle becomes lower and lower, showing Hitler in more of a power seat. Because his political views were so supported by many throughout the film, he became more popular and more people started to believe in his views. Dramatically the acting was very well done, it was very believable. The costume that Hitler wore was very authentic and powerful, adding even more of a realistic feel to the movie. Any makeup that Oliver Masucci (Hitler) wore was bang on, and accurately portrayed Hitler. In literary terms the film had an alright plot, although the plot used was vital in order to portray Hitler as he is, it could have been better. The only enjoyable part about the plot was the satire used towards Hitler. A reoccurring theme was fear, throughout the movie, Hitler produces fear in so many. Through his longs speeches about politics and rants using strong words and a powerful tone, he promoted fear. This makes the viewer realize again why so many people followed him in the past. Overall, in my opinion, I think that this movie is a must watch. Throughout the movie it is comedically entertaining and makes you giggle even when such a bad character is involved. It makes you feel like its okay to laugh about Hitler, not because of what he has done in the past or what crimes he's done in WW2, but because the movie is poking fun at specifically him. The film brings to light how vulnerable Germany is, and makes you understand why so many chose to follow Hitler. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, I thoroughly enjoyed it.",Look Who's Back
119,lachlancowann,"""Look who's back"" is a wonderful movie, and I would recommend it to anyone looking to watch an edgy satirical comedy.",8,29 November 2016,"""Look Who's Back"" is a satirical mockumentary about Adolf Hitler's return to modern day society. The film is about Hitler's perspective on the issues we face today. The movie starts off with Hitler waking up in the same place his Führerbunker once stood, an air raid shelter that was used as the Nazi headquarters during World War 2. Once he awakens, he walks around modern day Berlin where everyone he meets thinks he is an actor impersonating Hitler. Hitler finds a newspaper stand where he reads about the issues facing modern day Germany. He faces modern day issues from a Nazi perspective. He is discovered by a local news reporter, Fabian Sawatzki, who brings him to the attention of the media. Hitler becomes famous through a comedy show called ""Whoa Dude!"". He is then put on every show the channel has. With Hitler becoming famous he is given a platform to share his political and ideological ideals to the German population. Sawatzki figures out that he is the real Hitler he tries to stop him, but fails. Hitler goes on to become famous and share his ideas, while Sawatzki is put into a mental institute. The movie shows Hitler's rise to power. The first two thirds of the movie is satirical and funny, but the last third is dark and serious. It was the same as his rise to power, and the same as Donald Trump. It starts off as a joke, and no one takes him seriously, but then people start to agree with him. This is shown in the movie when Hitler walks into Fräulein Krömeier's house when the grand mother is there. The Grand Mother has dementia and does not pay attention or acknowledge anyone, until Hitler walks into the room. As soon as she sees Hitler she gets up and starts yelling saying things like ""I know who you are"" and ""Get out of my house!"". When her Grand Daughter, Fräulein, says that it is just a joke, and satire, the grandmother responds with ""people were laughing at first too"". I found this scene to be very powerful. This is why I enjoyed the movie. Although it is a comedy, it has a dark truth behind it. Another example of having a dark meaning to the movie can be shown at the end of the movie after Hitler is shot, and re-appears. He says to the actor Sawatzki that he is in all of the German people. This shows that Hitler is more of an idea than an actual person. Overall, the movie shows that power can not get into the wrong hands or horrible things can happen. A theme that can be related to the movie is fate/destiny. At the beginning of the movie Hitler says that history repeats itself, and he will rise to power again, and that it is his fate. The whole movie supports this theme because in the 1930s Hitler started off as funny joke, but people started to support and agree with him. Same thing happens in the movie. At first people think that he is just an actor impersonating Hitler and that it is just a big joke, but people start to listen to him and support his ideals and beliefs. This can also be related to the American election. When Donald Trump first announced he was running for president everyone thought that it was a big joke, and that he wouldn't make it that far. But people started to believe in him and back his ideas. Now he is the President of the United States of America. A scene in the movie that supports this relation is when Hitler is being interviewed, and the interviewer asks what his goals are. He responds with ""to make America great again"". This is the same as Trump's campaign slogan. Overall I enjoyed the movie very much and would recommend it. I gave the movie an 8 out of 10. It was an excellent movie, but it left out somethings. First off they didn't have a proper reason for Hitler's return. The movie gives us a poor quality CGI terminator spawn in the reflection of Sawatzki's eyes as he watches the tape of Hitler returning. A better reason could have been science experiment gone wrong or even Hitler's body could have been frozen in a time capsule. In modern day Germany it is illegal to dress up as Adolf Hitler. During the movie the only trouble they get into by the public is by elderly people upset with the fact that someone is imitating Hitler. There is no police phoned or any real consequences. However, if this movie was real I believe that there would have been severe consequences with police and possibly charges against the man dressed as Hitler. Besides these facts, I very much enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to anyone looking to watch an edgy satirical comedy.",Look Who's Back
120,davischong,A Reincarnation of Evil,7,29 November 2016,"If you're looking for a movie that is offensive, racist, and somewhat controversial, the film ""Look Who's Back"" might just be the perfect movie for you. My first impressions of the film made me believe that it was going to be a strictly goofy film making fun of Adolf Hitler, the notoriously cruel and extremist Germany Nazi leader. At the beginning, the mood that was presented was very positive and light-hearted with an ""in your face"" type of humour however, getting further into the film, the content presented became offensive, racist and down right nasty! I realized the movie wasn't really about the life of Hitler but instead had a much deeper meaning. About half way through the movie, the content started to shift into dark, less humorous and even sometimes disturbing events. Although the film contained a great deal of satirical elements, I was impressed that it also held a deeper meaning behind all the comedy and outrageous behavior. With that being said, I found the movie to be highly intriguing as it was hysterical at some points, as well as very dark during certain scenes. For example, I found the movie to be especially funny mainly because of how unlikely and outrageous the plot of this movie was and also because of the dark humour used. The movie used extremely offensive and racist jokes but it was all intended as satire. I believe this satire has the intention of implicitly making social commentary on how media companies will use any topic to make an entertaining and highly profitable show regardless if it is extremely controversial and offensive. It shows that today's media companies can be easily manipulated by Hitler into using his propaganda. As Hitler becomes a perceived comedian to the modern day Germany, people begin to not only laugh at Hitler but also with him as he becomes a highly influential figure. Hitler expresses his ideas and beliefs through televisions shows, and this influences his large fan base to support his beliefs. Although the satire of the film is used to poke fun at media companies, this idea uses Adolf Hitler as an instrument to reinforce the overall theme of media manipulation which is consistently presented through the film.",Look Who's Back
121,barrettsapunjis,This movie is not for everyone but can be really good,7,1 December 2016,"What makes this movie so good? Most movies these days aim to serve enjoyment to the general public. Though ""look who's back"" is a movie that not everybody will like. The movie has some offensive scenes that might make people turn the other way. You have to look past that. I don't believe the movie was not meant to be a sit back and relax type of enjoyment. When watching ""Look Who's Back"" you have to be insightful throughout the movie. Constantly comparing and contrasting the movie to present day and/or thinking of whats really going on. We know Hitler was a bad leader with some terrible decisions. Yet, its hard not to support Hitler (the one in the movie) as he rants about the current problems German citizens have with their country. If you actually think about the topics discussed by Hitler, he is right. Hitler was a smart man who (aside from all the terrible things he did) had his values set well and did what benefits himself the most to climb the ranks in politics. Like when Hitler decided T.V is full of garbage, he is right, we are spending our time mindlessly watching TV while other people are learning and absorbing information. Hitler also does a pretty good job at getting the information he needs. The movie portrays him as being very resourceful. He read many newspapers at the start of the movie to gather intel and took advantage of the people that could help him get viewers. We also have have so many sources to learn from and but when Hitler discovers these he puts them to really good use. Once Hitler finds out about the internet he doesn't uses it for enjoyment, he uses it solely for finding more information. We also see in the movie how politicians work and how they get you on there side. In the movie lots of people listened to the ""new"" Hitler because they thought he was funny, then they realized he has some good ideas. Sooner then later he already had people on his side. If you compare these thoughts between the movie and modern day you might end up thinking about Trump. Both these men were straight forward and seem to express there hate towards different races or anything else in the world. Yet they both rose to power. Maybe the two politicians gained viewers from being so straightforward. Maybe People tuned in because they thought Trump was funny. This ended up giving Trump a platform to talk about his goals for the country. The exact same thing that happened in ""Look Who's Back"". Everything that you get out of the movie that isn't even being said or shown is what makes this movie good. That comes from the viewer's insight. So somebody that just wants to ""sit back and relax"" may not like this movie or see how great it actually is. To conclude the Title of the review, It is the viewer that makes the movie so good.",Look Who's Back
122,seansutton-36358,Forces one to ponder the integrity of the media,8,2 January 2017,"""Look Who's Back"" is a phenomenal movie that utilizes a light and comical tone which is then contrasted by a dark and serious character, Adolf Hitler. This creates satire, allowing the movie to be especially impactful as it depicts pre-World War 2 ideas gaining support in a modern context, with the media having a key role in allowing one of the most tyrannous villains of human history to gain a platform to deliver his beliefs to the general public. Before I was introduced to the film I was forewarned of the dark message hidden under a thin layer of comedy. This warning did not fully prepare me for the unsettling way that Hitler was received by the German people. It brought to light how modern entertainment may often support controversial topics, as it interest's viewers. Hitler often delivers speeches laced with racism and sexism and is rarely contradicted through his journey to ""make Germany great again"". Adolf Hitler first rose to power as he promised to solve conflict, times were bad in Germany as a result of the post World War 1 repercussions and economic ties with the United States. Once in a position of power he delivered the public a scapegoat for Germanys many problems, he chose those of the Jewish religion. The movie parallels this situation in more modern context. Adolf chooses the government in power as the cause of economic problems and the apparent loss of pride of the ""original"" German population. He then chooses his scapegoat, the refugees of various countries that are experiencing conflict at the time. As his voice and influence increases over the course of the film, it becomes increasingly apparent that a section of the population agree with his ideals and are willing to support his ideals. I watched this movie just as the 2016 American presidential election came to its conclusion, with Donald Trump coming into power. The parallels that I found between Donald Trumps election campaign and Adolf Hitler's rise to power in ""look Who's Back"" were striking. Not only do they share a similar ""moto"", to make their respective country, but their utilization of media, to create crisis and create a need for change. The time line that ""look Who's back"" covered, did not show the legacy effects Hitler's ideals would have had on both Germany and the world. It is impossible to determine whether the population would prove to be immune to his hate inspiring speeches and would go on to forget him among the many other comedy acts or if his actions would create an anger so great no country could singularly avoid conflict. Likewise, the world shall experience the rise of Donald Trump as the leader of the most powerful country in the world, where will mankind be in five years? Ten years? Twenty years? Look whose back world.",Look Who's Back
123,cook_alexandra-80473,Sickeningly Real,8,4 December 2016,"Look Who's Back is a satirical film that accurately highlights some of today's biggest problems, including racism and xenophobia as well as one of the media industry's most pressing ethical dilemmas: how far, is too far? The film begins with Adolf Hitler falling from the sky and waking in modern-day Germany. Throughout the film, the audience is given an up-close and personal look into Hitler's subconscious as he attempts to navigate himself through a world filled with television and the internet as well many other modern technologies we take for granted, all the while on a path to once again have power over Germany and the rest of the world. Look Who's Back uses a very creative approach while filming by interviewing real people instead of actors for many scenes. By doing this, the film felt much more genuine and reactions to modern day Hitler were grippingly real. As well, the use of filming the opening scene in Hitler's eyes, so to speak, made me feel like I was directly placed into the film which was very powerful. I enjoyed the film's ""mockumentary"" style with little unnecessary special effects because it allowed viewers to focus on the actual plot line taking place. Personally, watching this movie made me very uncomfortable and I found the entire experience somewhat vexing. Often times, Hitler's general dislike of anybody who did not fit his image of ""perfection"" became very apparent on screen when he would speak with everyday people and urge them to join his cause. This always left a very bad taste in my mouth because even though I did see all of the points that the writers were trying to get across, it just felt very tacky to me. However, this does not mean that I didn't thoroughly appreciate everything that this film was trying to communicate. Throughout the film, Hitler is used as a tool to address many problems facing the Western World. Hitler becomes very popular with Germany through the use of many different media platforms such as YouTube, radio and television programming. At first, I did not find it believable that network executives would ever allow a crude and uncivil ""Hitler Impersonator"" on their television programs because of the disrespect and lack of ethics it shows. But as the film went on, I began to see that in real-life modern day Europe, and North America as well, it is perfectly plausible that networks would be materialistic and selfish enough to allow hate speakers and controversial shows like the ones in the film onto their network, as long as it brought in more viewers and profits. This is seen when MyTV executives hire a group of comedians to make extremely rude and anti-Semitic jokes for their show Woah Dude, in an attempt to gain viewership. Look Who's Back was dead on with their interpretation of current day media corruption. As the film progresses, it goes from a somewhat light-hearted political satire to a very accurate and disturbing social commentary on how easily people as a mass are lead astray from their values and ethics in times of distress. The entire film can be used as an allegory for Adolf Hitler' original rise to power, through use of manipulation and false promises of a better and more stable future for Germany, Hitler played off of people's natural fear of the unknown and existing bias and prejudice to take control of the country. This can be seen in clips of the movie, as real life people are interviewed and asked questions about giving their support for modern Hitler. Many of them at first believe this all to be a joke and react by playfully voicing their ""support' for Hitler. This makes me feel nauseous because I simply cannot fathom anyone even speaking to somebody dressed in that ridiculous costume and asking distasteful and offensive questions, but I suppose it is done purposefully to get lots of reactions out of the audience. However, as the film goes on, the interviews slowly become more serious as people begin to express their sympathy with the xenophobic comments Hitler is making, such as letting Polish people into the country will destroy the economy. By the end of the film, Hitler has gained so much popularity that as he drives down the street people smile and wave at him and clips are shown of people burning flags and rioting. Look Who's Back is a hauntingly realistic roller coaster of humor, controversy and compelling ethical quandaries.",Look Who's Back
124,samshephard-95357,A combination of senseless humor in a compellingly real look on humanity.,7,4 December 2016,"""Er ist weider da"", or for the sake of simplicity, ""Look Who's Back"" simply serves to supply the audience with slapstick satirical humor within the scaffolding of a serious subject matter.I first heard of this movie from my English 20 teacher when she announced that we would be doing a film study about a comedic documentary about the resurrection of Adolf Hitler in the present day; I immediately thought to myself, This is going to be ludicrous!, how on the face of this planet was someone able to make this movie! I organized my preconceived ideas about the movie: How accurate is the actor who portrays Hitler? How many racist jokes can I expect? Is the story genuinely humorous or a senseless, rinse and repeat of comedy seen in about every family film? Many of my preconceived opinions dissolved as I was immersed into a rich anomaly in the comedy genre which did it justice.The combination of literary, dramatic, and cinematic techniques were unique and carefully planted throughout the film. The use of the first-person perspective shots that were scattered throughout the film and brought a new spice to table, {Spoilers} the symbolism regarding Hitler's climb to popularity in Germany involving how gradually, he begins to appear with more and more articles of his prewar uniform, until at the very end, as he and Ms. Bellini are driving away, he looks identical to his prewar self.Dark humor is particularly rare in most comedies as there is a fine line between it being funny, and it being violent, dull and supremely stupid. I believe that this movie pulled off the dark humor for the most part {Spoilers} regarding whether anyone found the scene when Hitler shot the dog funny or not ( personally I thought it fit soundly). For most part, the movie served to give us the audience adequate doses of slapstick comedy, dark humor, and enough politics to emphasize a serious tone.I was very surprised about the ending of this film as it completely shifted 180 degrees in the last 30 minutes of the film. {Spoilers} The movie shifts from a very light-hearted tone where Hitler and Sawatzki are making a movie about a book that Hitler wrote which the movie is based off of in real life ( 4th wall break!), to Sawatzki being put into a insane asylum and Hitler telling the audience about his plans to take over the world, again.This blood relative of many westernized mockumentaries challenges the question, Is it too soon to make movie about the resurrection of Adolf Hitler in present day Germany? And how will people react? Though this movie is designed to be satirical in its subject matter, it takes this into consideration, and attempts to address this by having real people voice their opinions. Despite the mass genocide of Jews in WW2 that was orchestrated by Hitler himself, real German people actually humored him. The extent of the obscurity displayed by German citizens even went as far as endorsing future ""political movements"" and praising him.Overall, the contrasts in this film gave it a unique addition to the comedy genre, and succeeded at his make purpose, getting people to talk about it.",Look Who's Back

126,magikdelowe,A must watch!,10,19 July 2017,"I kept this movie in my backlog for too long. At first I thought it's going to be another silly comedy with a character from the past waking up in modern days and gasps in wonder how this 'magical' technology works. It wasn't the main reason I put it aside though. I thought it's going to be full of exaggerated moral lessons and whatnot. Oh boy I was wrong. It's true that the main character IE Adolf Hitler discovers wonders of the modern world, but the movie doesn't make a big deal of out it. It plays it out to Hitler character. He is amazed and excited how can he use modern technology to further his goals. Hitler makes a lot of commentary about modern state of media which is pretty universal and not exclusive to German media. I think everyone can take few interesting lessons here. The most funny part of the movie in my opinion is how he reacts to the modern politics. I don't want to spoil it, but I was really amused with what party he identified the most(at least at first). It made sense actually. I really liked and laughed out loud when Adolf took jabs at his political ""successors"". His commentary about how pathetic they are were spot on and faces these people made were priceless. In my opinion it was the best scene in the movie after his first TV speech. It's worth mentioning that acting(and writing of course) is really superb. A+ for actor playing Adolf Hitler. Oliver Masucci was born to play this role! Charismatic, smooth talker and really believable. His screen presence was absolutely overwhelming. Without him it wouldn't be the same movie.The much feared by me moral lessons are of course there, but it's not hamfisted to the point you want to just puke. They are actually smart social commentary even if I don't fully agree with them. Movie actually made me question what the real message is and I like this in movies. It makes them less a masturbatory propaganda material to remind you what moral stance you should have and more a movie that makes you seek answers on your own.I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anyone interested at least a bit in politics and history. I don't remember the last time I laughed so much and at the same time was enough interested in the movie to be sad it ended. To everyone else I can give a solid recommendation.",Look Who's Back
