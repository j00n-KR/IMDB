0,SnoopyStyle,not terrible,5,21 May 2020,"Five contest winners arrive on Fantasy Island. Mr. Roarke (Michael Peña) explains that the island will grant each person a fantasy of their own. Gwen Olsen (Maggie Q) wants a life-altering change. Melanie Cole (Lucy Hale) wants revenge on school bully Sloane Maddison (Portia Doubleday). Stepbrothers Brax Weaver (Jimmy O. Yang) and J. D. Weaver (Ryan Hansen) want to party. Patrick Sullivan (Austin Stowell) wants to be a soldier like his dead hero father. Damon (Michael Rooker) is a weirdo lurking in the jungle.I expected terrible. It's good that it exceeded my expectations but it's still not good enough. First, Fantasy Island must, must, must start with a weird Tattoo saying, ""Da Plane! Da Plane!"" I've never sat through an entire episode but everybody knows about Da Plane! I appreciate the attempt at making an origin story but not starting with Da Plane really sets the movie off on the wrong foot. I'd rather have Peña be the new Tattoo anyways. He has a nice playful darkness that was the key to Villechaize's playful imp. As for the premise, it's fine to turn the TV show into a horror movie. I'm fine with each character's fantasy. The connection is an interesting twist. Surprisingly, I'm going along with the movie at this point. Once the twist happens, the movie should get to the climatic action and wrap it up quickly. There is too much in the last act. It doesn't need complexity. The movie needs to end sooner in a more straight forward way. I almost gave this a surprising six.",Fantasy Island
1,claudio_carvalho,Highly Entertaining,7,22 April 2020,"A group of guests arrive at the Fantasy Island, a paradisiacal tropical resort hosted by the mysterious Mr. Roarke (Michael Peña) and his staff, with the promise that their secret fantasies or dreams come true in the island. He interviews each new arrival to make clear that their fantasies just end when concluded and to confirm each wish. Gwen Olsen (Maggie Q) regrets the day she said no to the proposal of her boyfriend. Melanie Cole (Lucy Hale) seeks revenge on her high-school mate Sloane Maddison (Portia Doubleday). Patrick Sullivan (Austin Stowell) dreams on being a soldier like his father. The gay Brax Weaver (Jimmy O. Yang) and his brother J. D. Weaver (Ryan Hansen) just want to party. But soon they realize that there is a price to pay to the island for the wishes come true.""Fantasy Island"" is a highly entertaining fantasy film with good twists. The Metascore and the IMDb User Rating are ridiculous, misguiding the viewers. The plot is a combination of ""The Twilight Zone"" with the franchise ""House"" (1985) and not a horror movie. Fortunately, I did not read the reviews in IMDb and I look forward waiting for a sequel. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil: ""A Ilha da Fantasia"" (""The Fantasy Island"")",Fantasy Island
2,nogodnomasters,Everything is Possible,4,24 February 2020,"Michael Peña runs Fantasy Island where everything is possible. Even Michael Peña doesn't know why. A group of people comes to the island to have their fantasies come true, but the island is evil and works more like a monkey's paw.The fantasies begin to overlap and people actually die. The group wants it to end and wants off. The feature had potential but somehow misses the mark on great entertainment. The characters had no hook.Guide: No sex or nudity. 1 F-word.",Fantasy Island
3,kosmasp,What's your fantasy?,7,21 June 2020,"It's an obvious case of ""be careful what you wish for"" (or fantasy about) ... it may come true. And this island seems to be able to do just that, for better or worse. Now seeing the rating one would be excused to think this is completely bad, not good at all. And while this is a one trick thing (and the theatre version was a PG13 version, instead of the longer cut released for home video/streaming), it does kind of work.Not to mention the really good effects and the actors who seemingly have fun on this great island (in reality that is). I think the fun can be seen and it does translate onto screen. You may not agree with every decision the characters option to go for ... but you can't fault the whole movie for it. Also if you are honest there have been way worse movies. Cinematography, editing, effects, all have a certain standard. I do wonder if the rating would have been higher if they'd gone with the longer cut from the get go ... Likely I'd say",Fantasy Island
4,jboothmillard,Blumhouse's Fantasy Island,4,4 March 2021,"I only know of the original 1977 TV show because of it starring Ricardo Montalban and Hervé Villechaize, and the catchphrase ""Ze plane! Ze plane!"" (which I heard in Daffy Duck's Movie: Fantastic Island, an animated general parody of the show). I had previously seen the trailer for this movie, which serves as both a scary reimagining and prequel to the show, it was one of the last movies to be released in cinemas before the COVID-19 pandemic forced cinemas to close, directed by Jeff Wadlow (Cry Wolf, Kick Ass 2, Truth or Dare). Basically, a group of unacquainted guests have won a contest, bringing them to the enigmatic Fantasy Island, a tropical resort where their fantasies apparently come true. The guests are businesswoman Gwen Olsen (Razzie nominated Maggie Q), former police officer Patrick Sullivan (Austin Stowell), stepbrothers J. D. (Ryan Hansen) and Brax Weaver (Jimmy O. Yang), and disturbed Melanie Cole (Razzie nominated Lucy Hale). Upon arrival, overseer of the mysterious island, Mr. Roarke (Michael Peña) explains that each of them will be given one fantasy, that they cannot change it, and that they must see it through to its natural conclusion. In their fantasy, J. D. and Brax become honoured guests at a mansion where a rave party surrounded by beautiful women (and men, as J. D. is gay) having a rave party. Patrick enters a fantasy where he is enlisted into the military, which he missed the opportunity to do, to honour the memory of his late father. In her fantasy, Gwen goes back in time to accept the marriage proposal of her ex-boyfriend Allen Chambers (Robbie Jones) which she rejected years ago. Melanie meanwhile has the fantasy to take revenge on her childhood bully Sloane Maddison (Portia Doubleday). While torturing Sloane, Melanie realises it is really happening when video footage of Sloane cheating on her husband is uploaded to social media. Sloane has been kidnapped and brought to the island against her will. Melanie saves her from a malicious masked surgeon, and they run away. Meanwhile, Patrick is captured by American soldiers who take him to their commander, Lieutenant Sullivan (Mike Vogel). Patrick realises that he is his father, and the fantasy has taken Patrick to his father's last mission before his death. Sullivan does not initially believe Patrick is his son, but telling him details only he would know, he is convinced. As night falls, Melanie and Sloane are attacked again by the surgeon before he is killed by Damon (Michael Rooker), a private investigator who lives in the island. Damon takes them to a cave where he explains that the fantasies are created by the spring water under a glowing rock. Damon reveals that he was investigating Roarke until he was offered a fantasy to see his deceased daughter, but it turned into a living nightmare that trapped him on the island. The trio collect some spring water and continue to the resort to ask for help. Meanwhile, Gwen wakes up in her fantasy to discover that she has a child with Allen. Roarke appears and explains that he is living his own fantasy of being reunited with his deceased wife, and it will be fulfilled as long as the guests are granted their fantasies. Gwen convinces Roarke to change her fantasy. Soon, Fantasy Island begins to turn the other fantasies into living nightmares. J. D. And Brax are taken hostage by the mansion's owner who is part of a drug cartel. Gwen is taken to the night she accidentally caused a fire that killed her neighbour Nick Taylor (Evan Evagora). All the other guests, except Melanie, are present during that same night, with Patrick as a police officer, and J. D. and Brax escaping the burning building. Gwen tries to save Nick but fails and she is rescued by Roarke's personal assistant, Julia (Parisa Fitz-Henley). At the same time, Sullivan's soldiers are called to rescue some hostages, who turn out to be J. D. and Brax. After being murdered, the drug lords reanimate as zombies who attack the soldiers. In the ensuing chaos, J. D. is shot dead and Sullivan sacrifices himself so that his son and Brax can escape. Melanie and Sloane are ambushed by the zombified surgeon until Damon sacrifices himself, taking the zombie and himself over the cliff, killiing them. The remaining guests regroup at the resort, but are cornered by Roarke, who reveals that they are part of someone else's fantasy in which they are all killed. Realising that everyone was involved in Nick's death, the guests deduce that this is Roarke's fantasy, believing that he and Julia are Nick's parents. The guests escape to the dock to be rescued by a plane sent by Damon's associates, but it is shot down. The group run to the cave to destroy the glowing rock with a grenade that Patrick has. Suddenly, Melanie stabs and wounds Patrick before taking Sloane hostage. She reveals that this is her true fantasy, having orchestrated the contest to seek revenge on the guests for Nick's death, she was supposed to have a date with him on the night he died. It is also revealed that Julia is Roarke's dead wife brought back to life. When Julia begins to die, she convinces Roarke to let her go to save his guests from the island before disappearing. Remembering the spring water that she collected before, Sloane drinks it and fantasises Melanie being together with Nick. This causes Melanie to be attacked by Nick's zombified corpse, which drags her into the water. Before drowning, Melanie pulls the grenade, but Patrick sacrifices himself by throwing himself onto it as it explodes to protect the others. The fantasy concludes, and Gwen, Sloane and Brax wake up at the resort, where Roarke finally allows them to leave. As the three survivors board a plane to leave the now-purified Fantasy Island, Brax wishes for J. D. to return to life and go home. Roarke explains that Brax must remain on the island for his fantasy to come true. J. D. Is revived and boards the plane with Gwen and Sloane. As the plane takes off, Roarke asks Brax to be his new personal assistant and to have a nickname. Remembering a nickname his stepbrother gave him at college, Brax chooses to call himself ""Tattoo"", initiating the events of the TV show. Also starring Kim Coates as Devil Face, Charlotte McKinney as Chastity, Ian Roberts as Dr. Torture, and Jeriya Benn as Lila. The cast are all fine, the special effects are reasonably good, the fun moments of the fantasy scenarios, especially the pool party, are fun to watch, some scary moments get your attention a little, there are the little homages to the show (including the catchphrase) and the Fiji locations are gorgeously colourful. What lets this film down is a predictable script, the dark spin on the familiar TV show being a cautionary warning is silly, the twists towards the end get complicated and confusing, and a sort-of happy ending is daft, overall, this is an average supernatural horror. It was nominated for Worst Picture, Worst Screenplay, and Worst Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel. Okay!",Fantasy Island
5,BA_Harrison,De Plane awful.,3,7 March 2020,"Having just watched Fantasy Island, a Blumhouse horror based on the '70s TV series, I have developed some pretty dark fantasies of my own involving director Jeff Wadlow, writers Jillian Jacobs and Christopher Roach, a heavy duty vice and a blow-torch.For a while, I managed to have a reasonable time with the sheer cheesiness of the script, the diabolical acting, and the lame attempts at horror, but at 109 minutes, it's way too long for a trashy piece of B-movie schlock, and tedium soon takes hold.The film sees a group of competition winners arriving on the titular island where their enigmatic host Mr. Roarke (Michael Peña) tells them that their deepest fantasies will become reality. This is true, but as time passes, their dreams become nightmares and it would appear that the guests are in fact part of someone else's fantasy - someone seeking revenge for past indiscretions.Featuring a mad doctor with a stapled shut mouth, dead soldiers reliving a dangerous mission, a crazed private eye lurking in the undergrowth (Michael Rooker giving a career worst performance), masked armed drug dealers, a spot of Saw-like torture, and a wild pool party complete with big-breasted models and muscle-bound hunks, it might sound as though boredom wouldn't be an option. Unfortunately, this isn't the case, the convoluted post-twist final act dragging on for far too long with little in the way of logic but plenty of contrivances.After much inane nonsense, and a particularly dumb denouement, the film closes with a dreadful 'tattoo' joke to make fans of the original TV series hate this cinematic turkey even more.",Fantasy Island
6,paul_haakonsen,This was an abysmal movie experience...,3,14 April 2020,"Granted, I was lured in by the promise of the movie's poster, the fact that it was labeled as a horror movie, plus that Michael Peña and Maggie Q was on the cast list.Little did I know what I was in for actually. Turns out that this movie was a mess of a storyline. The character gallery was for the most part a very flaccid and pointless one, to be bluntly honest. And that gave the actors and actresses very little to work with. And it didn't help that the storyline written by Jillian Jacobs, Christopher Roach and Jeff Wadlow seemed like they were individually told to write something on a concept without talking and sparring together. It was just a mess and a pain to sit through, literally.Not even the performances of Michael Peña, Maggie Q or Michael Rooker could do much to lift up this train wreck of a movie.I managed to sit through the movie in its entire length, but I must admit that my attention was failing the things that happened on the screen. The storyline was just way too clumsy and incoherent to catch my attention.It should be said that some of the visuals in the movie were actually good, but that could only do so much to salvage the rest of the movie.While I suffered through the entire movie, I can now check it off of my watched movie list and I know for a fact that I will never be returning to watch this 2020 movie again - ever.My rating of ""Fantasy Island"" lands on a very generous three out of ten stars. And I put it on three solely because of Michael Peña and Maggie Q, truth be told.",Fantasy Island
7,CinemaSerf,A Nick Nack short of a Tattoo...,4,6 March 2020,"I'm on a roll! First we had ""Harley Quinn"" then ""Like a Boss"" and now.... At this rate, cinemas around the world will be empty long before any fears of Covid-19 take further hold. ""Fantasy Island"" is pretty dreadful. The premiss is that 5 beautiful people arrive on a tropical island to live out their fantasies. Of course, it doesn't end with a few tequila slammers and some hot sex: oh no - we have unstoppable zombies and sea snakes; drug lords and an evil doctor with his mouth stitched shut. As each character initiates their fantasy, we discover that it's not quite clear if they are in their own or someone else's dream scenarios - and that builds to a remarkably tepid nightmarish conclusion. Ryan Hansen & Jimmy Yang seem to be trying to establish a double act (they have similarly fraternal roles in ""Like a Boss"") and although Maggie Q does try to bring some gravitas to this; she cannot hold back the tide en seul. It'll be fine to watch on telly late on a Friday night, but nothing else redeeming about it, sorry...",Fantasy Island
8,zardoz-13,Forget this Forgettable Fantasy,3,26 February 2020,"British author W.W. Jacobs coined the phrase, ""Be careful what you wish for, you may receive it."" Chiefly, Jacobs is known for his grisly short story ""The Monkey's Paw."" Penned in 1902, the tale features a severed primate's paw. A devilish holy man in India casts an evil spell on it and gave it to a British soldier. The Briton could make three wishes and the simian's extremity would grant them to its owner. According to the soldier, the holy man ""wanted to show that fate ruled people's lives and that those who interfered with it did so to their own sorrow."" When I was in middle school in 1968, I read this creepy yarn, and I've never forgotten it. Most of what happens in ""Kick Ass 2"" director Jeff Wadlow lackluster horror movie ""Fantasy Island"" deals with wish fulfillment and its consequences. A twentysomethings' quintet has the chance of a lifetime to conjure up their dreams at a lush paradise resort island hotel. Not only do these delusional dupes suffer for what they sought, but the audience does, too! Horror comes in the form of jump-scares scattered throughout this second-rate saga that inspired by the vintage ABC-TV series ""Fantasy Island"" (1977-1984), co-starring Ricardo Montalban and pint-sized sidekick Hervé Villechaize. For the record, Malcolm McDowell replaced Montalban in the short-lived ""Fantasy Island"" sequel in 1998.The ""Fantasy Island"" premise had promise, but Wadlow and co-scribes Jillian Jacobs and Christopher Roach provide little of either dread or excitement. Blumhouse Productions, headed by Jason Blum, has been producing quality horror features for the last fifteen years. The ""Paranormal Activity,"" ""Sinister,"" and ""Purge"" movies constitute some of its successful franchises. Let's not forget director Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"" (2017) and ""Us"" (2019). Alas, not everything Blum and Blumhouse Productions has produced has panned out. ""The Gallows,"" M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Visit,"" the ""Ouija"" movies, and ""The Boy Next Door"" rank as Blum's blights. The catch, however, is most Blumhouse movies boast such ultra-low budgets that they recoup not only their costs, but they also earn enough often to justify sequels. Not surprisingly, despite its rich potential and abortive promise, ""Fantasy Island"" has tripled its $ 7-million production costs, earning over $24-million globally, and with a good chance for a sequel.As ""Fantasy Island"" opens, five people are flown into the resort. Melanie Cole (Lucy Hale of ""Scream 4""), Gwen Olsen (Maggie Q of ""Mission: Impossible III""), Patrick Sullivan (Austin Stowell of ""Whiplash""), and stepbrothers JD Weaver (Ryan Hansen of ""G. I. Joe: Retaliation"") and Brax Weaver (Jimmy O. Yang of ""Crazy Rich Asians"") were all winners in a television contest for a weekend retreat at an idyllic hideaway. Of course, this is what Wadlow and his co-writers want us to believe. Before its interminable 110 minutes ends, you'll know something far sinister was planned collectively for all five of them. Meantime, each must experience a fantasy, and we are treated to a variety. A former city policeman, Patrick wants to rumble in the jungle like a soldier, so he can sample the shenanigans that his heroic military father, Lieutenant Sullivan, lived and died for in combat. As it turns out, Patrick never knew his pop, so imagine his surprise when he encounters him during his rugged escapade! JD and Brax want to quench their loins, reflecting their different sexual preferences, with gals and guys galore. Melanie wants to exact vengeance on a ""Mean Girls"" bully, Sloane (Portia Doubleday of ""Carrie""), who made her high school years an ordeal. Finally, Gwen hasn't recovered from rejecting a marriage proposal from Rocklin (Robbie Jones of ""American Dreamer"") several years ago. She has lamented the loss of either the love of a husband or a daughter. The enigmatic Mr. Roarke (Michael Peña of ""The Mule"") welcomes them to the island. ""Regret is a disease,"" he comments before he specifies the two rules of ""Fantasy Island."" First, they cannot change fantasy because they don't like it. Second, they must see their fantasies through to either good or bad ending. Meanwhile, a harried private investigator skulking about the island, Damon (Michael Rooker of ""Guardians of the Galaxy""), has discovered the source of Roarke's incredible power and he wants one of the guests to alert the outside world. Gradually, the fantasies of our quintet, including Mr. Roarke, intertwine for one complicated exercise in screwball horror that involves more than just them. Along the way, we see a lot of eerie zombies bite the dust, and their eyes squirt dark oil. Gwen has the most challenging and complex fantasy when she learns that five years have passed, and Rocklin and she have had a daughter! Alternately, Melanie wants to torture Sloane, but she has second thoughts and relents.You won't find any slices of provocative horror in ""Fantasy Island."" This contrived potboiler doesn't baptize audiences in buckets of blood and gore. Indeed, blood is incidental to the convoluted plot with its 22 characters going in circles. The best jump scare occurs near the beginning. A staff member surprises one of the guests in her room. Afterward, nothing tops this single moment. Of course, since it received a PG-13 rating, nobody gallivants about in the buff, while some supporting characters cavort in risqué swimwear, exposing off bronzed, often bodacious physiques. Despite its rating, ""Fantasy Island"" is LGBTQIA friendly, with an openly gay male character. Otherwise, everybody else is straight. Nobody gives a bad performance, but these characters are both so superficial that they generate little charisma, and we never feel sympathetic to their plight. Meanwhile, the rest realizes too late their fantasies have been sabotaged by the island. Wadlow shoulders most of the blame for the failure of ""Fantasy Island"" to live up to its premise. This sophisticated hokum amounts to more of a soap opera with moments of violence and horror which wouldn't give anybody goosebumps. Little about ""Fantasy Island"" qualifies as imaginative enough to recommend it as entertainment.",Fantasy Island
9,grantss,Weak,3,29 October 2020,"A collection of people are invited to an exclusive island. The owner offers them the opportunity for them to live out their fantasies but they quickly learn that things aren't as they seem.I had low expectations for this film initially as it looked like a B-grade horror movie, at best. However, it showed some promise with the fantasies-within-reality layers and some other interesting themes, plus purely as a thriller.Unfortunately, this was short-lived as it quickly degenerated into horror cliches and unravelled. The plot got sillier and sillier the more it went on, culminating in some ridiculous twists at the end, all of which were just twists for twists' sake. Very stupid.Almost as galling was seeing Michael Pena ham it up as the owner, Mr Roarke. Very cringeworthy performance.Avoid.",Fantasy Island
10,neil-476,Surprisingly good,8,18 March 2020,"5 people arrive by seaplane to pursue 4 fantasies on Fantasy Island, under the watchful eye of Mr Roarke. The fantasies all seem relatively straightforward - one wants to be a hero soldier like his late father, one wants to correct the worst mistake she ever made, two brothers just want to have a hedonistic millionaires fun weekend, and one wants revenge on a school bully. What could possibly go wrong? Well, the opening sequence where a terrified woman is chased and caught is a clue, as is the fact that the UK Censor's card reveals that the film's full title is Blumhouse's Fantasy Island, Blumhouse being a horror production house.So,the old TV series reimagined as a horror. It's not a bad idea, and the 4 tales here (and the wider story they become part of) are nicely contrived and ravelled together.The cast is decent, with Michael Pena doing well as Mr Roarke. The production values all show on screen, and the film resolves well, with a very welcome kicker at the very end.This was pretty good.",Fantasy Island
11,mm-39,A woke Fantasy Island!,5,24 February 2020,"Fantasy Island of my childhood was a kids show! There was an innocents of a show which lasted an hour with plot tie ins, formulated stories of do over, if I won money, and ghost etc. The Fantasy Island movie tries to be edgier, more woke like many modern t v series. More different races and sexual orientation reflecting a difference from the 70's show is the Fantasy Island movie. Trying to shock the audience with change is the movie where there is an added features: The Island is evil, and Mr. Roarke of Ricardo Montalban who is smooth and good is replaced with a slimy Michael Peña as a Mr. Roarke who gives out nightmares, and ulterior motives. There is both straight and gay sexual fantasy on a sex Island, and revenge slasher horror movie Fantasy to woke and spice up the Fantasy Island. There is the plot twists, and all stories going together plot devices to keep the viewers guessing. The new Fantasy Island has a few new twists to the old series. Regrettably many new woke shows have to use shock, un-like-able/annoying modern character, and have to sleaze a story up with drugs, sex and violence for a so so story. The new Fantasy Island in the old days would hit 99 cent bin at the old Block Buster back in the day. 5 stars.",Fantasy Island
12,deloudelouvain,Deserves a higher rating for sure.,7,1 May 2020,"If you're a fan of the series and except to watch something similar, something lighthearted, or if you expect seeing a little person playing Tattoo then you'll probably be disappointed. This movie has the same theme but there is a pinch of horror added to it, so if you're not open minded about that just skip it and watch something else. I did enjoy Fantasy Island, it's mindless entertainment, nothing to be taken too seriously. So I don't agree with the negative reviews, but I do agree it was sometimes a bit difficult to follow but overall it's worth a watch. The acting wasn't bad, the horror scenes were good enough for me, and the cinematography wasn't bad at all. After reading all those negative reviews and seeing the low rating it got I almost didn't watch it but now I'm glad I did.",Fantasy Island
13,siderite,More a Scooby-Doo movie than anything else,7,26 November 2020,"The imdb ratings here do not make this film justice. I believe that, like me, a lot of the viewers were intrigued by the promising beginning and severely disappointed by the really bad ending.The story is about a group of strangers coming on a mysterious island where they are each promised to live their biggest fantasy. Here we get a sense of how confused were the makers of the movie: goofy comedy, akin to Scooby Doo, with dark and ominous hints, like a horror story, a distinct video game feel like the Jumanji reboots, but also the promise of emotional catharsis and a deeper lesson at the end. This could go in a variety of directions, some of them really good. Unfortunately the film continues to remain confused until the very beginning, where a completely artificial and nonsensical twist pretty much destroys every premise of the story.Bottom line: the film was entertaining, the acting good, but the plot was a confused mess.",Fantasy Island
14,FeastMode,oozes dumbness,2,2 July 2020,"Nothing in this movie makes sense. the plot overly convoluted and filled with holes. the movie contradicts it's own rules. odd things happen that are never explained or brought up again. this movie is straight madness. and it wasn't a tiny bit scary. plus there were numerous parts where they telegraph what's about to happen. anyone who has seen movies before knows exactly what's coming next.the only reason i didn't give it a one is because i found some entertainment value from it. there were one or two cool ideas. and there was one conversation between two soldiers that really worked for me (1 viewing, 7/1/2020)",Fantasy Island

Premise was interesting enough to keep my attention for like 15 - 20 min. but later with all those twists, very bad dialog, bad acting and bad pacing, this movie felt short. There are characters in this movie that should be in spoof movies, not in this horror thriller. And by the way, this movie is not a horror movie. Its a fantasy thriler with almost eveything in it just bad.Overall, ""Fantasy Island"" was a terrible flick. I did expected this flick to be descent, because i really enjoyed previous flick from this team ""Truth or Dare"", but this one unfortunately was very bad.",Fantasy Island
17,westsideschl,Started Generic But ...,7,15 May 2020,"First quarter or so of the film I was thinking how generic, rehashed, stereotypical this tale was going to be, i.e. off the bat, opening scenes, we meet our future, to be compromised, characters, and got the usual mix from obnoxious to poster praiseworthy. Then towards the end our magical source, as usual, is a growing crystal being in a cave. The twists were a bit confusing at times; not clearly laid out, but interesting none-the-less. The mechanism of how the dead; the past; the current 50+ model partiers were created also not clear, but that's fantasy for you.
Summation: Twists give it a reprieve, so worth watching. And, we're set up for a sequel.",Fantasy Island
18,The-Sarkologist,"Better than Expected, but not by much",7,12 March 2020,"Well, I probably wouldn't have known about this film, let alone gone and seen it, if it wasn't for the fact that the previews for it were forever playing on Spotify. So, I guess that hearing it over and over again one evening I thought that it might be a good idea to check it out. Mind you, I was a little bit dubious about it though because I could see that it was going to be one of those horror/thriller type films, something that the original series (not that I ever watched it) wasn't.So, we have this island where basically all of your fantasies come true. However, there are two rules - you can't change your fantasy, and you have to play it through to the end. Mind you, there is a reason as to why this is the case, but it sort of goes to suggest that there is more going on behind the scenes than what really meets the eye. Of course, we learn that one of the characters wants revenge against a high school bully, but the reality is more evident than otherwise.Personally, I really don't want to give too much away with this film because there is a lot that is actually going on behind the scenes that is building up to the climax. Further, there is quite a number of twists and turns that sort of leaves you wandering what is actually going on. Mind you, the characters sort of can't quite believe that all of this is true, and there is certainly something about the island that makes this to be the case. However, another aspect of the film is about how one's fantasies never actually turn out exactly the way that they want them to, and that there is always a much darker side to it than meets the eyes.Mind you, as I mentioned, there is more going on than meets the eyes, but the problem is that there does seem to be some inconsistency in the movie, that is between the start and the final reveal at the end, and as to what is actually going on. I guess that one thing sort of was designed not to make it too obvious as to the whole mystery behind the island, but in another sense, it does upend the continuity, and consistency, somewhat.Still, in the end, this film did turn out to be somewhat better than I expected, and while I wouldn't necessarily consider it to be one of the best films that I have seen, it was still quite enjoyable.",Fantasy Island
19,slightlymad22,I'd Watch A Sequel,6,6 March 2020,"I just got out of a surprisingly busy showing of Fantasy IslandThis is certainly not the Fantasy Island of my childhood. It's not a good movie, but I kind of dug it. The first half is the best half, before it just turns into a routine Blumhouse flick. There is a good movie in here somewhere. It's pacing is a bit off and at times it drags (mostly Maggie Q's initial fantasy). I came out thinking it was over two hours and I was surprised to see it was about 90 minutes.Michael Pena (an Actor I love) is sadly no Ricardo Montalban, but he is ok. Lucy Hale is pretty decent Austin Powell reminded me of Christian Bale a bit and Michael Rooker is just sort of thereI saw one of the twists coming a mile off as the kept making a big deal of something only to never mention it until the reveal. The dialogue often feels like a first draft and the jump scares are predictable, but I like it when a movie makes me question everything I had just watched and to be honest, I'd watch a sequel.Oh and as a fan of the tv show, I did like the last joke.",Fantasy Island

21,Thanos_Alfie,Boring...,2,26 May 2020,"""Fantasy Island"" is an Adventure - Fantasy movie in which we watch five people arriving at a luxurious island where everything is possible. The owner and operator of the fantasy island states that every person has only one fantasy that can be made true so, each person decides its dream or fantasy and starts living it.I did not like the movie because it was boring and full of unnecessary plot twists which were predictable and made the movie even more boring. At first the theme was interesting but after half an hour everything change and became boring and predictable due to poorly execution. The direction which was made by Jeff Wadlow was not the best but I believe he did everything he could in order for it to become better, although nothing changed. Finally, I have to say that ""Fantasy Island"" is not a good movie for all the reasons I stated above and I believe that even if you do not have high expectations from it you will be disappointed and you will think that you wasted your time watching it.",Fantasy Island
22,cruise01,Decent thriller that is entertaining but forgettable.,6,13 May 2020,"Fantasy Island (3 out of 5 stars).Fantasy Island is a fair supernatural horror film that does lack scares and thrills but does have a decent concept. A concept where people can go to an island and they can have there fantasies fulfilled. Fantasies like redoing a choice during marriage proposal. Or being a hero in the military. Or torturing your bully. Or having a party with a bunch of models. The plot is about several strangers going to an island. After winning a selection of being picked. They meet Mr. Roark (Michael Pena) who is there host. He shows them the rules. And guides them to their fantasies. Except, there is more to these strangers and fantasies which they will soon discover.The plot was decent. I never saw the original series. I am not sure if it is close to the source material. Besides Mr. Roark is a host to a mysterious island where things come true. The concept was pretty neat that the film has several characters with a connection of some kind in the past. Which does have a twist. The film is fast paced moving with some nice decent thrills. But it does lack scares if it was trying for that.The cast ensemble is okay. Lucy Hale was okay playing a character that wants to get back at her bully. Maggie Q playing a character that wants a redo of her choices. Austin Stowell playing an ex officer wants to experience being a soldier. Jimmie O. Yang and Ryan Hansen playing step brothers who want to have a time of there life. Michael Rooker has a nice small role playing a character that's been on the island long enough. And Michael Pena does seem out of place with the character. But he was decent with the role.The movie did have a stupid direction in making characters making dumb choices or logic. One character running out of a burning building. Passes by a person stuck in a room which she yells she would get help. But once she was already out and no one helped. She runs back in. Would have been a lot faster if she tried helping opening the door to that person. There were plenty of other dumb logic and choices. Which does make this a forgettable thriller.",Fantasy Island
23,eddie_baggins,A bizarre misfire you can't turn away from,4,4 June 2020,"When you sit down and ponder old-school TV shows that were crying out for a cinematic re-imagining, the 1970's and 80's Ricardo Montalban starring Fantasy Island isn't one that springs to mind in the first instance.Proving once more that Hollywood knows better (but does it really?), horror producer extraordinaire and king of low-budget, medium grossing hits Jason Blum decided that not only would he turn Fantasy Island into a feature but he'd do it the way of the horror genre, in what has eventually turned out to be one of the most wildly ridiculed and bizarre offerings of 2020.Tasking director for hire Jeff Wadlow with the unenviable job of directing this odd hybrid of comedy, sci-fi and horror, Blum has bitten off more than he can chew this time around, even if the utter bonkers nature of this seriously insane offering ensures it's the type of misfire you can't turn your eyes away from.Feeling like the type of movie that is dealing with multiple films at once, in what's a very bad case of split personality disorder, the film goes from grisly murder, frat like partying comedy to dramatic expose of lost love and family drama all in the space of minutes throughout its runtime.Fantasy Island doesn't seem to know what it wants to be or what it should focus on as we the audience are taken on a wild and unpredictable ride through the picturesque surrounds of its Fiji shot setting.Acting as the films main source of explanation throughout, the slumming it Michael Pena turns up as Montalban's famed Mr. Roarke as the keeper of the mysterious Fantasy Island sets up a series of fantastical requests for his islands newest guests, who quickly discover that their deepest desires aren't always what they are cracked up to be.To say too much more about where the film takes its various cast members, that includes Lucy Hale, Maggie Q, Michael Rooker and potentially the years worst duo team up of Ryan Hanson and Jimmy O. Wang as brothers J.D and Brax would be a disservice to a film that is destined to live a long life on the cult circuit, a venture for cinephiles to pick apart for the years to come as a fine example of movie making gone very very wrong.Final Say -Billed as a horror, Fantasy Island is anything but as the only horror to be found is in its terrible script and bizarre set-ups but this film like no other is highly enjoyable when watched through the eyes of an observer witnessing one of the strangest mainstream films to appear in the last few years.2 panic rooms out of 5",Fantasy Island

25,damianphelps,Enjoyable re-imagining,7,22 September 2020,I'm surprised this movie has a lowish rating. Its a clever take on the original tv show.Visually stunning cinematography with a nice rich palette.The individual stories of the guests were entertaining and it comes together well.Perhaps the key to this movie (and many others) is I didn't know what company produced it (Blumhouse) and I hadn't watched any trailers so I knew nothing going in. So it was all a pleasant surprise.Its a good film.,Fantasy Island

Heard Jason Blum wanted Nic Cage n that wud have saved this film a lil bit. Michael Pena's character is too soft spoken n without any mystery.

This movie is set on a supernatural island n i dont get to see any deadly snakes, insects, monsters or ferocious animals.

This is a prequel to the tv show of the same name and they provide the hint when they introduce the character of Tattoo which was played by the iconic

29,southdavid,Tattoo out of Tatten.,2,25 November 2020,"Though their low budget approach means that virtually every movie they make is guaranteed to be a commercial success, that doesn't protect Blumhouse from critical savaging and the 2020 reimagining of the 1970's series ""Fantasy Island"" as a horror-lite IP feels like the company taking a step away from their comfort zone and misfiring badly.Five contest winners, Gwen (Maggie Q), Melanie (Lucy Hale), Patrick (Austin Stowell) and brothers Brax (Jimmy O Yang) and JD (Ryan Hansen) arrive on a luxury island resort and are told by the operator Mr Roarke (Michael Pena) that their deepest desires will come true here. Though they are soon indulging in their fantasies each takes a dark turn and make them question whether what they thought the wanted, was their true wish.The trouble with ""Fantasy Island"" is all in the writing. The cast are fine, nobody is doing anything amazing, but at the same time, nobody lets the side down. The island looks welcoming and isolated in equal measure. The visual effects are OK, again nothing spectacular but nothing so strikingly awful it ruins the film. On a technical level, the film is solid if uninspired.However, the story sets up rules that the film doesn't then follow through on. It establishes that certain characters within the fantasies aren't real but created by the island. Why then does one notable participant in one of the fantasies need to be really drugged and kidnapped in order to appear on the island, why couldn't they be created too?It's later revealed in the film (I'll try and keep this as spoiler free as I can) that one of the characters has another agenda based on something that happened that each character was involved in. You'll likely piece all this together before the films reveal but it unravels the whole premise of the film. We (the audience) see this character, on their own, interact with things in a way that doesn't make sense, if they are behind it all. It means that this character has two ""wishes"" too, which we're told is forbidden. Also it means that this character found their way to the island before somehow, to start their true fantasy, then left and returned with the rest of the characters. It also would all unravel if, at any point on their flight across, the people had started to talk about where they lived.It's not the worst idea for a film, and I'd be OK with the premise used for another film - but this one unravels the more you think about it.",Fantasy Island

32,paul-allaer,"Pointless and unnecessary ""reimagining"" of ""Fantasy Island""",3,7 July 2021,"As ""Blumhouse's Fantasy Island"" (2020 release; 109 min.) opens, a woman is running for her life, from what we do not know. The next morning, we hear the familiar sounds of a plane approaching, and soon a group of five people, 3 guys and 2 women, are getting off the plane and eager to start their specific 'fantasy', which has been carefully and individually developed and curated by the mysterious Mr. Roarke. At this point we are 10 min. Into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest from director Jeff Wadlow (""Truth Or Dare"", ""Kick-Ass 2""). More importantly, the film is a reimagining of sorts of the late 19070s TV series of the same name. But just to make sure that we understand the reimagation is done from a ""scary movie"" perspective, the film's official title has been updated (but downgraded?) to ""Blumhouse's Fantasy Island"". I am more often than not a fan of the Blumhouse ""scary movie"" output, but I regret to tell you it certainly was not the case for this film. Frankly, I couldn't make heads or tails of it. It's neither scary nor funny. The characters as as bland as they come (in contrast with the TV series, where the recurring cast was full of memorable characters). There was literally nothing in the movie that made me sit up and notice. So what is the point of this ? Beats me. Bottom line: this is one of the weaker Blumhouse movies that I can recall. I wish I could be more positive about this movie, but I just can't. (Contrast this, for example, to another Blumhouse production that was released in theaters a few weeks after ""Fantasy Island"": ""The Invisible Man"" is easily the far better movie, and well worth seeking out.)""Blumhouse's Fantasy Island"" was released in theaters in mid-February. 2020 (yup, just weeks before the movie theater industry shut down resulting from a little thing called COVID-19). I caught it the other day on Starz On Demand. I have to say, I was really disappointed with this film. Of course, you don't have to take my word for it, and hence I'd readily suggest you check it out for yourself, be it on VOD or on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Fantasy Island

Was it good? More weird that good? The story did not fully grasp me or I did not grasp it.

34,jtindahouse,A surprisingly ambitious film with a lot going on,6,15 April 2020,"There should never be as much negative energy around a film before it is even released as there was for 'Fantasy Island'. People seemed to think that because 'Truth or Dare' (a film I actually really enjoyed) wasn't to their liking then Jeff Wadlow's next film had to be the same. This film is far from perfect, but it certainly has a lot more going for it and a lot more effort put into it than 90% of the garbage being thrown out in the horror genre today.The first thing I noticed about 'Fantasy Island' before seeing it was that it had a runtime of 110 minutes. This is very odd by today's standards. Very rarely does a horror movie go over 90 minutes long, and if one does it is usually in the vein of 'Midsommar' which pushed right out to around 150 minutes. The reason for the extra 20 minutes in 'Fantasy Island', I quickly realised after beginning to watch it, is because it bites off a lot. There is a tremendous amount going on in this film. There are basically four stories all interweaving and connecting together. The film does its best to juggle them all, but it is an ambitious task it took on.The great thing about there being so much going on is that the movie never lags. The pacing is excellent (until a rough last 20 minutes or so that drag on a little) and before you know it the film is reaching its conclusion. There is quite a mysterious element to the film as well, and before it is revealed what is really going on with the island it is a lot of fun to run through the scenarios and try and work out which direction they are going to take the film in.Where the film lets itself down is in the balance between comedy and horror. Sometimes it just goes way too far down the comedic route, and then two minutes later is asking you to fall right back into the horror path. That isn't an easy transition to make for the audience. Once you get us into a light-hearted, jovial mood it is hard to get out of it. Also the ending of the film leaves a lot to be desired. As I mentioned earlier the film takes on a lot of story, and while it does a decent job of managing it through most of the runtime, wrapping it all up is a different matter. There is a twist that doesn't hit anywhere near as hard as it should. It gets very sloppy, convoluted and basically silly. It's a shame to end the film on that note.There is enough here to make this a watchable film however. The film looks great. It's beautifully shot and the tropical island scenery takes care of itself. The story is ambitious, but ensures you are unlikely to be bored. 'Fantasy Island' is worth a look, but maybe don't get your hopes up too high. You might just find yourself a guilty pleasure.",Fantasy Island
35,DarkVulcan29,Ricardo Montalban is probably turning in his grave.,4,9 March 2020,"This movie had it's moments, but still a terrible movie. Now I've never really watch much of the original T.V. show that starred Ricardo Montalban and Herve Villechaize, now I understand that they didn't want to totally follow it. But it becomes an excuse to bring some shock moments. I just had problems getting infested into any of the characters stories.
Michael Pena performance comes across like he's trying to do a Ricardo Montalban like impression. Lucy Hale acts like she's reading off a cue card. Maggie Q who I seem to get a little invested, cause her story becomes the most watchable. The movie keeps dragging to the point I was waiting for it to end. The movie has a few twists, in my opinion didn't help the story, but just brings it down more.",Fantasy Island

This movie is based on the 1970's tv series Fantasy Island. This is also a movie produced by Blumhouse so you can guess it will be a little different, since Blumhouse usually does horror movies. Michael plays Mr. Roarke, the host of a magical resort type island that has guests fly in on an airplane to have their wishes fulfilled. Lucy & Maggie are a couple of the lucky participants and Parisa is Michael's assistant that goes running to Michael, telling him of the plane's arrival-and no, she is not called 'Tattoo'. Michael tells the people that there are only 2 rules; Only one fantasy per person & they must finish the fantasy, no matter how it turns out. There are some bumps in the fantasies-they don't go according to the guest's wishes-and there are secrets.

The main villainess of FANTASY ISLAND is dubbed ""Melanie Cole,"" because her soul is coal black. Ms. Coal goes out of her way to torture, maim and murder dozens of strangers, just because she's laboring under the delusion that they conspired to ruin her ""first Real date"" with the latest in what is surely a long string of Dream Guys. (Ms.. Coal's lifetime romantic highlights are necessarily limited to first dates, because once anyone starts rubbing elbows with this monkey wrench of a wench they are bound to immediately discover what a sordid failure of a human being she actually is.) Evil torture comes as naturally to Melanie as water off a dolphin's back. Lying, back-stabbing and navel gazing all are second nature to her. To add in salt to injury, even her perceived slights are second- or third rate. For instance, she accuses ""Sloane"" of dumping a bucket of toilet water on her during an eighth grade school dance. Most likely Ms. Coal is conflating the actual scene featuring a vat of PIG'S BLOOD from the CARRIE movies with something that may (or may not) have happened to her in her own tiny life. (Perhaps some girl flicked a few droplets of water toward her from the next sink over in the Girl's Room.) At any rate, If Melanie had had any friends, doubtless she would have organized her own chapter of the Trench Coat Mafia. Because her abrasive personality ruled out any possibility of such close associates (and given her total lack of gumption and stick-to-it-ness), Mr. Coal instead waits until long after her perceived wrongs' expiration dates to take disproportionate revenge.",Fantasy Island

There may have been some just deserts but it always came out good in the end. This movie goes way far to the dark side compared to the original TV show and it does belong in the scary movie genre.The plot is convoluted, but if you stick with it, it can be followed. There are clever twists and surprises. Interesting things start to piece together towards the second half.

The real reason is unknown to me and I will not dig their psyche up or the butter they would require.
More often than not, no sizable sum of money should make up for the ruining of a career and prestige so hardly acquired with hours of hard work and sleeplessness.That's almost exactly what happens here with some good actors/actresses, but a ridiculous movie and terrible writing.
When you had an original (successful) series in the span of 7 seasons with the same title and the same premise some 40 years ago, writers and producers shouldn't bother and get themselves involved in producing a 2020 mock-up movie version with ridiculous screenplay, non-existent suspense, artificially dramatic music and forced acting.Would have been a much more successful, unpretentious movie with total strangers and a new cast.
The existent (famous) cast did nothing, but having concerned looks and shedding tears.Messages of courage, hope and forgiveness could have been delivered by complete new actors who sought a name for themselves in the industry.

45,kirbylee70-599-526179,REVAMPING CLASSIC TV,8,6 June 2020,"When I first heard that they were going to be making a movie of the long running TV series that was so popular when it aired on TV I had reservations. How could they recreate the series in a single film? Then I heard they were going to change it up and make it more of a horror offering. For me that cinched it, this film could not be any good. Fortunately I was wrong. It's a blast.The film opens with a woman on the run in the jungle, hiding in a house where she is soon captured. It quickly changes gears and much as the series did we see a sea plane landing on a mysterious island in the Pacific as a watchful eye sees them land. This is Julia (Parisa Fitz-Henley) who runs and alerts the man in charge, Mr. Roarke (Michael Pena). The occupants of the plane are Gwen Olsen (Maggie Q), Patrick Sullivan (Austin Stowell), step-brothers J. D. (Ryan Hansen) and Brax Weaver (Jimmy O. Yang), and Melanie Cole (Lucy Hale).The group are all winners of a special vacation, a trip to Fantasy Island where all of their dreams will come true. Greeted by Julia she tells them she is his assistant and he will meet them later. She escorts them to the main house and has the staff show them to their rooms along with their luggage.That is except for J.D. and Brax. Instead of a room Roarke meets with them and escorts them to a different part of the island, informing them that their fantasy has already begun. As they come out of the jungle they find a hidden oasis, a fancy house and a huge pool filled with glamorous women and men. It turns out J.D. is there for the models and Brax is gay. Both have their dreams come true as the party gets started with them in control.Roarke meets with the other guests and tells them that their fantasies will begin after they get a good night's rest. The next day we learn what each of them had in mind. Gwen wanted another chance to change her lift and redo her greatest regret, turning down a marriage proposal and living a life with the man she loved, having children. Patrick wants to be a soldier like his deceased hero father. Melanie wants revenge on the girl that tormented her throughout high school.Each one of these individuals has their fantasy come true. But not quite as they expected. Gwen still questions her choice. Patrick is reunited with his deceased father on the mission that he died on. Melanie has the chance to literally torture her tormentor but has second thoughts when a murderer enters the picture. And J.D. and Brax discover that their dream home was actually owned by a drug runner who has returned to reclaim his home.This pattern follows the map left by the original series but it soon becomes different when the characters find themselves crossing over into each other's fantasies. By doing so it enhances the film and makes it much more fun. Just why are their fantasies combining? How far will their fantasies go? Does the island have the ability to bring them back to life if they die during their fantasies? And why is it that Roarke does what he does? What is the secret of the island?All of these questions are answered by the end of the film. The story is far deeper and involved than one would expect from a film like this. It holds your interest from start to finish and runs the gamut of emotions from thrilling action to deep emotional turmoil. Even though the film is pure exploitation it carries enough weight to make it better than the concept used behind it.All of the actors do a fantastic job here. Perhaps standing out are Maggie Q. as Gwen showing a depth of character many of her action roles have not allowed her to do. After this film I look forward to seeing her in more movies. Michael Pena also does a fantastic job here. It seems with each role he takes on his abilities become stronger and he too is someone whose name in the credits will most likely be a draw for me in the future.Potential spoiler: The film does leave an opening for a sequel. Second films are often difficult to carry off with enough surprises to match the first film. I for one would like to see another film, to see this turn into a franchise. But the box office results were not that huge, in part because it came out just as the coronavirus pandemic began. In spite of that the film did make $47 million on a $7 million budget so who knows. Perhaps we will see the mysterious Mr. Roarke once more. Until then this is one that movie that's a lot of fun, entertaining and worth watching.",Fantasy Island

Fantasy Island really reminded me of the live-action Scooby-Doo Movie from 2001 where the team go to Spooky-Island as both films are very similar & i liked that but of course this is a more adult version lol & it's a real treat.
I really liked the big beautiful tropical island setting with it's colourful sunny cinematography & gorgeous production design, so yeah the movie looks fantastic & the cast are all surprisingly good, watchable & very surprisingly likable!!! I cast is a fun bunch & the tone of the movie is silly fun & strange Horror but with a big dose of summertime adventure, it's a fun Comedy Mystery but not too silly & as the Mystery unfolds it gets abit more serious & threatening. Now we know the story as it's based on the 70's Cult t.v show about a group of people that go to the beautiful Fantasy Island to live out a personal Fantasy but things aren't as they seem & things get weird & creepy. The Fantasies get twisted & the island seems to be Magical & controls what happens to the people of the island & at first the film felt like a very early 2000's cheap DTV Thriller but it did get better & better in quality & story. There's nothing Amazing about the film but it's a great Summertime movie & a fun Retro Mystery Thriller.

The movie tells the story of five young adults who have won a contest to come to a magical island resort to make their wildest dreams come true. Two quirky half brothers dream of throwing a big party and having sexual intercourse with hot girls and guys, respectively. A lonesome woman regrets not accepting when her former boyfriend proposed to her five years ago and wants to change the past. A young man dreams of becoming a soldier and wishes he could save his father who was killed in action in Venezuela. A young woman wants to take revenge on a school bully who had terrorized her for years. All their dreams become true but soon take a sinister twist they didn't anticipate. The five protagonists soon realize that they have something in common. They must find out what that is in order to leave the island alive.This movie convinces in numerous departments. The story has multiple twists and turns that will make your head spin. The individual fantasies of the four groups of protagonists are diversified and entertaining. The locations are absolutely stunning and deserve the title Fantasy Island for sure. The movie mixes intense action sequences, gloomy fantasy elements and mild horror moments in a balanced way. The film has steady pace and entertains from start to finish. The film includes some interesting side characters such as the mysterious host of the island and a man who lives and hides on the island and seems to have his own agenda.On the other side, some of the characters are rather shallow, especially the two half brothers who seem to be rather dim-witted and only think about booze and sex. The film's horror elements aren't really spooky and the movie overall rather qualifies as quirky adventure flick. The story ends up having so many forced twists and turns that the viewers will end up being all confused in the final twenty minutes.Still, Fantasy Island is thoroughly diversified, entertaining and fast-paced. It's not the most creative, memorable and profound film but it never attempts to be that way and delivers the goods in the action, adventure and fantasy departments. Many people who rated this movie down obviously had wrong expectations right from the start. This movie isn't among Blumhouse greatest productions such as Happy Death Day, Insidious and The Gift but it's certainly better than Paranormal Activity, Truth or Dare and Unfriended. Fantasy Island is good for what it is.",Fantasy Island
48,Pairic,Darker Take on FI,6,13 March 2020,"Fantasy Island: Not at all as bad as some of the reviews suggest. Bit like an extended episode of The Twilight Zone. It's a far darker take on FI though, once your fantasy is set in motion it has to play out to it's end - only The Island knows what that end is. Wanting revenge on a school bully seems like a good idea until you realise an actual person is being tortured, shades of Saw and Hostel start to appear. Another fantasy involves enlisting in the army but the bullets turn out to be real. Things turn really whacky as the fantasies begin to coalesce. You get Zombies, evil doppelgangers, time travel and even water snakes. Perhaps one or two twists too many in the plot but Director/Co-Writer Jeff Wadlow delivers a watchable film and it has been a hit in spite of naysayers and COVID-19, made for $7 million, as of 12 March it has grossed $45.6 million. 6/10.",Fantasy Island

Truth or Dare, Ma, and now this. They're aren't good, but I seem to be able to find the fun in them. In this movie, five strangers arrive at Fantasy Island to have their wishes fulfilled. Each guest is then set up for something amazing. As things start to go wrong, I was still interested--I wanted to see where it was all going. The part that I think will bother people is act III, when you expect to get explanations for what's been going on. It's not very satisfying and makes no sense. I'm sure many will use the term ""lazy"" to describe what the writers came up with. Personally, I had low expectations and kind of knew what I was getting into, so I guess I got what I deserved. I can't really complain about that. But as far as recommendations go, this is only partially watchable. Even less coherent than Truth or Dare.",Fantasy Island

52,s3276169,Not Fantasy Island......,5,30 March 2020,"Having grown up with, amongst other things, the original TV series of Fantasy Island, anything that bears its name and its core proposition, is going to come under scrutiny.Suffice to say this film has little in common with the original series, aside from very superficial similarities. Ricardo Montalbán defined the original series with his mysterious larger than life personality. This film has its own Mr Rourke but there's none of Montalbán's magic on offer, literally and metaphorically.In its place is a very basic, by the numbers horror, that's not bad as such, its shake and bake entertainment, that's here today and then quickly forgotten.The cast includes a few actors I know from a few different tv series and to be fair, the quality of performances is acceptable if unremarkable.In short, a horror film that borrows elements of the TV series but has little, to nothing, in common with it.5/10.",Fantasy Island
53,aidanratesmovies,"It's a mess, although not exactly what I expected, which I guess, in some way, is good",4,26 September 2020,"Often incoherent, messy, but entertaining all the way through- Fantasy Island proves to be a decent watch if your able to turn your brain off for most of it, even though it never truly proves to be enjoyable in nearly any attempt. The acting in this film is rather typical for it being a horror movie, especially in the fact that almost no one sticks out. Besides the often awful performances from Lucy Hale and Ryan Hansen, not to mention the nearly pointless inclusion of Michael Rooker, everyone else fails to memorable- although Maggie Q, Michael Pena, and Austin Stowell do try their best. The script is incredible messy, tedious, and very illogical in every sense of the word. It is full of twists that are not only unbelievable, but require almost no convincing at all, which doesn't only seem lazy, but shows that they required no effort or interest in making any sort of quality film. I had fun watching this film, for the most part. There are, for sure, plenty of annoying moments throughout. J.D. and Brax's characters as brothers in the film seem like a bad SNL parody every time they are on screen, and the clash of tones between that, an army story, a revenge Saw-like story, and some creepy family scenario just don't seem to mix in any sense of the word. Its sheer audacity for believing that somehow all these mixed concepts will work together though does make for a entertaining and very interesting movie experience, even if it is in a rather ironic fashion. In the end, Fantasy Island is an odd remake of a classic tv show that doesn't seem to work on any accounts besides being rather fun in a bad sort of way. It's not scary, funny, or any of the other genres it tries to mix throughout, but it's so uniquely bad in telling its own tale- that it does make for something you haven't seen before, which is something I suppose.
My Rating: 4.5/10",Fantasy Island
54,questl-18592,Lazy Island,3,19 February 2020,"From Blumhouse studios comes a movie high in concept but low in delivery. Imagine a fantastical island that can make your deepest desire come true, but be careful what you wish for. The film explores notions of regret and the cancer it can be in someone's life.Unfortunately, despite the attempt at a fun concept, this movie is lazy, clunky and poorly executed. At no point in the 109 minute runtime did I feel an ounce of tension or suspense. Plot movements feel forced and contrived without making any real sense. They film makes the mistake of trying to explain the magic and all that does is cause more problems.It also struggles from spreading itself too thin. There's half a dozen characters here that are split up right away and we jump back and forth between then, so much so that we never get the chance to really connect to any of them. If the film would've had more focus there could've been some level of investment in the characters.
There's also a significant number of moments that just look bad. The cinematography in this is awful. Too many times things just looked bad, whether it be from weirdly shaky shots or awful looking computer editing.The setting is pretty. Michael Pena is pretty much always enjoyable to me. And that does it for the positives.There's not much to this. I was never drawn in due to the clumsy storytelling and direction. Never had the chance to get caught up in the characters. For those that enjoy cheesy, bad horror movies, this could be fun but beyond that there's not much really here.",Fantasy Island
55,masonsaul,Weak horror movie,4,9 December 2020,"Fantasy Island is a weak horror movie that's dumb, contrived and convoluted, relying entirely on jump scares and ultimately failing to be scary or suspenseful. Michael Peña, Maggie Q, Lucy Hale and Jimmy O. Yang all give fine performances with Michael Rooker being the standout but massively underutilized. Jeff Wadlow's direction is sufficient for the most part but any action or fight sequence is cheap and incomprehensible. The music by Bear McCreary is good.",Fantasy Island
56,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Decent PG-13 Adaptation of Classic TV with Horror Elements,6,27 February 2020,"I'm going to be perfectly honest with you, I only went to see this film for my year end list and for my podcast. The last couple years I've tried to make sure I hit all of the 'major' releases in the theater to support the genre. I didn't have the highest hopes for this one, but I wasn't coming in to hate it either. I tried to come in expecting something similar to Happy Death Day, which I know was pretty polarizing, but I still thought that one was fun. The synopsis here is a horror adaptation of the popular '70s TV show about a magical island resort.Something I have to give credit for is that this movie doesn't waste any time getting into it. We start with seeing Sloane Maddison (Portia Doubleday) trying to escape from people that are pursuing her through woods. She emerges from them and we see she's on an island. She goes into the main house and the phone rings. She answers it to hear a man's voice before she's taken.We then have a seaplane arrive at this island. Disembarking from it are Gwen Olsen (Maggie Q), Melanie Cole (Lucy Hale), Patrick Sullivan (Austin Stowell), Brax Weaver (Jimmy O. Yang) and his brother J.D. (Ryan Hansen). They're met by Julia (Parisa Fitz-Henley) among other staff as they're led to the main building. Each is taken to their own room, except Brax and J.D. We then meet their host, Mr. Roarke (Michael Peña). He informs them that they'll all get their fantasy. The rules are that they only get one and that they need to allow it to play to its natural completion. Brax and J.D. are the only ones not taken to a room as their fantasy is starting now which is a wild party.The following morning Gwen meets with Mr. Roarke who inquires more about what her fantasy is. It ends up being to fix the biggest regret of her life as she doesn't feel she deserves happiness. This means going to the date where Allen Chambers (Robbie Jones) proposed and she turned him down. Melanie's is to punish a childhood bully who made her life a living hell. It turns out that her bully was Sloane and it goes darker than Melanie is ready to go. Patrick's fantasy is to be a soldier, as he wasn't allowed growing up. What he gets isn't necessarily what he's expecting when he comes face to face with Lieutenant Sullivan (Mike Vogel).All the while, we're seeing a specter that is disfigured as well as a wild looking man named Damon (Michael Rooker). The reason they're all there might not be what they were expecting and they all share something in common as it becomes a fight for survival from cartel members, soldiers and a monstrous man named Dr. Torture (Ian Roberts). There's also a secret within the island of how these fantasies are possible.Unlike many of my cohorts in the horror community, I don't despise PG-13 horror films. Not all of them need to ramp up the blood and gore to be effective. An example for me is Happy Death Day which does feel more like a comedy with slasher elements. I didn't think other movie was great, but it was fun. This one here is really taking slasher elements again, but mixing in adventure, fantasy and mystery. If you're not going to go hard R with the blood and kills, you really do need these secondary elements to work.To start with what I liked, there's a mystery and story underneath everything that is happening on the island. This connects all of the characters and I liked it. I will admit, I was starting to get bored until that plot really surfaced. That's where it caught my interest. Shifting slightly to a negative, there's really only one of these initial fantasies that are horror, being that Melanie is torturing her bully and a dark manifestation of a doctor that she dealt with as a child who she called Dr. Torture. The other fantasies do take this turn though as it progresses.The major issue I had though would be the pacing. This movie runs 109 minutes and I think that's too long. What makes it wild though is that as it doesn't take long to get into it. We get to see the fantasies of all of the characters before they start to play out in ways they weren't expecting. The problem becomes it takes too long to get into what's brought them together and the truth. I lost interest and didn't really find things all that interesting in the second act until it all collides. It does pull me back though and I thought the ending was fine. It has a nice little nod to the original show, but I've never seen that so I had to look it up to understand. This is slightly problematic as this is directed toward a younger audience. I don't know if you're get to get a lot of people in the cinema or to see this that enjoyed the original show or its remake so it could be lost on them. You're also not going to get my age group or younger to use this as a reason to watch the shows either.What I will give credit here to is the actors and their performances. I'm a fan of Peña and thought he was fine for this role. He does play it cryptic which makes sense for the island he works at and what he's doing to progress the story. Maggie Q feels like the most accomplished aside from him and that would make her the other star. The problem with having four main characters though is that they do disappear for stretches. She's brooding with her past and it works. I was actually really impressed with Hale here. She's quite forward to start out with, which is different from her role in Truth or Dare. There's more to her as we learn more about her past. I thought Stowell was fine along with Doubleday, Yang and Hansen. I did like the cameos by Rooker, Vogel, Kim Coates, Roberts, Jones and Goran D. Kleut as well.That will take me to the effects here. To be honest, they're a bit light. We do get some CGI, but they actually don't go all that heavy. It's usually used to make someone's eyes go dark, some smoke as well as having people disappear before they're seen. This of course being hallucinations so I'm willing to allow that. So overall this is not a big deal and doesn't really affect anything where I was bothered. Being this is a PG-13 film, it's lighter on blood as well. They do have some guns here, so they can avoid things there. I would say that the cinematography is fine overall.Now with that said, I never try to come into a movie to hate it before I've seen it. This does do some good things for sure. I like the underlying mystery of the movie. I think the reveal of the truth is good and incorporating a bit of supernatural elements as well. The acting is solid across the board and I don't really think any issues with the effects. This does run a bit long which caused me to lose interest a bit. The soundtrack really didn't stand out, but it also didn't hurt my opinion either. If you like these Blumhouse type films, give it a viewing. It's not bad and would say that my rating here is just slightly over average.",Fantasy Island

Fantasy Island falls into the trend of making a superficial movie that has all the gleam to attract you with little sustenance to keep you nourished. It's a great opening horror movie for the younger generation to wet their feet, as it attempts to get some relatable issues on the table, add a small amount of character depth, and still give the ""thrill"" of the chase. Yet where the movie falters is in its ability to really tie this adventure together, managing to put a twist into the film, but not in the artful form to pull everything together. Even worse, the movie's rushed ending and lack of scares just makes this an MTV television series with a more bloated budget. While the performances do their best to handle the characters, there is not enough meat to this islands presentation to say it's the best horror movie, but there are enough special effects gimmicks that can make a night out with friends worth the theater visit.

58,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Fantasy Island,6,20 February 2020,"""Da plane! Da plane!"". That's the famous quote from the 70's television series Fantasy Island. Now over forty years later, we have Fantasy Island the movie. Fantasy Island the movie is like the PG-13 rated horror version of the TV show. I also got a sort of tingling, Twilight Zone/Flatliners vibe as I watched it.2020's Fantasy Island contains actors you thought were kinda out of the business at this point (Maggie Q., Michael Rooker, Kim Coates). Fantasy Island also makes these actors seem goofy while they play down to their forgone potential. The film is about five linked people who visit a fictitious island only to have their fantasies turn into wretched nightmares.Campy, creepy, stupidly humored, tone confused, and lushly story boarded (at least until the final act), Fantasy Island entered theaters this month with little hype, little marketing, and a kind of dated approach. It's eerie fun for most of the way though and it's a long shot but the midnight movie circuit might be calling Fantasy Island in years to come.Directed by a guy known for action and/or horror flicks (Jeff Wadlow) and garnering a running time of 109 minutes, Fantasy Island is kinda wishy-washy about what it really wants to be. For my money, it's outmoded tripe for anyone nostalgic about the late Ricardo Montalban (or the late Herve Villechaize). It's also B-movie tripe for anyone who dug the revised movie versions of Charlie's Angels, CHiPs, and/or Baywatch.Helmer Wadlow fashions Fantasy Island as a fast-paced mutt of a film with twists and turns thrown in just for the heck of it. He likes to pull the rug out from underneath you but it feels like it's strictly for show.""Dear Mr. Fantasy"", I liked various moments of savage buffoonery in Fantasy Island but I'm giving it a rating of 2 and a half stars.",Fantasy Island
59,Kamurai25,"""Lost Island""",5,15 September 2020,"Decent watch at best, could watch again, but probably won't, and can't sincerely recommend.I had to watch this twice to make sure I followed what happened, I thought it was because I was really tired the first time, but nope, it made about as much sense the second time.A lot of this is just the writing. I don't know what is with writers and mysterious islands (I'm looking at you, ""Lost""), but it makes them crazy: just because ANYTHING could happen, doesn't mean it needs to. The problem with ""Lost"" is that they were actively reacting to viewer reactions, trying extremely hard to produce episodes that didn't match predictions (allegedly keeping the audience guessing), but that just makes disjointed story lines that wildly diverge for no reason. This movie is basically that happening all in one go.The reason that the audience can draw lines is because a pattern is established by the written story, diverging breaks that pattern; it does not enhance it.This movie keeps some movie mystery clues in there, but there is a LOT of wild diverges and acting within acting here that I can't elaborate on without spoiling it (it's the one ""great"" thing about this movie, so I won't). There is a high quality way of writing that involves red herrings and proper misdirection, but this is not it. The end result looks the same, until you review what happened and realize that the first was based off the information given and the second is based off of arbitrary writing decisions.The mystery of the island itself interferes with the traditional mystery aspect as well. Even in ghost mysteries there are rules to follow. When there aren't any rules left, you can't predict and the story actually gets boring if not frustrating.I am not saying this movie is without worth, but I am going to say that I feel bad for Lucy Hale as she's definitely the best of this movie.",Fantasy Island

I saw this in 4k HDR for 99 cents on google play and loved it. If you're a fan of the show, there are traces of it in this film, which in the unrated version is not for kids.

This isn't nearly as bad as what it is made out to be. 2. It for nearly half of the time IS a horror & in fact is a ""horror"" take on the 1970's TV under the same name.A group of young adults go to a remote island named ""Fantasy Island"" to experience their desired fantasies. But all is not what it seems, their fantasies seem to turn dark & twisted & who or what is behind it remains to be seen by the participants.I found the film to be good. Not amazing, but good all the way. The horror elements were there & the sinister feel was felt. The twist at the end was surprising. The gore could've been more & well the potential for more horror & scares could've been more in-your-face, but hey.Overall, definitely worth a watch. 7/10",Fantasy Island

63,m-47826,High expectations completely crushed. Messy yet simplistic script.,3,23 October 2020,"I'll rest my case. Blumhouse is ruining the horror genre. When it's not pushing agendas and political statements, it's simply missing the mark by being unnecessarily comical or dramatic. Sappy even, when it comes to this movie in particular. I genuinely enjoyed it at first, and was ready to give it a fair shot. Only the moment the horror aspect was supposed to be on overdrive. I got bored and disappointed. There's no tension. Nothing really important happens in this movie. And the re-reading of Greek mythology meets Scream, explaining the « why » of the situation, is pretty silly. Another thing I didn't like was the kill count. Close to nonexistent. Maggie Q has the most interesting and compelling character in the movie, and Lucy Hale really improved her acting since her Pretty Little Liars days. Only male characters storylines were those that bored me the most. On one hand you have the comic reliefs, and on the other, the tortured souls. Hardly something to keep you invested. As for secondary characters, they just blend into the background. Which is for the best, and the whole point, I guess. You can risk yourself at it, only don't expect a horror movie. More like adventure, drama and fantasy, of course.",Fantasy Island
64,arungeorge13,Lazy writing spoils it! [+34%],3,15 April 2020,"From a storytelling perspective, the film descended into a giant mess from the moment each of the lead characters' fantasies started to get twisted. The narrative gets convoluted, the motive(s) lack conviction, and that late twist (gosh!) was disastrous, to say the least. I haven't seen the original show that the film is based on, but it's safe to say that it must have been a lot more entertaining than this drivel.Michael Pena and the entire ensemble seem miscast in the flick. Talented actors like Maggie Q, Lucy Hale, and Michael Rooker are wasted in badly written roles. The few positives include the beautiful Fiji locales and the somewhat intriguing first act. I think Jeff Wadlow's intention was to turn this into a less creepy, more sandboxy version of The Cabin in The Woods and Lost (a weird blend indeed!). The stories of the individual characters become less hard-hitting with each line they utter and every passing scene.By the time we get to the finale, the screenplay has run out of solutions to keep you entertained. So, you get a makes-zero-sense twist that rescinds much of the build-up. I'm not sure you want to risk watching this!",Fantasy Island

68,rivertam26,Ambitious but sloppy and dumb,4,18 February 2020,"So I just saw this flick and boy was it a mess. This reimagining of the classic TV show is confused, silly, sloppy but ambitious trainwreck. It centers around a group of strangers who are given a free vacation and an opportunity to have their greatest fantasies granted, no matter how dumb they are. They of course become nightmares and the group of goofy characters must try and escape before they die. Director/Writer Jeff Wadlow of the awful Truth or Dare should be given props for trying to be ambitious and spotlighting a gay asian character. But the film feels so confused. It doesn't know what it wants to be, never brings anything to a satisfying fruition and doesn't commit to anything. I feel most of this us because of studio tampering, test screenings and most likely an unfinished script and a looming release date. The end result is a goofy, confusing film that at times feels more like a drama than a horror film or thriller. It all culminates with a ridiculous twist that makes even less sense than anything that has come before it. I appreciated that the makers tried to do something new they just don't have the talent or creativity to pull it off. I actually thought it was something totally different and much better than what I was presented on screen. That being said I didn't hate it but its another entry in an already rough year for the genre.",Fantasy Island

Not a bad way to spend 2 hours",Fantasy Island
70,Stephen_A_Abell,An Enjoyable Film... Even Though There's Flaws In Story And Direction...,6,25 April 2020,"Fantasy Island is a very enjoyable watch though there's trouble with both the story and direction.I liked that the writers, Jillian Jacobs, Christopher Roach, and Jeff Wardlow (who also directed), gave the audience the cause of the Island's power. The mystical and magical Black Water. In revealing this tidbit, give the audience more questions.Unfortunately, they also give the viewers a mess of a storyline. Within that story, they also injure the character of Mr Roarke. In the TV series, Mr Roarke was a cool and classy embodiment of the Island. They try to bring this to the film, then they try to make him human by introducing his wife. However, if he truly loved his missus as much as he claimed, would he compel her to his fantasy... forever? This makes him selfish and self-centred, and it doesn't work. This character needed mystery. Not everybody needs an origin story.Though, I am happy with Tattoo's introduction.The worst part of the story is the reveal over the first true fantasy. This would mean the character gets two fantasies. The second fantasy then becomes a sham; it's to confuse the viewers and the characters victims. The writers needed to flag this up for a rewrite. All it needed was a few structural changes in the story. It's an unforgivable error, especially with three writers.It's also one reason the film seems too long. It would play better with ten minutes removed. Wardlow could've shortened the overlong scenes. Both ""the cave"" and ""Tattoo & JD"" segments had such scenes. The tension and excitement would've improved at these points. Sadly, there were a few moments I found myself yawning.However, the chief drawback for me was the opening sequence. This has such an amateurish quality to it, with bad angles and nasty shaky camera work. I immediately doubted my enjoyment for the rest of the movie. To start a film in this manner is poor.Luckily, though, this is the worst-case in the film. However, more innovativeness throughout would have strengthened the movie.The best thing Wardlow gives the viewers is the vivid technicolour Island. It adds an overly beautiful ""chocolate box"" elegance to the film. This is truly paradise. It's the perfect way to frame the Island.As for the acting, Michael Pena as Mr Roarke is a failure. Pena is a good actor. I believe the reason behind his failure is that of the writing and direction of the character. Ricardo Montalban created the perfect host in the TV Series. So you either keep that image or go completely in the opposite direction. Pena might have been able to handle the mysterious Montalban image. For this persona, though, I think I would go with Danny Trejo, Luis Guzman, Jimmy Smits, or David Zayas.The rest of the cast work well in their personalities. Though Michael Rooker as Damon is under-used. Damon needed a few more scenes to root him into the story fuller. Make him a tad more solid for the audience. He's just a throwaway character to drive the plot.This movie could've been everything everybody was expecting. All it needed was a little more attention and love from the writers and director. Even though there are two horror elements, the doctor and the torture chamber, this is not a horror film. At best, I'd call it a dark fantasy adventure. So if that genre floats your boat then sail across to Fantasy Island... you may enjoy your stay.It is an enjoyable film and I will watch it again, though not soon. If you're still on lockdown, then this is one way to waste a couple of hours.Ratings:

Yes it's extremely cheesy at times and the film effectively makes up the rules as it goes along but if you don't overthink it and go into it as a higher budget fast paced B movie you'll most likely enjoy it.,Fantasy Island

73,hnt_dnl,Better than it had any right to be,7,9 March 2020,"Went into the theatre knowing FANTASY ISLAND (2020) had gotten this very low rating, so of course I expected it to be awful. Well, it really wasn't. Ironically, this movie remake/reboot of the iconic late 70s-mid 80s TV series had a lot of similarities to that show. I say ironic because, frankly, many reboots of popular TV series fail to do that very thing. They tend to go their own way in trying to be completely different and in many cases, they end up awful. And despite the below-5 rating, Fantasy Island is actually not awful.Now, don't get me wrong, there are definitely some weaknesses with this film, most notably some of the characters are very annoying. In particular, I found the jabberjawed millennial Melanie and the two partying 13-going-on-30 stepbrothers to be extremely overbearing. The 2 brothers were supposed to be this comedy duo, but most of their jokes fell flat. The best charactrers were Roark, Julia, and Sloane. Also, Gwen and Patrick were cool characters and I thought their fantasies were well done.The film did a reasonably good job of intermingling horror with human subplots, something that the original series did as well. In fact, the series started out as a very dark, twisted, horror piece before it turned into a rather campy popcorn entertainment as it wore on in it's later seasons. What really surprised me about this movie is that most of the emotional beats actually worked and in fact were the best aspects of it. I actually cared about most of the characters and was rooting for things to work out for them. Maybe my 7 rating is a tad lofty, but I think it deserves it for some generally good acting, clever dialogue, likable characters, and a pretty satisfying ending.",Fantasy Island
74,one9eighty,Welcome to fant... actually... Welcome to Hell!,6,17 December 2020,"When a group of people turn up to a resort called Fantasy Island they are under the pretense that their stay will be the best holiday of their lives. While staying as guests on Fantasy Island, their deepest desire will play out in reality and they will get what they truly want. Initially everything seems to be blissful until one by one, the guests fantasies turn into nightmares until they are fighting to survive for their lives.This film is directed by Jeff Wardlow, who, along with Chris Roach and Jillian Jacobs, also does the writing on it. For anyone too young to know, this film is loosely inspired by a TV series by the same name which ran between 1977 and 1984 which starred Ricardo Montalban and Hervé Villechaize. The TV series wasn't as dark as this film, but the plot is similar; guests turn up to have their fantasies fulfilled, but it's not always as it seems to be and often tests the strength of their character. To make things darker, inspiration was taken from ""Cabin in the Woods"" (2011) and the ""Westworld"" TV series (2016 - present). In this modern take on it, the Mr Sloan character played by Montalban is still present and played by Michael Peña. Villechaize's character of Tattoo in the original is also present here, but it's not made obvious till later in the film so I won't spoil it.There is a decent enough cast in the film, I've already mentioned Michael Peña who does well in the leading role. There is also Maggie Q, Lucy Hale, Austin Stowell, Jimmy O. Yang, Ryan Hanse, and Michael Rooker (to name a few) also thrown into the mix. They all perform ok, even if some of their characters aren't necessarily written as deep and engaging - some in fact are written as stereotypical avatars of what could be seen as cool, or what could be seen as an ideal family unit. As far as the character writing is concerned, I had a bit of an issue with the Melanie character (Lucy Hale) - without spoiling anything too much, the audience follow her and see her panicking and fearing for her life. She can be seen talking to herself while she tries to escape. Heck, she even comes up with the escape plan. By the end of the film, without spoiling it, I was wondering if that wasn't a massive plot hole. There were some other instances of lazy writing which kind of annoyed me too (the source of the fantasies mainly), particularly with some of the other plot twists - but again, I'm not going to start listing them all. What I will say is, that while this isn't an Oscar worthy film, it is fun still.All in all I think I would recommend this as a decent enough film to pass the time. I think it's under rated and from what I've read on film websites, I think it's been panned unfairly by a demographic of audience that need things explained, or have to have super glitzy blockbusters. There are enough nod's to the original material, but this has been adapted well enough for a modern audience with good aesthetics and pacing. There a few instances of lazy writing which make certain things lack depth and appear a little predictable, but overall there is enough fun to keep you entertained. I can see a sequel to this being spawned, just maybe not with the same good casting due to the ratings this film is unfairly getting by keyboard warriors online. You can do a lot worse than watch this 2020 film.",Fantasy Island
75,rockman182,Fantasy Island (2020),5,16 February 2020,"I have never seen the TV show that this was based on but I did scratch my head that they were making an update to it and also hearing that it would be more horror. Okay. Then I was having more doubts knowing that it was from Blumhouse, the director of Truth or Dare, and the lead actress from Truth or Dare, Lucy Hale. I was hoping for something semi decent because honestly the premise sounds interesting and with good writing it could be a nice little niche horror. I'm sad to report that this film is terrible.
The film is about a group of contestants who win a trip to a place called Fantasy Island. On this island the groups get to explore their greatest fantasy and act on it, almost as if it is happening in real life. The ""keeper"" of the island Mr Roarke, explains the island and soon each of the contestants start to live out their fantasies. Soon they realize that the outcomes of their fantasies are horrifying and there are dark secrets abound on this island where escape seems unlikely.
When the film started I was hoping for the best. Its an interesting plot for sure. However, as minutes passed by and a pair of contestants kept high fiving each other and dropping ""bro"" jokes and references I wasn't so sure anymore. The film drops so bad in quality as it progresses. The film fails as a horror film immediately because all the ""scares"" are done exactly when you expect them to turn up. The acting is pretty bad. Pena disappoints and I think Lucy Hale has always been terrible in everything. The twists that they keep pulling in this film are so bad especially the final fifteen minutes where the plot keeps changing.
The tone is absolutely all over the place. You get a war scene and people dying and then switch Maggie Q relaxing on the beach relaxing with her fake daughter. Also, the amount of times they try changing the fantasies and try guessing whose fantasy they are in, good grief its over plotted and extremely messy. It makes up rules as it goes along and makes less sense as it goes along. Had to roll my eyes at the end. This might be marginally worse than Truth or Dare, which was awful.4.5/10",Fantasy Island

77,RforFilm,This is one fantasy you don't want to see to it's natural conclusion. Fantasy Island is too long and it's plot is too complicated,4,20 February 2020,"We've all been asked the question of in case we ever encountered a genie, then what would our wishes be. The moral of most of these stories is that the wishes never come out like the wisher had in mind. Perhaps they wanted a million dollars, but when they got the pile of money, it turned out to come right from a bank who reported it missing. Or maybe they wished to be a very powerful person, and they ended up becoming a drug lord. Wishes gone wrong have been subject to a lot of movies and television. One example was from the popular 70s/80s show Fantasy Island.Fantasy Island took new guests that would arrive to fulfill whatever fantasy they desired. The wishes were engineered by the island's keeper, Mr. Roarke, who told guests they had to see their fantasies through their natural conclusion. Though I haven't seen a lot of it, the show made for an eerie, Twilight Zone type feeling in which lessons would be learned, but all within this tropical paradise. There's even an underlying darkness that has potential to be further explored. It's too bad they got the wrong people to handle the movie adaptation of Fantasy Island.Several people have won a contest where the prize is a free trip to Fantasy Island. The winners include a businesswoman Gwen Olsen (played by Maggie Q), officer Patrick (played by Austin Stowell), stepbrothers J.D. (played by Ryan Hansen) and Brax (played by Jimmy O. Yang), and troubled young woman Melanie (played by Lucy Hale). They are astound by the islands beauty and are eager to take advantage of the ""fantasy"" aspect, despite having no cell service or internet. Their greeted by Mr. Roarke (played by Michael Peña) who tells them they have to see the fantasy to their natural conclusion.With Melanie's fantasy, she's getting revenge on a childhood bully who she says ruined her life. In Patrick's fantasy, he gets his chance to enlist in a combat war and serving with the troops. In J.D.'s and Brax's fantasy, they now have the mansion of their dreams and they party. In Gwen's fantasy, she gets a second chance to say yes in a marriage proposal she initially rejected. As they do, they all go wrong as each guest tries to make heads and tails of what's going on. This leads them to dive deeper into the island, figure out Mr. Roarke's intentions and see how everything works.It seems like that director Jeff Wadlow (Truth or Dare) wanted to take the show Fantasy Island and mix it with themes from Lost and Westworld, which isn't a bad idea, especially if done with the right kind of horror. In fact, for the first part, I'm even drawn into some of the ideas...with the keyword being some. The fantasies with the brothers and Melanie aren't that interesting and predictable. But the fantasies involving Patrick and Gwen do carry a lot of weight within their personas and how their connected to the island. It's too bad most of the movie really falls apart after forty-five minutes.I'm not sure why the script had prepared it in this manner, but in an attempt to connect all the guests, the plot get way too complicated and pretentious. They'll refer to a fire that had everyone involved, but when the movie reveals whose significant other died, you almost forgot that they were referenced to at all. Plus, many of the characters, including Mr. Roarke, are too unlikable to sympathize with. They all seem to have troubled pasts, but the movie is more focused on scaring you then trying to draw an emotional connection.Speaking of which, this movie barley qualifies as a horror. I'd count this as more of a fantasy-thriller, but even that feels very tame compared to other R rated materiel we've had recently.Casting wise, the movie is spotty with that. Players like Maggie Q, Austin Stonwell and Michael Rooker do fine, but everyone else is either over-the-top or giving the minimum for a performance. Unfortunately, as much as I like Michael Peña, he was miscast for Mr. Roarke, who doesn't come off charming or enchanting enough. They really needed a George Clooney or Antonio Banderas.I'll give this four Fantasy Island TV show dvds out of ten. Except for some nice scenery, there's not much I can recommend as even the running time feels too long for it's own good. This is one fantasy I wont see to it's natural conclusion.",Fantasy Island
78,Anurag-Shetty,Tries to mix too many genres.,7,15 February 2020,"Fantasy Island is a feature film re-imagining of the TV show of the same name that aired from 1977 to 1984. It takes place on an enchanting island, where your deepest desires come true.Fantasy Island is a good movie. However director Jeff Wadlow tries to infuse too many genres, into a single film. It tries to be an action-adventure, a comedy & a horror movie, all at once. This doesn't work, for the most part. The writers should have stuck to one main genre & built the other genres around that. There are several twists & turns that will keep you guessing, right till the end. The performances are the highlight of the film. Lucy Hale is spectacular as Melanie. Maggie Q is brilliant as Elena. Portia Doubleday is awesome as Sonja. Michael Rooker is unforgettable as Morgan. Michael Pena is outstanding as Mr. Roarke. Parisa Fitz-Henley is amazing as Julia. Ryan Hansen is great as Bradley.

Not like the actual skeleton crypt-keeper from the HBO's original series; But a sophisticated Latin man like Ricardo Montalban was. If they had only taken the time to really write each fantasy well with characters that had depth to them. But the makers botched up a great concept, unfortunately. This could have been a really great horror franchise if they had not gone for the quick buck and if had taken the time and love to build this film for the long haul with additional sequels.

At this point, I stopped watching and began observing, documenting how our civilization has fallen to the point that such blatant idiocy could be viewed by a mass audience.

85,msbreviews,"Fantasy Island is 2020's Serenity. The worst movie of the year, so far",1,13 February 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)First of all, no, I have no knowledge of the TV series this film is based upon, and after watching Jeff Wadlow's adaptation, I'm definitely not watching anything related to this story. I always follow this principle: the two pillars of any movie are its story and characters. It doesn't matter if everything else is absolutely perfect. If the two central pieces fail to convince the audience, then the whole movie falls to the ground. Sometimes, there are some crumbles that remain intact. Very rarely, there's a big segment that has no scratches whatsoever, which can help the film to survive and, even more rarely, actually make it ""okay"".Fantasy Island has two little crumbles named Portia Doubleday (Sloane) and Maggie Q (Gwen), who deliver good performances, especially the former who everyone knows from one of the best TV shows of all-time, Mr. Robot. Everything else is completely destroyed. The Grudge still has a couple of redeeming moments, but Fantasy Island is undoubtedly the worst movie of the year, so far. The before-mentioned two pillars are built with the most annoying, cliche characters, as well as a ridiculous narrative that ultimately brings the whole thing down.The third act possesses some of the most nonsensical, irrational, and illogical plot twists I've ever witnessed. This is 2020's version of Serenity, also a movie with an absurd twist that only turns the film even worse than what it was. The big difference between the two plot twists is that Serenity's was predictable from the get-go. Fantasy Island's last twenty minutes are profoundly unexpected because no sane soul would have thought of such a baffling narrative decision.The best way to describe the twist without spoiling a thing (and I won't) is through the editing. During the exposition-heavy revelation, the editing is so awkwardly choppy that it made me think it was all fake. I genuinely thought the plot twist was a false sequence. When I realized it wasn't, I simply laughed like a maniac because I couldn't believe someone thought this made logical sense. Usually, a plot twist carries some sort of build-up, even if it's literally a couple of minutes before the explicit revelation.This one just happens. Without any preparation, a character just shows up on the screen and begins explaining everything. It simply doesn't make any logical sense. It generates so many incongruencies with the whole story that I lost count of the plot holes I was able to point out. The film starts with establishing a few rules, only for an hour later to ignore or change them completely. A particular character acts a certain way without any plausible reason as to why. If the screenplay wasn't messy and confusing enough, the characters are also horribly-written.I never enjoy writing that an actor failed to do its job, but Ryan Hansen (JD Weaver) is the weak link of the cast, even if every single script is dreadful. Even the casting doesn't make sense: Michael Peña as a dramatic Mr. Roarke? A character supposed to be serious and mysterious? It's Michael Peña! I don't want to insinuate that he can only do comedy, but making him the villain (if I can call him that) is another addition to the list of questionable production decisions. Lucy Hale (Melanie) is fine as the protagonist, but it all comes down to the lazy, unimaginative scripts. Everything is so unbelievably messy that I don't even have any sort of technical remarks... Maybe that the beginning of the film and the actual concept look interesting. That's the only compliment I can think of: it wasn't a bad idea (different fantasies, different genres, it could have been a fun mix of styles).Fantasy Island is undoubtedly the worst film of the year until now. Consider it 2020's version of last year's Serenity, but with a third act's plot twist that is so unexpected, everyone will have their jaws on the floor due to how nonsensical it is. The story wasn't close to being decent until the revelation, and it only turned into something a lot worse after it. Dozens of incongruencies and massive plot holes are generated due to the ridiculous attempt at a Shyamalan-like twist. If the absurd narrative decisions aren't enough, the horrible character scripts don't help the not-that-great acting, with the exception of Portia Doubleday and Maggie Q, the only good aspects of the whole movie. In the end, the two pillars of any movie (story and characters) are a total failure, making everything else fall apart with no possible salvation.Rating: F",Fantasy Island

87,CANpatbuck3664,Interesting Idea but it Doesn't Add up to Much,4,27 March 2021,"I had never seen the original show but after reading about it a little, they decided to go a very different route with this (perhaps this isn't surprising given its a Blumhouse picture). The 2020 version is definitely a horror/thrilller and if I can say something positive about this movie, I appreciated the change and the decision to try something new. There's a lot of potential with the idea, twisting someone's innermost desires into a living nightmare. Its been done before but I've yet to see someone fully capitalize on the monkey's paw idea (see Wonder Woman 1984 for another failed attempt). I can't say they were the ones to succeed where so many others failed but I'll credit the screenwriters for putting a new twist on this property when they could have just rehashed it.While the direction the movie goes is different, its still not fully realized or done well. This script doesn't just have plot holes, it has plot craters. There's a few twists and turns and while the movie dips its toe in and out of the stupid pool throughout the runtime, when we reach the finale, it just gives up and cannonballs in. Most of the characters are either uninteresting or poorly written but I did find some kernels here and there. While the development of Melanie is iffy, I do think they pose some interesting questions about how damaging being a victim of bullying can be and how that can have a lasting affect on you and colour your perception of your life. I'd also say the same about Gwen with the deep nature of her regret. But they can't avoid inching those characters to sentimentality or even conventionality and at the end those questions are an afterthought for whatever they decided to replace them with (shlocky plot twists).Fantasy Island doesn't feature a heavy hitting cast but it was a nice pull to get Michael Pena in the Ricardo Montalban role. The problem is that Michael Pena (who I'm a big fan in most other things) is sleepwalking through this entire movie. I don't know if he's being deliberately deadpan but there's no energy in his work at all. Maggie Q is fine as Gwen, she's a victim of the plot bait and switch like all the other actors and actresses. Jimmy O. Yang and Ryan Hansen are miscast, Ryan Hansen especially is about 10 years too old to be playing this part and I don't want to blame them for flailing around and trying to make something happen when there's little there. Kim Coates and Michael Rooker show up in supporting parts where they're just required to rehash other characters they've done. Austin Sowell is also done few favours by the script but I thought he was pretty bad. Lucy Hale seemed like the member of the cast that bought in the most, she's trying to sell her character turn as much as she can (she also collaborated with Wadlow on another disappointment Blumhouse's Truth or Dare) but she's undercut by how ridiculous the movie gets.Interesting idea or not, the 2020 version of Fantasy Island is under cooked and disappointing at best. It also looks cheap, this isn't surprising for Blumhouse as most of their movies are done on shoestring budgets. I can't even be that enthusiastic about saying good try because they could have fixed it with a better script and more attention to detail. I can't recommend this on any level, even as a so bad its good kind of movie. There's better bang for your buck out there, you can skip a trip to Fantasy Island.",Fantasy Island

89,Beejerman,CHEER! - (7 stars out of 10),7,24 August 2020,"The stage curtains open ...Although I was never a big fan of the television show by the same name when I was a kid, I remember watching it from time to time and enjoying it. So, based on that and the trailer to this new film, I decided to give it a chance. I'm glad I did. Despite all of the negative reviews for this movie, I felt that ""Fantasy Island"", in short, delivers a fun, entertaining hour and 49 minutes.We are whisked away to a beautiful, tropical island setting where 5 individuals arrive by plane with the promise that they will be able to live out their own personal fantasy. They are greeted by their host, Mr. Roarke (Michael Peña), who informs them that the only rule is that they must follow their fantasy through to its natural conclusion. It all starts out innocent enough, but when things start to get a little too real, the guests of the mysterious island find themselves running for their lives. They don't know who or what they can trust, not even Mr. Roarke, since he obviously has a hidden agenda.Serving as a prequel to the television series, this has been toted as a supernatural horror - far from it! It plays out more as a supernatural thriller with aspects of escapism thrown in. Based on that, I think many of the reviewers were critical of ""Fantasy Island"" for its lack of scares, which is true. However, it had a fun story, and overall, the development of the characters were good and the end result satisfying. The acting was pretty bland here, in fact, Michael Peña, didn't even seem to care. But, we did get a nice turn from Maggie Q, who's character was really the only one with true depth in the film. The strength of the movie is it's plot and cinematography.I would recommend this film to anyone who isn't looking for perfection, and who isn't too critical. Each person's fantasy was interwoven and it was fun watching how it all came together at the end. The television series did last for 7 seasons, so there was draw and appeal, but even those weren't all that great. Perhaps it is the idea behind the movie that is the most appealing here. Even so.

You may like it the first time around, however, since I did (just not as much as now).Looking forward to a sequel, but the sequel would have to be as high quality as this one (and by high quality I mean both having a well-known cast and an overall high quality movie, as they did in this one).At first I didn't like that the island was magical and thought they should have gone with a more human-centered approach (like the first girl's fantasy), and while I still think and believe that, the magical aspect of it isn't that bad. I never saw the original show so I don't know if the island was originally magical or not.At the end of each day I need a new theatrically released movie to watch, or I'm not too happy.

91,johannes2000-1,Disappointing.,4,10 July 2020,"Okay, I guess a horror-version of former and more or less iconic 70'ties television-series Fantasy Island could be fun, but in 2020 you have to come up with some pretty good stuff to make it interesting for nowadays audiences. Unfortunately they didn't really deliver. I guess the biggest problem was that what in the beginning looked like an inventive and deadly set-up by a creepy machiavellistic host, gradually turned out to be in fact something supernatural, with all kinds of silly consequences, like unkillable creatures, people resurrected from the death, someone having to fight her own mirror image, etcetera. To me it kind of took the punch out-off the premise. Add to this that there were hardly any real scares or horrifying things: the torture-scene was rather quickly done with, the scenes with the old lover and the dead but alive again father meant way too much uneventful talking and all the fuss with the two brothers being chased by masked hit-men turned into slapstick. The acting was reasonable by most of the characters, but the two brothers were pretty irritating.",Fantasy Island

93,danielmanson,Quite impressed on the whole,7,28 December 2020,"This quick review will be written by someone who has absolutely no idea on the 70s TV show and reviewing based on the film as a separate entity. And from this point of view, I don't think it's bad at all.Within the first 10 mins or so, you see this ""stupid and dumb"" stereotypes with the 2 brothers and this young blonde girl hitting on one of the guys and I'm thinking that this is going to be a silly, goofy horror. But it wasn't that at all and the film did a great job of changing my mind on the characters.What I enjoyed: The twists in the plot were something I massively enjoyed as they really were just not what I expected and the level of suspense is kept throughout. And the plot just as a whole I thought was just entertaining and kept me hooked in. Listen, at the end of the day this film won't win awards, nor is it some 10/10 class film, but it entertained me and that's what films sometimes should be about.There are a couple of plot holes, none were film changing or ruined anything, but it stops the film really going beyond a 7/10. To be honest I'm really surprised this is as low as it is. There is no way this should be in the 4s. Maybe having lower expectations made it better?Overall though, it's a nice, straight forward watch. Entertaining film with some nice twists along the way.",Fantasy Island
94,danielcereto,LOST in the island,4,23 April 2020,"I watched this movie because apparently it looks interesting even the low ratings. I like actors like Michael Pena (Narcos) or Kim Coates (Sons of Anarchy). But the low ratings this time are sadly true.
First, the movie has an interesting concept but it's ruined by poor acting. Sometimes it look like over acted and amateurish. I didn't care or feel anything for any of the characters.
Second, the movie concept itself it's pretty similar to the series LOST, but here the execution is terrible. No way about anything can be minimally understandable.
Last, the ending was a joke. I can't believe Hollywood is still doing cheesy unoriginal and unbelievable endings.
So, overall a pretty weak movie even the cast. Make yourself a favor and if you're in a lockdown like me, just go to watch or re-watch the series LOST.",Fantasy Island

Yang), J. D. Weaver (Ryan Hansen) came to Island for something they wish for anything like say I want a bunch 20 virgin girls then it happens if you made up character then it comes to life that's what it is and also it can bring you back time as well I started to like Melanie character she is being bullied at school also she was an bully she goes to torture room she tortures this girl she bullied Sloane Maddison (Portia Doubleday) is tied up on chair Melanie gets to torture her but then theirs doctor Torture who tortures people so Melanie somehow saves this chick when it gets to twist what was so point of saving her when you watch it you get what i mean, Maggie Q Gwen who wishes she needs an family but it comes true but end of day their not real at all. she wishes to ask something else like go back to time to save that guy at burning apartment building but she didn't and no one could saved him she feels bad for it I am like no one could saved him at all sadly so I don't understand why she feels like bad forthrew out rest of film was pointless dumb, it keep changes to other story to other witch it was SO annoying as hell I hated 2 brothers were annoying wasted cast like Michael Rooker & Kim Coates were not much in film to honest this hell of time waster film boring as hell film people went see this witch I don't understand why?

101,blackmamba99971,Appropriate ending,7,19 April 2020,"Fantasy Island was one of my favorite series during the seventies and eighties. Richardo Montalban who played O'Roark was a very debonair type of person and he shone through every episode. What most do not know about the story was that O'Roark was an earth bound immortal who granted fantasies for guests in order to figure out the answers to their own moral questions. Whether its regret, envy, jealousy and on and on for each person who has a unique view on life.There are many hints as to O'Roark's existence, which dates back to the bronze age or when Christ was crucified on the cross, and Cartaphilus was cursed to walk the planet before the crucifixion and after he struck Jesus as repentance for his sin. It's very possible that O'Roark was Cartaphilus.I remember one episode near the season ending, which clinched it all together where Roddy McDowell played his opposite opponent... The devil.
I don't recall the exact details on that episode but it all ended pretty much the same way. That the guests experienced their faith through tribulations or trials of fate and became more enlightened from it and nobody died.The movie was played out well. Not a lot of sudden impact scenes or jump scares to give the viewer that creepy feeling but some of the action was good. Cavern scene was - - or felt like it was too sterile, and the characters explaining to one another about who was doing what and why seemed too college slap stick.Other than the few flaws and the cliche zombies it was not a bad spring filler. The producers should have kept the theme the same just like the series. That O'Roark was Immortal on earth to help those in need, not some explorer who came across an island and made it his own with a sick wife. It does leave a slight bitter aftertaste.",Fantasy Island
102,alcantaraj-16594,NOT R-RATED,6,16 June 2020,"""Fantasy Island"" is okay. The film looked promising at the beginning, making the viewers think that it would be a fun, non-slasher-like horror movie similar to ""Friday the 13th."" But when the story got more complicated near the end of the second act, the film became meh. Besides that, the film has a terrible plot twist that was explained but contradicts some of the actions a characted made in the first act. Lastly, said twist made Michael Rooker's character pretty pointless. THIS MOVIE WOULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH BETTER IF IT WAS RATED R, with more violence and of course, sex (not being a pervert) given that IT'S FANTASY ISLAND.Also, Michael Pena didn't bother me at all. It may be because I never saw the tv series",Fantasy Island
103,docm-32304,Better Than Its Rating,7,30 October 2020,"I almost didn't watch this film because of the ratings and reviews. BUT...decided WTH, and it wasn't half bad. Yes, Michael Pena's performance was not the best, especially in the shadow of the former giant Ricardo Montalban. I tried not to compare him, but Pena really lacked the carriage that the island host would normally have. However, the other actors worked well and the story...albeit a little convoluted at times, was not too bad. Overall, I. would say that it was in keeping with the lessons learned feel of the original Fantasy Island series, just not as campy.",Fantasy Island

It was entertaining and very good. Not a great movie but I would watch it a again in a group setting.

105,Just-A-Girl-14,Fun horror action movie,7,20 January 2021,"I don't get the low rating. 4.9? Really?! It's not a 9 or a 10 but it definitely doesn't deserve 4.9!!
I'm giving it a 7. I think it's a fun little horror flick. I understood the plot. It's not complicated. A group of people get to an island that grants them their deepest wish. It has a lot of twists and turns. You don't always know who the bad guy is but that's what's fun about it. As Mr. Roarke said in the beginning ""fantasies rarely play out as you might expect"".
It's not a typical horror movie, kinda reminds me of ""Happy Death Day"" (although not as great, I really loved that movie!) but if you're into horror movies, give this one a chance. It's a fun popcorn movie to watch with friends. Don't expect it to be a masterpiece, it's not but if you watch it with the right mindset, you'll enjoy it.One tiny thing though, and it's not really a spoiler cause I'm not telling you who said that and why but I really hate it when movies use cliches like the never ending sentence ""all you can do now is forgive yourself"". If you hurt someone and there's no way to fix it, you shouldn't ""forgive yourself"", you should remember that forever and make sure never to do it again. That sentence makes we want to throw up! I really hate it. Writers, please stop using it!",Fantasy Island

Sorry but the twist was awful ruined the movie I dont think there was a need for the twist.

107,TwistedContent,Flat Island - Welcome to a Numbingly Conventional & Witless Adventure,3,15 April 2020,"Admittedly, I have no knowledge of the original source material this is based off, the 70's (1977) tv-series of the same name. What I do know, however, is that Blumhouse's vision of it is a conventional and tedious lackluster. Jeff Wadlow's previous - ""Truth or Dare"" - I consider one of the worst horror movies Blumhouse has had to offer. Sadly, ""Fantasy Island"" lands right beside it.Months ago, the trailer already put it in the ""not excited for"" pile of movies, but I was ready to give it a chance as soon as it gets VOD'd - the cast is quite alright, concept has some intrigue & it's just a big-budgeted horror flick. And so it came around, and so it will be forgotten. ""Fantasy Island"" is about a variety of card-board characters landing on Fantasy Island, hosted by the mysterious Mr. Roarke, who, having the reigns over the mystical powers of the island, makes a single fantasy come true for each of the guests. The first half, the most entertaining one (which is not saying much), soon breaks down in episodic nature as we follow each of the guests, their fantasy and confrontations with the island & Mr. Roarke. The other half leads to even more cliché and stupider decisions and twists. Pacing starts its suffering downfall right at the start, and your personal fantasy might just be to see the credits roll. With its 109 minute runtime, ""Fantasy Island"" overstays its welcome by a margin. Wadlow, together with the ""Truth or Dare"" writing team, has beaten all odds and succeeded at making another uninspired and dangerously dull horror movie almost entirely devoid of atmosphere or scares. The horror variables all fell flat, so did the comedy, intentional or otherwise. The cast did not manage to redeem much of anything, the characters were every bit as bad as any other department of the script. For the majority of the movie we go through each character's either trauma, insecurity or whatever else they want to get through. Eventually most of them do, sending a dry, flat and painfully familiar morale towards the viewer, one after another. It seems to be the entire point of the movie. Michael Pena felt a little confused as Mr. Roarke (Jason Blum wanted to cast Nicolas Cage as Mr. Roarke, perhaps a smarter choice, at least there would be some entertainment), Michael Rooker had just about nothing to do & the rest... were pushing their way through this borefest, alright. The visual design, all that 7 million garnish, did little to nothing to impress, the overall aesthetic might just be as uninspired as the plot. Even Bear McCreary's score seemed uninvested in this whole affair.Honestly, I'm almost frustrated at the fact how good this movie did at the box office, for it might cue Blumhouse to make more of these forgettable, basic and flat to an impressive level horror movies. It was a tough time to look for any value or silver linings, the verdict is such that I can't recommend this movie to anyone. And I watched what they called the more hopeful ""unrated"" version... My rating: 3/10.",Fantasy Island

Mistake. Mr Rourke was older, Micheal Pena Great but ? Then instead of FANTASY they tried to make it Horror ? Granted there are some good scenes and acting in there, they just need a better script for the Next one and Music. This a just a hunch but my guess is that many of the people involved in this project never even saw the original ? Also an even bigger mistake was targeting a Young audiences instead of Old.

Director: Jeff Wadlow
Starring: Michael Pena, Maggie Q, Lucy Hale, Austin Stowell, Jimmy o yang, Portia doubleday, Ryan Hansen, Michael Rooker, Parisa Fitz Henley etcOverall rating 7/100Fantasy island sees a group of people arrive on a island thinking it will be a vacation where they can live their greatest fantasises. But this doesn't turn out to be the case and their biggest fantasies turn into their biggest nightmares. Wow what an embarrassment of a film Fantasy island, it was beyond poor and I honestly struggled to find any positives.First of all, there was no character background and the characters were incredibly irritating. The characters were just thrown onto the island with no information about them whatsoever, so you instantly didn't care about them due to the lack of time they took to flesh out the characters before they got onto the island. And a large majority of the characters were terrible and irritating. Lucy Hales character was incredibly annoying, stupid and self-centred with no likeable qualities at all. The brothers were the most annoying characters in my memory. Annoying personalities, nothing likeable at all, with awful one liners and they were trying to be funny, but it was just incredibly awkward to watch them.Next the script was beyond poor and most of the performances were actually pretty bad as well. Wow where to start with the script, it made no sense. The lines that some of the characters came out with were so bad and cringey it made me laugh for all the wrong reasons. It felt like a poor first draft that should have been re written multiple times to get a half decent movie it just felt sloppy and unprofessional. And I have to say I thought most of the performances were actually poor. The performances were either clunky and not believable with none of the relationships feeling realistic. Or it just seemed like the actors didn't care and weren't trying to be good it was strange and shockingly poor.Now time for my very positives, firstly the only two performances that were half decent were Michael Pena and Maggie Q. Michael was actually fairly creepy in places and manipulated the other characters well. And Maggie Q actually tried in my opinion. I cared about her character and her emotion was the most believable out of all the characters. Next the cinematography was decent basically the island looked nice. And finally some of the characters fantasies were fairly interesting and were briefly explored well, the fantasies about having a family and revenge on a childhood bully as key examples that briefly worked for me.Now back to the negatives, there was poorly executed plot twists and to many lapses in the logic. Wow I appreciate the attempt at plot twists but it would have been nice if they were believable and actually made sense. The twists of why Michael Pena's character was stuck on the island and the real villain of the film made no sense whatsoever and made the film fall apart. There was just to many unexplainable moments that were not answered once again linking back to the poor script.My next two negatives would be the lack of character depth and development and my emotional disconnect to the film. Wow the film added no new elements to the characters throughout apart from the basic personality and one things from their past it was like they weren't trying therefore I cared about practically none of the characters, this also led me to have a complete emotional disconnect from the film. They tried to add emotional moments to Michael Pena's character that fell flat, they tried to add emotional moments about bullying for Lucy Hale's character it fell flat. And both of the deaths in the movie I didn't care about and they were poorly executed and rushed.My final two negatives would the films lack of tension or Jumpscares and its massive tonal inconsistencies. This film was supposed to be a tense horror film, but I was not tense at one point and I was not made jump even once. This was largely due to the poorly timed and predictable Jumpscares and lack of tension building just brief outbursts of what was supposed to be a tense scene. And the films tonal inconsistencies were crazy. I genuinely don't know what genre this film was supposed to be. It had elements from horror, thriller, comedy, action, sci fi and none of them blended well whatsoever therefore making it seem like multiple different versions of the same film put poorly together.Overall Fantasy island is an embarrassment of a movie. Which I struggled to find any positives to. It felt amateurish. Where no effort was made for the films tone, script, characters or even performances from actors making it the worst film I have ever seen.",Fantasy Island
113,gustheaffen,More watchable than many Blumhouse movies,6,21 August 2020,"For the most part this was entertaining. Yes the plot twists and turns became a little tedious. I could have done without most of the cave scenes toward the end where they all became separated and went through their own ordeals. They did have to add some annoying wokeness, after all you do need to have a gay character and of course that turns out to also be Tattoo. Overall it was entertaining enough and didn't bog down too much. The bar is set pretty low for these types of movies. Bloomhouse seems to produce 5 a month, many very unwatchable.",Fantasy Island
114,movieman6-413-929510,The team behind a small simple horror film tries to go bigger without success.,2,15 February 2020,"Fantasy Island is a new horror adventure film directed, partly written and produced by Jeff Wadlow, the director of Truth or Dare and Kick-Als 2. This film is inspired and intended as a restart of the TV series of the same name from the 70s.In the film, the mysterious Mr. Roarke (Michael Peña) people to come to his remote tropical resort. Here he promises his guests that he will help them achieve their dreams and fantasies. As the new guests from Mr. Roarke living their fantasies and dreams, they begin to realize that in addition to these good things they are also confronted with their nightmares on the island. The guests learn in this way that they have to solve the mystery of the island if they want to leave it alive again.This film was made by the same film team that made the film Truth of Dare in 2018. In this film she tried to turn a simple game into a scary horror film without success. With this new film they are now trying to turn something larger, such as an old TV series, into a horror film. This film is about the different storylines of the different guests who all live up to their imagination and then have to fight their nightmares. The story seems to be difficult to follow, because all of these separate story lines are a bit messy. That is why the script writers have probably chosen to explain almost every scene in the film over and over again, but instead of making it clearer this only makes the film more elaborate. The only thing that gets no real explanation in the film is the size of the film. In this way, the film ends up being long-winded and also an incredible film.This film is also not as strong as a horror film, because a little horror fan can predict when something scary is going to happen in the film. The sound often disappears to come back hard in the film and to serve as a simple jump scare.The acting is also done a bit exaggerated by most of the cast. Maggie Q is the only one of the cast who still has a reasonable storyline to follow that she is trying to make something of. Michael Peña has also been cast a bit wrong, because the Mr. Roarke character from the TV series was portrayed by Ricardo Montalban and in the continuation of the TV series by Malcolm McDowell a bit more in a dark and sinister way. Michael Peña's version of this character is more like the character of Rowan Atkinson from the first Scooby Doo movie.",Fantasy Island
115,bangel3322,Major Flaws,5,12 March 2020,"With an idea like this, there are so many avenues one can take in order to create something spectacular, intense, scary and mind bending. Unfortunately this film did not possess any of these traits. It's more of a comedy than thriller or horror and to be honest, the plot is a bit all over the place; there are just far too many plot holes. Nevertheless it all led to a rather interesting twist, and it's the twist that gives this movie the 5 points I've awarded. And what a waste of talent by some pretty decent actors.

Fantasy Island is a fun & twisty thriller.,8,16 April 2020,"Blumhouse's Fantasy Island (or simply Fantasy Island) is a 2020 American supernatural horror film directed and co-written by Jeff Wadlow. A horror re-imagination and prequel to ABC's 1977 television series of the same name, it stars Michael Peña, Maggie Q, Lucy Hale, Austin Stowell, Portia Doubleday, Jimmy O. Yang, Ryan Hansen, and Michael Rooker. Produced by Wadlow and Marc Toberoff, as well as Jason Blum through his Blumhouse Productions banner, the plot follows five people who visit the eponymous island, discovering that their dream fantasies brought to life begin to turn into horrific living nightmares they must try to survive.It really bugs me that nobody is giving this movie credit where credit is due, this is an inventive and fun horror thriller which is refreshing in comparison to the likes of most other horror movies out there. The movie even has some pretty emotional moments and makes you think about how you would feel in the same position of the characters. Give the movie a chance if you like horror movies and ignore the critics.",Fantasy Island
119,thenolanfan,Review - Fantasy Island,2,22 November 2020,"Thanks but no thanks, I prefer Westworld (the series and the film) in every way. Fantasy Island doesn't have the merit to exploit its stupid concept, and I have not begin to talk about the plot twist.
To put it simply, that plot twist is by far the worst plot twist in the history of cinema, there is not even a close contender.
Worst absurd horror film since Nothing But Trouble.",Fantasy Island
120,rish2006,This was fun,10,15 February 2020,"First, this wasn't actually a horror film but it was so fun to watch like a ride on the seat. This film was a jumanji kind of film with a sprinkle of inception. Full score coz it was worth it.",Fantasy Island
121,chubarova,Good film.,7,23 April 2020,"I don't know why the rate of this film is so low. Firstly, the story is quite interesting, it has some moral, but I think it's more comedy and thriller than horror. Also film has detective aspect, and you solve the secret of island. Secondly, the cast is good, Michael Pena looks great as island's boss.
So, it's good comedy thriller.",Fantasy Island
122,rehmankhilji,Poorly described,4,16 April 2020,"The movie only lacked was poor script, the reason for everything was not properly described in the movie, which makes it super boring in the end.
Michael Peña, good actor, half hearted performance. Maggie Q, well she seem helpless with the baseless script. Lucy Hale, not at all good.
There are many flaws in the movie, bad script, poor storyline and some confused and not in line direction.
The start is good but afterwards without proper explanation the movie seems totally incomplete.
Could have been way better.",Fantasy Island

Having a fantasy come true is often like the old tale of the ""Monkey's Paw""; there is a dark side no one never considers.I missed the down on their luck or on their way out show biz celebrities that were continually guest stars on the old TV series. Casting Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Bynes, Paris Hilton, Mike Myers, Dana Carvey, any sports figure past their prime and or a classic old time actor or two would have been a nice addition - even if just in supporting\cameo roles.Good fun... just forget the old show while watching!",Fantasy Island

126,danybur,"Silly, but intriguing and fun",6,24 April 2021,"Summary:This sort of prequel to the homonymous series has a curious effect: on the one hand it is undoubtedly silly, but with its twists, its charismatic and diverse characters, its mix of genres and the variety of situations it poses, it is also a fun film, which achieves generate intrigue and thereby keep the viewer hooked.An ideal movie for a Saturday night.Review:Fantasy Island could be taken as a long pilot chapter and in a current key of the famous television series starring Ricardo Montalbán that aired between 1978 and 1984.A group of tourists arrives on an island where their main unfulfilled wish materializes. In almost all cases, a past event that projects loss, frustration, or guilt and must be repaired in some way.The film bets on the mix of genres: science fiction, comedy, thriller, action, drama, horror and survival reality and seems a combination of Lost, Westworld, Dark and some other series and films that should not be revealed.Although it is somewhat silly, it raises a great variety of situations, climates, turns and changes of points of view that manage to keep the viewer hooked and the convergence of the characters and their narrative lines is more or less achieved, resulting in a fun film , ideal for a Saturday night.",Fantasy Island

129,tfminfl,Goofy fun action horror,7,2 March 2020,"399. Fantasy Island. It's pretty amazing, no not the movie. It's pretty amazing when you go into something with low expectations they are usually met. And this was no different. With that mindset, I enjoyed it. I remember watching the show as a kid, but it somehow gets meshed with The Love Boat, so I remember Tattoo saying 'de plane, de plane' and Mr Roarke saying 'Welcome to Fantasy Island' that's about it. Minus Tattoo, Mr Roarke welcomes this group of 5 people to the island and explains the rules. Live out your fantasy until it's natural conclusion. Natural conclusion heh? We get two brothers on the Island simply wanting to have it all. Another guy's big dream is to enlist in the military like his daddy. Another guest's fantasy is to get revenge on her high school bully, and the final guest wants to say yes, instead of no at her wedding proposal. And everything is pretty freakin sweet for awhile until they realize that the fantasies are a little too real. Whats wrong with that? Small example: The guys that simply wanted it all. When you have it all, other people usually want to take it from you, including armed masked men! Fantasies with consequences, whats up with that??? I'd want a refund! A movie so bad, it's good.

Wow was a badly badly wrong..........I am actually embarrassed, at the start of every year I make a top 10 list of the top films I want to see that year..............THIS was at number 8. I think I need to reevaluate my taste in film trailers......hahaha...........don't trust them !!!!To be perfectly honest with you walking out of this film I never would have thought it was a horror film because the majority of it , I was laughing my head off.........not with the film but at it obviously.The directing and especially the writing is just terrible...........I hate trashing on a film but this is just so lazy , cliche , boring , uninteresting and stereotyped garbage that does not belong in theatres in 2020..............come on we can all do better than this..................Sadly this film is not even fun to watch , its laughably bad.The people I most feel sorry for is not the audience but the actors. Bless them you can all see that they are trying their best...........I commend every single one of them for not breaking down and laughing themselves. You cant blame them at all that is what they were told to do. So I give all of them a pass !!Although it is always nice to see Michael Rooker play a really creepy guy........I really like Michael Rooker I think he is great in everything he does !!Overall there is nothing positive about this film.........well apart form it being under 2 hours.......can you imagine if it was more !!!! 20% out 100 its just a terrible film and concept to being with.........how did this get through the script development stage ???

132,kenzibit,Bad reviews for a good movie.,5,2 May 2020,"Ignored the bad reviews and watched this and I must say I really did enjoy it. It seemed different from other movies and that needs to be experienced by everyone, don't let the reviews spoil it.",Fantasy Island
133,Jared_Andrews,Nightmare Island,1,22 February 2020,"My search to find even a single redeeming quality of the movie came up empty.It's beyond comprehension why a Blumhouse, a studio that has produced ""Get Out"" and the ""Happy Death Day"" films, continues to also lend its hand to atrocities like this predictably loathsome horror reimagining of the popular ""Fantasy Island"" TV series. Attaching the Blumhouse name to the project proved to a be a fatal mistake, which no one could have seen coming except everyone. I'm not sure there was really much juice to squeeze from this rotten fruit, but whatever there was, the filmmakers certainly made the least of it.The lack of star power in the cast provides the first hint of the movie's pitiful quality. A startlingly overqualified Michael Pena stands out as the only exception. He plays the mysterious Mr. Roarke, the man running the island's resort. He's meant to be mysterious, at least. The big mystery to me is why Michael Pena agreed to be in the movie.The guests on the Fantasy Island arrive as winners of contest, gifted a chance to live out their single most desired fantasy. Among the collection of annoying and moronic characters are two unfunny brothers whose veins run rich with alcohol and dimwittedness. They fantasize of having it all. Other guests include a late-blooming former social outcast who fantasizes about getting revenge on a junior high school bully, a career woman who regrets declining a past marriage proposal, and a cop who dreams of being in the army.The story carries out much as expected, with Mr. Roarke giving warnings about their fantasies not panning out as they might expect, warnings the guests promptly ignore. The scenes in which the guests finally live their fantasies are not scary nor funny nor interesting in any way. Each story attempts to strike a jarringly different tone, which makes the movie feel a handful of separate stories that are haphazardly slapped together.None of the story seems fully realized or even partially realized. Saying this script feels like a first draft would be generous - it's more like a few scribbled notes that were never once proofread.After each fantasy takes a dark turn, there isn't much more that happens. The story doesn't advance in any meaningful way, never gaining momentum. Every few minutes a new scene will come to a grinding halt as a different character pukes exposition to let viewers know why things are happening. It's an offensive violation of the ""show don't tell"" rule of writing.Of course, the writers save the worst for last. A third act plot twist comes out of left field and makes absolutely no sense when held to the slightest bit of scrutiny. The rest of the plot, which was already dangling by a single thread of coherence, is completely invalidated by the big reveal. Don't waste your time trying to figure out this movie if you've already seen it. Just cut your losses and move on. If you haven't seen it, don't. I urge you, don't.",Fantasy Island
134,jp281995,Ridiculous,3,16 February 2020,"I actually like the premise. A magical island where you can live with your heart's desires, but with horrific consequences.The plot is just a mess, especially on the climax parts. Dialogues and acting are so-so, but you can't really expect much with these types of movies. That twist is actually quite shocking at first, but then it later confused me because there are scenes where she acted all shocked and scared too and now she's suddenly the killer? It was a mess.",Fantasy Island

The plot was a little convoluted for an hour and 40 minute movie. And, the special effects were very cheesy. Like something out of a 1970's movie. And, Mr. Rourke was a short dark haired guy. Mr. Rourke was a taller grey/white haired man in the original series and reboot series. This guy was just the wrong choice for Mr. Rourke. All that being said, I enjoyed it for what it was.

Either way you look at it, it's the story of what if some ones fantasey involves revenge and murder? Enough said, if it doesn't interest yet, look the other way, as its not something fans of the light-hearted TV series will get a kick out of... unless of coarse you enjoyed such films like House In Haunted Hill (1999), The Final Destination movies (without the cool kill scenes) or maybe House of Wax (2005)The film is sure no masterpiece of cinematography, nor will it win any awards, but then again, why do those who only want to watch those award winners want to watch a modern day horror flick? Just to complain? LolIf you liked those type of movies I mentioned, you know, the typical plot of a bunch of people being trapped somewhere and have to fight to survive unless they wanna be killed... then this movie is ok for one nights viewing. Its certainly not boring, the acting is fine, the plots decent, the behind the scenes crew all did their parts well.... there's no flaws in how the movie is... you'd just have to be a real film snob to say it's a waste of time.
The real waste of time comes from time wasters who watch films they're not interested in, especially the horror genre, then write reviews about how much they hated it, or just want to hate on remakes of anything. Well, you won't find a Tom Tanks performance here, but do you really expect to?I give it a 5.5. It doesn't tarnish the reputation of the original show, it's not really tied to it, it's a horror version of it, it has a few nods to the series here and there, but in the end, only watch it if it interestes you.",Fantasy Island

155,steeleronaldr,Not bad,5,4 April 2021,"This movie had something of a 50/50 going on. Two of the fantasies didn't really make sense while the other two was ok.Two guys wanting to be popular at a party, one with the girls and the other (gay) wanted hot guys and drugs. That one really made no sense. The other a woman wants to make a girl pay for having a affair with her boyfriend/husband but back's out.A woman who lost her husband and daughter in a fire wants to rescue them, I can see that. Only problem there is it was a fantasy and in reality she'd still not have her husband and daughter. Finally a guy wants to meet his father he never knew. He's sent to the warzone which isn't how he wanted to meet him.Now I say that it was a good promise for a good movie but why Hollywood changed the whole concept to a thriller is puzzling. We get something like zombies that can't die and the guest has to learn who's in control of them or die trying. Michael Pena is a good actor but here he's a bit miscast as Roarke and where is Tattoo. They should have just made the movie on the same concept as the TV show but with more adult themes.I agree with a few that the movie starts to get hard to follow. The characters on the other hand I thought were boring as all heck. With two wanting to meet/rescue there spouse/father was a bit overwhelmed. The father one however could have been a great storyline. The rescue one as well. The other two were a bit of a reach. One wanting gay sex and drug's, I'm sure he could have saved all the money spent with just meeting the right people. The other mainly wanted sex with a gorgeous woman again I'm sure he could have done so without help. The other two were in tune with the show. Why they turned it into a thriller the way they do to me destroyed the whole concept.Even arriving on the island each guest was welcomed and explained to Tattoo why they were there. The show was a huge success so why change it. This could have been a stand alone movie the way it was made. Even calling it a disappointment last year can't be held against it.Was it good, on a certain level yes it was good but on another no. Was it interesting, no, none of the characters were interesting to begin with. Fans of the show were most likely let down because that's not how the show was. I give it 5 out of 10 because the movie doesn't really try to hold your attention. All they do is cry and whine throughout the movie and who the hell was Michael Rooker supposed to be. Another fantasy turned dark I guess. Nothing was really explained and why everything turned to a survive or die trying to leaves a few questions. I see a sequel coming just don't know why. Guess this one is a hate or like depending on the viewer.",Fantasy Island

This movie is more horror than not, but not by much, and surprisingly true to the original show while still doing something new.This movie cost $7M to make, and if not profitable already should be by the end of next weekend. So there's a decent chance they make a $10M sequel. And as every review is people pissed this wasn't more extreme, I will have to check spoiler reviews before watching Fantasy Island 2-7.The post credits moment actually happens at the end of the movie before the credits so there's no post credits scene.",Fantasy Island
174,MagicMurderFan,It wasn't awful...,5,13 May 2020,"That being said, there was just too much going on. Too many side issues that tied in together but wasn't surprising, I blame that on the script.I love it when a remake, casts new types of actors opposite from the original and it works. This however was not the case, I love Michael Pena, but his accent was butchered. Like we're you Venezuelan, German, Mexican, or just trying to sound mystic? It was bad and much like another reviewer said, he should have been Tattoo. But the premise was good, just not a great execution. Austin Stowel looked like a complete tool the entire time. A dumbfounded look on his face the entire time, I was waiting for him to say ""duhhhh."" And maybe drool a little. The cheese-o-meter alarm went off with the ""you're a hero"" scene. Meh. It was entertaining, but I would have been pissed if I went to a theater to see it.",Fantasy Island

182,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Fantasy Island More Like Convoluted Island,6,25 February 2020,"DE PLANE, DE PLANE! I mean Stream to Big Screen strikes again. This weekend we were able to view Fantasy Island, as well. Fantasy Island is a horror adaptation/perversion of the old TV show from the 70's. The movie stars a cast of characters headlined by Lucy Hale, Michael Pena and Maggie Q. But should people go to the theater to view this movie?Let's start with the easiest way to describe this movie, which is if Shutter Island had a baby with Inception and one of the grandparents was Fantasy Island the TV show. If you've seen those two movies before, WHICH I STRONGLY RECOMMEND DOING IF YOU HAVEN'T, then you know just how deceptive, convoluted, and involved this movie is trying to be. Now, that description could be a compliment but in this situation, it is not. Fantasy Island does not measure up to either movie yet it essentially steals elements of both. Even though it is billed as a horror film, the viewer is deceived because Fantasy Island falls more into the Shutter Island psychological thriller realm than pure horror. The other elements of the movie fall more into the Inception Sci-Fi/Thriller realm. Either way, Fantasy Island fails to have a distinct intent and it's supposed genre was never fully embraced.Furthermore, the movie is so twisted that it straightens itself out before the two final twist reveals. Just listen to how confusing that statement was. Fantasy Island tried so hard to keep viewers on their toes that they ruin their own anti-climatic twists. I will give credit to the producers that the twists were still executed well but they lacked umph. The viewer is left unafraid due to the overly complicated storytelling and plot developments. It would have served the movie well to just be classified more like the previous movies mentioned, rather than not delivering on the horror genre.Even with those issues, the cast was sub-par. Individually, the actors were average, but collectively, the actors were still just average. Lucy Hale was by far the best performance at times but still was annoying. I feel Michael Pena was underutilized and or the writing and directing just squandered the possibility of the character. In fact, all of the ensemble cast had issues of being extremely annoying. Now, that I think about it, the writing in this movie was just poor overall. AH HA, found the issue.With that said, de plane de plane... *clears throat* excuse me. Fantasy Island is a letdown for a horror movie but in a way could have succeeded as a Sci-Fi, psychological thriller. The storyline is not original, which is why they tried to make it so confusing. Or should I say a fantasy within a fantasy within a fantasy. Did they just successfully create an inception?! Either way, you can see this at a matinee time but you're best served waiting for this to come on HBO Go or a streaming service.",Fantasy Island
183,gregoryroman-88635,Sort of Strange but Entertaining,6,24 May 2020,"This film has its moments, enough to keep you interested and guessing. Not the best multi-genre (suspense-thriller-SyFy-drama-action) movie I've ever seen, but it's worth the $5.99 streaming rental. Loosely based on the old TV show only because of ""Mr. Rourke""...everything else is completely different so whatever you thought you knew about Fantasy Island...throw it all out. You may also have a hard time following along, especially at the end, because there are lots of challenging character jumps which makes for a mushy plot. Other than that, not too bad.

185,fairlesssam,So disappointing :0(,2,5 September 2020,"I was so very disappointed after all the hype for this movie. When watching it I was absolutely gutted to be honest. It was quite laughable. Talked up as a Blumhouse spectacular tale of horror when in fact it felt like a vintage James Bond spin off.Guests are invited to Fantasy Island to live out their ultimate fantasy but when they begin to do so the fantasy does not go how they imagined it would and some take a very sinister turn.I found that the characters lacked any kind of depth or development, they weren't likeable at all. The whole concept of the island just seemed messy and didn't work for me at all. It just bordered on ridiculous.",Fantasy Island

Granted it starts like Ricardo Montalban's 'rich Corinthian leather' a throw back to the 1977 tv show.But then the magic starts, and there are more plot twists than a corkscrew. Before you know it we're somewhere between the Twilight Zone, and American Horror Stories. Just when you think, 'Aha I see where this is going', BAM, the story shifts again.I watch a lot of movies. Many are beneath contempt. Lacking in one or more of the key ingredients. This movie has a good cast, great writing, incredibly imaginative. Limited but effective use of CGI.This movie deserves a watch. If you do, please give it time to get beyond the slow beginning. If you do, I think you might just enjoy it.",Fantasy Island

190,zadeereviews,Interesting premise/ execution is so so,5,30 October 2020,I love these types of thriller mystery movies. Specially Blumhouse movies Are now known for mystery horror thriller movies. I so wanted to like this movie. It's not a bad movie I mean I was able to watch it through till the end but it wasn't much of satisfactory at the end. It's was just okay. If you have nothing else to watch and just want to have something on so u can just watch while u on ur phone or doing something else this wouldn't be a bad movie.,Fantasy Island

What it actually does manages to do is to mimic one of those parties that is showcased in 3 minutes scenes on TV's CSI or the first season of Ballers.If this was packaged as one of those movies playing on HBO, then you can just play it in the background while you fiddle with other things.",Fantasy Island

193,daryopeek,Few funs but mostly confusing,5,9 October 2020,"Fantasy Island has intrigued me from its trailer when it was screened few months ago in the cinemas. I never know that the film was based on a popular TV series. Being that as my initial thought, it gave me confusing vibe to be fully connected with the plot. The movie starts like we already used to the TV series' premise, so an outsider like me need longer time to understand.What probably makes the movie fun is the whole you can live your own fantasy idea which pretty much interesting, but get stale after the horror starts. Probably due to the acting being not very smooth, I couldn't really comfortable watching the movie. And the last thing, many final scenes involving fake caves and it's so B-movie down to the core.So if you have known the series or watch some episodes, it is quite fun to watch this movie, but not recommended for those who never, or don't like B movie elements in your watchlist very much.",Fantasy Island

Every time this movie tried to reference the TV show, it felt more cheesy than nostalgic.The premise for this movie was good. The execution was horrible.I like Michael Pena....but not as Mr. Roarke. He was miscast in this role. He does not have the presence of Ricardo Montalban.I hated most of the other characters.The two ""high five brothers"" were hard to watch. They looked like a bad version of an SNL skit.The story/fantasy of the ""army guy"" was OK, but it didn't pan out well.I hated Lucy Hale's character when I first watched the trailers. I hated her role in the movie even more. Her story/fantasy started out interesting, but then it quickly fell apart.Maggie Q wasn't too bad, but I didn't like her story/fantasy.The script must have been one page: Let stupid things happen to stupid people who do stupid stuff.

195,Diablo1616,This is Not Even A Movie,3,15 April 2020,"This movie had way too much going on. It was hard to follow the main plot because there was no main plot. Going off the title and the trailer, I thought that the move was going to be a scene where people were led to believe that they'd get their deepest wishes fulfilled and then things take a twisted turn causing them to fight for their lives...ONLY. I didn't think it would be that, but then a little of this, and that, and a twist into something totally different. It was confusing, and I have so many questions as to how everything that was a twist and turn came out to be. For instance, what was the deal with the ""black zombies""? What really happened the day of the fire that killed the one guy? How did the one chick who was supposed to go on a date with him that day even know the others played a role in his death somehow? Why did the little girl kill her dad? So much going on, and it was totally unorganized.",Fantasy Island

The twist at the end is not something you see ahead until a few moments before it happens.I have never watched the old Fantasy Island so I cannot tell if it has any similarities.This is a movie for people that loved the old Scream, Know What You Did Last Summer and especially The Cabin in the Woods.

The rest of the cast was miscast. The writing was poor and the director couldn't decide the genre.",Fantasy Island

I like this combination and Fantasy Island delivered in its setting. The story is crazy at times and unexpected things happened. 1/2 on premise and 1/1 on the plot setting.The cast did not pull off a masterpiece while performing but I would say they did not disappoint at the same time. 1/2 on the cast. The directing and cinematography could have been better considering the plot of the movie. 1/2 is decent enough. I would personally give the movie 1/2 as I enjoyed watching this but it is not something I would prefer to watch multiple times or loved.",Fantasy Island

The story is interesting and makes us think about what we would wish if were in that island, but unfortunately turns to be a little annoying in due of the lack of tension and violence. I just can say this film is more a drama with comedy and fantasy elements than a horror movie.The other problems are the acting of some characters (I don't think Lucy Hale is a bad actress, she's just unlucky about the roles that she accepts) and the main plot twist that doesn't make ANY SENSE.SPOILERS:
During the final act, everything reveals to be a revenge plan made by Lucy Hale's character. She tried to bring all the people involved in the accident of the man who she loved. That doesn't make sense because during the movie she helps some people and is surprised about everything that happens in the island. During the first act she goes to that torture room alone and she's in shock when finds everything is real and the kidnapped woman in front of her is also real, but in the ending she says that knew everything about the powers of the island.ENDING OF THE SPOILERS!For me, Fantasy Island is a campy film, it's really weak however can be so funny and entertaining to watch with a nice group of friends.",Fantasy Island

Why have Hollywood people all lost their imaginations?,4,15 September 2020,"Perhaps this could have been made into a good movie if Hollywood and all their minions from Key Grip to Big Time Stars stopped thinking about politics and focused on being creative, or at the very least...finding some creative people who seem to still be writing graphic novels, comic books, and other fantasy works of fiction? The actors have done good work previously. I'm not going to blame them for wanting a paycheck for actually working. I'm not a writer, but I definitely can come up with ideas, outlines for a movie plot because I've not lost my imagination or how to dip into different topics and give ideas on character motivations and plot lines.

205,FilmChamp20,Terrible waste of a movie idea,3,15 April 2020,"I honestly don't know how to describe this mess of a movie. It felt so rushed and poorly put together. I'm sorry, but this movie is awful.The acting, my god, it was either atrocious or it had no heart to it. Some of the actors there were so off their game. Like they were held at gun point to play a role in it. Others, well, they just are bad actors or this was a film made purely for the sake of bringing in income for a quick buck.It felt like a movie made to make fun of horror. Nothing, I mean absolutely nothing, was scary or believable. Nothing was interesting and nothing felt genuine. I honestly felt embarrassed for the cast the whole time. This felt like a film made for TV on Adult Swim or something. I swear the actors were blackmailed into this movie. You could just feel the lack of interest or passion in them.I've heard nothing but bad things about this movie. Reviews from websites to YouTube. I just wanted to try it for myself because maybe I could squeeze some enjoyment out of it. No. I was so wrong. You can get the same feeling out of this film if you go watch a cringe compilation on YouTube.All in all, I feel most of the cast want to brush this under the rug like it never happened. The story, the acting, the writing, and the directing were all just so embarrassingly bad or stale. They must have thought the audience would be slow because most of the movie is characters explaining everything to make sure you, as the audience, understands. No confidence in believing we can figure it out or understand it ourselves.Just avoid this movie. You'll feel so unsatisfied for it. It ends cheesy and cliche. Almost laughable.

207,lusciousmuffins,It's far better than its rating would lead you to believe,10,2 May 2021,"I'm not sure why this movies does not have a higher score, so I'm giving it a 10.To be clear, this film is not the next Citizen Kane, but for what it is, Fantasy Island is actually quite impressive.Perhaps people who were fans of the original show were disappointed that this movie went in a very different direction than its predecessor; however, I consider that to be a big part of what made it so successful.Instead of another cheesy reboot that simply stretches out a TV show with a run time of 45 minutes by padding it with over the top nostalgia, the makers of Fantasy Island the movie created something that can stand on its own.Consequently, what you get is a very intricately constructed script that weaves together multiple storylines, using the premise of the original 1970/80s series to tie them all together.By subverting expectations both in terms of the audience's existing vision of Fantasy Island and the story of each of the main characters, this movie unfolds into something quite impressive.I also have to give the film's makers a lot of credit for what they managed to pull off in terms of character development and multiple plotlines; they packed a whole lot into the runtime.Do yourself a favor if you have not already seen Fantasy Island; approach it with an open mind.Viewing this film without preconceived notions is a good way to ensure you get the most out of it and, contrary to what many of the reviews would have you believe, it has a lot to offer.",Fantasy Island
208,keyope,Not bad but a bit messy,6,11 May 2021,"Watching this film was an odd experience. On several occasions I felt bored and started to fast forward a bit. But each time I did I found myself engaged in it again. The problem is there is a lot going on in this film, and while it's not particularly confusing it is overly complicated for a film that should be good fun. It's a mix of horror, comedy, drama and fantasy. There are a number of storylines running concurrently and while none of them are bad, they all have moments where they get a bit dull. So you switch from a really exciting scene in one story to a slow plodding scene in another, and it gets a bit irritating. The acting is all decent. This is the second Maggie Q film I've seen in recent weeks and both were mystery / horror affairs set in exotic locations. And while neither film is great, I've found her very watchable.At times this film has some good twists, turns and surprises but it's one of those films that, as it gets closer to the end, its twists come in thick and fast. Every five minutes the story seems to get turned on its head. Some twists are good, others just feel forced.The film does tie every storyline up in a reasonably satisfying way, but overall this feels like a missed opportunity. It's a good idea, it's well made, but it's just a bit too messy and complicated when it could have been a little simpler and therefore a bit more fun. It's worth a look, and the 4.9 rating on imdb seems harsh, but only a little. With perhaps one less story thread this could have been a 7/10.",Fantasy Island
209,Skippy489,Fair Adaptation,6,9 October 2020,"What is it with 2020 films and changing their title periodically? When I fist watched Fantasy Island, they called Blumhouse's Fantasy Island, now its just Fantasy Island. Anybody know if Birds of Prey decided on an official title yet? Any way, lets take a trip back to Fantasy Island.This film is a horror thriller. Like the television show there are multiple plots occurring at the same time. The primary one, the thriller one, and the comic relief one. With this adaptation, each of these storylines- sadly- cannot pick a theme and follow through with it. They are always changing. The overall tone of the film is dark and uncomfortable, and mysterious, everybody has secrets, maybe that is the theme. Oh well, that is too much information, lets get back to the critiquing of the film. The film was first announced as a dark and gritty reboot of the classic Saturday night show, it lacks the grittiness for most of the film- but it is dark. It is more of a modern adaptation of the show that also serves as a prequel, as spoiler, how can you remake Fantasy Island without Tattoo, or another assistant to Mr. Roarke from the start of the film? My other complaint is there were no cameos of the original actors, but that is mainly because they were deceased before filming began, though more evident nods to the original series would be appreciated- saying that some of the co-hosts that filled in for Tattoo are still around.
This cinematic adaptation of Fantasy Island is closer to the television show than a horror film, although the horror elements are present and the film has some great ideas to make it ""their own"", the film lacks quality in the end.This is a fun film, even though the political correctness involving the clichés stereotypes that seem to make it into everything in the entertainment world these days. Lucy Hale gives one of her best performances to date and Michael Pena did a good job with the role of Mr. Roarke. There is great chemistry between the actors who are the guests on the island as well, but this film serves more of an origin story for the Island Resort while still keeping the concepts of the television show alive. While this film is a hot mess, it is still enjoyable for fans of the original show as well as people who want a thriller based action film.",Fantasy Island
210,banzanbon,Dumb!,2,14 February 2020,"The TV show was silly and light as possible but his movie beats the tv series in it's ridiculousness.Very decent casting is sacrificed to a two bit script that goes nowhere. The premise of the tv show, about the people who descended on the island to have their wishes granted remains the same but the forced nature of the so-called horror is so throwaway and pseudo sensational that it quickly becomes more of a yawner than anything else. They try to throw in some funny bits but that just seems like an attempt at seeing what they can make stick.All in all, this movie should have been a tragedy, because it's a lost cause all around.

Sea snakes, mystery stone, the black water that's dripping everywhere, what's real and what's not real.Melanie Cole is a failure, creating a twist at the end about how all of this is just parts of her fantasy combined.

217,thomasmitilis1995,Fantasies Rarely Play out As You or I Might Expect. but They Always Play out Exactly as They Should...,2,31 May 2020,"PROS:
~Maggie Q. makes a respectable effort as a desperate woman who desires the life she never had. Sure, her storyline is kind of cliche but you feel for her through the film. Besides this, the interaction between Lucy Hale and Portia Doubleday is an interesting aspect of the movie to a certain extent.CONS:
~The mystery element of the island isn't properly explained. Only one fantasy is supposed to be satisfied but some characters conveniently break the rules. Furthermore, why do the different fantasies intersect each other and what are the overall qualities of the island?
~The ending twist makes no sense and you question everything you have watched. It's proven that Lucy Hale's character is the actual villain but she looks surprised when she arrives on the island. There is one torture scene specifically where at first she thinks that the kidnapped woman (Portia Doubleday) in front of her is fake but then shockingly realizes that everything is real. The revelation that all the other guests are responsible for the death of her tinder boyfriend is weird, not to mention that it is impossible to find that all these people were present the night of the tragic event.
~The subplot of Austin Stowell's character is laughable. At some point he has the opportunity to be together with his dead father (Mike Vogel) but for some reason when the latter takes a different path -to be with his son- he is criticized by his son for not being a hero.
~The jokes don't land for the most part. Jimmy O. Yang and Ryan Hansen play two brothers who are very stereotypical and deliver some cringeworthy lines. In other words, they are a strong example of the overall dialogue of the movie which is terrible (why do they keep repeating that they are beloved brothers?). Moreover, the decision of the first one to stay on the island instead of his brother (who has died during the movie) is nonsensical and the fun service that is given to the viewers of the old Tv series related with him is forced.
~Michael Pena is totally miscast here. He is more softer than he's supposed to be and the behavior of the others towards him in the end is laughable after all those things he has done to them. Michael Rooker's presence is almost nonexistent and it's a pity that the film doesn't use him more.
~The film lacks the horror element. There are a few jump scares that aren't effective and the zombie-like creatures are uninteresting. In addition, random sea snakes are thrown into the mix in order to possibly forget the expository writing.",Fantasy Island

Yes there is some fun to be had in this movie because of how bad it is there is many scenes in this movie that had me bursting into laughter because of how bad and ridiculous it is. The only good thing in this movie easily has to be the concept of this movie because it's a really intreasting concept, but the execution of the concept was just so bad. The characters in this movie are not likable at all they are all jerks and I didn't care about any of them at all. The movie is also extremely boring and it had me looking at my phones clock just counting down the minutes till the movie was over. The pacing in this movie is so slow and the runtime of 1 hour and 49 minutes felt like 2 hours and 30 minutes. There is so much scenes in this movie that could of been cut out to make the movie shorter but no. The dialog in this movie is awful and had me laughing out loud many times. This movie is not scary at all and a lot of the ""scares"" had me either laughing out loud or just rolling my eyes. Overall I really wish I could of gave fantasy island a more positive review but I really didn't like this movie, and that is really disappointing because this movie had a lot potential to be good.",Fantasy Island

A good blend of suspense, fantasy, horror and drama all blended into an interesting yet curious storyline which goes a bit beyond believability, but still draws you in.Regardless enjoy it for what it is, adventure action aplenty with a dose of fantasy thrown in for good measure. Some fine moments as well as some cheesy ones balance out and all in all a movie worthwhile watching. Definitely a strong 7/10.

I was bored from the beginning waiting for something breath taking to happen, needless to say, it did not happen. A horror movie without suspense is just a bad soap opera.

No, I'm not talking about the fantasies turned nightmares at the centre of the film, but rather the need for films like Fantasy Island to remind audiences what constitutes a good film to begin with.At the top of that list should be a coherent storyline, something which Fantasy Island didn't seem able to budget into its meagre $7 million price-tag. What begins as a fun B-grade horror/thriller quickly descends into abject nonsense, with a last act that will either have you howling in laughter or utter disbelief... or both. It's like the studio decided to take the supernatural elements from Lost, but forgot to bring the nuance, depth or philosophical pretence that made that show (mostly) work. Or they just hired the guys who wrote Truth or Dare.Full disclosure, I have never seen an episode of the same-titled 70's show upon which the film is based on. Maybe those who find the show a guilty pleasure will be more forgiving of the film's utter nonsense. But, if there's one thing they are less likely to forgive is the film's treatment of an iconic character.

I liked the intertwining that they did, thought it added a lot.It's Blumhouse for gods sake, what did people expect? Blumhouse isn't going for oscars, they're just here to entertain us, and I was entertained.All in all it was a fun way to spend a couple hours on a day off from work.

Maybe a ""be careful what you wish for"", but I really hoped for a movie with a critique. To me, the best horror monsters represent something. It's not just a monster, it's the AIDS epidemic in a hockey mask. It's not just an alien, but the threat of what we might discover if we push science too far.This was not that movie. In point of fact, it wasn't even a cautionary tale. It was a painfully generic horror movie. There's nothing I could say that would enlighten this film. The characters were bland and uninteresting; the setting was well rendered, but poorly executed; the twist actively UNDERMINED the tension of the film, and the last minute reveal that the movie is a prequel to the show is just... head shaking.It isn't worth your time.",Fantasy Island

We have Fantasy Island, and holy crap, I loved the movie. It was so amazing to experience everybody's fantasies. One was Revenge, One was Seeing dead ones, One was life of party, and One was do-over. I found it unique to experience the fantasies each Visitor had. And it was even more interesting when the twists happen.1. Melanie: Revenge - Wanted a kid friendly revenge such as embarrassment on a bully that traumatized her. She then realized that the revenge was going too far when a guy came in and cut her bully's wrist2. Peter - Seeing his Father - Peter wanted to see his Father who died a hero. He gotten the chance to see him, but ended up changing what would happen. His father still died a hero but instead of saving his team, he saved his son3. JD and Brax- Party life - They gotten a great party with males (Brax is Gay) and Females. But the house they party in...I think it belonged to the Mafia so they were involved with the mafia
4. Gwen - Do Over - She wanted to change things in her life which was say Yes to getting Married and Save her neighbor (Nick) from the fire. The second was the twist.Now there were some questions I was having about the movie. For starters, the twist where the twists to each Fantasy was Melanie's doing as revenge for losing her love Nick. What was more confusing was how did she know the visitors she was with was part of it. Her Lover Nick died in the fire. The visitors of Fantasy Island was there around the fire, but Melanie wasn't there when it happened. She said she read about it so how did she know who was there?

233,jan_kalina,"""Welcome to Fantasy Island.""",8,13 March 2020,"Somewhere at some isolate island is a hotel resort run by the mysteriosu Mr. Roarke (Michael Peña). Enter five guests as winners of some previously undisclosed competition (the audience doesn't need to know about such details, am I right?) And as the winners of this competition and based on some quick query, their fantasies will be fulfilled. No one is exactly sure what that entails. Only that all fantasies have to reach their natural conclusion, whatever that may mean.
Now important thing to those familiar with the original series from the 70s, this has nothing to do with that. At all. This is a thriller/horror.
Some of the fantasies differ from easy (to have it all - which is fulfilled as constant party time,) fixing a mistake in past, becoming a soldier to revenge on a high school bully.
The characters do not know how and in what way their fantasies will be fulfilled. It seems all fine and dandy at first, but then different fantasies start to overlap and then it all gets twisted up.
The whole cast gives great performances (Lucy Hale and Maggie Q being the stand out), and as the film progresses the film keeps on piling on twist upon a twist and it still makes sense but the main story may be a bit buried upon that heap of twists. It's just too twisty for its own sake. But it's a lot of fun.

So is it a cross between both genres or a hybrid? Well it did not feel like a big funny comedy nor did it feel like a full on horror, i guess mystery would be the best way to describe the genre. But thats just one point, i felt like that the film was trying to give us all the details in 1 film, so it felt rushed, i honestly think they could of made it over 2 / 3 films to explain things properly, all we get is each individual ""Fantasy"" followed by a really confusing plot twist that twists again to make things even more confusing that comes to a abrupt ending with little to no explanation on what actually is going on.But from what we get is that this island has some magical power to fulfil any fantasy, but Micheal Pena has to keep the guests fantasy alive to keep his fantasy alive which is his wife staying alive. Again it seems like a cool idea & i wish it had more films to explain it over.I think they've honestly missed a great opportunity here & because of that it has terrible reviews which means it will be forgotten about & never talked about in years to come.Also i was not aware that it was based on some TV show or a book from ages ago, after reading some other reviews, i will not be watching the TV series or the book if there is one.Age - 25Cinema: Cineworld Milton Keynes 2D (Unlimited Card)Watch, Avoid, Consider: Really Not Worth Watching, Even With Unlimited Card.",Fantasy Island

This flick is not just bad is terrible. Acting is horrendous, especially the one of Ryan Hansen. It was really obnoxious, same as the one of Jimmy Yang whose performance was plain ridiculous.The only two actors who did an acceptable job regardless of the poor script were Michael Peña and Maggie Q, whom i remember from Nikita.With some really great screen player, the movie could have been awesome.

If you see BLUMHOUSE PRODUCTIONS before your movies, RUN.Where to start with Fantasy Island? Remember Khan on the mysterious island with the little guy shouting ""Ze plane! Ze plane!""? Well, not here. You get Michael Peña, a great comedic actor, being all broody while five largely unlikable characters live out their fantasies on aforementioned mysterious island.I'm unsure how to review this movie without dropping spoilers so here we go. Our guests are Melanie (Lucy Hale), a young woman who fantasizes about evenge on her high school bully; Patrick (Austin Stowell), a cop who wanted to be in the military; Gwen (Maggie Q), who regrets rejecting her boyfriend's marriage proposal; and brothers J. D. (Ryan Hansen) and Brax (Jimmy O. Yang), who want it all.Once in their respective fantasies, the group find that all is not what they expected. Melanie realizes that her tormentor, Sloane (Portia Doubleday), is really there to be tortured. Patrick comes across his father (Gordon D. Kleut), who died in the war when he was young. Gwen accepts the proposal, and gets her happily ever after. J. D. and Brax indeed have it all: parties, girls and, in Brax's case, guys. And then there's Damon (Michael Rooker), a private investigator out to expose the island's secrets.What follows is a web of mystery and ideas that likely came up late in production, and the director, previously responsible for such misfires as Kick-Ass 2 and Truth or Dare, said ""throw it in!""

252,NarniaIsAwesome,Fantasy Island is... A Genius Concept That Just Barely Delivers.,6,18 February 2020,"The biggest selling point of this film, to me, was the idea of re-making a classic feel-good show into a horror movie. It truly is an imaginative approach, and certainly relevant given all the remakes/reboots of the movie's decade. That being said, it is not without flaws and oversights.The characters are fairly interesting, and the plot does exist. There is a mystery and everyone's situations payoff and come together in the end. So kudos for that. But there are traces of lazy writing and some annoying plot holes, if you think about it too much. The performances depend on the person. Michael Pena, who portrays Mr. Roarke, is excellent in his role, while Michael Rooker is quite hammy as a rogue jungle-detective.But one must give the filmmakers credit for refraining from an R-rating, especially given the previous success of titles like 'Joker' and 'Us.' The horror here is pretty creepy without being stomach turning.While it is not faultless, 'Fantasy Island' is a step in the right direction as far as creative re-makes, and horror that isn't just for gore fans.

To start things off with positives, the acting is pretty decent , the scenery is beautiful, the film sometimes can be interesting and this movie had potential because the premise sounds really fun and exciting. That's exactly what leads into my issues with the Fantasy Island because the excitement felt forced. I was actually enjoying the first 35 minutes but everything went downhill. My biggest issue with Fantasy Island is that it relies way too much on exposition as if I didn't know what was happening. Sometimes the dialogue makes me feel like I'm watching a teen show from ABC Family with cringeworthy pop culture references. The characters in this are stereotypical including with every horror movie trope that it tries to accomplish. Every character has a fantasy which in my opinion was messy and should have stuck with one that related to one of the plot twists. Thats another issue, there are plot twists that make the story aggravating and one that related to the whole characters fantasy that I found interesting and would have made the movie better if it only had that one plot twist.

Now I wonder why attempting to dig out such a franchise long buried ! Even if you try to find the show you'll realize its missing an entire season the owner company revealed it did physically lose its source along with few episodes from here and there from the other seasons . weather this could be an attempt to reboot the show , might well be , the sad part is the critics went really harsh on it deeming it never happening , so meh apparently what you end up with is a taste of a show that was once great in its own time about a mysterious island and its host that grants visitors their fantasies which might not turn out as they thought it to be .",Fantasy Island

1) Expecting a 70s TV show

A movie is about an island who fulfill your fantasy, any type ;) .Some guests came to this island, and their life turns ups n downs. The problem of this movie was the director, not been able to showcase it's message properly, twists n turns are understandable but creating a confusion n changing antagonist again n again is something else. Basic rule of movie direction is never confuse your audience. Might be if the direction and script writing should be done by a mature n experienced person the fate of the movie would be something else.

I didn't like the over the top diversity push, but in the end it worked its way though despite ticking every button over and over to fill the quota.
Loved seeing my birth place's beauty shine through with the scenery.

276,brent-27849,As bad as the ratings indicate,1,20 September 2021,"First problem is I didn't find any of the fantasies particularly interesting. The hot girl/guy fantasy is just stupid, and a couple of them, the lost love and the war game ended up being like really bad Twilight episodes.Second problem, the big trick ending that it's all the girl's fantasy doesn't make a lot of sense. For one thing, I thought they were all only allowed one fantasy, so how does it go from I want to beat up my childhood bully to yeah, I plan to kill all of you because none of you saved my date? Speaking of the bully fantasy, if the girl didn't think it was going to be real anyway, then why bother going to all the trouble to get all the others together, since how would she have the chance to go after any of them if they were all busy with their own fantasies? Might have made more sense to just hunt them down in the real world and kill them, I guess, if it was that important to her. Second, how did she know the lost love fantasy actually wouldn't have chosen, save the date fantasy in the first place, which would have made her look pretty foolish if she killed her before she had the chance to do it. Third, while maybe I can blame the cop for not acting, but the rest, really? Yes it was lost love's fault for starting the fire but it was an accident after all. And because one guy decides not to go out, that's supposed to count? Well why not just blame herself then for not calling two minutes after her date was late and telling him to drop dead, maybe that would have woken him up in time so he wouldn't have dropped dead. Or may as well blame the maker of the iron for not making a good iron, or maybe the guy who made her date's pillow since it was obviously so soft that he fell asleep too hard.Thirdly, if anyone wants to explain what's wrong with my argument in problem two, well here's problem three, I didn't care about some stupid surprise ending anyway. When a team of zombie/Terminators are chasing everyone, all armed with automatic weapons and explosives, on an island controlled by a magic crystal, I'm pretty sure I've stopped caring about whose dumbass fantasy it was anyway.

Now this movie will not win any Oscars, but neither will it be listed among the worst of all time either.

He really doesn't have the right presence or charisma. Nothing to do with Ricardo Montalban.This said, the fantasies are interesting, it's interesting how they turn grim and it's interesting how they eventually connect together.

You can't just show a character acting as if he or she is genuinely part of a plot with no hints showing otherwise, then change it. It's unconvincing and plain stupid.

I actually felt sorry for the actors having to recite such woeful lines.It honestly reminds me of those short stories we had to write in primary school where we try to fit in as many plot twists as possible to make it interesting. All that was missing was the classic, ""then, I woke up"" at the very end of the film.So why five stars then? Despite there being one cast member that I've actually seen before, the terrible script and the messy plot, it kept me interested even if my facial expressions said otherwise.

The end, it turns out an antagonist which is Melanie that her final fantasy is a revenge for Nick. The plot relies little on imagination or guesses from audiences to understand the coincidence of the invitation & Nick's deathThe black-eyes zombies seems familiar when I watched.

330,sammie_sambal,Started of promising but went for a convoluted plot half way through,4,15 November 2020,"Right from the start Blumhouse's Fantasy Island is a bit on the nose when it comes to it's source material so I knew that I was in for a campy ""horror"" movie. Actually, when I saw the movie poster/banner at first glance I thought it was family friendly adventure movie in same vain as the recent Jumanji and Journey to the Centre of the Earth movies, I would not have guessed horror or thriller. Anyhow, judging the movie by it's cover I already kinda knew what I was getting in to beforehand so the movie letting me know in a overly direct and unsubtle way that it is based on its title name sake didn't phase me all that much. My expectations were set to low and I did actually enjoy the movie and it's darker twist on the 'live your fantasy' premise. Unfortunately that premise never really gets fully explored because about half way through the movie the plot takes a sudden turn, followed by a twist, followed up by another twist and by the end you can only laugh at the ridiculous mess it has become. This movie is basically LOST in a nutshell if LOST was as good as is last few seasons overall.
I honestly think that if the plot would've kept on track with the whole 'you get what you wish for' Twilight Zone story and explored it further it could've turned out quite okay. It wouldn't have been nearly as good as a Cabin In The Woods but a least it would have tried to be as interesting. But no, instead we get a unpleasing mash-up of Fantasy Island with late 90's slasher films and a out of place Michael Pena played by Michael Pena. Don't get me wrong, I like Michael Pena, but he basically played the guy he always plays, and then a bored version of that guy.
That character needed more, he needed to be more mysterious and charming while being sinister and unpredictable at the same time. This mr. Roarke possesses none of those characteristics and frankly neither does the movie itself. For what this reincarnation sets out to do it fails. It starts of in the right direction but veers of course quickly never really living up to it's potential feeling very timid on the horror and scares along the way. Kind to think of it, I guess I wasn't all that far of with my family friendly adventure movies then.",Fantasy Island

In some way, the fantasy worked, in another way, things didn't, or, as happened in the movie, the fantasy ended.
I really didn't enjoy the tv show giving way to Love Boat on land as it did, with each person finding romance in the end as well.
I think only one time on the show did the fantasies crossover.
Granted, there seemed to be some bits that were a tad clunky, but in the end they all came together, . . . . somewhat connecting.
Hardly the worst movie, as all the other posts seem to think, and they did seem to be along the lines of what the people on the show always wanted.

2) Melanie: Wants to torment a high-school bully
3) Patrick: Wants to be in the military
4 & 5) Brax & JD: Siblings. Want ""it all""Needless to say, their fantasies don't play out the way they wanted it to. It is revealed towards the end that it is actually Melanie's ""fantasy"" that they all are a part of because she wants revenge on the other people because a guy named Nick accidentally died in a fire which was inadvertently started by Gwen. It is also revealed that everyone had a part in Nick's death.Here's where the problems begin.1) Right off the bat, I thought ""How does Melanie know who all had a part to play in Nick's accidental death?"" Brax was his roommate. Why would he be an active participant in Nick's killing? Patrick is shown to be a police officer at the scene of the fire. Again, from the very many police personnel, how would Melanie even know if Patrick was there at all?2) When the grenade is about to go off, wouldn't it be a wise decision to just escape with the others instead of bodyslamming onto it?3) If it was indeed Melanie's fantasy, why was Dr. Torture after her and attempted to injure/kill her?4) When the party scene is shown, who are all those people? Where did they come from? Are they some kind of ""projections"" (Inception reference) or are they actual people? If they're not actual people, Alessandro would simply respawn wouldn't he?5) How was Damon surviving and feeding himself?6) How did Sloane & Gwen magically figure out that whoever drinks the water gets their wish?7) Initially, when the panic room posse shuts the door, why did they not reopen it there and then? There were cameras inside so they could have easily seen that JD & Brax were alone. The room is later opened when the posse comes out of the panic room. What changed their mind then to open the door? Because presumably a panic room opens from the inside and not the outside.",Fantasy Island

343,westerfieldreviews,"""The Island of Trash""",2,4 March 2020,"""The Island of Trash""Jeff Wadlow works with Blumhouse Productions once more and takes the directorial lead to reboot the 1970's series of the same name not a single soul asked for. ""Fantasy Island"" is a film that acts as a perfect crash course on how not to construct an enticing narrative. Wadlow's work behind the camera is fine if not uninspired, but every aspect of ""Fantasy Island"" is uninspired and lazily done in a manner that would lead you to believe the entire cast and crew came up with several first ideas and ran with them without taking a second pass to flesh them out or make them intriguing. From terrible characters to an uninteresting plot that continues to stack insipid elements one on top of the other, ""Fantasy Island"" is a wreck of a film that above all else, will make you groan with every vapid moment that passes.
""Fantasy Island"" opens with our main cast of contest winners departing their plane and stepping foot onto the lush and beautiful local known as Fantasy Island. Our winners are Gwen Olsen (Maggie Q), Melanie Cole (Lucy Hale), Patrick Sullivan (Austin Stowell), Brax Weaver (Jimmy O. Yang), and J.D. Weaver (Ryan Hansen) who all have their own individual fantasies they wish to make a reality. While on the docks, they are all greeted by Julia (Parisa Fitz-Henley) a caretaker on the island, and Mr. Roarke (Michael Peña) the main man running the show who specifies that every guest must live out their fantasies to their natural conclusions. They lead the winning contestants into the hotel and explain to them the ""rules"" of the island while showing all of them to their rooms. For the first day, all of the winners get acquainted with one another while the sun is still up by striking conversation to figure out what everyone's fantasy is. Later on that night, everyone splits up and prepares for their fantasies to become realized; all except Brax and J.D. who while exploring the island under nightfall stumble upon a flashy mansion party. The two brothers instantly light up and join the raving festivities. The following day, Mr. Roarke shows the remaining island goers to their respective fantasies. Gwen has a desire to go back in time and accept the marriage proposal she refused so many years ago, Melanie wishes to get revenge on an old bully that tormented her during her high school years, Patrick dreams of enlisting in the army to honor his father who perished on the battlefield long ago. With every guest in their individual fantasy, not all things are as they seem. Strange occurrences and unsavory characters begin popping up everywhere leading to every fantasy linking in unthinkable ways as they all uncover the mystery hidden beneath Fantasy Island.
After the title card of ""Fantasy Island"" passes, we are introduced to one of the most painfully bland casts of characters ever put to screen. Let us first begin with the insufferable duo of Brax and J.D. These two brothers are the absolute worst this film has to offer. Brax and J.D. are two different characters that ultimately share the same exact fantasy (with a few minor preferences) based on the fact that they are brothers, I guess? When looking at the character that is Brax, there is really nothing present of any substance. It is clear that the writers put up a board of random traits, threw some darts, and wherever those darts landed they said ""Hey! We'll give that to Brax!"". Brax is a mess of a character that is designed to fill a number of trite roles but completely fails at selling any of those positions. Ryan Hansen as J.D. is assigned the role of playing the dumb jock dude-bro archetype that has been done a thousand times over. Ryan is given nothing more than some outdated dumb jokes that always fail to land. Next, we have Lucy Hale (no stranger to Blumhouse) as Melanie Cole who is the most juvenile character on the entire roster. Every time Hale parts her lips, she does so to spew one horrible line after the other fed to her by the THREE writers attached to the project. Everything Hale is given is either obnoxious or utterly humorless, and sometimes it is a combination of both. The final two major vacationers are Maggie Q as Gwen and Austin Stowell as Patrick. There really is nothing to say about these two characters other than they are just two simple slices of white bread, plain. Q is given the most ""emotionally"" resonant story but it sadly goes nowhere and winds up feeling empty. Stowell's story is easily the most intriguing of the two with a couple of twists and misdirects sprinkled all throughout that make his fantasy stand out amongst the rest. Their characters do not exactly commit anything egregious, but both actors fail to deliver any breakout performance. In general, every character in ""Fantasy Island"" is absolutely unbearable; everyone across the board is nothing more than dull. However, despite the cast not churning out any stellar performances, the cast is not solely to blame. The majority of my displeasure stems primarily from director (also co-writer) Jeff Wadlow, along with fellow writers Jillian Jacobs and Christopher Roach as these three had the opportunity to create complex and dynamic characters with interesting plots given the source. But, they failed in every respect imaginable that did not leave me laughing or feeling disappointed; I merely fantasized of what I could have done with the time I had just wasted.
""Fantasy Island"" had a marketing campaign that made it appear as though it would be a trippy vacation gone wrong thriller. ""Fantasy Island"" delivers only on the ""vacation gone wrong"" part. Tonally the film is a mess as it is forced to jump from fantasy to fantasy which are all extremely varied. You have a mansion rave, a marriage story, a jungle war, and a retribution tale; none of these fantasies have anything in common which can be viewed as a strength, but when there is no through-line that can competently connect these loose stories, the entire plot falls apart. Instead of taking a deep dive into interesting themes to explore within these diverse fantasies, the film cops out to utilize jump scares and lousy jokes with a healthy side of nonsense as it slowly devolves into an awfully generic action film that fails to accomplish even the bare minimum. ""Fantasy Island"" is a property that laid dormant for nearly three and a half decades (two decades if you count the 1998 television reboot) and it really is a shame because the concept behind the project is extremely unique. Yet, if we receive another dreadfully half-baked reboot in the likes of this film, maybe the ""Fantasy Island"" series should rest for another thirty years.Final Verdict: D-",Fantasy Island

The first half of the movie was bad, but once it moves into the third act and it starts giving answers, it is unbelievable how ridiculous this movie gets. It takes every rule that it establishes and throws it out just so they can have a big twist in the third act. I could forgive most of this if at least it was schlocky fun.

Scenes seemed rushed and transitioned from one to another too quickly as if the editing team had gone a tad trigger happy with the cut tools. The actors didn't seem believable and it was an sorry attempt at a mild horror style comedy that wouldn't seem out of place in an 80's teen movie.

It's not rushing anything, which is surprising in a positive way.The cast is OK but Maggie Q is actually doing quite a good job here. The dialogue is on a few occasions a bit iffy, but never bad.The story idea is great with having an island that fulfills your deepest fantasy but it does need a dark spin. Otherwise you wouldn't have anything to work with for a movie. But it does work and has a really nice flow while watching.Instead of a horror movie this is rather a mystery movie and you keep getting bits and pieces that explain the story and everything feels earned up until the big twist many other reviewers have been complaining about. The inclusion of that story element is only there for shock value and almost ruins the movie. Even characters in the movie see the flaw of the twist which was hilarious to be honest.It then ends rather satisfying so that you forgive that silly twist. However, to me it seems like a missed opportunity to actually do something smart with the story.The movie also includes some nice throwbacks to the original that even I understood after five minutes of research.Overall a fun movie you can sit down with and enjoy.

385,louissouthpaw,Three Mile Island,1,17 April 2020,"I don't blame the actors one bit. It's the writing. Too many plot ""twists"" and the whole ""story"" is badly unfocused. The movie constantly breaks its OWN rules and subjects the viewer to far too many confusing back stories. I liked the TV show and thought this would be fun but the film just fails in so many ways. The cave looks like an obvious movie prop but that's the least of this flick's problems. This unredeemable movie's title should be ""Three Mile Island"" to let us know what a disaster it really is.",Fantasy Island

It's like a cheap day time movie.
Poor acting no plot cheap special effects.By the end you are left wondering what was that all about.
But special mention must go to Michael Peña who walks round with his hands in his pockets & a blank expression on his face the whole time.

390,daisytheunicorn,Listen to the Reviews!!,3,18 February 2020,Went to see this movie opening night despite the bad reviews as they are usually reviewed by people expecting too much from a PG13 teen horror. The movie wasn't as horrible as some people are making it out to be but boyyyy was this movie boring at times. It was more of a Mystery as the only fantasy that was horror was Lucy Hales fantasy. Thought the end twist was somewhat surprising which made me like the movie just a bit more..,Fantasy Island
391,jean-sebas,I'm satisfied,8,19 August 2020,"I was a little scared by the negative comments, but having seen the trailer and very much liking the premiss, I decided to watch it anyways and see for myself. It's not the best movie I ever watched, but it was well made and you get surprised. There are mysteries and clues and I'm glad to have guessed it right before it was revealed. Nicely done. The story keeps you entertained throughout. In other words, the movie succeeded in its task. I learned from this experience that I better follow my gut rather than other people's opinions, at least some times.Also, the story stays well in touch with the rules of the world it presents, in a realistic fashion, which is very good, considering there are many movies who fail miserably at this.",Fantasy Island
392,gwsteinmetz,Very bad,2,20 April 2020,"""Yippeeki-YES""This movie is not good, at all. However it's just one of these movies that you're just thinking that I hate it, it's horrible, I shouldn't like it, but I love it nonetheless.This movie has almost no good qualities. The actors aren't memorable, Michael Peña was miscast, the score is okay which is surprising because Bear McCreary is amazing (Child's Play especially), and the writing was horrible.As mentioned, the characters are horribly written, they're not relatable, they're not real, it's old men writing dialogue for teenage or young adult characters. Several decisions actually made me facepalm and it's because they make horrible decisions that would never happen. The actors as I mentioned, weren't memorable and realistic, and I hated two characters in particular. Also we have some characters that are meant for comedic relief, that didn't work, and then we have characters that are the emotional core for the movie, and we go from drama and then the comedy walks into the room, presenting major tonal issues. The editing was also really bad, it always made weird decisions to either make it ""scary"" or to present comedy in horrible places. Also they have no idea what subtlety is, it's so obvious what was going to happen and then they present it as a huge reveal and you are underwhelmed. I don't want to talk about this anymore, I want to go to sleep.",Fantasy Island

395,FreedomWatchTower,We have to go Back! Or how i stopped worrying and love the Island,5,20 February 2020,"As most of you probably did, i did not wait or thought much about this Film before going in.It all began with an article during the summer of 2019, i read somewhere that some studio is rebooting ""Fantasy Island"" for the Big Screen (or probably for most on the small one).The first thought was ""wasnt this that show from way back???"", and then all came back... I used to randomly watch some episodes from that show when it was on rerun (probably end 90s or early 2K's), that show which featured that Montalaban dude from Star Trek The Wrath of ""Khaaaaan!!!!"" & also that midget french guy from ""James Bond The man with the Golden Gun"".
I never was looking for that show, it always was just on, so when i hadn't anything to do i watched some episodes.
It always was quite entertaining, even though i dont remember any specific episode.Let's skip couple of months from reading about that news during summer of 2K19 to February 2020. Some friends and myself wanted to go watch a film in theater, of course we watched what was on... Guess what.
I everything came back in my memory, weird i thought again.
How weird is it that Hollywood reboots some show most people remember, let alone know at all... An then as a Film???.Having watched the Film i can say i was surprised in positive and negative, who was this for?.
I remembered reading it was supposed to be Rated R and then hastily recut to PG13, the question is why?.
For PG13 it was too dark, most parents wont go in that with their children, and for Rated R its too soft (it only hints at more)... I guess adults will think its some sort of mindless kids/teen flick.Whatever they thought, i still liked it, it was fun and had some interesting ideas and shots... Even though the last act was a wishy-washy muddle till most of the end, which was a Mess... Besides the last 2 Mins (which i wont spoil, even though most people wont get the reference).
It was a beautiful fun semi mess, which i still will recommend. Fun ride like the original mindless Friday the 13th saga, without all-out violence and sex. Go watch it, its probably one of the best date movies you'll see this year (if you want to go to the next Base).5/10 but still fun, its even more creative than what disney will produce the next years.

397,jasonleesmith6,Could've Been A Great TV Show,7,7 February 2021,"I'm actually surprised that there isn't more love for this movie. I just watched it, and while the plot was weak in places, and the pacing moved way too fast over certain elements so that the tension and some of the surprise twists were lost, the concept and the overall story were very compelling. I've always liked Maggie Q as an actress, and, this time, it was refreshing to see her in a non-action role. Michael Pena was good as Mr. Rourke, and the rest of the cast delivered. The biggest fault I have with the movie is that, to me, it seemed like the ideas they were working with were so large that I felt that perhaps it had originally been meant to be a television program, and they had squeezed the ideas down to their bare essentials to fit in a film. I could certainly have seen it as a TV show reminiscent of ""Lost.""Be that as it may, I enjoyed the movie and would watch it again.",Fantasy Island

399,jgarymatthews,With some editing this movie would be twice as good.,7,19 February 2020,"First off, they need to keep this to 1.5 hours, the last chapter felt way to long. The first hour or so is tight, suspenseful, kept me interested. Worth noting there was only 2 of us in the theater on opening night so the pre-reviews kept people away but I say go see it but don't expect Citizen Kane. Maggie Q and Lucy Hale can captivate an audience both very beautiful and easy to watch on screen. Michael Pena holds his own even if the accent was not working. Director should have let him loose but sadly he was restrained in this one. The location was amazing and the cinematography was very well done. Go with some friend and have a good time, its not gory and all, a nice change of pace as one scene has the potential to rival the torture films of the past, thankfully they choose to skip it. If your tired of superhero movies lets support those studios doing something different.",Fantasy Island

402,jasp-official,Confusing,5,16 January 2021,The plot was very confusing. Didn't completely get the concept. I felt they thought the concept would be creative but it was just very confusing and hard to keep up with. Also this movie left me with a bunch of questions like is Michael Penas character the protagonist or antagonist. What genre was this movie. Felt like a pretty weird combination of comedy action and a slight bit of thriller. Overall this is a very forgettable movie. Poorly executed plot. One good thing about the movie despite all of its flaw I can't really say it was boring. It's not memorable and pretty bad but it's definitely not boring. It at least keeps you slightly entertained.,Fantasy Island

The plot was refreshingly unexpected. The movie vibe feels like those movies you watched as a teen.I honestly don't have much complaints about the storyline. Just those parts where you can be with someone who's already dead vs. Those who'd want to relive a moment. And let's not forget, why are the other persons involved in other's fantasies are ""created"" by the island while one character's fantasy has a real person kidnapped for it. BUT we now know that the reason behind that is because it's part of the plot twist of the story.Also, if you like getting vacations for free or from a raffle, you might want to skip this movie, unless you're ready to end up with anxiety of going to a vacation from a raffle after watching the movie. 😜",Fantasy Island

So, to show the dark side interested me. I thought the fantasies worked well and actually enjoyed how they come together. Rourke was very like the original.

I was a ittle sceptical but Michael Pena, Maggie Q are A list actors and I knew Portia Doubleday from Mr Robot. Normally anything averaging in the 4's I give a miss to, but the cast said something and to be frank I was not disappointed.

417,stevenwclarkmil,Not Quite Up To Par!,5,19 May 2020,"Fantasy Island is a dark take on the iconic TV show by the same name (1977-1984). The concept of the movie is fascinating but the exaction did not quite reach expectation. The cast of Michael Pena, Lucy Hale, Austin Stowell, Portia Doubleday delivered great performances but were stifled by lackluster dialog. Maggie Q's performance was even better and her dialog, though weak was delivered with emotion and feeling. Of all, the movie was stolen by two supporting actors, Jimmy O. Yang and Ryan Hansen! These two's humor and delivery set them apart from the rest of the cast and make the move worth watching.Basically, this is a movie to rent if you are bored and can't find anything else on the tube. I don't regret watching it but I do question whether or not I could have take the time to find something better. If nothing else, watch it to laugh at Yang and Hansen's performances.",Fantasy Island
418,dannybearxoxo,WELCOME TO FANTASY ISLAND,6,6 October 2020,Fantasy island is like a really well packaged piece of plastic vomit from the gag store. The movie teeters between seriousness and comedy and isn't for everybody. Fantasy Island was one of those movies that could've been me so much better if they've only tweaked a few things and did it differently but I didn't think it was such a great movie.It have its moments though and a few spots of originality and I will give it that.it is what it is.,Fantasy Island

420,gillianronnie,Surprisingly a very twisted and interesting take with some genuinely bizarre imagery and intensity.,7,12 February 2020,"Most people have already written this film off because they're upset it's a loose adaptation of the old classic tv show and they feel that it should've never been made into a horror film. While it may appear like a desperate attempt at a cash grab from Blumhouse concept wise, It's actually a pretty fun horror film with some bleak subject matter. There are some very sinister sequences that I did not expect in the film and the way they adapted the fantasy aspect is rather intriguing and works fairly well. there are some moments of tropes and clichés that we've all come to be very familiar with from Blumhouse but it still has a great level of vicious intensity. The acting is pretty average overall but the visuals carry the film. Overall it's a solid outing and better than I thought it would be and if people are already hating it just because it's an adaptation of the old TV show I say give it a chance because the way they adapted the fantasy concept is kind of cool.",Fantasy Island

424,brionesb,Lame & a waste of time.,1,15 February 2020,"I rarely feel very compelled to rate bad movies unless they are so bad that I need to tell people to avoid it. This movie is a waste of time & money!If there is anything redeeming I can say about this movie is that it has an interesting concept but it's poorly written and executed. The idea that your deepest fantasies and desires can have dark consequences is something the original TV show explored but with less of a focus on the horror aspect.The problem this movie has it that the overall story doesn't make sense. The way this was put together makes me wonder if the filmmakers were drunk & high and when they wrote and directed this mess. The story starts out well enough but quickly devolves into literal nonsense. The movie tells both the guests of the island and we the audience that only one fantasy can be had and it needs to be played out to its end no matter good or bad. However, because the filmmakers felt the need to be clever, this is quickly discarded for a nonsensically cheap twist that even a five year old would scratch their head at.What's even worse is that they don't even begin to start trying to setup the ending twist(s) until a little over halfway through. Add to this, when the twist occurs, several characters have to mansplain it to everyone because it literally makes no sense whatsoever.Whether or not you saw the original TV series or its remake with Malcom McDowell, DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE! You literally could write your own version of how this story plays out and it would probably wind up being better than this turkey that never should've made it past the pitch to the studio to convince them to release it.",Fantasy Island

The performances were average in most cases and where solid were monotonous. This is a pity particularly in the case of Pena and Rooker (MVP here) who are wasted.

You know they are low quality and production.This movie didn't have a single scary scene, not a single thrill, and not a single funny scene. It was simply bland, empty and uninteresting.A budget of $7 million, and all they could come up with is Michael Pena's worst role in his whole career? Michael Rooker also appeared, only to be replaced by a puppet falling off a cliff.Right from the start, I realized it was a mistake to watch this film, but I decided to sacrifice two hours of my life just to see where it goes. It went to me giving it one star, and that's not something I do very often. If I could I would've given it zero.The whole story is about a group of completely unrelated people arriving on an island where ""everything is possible"". Pardon me, ""nothing is impossible"". They say it at least two thousand times during the movie, just in case the viewer is a complete idiot and didn't get it earlier. After a lot of snake symbols and black goo dropping from random places, we begin to understand that the island isn't the paradise it seems to be, but exploits your deepest fantasies only to turn them into something grim and evil(?) or something like that.I really can't choose whose performance in this movie was the worst. Everything seems just glued together to form somewhat of a story. Characters have no charisma at all, and the main guy - Rourke - is Michael Pena's agent's worst decision of all time. On top of that, all of the actors' and actresses' performances seem like a rehearsal, rather than a $7 million production.I won't even get into details about the awful, gaping plot-holes throughout the movie. Let's just say that it's completely natural for a person who loses their brother, to forgive the man responsible for it just because he had a change of heart. All of that happened in less than 10 minutes of the movie. What?TL;DR:
If you've seen the movie - I'm sorry.
If you haven't - please waste your time doing anything, ANYTHING else.",Fantasy Island

446,summer_rain000,Better than expected,7,8 August 2020,"Much more better than expected.What I expected: It was a long time ago I saw the trailer. Thought that Maggie Q has a small role, but it was actually the main lead. Less horror and more suspense.What I got:
Maggie Q's solid acting, her screen presence is great. The fantasy/story of Nick was actually really touching. Some unexpected plot twist.If you like mysteries, fantasies and suspense. It's a great wacht for a movie night at home with some friends with popcorn!",Fantasy Island
447,PalmTreeCloud,Great summer movie or escapism,8,19 May 2021,"This movie is what it is. It's there to entertain and I thought it did well at that. It's visually pleasing, acting is very good, can be funny, a touch of mild suspense, and has some nice references to the original. It was a great watch and helped with the escapism and entertainment I was looking for. If you are looking for a deep or jump scary movie, you know this is not going to be it, so go in with an open mind, escape, and have fun.",Fantasy Island

450,sparkerd,About nothing fun,9,28 May 2020,"I grew up in the age of Fantasy Island, Gilligan's Island, Love Boat era. While I'll admit I was partial to the latter two, I remembered, the plane boss the plane, and the immaculate gentleman in white welcoming guests to fantasy island. That out if the way, this was a fun movie, we enjoyed it from beginning to end. The negative reviews sound like want to be film critics. There is no deeper meaning or philosophy to take away from this movie, it's just fun. It's meant to be entertainment and it is. What would you say about Top Gun, Footloose, Legend, Labyrinth, The Dark Crystal, Heavy Metal and Gremlins if they came out today? Those movies were not to convey a message but to entertain which they did. Not everything has to be an Oscar or teach you a life lesson. Rant over, I recommend this movie for no cussing, nudity, crudity, or senseless stupidity.

456,bobbyadjah,A movie to waste time. Literally!,2,17 February 2020,"Watched this movie 'accidentally' without reading a synopsis or watching a trailer and I must say, it's a cinematic mess.Now, this movie is supposed to be a horror, comedy and thriller film but struggles at everything. Being a movie adaptation, you'd expect an improvement on the plot, but this movie ended up having the worst movie plot I've seen in a while.The convulated plot makes this movie very difficult to enjoy, in addition to the washed out jokes and terrible acting.My final verdict: Watch this only if you're bored with nothing else to spend your time on. You're guaranteed a laugh, only it'll be satirical.",Fantasy Island
457,seanshillz,The movie tried so hard it ruined itself,4,16 April 2020,The writer of this movie was so scared of this movie being to the extend it ended up bad. They tried to put so many twists in the movie that it ended up confusing itself to nothing.,Fantasy Island
458,adamrosolowski,Want to watch this? Careful what you wish for,2,4 July 2020,"This movie starts with interesting premises. The actors - well, they at least look pretty. However, the plot is awfully broken. And it's not just that this film doesn't know if it wants to be treated a horror or some shallow comedy. It's worse than that. The events just slide in all directions with the director not being capable to keep to any logic or concept. It is as if the script for the movie got stolen or perhaps never got finished and the director left in the middle leaving the actors to improvise. If you have seen the trailer, you have pretty much seen everything there is to watch.",Fantasy Island

465,kanati-2,From a fan of this title in all of it's incarnations,8,15 April 2020,"This was a horror movie with a difference. It built upon a mythology that has mostly been upbeat and happy except for a few darker turns in the 1998 revival. I've always felt it had the potential for a dark twist and this movie did a great job of both paying homage to the original and finding it's own path. Yes, there was some cheese thrown in there as well, and a few plot holes... But overall it was a very good effort and I would greatly look forward to a sequel if there were to be one.",Fantasy Island

I loved this movie! Even though some parts were obvious, it still had a very good twist and kept me glued To the screen the entire movie.

Characters are beyond thin and the film can't seem to decide if it wants to be funny or scary - even attempts to be heartfelt at times (and fails miserably every time).
The always wonderful Maggie Q is wasted in this film as are a few other decent actors. Guess this was all made as an excuse to have this cast spend some time in Fiji and create something that will make us just a little dumber for watching it.",Fantasy Island

473,chester129,Entertaining...mostly.,7,27 September 2020,"Fantasy Island is better than the bad reviews on here would make you think. It is good, but has some problems. It's sort of a remake of the 80's classic TV show, just scarier and bloodier. First the positives, it has some interesting characters. 5 people come to the island to fulfill their fantasies. One lady came to get revenge on her school bully, one lady came to deal with her biggest regret, one guy who is a cop came to enlist in the military, and 2 brothers came to ""have it all."" Some of these were better than others. The lady with regrets was played by Maggie Q...I was waiting for her to kick butt, but never happened. I thought her story was the weakest. The guy who wanted to be in the military meets a family member and it was very interesting. I enjoyed the 2 brothers...they were the comic relief, until one was killed and one made a huge sacrifice.This leads to the negatives. The HORRIBLE plot twist near the end of the movie involving the girl who wants revenge on her bully. It was so ridiculous it actually made me angry. The one in charge, Mr. Roarke, had a weak story arc. The movie was TOO LONG. A movie like this should be 90 minutes. 2 hours was so long, it started dragging. And those characters that couldn't be killed, it was like watching a zombie movie (how many times did we have to keep watching Dr. Torture....over and over and over). And the relationship everyone has with Nick Taylor (a burn victim) is sort of silly.In the end, it is definitely worth a watch (once). It's not a horror film, but definitely has some tense moments. I actually enjoyed the little references to the TV show. Don't expect this to win an Oscar, but don't expect it to win a Razzie either!!",Fantasy Island

It's probably more like a 5 than a 7 but I had to boost it a bit due to the super low ratings. It's a fun little flick. Is it mindless entertainment for a couple hours?

480,experten-1,Directly pleased.,8,10 March 2020,"That rare case where the film far exceeded my expectations. I didn 't expect anything special from this movie initially. Went just to spend time and enjoy exotic locations of the film - shot on the Fiji Islands (by the way, it was on this island that shot ""Return to the Blue Lagoon"" with 15-year-old and already seductive Mila Jovovich) and my favorite actress Maggie Q. And all.
And here, suddenly, a very non-cool plot with interesting turns of the plot. Directly pleased.
It 's got modern fiction with adventures and a bit of comedy.
Although the plot, in my opinion, is very obnoxious, but, apparently, the authors of the film decided that in this case it is better to cross more than not to finish. The film 's actual plot comes from three popular postulates:
1. Be afraid of the dreams! They may be fulfilled, but somewhat not as you expect it to be.
2. We are all responsible for our actions, and this responsibility is irreparable even after a certain amount of time.
3. A person is always given the opportunity to change/correct his Destiny. The main thing is to realize this and make the right decision at the right time.Therefore, in my opinion, the plot of the film turned out to be smart, the plot is quite dynamic, there are several twists, an unexpected ending. Therefore I received sincere pleasure from the film despite quite decent timing - 1h50-min.
And yes, I would love to go to this island. To fulfill your most cherished wish. Although... if there will be Maggie Q at this time it will be not bad already",Fantasy Island

Because it is a B, if not C movie, they don't care.For me, it seemed like a combination of an island horror wanna-be, taking an idea from the first Harry Potter movie.This movie didn't even deserve its runtime, it could have been easily a 1h30min movie.If you watch it till the end, your qestions will be ""what?"", ""huh?"", ""how?"", ""but...?"".",Fantasy Island

The plot is very good and there is a lot of twists and turns. A lot of scary moments and unexpected jumps. The scary element and sci fi resurrection element was really well done. At one point it turned into a ""journey 2 the mysterious island"" quest time thing which I really liked. There's only one thing... the writing choices and lines are a bit weird. There was some confusion which had me scratching my head at times to understand why the plot went certain directions. The whole Lucy Hale sex plot was out of place. Some of the bad guys seems strange and cheesy, and the final ending (which I am not gonna spoil) had me quite confused. Good ending don't worry... but It was weird. Regardless, the laugh out loud comedy and the horror moments had me on the edge of my seat. I was emotionally invested and crying at the sad bits. It's a very good movie, but some of the writing choices were a little weird so I can see how it got bad reviews. Personally I enjoyed it and if you can stomach some gore and gross parts, it's a great comedy/thriller/action adventure/i don't know what genre (lol).",Fantasy Island
485,N-Gentry,Wait for Redbox,2,16 February 2020,"Despite a great cast, this movie deserves its negative reviews. While the film is never boring, I didn't particularly care for any of the characters; the stepbrothers were irritating with their constant high-fives and fraternity brother dialogue; the ""bullied"" young woman seems more angry and bitter instead of victimized, leading us to lack sympathy. The movie becomes tiresome, complicated and painful to sit through. When the end credits rolled, I finished the last of the popcorn and did what I should've done in the first place: watch Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) for the third time.

I'm someone who can get through the worst of the worst movies if there's anything redeemable about them. In this movie.... there just wasn't anything good about it. Spoilers ahead.The costume designer/s failed. Almost nobody's fashion choices for this rugged, rocky island made sense. The attempts at humor failed miserably. JD and T were horrid, and prepare for race jokes including an Asian actor that aren't funny and don't even work in the Family Guy sense. The plot had so many holes that I couldn't begin to keep count. The moment I knew this movie was in real danger was about 5 minutes in, when hugely miscast Mr Rourke stated something like, ""each of your fantasies will begin TOMORROW, after your first sleep!"" and JD and T stated, ""but we haven't been to our rooms yet, help us!"" As every creepy worker ignored their cries, Mr Rourke finally told them, ""ah, that's because YOUR fantasies start right now!""Cue the first of endless rules stated and then broken and twisted to push the story forward. Storylines are so quick and don't make sense. No one thinks to question if they're even safe. Apparently on this island you can take a two day walking trip (in leather heels and sundresses with no food, preparation, or phone charger) one way which takes you about 3 minutes to return back to once it's convenient for you. Apparently some characters sleep for ages and are constantly in bed or seen getting into/out of bed multiple times with glorious close ups of sun on their faces whilst others loudly party with upwards of 60 nearly naked ravers just a few grassy steps away. I know, I know, it's supposed to be some magical fantasy island.. but that's its problem. Is this island a fantasy, a horror, a travel back through time, a revenge plot, a fun wish come true, a place where random men put on sweaty masks and shoot at people for a couple hours straight? Are they sea snakes or dead bodies? Everyone hears gun shots. Everyone tells you they hear gun shots. Where did Blondie's evil ego go? Was Merle the obviously-not-a-PI in on the whole thing? The color of the actual scenes was horrible. Exposition who? DR. TORTURE? Others have talked about the surprise twist at the end. I won't. Just don't see this movie.",Fantasy Island

From now on, I am going to do a careful casting check before going to a theater movie....doing so would have saved me from this stinker. It's purported to be horror, but it's too absurd to be horror.

This is bad at a new scale! I watched the movie and honestly aked myself, if the ""twists"" were intentional, or just a bad afterthought... The Ending made no sense at all! It looked like the writers quit mid-movie and they hired children to scribble the rest. What a Nosedive! And i am no nostalgia freak, couldn't care less of the source material, even if it filled parts of my childhood. Not even Pena could save this piece of trash overproduced lazy Movie!

I grew up with Fantasy Island, my family watching it religiously every Saturday night, right after the Love Boat. Usually a trio of vignettes, all of them morality tales in one form or another. This movie recreates the feel of the show perfectly for me.Which, to be honest, was somewhat of a disappointment. Re-envisioning this as a horror seemed like genius to me, but this was so watered down, it played like a made for TV movie. If you're familiar with the original Fantasy Island, you can guess the oh, so predictable pattern of the movie within the first 20 minutes. Maybe less. There are no surprises, no stand out performances, nothing new brought to the table. Just a stale rehash of standard TV fare. Not the worst movie in the world, but, if you never see this movie, your life will not be the less for it.",Fantasy Island

Who would have thought that that they could turn a campy 70's TV show into a modern horror film? This movie features a likable cast of characters and an intriguing plot with a twist ending that will stay with you for days! It just goes to show that you don't need a huge budget and A-list actors to make a great movie. The only reason I gave it 9 stars is that it could have been a little longer.

I was curious to see this one even with all these reviews. I didn't know anything going in... But Blumhouse has made better films so ""why not""?For starters. The film jumps right in, love it. What you see is what you get. But... The writers didn't understand the script they'd written when it was finished. I'd figured out the twist that it would be just like they showed mid 2nd act ""one of them wanting a fantasy do-over because of that guy who got burned. Nick."" But the problem by doing a plot twist in your third act (and as a screenwriter, I can tell. Believe me.) It's that you have the the check the script from front to back, again and again... With a fine tooth comb. It's very, very clear that the writers failed that task and were going for a rushed finish.I get that you want to pay hommage to a TV Show from years ago because you ""borrowed"" the title for your film. But if that's your main goal... Write the story structure and twist as effectively to fit that goal. They clearly knew what Blumhouse thing they wanted to do with it... But they've got their hairs crossed by wanting both. At a point you've gotta decide as a writer... ""Which darling am I have to going to kill""?

534,mariam1701,Got me thinking but rushed ending,7,20 February 2020,"The ending irritated me because I feel like it undermined what could have been a great thought provoking Movie. Now to what I loved about the movie:
The movie explores the human side of regret, resentment and how we become entrapped in the past, so much so that we lose our present.we are prisoners of the past, resentful of all the wrong done to us. We are captives of our own imagination when we dream about different outcomes of past events. We are slaves to our minds when it starts asking What if.....?every choice we make in life , is a crossroad and every-time you make a different choice a storyline is revealed and another alternative remains unexplored. The alternative becomes an untold story that disappears into thin air.
When we think of regret ... when we look back and say I wish I made a different choice , we are transfixed on that one immediate effect that we want to change; But we rarely think of what comes after, the butterfly effect of that choice. How this one diverge in the road will change the whole story because It will change all of the next chapters of your life. you wont be the same person you are today, you wont be in the same place you are right now. It Could be better or could be far worst.Now the question : given the chance, would you rather accept your reality or go back , change that one choice and risk it all?Now if you risk it all and get to see the other outcomes to your story , do you imagine you would say:
hell yeah I am so glad I rewrote this whole book! I have finally let go of all regret
Or
I hate this, this is terrible I 100% prefer my original reality. I am sorry. I accept my original fate. I want to go back ?",Fantasy Island

2. Sounds and effects are slightly better job.
3. The most important part which is story line. Is full of inconsistency & conveniences, specially when the writer suddenly decided to rush it at the end.
with a Cliché ENDING which basically breaks down to: revenge is bad and the revenger shouldn't make it at the end of the movie.

But I try to forget the plot and focus on other aspects. If you want to focus on the protagonists, you lose time, since you cannot feel anything, be it empathy or dislike for them, because there are so many stories that connect in such a coarse way that it almost seems like a joke in bad taste. Ok, I focus on the island ... Where is the juice that the damn island could give?

575,alexxanderrdarth,Not as bad as some people may think,8,28 February 2020,"Yes, of course, this genre of movie, with this kind of story will never win the Golden Globe or the Oscar, but it is the kind of movie you would watch after a hard day of work with your partner or your buddies to relax a little bit.I have to admit that this movie exceeded my expectations, because I was expecting a careless and predictable story with cheap jumpscares. Even though the movie had very very few jumpscares that were not really that creepy, the story was pretty well made and I did not predict the multiple twists it presented.One of the most interesting things about the movie is the way how the stories of the main characters intertwine with each other in a way that could actually be believable, with a person that somehow connects all the protagonists.So, if you are the kind of person that wants to have a good time with his friends, just to relax and also enjoy a movie, you should give it a go. I was not disappointed and I feel like you will not be either.",Fantasy Island
576,NitinSisode,Fantasy Island Review One Time Watch by Nitin Sisode,6,14 February 2020,"Fantasy Island Review One Time Watch by Nitin Sisode
The director has attempted to interlace the realities and dreams of the characters, yet the progress is jagged. This leads to confusion and inconsistencies. One cant make out if it's a fantasy, thriller or a horror movie. Jimmy O. Yang and Ryan Hansen are comical and best part of the movie. Lucy Hale looks breathtaking. Rest of the cast does fair job.
Coming from various backgrounds and with varied wishes a group of aspirants leave on an excursion to visit the hotel that vows to give one's most profound fantasy under the observation of its wary supervisor - Roarke (Michael Peña). However every individual finds a dream and there is no halting the round until the fantasy arrives at its end.
The idea of an advanced genie situated in a rich hotel seems more engaging. In the beginning Fantasy Island appear a brilliant horror-thriller. But later it becomes aimless tale leaving the audience with many speculations.
Fantasy Island starts on a promising note but second half disappoints.",Fantasy Island
577,GhilleSuit,Thanks to everyone that said do not read the 1 stars.,7,25 August 2020,This movie do not deserve an Oscar but neither the 1 star reviews. I mean i really liked the movie. The movie had a big problem if you ask me. The characters. I didn't really care if they died or survived tbh. Cause i didn't get to know any of the characters. But the plot was great. Really entertaining. 7 Stars!,Fantasy Island
578,eidolonx-25075,Truly Dreadful,3,11 March 2020,"I couldn't make any sense of the ridiculous plot and the overuse of the word ""Fantasy"" was irritating.Maggie Q still sizzles at 40 though.",Fantasy Island
579,natekenopic,Awful Movie,2,21 April 2020,"This movie was painful to watch. Almost stopped half way through, but I stuck with it and watched the rest, and man do I ever regret that. Lots of plot twists, which in some movies are great like Shutter Island but these were just plain stupid. They also chose very strange music for a horror movie that didn't fit in at all. In conclusion this movie was a huge waste of time with bad acting, and an even worse story.
I DO not recommend watching this movie, so if your considering watching it, you should save your time and money by watching a different movie.",Fantasy Island

It keeps you guessing; but most importantly, it's a nice looking and very fun movie.It sometimes falls on the camp-ish side of things and the plot can get a bit contrived, so I get the bad reviews, but still, you can really appreciate it for what it is and just enjoy the ride.Not really spoiler, but ish if you're very finicky about them:
I'd say the last third is its weakest, but the build up is really nice. There is one missed opportunity which I think might have fallen on the edit room.",Fantasy Island

My friend asked me if I'd watch it again for a million dollars & I really had to think about it.

If you go expecting a Blum House Film you will love it. The plot twist is perfectly done. The villain is kept secret. Yes, it is formulaic but they aren't chasing oscars here.

I was going to go to bed but ended up putting this on, and it kept me up. It kept me guessing, and I was surprised more than once.
Whether or not people are judging this based on the TV show I don't know, but I'd never seen that.
There were decent actors, the cinematography was nice to look at, the storyline was good and I would definitely have watched a sequel.

And one thing i love is the mysteries about the island uncovered one by one, and i always tried to guess where this will be going. But finally the conclusion i waited for, i don't know what to say but it just really bland, unsatisfying and i disappointed.

mixed with a bit of giligans island and IT. The trailer looked ok.
I read bad reviews and thought, no It cant be that bad.

Everyone has a fantasy and wants to live it out. Things go from good to horror on each fantasy and the effects were really good. I think that this could have been better with some different actors, Mr Roark was poorly cast as I think he could have been better portrayed by a taller, more refined actor.Some of the scenes were fun, lots of action and had interesting bits but overall it was not what I was expecting from this movie based on the tv show.",Fantasy Island

620,mexi_babyboy,What did I just watch!? Don't watch.,2,15 February 2020,"This movie is so convaluted. Is this a horror, a comedy, a drama or a revenge mystery? This movie is so laughably terrible! The acting is terribly bad, the dialogue is extremely bad and at times this movie wanted to flex its
'woke' muscles by inserting social commentary as well.Their is no clear motivation of who is behind the evil, because it bounces back and fourth between what 'he wants' 'she wants' or what the owner of F. I. wants. At times it felt like it wanted to be an action movie and it carried different tones throughout the movie (which I think dragged and soul have been way shorter) and even during the second act it felt it wanted to be like 'Indiana Jones' and go on a mission to :destroy'the Island' The LACK of exposition really infuriates the audience watching because it makes it hard to follow.Terrible movie. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because of its amazing location shots and georgeous setting. They wasted Micheal Pena and Rookers character. Michael Penas character had a strange accent that disrupted the energy and took you out of the flow of the film.Do yourself a favor and make sure to make your fantasy be to avoid this movie at all costs.",Fantasy Island

So if the directors planned on doing that then yay they did. But I remember that show being terrible.Con - Then mix in some Baywatch for scantily clad females and guys in speedos and some ""made for TV"" acting and characters and you have the basics of it.Then tell the writers to go watch Scream and try and come up with a movie with more plot twists than one of those twisty roads in Switzerland and you basically have it.To be fair this movie started out pretty good despite ripping on the intelligence level of most Instagram Influencers and when it was all about the fantasies it was ok - but then in the second half everything started falling apart and it was twist after twist after twist.Then we get to the special effects - I've seen better on You Tube done by 23year olds in their moms basement.So yeah there you have it - if you want to take that special someone to the movies whereupon you will sit in the back row and ignore pretty much everything on screan then hell yeah go for it.

Has nobody noticed that lots of people go to this island and don't come back?Too many plot holes to mention but the one at the end just makes no sense at all. When she is acting out her initial fantasy why does she need to act it if she was behind the revenge plot all along?

Unlikeable characters that talk to themselves.30 minutes in and nothing of substance has happened, which is often the case when a movie starts with a short out of context action scene.Failed jump scares a plenty.45 minutes and I'm skipping.A mixture of bad acting and overacting.Idiot son wants dad to die.1 hour in and I just want everyone to die and at this point the stories start to overlap.Michael Rooker might be able to save the movie...nope he's dead.The old trope of hey I have a grenade drop your weapons is painful to watch.Zombies?

After reading the reviews of people saying ""give this movie a chance"" and ""don't judge by the score"" I went into this film with a completely open mind, just wanting to kill some time. What a mistake this was.The idea behind the plot is fairly interesting, a magical island that can grant you the power to create a fantasy based on your own desires. However, for the characters in this plot their desires are so pointless and literally don't make any sense. This leads to the ""fantasy's"" becoming one big mess. It may as well be called Regret IslandThere isn't much to say about the plot other than there isn't one. I'm not sure what's more laughable, the attempt at developing the characters or the acting itself. The sense of this film having no direction at all is overwhelming, you never feel anything progress.

651,maxswami,Not a 10 but I thought I'd offset the bad reviews,10,13 September 2020,"This movie has bad reviews because of fans of the original show not getting an identical remake (that's what I assume at least). If you're a fan of imagination, and well-thought storytelling mixed with a little horror element; this movie will tickle your fancy. It has a well-needed theme/moral that people these days could take note of. Redemption, forgiveness, letting go of the past in order to have a future.",Fantasy Island

But nevertheless looked promising.. until the movie got further and seemed to lost pace and the writers didn't quite know which direction it should headed to making it a twister game with random twists and turns... bringing us to the end that looked to be rushed off as the easiest 'logical' solution to this tragedy, sorry to see one of my fav actors in it but Michael Peña gave a solid performance alongside 1 or 2 others..",Fantasy Island

But as the movie progressed, it got worse and worse and finally collapsed into a completely convoluted mess. Once again, another movie is released that spares no expense except when hiring writers.

This movie was so much better than I expected it to be. It keeps you pulled in entire time, pretty fast paced and it wraps everything up perfectly.

668,julianschneider-46108,Top 5 worst movies I've ever seen,1,14 February 2020,I felt like I was watching a trash movie but there were no funny scenes at all. The story behind this movie may sound interesting first but it was so poorly produced. The whole movie contained scenes which were absolutely non-sense. But this was not all: The plot-twist. Even the 8-year who wrote this s*** must felt embarrassed. The acting was also so bad. Defintely one of the worst movies of the last 10 years. 1/10 because 0/10 is not possible,Fantasy Island
669,kitkohl,This movie was awwwwful!,1,17 April 2020,"I didn't have high expectations for this movie, but it was worse than I expected. I am a fan of Michael Pena, but even he wasn't great in this movie. The plot, the writing, and the acting were all very poor. Spoiler: I also was disappointed than Sloan made it out with the rest of them as I did not find her to redeem herself or have any redeeming qualities. And I don't buy that Melanie, being the villain, would have saved her.",Fantasy Island
670,malphrusmm,Is it cheesy? Yes! Is it entertaining? Yes!,6,28 February 2020,"I went to see this in theaters with a group of girls with very low expectations. I simply wanted an entertaining watch, something fun and a little suspenseful to see with some friends. And that's exactly what it was. It by no means was the best movie I've ever seen, nor did I expect it to be. But it got the job done for a quick entertaining watch.As far as the plot goes.. it was a neat concept (taken from a series in the 70s that I've never seen) but I feel like I left not really understanding the island. The ending left me feeling like the characters didn't necessarily tie up loose ends. The whole point was to stop the evil happening on the island but in the end, the island is going to continue operating??Overall though, it's a fun watch with friends! Just have low expectations!",Fantasy Island
671,siebertb,Got to raise the rating.,10,16 April 2020,This is not a 10 but it is a solid 6. 6 is the number that I try to find a decent film. This film is at least a 6. I don't know why the overall low scores. Read the other reviews that feel the same as I do. It's a fun watch. Enjoyable,Fantasy Island
672,donaldvanesch,"Good concept, poor execution.",2,6 December 2020,"The movie started out mysterious and I was kind of curious where it would take me. But it got more and more ridiculous while the plot unfolds. I didn't liked the acting but not as much as I disliked the writing. Good concept, but sadly, poorly executed.",Fantasy Island
673,pinkprincessbella,Mixed Thoughts,4,16 April 2020,"Let me say this review is based on my personal opinion. The movie has its highs and lows. There were moments I did enjoy. It was a bit of a roller coaster ride for me , meaning that there were many scenes that in my view didn't deliver that point of being an amazing movie & parts where I would lose a bit of interest. Being a low budget film may be part of the reason.
For instance some of the acting was bad, while others were better. Maggie Q delivered good acting, Lucy Hale & Michael Pena were ok, and for the small part that Parisa Fitz Henley had she delivered good realistic acting. In my honest opinion though the rest didn't. The story line and idea of the movie was pretty interesting and entertaining, but through out the movie some scenes just didn't make complete sense. And I don't really enjoy having to put way too much thought or bits of confusion of why things happened the way they did in movies I watch. It's good to keep the audience guessing but it needs to be done right. Some parts to me were very cliche. Especially towards the end. This movie also is marked to be a horror/Thriller, the thriller part I can somewhat get, however the horror not so much. Maybe because I know and really love horror movies, this movie was not scary to me at all.
So in my conclusion, the concept was good, however there were many things could of been a lot better.",Fantasy Island

Everything was bad: writing, acting, cinematography. It tried to be like 5 different movies in one and failed 5 different times.
The plot also created its own set of rules and constantly broke them. None of it made any sense.

There isn't a single likeable person in the entire film.
The acting is disappointing and the plot does not make ANY sense.
Fun is of course subjective but i did not hear a single person laughing in the theater for any of the jokes.
The movie is tagged as horror but there is absolutely no horror in this film, it isn't unsettling or anything, all it does is a few jumpscares that wouldn't even
scare an 8 year old.So yeah it's not a comedy, it's definitely not a horror, and the plot makes 0 sense especially after the plot twist that kills every potential the film had until that point.I did not believe the bad reviews but i definitely should have.

who ""it"" was but really didn't.What would you change if You had the chance to?Such a thought provoking question that was answered in such a thrilling way. While also creating the prologue to one of my favorite classic shows!

Like she was a little girl again totally taken in by the show. She just glowed. And I knew my mom would've wished something of her own if she had the chance and it would be something so humble and tear jerking because my mom is an Angel straight from heaven.I loved this telling of such an iconic show! Also it has my home girl Maggie Q! ....which y'all definitely should've given her a gun scene....we all expect her to be a bad ass Nikita anyway and we love it so just let us have a kick ass female please and thank you.Don't know where are these negative reviews are coming from but it seems like they have no context for greatly woven stories or reverence to classics.I wouldn't be mad if this was extended into a series with a rotating cast of a amazing actors.

I went in to this movie with high hopes as the concept peaked my interest. Yet I was nervous for the outcome, only because a lot of times these types of films can come out as cheesy and a little boring. Right off the gate I have to say I don't know much about this cast outside of Michael Rooker and Michael Peña. Not saying everybody else are globally recognized talent; It's just I'm not familiar with their work. I though the cast did a great job with the use of their emotions and with their understanding of who the characters actually are. The island is as beautiful as a paradise that you could find with absolutely breathtaking scenery (I have to include the beautiful models in this film as well). I got about halfway through, fully invested in the story, before I felt that the film started to drag on. I don't know if it's just how I feel with horror films but me getting bored halfway through one is usually a reoccurring action. Once it started to drag, in my opinion, every time they would tease an ending and shock you it just became more tiresome to watch. Then we got to the ending.... While the ending made sense it was completely from left field and just felt forced to me. I feel like they did one too many twists and it left the ending feeling like somewhat of a joke. While the film did have a nice conclusion, if the ending they had was left out then the film might have felt more complete to this viewer. Overall this film was ok, and had some aspects that I thoroughly enjoyed. I have to rate this film 2 1/2 out of 5 (5/10). You are either going to really enjoy or give this film a hard ""meh, it's alright.""",Fantasy Island

Halfway through the film, you already realize that the script is trying, abruptly, to introduce a secondary plot.

I think this was very unique, not many movies are made about islands that manifest your fantasies in a dark, twisted way. Despite anything it should get points for creativity.
Secondly, it was thrilling, and kept you thinking about who was behind jt all, and managed to surprise me completely. Obviously with a group of 5-6 main characters it is hard to flesh out all of their development but even that did a good job and managed to get a few emotional moments.
In conclusion, campy, gimmicky horror is a style of its own and doesn't deserve to be rated badly.",Fantasy Island

This so-called ""horror movie"" contains about as much horror as an armful of declawed kittens! Poor storyline, terrible script, horrendous acting ... oh, wait a minute, I guess it really is a horror movie after all ... or should I say ""horrible movie!"" Several instances of unrealistic mood. A few times, characters who were supposedly desperately running for their lives from a killer, suddenly stand around totally relaxed, acting as if they'd just finished a bottle of wine and an hour long full body massage. On the Stink Scale, this flick deserves a ""pungent rotten eggs caked into the sweaty, never washed hockey jersey laying in a ripe dumpster"" rating!

749,hscrawford,"Even with a written synopsis, this movie goes like a swirl that has no real start or end",3,27 February 2020,"I started off very interested in it until I realized how this movie is as though 20 plus people added their two cents(script ideas) then we're told to make five different story lines each, from there someone haphazardly did not weave it together never giving it a main plot line. It was though someone just began telling a scary story and was in a huge circle of people in high school and the person next to the last person talking begins by creating a whole new story that also has no begin/mid/end/point to it and so they tell five more before the next person begins telling their version of five different stories ....just when you think It had a point it does not...and like someone rambling who was also on speed that's how this seems to play out.
Either watch when you're able to not pull away and miss one detail or accept someone got paid too good to out out what potentially COULD HAVE BEEN a great movie. The concept was good if only the writers didn't feel the need to throw so many different stories that didn't connect. They even had zombies that were quote ""reanimated zombies"" that were formerly part of a drug cartel that was part of someone's negative side effect of the fantasy they chose.
If ones has ADHD or ADD an even worse selection bc even you won't be able to understand the twists and turns as you contemplate what drugs the writers/the producers were on. As I'm not sure how one explains this movie to have even gotten funds for it.
It's gave me a headache just trying not to explain it. I even saught other people's opinions as well as a plot summary.(trust me, in this case reading the plot will NOT mess the movie up Nor will it provide clarity except to explain what I've been talking about in this status.
You could read it a few times and still not know what the heck is going on WHILE physically watching the movie...damn out of breath lol

I can understand the bad ratings if you were expecting a horror movie but as someone said, it's more adventure in a way.I am a fan of the 70s fantasy island show which is a cheesy flix about people coming to have their deep desire fulfilled but realising that their deepest fantasies doesnt cover the hole that they seek and learning from that lesson. I feel the movie stayed true to that which I loved.I found the twist at the end a bit crappy and poorly done as the killer story did not make sense.Not the best movie ever but a decent movie",Fantasy Island
752,gregorym-97576,It was decent until the lazy plot twist,7,1 March 2020,"I went into this blind, and was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I was expecting some cheesy horror film that abuses jump scares, but it was more psychological and I liked that. The characters had interesting backstories and inner demons that showed up in their fantasies. Mr.Roarke had the most interesting backstory, and I really enjoyed him. The plot followed all the different characters and their development throughout the movie and them dealing with the past and learning how to move on with their lives. I also love the idea of fantasy being one thing in one's head, but playing out completely differently if it were real. It pushes a message of don't loose yourself in your fantasies.However, the writer rushed the third act with a dumb plot twist. Towards the end I thought each of them were going to face their inner demons in their physical forms as that was where the movie seemed to be doing. However, it reveals it was one of the main characters fantasy to get them to fantasy island and have their fantasies kill them? What? It ruined the overall message of the movie... The end did do some good things with Mr.Roarke and his character ark, and Patrick as well. However, that is not enough to justify the ridiculous plot twist at the end.",Fantasy Island

Went to this movie for my anniversary date, glad we've been together for 10+ years so we could just laugh off the terrible result of this film, otherwise it would've for sure been a recipe for a disaster date-night!

It has daddy issues, bully payback, and mostly, ""I wish I could do it all over again"" undertones that make you think about your own mistakes that you wish you could reset. It pulls on your heart strings, yet very funny. It's joyful, yet creepy. The cinematography is outstanding. A plethora of beautiful perfect models in bikinis doesn't hurt either. It dragged just a tad at the very end but it was so worth it. Especially when they reveal the nostalgic throwback at the end. Brilliant!!

798,henriksoderlund,Garbage! Dont believe the good reviews..,1,16 February 2021,"This movie is a joke, bad actors and story. This was one of the worst movies i have even seen. Dont believe the good reviews.Do not waste your time on this mess.",Fantasy Island
799,eupnhzvf,This movie had so much potential!,4,9 March 2021,"This movie has so many amazing things going for it in the beginning, your mind takes you on its own fantasy in how this 'horror' could really go.Half way in you come to the realisation that its turning into something that's a lot more narrow minded then what it's really capable of.You know that one character in a movie that acts a certain way the entire time, then they turn and it doesn't add up in how they were previous to why they turned and how they did? This happens massively and in the most ridiculous way.Also if your looking for horror, this is more so psychological. Don't expect gore.I've only rated this 4 stars because I loved it up until half way.",Fantasy Island
800,xvvbhv,So awful it's genius,1,22 March 2021,"On a sliding scale of complete rubbish to brilliance, both ends of the scale are worth attention. This is so bad, it's genius, I laughed more than I have in a full COVID year. Thank you. What an absolute gem. I will watch it again ... but still score it 1 out of 10. If I could have given it a 0 ... I would have. Movie history ... fabulous x",Fantasy Island
801,letsecretsbesecrets,Not amazing but not awful,6,13 June 2021,"I enjoyed it somewhat, not too memorable but it is a pretty good time killer, the characters are cast well and are enjoyable. Plus, it is heartfelt at times, the ending is kind of sweet.",Fantasy Island
802,leealex-85089,"Great idea of a movie, but, execution was mediocre at best",6,12 June 2021,"The idea of this movie is excellent and definitely great in attracting an audience. Unfortunately, the storyline midway onwards was really confusing, perplexing and sometimes doesn't make sense. I ignored the bad reviews but, still find the storyline quite poor.If this same movie idea is directed by ""A"" grade director, I think it would be amazing at the box office.",Fantasy Island
803,brandonbball-48106,"Great ""remake""!",9,22 July 2021,"This movie isn't like any of the movies you've seen before. If I had to categorize it, I would say it's an action-mystery thriller. It's not a real horror movie, it's got very little shock value.The cast does really well, they all play to their strengths from other movies. A lot of twists and turns, although some of them you can see coming a mile away. The movie does keep you guessing as to how it's going to end.As long as you realize this movie isn't a remake of anything, and you go into it not looking for some scary horror movie, I think you'll enjoy this.",Fantasy Island
804,johncosper,Fun to watch.,7,5 June 2020,"I enjoyed this very different take on an old concept. At first I thought Mr Roark was terribly miscast but Michael Pena Earned my respect. It's a popcorn movie - not classic cinema , but that's ok for me.",Fantasy Island

807,orion127,Is it April fools?,1,20 November 2020,This was terrible! You expect a lot of horror movies to be weak on the plot but this was one of the worst.It's not even laugh out loud bad - just plan old rubbish,Fantasy Island

809,allexinno,American cliche!,4,18 October 2020,"I really don't understand why now, in almost every movie, they have to put a white, asian, black, latino & all other races cast. They just don't connect at the real level, from a viewers point. Everything feels so forced & fake this way.

This is a great spin on the show and being on the big screen, they were able to kick it up a notch.

820,leighaston,no idea why people giving this bad reviews?,7,16 April 2020,"Thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and have absolutely no idea why people are giving bad reviews ... its almost like some haters have been paid, have a grudge, or using industry favours or something in order to bring this movie down? Kinda opposite of when a very very bad indy flick gets 9/10 by all cast, crew, and family members voting, lol ... and yes ... this happens.
Id give this movie an easy 6/10 ... or 6.5",Fantasy Island
821,jkmeyer724,Entertainment for its own sake!,9,20 August 2020,"I really liked this! It took the premise of the original show and gave it a sneaky, dark little nudge.
Blumhouse is always good for a ""turn down the lights and get lost in the fantasy"" kind of movie and this one is no exception. It's not an award winning, groundbreaking storyline but it does entertain, and isn't that the point of a horror movie? The characters are interesting, the little hints are subtle but there if you look.
It's a fun movie, so enjoy it and don't be dissuaded by the reviewers who took it too seriously...or themselves.",Fantasy Island

823,bluekittydaemon,"Fun film, great homage to the show",9,15 February 2020,The tv show always had an undercurrent of tension with Roark and this beautifully brings it to the surface. Michael Piña stepped into Ricardo Montalbán's shoes and I didn't think that was possible.,Fantasy Island

829,izabellagrabka,Better than the rating!!,6,11 May 2020,Honestly I have no idea why it's got such a low rating on here. Obviously it's not greatest horror of the decade but it's an alright Blumhouse production with plot twist at the end. I honestly didn't expect it and had fun watching it - didn't check time throughout which happens to me sometimes. Worth a watch,Fantasy Island

The performances range from akwardly funny to kind of good and the story is all over the place. The twists and turns makes it quite a fun watch, but don't expect anything thought provoking or insightful. After a slow start it speeds up and keeps an overall good pace, expect for the way too long and many emotional scenes (they really ham it up with the score too). Overall a pretty bad movie but the self aware tone and over the top story makes it a fun experience.",Fantasy Island

There is certainly some weird stuff going on that is hard to explain, but this is Fantasy Island where anything could happen. At that point, I found myself thinking, ""Wow, this is so much better than the trailers. I really thought this was going to be bad"".But then, the twist that came out of nowhere. Really bad choice from the writers. I liked the movie well enough, but a different choice would have made this a much better movie.",Fantasy Island

840,gabitosd311,What on earth?!,3,4 March 2020,"The problem here is that its not earth. Nothing on here follows rules, but instead of following for a more thriller and through provoking approach it seems like the writers just chopped up different scenarios just to make it fit into one big story.

Firstly the movie with all the effects (like when the ""dead villain"" turns into a zombie) looks like it was recorded and created by amateurs. Acting was terrible and the story also. So unrealistic and the story was soo booring. I can't believe that Michael Pena even decided to accept the offer to participate in this movie.

NOTHING.No plot, no meaningful ending, no explanation...Who were the creatures? why is the snake a symbol? why did the main character (I don't even remember her name, that's how uninterested I was - short haired blonde) show that she got her fantasy by torturing her bully and then changed up her story in the end saying it wasn't her fantasy? THEN WHY DID SHE RECORD IT IN THE FIRST PLACE?In my opinion, the writers and directors and whoever is involved had an idea in the beginning of the story.... then decided to change it up a bit to spice it up due to laziness.... but miserably failed.

853,felipepaiva-55566,A Great Modern B-Movie,6,16 April 2020,"There's this odd trend lately, about taking beloved circa 1970's properties and twisting them into a horror movie. But unlike The Banana Splits Movie, this works really well, better than it should.In a sort of accidental, decidedly Blumhouse-ish way, Fantasy Island is elevated precisely because of it's connection to the eponymous TV series, weaving a plot out of the many dark theories about the show that have surfaced online since it's original run. The ending disappoints, sure, but after seeing the movie I was left with the warm, sweet realization that even a horror reboot of a 70's show that nobody asked for could be exciting and creative.",Fantasy Island

862,ursulasmit,Horrible,2,7 March 2020,"The best part of this movie was the song by Jared Lee at the end credits, the worst part was well, the rest.
It's like someone took a bunch of half thought out ideas and merged them together without finishing anything.
The character development of the characters are just cringe worthy, and half thought out concepts executed poorly by the actors and the screenplay. Then the ridiculously lazy plot twist at the end completely spoils the vibe of the movie.
Cinematography wise it was okay, nothing special, but good, along with the location. The actors had a few moments where I seriously thought the emotion they portrayed did not match the setting or the situation realistically. There's also nothing remotely scary or funny about this, so I don't know how this can pass as either genre? The villain's motivation for all of this is because a mean girl in high school bullied her and she couldn't go on a date with a stranger? Are you kidding me? Did a melodramatic 15 year old write this? I really, really wouldn't recommend this.",Fantasy Island

864,darwinh11,Great Movie should not have been tied to series,7,22 February 2020,I did read the negative reviews and understood what the movie was before I went. They should have called it the Horror of Fantasy Isle and not used the names from the TV show and the ratings would be in the 6's. So don't stop from seeing the movie if you read the negative reviews because you know this is a horror comedy going in. A high percentage of the people that rated it negative are rating it because it is not what they expect of the happy Fantasy Island TV Show. I took the positive reviews and took 2 people to the movie and we all enjoyed it.,Fantasy Island
