0,bkoganbing,A Young Man's game,7,12 July 2012,"Unless you are going to go into the business end of it like Matthew McConaughey does male stripping is definitely for those just entering legal majority and a bit beyond. You get old mighty quick in the game as Channing Tatum in the title role realizes. He's got a day job and he's saving his money to start a business.On that day job is Alex Pettyfer who hasn't got it as together as Tatum does. So when Tatum brings him into the male strip club to work for McConaughey, young Pettyfer becomes an instant star. His sister Cody Horn is concerned for him because he's also a bit of screw-up. She hopes that Tatum will keep him somewhat in line. She kind of likes Tatum herself.A person I know who is in this line tells me Magic Mike was better than he thought it would be. Both of us were prepared for something truly trashy and Magic Mike wasn't that at all. The characters were both real and engaging though if you want to see some erotic male dancing than this is a movie that will provide.I'd check this out, but don't bring the kiddies.",Magic Mike
1,SnoopyStyle,not as fun or energetic as I expected,6,28 December 2014,Mike Lane (Channing Tatum) is a roofer by day and stripper by night. Joanna (Olivia Munn) is his outgoing sex partner. He dreams of making custom furniture. He gets saddled with college dropout Adam (Alex Pettyfer) who got the roofing job on Craigslist. Adam is an aimless slacker sleeping on his sister Brooke (Cody Horn)'s couch. Mike takes Adam under his wing hustling and then throws Adam out onto the dance floor. Dallas (Matthew McConaughey) runs the strip club and the troupe called Kings of Tampa.Director Steven Soderbergh gives this movie his indie sensibilities. The movie isn't as energized as I thought it would be. It's grungy with longer scenes. The music is restricted mostly to the clubs and montages. It leaves an overall sense of sadness. He also saturates the movie with a yellowy color which adds to the depressed feeling. Channing Tatum is solid and McConaughey is McConaughey. Pettyfer is a bit too cold and distant. Cody Horn is a bit cold too which is great as the older sister but not so great as the love interest. Olivia Munn actually brings out a fascinating character. I just expected more flash and less coldness.,Magic Mike
2,kosmasp,Getting to the bottom of it,7,3 January 2013,"Like the strippers here, the main plot/theme is disguised. Yes you will see men stripping, but it's not just a movie with Dudes stripping. The central thing is a man trying to find himself and carrying someone else along for the ride. While this is based on Channing Tatums own life, I have no idea how much of what we see in this movie happened like it is portrayed. Or even if he plays ""himself"".That's not important though and while I am surprised to see this in many Top Ten or 20 lists of the year 2012, the movie does deliver a strong message and strong story. Unfortunately it is full of clichés. Plus I think that with the star power at hand (no pun intended), mainly Matthew McConnaughey who finally has all the reasons he needs to be shirtless and Channing Tatum, the real revelation of this movie goes almost unnoticed.Alex Pettyfer is the man I'm talking about! I have criticized him for a lot of his prior roles (be it ""Number 4"" or the really bad ""Beastly""), but he finally gets to shine here. His character is also the most interesting one besides Channing Tatums, who plays the main role of course.Another great thing is, that it's not an all out male cast. And you also get some female nudity to counter balance all those half naked guys! And the best way to watch this of course: With a bunch of women in a cinema! Their reactions are priceless (even the hating when it comes to women getting naked in this movie)!",Magic Mike
3,jboothmillard,Magic Mike,5,24 February 2013,"From director Steven Soderbergh (Sex, Lies, and Videotape; Erin Brockovich, Traffic, Ocean's Eleven), I heard about this film a little during the cinema release, and a lot more when released on DVD, I assumed it was going to be something similar to Showgirls, but with male strippers, in a way it was, but obviously turning out well. Basically Mike Lane (Channing Tatum) has plans to have his own business and make good money from using recycled items and turning them into modern and stylish furniture, but he is having trouble doing this, and to pay his bills does a few odd jobs, the most notable being that he performs as a male stripper, nicknamed Magic Mike, for the Xquisite Strip Club, owned by Dallas (Matthew McConaughey), who dreams of making a strip club ""empire"". Nineteen year old Adam (Eragon's Alex Pettyfer), later nicknamed 'The Kid', was recently fired from his construction job, and meeting Mike he enters the male stripper world under his wing to learn the tricks of the trade to becoming a stripper himself, and Mike gets to know Adam's sister Brooke (Cody Horn), he promises to look after her brother, and they get close despite him having an on-off relationship with Joanna (Olivia Munn). Adam gets the hang of the stripper game, but he also falls into the darker side of the business, indulging in nights of drugs, alcohol and many sexual encounters with clients, and Mike meanwhile is tiring of the lifestyle and wanting to make it in his custom furniture venture, but he is needed when the Xquisite dancers are to move the act to Miami, Mike is forced to remain when the bank denies him a loan. At Dallas's house Adam gets involved with a scheme created by Xquisite's DJ Tobias (Gabriel Iglesias) to drug clients of the club and elsewhere with ecstasy, and he himself starts using the drug, his mentor has been noticing him acting recklessly, he tries to help by telling him about the promise he made to Brooke. Some days pass, and in a sorority house the strippers perform a private show, and the young man brings along a package of drugs, giving one to the a young woman, this creates a fight between him and her boyfriend, to which Mike and him run away, getting away they are angry at both not being paid for the show, and for leaving behind the drugs worth $10,000. The next night after a show finishes Mike and Adam take some drugs together and go clubbing, the young man is found by Brooke on the floor, following vomiting and passing out, she is angry with Mike and ends the relationship with him, and he meanwhile has to pay the drug suppliers $10,000, Adam's debt, which Brooke doesn't know about. Mike realises that Dallas is driven by greed and does not really pay attention to the welfare of his performers, so he finally decides enough is enough by pretending to go to the restroom and going for the back exit and driving away to Brooke's apartment to tell her he is through with the being a stripper. Dallas finds out that Magic Mike will not be returning, so he invites Adam to take his place as the front man of the dancers in the shows, he meanwhile had told Brooke that the £10,000 debt he owed was paid off by Mike, so they forgive each other and start their relationship again. Also starring Matt Bomer as Ken, Riley Keough as Nora, Joe Manganiello as Big Dick Richie, The Punisher's Kevin Nash as Tarzan and Adam Rodriguez as Tito. Tatum is likable as the stripper trying to get away from the sleaziness, Pettyfer does well as the young newcomer getting mixed up with the wrong crowd, and McConaughey is a fantastic choice as the money hungry git who runs the show, it is kind of similar to a Showgirls plot, only without too much prostitution and rubbish material, and I can see a connection with the feel of Boogie Nights, it is an interesting story with some entertaining performances on the dance floor, in terms of choreography, it is more a woman's film, it works if you're gay as well, I was watching it purely because everyone else was, not much in the way of a story happens, but there are funny bits, and it is a likable enough comedy drama. Worth watching!",Magic Mike
4,blanche-2,rented this and thought it would be fun,5,4 May 2015,"Alas, ""Magic Mike"" wasn't fun at all. Clocking in at 110 minutes, it felt like Battleship Potemkin with none of the historical value.I really wanted to see Matt Bomer; after this film, I'm not sure I ever want to see him again. He didn't seem to have much to do. None of the characters were really fleshed out, except maybe the McConaughey character.Some of the scenes seemed improvisational, only because I can't imagine anyone would write wretched dialogue like that and try to pass it off in a script.The story seemed to have no direction -- I don't mean that it was badly directed. It was, but I mean the script didn't seem to be going anywhere. Also, I guess we were supposed to believe these guys were all straight. I don't think that's normally the circumstance.Some of the stage performances were okay. I especially liked Mike doing the the backflips.Did I mention the acting? Bad, except for McConaughey. It wasn't much of a stretch for him.It's amazing to me what gets made nowadays.",Magic Mike
5,Quinoa1984,"a fun movie, with a boost from McConaughey",7,12 July 2015,"Channing Tatum shouldn't work as a dramatic actor in movies, and he usually doesn't (re The Son of No One for more of that). He also shouldn't work with anyone but Steven Soderbergh since he seems to know how to use him (comedies like the Jump Street flicks are another matter, where he shines). Hell, even Alex Pettyfer, who I've heard is occasionally stuff in other roles, does alright in a (admittedly) simplistic role.But the real star for me is Matthew McConaughey. Between this, Bernie, and Killer Joe, he's suddenly not just a good actor, he's a *fantastic* actor if one sees 2012. He needs flashy, over-the-top and rather sinister roles like this one. Less impressive (MUCH less so) is Warner brothers' CEO daughter Cody Horn as the blank-as-a-chalkboard-in-an-attic love interest. Also, the ending is, without another better word for it, stupid.For what it's worth or expected, Magic Mike is much more entertaining, better and simply fun than it has any right to be, and is refreshing to see a film that is about a world that we really don't get to ever see much of in Hollywood films. This despite some of the worst sound editing/recording I've heard in a major motion picture (is it cause of the Red Epic? Please tell me it's so), and the one performance I mentioned. Familiarity is somewhat of an issue but is downplayed by the natural attitude of the acting and dialogue, and Soderbergh's attention to attention and style; for him this must've been like assigning himself ala the old Hollywood system a Dance picture. One man's Top Hat is another's 'Male Entertainer' dramedy.",Magic Mike
6,tavm,Steven Soderbergh's Magic Mike was quite a nice change of pace from what I usually watch in theatres,8,12 July 2012,"While I'm proud of the fact that director Steven Soderbergh grew up in my current hometown of Baton Rouge, La., I don't consider myself enough of a fan of his to seek out all his movies since many of them tend to meander a bit before leading to something worthy of whatever conclusions end up wherever. Still, while that was what I experienced while watching Magic Mike, I did like where it led to when the movie ended when it did. I mean, there are quite a few funny places that I liked and some dramatic arcs that made sense to whatever characterizations were being offered. And Channing Tatum, who's also a producer here, is enough of a presence here to carry the whole thing having previously enjoyed what he did in The Vow and Dear John. Matthew McConaughey also got some chuckles from me. Really, all I'll say now is Magic Mike is well worth a look. P.S. The person who played Tarzan is Kevin Nash who my WWE fan friend noticed immediately as he also previously did when we were watching Rock of Ages where he played the bodyguard of Tom Cruise's Stacie Jaxx character.",Magic Mike
7,edwagreen,Nothing Magical About Magic Mike *,2,11 June 2013,"Just a small grade above awful describes this vulgar 2012 film.Every third word in the movie begins that famous profanity starting with the sixth letter of the alphabet. It is most disgusting, degrading piece of writing I've witnessed in quite a while.Matthew McConaughey bares it all in this dreadful film. It's basically how one guy drags another to become a male stripper. That scene where he does his first strip reminded me so much of Natalie Wood, as Gypsy Rose Lee on stage the first time in the Rosalind Russell film ""Gypsy."" Of course, you couldn't compare that film since it dealt with family over trash such as this one.There is irony at the end when the guy who got him involved gets uninvolved and his friend is part of the stripping scene.",Magic Mike
8,preppy-3,Aside from the stripping there's nothing new here but I was never bored,7,30 June 2012,"This takes place in Florida. A 30 year old male stripper Magic Mike (Channing Tatum) meets young Adam (Alex Pettyfer) who has no direction in life. Mike takes him under his wing and gets him to be a stripper. He also romances Adams' sister Brooke (Cody Horn). But Adam gets hooked on drugs and things get dangerous.First let's get the nude issue out of the way. There is only one full frontal in the movie--it's off to the side, is partially blocked and is probably faked. It's also very funny. There's mostly butt shots only but all are from Tatum, Pettyfer and Adam Rodriguez. This movie is NOT about the nudity. The movie moves slow (although I was never bored) and main events happen off screen OR are never explained! Still the movie works. For one thing all the acting is good. I was surprised at how good Tatum was. I never thought he could act till this. He captures his character perfectly. Pettyfer was equally good as Adam. Even Matthew McConaughey was good as the group's owner named Dallas. The strip acts themselves are incredible. All the guys are in good shape and Tatum shows some moves that are jaw-dropping! However they're not shot in an exploitive fashion. They're done in a matter of fact way that actually makes them seem quite funny. This movie (script wise) shows us nothing new but it was well-made and entertaining. This is not just for women and gay men--I think everyone would enjoy it. I give it a 7.",Magic Mike
9,Boba_Fett1138,Not a perfect movie but it will surely change a lot.,7,22 July 2012,"It's always good to see something fresh and new. This movie turns tables around and turns men into sexual objects, the same way women have been portrayed for years, in many different type of movies. And I truly applaud this approach, since it finally gives women something tasty to look at (goes for some men as well of course) and something to lust over. After all, women are only human as well, it appears.It really was inferable a movie like this would be made one day. But it's surprising to see it's being a pretty decent movie to watch as well. Yes, even for straight males. It's also somewhat surprising to see how popular and what a box office hit this movie was. This was probably only mean more movies like this, catered toward women, will be made, or at least more movies with some male nudity in it. It probably will start to become more acceptable and in some ways also starts being a must to bring in a large crowed, also for big mainstream movies. in that regard ""Magic Mike"" might turn out to be a revolutionary movie but for now, it simple remains a pretty good and fun little movie to watch.And it really is a fun, little, harmless movie. Serously, I can't anyone being offended with this movie its theme or amount of nudity. The striptease moments really get really well incorporated into the movie and are not just there to shock or to make women gush. it's obviously being a big part of the story and everything got quite tastefully done. Even the straight males shall be able to appreciate the choreography and all of the skills and effort that went and to it and the whole way it got brought to the screen, by Steven Soderbergh.Steven Soderbergh's approach was probably the reason why this movie was an above average one to watch. He often manages to put a certain realism in his movies, mostly with the way he lets his actors work. That works well for this movie and makes it a mostly pleasant watch.I still have plenty of problems with it though. In essence its being a very simplistic movie, with a simple story in it, that isn't necessarily always going anywhere. At least not anywhere interesting. Another thing is that the movie mostly seems to be focusing on two different characters, which each their own thing going on. I feel that in this particular case it would had been better for the movie to focus on just one main character and have one main story going on in it.It's definitely true that Channing Tatum's gets better and better, with every movie he appears in. He simply was perfectly cast in his role (after all, the movie is also loosely based on his early pre-Hollywood life and career) and this movie also was the one Matthew McConaughey had been waiting for all his career! Finally he has a good excuse to take his shirt off in a movie.All in all, it's being far from a perfect film but most women will most likely hardly care about that. It's still being a good enough movie in itself as well, for basically just about everybody to enjoy!7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Magic Mike
10,neil-476,Welcome to the hen house,7,13 July 2012,"Mike (Channing Tatum), 30-ish, has a number of irons in the fire. He does construction work, he has one or two other business activities (which may or may not exist) and he has ambitions to start a business creating bespoke furniture. Oh, and he is a member of a Chippendales-style male stripper troupe. This latter activity, in particular, enables him to save large cash sums as well as to enjoy a carefree lifestyle involving as much promiscuous sex as he wants. Then he encounters Adam (Alex Pettyfer) and brings him into his stripping circle: he also encounters Adam's older sister Brooke (Cody Horn) and begins to understand that she may have something more to offer him than simple immediate gratification.Let me say that the film always engaged me. The plot did ramble somewhat, but the characters were well drawn and there was reasonable character development. The film was often amusing, especially in the early part, the dance routines had some impressive elements, and the cast were mostly good. Less pleasingly, there were times when dialogue was difficult to make out, some plot threads were started and then left to dangle, and there was a phenomenal amount of bad language (I've said it before but it bears repeating - the F-bomb can be very effective but, if used without any regard for purpose, it can detract. That is the case here). However, the performances of Tatum, newcomer Horn, and Matthew McConaughey (as strutting troupe leader, Dallas, a part to which he is supremely suited), are all so pleasing that they make up for any shortcomings.The trailer for Magic Mike made it look to be a light drama with some humour, punctuated with some dance sequences. On the basis that it looked as if it would be quite interesting (and also that it was the only new film on release this week), I went to see it. As a bloke in late middle age, I was immediately pleased by the delightful Miss Olivia Munn displaying her equally delightful boobs (though less pleased by Mr Tatum's bare buttocks in the same scene: however, fair play for all, says I).But I think I may have misread the appeal of the trailer. For, sitting in a cinema full of young (and not so young) and, it must be admitted, raucous women, I felt as out of place as a pig at a bar mitzvah. I think I must have been the only viewer who wasn't there for the abs and buns and, it must be admitted, abs and buns abound in this movie. I must confess to being impressed by how good a mover Channing Tatum is - both artistically and gymnastically - and the routines were well choreographed in general, usually with a lot of humour. They didn't do a lot for me otherwise, but there was a lot of cackling from the rest of the audience (often at times when I went ""Huh? What on earth was funny about that?"" Yet it plainly struck a chord with a large section of the audience).Guys, don't see this with an audience full of women, it's a horrible experience. I've never felt so intimidated.",Magic Mike
11,evanston_dad,Not a Lot of Magic in Mike,7,27 December 2012,"A shoulder shrug of a movie from Steven Soderbergh, which I enjoyed enough while watching it but which left me wondering why so many people thought it was an interesting enough idea to get made in the first place.Though I take that back -- it IS an interesting idea, because how many movies are there about the male side of the sex industry? The only other one that comes to mind is ""Boogie Nights,"" and indeed ""Magic Mike"" plays like a lite version of that film. However, ""Boogie Nights"" had a more panoramic view of the adult entertainment world, while ""Magic Mike"" focuses on a couple of not very interesting guys working in a small-time strip club, as opposed to the full-blown porn world of the other film. It's hard to care about Mike (played by Channing Tatum), a golden-boy stripper, and the young man he takes under his wing (Alex Pettyfer) who turns into a bit of a Frankenstein's monster. For me this was largely due to the fact that I simply don't find Tatum to be very charismatic, something his character is supposed to be in spades in order for him to work as written by Soderbergh. And he's really the only person we spend much time with after the movie's mid-point, when it has pretty much disposed of Pettyfer. There are other guys who work at the club, including Matthew McConaughey in an ick performance, but we don't learn anything about them. The movie might have been more interesting if we had.As it is, the movie is beached in that no-man's-land of movie-goer indifference. Not campy enough to enjoy as a guilty pleasure, not meaty enough to enjoy as a satisfying drama. It's easy to sit through and just as easily forgotten.Grade: B",Magic Mike
12,anaconda-40658,Magic Channing.,7,13 July 2015,"Magic Mike (2012): Dir: Steven Soderbergh / Cast: Channing Tatum, Alex Pettyfer, Cody Horn, Matthew McConaughey, Olivia Munn: Being one of only four males in a theatre populated with females did not prevent me from enjoying this showcase about ability. Channing Tatum plays Magic Mike, a male stripper who works on roofing projects during the day, while also working towards his own business regarding custom made furniture. Alex Pettyfer plays a new employee at the roofing project whom Mike takes into the club when he quits the day job. When one act is unable to perform, Pettyfer is thrust out to the cheers and delights of women desperate to tuck cash in his boxers. This can be repetitious with a romantic subplot that is all too predictable but the concept works and the ending allows two parties to pursue what they are truly after. Females will enjoy this film more than males although it is a far cry from Striptease. Tatum once again proves a strong lead as he desires to retire what has made him wealthy so that he may achieve a more honorable career. Pettyfer plays a thief who lives with his sister and gets caught up on drugs with the notion that stripping will pay for it. Cody Horn as his sister is slighted with the cardboard romantic subplot. There is vague references to a job but that is merely a mention. Matthew McConaughey steals scenes as the club organizer who opens the show. Olivia Munn is underused as Mike's on and off girlfriend who could have use a few more scenes. With flashy dance acts that materialize the downfall of the business, the magic eventually fades to reality. Score: 7 ½ / 10",Magic Mike
13,gradyharp,'You are the husband they never had! You are that dreamboat guy that never came along!',5,25 October 2012,"'Girls, they want to have fun!' - and if that was the raison d'être for bringing this shallow film to the public it certainly paid off - the 'Magic' was in the box office cash registers. When the film plays on a DVD or Video on demand and is reduced to a small screen, then the fact that this is a very minor work becomes very apparent. One wonders why Stephen Soderbergh who brought us such fine films as Traffic, Erin Brockovich, Che, Kafka, King of the Hill and the Ocean's 11, 12 and 13 bothered with this. The script is by Reid Carolin who opted for more dance sequences and partying than significant storyline. The characters are very one- dimensional and the development of change is at a minimum.Mike (Channing Tatum) is a unique furniture designer who is saving his money to start his own business - the money comes from roofing, detailing cars, and stripping in a girl club and at parties. He takes a younger performer Adam called The Kid (Alex Pettyfer) under his wing and schools him in the arts of partying, picking up women, and making easy money, much to the disgust and frustration of dam's sister Brooke (Cody Horn). Mike brings Adam to meet Dallas (Matthew McConaughey) who hires men with the right bodies and equipment to show it all to the hungry women in the nightclub. His crew includes a group of male strippers - Joe Manganiello, Matt Bomer, Adam Rodriguez, Kevin Nash and others, none of whom has more than a line or two in between the dance numbers. Adam makes money and gets women, Mike gets women and occasionally gets serious (Olivia Munn) but after three months of stripping and partying Adam falls into the drug game with Tobias (Gabriel Iglesias) and that is the beginning of the end. The rest of the film remains predictable.The acting is minimal, the dance numbers are what draws the viewers and if you judge films by the box office then this is a hit. Pretty sad and trivial, but that is not the point. The point, it seems, is to see guys get naked. Grady Harp",Magic Mike
14,zetes,Kind of a bore,6,20 January 2013,"Soderbergh's second film of 2012, and his second dud. Well, this one was a box office hit, anyway, maybe his biggest in a long while. But that's mostly because it features Channing Tatum stripping. That's about all it has to offer, though. The stripping sequences are the only times the film comes alive. The plot otherwise is a total bore. Tatum again proves that he's more than a pretty body. I doubt he'll ever be an Oscar winner, but he's got some talent. Matthew McConaughey had such a winning streak this year, and he gives another fine performance here. I don't think it's his best of the year - that would be Killer Joe - but it's good. Alex Pettyfer, who plays the young stripper whom Tatum brings into the club, is totally bland. Cody Horn, who plays his sister and Tatum's love interest, is quite a looker and seems to be talented. Look out for her in the future. Olivia Munn also co-stars and continues to be a snooze.",Magic Mike
15,mm-39,Magic Mike went through a shock.,5,1 July 2012,"I went to Magic Mike with my wife. I was almost the only guy in the theater. A couple guys there but I think they were as interested in the male eye candy as the women. I think the movie pushed the edges, but could have been worse. The movie is about Magic Mike who never had a real relationship, where he could seriously talk with someone. The life became empty, with the yelling, stupidity, and fake people. Magic Mike had no real friends. The movie was too much about eye candy and missed out on the emptiness Mike had with his life. I wished there was more about Mike's personal demons. I believe the show did not have enough of Matthew's character involved in the story to show a contrast. Matthew's narration is the movie is about sex and money. Intimacy, relationships, and any meaning could not be found in Mike's lifestyle which Matt promoted. Mike was never going to be taken seriously by any women or boss in this film. Mike left before he was going to crash and burn like the others. Be it whatever vice each person was hooked on. I give Mike a 5 out of 10 there is very little magic here!",Magic Mike
16,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Magic Mike,8,11 August 2012,"Fans of Channing Tatum wouldn't miss him much even if the summer blockbuster GI Joe: Retaliation is now undergoing some massive post production 3D, or as rumours have been buzzing about a major re-write and reshoot so as to have Tatum's character play an expanded role than originally intended. After all, his star is beginning to shine, and it would be foolish to write his character off. Thankfully then that Magic Mike did indeed make it to Singapore, and boy will it please his female fans to see a lot more than they would have bargained for, together with a number of hunks in a male revue to tease and titillate.Based loosely on Tatum's own experiences as a male stripper when he was 19, Magic Mike takes us into the world of the men behind their persona and on-stage antics, which naturally comes complete with a full repertoire of phallic motions, pelvic thrusts and almost dry humping for customers who turn up in droves to watch their male fantasies in action. And there's some truth in what the owner of the Xquisite club, Dallas (Matthew McConaughey), says about money being made from these fantasies, as he shows the ropes to rookie Adam (Alex Pettyfer), recruited by Tatum's titular character when they met during one of his many day jobs.And for someone down and out, but willing to do anything it takes to earn a living, this lifestyle may seem like a good option to make that quick buck, parted easily when providing a little cock and tease to legions of screaming fans who want to have a piece of you. The given is to be blessed with good looks, with diligence put into hours of work out sessions to sculpt a body worthy of a god. And then with the right contacts and chance, the doors get opened. This is the tale of two men, one a self-appointed mentor to the other, and how some get led astray because of availability and opportunity.But of course Adam's story comes packaged with the usual pitfalls that come to haunt those looking, and are eager for, quick success. The lifestyle of drugs, women, and money from illicit means rear their ugly head, as if to reinforce stereotypes of those engaged in the business that it comes part and parcel of, and it's extremely difficult to refuse unless one quits the scene totally. There are of course those, personified by Mike, who are in need as a means to get a different end, which in his case is to raise enough capital to get credit for a custom furniture business. Hopes and dreams also extend to relationships one try to establish, especially when they usually develop from something sexual, and are hardly the permanence anyone is looking for. For convenience, Adam's sister Brooke (Cody Horn) becomes the object of mutual attraction for Mike, as he figures out his on-off open relationship with Joanna (Olivia Munn).Steven Soderbergh has crafted what would be one of his most profitable films to date, with production costing about 7 million, but having already raked more than 100 million at the box office. Shot in a style that's almost documentary in nature, the line is never crossed here, with those looking for hard sexual scenes needing to look elsewhere. Most of the time the performers stay very close to the line against indecency, with dry humping and simulated sex being routines of choice. Some portions of the film do turn dry at times, especially when scenes aren't centered at the men, but to develop the budding relationship between Brooke and Mike, and then explode when routines get their screen time. The dramatic scenes serve as fillers for the real feast for the eyes, and the revue sequences were definitely a lot more fun, with various uniformed routines bound to elicit laughter from all sections of the audience, and probably tease the female crowd at the same time as well.Until Channing Tatum returns to street dancing like from his Step Up days, Magic Mike is probably the closest a dance fan can watch him in action, or for his fanbase to catch some of the routines he had probably performed when he had yet to burst onto the Hollywood scene.",Magic Mike
17,Mr-Fusion,Flies off the rails when the script gets serious,5,6 May 2015,"When ""Magic Mike"" is about the actual stripping, it's pretty entertaining; the washboard abs parade, the absurd routines, the impressive dancing (Tatum, all on his own). It's actually kinda fun watching McConaughey own an audience full of horny women. But it becomes scatterbrained with an underdeveloped relationship (Cody Horn, the cast's dead weight), a wayward protégé, Tatum's pipe dream future, a sudden drug subplot; this thing's all over the map. Alex Pettyfer's the reason we even venture into this world in the first place, and as soon as he's dabbling in drugs, he's relegated to set dressing. Can't believe I'm saying this, but it's dull when the guys are clothed.5/10",Magic Mike
18,siderite,A low key movie about getting a life,8,10 May 2015,"I really dug this film. Imagine a kind of low volume Trainspotting, with less of a shitty life, less of a drug problem, less psychotic friends, but also more real, closer to what real life is, making more of a point, albeit a subtle one.Follow the life of Magic Mike, a 30 year old stripper who's dream is to build stuff with his hands and thinks he is doing the stripping just to get the money to get him started. He meets 19 year old Adam, lost, not knowing what to do with himself, and introduces him into stripping: horny women, money, drugs. This leads to revelations about his own purpose in life.On this background, there is some male stripping, some Olivia Munn, also some romance. Matthew McConaughey of course does a great job portraying the old patron of the stripping club - you know, the crazy mentor thing he loves to do. Olivia Munn is equally lovely and terrifying as the calculating libertarian woman.About Tatum, he does the confident sexy charming thing with so much ease, then goes into the shy emotional awkward phase like it's nothing. I think in this film he shows not only his physical prowess, but his ability as an actor.Bottom line: not everything needs to be superlative to make a good movie. This is an entertaining, but also instructive film, with great performances all around. You should watch it. With a girl, preferably... you can try some of those moves later :)",Magic Mike
19,StevePulaski,"Plagued by a demeaning simplification, but rebounded by impressive style and redeeming substance",8,1 July 2012,"In the world of performing and stripping, you are only as valuable as the cash you bring in your trousers, speedo, or whatever you have around your waste. Going into Magic Mike, you should have this vague idea looming in your head, and not the assumption you're going to be cinematically seduced by Channing Tatum's impeccable charm and looks or Matthew McConaughey's bulging biceps and cowboy uniform. Magic Mike is a film of depth and certainty; one of the more unexpected films to come out of 2012, a year where film has been relatively mixed. A year where I have yet to give a film a perfect rating.It is common, and I suppose fair, as well, to ostracize Magic Mike as a ""male stripper movie,"" and one that will only appeal to women seeking out more of the lovable hunk Tatum. Part of this is true, but this is one of those films that is unfairly labeled by a cruel and falsifying simplification. In the film world, marketing is everything, and Magic Mike has been cheated out of showing what it is really about; humanity and substance.We are greeted with the nineteen year old troublemaker, nicknamed ""The Kid,"" (Alex Pettyfer) who lost his football scholarship after a fight with the coach, begins living with his sister, Brooke (Cody Horn), and gets fired on the first day of his new construction job under the suspicion of thievery. He is given a ride by the title character (Tatum) after his car refuses to start, and the two men go clubbing, where they meet two local girls, one who just turned twenty-one. This is where Mike reveals to them, and ""The Kid"" (Adam) for that matter, that he is a male stripper, working several nights a week at a club called ""Xquisite."" Mike takes ""The Kid"" down to the club, where he is acquainted with all the dancers, including the boss, Dallas (McConaughey). After Mike and Dallas force ""The Kid"" on stage, they discover his dancing isn't half bad and he is welcomed to perform with the other dancers on certain nights. We are then taken on a roller-coaster ride of emotions, integrity, and bad choices throughout the rest of the film, and discover that these men are not basic caricatures but facts of life.Steven Soderbergh, one of the most prolific directors today, next to Woody Allen, lets the story build on its own and never overcompensates in a way that becomes too intuitive, gimmicky, or self-serving. He directs the picture sensitively and expertly, letting the choreography and the athleticism of the dance sequences be shown with full shots, and not the simple close-ups of characters. He shows the stage as a whole, the complexity of their routines, and the vast appreciation and acclaim from their female audience members. The rest of the picture is directed with a pleasant warmness, with a somewhat muted but sufficient color-pallet, making this one of the most artistic mainstream efforts of the year.When Mike and Brooke begin to form a relationship, we continue to see Mike as a full character for the remainder of the picture. He is an aspiring entrepreneur, making unique furniture out of junkyard parts, and while he's passionate about it, he recognizes that bread needs to be put on the table, and that stripping, at this point in time, seems like a valid option.It's no secret that the role of ""Magic Mike"" was written especially for Tatum, as he worked as a male stripper for a while during his adolescence, and the film is loosely centered on his experiences. He gives one of the most capable performances of the summer, and becomes invigorating to watch both on and off the stage. A huge rebound after the mediocre film The Vow But what really gives the film the high-octane energy it needs is when Soderbergh gives the characters on-stage and off-stage personalities, and never becomes too inclined to showcase frivolous romanticism between Mike and Brooke. It gives character traits to Magic Mike and Mike Lane, who are two very different people.It's depressing to believe that more than half of the revenue of Magic Mike's strong opening weekend is from women, when the film is satisfying for both genders equally. The women become entranced with Tatum's looks and the affectionate masculinity and bleeding testosterone, while the men become intrigued at the business aspect of the film. One thing the public can't look past is vague stereotypes when it comes to films, and neglect to consider their depth and power as a whole. Sort of how Brokeback Mountain is routinely simplified as a ""gay cowboy movie"" and Shame, the ""sex addiction movie."" This goes for the public as a broad whole, both male and female; the film does more than showcase the movement and dancing talents of relatively young men, but offers brave insight in the world of performing and stripping. Try and find those characteristics in Coyote Ugly or Showgirls.NOTE: To add on to my statement about Coyote Ugly and Showgirls, it is interesting to note that both films were directed by males and did a meandering job of showcasing life on the stage and off, but Magic Mike is taken in the hands of a male director and screenwriter and does everything impressively. I'm waiting for a film about female strippers that is taken in the hands of a female director and screenwriter. Perhaps then we will get some faithful, satisfying commentary that goes beyond the easy trap of exploitation and misogyny.Starring: Channing Tatum, Alex Pettyfr, Cody Horn, and Matthew McConaughey. Directed by: Steven Soderbergh.",Magic Mike
20,DKosty123,Audience for This Is ?,3,1 January 2013,"To me this movie is an insult to adult women. It appears to be aimed at women who have never made love to a man. It plays on the stereotype that a bigger dumb stick is better. That is a message the media is trying to get young women to buy. If they buy this message they are fools.As for me, Matthew McConaughey does seem to have a semi-screen presence at Magic Mike running a male strip club. There is some nice skin scenes for the R Rated viewer. Plot is basic trying to open a big new club on Miami Beach as Magic Mike's goal.Romance and sex and pretty much tied together in this movie with a few inferences to illegal drugs helping the process. These values are all tired and been done before. I found little to laugh about in this unless you get a kick out of poor acting and dialog.My main points are for the staging of the dance numbers. There are some clever stage stuff with dancing and music going on. The love story is pretty dull as it does not belong with a bunch of people who are doing what they are doing for the money. Love is defined differently in this type of party atmosphere.Women who are naive and still dreaming about what they want might get something out of this movie as the fantasy is aimed mostly at them. As for the rest of us, if we like costumes, music, and cleverly staged dancing, that is all I get out of this along with seeing skin.",Magic Mike
21,lasttimeisaw,Magic Mike,7,6 August 2012,"Soderbergh's down-spiraling career (after winning a BEST DIRECTOR Oscar award for TRAFFIC 2000) has been bumpy and contentious which may also hurdle the decision of giving Oscar to young talents since the post-Oscar symptom does have a much conspicuous effect on youngsters. Here's my encapsulated list of Soderbergh's films I'm been watched, OCEAN'S THIRTEEN (2007, 6/10), THE GOOD German (2006, 5/10), BUBBLE (2005, 7/10); OCEAN'S TWELVE (2004, 6/10), SOLARIS (2002, 4/10), OCEAN'S ELEVEN (2001, 7/10), ERIN BROCKOVICH (2000, 8/10), TRAFFIC (8/10) and SEX, LIES, AND VIEDEOTAPE (1989, 7/10). So clearly I have avoided his works for five years, if it is for the sake of its out-of-expectation box-office performance and male-stripper source, the gap would be longer. The film is not Soderbergh's best, since the story entwines with a script full of banality, but nevertheless it is a successful touchstone on the bank-ability of naked beefcake, which has countered the over-ploughed female sex appeal. Female audience has gratifying embraced it with a vengeance, the inversion of exploitation (thanks to an extra pushing from the budding gay audience) has become another profitable golden mine for the behind-the-curtain Hollywood tycoons. Speaking of the film itself, it is magnificently pleasant to watch, while everyone on screen has a gorgeous physique (save the screenwriter Reid Carolin maybe, who has a cameo role as the ex- BF) and Channing (Magic Mike) is a true show-stopper (whose heyday comes earlier this year), his stripper antics are just dashing but unsurprising (if one familiars with her breakthrough turn in STEP UP, 2006, a 5/10). Pettyfer is a rookie which should reflect Channing's own experience, and he is a pretty-face with a lean-but-beefy body, but the film has to diverge from his story and put a decent amount of screen time about Magic Mike, so maybe we will see more of him in its sequel.The strongest arm from the cast actually should be Matthew McConaughey (sorry Bomer, your role is really under-excavated), who is the only award-worthy candidate (a golden globe nomination maybe, but he has another two more daunting films will come this year, MUD and THE PAPERBOY, so a final Oscar nomination might not be a pipe dream). Personally I think we should pat on the back of Cody Horn, whose naturalistic acting has a charming chemistry with Mr. Tanning.",Magic Mike
22,KineticSeoul,The ups and downs of the lifestyle of being a male stripper,5,28 August 2012,"So this movie is basically about male strippers. But doesn't only revolve around the stripper life but what happens behind the scene as well and when out of work. But most of the focus is on Mike aka Magic Mike(Channing Tatum) having a new guy Adam(Alex Pettyfer) under his wings like a older brother while showing him the life in the male stripper business. And you also get Adam's sister thrown into the mix. Now most people that seen some movies that feature Channing Tatum knows that he is a pretty good dancer. And he is the best dancer in this movie and he mixes up male stripper dancing with a bit of Hip Hop dancing. Although this movie might be disturbing for some straight guys but some parts can be humorous for some as well. There was few women behind me and they were cracking up and making noise when the male strippers started performing. Matthew McConaughey is in this as Dallas as the owner of the male strip club who also performs as well. And he is the crazy obnoxious male stripper in this movie. Most of the scenes shows the relationship between Mike and Adam, and Mike and Adam's sister. The story isn't anything amazing just a guy stripper mentoring another male stripper while dealing with his own personal problems. What it did a good job though is how it showed how although male strippers may seem like they have money and freedom but it comes with the negatives as well. It did seem to show the male stripper lifestyle in the most entertaining way possible. It's not a bad movie but for guys their really isn't much, it felt sort of like one of those ""Step Up"" movies with a slightly better story and male strip dancing.5/10",Magic Mike
23,Hellmant,Channing Tatum actually carries the film with charisma and some amazing dance moves!,8,3 July 2012,"'MAGIC MIKE': Four Stars (Out of Five) Steven Soderbergh continues to show his amazing versatility by directing this male stripper comedy drama film based on the actual experiences of star Channing Tatum (Tatum was a 19 year old stripper in Tampa, Florida). In the film actor Alex Pettyfer plays the rookie stripper and Tatum plays his mentor. The movie also stars Matthew McConaughey as an aging stripper who owns and manages the club these male strippers work at. The film was written by Reid Carolin. The movie has a surprising amount of emotional depth and is very involving, it's nothing like the 'chick flick' romantic comedy the trailers made it out to be! Tatum stars as Mike Lane, the lead dancer/stripper at Xquisite, which is owned and ran by Dallas (McConaughey), a very serious businessman. Pettyfer co-stars as Adam, a 19 year old former high school football star who just moved to Florida to live with his sister Brooke (Cody Horn), after losing his college football scholarship due to a fight with the coach. Adam meets Mike on a construction job, which he quits due to the boss accusing him of stealing soda. He later meets Mike at a club and learns he's a stripper. Mike then gives him a job helping him and other strippers at the Xquisite that night. After one stripper overdoses and can't perform Adam is put on in his place and does so well he secures himself a regular job there. Mike then continues to introduce him to his party lifestyle of lots of drugs, alcohol and sex. This doesn't sit well with Adam's sister and Mike begins to develop feelings for her. Mike also doesn't plan on staying a stripper for much longer as he dreams of starting his own company in custom furniture.With almost $40 million in the first weekend this definitely marks Tatum as a bona fide movie star! Until now he's kind of been a rising star and it wasn't clear how much draw and popularity he actually carried. This film definitely launches him to the top of the A list and in roles like this he's actually a pretty good actor (I also thought he was impressive in 'FIGHTING' and '21 JUMP STREET'). He's about five times as good in this as he was in 'THE VOW' and he actually carries the film with charisma and some amazing dance moves. Even actors like Pettyfer look good here though due to the amazing directing of Steven Soderbergh. There's a saying that there's no bad actors just bad directors but I think the saying should actually be there's no good actors just good directors. Soderbergh, plus an amazing script, really make this movie something to remember (plus Tatum's performance). I'm continually baffled by Soderbergh's choices in film as of late but he always makes each project work and I'd even say this is one of his best films. It's got the feel of the type of classic 80's film that made Tom Cruise a superstar. Maybe it'll do the same thing for Tatum.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2vhN3UBteY",Magic Mike
24,thesar-2,For Ladies Only?,3,21 January 2013,"The problem with these full monty-type films is that they never show just that. (Well, they do here, for a brief couple of seconds, off to the left, but then, it was probably fake.)And what is the deal with Steven Soderbergh? Whenever anyone ever asked me who my favorite director over the past couple of years, I would've had said Soderbergh because I really liked Sex, Lies and Videotape, Traffic, the Ocean's series, Erin Brockovich and Out of Sight. But, as of late, damn, he's made some stinking films: Contagion, The Informant!, Haywire and this one: Magic Mike.Okay, in all fairness, both The Informant! and Magic Mike weren't exactly terrible, but going from the excellent films mentioned to these turds is taking him off my top director list.What worked with Magic Mike was the music, the dance segments and Channing Tatum's performance and quick wit. Sadly, with such an incredible running time of 110 minutes for this maaaybe 83 minute story, you only get those positives for roughly 15% of the entire film. The remaining 85% is sometimes painful to get through.In one of the oldest story lines known to humans, an established group of performers encounter a newbie who's wet behind the ears, learns, gets catty and eventually leads, à la All About Eve. This is no spoiler for anyone that has seen a movie and watches the first 5 minutes of this. Of course, that and the obvious ""romance"" are both seen almost immediately.Granted, the ""twist"" is that they're focusing on male strippers, damn good ones, at that and I kinda liked that aspect – no, not just for the nudity and using males over females; I did like the minute update to that part of the old fable.What I didn't like is probably too long of a list to compile. Let's start with the obvious: Cody Horn's, who plays Brooke, the sister of said newbie, acting is so atrocious, so abysmal that if she took acting lessons from Kristen Stewart, it would be a step up. (Hey! I finally gave a compliment to Kristen, albeit inadvertently and backhanded.)Also the editing, off the dance stage, was all over the place. Scenes simply did not make sense, such as lead dancer Mike (Tatum) is getting unreturned phone calls and is looking all over for his rookie ""BFF"" in one scene, and the next, the newbie simply shows up to meet Mike at a bar.I guess people wanted to see this for the nudity and male dancers only, but let me assure you: YouTube has more scenes of that content than this entire mess of a movie. Of the 110 minutes, probably only 15% is of what people, ah-hem, came for.And why is this marketed towards women, only? Can't some men appreciate these fine looking men? Hell, even in the movie, the only single reference to homosexuals even existing is to make fun of them by having the newbie massage a male dancer's leg as an initiation.About 10½ years ago, I was the ""Gentleman of Honor"" at my best friend's wedding, which means not only did I stand on the Bride's side – in a tux, thank you – but I had the duty of the Bachelorette Party. I knew nothing of what goes on in one, but I assumed one stop was a male strip venue.I remember standing in line for a regular, no-name bar who was hosting one that night and the ladies in tow behind me. When it was my turn, the bouncer would not let me in. I explained my role and that I didn't even care to see the show, at any rate. (That was true; the guys that perform are generally not my type.) The door man still declined my entry and handed me a ""GIRLS! GIRLS! GIRLS!"" strip club advertisement card. I looked at him and said: ""What the hell am I supposed to do with this?""He said I would have more fun there and that the guys on stage feel uncomfortable if other guys were in the audience. I ended up at an extremely dead gay bar down the street, being hit on by someone who looks like he ran the amusement park in the Scooby-Doo mysteries and just waited on the girls.That shitty explanation of ""uncomfortableness"" baffles me to this day, nearly 11 years later. #1: They usually don't get completely naked, and even if they did, they look like they work out in a gym, so walking around naked in front of other guys, like in the locker room, should be old school. And #2: If they are straight and are comfortable with their sexuality, it should be just the same as women performing in front of the countless ladies who go to female strip clubs. (Oh, and if they're gay, they it should be even less of a big deal.)I digress. Even without understanding why the men are so uptight in both real life and in this movie, overall, despite it being well shot (cinematography was decent), the few good dance segments and Tatum's unusually fine job, the movie is a waste. Perhaps Magic Mike 2 will be better. And maybe actually show some meat.",Magic Mike
25,Robert_duder,A movie lover/male perspective...,2,18 October 2012,"I am so sick and tired of hearing men bash this movie. I couldn't care less about the quantity of male strippers, even if there was a plethora of male nudity (which there was not.) There was probably an equal amount of scantily clad/naked women in the movie. I'm not a prude, nor do I have some sort of issue with seeing men with their shirts off. Women are barraged with naked/half naked/sexed up female roles 99.9% of the time so I say...have your movie. And I actually looked forward to seeing it, to find out if the film makers actually made a movie geared towards adult women that was worthy of all the constant hype. Nope. In fact, I would be upset or insulted if I were one of the women in the demographic that this film was aimed at. The acting was terrible, the story was downright AWFUL, the script was deplorable and the dance scenes were poor and there were hardly any of them. This felt slapped together to make a buck off an untapped market and they certainly accomplished that. My opinion of this movie is based solely off someone who watches HUNDREDS of movies a year...anything and everything from mainstream, to festival, to animated, to foreign to this. The movie was simply bad.Channing Tatum is everywhere and for the longest time I couldn't stand him but then lately he was starting to grow on me. I even almost enjoyed 21 Jump Street (I can't stand Jonah Hill.) But Tatum's performance in this was equivalent to watching a piece of rock act. He sure is built and thank goodness because his character was garbage and the performance he put into it was pointless. He knew his end goal was to take his shirt off and he just barely acted in the scenes between that. Matthew McConaughey basically plays what I think is some fun drunken version of himself. Instead of being the leader of his pack, he comes across as slimy and annoying and this really is an insult to a man who I know is actually a talented actor. Alex Pettyfer might be the only redeeming performer in the film. He actually tries to give a half decent performance but the script is so bad that he is only as good as his character which is basic, untapped and ignored. Any potential he could have is lost in a wash of a script. I hate to say Cody Horn is a terrible actress because like Pettyfer her character is just awful and gives her so little to deal with. The chemistry with Tatum is lacking and the so called romance angle is completely pointless and by the half hour mark you won't care. Olivia Munn shows up once or twice but is also a pointless vapid character. The rest of the supporting cast is not even worth mentioning.The ironic thing about the film is that it actually has director Steven Soderbergh's mark all over it. He tries to force his gritty, drug riddled, washed out world onto one of the poorest scripts I've ever seen. Soderbergh is completely hit and miss for me but he has been a talented and respected director for a long time. This was a bizarre turn for him and I'd love to know why he chose to do it. In a completely non-shocking turn of events, this is screenwriter Reid Carolin's first film and it should be his last. The common complaint from a lot of people is that the story was just bad and it is. I don't think they even tried to make the film entertaining. Instead they put all their money into advertising, pumping the film up to eager women by billing it as the perfect girls night out or something like that and then got guys to remove their clothes...the story mattered ZERO and that is insulting and just made for a terrible movie. 2/10",Magic Mike
26,MOscarbradley,The Full Monty it ain't,7,13 July 2012,"There's one thing ""Magic Mike"" isn't; it's not an American ""The Full Monty"". It may deal with a guy down on his luck who becomes a male stripper but if anything, Steven Soderbergh's new movie is closer to ""Boogie Nights"". It's certainly not in the same class but it's a much darker movie than I had expected. Being Soderbergh in one of his less frivolous moods, this is a consistently intelligent picture even if, in the end, you never feel it really takes you anywhere.It's also let down in part by the limited acting ability of its two male leads Channing Tatum and Alex Pettyfer. Nevertheless, if their acting isn't up to par they remain two hot little movers in or out of their clothes. The real surprise is Matthew McConaughey in what, I guess, would be the Burt Reynolds role. As his looks begin to fade a little he's turning into a fine character actor and I wouldn't be surprised if his performance here earns him an Oscar nomination next year. Predictable then, but certainly not negligible.",Magic Mike

28,lesleyharris30,"Very Slow Comedy, but brings in Great Laughs and Performances,",7,27 June 2015,"Magic Mike is a good movie with a well developed storyline and an impressive cast. It's an enjoyable movie that brings in many laughs, as well as terrific performances from the entire cast, the chemistry between everyone is great, particularly the parts between Channing Tatum and Cody Horn, they both seemed to really enjoy being in each other's company and their scenes were very natural. It's a really slow movie and can admittedly get very boring at times, there are a lot of very lengthy scenes were the characters are literally just talking, while they are well acted and serve as a great method for character development, they can still get very tedious, they could have easily trimmed a lot of scenes and made it a more bearable ninety minute run. The highlight of the movie is definitely Matthew McConaughey, playing a character unlike one he has ever played before, he is very natural and charismatic in the role of Dallas, his scenes certainly had me entertained the most. It may be very slow, but Magic Milke is still an enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good, easy to watch, comedy if you ever see it on television and had some time to kill. A male stripper teaches a newcomer how to handle the lifestyle, while a relationship develops between him and the newcomers sister. Best Performance: Matthew McConaughey",Magic Mike

I didn't think it was that entertaining except for the dancing but clearly that seemed to be it for me!Y'know the music was OK, I only knew a few but most of them I didn't know about. I didn't seem to be getting to the beat of each track that I didn't know of and it was pretty lame to be honest. The storyline wasn't too great like the actors didn't give enough of emotion for their character roles.

31,vincentlynch-moonoi,"No, just no",5,8 June 2013,"Ever notice how there are times that the public just gets fed up with certain celebrities? I'm feeling that way about Justin Beiber nowadays. And I'm also at that point with Matthew McConaughey. The first time I ever really noticed him was in 1996 with ""A Time To Kill"". I thought he seemed like a promising young actor. And every once in a while, another of his films would come along that would impress me...though not often. But lately, in this succession of films which seemed to be designed to make him seem young and virile (hey, you're 43, get over it and get serious), I am at the point where I doubt I'd ever again intentionally go to see one of his films again. We're all getting over you and all the rumors. Time to move on.If another actor in this movie interests you, forget it. Channing Tatum, on whose life the film is based, is a young actor with a lot of potential. He's impressed me a couple of times now...but not here. Channing, this is not acting. This is just walking around and talking.After some television roles, I was looking forward to seeing Adam Rodriguez. But like virtually every other role in the film, his is not at all developed, and thus a waste of time. The one possible exception -- the female lead -- Cody Horn.

32,tomgillespie2002,An engaging and unconventional experience,7,2 February 2015,"Magic Mike opens in a bright but subtly sleazy nightclub, with Matthew McConaughey's (following his dark turn in 2011's Killer Joe and continuing his recent career renaissance) strip-club owner Dallas, dressed in leather and a cowboy hat, stroking his private area and asking the ladies in the audience ""can you touch this? No, no, no, no."" But Magic Mike, loosely based on lead actor Channing Tatum's experiences as a stripper aged 18, shows that the ladies certainly can touch it, giving us a fascinating and slightly intoxicating insight into a male fantasy life, warts and all, and the lack of substance that comes with it.Dallas's main attraction at his Xquisite Strip Club is 'Magic' Mike Lane (Tatum), who when he is not packing the club with screaming ladies, has threesome's with his kind-of girlfriend Joanna (Olivia Munn) and takes construction work to help fund his entrepreneurial aspirations. He meets college drop-out Adam (Alex Pettyfer) and calls in a favour after he helps Adam into a club one night, promising him paid work if he helps backstage while the men perform on it. Mike and Dallas eventually throw him on stage, and the ladies love him. But Adam has his demons, and his sister Brooke (Cody Horn), makes Mike promise to look out for him.Although the film is primarily about Mike, the first third of the film mainly focuses on Adam, giving us a wide-eyed view-point into this seductive world of admiring women, endless parties, and all the uppers you could pray for. Mike seems custom made for this world and he embraces the g-strings, body oil, and all the superficialities that come with the job. But as he witnesses Adam's head-first plunge into self-destruction, he begins to wonder if the benefits of the job outweigh the ultimate cost. Director Steven Soderbergh manages to capture these moments with a sickly sordidness.It also has a brighter side, with Tatum once again bringing a likability to the all-American jock type. It's the first male stripper film since The Full Monty (1997) of any note, and the strip scenes are infused with an energy and a playfulness that is funny without mocking the industry. The dance routines are increasingly ridiculous, one in which has 'Big Dick' Richie (True Blood's Joe Manganiello) end his routine with the unveiling of his not-so-secret weapon, and Tatum busting some genuinely impressive moves. The romance that develops between Mike and Brooke is predictable but sweet, mainly thanks to Horn's performance, and it's about 20 minutes too long, but ultimately Magic Mike is an engaging and sometimes unconventional experience.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Magic Mike

34,Floated2,Career turning performance,7,4 August 2016,"Starring Channing Tatum as Magic Mike Lane, which is once described as the lead draw for Xquisite, a Tampa strip club. He is in his heart a craftsman, as a roofer, a mechanic or his favored past time of making one-of-a-kind found art furniture. Like a lot of young men, he found himself in desperate circumstances once and turned to stripping to make ends meet. Now getting older and relatively successful, he attempts to do the same for 19 year old Adam (Alex Pettyfer), opening Adam up to the world of male stripping and Mike up to Adam's sister and a world of real people.Magic Mike directed by Steven Soderbergh, and produced by Tatum and is described to be based in part on his real life experience as a male stripper, Stephen Soderbergh''s newest venture is a sort of Boogie Nights-lite, an assay into a sordid world drugs without personal connection or responsibility and what it does to the people involved in it.",Magic Mike
35,johnnyboyz,"Well made character drama demanding the attention of those who'll charge out to see it as well as those who, ordinarily, would steer well clear.",8,3 March 2013,"Try not to be fooled by what you might read about it, hear about it or recall how it was sold; veteran American director Steven Soderbergh's film ""Magic Mike"" is about a lot more than what it seems from a perspective of face value. Depicting unemployment; later covering drug addiction and dropping subtle references to the behaviour of the banks in recent years as well as the global financial situation throughout - the film is much, much more than an hour and a half of renowned photogenic male actors removing garments of clothing. Set across one long, hot Florida summer, the film is a taut and engaging character piece about a group of men and their attitudes towards life; women and then one another.The film begins with a playful entrée: the leader, and most charismatic member, of a Florida based all-male stripping troupe stands by himself on stage in a packed club and attempts to gear the all-female audience into an enthusiastic frenzy just prior to their latest show. That man is a certain ""Dallas"", played by Matthew McConaughey, and the women in front of whom he performs the pre-show ritual are probably amateur actors themselves drafted in as extras genuinely in the ruptures of excitement they need to be for the scene to work. Thus, a neat element of cinema vérité is lent to immediate proceedings. But the film cuts away from anything involved in the show to what seems like the following morning, and we're in someone's apartment as they get up and get dressed. This character is the titular ""Magic"" Mike (Tatum), a well-built individual in his late twenties who has played host to two women overnight but has gone far enough to forget one of their names.The man oozes a sort of brash masculinity on top of this apparent attitude towards the opposite sex; a construction site worker with a large car that's cross-pollinated between a truck and a jeep, he berates the fresh blood who're there for their first day on account of wearing wimpy looking trainers. This fresh blood is Adam, played by English actor Alex Pettyfer; a young man aged nineteen who gets paired with Mike on day one before eventually coming to form a bond with him. Adam lives with his older sister, but struggles with finding work and earning money; indeed, it is Mike who discovers Adam lied during his application regarding certain construction skills he does not possess. At home, he speaks to his sister as to how he would take most jobs – a decent impersonation of Austrian actor-turned-politician Arnold Schwarzenegger sees him even contemplate voice-over acting, in fact things are alluded to as to be so bad that he steals cans of soda from the communal construction site cooler.Fate sees him bump into Mike one evening amidst the many bars and restaurants of this Florida city and its nightlife, a chance meeting which opens his eyes to the fact Mike moonlights as a male stripper and is busy scouring the nightclubs distributing fliers for the show that night. Given his employment status, Adams tags along with Mike to help at the club during the show: menial stuff, such as cleaning up and getting the props ready. Backstage, he meets the half-a-dozen or so other guys in the group and is generally the fall guy to their pranks and windups; indeed, the whole zone is over-cut with this fear factor upon entry as McConaughey towers above our Adam whilst holding a flaming torch on stage as he practises for a routine. Things peak when an injury befalls one of the crew and Adam ends up out there live on stage performing. To his surprise, he enjoys it but he enjoys more the camaraderie with the guys and the money he made.From these beginnings, the film spreads its wings in dipping in and out of both Adam and Mike's lives – perfectly balancing either tale as one man comes to slip deeper into the world of loose women and casual drug use from an initially shy, stoic position and another's gradual realisation that how he's been living perhaps isn't how he wants to be in a number of years' time. Adam's sister, the stone faced Brooke (Horn) and voice of reason in Adam's existence, enters Mike's world and we observe her sensible, empowered and ultimately caring side ease him away from the anonymous, fatuous relationships epitomised by his first scene. The film is a richly rewarding character piece, much more than what one might be willing to merely dismiss it as based on face value and something we can genuinely place with the best of what Soderbergh has produced.",Magic Mike
36,pennyelenabooks,not good enough,2,13 August 2015,"Mike is a male stripper who introduces Adam, a young nineteen year old colleague of his day job, into the world of male stripping. Why did I watched this film again? Probable because the new movie was out and everyone made a big fuss about it. But honestly, with this movie I am wondering why they decided on making a sequel. The whole movie is based on the loath of male bodies. Sure they are making an effort to make it something more, with the drags and everything, but they don't even believe that they could make serious staff. I mean even Mike's dream, making furniture, is so irrelevant, as his ""passion"" is portrayed only in a shot of a table, him examining a chair, and him again trying to get a loan or something at a bank. He seems more into dancing to be honest. Now the drag/living the big life, come later on, as the romance between Mike and Adam's sister slightly moves forward. But even that doesn't give any depth to the movie. So, weak script and story, low quality performances and an odd ending got Magic Mike a 2 out of 10 for me.",Magic Mike
37,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Entertaining yet sincere, Soderbergh and Tatum rip the pants off this drama",7,26 November 2012,"Steven Soderbergh and a movie about male dancers are two things most commonly found on opposite sides of a video store (or completely different categories on your Netflix recommendations, if we're being modern), but behold ""Magic Mike,"" a film that is both, and a film that works surprisingly well.To start, the ""Magic Mike"" script achieves a level of genuine reality more convincing than any ""reality"" television on MTV. The entire film is so sincere — even modest — in its approach, so much so that at times you might suspect Soderbergh's shooting a documentary. Mike (Channing Tatum) is the headliner at an all-male dance revue in Tampa Bay, but he considers himself an entrepreneur as he is saving up to start his own custom furniture business. At one of his day jobs installing roof tile, he eyes a 19-year-old (Alex Pettyfer) named Adam and takes him under his wing, introducing him to the male stripper world.As Mike and Adam bond and we're treated to a behind-the-scenes look at the art of the striptease and the men who perform it, ""Magic Mike"" gets by on this fresh, transparent approach. Soderbergh knows the stripping part has our attention, so he's unafraid to linger a bit longer in scenes in which not much is happening except that we're getting to know the characters. As conflict starts to build, we then feel immersed in the challenges in Mike and Adam's lives to some extent, though the drama never gets quite tense enough.Regardless of what works in terms of story, Tatum gives the best performance of his career to date. He seems as though he's just being himself on camera, which may in part be true as the Reid Carolin's script is loosely based on Tatum's experiences as a male stage dancer. Nonetheless, he's so smooth and natural, especially when his character is asked to joke around, but even when the more weighty material arrives at the end.None of the other characters gets that full range of character development, even Pettyfer's Adam. The character isn't written to really struggle with his huge life transition from college dropout to exotic dancer, but rather to complicate Mike's relationship to stripping as Mike's asked by Adam's older sister, the straight-laced Brooke (Cody Horn), to look after him. Pettyfer hits the more timid notes really well at the beginning, but as his character unravels his performance goes with it.The more things heat up in terms of plot, the more the flaws of ""Magic Mike"" come exposed, even though the entire film engages from start to finish. Someone not as sharp and creative as Soderbergh would've likely delivered the material in a flat, uninspired way given the amount of plain dialogue, but there's no critiquing what didn't happen. Instead, we get everything from wider angles and longer takes to different perspectives and colors that create mood and tension in an otherwise true-to-life and potentially boring story.The relationship between Mike and Brooke, or rather their sexual tension that doesn't amount to anything until it's basically too late, is probably its weakest subplot. A medical assistant, Brooke has little respect for what Mike does, but only so that Carolin's script can preach a little bit about how we shouldn't make assumptions about people who strip to make money. The two don't really belong together, but the script is very into the idea that the fun-loving stripper guy and the stiff nurse-in-training should fall for one another.Yet there's a lot to enjoy about ""Magic Mike,"" which you could say ends up better than a film practically pandering to women ought to be. One of the less apparent strengths is how well Soderbergh captures the power of the striptease as explained to us by Matthew McConaughey's Dallas, the club owner. The dance sequences aren't used purely for sex appeal; between the actors dancing and the extras going wild over them, you can start to understand how self-empowering dancing up on a stage can be and you might actually start to envy the confidence they exude while performing. The film treats exotic dancing with a degree of reverence; it's not a gimmick purely meant to sell tickets — not in this film.Although it swings and misses on the payoff, ""Magic Mike"" depicts honest characters in honest situations behaving as people actually do, creating a unique and never-before-seen context for a drama that boils down to a story of soul searching, about choosing between the easier road or the harder, more fulfilling one when it comes to being the person you want to be.~Steven CThanks for reading!

40,Turfseer,Soderbergh's exploration of vacuous world of male stripping cannot offset tale of budding entrepreneur's redemption,4,28 April 2013,"'Magic Mike' refers to the protagonist of the film, Mike Lane, played by Channing Tatum. Mike is a budding entrepreneur in Tampa, Florida, who is a both a partner and performer in a male strip club, run by its over the top owner, Dallas (Matthew McConaughey). Mike has aspirations to start legitimate businesses, including a custom furniture venture, but must work in the strictly cash male strip club world, in order to fund his other enterprises.Mike takes nineteen-year-old Adam under his wing who's just lost his construction job. Mike falls for Adam's medical assistant sister, Brooke, who looks at his involvement in male stripping with disdain. The film's sub-plot involves Mike's inner struggle to leave his sleazy lifestyle and court Brooke, who represents everything good, wholesome and clean.The main plot of the film involves Adam's fall from grace as he becomes seduced by drug dealers who peddle ecstasy. Adam and Mike perform at a private sorority party and are attacked by the sorority girls' boyfriends, who discover that Adam has been giving ecstasy to some of the girls. During this altercation, Adam leaves a bag worth $10,000 of ecstasy pills at the party and later Mike must pay off drug dealers who are now looking to get even with Adam.At film's end, Adam opts to move to Miami with Dallas who has opened up a bigger and better club. Mike finally has an epiphany that he'll never be able to realize his dreams as a legitimate business owner if he remains in the male strip club world and leaves Dallas and that world for Brooke, who is grateful that Mike bailed out her brother.If you're into male stripping (which I am not), this might be your cup of tea. There are plenty of scenes featuring the male strippers performing in various costumes, suggesting different venues. The female audience at the club seem to get off on the acts of simulated sex, but I suspect that most men watching this stuff will find it a big bore.One of the other problems with the story is that the Brooke character is pretty much one-dimensional. In addition to her devotion to her brother, she represents the wholesome world which Mike aspires to be part of. Hence, Cody Horn as Brooke, has little to do except wait for Mike as he finally transforms himself at the film's climax.Director Steven Soderbergh appears to be ambivalent about the male stripping world he's commenting on. On one hand, he recognizes that such a world is sleazy due to its many connections to the criminal element. For example, Adam's fall from grace is a direct result of his association with such elements. On the other hand, Soderbergh appears to revel in the actual performances of these male strippers (as evidenced by the amount of performance scenes he opts to include in his film). In the end, I wonder if exploring the male strip club world is worthy of a feature length film. Perhaps a documentary might have been more effective. Soderbergh's rather simplistic tale of redemption cannot offset the vacuousness of the world he has chosen to explore.",Magic Mike

Soft version of ""People vs Harry Flint""",7,20 November 2012,"The topic is, of course, sophisticated and many viewers would probably expect watching from the beginning lives full of drugs, constant change of partners irrespective of gender, treason, jealousy, internal emptiness etc. Instead you see a smoothly running movie where dreams and having fun prevail at first and only in the course of logical events cracks break in friendly relations and teamwork. The ending is too plain, however.The cast is pleasant, both appearance and performance, especially McConaughey (what a body and valiance at 40+ years old!) Tatum and Horn.

44,meeza,Not enough muscle for a positive recommendation,7,20 January 2013,"I am aware that I am a heterosexual male humanoid, and I am also aware that one of the ""male rules of cinematic disengagement"" is not to enjoy the male stripper themed movie ""Magic Mike"". Well, there are portions of ""Magic Mike"" that I could bear but there were parts I could not bear. Director Steven Soderbergh's film stars Channing Tatum as the titled Orlando male stripper. Mike sees stripping as a stripping I mean stepping stone to his goal of being a furniture entrepreneur. Mike befriends Young Adam (Alex Pettyfer) at his construction working gig and eventually invites Adam to take a bite out of the world of male stripping. Adam then makes the move from construction to stripping, so yea, he goes from hammering to hammering; I hope I nailed that pun for you. The male strip club's owner is the showman Dallas, who is portrayed by the comeback acting kid (well, maybe he is not a kid anymore) of 2012, Matthew McConaughey. Now in the stripper limelight, Adam disrobes himself to the world of hard partying, heavy drugs, and sexual ""triventures"". Mike takes a liking to Adam's sister Brooke (Cody Horn), even though she disapproves the wild lifestyle that her brother and Mike engage in. There are a few more developments that are stringed out in ""Magic Mike""; but in reality, none that were magnetic enough to be captivating. I know that Soderbergh is a talented filmmaker, but somehow I think he simplified ""Magic Mike"" to be just a regular film about characters trying to reach financial success with no complex ingredients added to the mix; which is not really in his directorial nature. There was nothing in Reid Caroline's screenplay for me to think it was a ""Sweet Caroline"" script. However, what I feel salvaged ""Magic Mike"" was the charismatic performances from Channing Tatum as Mike and Matthew McConaughey as Dallas. But unfortunately I cannot say the same for the rest of the cast which included Pettyfer, Horne, and others that did not unveil their characters as much as I wanted them to; and please do not take that in another context. Again, I am a proud of my heterosexuality. ""Magic Mike"" does have its moments, but I think the naked truth is that is just a semi-plausible film. *** Average",Magic Mike
45,estebangonzalez10,Tatum shares some of his past with us,8,11 December 2012,"¨The law says you cannot touch, but I see a lot of lawbreakers up in this house.¨To be honest I was feeling pretty uncomfortable watching this film during the first half hour, but once I got immersed in this world and watched where the story was heading I ended up enjoying it quite a bit. The film is directed by Steven Soderbergh, who probably made his best films over a decade ago (Out of Sight, Erin Brockovich, Traffic, and Ocean's Eleven) although I did enjoy last year's film: Contagion. Magic Mike is perhaps one of his best movies in the past ten years and thanks mostly to a great leading performance from Channing Tatum and an impressive supporting role from Matthew McConaughey. The script written by Reid Carolin was also quite entertaining, with some very funny moments. The story is loosely based on Tatum's experience as a male stripper before he became a movie celebrity. He was one of the producers of the film and I think the movie does a good job at exploring this unknown world for the majority of us. He is excellent in this film and really delivers despite not being an actor who receives too much recognition for his work. McConaughey seemed to have a lot of fun with his role here and he could receive a nomination for his supporting performance. Alex Pettyfer also delivers a strong performance as the new kid. The rest of the cast is mostly known for their roles in different television series. I ended up having a fun time with this film and despite the very predictable ending I still recommend it. My only complaint is that I felt the ending was a little rushed and abrupt. Mike (Channing Tatum) is a male stripper at night, and a construction worker during the day. He's been in the business for several years and has been saving money to become an entrepreneur although his bad credit history has prevented him from getting loans from the bank. He seems to be living the good life working for Dallas (Matthew McConaughey) at the strip club along with Richie (Joe Manganiello), Ken (Matt Bomer), Tito (Alex Rodriguez), and Tarzan (Kevin Nash). They seem to be doing really good together and business looks good for all. Mike meets a nineteen year old kid named Adam (Alex Pettyfer) at a construction site and decides to invite him to the club. He introduces Adam to the boss and he instantly becomes a hit with the ladies. The Kid (as they call Adam) and Mike get along really well and when Adam's sister, Brooke (Cody Horn), finds about her little brother stripping she begins to worry. Mike calms her down and guarantees he will look after her brother. The three share a pretty nice relationship, but soon the Kid begins to get into drug problems. Mike's lifestyle begins to take a toll on him, but Mike really looks after him despite all the partying and girls. Dallas wants to expand the Tampa based show and relocate it in Miami Beach, but the real question is whether or not the boys could adapt and survive in that environment.I was surprised to find out that Tatum and Pettyfer didn't get along on set because in the film it felt as if they really shared some chemistry. I also liked the scenes between Tatum and Cody Horn. Their conversations were probably the funniest scenes in the movie and they did have a lot of chemistry together. The rest of the crew didn't have much screen time other than the choreographed dancing numbers that I found really funny, but I guess most girls enjoyed. The guys in this film really make us feel bad about our bodies because they are totally ripped. The ending is your typical Hollywood ending, but I still enjoyed the film for all the other issues it tried to explore. I really respect Tatum. I thought he was hilarious in 21 Jump Street and proved he can star in more than chick flicks. We all know what McConaughey is capable of and he proves it once again here in Magic Mike shinning in every scene he was in. He was excellent in his role in this year's Bernie as well. Magic Mike may not have an original ending, but it is a good film that will entertain you and leave a smile on your face.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",Magic Mike

Yes its about male strippers and that's the good part. The dancing scenes are fun, sexy and filled with some prime men. The other underlying storyline though is dull, disjointed and easily forgettable. And even though I think I was meant to I definitely didn't feel sorry for any of the characters.I guess I just wanted more from this after all the hype. Its also been filmed (except for the dancing scenes) using some weird yellow tint which I found distracting and I couldn't stand Cody Horn who played Brooke, the f-bombing sister of ""The Kid"" and Mikes love interest.On the plus side Channing Tatum can really dance, and is worth the price of admission just for his sleek, sexy choreographed stripping routines. Matthew McConaughey is also kind of amazing here. Alright, alright, alright the man can act and wow that body but also... what a freaking nut bar.The story (as it were) follows veteran male stripper ""Magic Mike"" as he teaches his protégé about seducing women, making big bucks and hard partying in a ""comedy drama"" inspired by Channing Tatum's life before he became an actor.All in I don't think I would bother watching this again however I have watched The Full Monty several times, its a good stripper movie. 11/7/15",Magic Mike
47,davispittman,Better than XXL and more than just stripping,9,3 April 2017,"Magic Mike (2012) is one of my favorite movies. Okay I'm gonna review this film in two different ways. First: the stripping and sexy part, the stuff they advertised and why it attracted a lot of people. Okay so the sex appeal and stripping is definitely reason enough to see this movie. Every single male entertainer is very very attractive and KNOWS how to perform. Alex Petyffer, Channing Tatum, Adam Rodriquez, Matt Bomer, and Matthew McConaughey are all to die for in this film, very irresistible, and that is needed in the film because it's about strippers for gods sake, they have to be sexy and they must know how to perform the routines well, and believe me, they got that COVERED. And I enjoyed that part of the movie very much, it feels like you're actually in the audience. Now for the second aspect of the movie: the drama, the meat, everything other than the sexy stripteases. The actors in the movie are a lot more than just sexy guys who can get down like nobodies business. Channing Tatum gives a terrific performance! I absolutely loved his portrayal of Mike. He was very sweet and kind hearted, he wasn't just some typical arrogant male stripper that has sex every 5 minutes, no his character was so layered and detailed, and I loved seeing those layers peel back, getting to see the ""real Mike"". Alex Petyffer was also very good, he wasn't as good as Tatum, but he still turned in a pretty good performance. His character was not as detailed and layered, his did have some depth, but not as much. Matthew McConaughey gives a wonderful performance! I loved him in this movie, he's so into his role and so intense with everything. The scene where he's ""teaching"" Adam how to tease and dance is sooo well done. The way Matthew moves, the way he talks to him, what he says is all written and acted out perfectly. The movie address both the highs and lows of being an adult entertainer. There are scenes where it shows the potential harms of being in that industry. And I liked that, gave it more depth. Cody Horn is great in this movie! I loved her performance, it was very real and serious a lot of the time, then she could get loose and fun when she needed to. All in all its a sexy movie with great acting, good writing, and more depth than one might expect.",Magic Mike

Who certainly loves his job, entertaining the ladies, having parties and the occasional one night stand. But Mike doesn't want to be a stripper for the rest for his life, he is hoping to get his own business. In the same time, he takes an chance on a young, aimless, handsome 19 year old man by the name of Adam (Alex Pettyfer) to be his protégé. Adam starts to enjoy the nightlife world of male strippers, especially dancing for beautiful ladies of all sorts. While Mike is slowly starts to enjoy Adam's friendship and Adam's worried older sister Brooke (Cody Horn).Directed by Oscar-Winner:Steven Soderbergh (The ""Ocean"" Series, Erin Brockovich, Haywire) made an entertaining dramatic comedy that offers fine performances, including Matthew McConaughey as Tatum's sleazy nightclub owner. Tatum has some impressive dance skills, certainly no surprise for those, who have seen ""Step Up"". The male strippers cast seems to be having an great time with the dances.The Blu-ray has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) 1080p transfer and an superb DTS 5.1 HD Sound. The extras are sadly disappointing, i was hoping an commentary track, more featurettes or deleted scenes. We do get an brief featurette, play all dances option and three extended dance sequences (The highlight is the ""Ken"" doll dance scene). ""Magic Mike"" for some tastes by certain film critics and audiences was not the sleazier male stripping movie, they were expecting. But ""Magic Mike"" is mostly original piece of work. Soderbergh shows the nightlife of the male stripping world quite nicely. Which it is not all sleazy, most male strippers do it to entertained the costumers and for a few male strippers, it is just an job after all. Fine adult entertainment. Soderbergh also did the cinematography and editing of the film in a pseudonym fashion. HD Widescreen/Hawk-Scope. (****/*****).",Magic Mike
49,rooprect,"Trailer is misleading, great movie though",8,4 December 2014,"The upbeat trailer with quippy banter, cute gags and promises of washboard abs & tight tushies is very misleading. And the IMDb plot summary makes me want to hurl: ""A male stripper teaches a younger performer how to party, pick up women, and make easy money."" ""Magic Mike"" is a great movie but for different reasons and for a different audience than the trailer may attract. It's not a fun & wild romp nor is it a quirky romcom with a lot of chuckles. It's a complex drama that focuses on success vs. the illusion of success. It could've been set on Wall Street. It could've been set in a law firm. It could've been set in any one of the paragons of success that we envision when we hear that word. Instead it's set in a male nudie bar with tons of hormone-raging women waving, hurling and stuffing $1 bills into mens' thong underwear.Soderbergh crafts a powerful but almost self-defeating film that I doubt will be a huge popularity winner due to its unconventional story. (Sidenote: why is it that filmmakers can make critically-acclaimed masterpieces about female strippers/prostitutes, like ""Leaving Las Vegas"", but if the g-string is on the other gender it's just goofy fun?) Due to its deceptive marketing, ""Magic Mike"" is passed off as crowd-pleasing entertainment, but it's really a very sobering look at life with more introspective moments than laughs.Channing Tatum plays Mike, a guy with the bod of a Greek god, probably not very educated but with a very smart, creative ambition: to build artistic furniture. Somehow, instead, he ends up thrusting his pelvis on stage for screaming ladies. Enter Adam (Alex Pettyfer), a 19-year-old kid who, like many 19-year-olds, doesn't have a clue. Mike takes Adam under his wing and introduces him to the night life, all the while promising Adam's sister Brooke (Cody Horn) that he'll take care of Adam.If you can see where this is going, then great. That's the point. ""Magic Mike"" does something that few films have the guts to do. It sets up a predictable situation and then takes us through exactly that. No wacky, contrived plot twists necessary. Instead it focuses on how different people react and change when confronted with a predictable set of events.Another thing this film does, better than any other I've seen in recent memory, is that it gives us REAL dialogue. I'm talking about the scenes between Mike & Brooke. It's every bit as real as something you'd experience in real life, right down to the stammering, the awkward fidgeting, the ""flubbed lines"". I put that in quotations because I'm not sure if the script was written that way, or if Tatum actually flubbed a few lines and Soderbergh left them in. My point is that the dialogue & chemistry between those two is so believable you'd think they didn't have a camera on them.""Magic Mike"" is not for everyone. It can't be accurately summed up with some exuberant catchphrase like ""Laugh out loud funny!"" or ""A tragic masterpiece!"" or ""Nail biting suspense!"" Also I would say that this is a very uncomfortable date movie, a very uncomfortable bro movie, and it's probably too heavy for a fun, gal's night out movie. If you do see it, it's probably best watched alone so you can really soak in the personal story it's telling. On an individual level I think we can all relate to the idea of being sidetracked by the pursuit of a dream, rather than the dream itself, regardless of if we're guys wearing buttless cowboy pants in front of 200 squealing, undersexed women.",Magic Mike

He helps out a down-and-out teenager named Adam (Alex Pettyfer) to earn his own money by stripping, with obvious dire consequences later on. Wait, you might think, haven't I seen that movie before? Believe me, you have with just some different circumstances, but the same old story. The performances by both Channing and Alex were similarly paint-by-numbers, nothing spectacular. Channing's past career as a stripper though is very apparent with his dancing scenes.Ever annoying actor Matthew McConaughey once again comes up with yet another annoying performance as the owner of the Tampa strip club ""Xquisite"". His over-the-top acting was very BAD. Aside from Channing, Alex and Matthew, the rest of the guys on the poster namely TV stars Matt Bomer and Joe Manganiello just dance without ANY significant lines. They could be any actor and it wouldn't have mattered. There was an old wrestler-looking guy there onstage with them called Tarzan (Kevin Nash) who looked awkward and out of place.The few females in the story were hardly attractive. Cody Horn, who played Adam's stuck-up sister Brooke, was awkward all throughout. Even her scene in a bikini was not flattering. Olivia Munn played Joanna, a psychologist who researched about, then played around with Mike. Her reported breast exposure in the beginning was cut from local screenings. Ironically, the prolonged butt exposure of Channing Tatum before that scene was left fully intact. (So, why the double standard, local censors?) Ultimately, if you are not watching this for the stripping scenes, there really isn't much else to watch here.",Magic Mike
51,jadepietro,Thongs for the Memories,6,1 July 2012,"This film is mildly recommended. Perhaps I should stop now before even beginning my review of Magic Mike, a film that is far from magical and even further from the the truth. But I just can't look away, no matter how hard they try. All of the rippling muscles, chiseled biceps, and well-defined abs have been assembled and neatly packaged for our enjoyment, but much of that becomes background fodder to the film's formulaic plot.The trailer and sexual hype misleads its audience into thinking that this film is a no holds bar exposé into the firm underbelly of male strip clubs, a kind of guilty pleasure that will service its fans as well as titillate and arouse its patronage. No, it's not a male Showgirls ( although that would have been far more fun ) and it takes itself too seriously midway through the film, becoming a bit of a downer.Magic Mike is all surface treatment, a superficial and sanitized cautionary tale of a lovable lunk of a hunk ( Channing Tatum ) who dreams of becoming a furniture designer by day and gyrates and grinds his other junk at night. He should keep his night job.The silly story ( based on Mr. Tatum's own meager beginnings ) takes us into the seedy and lucrative world of exotic male dancers at Xquisite, a Florida strip club owned by its oily ( literally ) master of ceremony, Dallas ( Matthew McConaughey ). Taking top billing there is our title character, Magic Mike ( winningly played by Channing Tatum in his best performance since Stop / Loss ). His hard bodied associates include Ken ( Matt Bomer ), Tito ( Adam Rodriguez ), Tarzan ( Kevin Nash ) and Big Dick Richie ( Joe Manganiello ) , all overdeveloped physically and underdeveloped script-wise. Joining the family is Adam The Kid ( Alex Pettyfer ), a beginner who has big ambitions and limited abilities. Of course, Mike steps in as his big brother and mentor, whereas he meets and falls for Adam's no-nonsense sister, Brooke ( Cody Horn ). All so predictable.Their courtship seems labored, with no real chemistry between the actors; the melodrama is even weaker. The only real excitement actually comes from the musical numbers and synchronized choreography in the clubs. ( Tatum has a particularly spirited hip-hop dance that rewards the moviegoer with its high energy and precision between all of the heavy- handed exposition and dull sub-plots. ) Steven Soderbergh tries to pump some life into this film with his clever edits and stylized use of colors, but most of the time, the film wallows in its own artificiality. It is never remotely real or engrossing. The director also sacrifices the dance routines too often by undercutting those moments for scenes of drug abuse, sexual couplings, and assorted sleaze that never mixes that well with the lighter moments of romance.The only real performance comes from McConaughey as Dallas who makes his corrupt and immoral character come alive. The actor displays a sinister and shady side one moment while presenting a caring and father-like role the next. He also plays with the audience throughout the film, morphing into a man who can be one part entrepreneur and two parts whore. This is McConaughey finest performance in years.The film purports itself to be a tell-all about the sex industry but tells nothing at all about that seedier side of life. It's like spending a couple of hours with a cheap escort and not get any real satisfaction. Magic Mike is cinematic foreplay without any emotional climax. GRADE: B-",Magic Mike
52,Seraphion,"Too many montages, but still a good presentation",7,28 August 2015,"The movie nicely captured the world of the male strippers and even went well in supplanting the drama to make itself a more cinematic experience. I like how the movie keeps the story in check by presenting the developments quite strictly one by one so the audience is at the same pace in understanding how the movie progresses. The drama on this movie is also nice to considers since the movie made it that it rolls out in a clam way that you don't really anticipate the sudden conflicts when they roll in, even though they really are predictable considering how volatile Adam's character stated by Brooke. I like How the movie keeps itself hanging at the end and readying the audience for a clear sequel to wait to. Yet the movie is full with all those montages that took too long and really wasted much of the movie's duration given that don't really help in advancing the story further. The acting overall is quite nice. Channing Tatum did well in getting into his character. Alex Pettyfer also did well and seemed pretty easy in portraying the volatile and aimless kid.",Magic Mike
53,rgkarim,Is it Magical?,6,1 July 2012,"Surely you've all been hearing about the movie all the girls and women are flocking to this weekend. Yes that's right it's Channing Tatum's newest flick, Magic Mike, where every woman's fantasy comes true. While most women and nonstraight men are calling it a great movie, and most straight guys are calling it a disaster, this reviewer decided to once again travel into the theater. I'll admit now that seeing the trailers I was expecting a lot of ab shots of Channing and the other dudes, with brief interludes for developing a very predictable and classic story line. Boy was I wrong, as this movie has so much more than I predicted which for once was not a good thing. So read on if you wish to learn more about the latest light porno, Magic Mike. For those who haven't been fooled by the trailer yet, Magic Mike is a story of Mike a hardworking man who lives in Florida. To obtain his dreams of opening up a custom furniture business, which look like Andy Warhol designs, he works numerous jobs, one of which is stripping. Yes that's right Mikes main source of income is showing off his body to countless women who are happy to line his skanky underwear with bills. However, one lady manages to penetrate the flock of cougars, drunks, and dreamers and somehow manages to stimulate something deeper in him. However that magical/shallow story was just a front for the real magic the directing team had in mind. Although Magic Mike was crafted to portray the life of a stripper, which was Channing's life prior to being an actor, it is in fact a film to appease women with eye candy. While the abs are used to bait unsuspecting audience members into the theater, the rest of the magic comes in the form of countless shots of bare bottoms, uncovered boobs, and a few glimpses of the male genitalia. The raunchiness doesn't stop there though as the cameras take it one step further to allow one to see males and females have sex and touch parts without any consequence at all. Why women were screaming and clapping delight for watching these scenes I'll never know, but for me this light porno was rather disgusting and trashy. Despite the graphic nudity though, I will admit this movie was able to bring the male erotic dancing world to life, capturing the backstage and onstage life in all its ""glory"". The setting, cheesy skits, and bass driven music was combined to make a show that will have women of all ages drooling. Tatum, although not the best actor, can certainly dance, and like his first movie the man still has moves that are impressive. Unfortunately it's not enough to save the movie from its countless weaknesses As for the story, well it's different from the generic love story I thought I'd be forced to watch and in fact is a tale of two strippers. One story focuses on the rise and fall of the character named Adam and his dive into the world of female entertainment. The second and perhaps main story of course is on the fall and rise of Mike, part of which involves the lovely lady you've seen in the trailer. Unfortunately both tales involve the excessive consumption of alcohol, which the movie seems to endorse as the only way to have a good time in the world today. It's hard for this reviewer to remember a scene where Adam or Mike weren't hung over or without a beer in their hands, which to me is just sad. Although they show the horror of drug usage, Magic Mike also has some graphic drug use and humor that I didn't care for. Although it is most likely used to highlight the low points of their lives, showing multiple shots of drug induced highs, sex, and violence is not my idea of a good time. Were there any positives to this movie? Yes, but for me they were very weak positives that I can't really say are worth a trip to theater. The biggest strength perhaps is the music, which is fitting for the countless dance numbers, and party scenes in the movie. However, for those not big on techno music/ heavy rock you're out of luck. If you're wondering about the dialog, well when it's not using the F word seven times in the same sentence, it's using rather cheesy innuendos that are more eye rolling than lots of laughing. Yet there a few lines that are golden in the sea of trash that are good for a quick laugh, but again they are few and far in between. As for the acting, well Matthew McConaughey being the chameleon he is, knows how to play a sleazy alcoholic well. Tatum also does his part justice, and may for once be the best actor of the crew, though he still needs work on delivering his lines less awkwardly/kiddy. As for Alex Pettyfer well he knows how to play an arrogant, smart alek, bum who can be an idiotic jerk well, which I applaud. I'm pretty sure that if you're a fan of light pornos, Channing Tatum's body, or stripper movies you will absolutely love this film. However, there is not much to this film other than countless stripping and sexual gestures. With a rather shallow plot, weak dialog, and some rather pointless shots I can't say there is much to promote about this movie. If this review isn't too late than I suggest the only reason for going to the movies to see this film is for a bachelorette party situation, otherwise wait until the DVD/Netflix release. Warning don't take your preteen or teenage daughter to see it until you have tried it or you may be in for a surprise. Here are the scores: Comedy/Drama: 6.0-6.5 Movie Overall: 4.0",Magic Mike
54,p-stepien,Bumtastic. Or not.,5,13 January 2013,"Teenager Adam (Alex Pettyfer) is lost in existence with no real calling or suggestions as to how to better his livelihood. Luckily enough he has a nice bod, appealing facade and some predispositions for shaking that thang. Convinced by 30-year old star male stripper Magic Mike (Channing Tatum), Adam starts shedding clothes for hysterical women at Kings of Tampa in Florida. Magic Mike soon becomes his mentor, trying to focus his path and reorient his goals, also partly due to Adam's sister Joanna (Olivia Munn), a nurse who is very protective of her younger sibling. The whole joint is led by Dallas (a surprisingly convincing Matthew McConaughey), a veteran in the field and still overwhelmingly a crowd-pleaser.Scripted by former stripper Channing Tatum and directed by Steven Soderbergh comes a mixed bag of dramaturgy delivered in what seems like an overly recognisable package. Despite the stronger narrative focus and cast / crew pedigree the movie feels somewhat all too reminiscent of a mascunilized version of ""Coyote Ugly"". Thankfully Soderbergh avoids the moral judgement of stripping itself, instead focusing on human weaknesses which collide with morality, when easy access to cash, drugs, women and illusory success is supplied. However the overall strong points are immersed within a meandering plot, which fails to really convey its goal. Instead everything seems just too familiar and predictable with all the change of hearts or downfalls foreseeable well in advance. The themes running around the movie are well tread, with the sole difference stemming from supplanting women for men. Added bonus for women is a screen overflowing with ripped bodies and sexual innuendo.",Magic Mike
55,Matt_Layden,A boring and uninspired mess.,5,8 July 2012,"Mike is a stripper by night and wannabe entrepreneur by day. While at a roofing gig, he meets Adam and they instantly hit it off. Mike introduces Adam is his night life, of stripping and Adam soon finds himself thrust into the wild and wacky world of male stripping. Adam's sister isn't to keen on the idea and makes Mike promise that he will take care of her brother, but the money, girls and drugs soon becomes too much of a temptation for Adam to resist.Inspired by Channing Tatum's early life as a real male stripper, Magic Mike is an odd bag. It aims to please the female audience and yet it has a director that male audiences respond to. Steven Soderbergh is behind the lens and he gives the film a visual flare that is more or less his signature style. The film is not all about the loud, crude and overly sexual sequences involving the young (and not so young) men dancing up a storm on stage, it tries to dig deeper into the lives of these boys with Tatum as the lead anchor. There are two big problems Magic Mike faces, the first is the running time, which is atrociously long. Running ten minutes shy of two hours, the film drags and drags in a lot of scenes that do not involve losing clothing. The reason is that the story, or lack there of, is boring. We follow two characters, Mike and Adam, a master and protégé type relationship. Tatum has never been known for his acting skills and here it is no different. He awkwardly spews out his lines and looks uncomfortable doing anything off the stage. On the stage is a different story, as his dance moves (have you seen Step-Up?) take front and centre stage. He has talent and his real life experience is clearly evident here. He was the best stripper of the bunch. Adam, played by I Am Number Four's Alex Pettyfer is a boring character that has no likability factor. Mark Walhberg's Dirk Diggler in Boogie Nights was the fish out of water character that fell from grace and he did it with a schoolboy charm. Alex portrays the character as cold and unlikable. With two lead characters that aren't very good, it seems that the rest of the strippers have to pick up the slack. Matthew McConaughey is the club owner, Dallas, who dreams of bigger and better things in Miami. He gets his chance to shine at the end and of course, spends 90% of the film with no shirt on. No stretch for him there. There is a bit of a subplot involving him and Tatum in which McConaughey more or less screws him over. It's only slightly touched upon and never drives the film. The other male strippers, involving a CSI agent, a former wrestler and a werewolf, have absolutely nothing to do in this film aside from being strippers. We get a sense that Tarzan (Kevin Nash) is too old to be doing this, but the film never bothers to do anything with his character. He seems odd and out of place. They each get their own strip scenes, mostly done in montages, but nothing more. The stripping/dancing scenes are the most interesting aspects of the film and I fond myself bored with everything else. It tries to be more than a stripper movie, but it fails at it. It's not fun, it's not dramatic it's stuck in the middle and it seems to be an autopilot a lot of the time. I think if the film had taken more chances and tried to be darker, it could have been somewhere along the lines of Boogie Nights for the stripper industry. Instead it has to settle for a film that women in their 50's rush to go see so they can see some man butt. It's a shame because Soderbergh is such a talent, that it seems wasted here.",Magic Mike
56,moviewizguy,"The law says you cannot touch, but I think I see a lotta lawbreakers up in this house tonight...",9,27 June 2012,"Many people like to generalize things to make it easier to understand the world. When the trailer for MAGIC MIKE was revealed, it was labeled as just a ""male stripper movie,"" like how BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN was just a ""gay cowboy movie."" This generic label, undermining and downgrading the film's actual quality, even overshadows the fact that Steven Soderbergh is the director, who rarely make films that lack substance. Yes, MAGIC MIKE has style, but it has substance as well. Here's the kicker: Those who want to see the film primarily for the stripping may be left disappointed, as they will likely fidget in their seats for these scenes to come. As one lady sitting next to me said once the credits rolled, ""Worst movie ever."" On the other hand, those who refuse to see the film because of its subject matter may be missing a great film.To state it simply, MAGIC MIKE is a BOOGIE NIGHTS-lite, which isn't a bad thing considering how utterly dark and depressing BOOGIE NIGHTS gets in its second half. The first half of MAGIC MIKE is light and breezy and quite funny. In fact, most of the jokes in here are funnier than most modern comedies try to achieve. We are introduced to this world that is fascinating because of how surprisingly mundane and economics-centered it is. The stripping sequences, filled with energy and sexiness, are mostly played for laughs. We get exposed to a lot of male asses, ripped abs, and pelvic thrusts, but it's all in good fun. Then, things slowly start to take a dark turn in the second half. It isn't hard to imagine people thinking, ""Wait. Isn't this a stripping movie?"" Characters start to make bad decisions and one thing leads to another and so on. You get the idea.The cast is terrific all around. Channing Tatum is very good as the lead role, playing comedy and drama effectively. However, I want to give a huge shout out to Alex Pettyfr and Cody Horn, both pulling off terrific performances in their substantial roles. Pettyfr, in particular, I never really liked in the films he starred in before, but he is just phenomenal in this film. Horn, on the other hand, seemed to come out from nowhere, but her rapport with Tatum is terrific. Let's also not forget about Matthew McConaughey. Even though he isn't in the film that much, he steals every single scene he's in. He's just that good.MAGIC MIKE will either surprise or disappoint you, depending on what your expectations are. Still, it's a film BOTH genders can enjoy, and it shouldn't be limited to ""a movie for the ladies."" MAGIC MIKE is funny and dramatic when it needs to be, but the main reason it succeeds is because of the cast. Overall, MAGIC MIKE is a very good film. Just don't expect a lot of stripping.",Magic Mike
57,valadas,Flogging a dead horse,6,4 January 2013,"Steven Soderbergh is indeed a great movie director. He knows too well how to direct the performers, how to have lively dialogues made, how to chose the best framings and the adequate sceneries and how to supervise the most efficient cut. This he have done also in this movie. He was however flogging a dead horse by telling a poor dramatic story. This movie in fact tells us about the life of male strippers and male stripping business. This is however a very uninteresting subject and even not socially important. Furthermore the plot is dramatically poor and superficial. Is it trying yo convince us that the so called Magic Mike guy was different from the others and capable of normal feelings and conscience? If so it was not convincing enough. Not exactly a totally bad movie but one you don't have anything to gain by watching.",Magic Mike
58,saadgkhan,"Dull, unreal and boring at times",4,17 October 2012,"Magic Mike – CATCH IT (C+) Magic Mike may have been promoted as a male stripping movie but turns out to me more than just a stripping movie which may be a good thing for the critics but not for the audiences. The movie starts covers June and July but gives no reason what's the reason behind mentioning the months in big bold letters. I could not figure out whether it's a rom-com or it's about struggling man trying to make something out of his miserable lie serious I didn't not get anything at all. And worst thing is in the end, there is no ending as such. What's his future, what does he do, he doesn't have any plan anything it was all left hanging by Mr. Soderbergh. Among all stars I have to say Matthew McConaughey, Cody Horn (surprisingly, since I hated her in the promos) and Olivia Munn stands out for me. And even among these characters I found Cody Horn the only sensible one which made some sense. All other characters are so vague and pretentious that it was hard to relate to anyone of them. Channing Tatum is doing well these days and does a good job again after The Vow and 21 Jump Street. I use to like Alex Pettyfer a lot but now I think he is overrated and not that good of an actor. Joe Manganiello, Matt Bomer and Adam Rodriguez all did a fine job in shaking their assists' on the floor. Olivia Munn was very natural and somehow I really starting to liker her after watching her in ""The Newsroom"". In the end, I found the movie quite boring at times and didn't understand the purpose behind it. If it was entertainment then I have to say it wasn't entertaining.",Magic Mike
59,rivertam26,The Magic is that it's a solid flick,8,17 July 2012,"This was without a doubt one of the year's most anticipated films for me, being a gay man who crushes on hot hunky celebs like Channing Tatum, Alex Pettyfer, Matthew Bomber, Adam Rodriguez, Matthew McConaghey and Joe Manginello I was looking for too seeing them shed their wardrobe and show some celebrity skin. Well I was definitely not disappointed. But for other reasons that I would have expected. The film centers on Channing Tatum as a 30 y/o male stripper/ entrepreneur who takes on a young kid (Pettyfer) and shows him the ropes of the stripping industry. it is of course all fun and games at the beginning before the film moves into a cautionary morality tale of sorts with a hopeful wink. Most impressive here besides the steamy dance sequences, hard abs and sculpted bodies are the performances behind them. The screenplay is just fleshy enough to dive the stars some great moments and Soderbergh makes his best film in years. Channing Tatum is really solid in the lead making Mike charming, easy to relate t and showing a surprising amount of range moving from a fun loving guy to an individual more aware of his lifestyle and his choices. Matthew McConaghey gives his best performance in years as sort of the pseudo big brother/ club manager who seems protective but has a creepy, exploitative agenda behind the facade he presents. Alex Pettyfer also has his best role to date managing some good moments in a small but effective turn. Most impressive however is the newbie Cody Horn as the Kid's sister and Channing Tatum's love interest. She possess that rare it factor that just makes her shine on screen. She feels real, easy to relate too and likable and has a killer moment of emotional complexity. And that's really how the film works as well because behind all the hard bodies and fantastical dance numbers the film doesn't shy away from touching on the darker aspects of the material if not fully exploring them. Soderbergh directs with his signature style of seemingly improvised dialogue and retro close ups. The film feels raw, realistic and a little amateur which adds to the films overall unpolished effect. It's not a perfect film but a much better one than it has any right to be especially considering the cheeky subject matter. The real Magic in Magic Mike though is that a good film can be made about anything if the people involved have something interesting to say and know how to say it.",Magic Mike
60,napierslogs,The lifestyle of male strippers with characters and dichotomies,7,3 July 2012,"Mike (Channing Tatum) is a stripper. He's also a contractor and furniture business entrepreneur. He's actually a pretty stand-up young man. Adam (Alex Pettyfer) isn't as put together, but his sister wants him to be. So when she ventures out to Xquisite, the all male dance revue, she exclaims ""I was hoping it was all a joke."" I don't blame her, I thought it was too. Mike responds, ""No, but it is pretty funny."" He's also right.""Magic Mike"" is indeed about a male strip club. The other strippers and their routines were all very funny. They definitely went too far at times, but I think that was part of the joke. Matthew McConaughey, as the club owner, seemed to be playing a character playing himself. A sort of tongue-in-cheek joke making fun of the types of roles he gets. He was fearless, willing to say or do anything to get the joke. There is something special about an actor like that.Shortly before the release, positive critics reviews started coming out plus the realization that this was directed by Steven Soderbergh. It makes one think that perhaps there is more to this movie than just guys stripping. Well, yes and no. The majority of this movie is about the lifestyle that accompanies male strippers with plenty of scenes for the predominantly female audience to ogle at their dance moves. As expected, that gets annoying quickly.Also as expected, the lifestyle that accompanies male strippers involves easy women and drugs, all of which can be bought with a lot of money. Mike tries to stay out of that style of living. He knows what he wants in life and the ""proper"" way to get it. On the other hand, Adam very much wants the hard-living style; that's exactly where he wants to be in life. This leads to a brilliant sequence, near the end of the film, where Mike is old enough to be passed his quarter-life crisis while Adam is just approaching his. But one is at more of a cross-roads than the other.I am also assuming that Soderbergh has chosen to direct this just to do something different. Choosing interesting light effects and strange camera angles, just for fun I suppose. This is a genre that is not known for being inventive and I don't think much of his effort was necessary. But the characters and particularly their dichotomies that he added makes the film worth it.",Magic Mike
61,blott2319-1,"More than just a stripping fetish movie, but still not fun for me",6,1 October 2020,"I'll readily admit that Magic Mike is more than just a movie built to titillate women with repeated male stripper scenes. That stuff is certainly present in the film, and does take up large chunks of time, but there is a story going on in this movie as well. Mike is a compelling character, and I thought it was interesting how we can intuit things that have gone on in his past just based on context clues. The same could be said of his future hopes as well, which are hinted at from one of the first moments of the film. He doesn't need a scene where he sits down and tells his entire sob story, because the director Steven Soderbergh and writer Reid Carolin know how to develop characters without a boatload of exposition. I also appreciated that Channing Tatum was allowed to have a good sense of humor and they wrote some jokes for him. I am still not convinced he is the most nuanced actor when it comes to heavy emotional stuff, but when he's allowed to be a little light-hearted and fun, his charisma is electric.The story in Magic Mike isn't exactly my kind of thing. It reminded me a lot of biopics about musicians in the way we watch the limelight of growing fame and fortune slowly destroy Adam. I find these tales of corrupting influences (particularly the damaging effects of sex, drugs, and rock-and-roll) to be tired and played out. Not to mention, these plotlines are depressing. Add into all that ugliness the fact that I'm completely disinterested in the world of male stripping, and you have a film that simply turns me off. In fact, my favorite scenes in the film are the ones most isolated from the seedy world featured in the rest of the story. Any time Cody Horn was on the screen it was like a ray of light and hope in an otherwise bleak film. But I can't deny that Magic Mike was well-made and has a story to tell. This is way better than I thought it would be, considering the nature of its subject matter. I wonder if women were horribly disappointed in Magic Mike because, instead of solely offering visual pleasure, it rips back the curtain and reveals the ugly side of stripping.",Magic Mike
62,Joxerlives,A surprisingly fun male version of 'Striptease'.,6,29 September 2014,"Watched this largely out of curiosity, male strippers not really my thing (to say the least) but I don't disapprove, if guy/gay girls can have Spearmint Rhino then straight girls/gay men can have male strippers. That being so I guess a film dealing with the subject would be treading on some pretty thin material. Glad to say I was actually mistaken and this has a pretty good story and some excellent performances in between all the rippling six-packs and thrusting pelvises. You wonder nowadays could mainstream Hollywood make a similar film about female strippers and their motivations without being branded as sexist?A few criticisms, there seems to be a lack of gay characters, couldn't there have been at least one homosexual couple amongst the strippers? Also couldn't we have had a bit more depth to some of the clients? I would have liked a gay special night and some older ladies in the audience. It would have been a funny scene for one of their mothers to be spotted amongst the screaming fans.Ultimately it is a very traditional story of the man who thinks he has it all (money, casual threesomes with sexy bimbos who can't even remember one another's names, getting paid to work out all the time and have everyone fawning over you nightly). But eventually he sees the pitfalls, that it's shallow, the perils of drugs and that it is essentially a younger man's game and that you have a very limited shelf life as a career.

63,dglink,"More Magic, Mike, More Magic",6,10 July 2012,"Steven Soderbergh's ""Magic Mike"" is short on needed magic. The promised backstage tale of male strippers conjures images of sexy men, pulsating music, and erotic choreography. Unfortunately, the expected companion piece to ""Flashdance"" or ""Footloose"" is not even ""The Full Monty."" Magic Mike, competently played by Channing Tatum, is a construction worker by day, a stripper by night, and a furniture designer by ambition. A fellow hard hat on the construction site, Adam, played by Alex Pettyfer, is drawn into Mike's stripper world by the lure of easy money and even easier sex. Little unexpected happens, and the audience for naked male flesh and sexual couplings is better served at the local porn shop.The dialog is lame and often delivered listlessly. Perhaps strippers and their friends are low-key characters and talk like Mike and his friends, but eyes glaze and brains go numb after nearly two hours spent in their company. A physically fit Matthew McConaughey looks almost cadaverous as Dallas, the strippers' tough manager. However, McConaughey is effective, and his scenes resuscitate the film when he is on screen, which is all too briefly. Despite his age, McConaughey has the vulgar moves, the erotic gyrations, and the sexual aura that the other supposed strippers lack.""Magic Mike"" drags on and seems longer than it is. Soderbergh inserts a few arty shots, but generally fails to even capture the excitement of a ""Flashdance,"" a glossy construction-worker-cum-dancer feature-length music video that moved to a beat and never bored. The music herein is forgettable at best, and the dancing owes more to Las Vegas posturing than Broadway or discotheques. Perhaps Soderbergh was the wrong director for the project, which was an odd choice for the man who made ""Traffic"" and ""Erin Brockovich."" Magic Mike's story is unexpectedly downbeat, and the angst of a frustrated furniture designer is low on entertainment value. While the film will likely draw and disappoint gay and female audiences, perhaps men can relate most to Mike and his checkered career in pursuit of a dream However, few straight men will venture into a movie with the advertising and subject matter of ""Magic Mike.""",Magic Mike

65,cultfilmfan,Magic Mike,5,18 July 2012,"First off in this review, let me explain why I decided to go to see a film about male strippers, despite being a male and having no interest in the thing whatsoever. I went to see the film because it was directed by Steven Soderbergh, who over the years has made some very good films and his 2011 film Contagion, was one of my favourite films of last year. Unfortunately, I can't say the same thing about Magic Mike. When the film first started showing a retro looking Warner Bros film logo, I thought that this may be a type of period piece film that might be stylish and edgy. The first few minutes looked like the film could possibly go somewhere, but unfortunately it did not. A lot of the film focuses on several minute long segments of these young male strippers on stage doing elaborate dancing and strip teases that left me feeling both uncomfortable and bored very quickly. I think the audience of women that I was in probably appreciated those scenes a lot more than I did, but to me they went on for too long and made me feel dirty watching it and like as soon as I left the movie theater I needed to have a shower to clean myself of the filth I just watched and it almost felt contagious. Apparently the film is based on star and producer Channing Tatum's own experiences stripping, but that adds little value, or no interest to the film whatsoever either. The scenes in the strip club with these choreographed dance scenes were done in a very campy way, which I am sure to some people would be both amusing and maybe even a turn on, but for me, as I said it just left me feeling dirty and uncomfortable. One of the problems of the film was that it was very campy and over the top in these scenes and almost comical in a bad movie type of way and then when all the characters are outside of the strip club, the film actually tries to give us a story and even a bit of a morality tale and plays it as seriously as it can. Unfortunately, the attempt failed. Some filmmakers and screenwriters can successfully blend campiness and serious drama, but here it just does not work. You go from one scene to these strippers doing these over the top dance routine and then the film tries to teach us about morals and values and even put a bit of a love story in there, but it does not work because everything else in the film feels so over the top, artificial and corny that when it attempts to do something serious, it just does not work and just makes it look very awkward and out of place as well as the actors who are doing the scenes as well. The one thing I do have to credit this film for is it's great lighting and cinematography which almost reminded me a bit of The Social Network, but this film did not have the dark atmosphere or feeling that The Social Network so successfully worked upon the audience. Nevertheless, Magic Mike is a very good looking film, but unfortunately I can't compliment anything, or anyone else in front of, or behind the camera. What, I was really hoping was that Magic Mike, would be something like Paul Thomas Anderson's 1997 masterpiece about the porn industry , Boogie Nights. Boogie Nights was extremely well made and holds up extremely well still and would still rank as one of my favourite films. There they successfully blended scenes about an adult profession, but made it interesting and entertaining and also successfully managed to blend a human interest story as well that actually works and where we can care and feel something for the characters. We do not have that in Magic Mike. Instead we have a flashy movie that I quickly forgot after I saw it. I hope after this, Soderbergh rethinks his next project and does not go for the supposed Magic Mike sequel. The women in the audience seemed to really love this film, so I guess this is a film for them, but for me it did not work and it was an exercise in tediousness and boredom and I would have to call it one of the worst films of the year so far. Too bad because it had the potential and talent to be a good film, but the end project was a dud that could not be resurrected.",Magic Mike
66,Quietb-1,No magic here.,1,4 July 2012,"A good poster, and an effective trailer, make excellent marketing tools for a truly awful movie.Anything good is in the trailer. The only scenes that are the slightest bit interesting are on stage in the club. The rest of the time it's actors spouting bad dialogue with little or nothing to do. Classic lines like ""Hey"" and ""Hey do you want to get something to eat?"". They walk and talk. They sit and talk. They drink and talk. They stare toward the right or left or look at the ocean like it's supposed to mean something.Some of the original music is interesting and fits. The film has a golden tone appearance to the scenes outside of the club which becomes distracting and adds nothing. There's a scene after the sorority fight scene that seems out of place before the confrontation in the club. There is no reason to like the thinly drawn characters, and even less reason to like the movie. It's too long, often boring and feels like it is yet to be written. Steven Soderbergh is tied for the most overrated director of this generation.Don't waste your time, money, or eyes on this one.",Magic Mike
67,deatman9,Just terrible!!,2,22 June 2012,I was fortunate enough or maybe I should say unfortuante enough to see an advanced screening of this film last night in Seattle.This movie has really nothing going for it. The acting is terrible Channing Tatum and Mathew Mchonaugy are a pair of the worst acting in Hollywood. The story line is cliché and predictable and not enetertaining in the slightest.When this movie finally does come out in the cinema please heed my warning and don't waste the money. If your a 14 year old girl and your reading this by any chance got takea group of your friends to see this you will probably love it.,Magic Mike
68,Christian_Dimartino,It's a nice try.,6,24 July 2012,"Steven Soderbergh has said that he is going to retire soon, so I've noticed that lately he's trying to do whatever genre he can get ahold of. But I was not prepared for his latest movie, Magic Mike. I wasn't really looking forward to it. I am an open minded person, but it looked serious from the trailer. I was hoping that it would be more of a Full Monty kind of movie than a serious one. Luckily, it's a bit of both.Channing Tatum plays the title role. There's not a whole lot of story here. He's the big star of a male strip joint in Tampa. The club is run by a wild party animal named Dallas, who is played none other than Matthew McConaghay. Mike soon meets Adam(Alex Pettyfer), a young dude, and brings him into his stripper world.There's more to the plot than that, but I don't want to be the guy who spoils everything. Tatum is a talented man. He can act, he's funny, and he can dance, even if a lot of it consists of dry humping women in the face. The acting is good, especially from Cody Horn, who plays Adam's sister. But a lot of the characters are sort of pointless, must there to be there I guess.What I like about Magic Mike is that it pokes fun at its topic at hand, like Boogie Nights. But I cannot put this anywhere near that movie. Magic Mike certainly isn't boring, but it's missing a story, a good ending, and some character development. Women, bring your vibrators, you're in for a good time. Men, well, it's up in the air.B-",Magic Mike
69,cardsrock,Check your preconceptions at the door,8,6 January 2021,"There is a real film here, contrary to many biased reviewers. A well-told story and assured direction push Magic Mike beyond the stigma it has received. Channing Tatum is a good actor and I won't hear anything to the contrary. He has a real knack for acting casually cool in his roles and his dancing is genuinely impressive. McConaughey also gives a tremendous performance and fully commits to the role. If you're willing to look past the premise, you can find an actually enjoyable film here.",Magic Mike
70,vampyrecowboy,Not the way real dancers are.,4,18 September 2012,"I was a stripper. Yes, I was. I was fairly good too.This film however doesn't capture the reality behind the stage, on-stage or even the crowd.The reality is that the male dancers - or even female dancers aren't all friends...they are greedy, selfish ego tripping characters who look forward only to the dollars. They fight backstage, they get drunk back stage and they do serious amounts of coke back stage.Most male dancers are also gay. I am not and for that reason, the few men that are not gay will be reading ""picture books"" behind the curtain to ensure that they are ""up"" to the challenge when they are on stage.The gay men will be taking care of each other respectively before they go on stage.Most female crowds are mostly fat, overweight women who are nearing 50 and are there to get totally drunk. Male dancers will go to the table for them and pull everything off, but will not take them on-stage and perform nasty acts - clothed or unclothed.Also - we didn't have groups of 5 or 6 go up on-stage and perform a routine set. With people travelling all the time and new people coming in and out, we barely knew who each other was from a daily basis.Nobody fraternized with the bar-staff after closing...everybody was tired, stressed or too stoned to do anything. The bar-staff closed up and everybody got kicked out.If anybody tried to do a back-flip on-stage, they would have been fired or told not to do that again...because of liability and safety and insurance reasons.We made our money doing lap dances...not having a hundred girls throw money in our underwear on-stage.The back room dressing areas were always slightly better than a warehouse - filled with all sorts of bar crap...regardless of the bar or location.Anybody under the legal limit would never be allowed on-stage. There was always vice to make sure.There was always so much tension in the dressing room...because we were competing for the same money, that more than the mere basic communication between dancers never existed.This is a film based on the male stripper occupation, but misses out on the reality of it.It's also over drawn for plot. So much could be edited out and would not make a difference to the story.I was looking forward to see this, and I finally did. Wow...too long to watch a movie to see next to nothing of interest.",Magic Mike
71,Laakbaar,C'mon,7,28 December 2014,"I like male strippers just as much as the next guy. If the voting were based purely on male eye candy and Florida scenery, this movie would get 9 out of 10. Just the scene where Pettyfer shakes his booty in front of the mirror for the first time was worth the price of admission. The sandbar party was also cool. I want to do that.But I mean, c'mon, a film about male strippers without any erections? All I saw was a fleeting image of one in a pump. Did you even catch that? I understand that in America it's more acceptable to show an exploding head than an erection, but surely this movie would have been an exception. You simply can't portray the full impact of male stripping on an audience without the hard-ons. It's an integral and essential aspect. And the foursome scene -- does this still need to be implied? It's a movie about easy sexuality without any easy sexuality. This movie raises a number of issues for me about artistic honesty and freedom of expression.I'm not sure we got a realistic portrayal of the psychology and lifestyle of the strippers, even though clearly this was expressly the movie's aim. These fellas were portrayed as all-American boys just having fun. It's not like that, I'm sure. Where were the hours in the gym, the narcissism, the pharmaceutical aids, the whoring, the brutal attrition rate, the desperate search for money, the Darwinian fight for the good clients, the social disapproval. It was just blue-collar heroes, men dancing and recreational drugs, from what I could see. Was this movie an adolescent fantasy about easy sex, easy money and easy work?This movie shows us this world and these people, but was visibly searching for a story to tell. Adam does not really face much of a trial. The relationship between the sister and Mike was telegraphed from the very beginning. There were other things going on in the movie, but I forget what they were.",Magic Mike
72,davidgee,Bump and grind,4,18 July 2012,"Wow, the crappiest movie of the year (so far)! Hard to believe this is from the director of ERIN BROKOVICH and TRAFFIC and CHE.Channing Tatum kind of looks as if he was assembled from 'off-cuts' of Mark Wahlberg and Tommy Lee Jones. What little plot the film has concerns Magic Mike's 'mentoring' of new-stripper-on-the-block Adam (Alex Pettyfer - yes, girls, it's Alex Rider in just his Calvins!). Mike falls for Adam's sister Brooke (Cody Horne), who's not happy with her brother's new career move. There's a lot of male bonding and manly hugs but a disappointing lack of homo-erotic subtext which might have given the film an extra 'bite' (poison at the box-office perhaps?).Best seen as a companion piece to Paul Verhoeven's lamentable SHOWGIRLS, this is something Mr Soderbergh may want to edit from its CV. Watching Channing Tatum, Alex Pettyfer, Matthew McConaughey and hunks out of CSI Miami and TRUE BLOOD bump and grind in butt-clenching thongs is clearly a bit of a turn-on for the ladies, but this is a film which manages simultaneously to go too far and not far enough!",Magic Mike
73,osj2507,Mostly for the chicks,6,12 January 2016,"I actually like dancing films and Channing Tatum is lead in one of the first ""newer"" ones of the sort, Step Up and it was fun to see at that point that you could mix beats and classical with ballet and hip hop.I have been wanting to see this and then again maybe not so much, I thought it would be a fun film with a lot of references and jokes to the male stripper parts, but also with some great dance moves and just entertainment and then on the other side male strippers are for chicks most, so...I did like the film, it had a lot of fun things, for one the characters are all weird and flawed and having issues, but they are fun and say and do stupid, strange and crazy stuff like everybody would. But it is mostly for the chicks, if you do not see this film for the stripping parts, the naked male bodies, pumped up and in the spotlight on the dancing scene well then there is not that much else to see it for. The story is okay, classic romance for many parts, some rivalry, some chivalry and somebody gets hurt and so on and so forth, but it is average life displayed in different surroundings.See it for the dancing parts, see it for the romantic comedy it is, have fun and don't expect too much other then being entertained.",Magic Mike

75,rooee,"Lust, Caution",6,16 July 2012,"Tampa, Florida. What plot there is concerns Mike (Channing Tatum), a wannabe custom furniture salesman, who works by day on a building site and by night at Xquisite, a small but relatively classy strip joint looking to Xpand to Miami. Mike recruits Adam (Alex Pettyfer), a hedonistic 19-year-old, and soon the two of them are attracting the kind of business that enables the club's manager, Dallas (Matthew McConaughey), to realise his ambitions. Meanwhile, Mike is taught a lesson in What's Really Important by Adam's sensible sister, Brooke (Cody Horn). Predictability ensues.There's no story to speak of beyond the overfamiliar cautionary tale of excess, although it is neatly framed across three generations of men, each a decade apart: the young buck (Adam); the 30-year-old would-be-entrepreneur at a crossroads (Mike); and, most interestingly, the veteran still craving more, apparently on the road to self-destruction, possibly orgasmic self-combustion (Dallas). There's little jealousy or conflict between the men to disrupt the constant homoerotic throb. In fact the film is reluctant to pour water on any loins. It's a paean to virility.Writer Reid Carolin and director Steven Soderbergh fail to get under the golden skin of any of the characters, perhaps out of fear that any time spent in contemplation might steal the vigour from the dance scenes. Better to treat the film as a purely physical experience. On this level the film is a chemical rush, way more haywire than Soderbergh's drab Haywire. Women and men attracted to men will adore the Adonises; heterosexual men should feel enervated and confident. (Those men who feel threatened should perhaps reflect on how idealised images of women have been making young girls feel for the past half-century.) Pettyfer is functional; Tatum (once a stripper) is comfortable and believable; but the real magic belongs to McConaughey, wired and wide-eyed like an addict, locked in a permanent pelvic thrust as if magnetically led by and toward lust. Because everyone is smug - even the supposedly earthy Brooke - you become acclimatised to the extent that any glimmers of humility or tearfulness or introspection come across as profound.Soderbergh has flitted between flying the flag for the beautiful elite and making intricate films with a liberal social conscience, and this fits firmly in the former camp. While it doesn't exist in the same unreal universe of the Ocean's films, Magic Mike is a film about life in an unreal world; at bottom (so to speak) an acknowledgement of the need for moderation, its conscience conservative.",Magic Mike
76,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,Way more magic involved than I had presumed,9,5 August 2012,"It really, really boggles my mind just how the brains of so many of you people work. 90% of the reviews on here are exactly the same ""the stripping was the ONLY good thing about the movie"". I couldn't disagree more.I went into the movie with basically no expectations. In my opinion, Soderbergh is completely hit or miss. He has classics like Sex, Lies, and Videotape and stinkers like The Girlfriend Experience. This is the only movie of his aside from Sex, Lies, and Videotape that I have truly loved through and through.I don't know what people are talking about criticizing the acting. This is one of the best roles I have seen Tatum pull. Matthew McConaughy is perfect as the head slime ball. The lead who plays ""The Kid"" or Adam is a completely believable representation of every guy who is in his shoes in the world. And the sister Brooke, while coming off as a little obnoxious with her grim stares around the beginning of the movie, had a tough role to play but she did it with flying colors as well - by the end of the film she becomes a quite endearing figure.The soundtrack was good. The camera work and editing was innovative. There were some really cool montage-esque segments towards the middle of the movie that actually worked really well and were pretty stylish. The cinematography during the dance sequences are especially vibing and impressive as well.People complain there is no plot or ending - I think these people must be lacking depth or lacking a brain in general. From the very start, the movie flowed very well, a slow and smooth grind into the world that we will end up spending the rest of it's length existing in. The movie maintains an impressive realism through the majority of it's scenes - instead of trying to feel like a blockbuster feature, it feels like what it would feel like in reality. The focus of the plot changes slightly throughout the film, but stays open and interesting. And the ending, I don't think could have been more perfect - if you take nothing from it, well, you must be missing a lot of things in life.I dunno what else to say! This is absolutely one of my favorite Soderbergh movies and easily one of the best movies I have seen this year in 2012 so far. I recommend it to anyone with brains.",Magic Mike

I took it for a few hours of chilling out after a long day at work. Honestly, most women in real life go for the type of characters shown in this movie. Bad boys who treat them like dirt, that is what they chase after. How romantic. I mean really, how earth shattering can a stripper be. Sadly,most of them are totally messed up and their whole life is filled with drama. I thought the movie was entertaining enough, but it is not a Brando movie. Regardless of what I or anyone thinks, this 7 million dollar film made over 160 million at the box office. So, it just goes to show you what people go for today. Magic Mike and company and Herman the pig get the last laugh. Clearly, Magic Mike should be renamed Money Mike.",Magic Mike
78,HelenMary,"The only thing Magic is Channing, the rest is like amateur hour",4,2 December 2012,"The buck stops with the Director in all chains of command in the film industry and Soderbergh should be had up for dereliction of duty. It should have had a point. It should at least, at least, have told a story with a beginning a middle and a... what happened to the end? This was a lot of badly-filmed nothing. Tatum did the best he could the with amateurish script(Carolin), he at least seemed to try to act and breathe some life and realism into it. The plot was ridiculous and paper-thin. The characters were so badly drawn as to be talking props, I didn't care one jot about them as they flitted in and out, the spotlights reflecting of their rock hard pecs and washboard stomachs. Ooooh perhaps that was what Soderbergh was trying to say... that we objectify these poor defenseless men and don't see them as real people! A-ha! Shame on the women. Boo. Hiss. Cody Horn, as the ?love interest? oh dear. Was she possibly reading the script over Tatum's shoulder the whole time? Dreadful. Scenes with her were often painful to watch, wooden and rather inhuman as no emotion seemed to pass across her face. I was intrigued by Joanna (Munn - The Newsroom). Actually it would have been good to see ANY of the characters develop past introduction level and just as random happenings which didn't add to the story. Oh and Adam (Pettyfer) was pointlessly stupid, oblivious and amoral, really... frustrating, but he did so in a really cavalier and not bothering to act kind of way. Again there was potential to develop the overly long film but nothing came of it. McConaughey was potentially the comic relief, but wasn't - there was no humour in this at all - but he came across as letchy, reptilian, narcissistic and I often saw him as predatory and just plain creepy. If this was darker or more tongue in cheek, it would have worked, there was potential for an art-house look with something gritty (My Own Private Idaho which stirred the consciousness) and dirty, or even if it was moralistic, SOMETHING, would have been good. The long silences didn't work like they do in Drive (Gosling), which has the polarity of the quiet against the violence, in this you supposed someone has lost their place in the script or someone had popped out for coffee during filming. This has nothing on which to hang it's hat. It was too long and overall was a mis-mash of styles, editing, poor lighting and sound, atrocious dubbing and it felt like it was just thrown together. Dialogue was unnatural, stilted and just plain naive.The saving grace (only one) of this film was Tatum's dancing (Step Up), and knowing that this is something he did before acting so at least that gave him some clout. The routines were pretty good, and seeing a CSI (Rodriguez) and a werewolf (Manganiello - TrueBlood) in the review was a giggle. Sad that Tatum didn't help produce a film project that had some... point, given his experience in this area.",Magic Mike
79,nickmesafilms,Magic Mike (2012) - It's Raining Men! (Don't Judge Me! I'm Still Straight!),7,22 September 2012,"Okay, right off the bat, you would know that a movie about male strippers would not be worth spending my money to see. But thanks to director Steven Soderbergh, and his gift of brining a new charm to a usual cliché story, ""Magic Mike"" is actually a surprising winner (Just go with me on this, because it's not weird! Not weird at all). ""Magic Mike"" stars Channing Tatum, whom in the past used to be a former male stripper, so that technically means that ""Magic Mike"" is actually based on his own true past events. He stars as the title character, a guy who works at this all-male strip club, and he then befriends a 39-year-old ""down on his luck"" outcast, and invites him to work at the strip club. Now, we have a story of male-stripping, drugs, dancing, and of course, the ladies! Now, the last thing that I would even think about doing was to watch ""Magic Mike"", so I was going to just leave this movie for the ladies. But, now that I see this movie, I turns out that this movie was better than I thought it would be. Again, just go along with me on this! Director Steven Soderbergh, a masterful filmmaker, makes it very clear that there's actually more story and characters, than there is male stripping. We actually get a deep look at the life of a male stripper, and actually understand how that affects that particular someone. While at the same time, keeping the audience entertained....while the women will just go to the movie just for the male-stripping! So far, this has been a pretty great year for Channing Tatum, delivering another great and improving performance in movie after movie. He's really the one who holds the entire movie together. Alex Pettyfer, Cody Horn, Matt Bomer, Olivia Munn, Joe Manganiello, and Matthew McConaughey round up the supporting cast, most of them delivering great performances. Some characters don't really carry a certain purpose, and they're probably there just to be in the movie. Cody Horn, especially, whom is just flat-out awful in every scene she was in. All she did was mimic Kristen Stewart by keeping a straight, angry look on her face, for the entire running time. She was just the weakest of the bunch, for me! But, Matthew McConaughey, once again, makes another great performance as the owner of the strip club, while taking a break from his usual type-casted performance, just like he did in his even-more excellent performance in ""Bernie"". Now, here come the flaws with this stripping showcase. Sometimes, the movie follows these subplots involving some particular characters, stuck in a few sticky situations of their own, but the movie just forgets about those elements, and the movie just leaves them unfinished and undeveloped. Also, I've heard a lot of rumors that this movie's pacing was too slow, but I believe that's a lie, because the movie seemed quick. But here's the problem, although I like it when a movie is quick, this movie felt ""too"" quick! I believed that Soderbergh must have rushed the movie way too much, even the ending felt a little rushed, leaving the movie with so many plot-holes. But, overall, even at it's flaws, ""Magic Mike"" was really that much of a surprise. Now, gentleman, just bare with me, because we are men, and we are proud. Great directing, great performances, and great style and tone, ""Magic Mike"" knows what it wants to be, even at it's more awkward moments (bet you know what I mean by that!). Okay, let's just get this review over with. I'm starting to feel weird just talking about a male-stripper movie!

Never knew that she played Hugh Jackman's daughter in Swordfish (2001). Also Kate Easton was good in a short supporting role.

81,PoisonKeyblade,"Beautiful directing, Beautiful men, Beautiful film",10,5 January 2013,"I had the great pleasure of catching the midnight show for Magic Mike, with an all-star cast including Channing Tatum, Alex Pettyfer, Matt Bomer, Matthew McConaughey, and Joe Manganiello. I absolutely adored the movie from start to finish, and even though it was about two hours long, I still wanted more!First thing's first: don't go in expecting nothing but stripping for two hours. Sure, Magic Mike is mainly about a group of strippers but it also intimately deals with the private lives of both Mike and Adam. It goes to darker places than I would have imagined and explores themes and ideas you wouldn't exactly expect from a stripper flick. I'm not trying to diminish any of the fun you will most likely have if you go to see Magic Mike this weekend, just adjust your expectations accordingly because the movie is equal parts drama and comedy.Essentially, the plot deals with Magic Mike, a stripper who works for Dallas, who takes a young kid under his wing (Adam). The more comfortable Adam gets with the stripping game, the more his world spins out of control. I absolutely loved the casting in this movie. Really though, whoever was in the casting department deserves an Oscar, because it's all perfect and brilliant. I couldn't have envisioned a better or more well-suited colorful cast of characters. While the minor characters (like Joe Manganiello's Big Dick Richie and Matt Bomer's Ken) aren't given a whole lot to do throughout the duration, they all still have shining little moments. I especially adored Bomer's swagger, which was pretty much unparalleled. Channing Tatum is absolutely epic in the movie, playing what is essentially an extension of himself and doing so quite well. McConaughey is also quite striking in what I'd consider to be a daring career move. I couldn't have imagined anyone else doing his role or performing it halfway as good as he does.Director Steven Soderbergh does an overly competent job as director here, serving up equal parts heart and epic sexy strip scenes. The music and every scene where shirts are shed are downright memorable, and may serve as great DVD extras if extended sequences are made available. I know I'd certainly watch a full-length movie of all the stripper performances.So, there is actually one small complaint that I had: the ending was way too abrupt. I'm all for ambiguity, but it seemed really sudden and somehow unfinished. Maybe it's just me being greedy and wanting a bit more specifics. I also kind of find Cody Horn quite annoying, but that is neither here nor there. If you have nothing better to do this weekend and you're in to sexy beefcake-y guys, definitely check out Magic Mike. I loved everything from the costumes to the sets to the camera-work to the absolutely brilliant casting. Can they make a sequel or spin-off that's at least an hour of male stripper dancing This movie is as close to the perfect fantasy flick you're going to get. The DVD had better have extended musical scenes because it really should; how many more DVD's would they sell that way? I must see this movie again, and as soon as possible! / Rating: A+",Magic Mike
82,yris2002,"A pleasure for the female eye, and nothing more",6,6 October 2012,"No doubt women will enjoy this movie more then men (there was only one man in the theater), and indeed there are truly enjoyable strips, with sculpted guys that common women rarely or probably never find in their routine lives. All the rest is an unaccomplished attempt to look beyond and behind this world of easy money, where depravity is the lowest point where one has necessarily to get to, forcing him to decide who to side with. All this mixed with romance, melodrama, predictable twists, but no real depth. Let's say I expected something more from Sodenbergh, but this was probably intended as a box office picture. The clean nature of Brooke, Adam's sister, a simple girl who still believes in the importance of limits in one's life, may give some sense to the picture, which maybe, from a very long distance, wanted to relate the economic crisis to the still living American dream (personified by Magic Mike),,,, But the bulk of the picture remains the impressive muscles of these macho men (to tell the truth,a very good interpretation is offered by Matthew McConaughey). This abundance is certainly worth the ticket, but cannot equal the real mix of entertainment, fun, and seriousness of a similar picture like ""The Full monty"".",Magic Mike
83,Chris_Pandolfi,"Tatum Bares His Past, Among Other Things",7,29 June 2012,"It's now fairly well known that, back when he was a broke nineteen-year- old just getting his start in showbiz, Channing Tatum worked as a male stripper at a Tampa, Florida nightclub. Rather than be ashamed of his past, he has channeled it into the production of ""Magic Mike,"" which is not a straight biopic so much as a fictional comedy/drama that uses Tatum's experiences as a springboard. He had wanted to make this film for several years, and in a 2010 interview with the ""Sydney Morning Herald,"" he told Donna Walker-Mitchell that he already had a director in mind: ""I'd like Nicolas Refn, who did the movie 'Bronson,' to do it because he's insane for it. It needs to be a crazy film and I think it's also possible to do a cute, romantic movie."" Although Steven Soderbergh ultimately helmed the project, Tatum still got his wish in that it's crazy and, to an extent, a cute, romantic movie.I admittedly know nothing about the backstage world of male stripping, or even female stripping, although I suspect the people behind this film have done an adequate job of dramatizing it. A lesser film wouldn't bother with the subtler details, such as the emasculating grooming rituals, the exhausting preshow workouts, and even the playful ribbing of the new guy. A lesser film might also have overplayed the darker aspects to the point of mindless melodrama. What we have here is a fairly well balanced cross between a character study, a behind-the- scenes drama, and a stage spectacle, the latter a surprising showcase of high production values. And then, of course, there's the sight of good- looking young men gyrating their bodies and stripping down to their G- strings. It should be noted that the audience I sat with was predominantly female, and strangely enough, they laughed more than they hooted and hollered.Tatum has been cast as the title character, a.k.a. Michael Lane, a thirty-year-old who works three nights a week at a Tampa strip club called Xquisite. During daylight hours, he gets by as a construction worker and a car detailer. One day, while installing Spanish tiles on the roof of a new building, he meets a handsome but naïve nineteen-year- old named Adam (Alex Pettyfer), whose temper cost him a football scholarship and who currently crashes on a couch in the home of his sister, Brooke (Cody Horn). Sensing an opportunity, Mike takes Adam to Xquisite and introduces him to the owner, Dallas (Matthew McConaughey), who immediately gives him a job as a prop handler. Stripping was initially never part of the deal for Adam. But then, when one of the scheduled acts fails to begin, he's hurriedly pushed onstage and told to do something. The best he can offer is a shy boy act, awkwardly stripping down to his boxers without doing a dance.Half of the film involves Adam being seduced into the world of show business with promises of money, women, and partying. He's appealed to by Dallas, who not only teaches him some basic choreography but also allows him to keep all the money women stuff into his underwear. But as the film progresses, he becomes increasingly exposed to dangerous situations and shady characters. One is Xquisite's DJ (Gabriel Iglesias), who ropes him into the world of drugs, both as a pusher and as a user. When a private dance at a sorority house goes wrong, he loses $10,000 worth of ecstasy and finds he has no way to pay of his supplier. He will eventually be found lying next to a pool of his own vomit, which is being eaten by the pet piglet of the woman he slept with.The other half involves Mike's personal life, which he tries but repeatedly fails at keeping separate from his professional life. His attempts at forming a relationship with a post-grad psychology student (Olivia Munn) go nowhere, given the fact that she sees him as nothing apart from a pretty face. Because he has assigned himself as Adam's mentor, he will inevitably become more attached to Brooke, who isn't domineering but is understandably concerned for her brother's well being. Although their relationship goes pretty much where we expect it to go, it is fascinating to watch a detached professional try his hand at genuine human feelings. We will also learn about Mike's dream of starting a custom furniture business; in a surprisingly relevant scene, he discovers that banks are less than accommodating to clients with plenty of cash but rotten credit scores.All the actors give decent performances, but the real standout is McConaughey, who maintains a difficult balance between devilish charm and sly opportunist. The latter is becomes apparent in the later stages of the film, at which point he announces that Xquisite will be moving to Miami, a more prominent and more financially secure location. His character is most engaging when he's onstage announcing the dancing acts; he has become an expert at gauging audiences, and with a combination of subtle expressions, select words, and overt obscene gestures, he can thoroughly whip his customers into a frenzy. For some, mere spectacle will be the appeal of ""Magic Mike."" For others, it will have more to do with subtext, especially when apparent in scenes like those with McConaughey.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",Magic Mike
84,squirrel_burst,Not just for the ladies,8,28 October 2014,"The best way to see ""Magic Mike"" is with a room full of people ready to enjoy themselves and ready to scream and holler at the screen. The louder the crowd, the better. I actually found that considering how raunchy the subject is, the film was surprisingly tame, so if you're avoiding it because you can't stand male nudity, there isn't any here. There are plenty of shirtless men and a few behinds for the ladies and some topless women for the guys though, so there's something for everyone. I feel like because we haven't really seen that many movies about male strippers, unless they were comedies, it didn't go nearly as far as it could have and it leaves plenty to mine for future films about the same subject. It has some nice dramatic elements in the second and final thirds of the film, showing that there are plenty of tough stories to be said about this subject on top of the comedic ones. It has a lot of laughs and some genuinely touching moments, the characters are interesting, the performances are good, the dance numbers are a lot of fun and they vary quite a bit, so it doesn't feel repetitive at all. It's a crow-pleaser, although it does run a little long. Some trimming of the subplots might have been nice, but it's still an enjoyable romp.

85,Ryan_MYeah,Strictly a guilty pleasure that rarely flirts with greatness.,6,13 December 2012,"Master of versatility or not, Steven Soderbergh's recent output has not been very impressive, and while Magic Mike is a step up, it's only a gradual step, and was seriously one of the most awkward viewing experiences of my life. His cast is almost uniformly strong. Channing Tatum has never been better, and he has a good showcase to show off his slick dance moves. Alex Pettyfer shares some good chemistry with him. Of any of the cast, none outshine Matthew McConaughey, who has been having a banner year. I'll confess that I was never a fan of his before, but this energetic, witty, scene-stealing performance of his made me a fan. As for Soderbergh's direction, he handles it with his usual stylistic flourishes, and paces it very well. However, not everything works. The comedic and dramatic aspects don't mesh together quite as well as I think they ought to be. That, and actress Cody Horn is just terrible. It's a clever little viewing experience, but one that could use some serious tinkering.*** / *****",Magic Mike

88,tnrcooper,Steven Soderbergh's take on the boy-meets-girl movie,8,15 August 2013,"Against the backdrop of a male revue in Tampa, Steven Soderbergh has written a boy-meets- girl movie. Take away the parties, the well-choreographed male strip scenes, Matthew McConaughey chewing up scenery, and the notion of a roofer designing furniture while twilighting as a male stripper and this is the story of what Mike (Channing Tatum) values. Soderbergh has taken a very unconventional setting and overlaid it with characters seeking to find their way in modern America, trying to decide amongst love and money, amongst honesty and dishonesty. I thought it got a little bit precious about 3/4 of the way through as the men lose their bearings amidst the wealth, women, and drugs that their hard work afforded them but in truth I think their comeuppance was realistic and it led to a satisfying conclusion.Good work from Channing Tatum as a decent, hard-working guy really struggling to do the right thing. Matthew McConaughey is deep in good-old-boy-as-sex-god mode and his scenes are a lot of fun. I thought newcomer Pettyfer as the Kid was a bit bland but that Cody Horn as Mike's love interest struck the right mixture of romantic interest in Mike and slight judgmentalism about his choice to be a stripper. Anyway, if you like Soderbergh, this shows again that he likes to approach film differently from most mainstream directors working. He has explored a world that is unknown to most of us, created some very well-rounded and unique characters, and given us a fair ending.",Magic Mike

91,mistoppi,"I liked it, yet it seems a bit hollow",6,23 August 2016,"I'm surprised how many people talking about this movie (and I mean talking it about casually. I haven't exactly read any other reviews or blog posts) leave out how good the story is. From what people have said I've just assumed it's a cute male stripper story, but there was a lot of depth left out. Sure, not all characters are deep and have a big reason for why they are stripping apart from money, but at least it's explained why the main character wants the money. It was interesting to see that Mike actually wanted to do something else because I didn't think that was the case at first.The story is an excellent drama with a lot of ups and downs both in the story and the writing itself. The whole idea is quite good, and it's interesting to see what is going to happen, bu a lot of the characters are left blank. Does the audience care about anyone else than Mike and maybe a little about Adam? It's like Channing Tatum is the only one giving life to this movie, and all the other actors are mere accessories. Without Tatum this movie would feel even more hollow. Visually this movie is amazing, and I'm not just talking about the cast. I mean the choreographic used in the dance numbers is excellent, and the colour scheme is extremely nice. I enjoyed this movie quite a lot, yet I have hard time figuring out why exactly. The story is good but not great, and that goes for many things in this movie, like the soundtrack, cinematography, etc. But I'd feel a bit horrible to say that the only thing that kept me interesting was all the hot men, because that wouldn't be true. I think it's Channing Tatum who makes this movie enjoyable - he's charming, funny and easy on the eye, and a lot better at acting than people say he is. He seems like an absolute sweetheart.",Magic Mike
92,troy-manatunga,I see no reason to hate this movie!,6,30 December 2012,"Co-financed by Steven Soderbergh and Channing Tatum, MAGIC MIKE is a comedy/drama/biography scripted by Reid Carolin. As the mass media speculates the concept within the creation of MAGIC MIKE is based on the early life of Channing Tatum himself who was a male stripper in his late teens. Whilst this project is proposed and initiated by Tatum himself, the motion picture on its whole is fictional however certain parallels at certain intervals could be drawn with the STEP UP stars past life.Rated R this picture most certainly isn't for a general audience. Whilst it is a thoroughly enjoyable movie to the mature audience the themes discussed maybe frowned upon in certain cultures. As an enthusiast of the motion picture the reason behind my choice to write a positive review on this title is based on a deeper interpretation of the theme that spoke to me.(The misconception and scrutiny of individuals that is based on profession.) However that isn't the area of focus instead this critic will bring to light Soderbergh's success in this biography.Mike (Tatum) is an entrepreneur as he claims himself to be and is a jack of many trades and king of none. Mike also on the other hand has been a male stripper for a span of over 6 years trying to save money on the side whilst having a good time in order to someday bring to reality his dream of running a business. Adam (Alex Pettyfer) is a 19 year old boy who has just lost his football scholarship to college owing to an altercation with the coach on the very first day at practice. Adam who is on the hunt for jobs is hired to work at a construction site that Mike himself is employed. Adam manages to get fired on the first day from this job as well. Mike who takes a liking to the kid gives him a ride home. The friendship builds into a closer bond and Mike introduces Adam into the world of male stripping at the Xquisite strip club owned by Dallas (Matthew McConaughey). Although a stripper by night Mike's motives are professional. However the young teen is absorbed into the darker and gloomier corruption that lurks around night life professions. Soderbergh narrates us a story from both Paradigms mixing it up with moments of laughter and emotion and as usual a famous open ended Soderbergh ending.I am not certain how many readers would agree with me on this next statement. If you watch closely all Soderbergh movies have an ending that is open ended and could be whatever the viewer wanted it to be. MAGIC MIKE is no different. Whilst Soderbergh failed to impress with CONTAGION and HAYWIRE he seems to have got it right with MAGIC MIKE. For starters his entire cast isn't Hollywood royalty. This is a good change since the OCEANS franchise that play of his has always failed. Tatum and Pettyfer are amazing and daringly convincing in what they do. The man of the hour is none other than the Lincoln Lawyer himself; Matthew McConaughey. This man on his own is the center mast of the sail that is MAGIC MIKE. Everyone else leans onto him for support and ricochets on his presence catapulting the movie forward. Soderbergh has never really worked on movies that discuss the themes of puppy love that is evident in MAGIC MIKE. As anticipated a royal mockery is made of all scenes that include the little love tussle between Mike and Brooke (Cody Hor). If one can turn a blind eye to that, then MAGIC MIKE is a home run that is much deserved by the cast and crew.Do not be misguided by Tatum's and McConaughey presence and expect this to be the farce that was 21JUMPSTREET. Instead this a near match biography of Tatum said in the most simplest of manners whilst capturing a great element of positive entertainment.TITLE: MAGIC MIKE DIRECTED BY: STEVEM SODERBERGH STARRING: MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY and ALEX PETTYFER RATED: R RATING:06/10 RUNTIME: 110 MINUTES",Magic Mike
93,Jonathon_Natsis,"Despite its flaws, it's 'alright, alright, alright.'",6,25 December 2012,"During the day, Mike is just your average rich, beautiful individual, but at night he'swell, the same guy, minus the clothes. Magic Mike tells the story of Tatum's lead performer, a young upstart he takes under his wing (Alex Pettyfer) and the perils of excess that come with instantaneous fame.The film is not without class, but its positives are too minute to cover its flaws. Tatum is strong as the titular fun loving bro- hemian, even if his characterisation as a battler hoping to self-fund his custom furniture business is difficult to believe, considering he lives in a swanky beachside apartment and gets around in a spanking new F-150. Matthew McConaughey milks every drop out of his role of eccentric club promoter Dallas the way only he can: gratuitously shirtless and displaying more ham than a Christmas lunch. And for all their cheese, the dance performances are choreographed impressively; accompanied by the sharp, glistening cinematography director Steven Soderbergh (Ocean's Eleven, Contagion) has so often taken to the bank.Magic Mike is not let down by its whole so much as by the sum of its parts. Many of the film's quirky traits grow tired quickly, including, but not limited to, an omnipresent yellow tinge that makes all external scenes look like a fifteen-year-olds Instagram profile and the presentation of stripping as some sort of enviable life path, contrary to its typical bottom-rung-of-society connotations in real life. The second half's descent into a tale cautioning against the perils of the good life does not resonate nearly as well as contemporary 'rise-and-fall' classics like Goodfellas and Boogie Nights and, as a result, what could have been the film's point of difference drags it into forgettable and predictable territory. Special features include extended sequences of two dance scenes and a seventeen-minute mega compilation of all the film's strip sequences.

94,TheFilmGuy1,More Drama Than Stripping (Thank God),7,27 December 2014,"I have a feeling a lot of people disliked this because it actually isn't just 2 hours of Channing Tatum and other hot guys stripping. But for me, a straight male, I was glad it wasn't. I was also glad because it was a pleasant surprise. Magic Mike is a glimpse into the world of male stripping, and it doesn't try to hide anything. It's a tale of a a master finding his apprentice, showing him the ropes, but not realizing the kind of world he is exposing him to. A glamour filled yet dark and depressing lifestyle. Yeah that young guys are making the money and getting the girls, but you see the opposite of that in the oldest stripper, Tarzan. He's worn down and can't hold his own, but is still stripping. It's a sad life.Channing Tatum does a really good job. He's someone who I thought was really crappy at first, but he's come into his own in the world of acting. He can do serious and comedic roles, and he has to do both here, and he does it well! Alex Pettyfer plays the kid that Tatum takes under his wing, and he portrays the young and aimless rookie pretty well, and his eventual transformation works. The back and forth between Pettyfer and Tatum is good, especially considering that I read they didn't get along on set. Sadly I thought Cody Horn was a bit weak at times. She is supposed to be Tatums love interest and Pettyfers sister, but she is kind of emotionless. It's hard to tell if shes mad, sad, happy, sarcastic or what the hell shes trying to do. It's kind of weird and brings the film down.I liked the story that was being told. It's a behind the scenes look at a profession and lifestyle I know nothing about. It's consistently interesting, and even the actual stripping scenes work and aren't gratuitous, because you need to see what they do on stage to understand them more. You can't have the film without the stripping. It's interestingly shot as well, with that Steven Soderbergh style that a lot of his films that he has directed has. Yellowish coloring outdoors and lots of color inside the strip club. There's also some great use of lighting during a scene towards the end that I won't spoil. It's well done.I enjoyed Magic Mike more than I thought I would. It had more depth than expected, and I appreciated that. Although i'm sure the sequel being made, Magic Mike XXL will be less character drama and more shirtless Channing Tatum, since Soderbergh isn't directing it. Talk about missing the point.",Magic Mike
95,jaxbubba,Call it what is is....soft-core PORN!!!,2,29 July 2012,"In a word, this film is ""bad""; in two words it's ""really bad"". For the life of me I do not know how Channing Tatum makes a living at acting???? THE BOY CAN NOT ACT!!!! However, if the dance sequences were really him, the boy can dance I do have to give him that!!! But since most of his dance sequences featured him in a hat which covered/hid his face, I would have to question that as well.The storyline follows the life of ""The Kid"" played by Alex Pettyfer, someone that has absolutely nothing going for himself. He's recently dropped out of college, lost a construction job, lost a T-Mobile job, and as the movie begins is planning to spend the rest of his life on his sister's couch. One night out, he runs into Channing Tatum (Magic Mike) and as the circumstances of the night unfold, they end up at Mike's place of employment, a male strip club in which Mike headlines. ""The Kid"" quickly becomes infatuated with lifestyle of easy money, easier girls, lots of sex, and free-flowing drugs.The problem with the film is that you really do not care for any of the characters in this film. The film actually becomes is a soft-core male-romp of numerous strip routines as the male cast bumps and grinds its way through this 100 minute film. The Alex ""The Kid"" character has no redeeming qualities, and at the end of the film has learned nothing from incidents which have occurred throughout the film. Of course he plays the role of the 19 year old teen perfectly, and is really only concerned where his next piece of ass is coming from so I will give him that!! (Well Played!!) The Channing Tatum ""Magic Mike"" character is a hodge-podge wannabe something else; however, what that is, the audience doesn't have a clue!!! Is he an entrepreneur, a carpenter, a stripper, a nice guy? Who knows? However, by far the worse character on screen has to be Matthew McConaughey's ""Dallas"" character, he just plain creepy. Dallas is the club owner/club emcee, and he is so way past his prime, he really looks absolutely disgusting up on the stage. Do not get me wrong, he has a great body and everything; however, on stage, as a stripper, just looked ""not right"" like that guy at the playground who doesn't have kids ""not right"".So the movie was made to only $7 million dollars, and you can really see the cheapness!!! However, it has made a butt-load (get it) of money, because it's like porn people are not paying to see this film for great acting, a great plot line, or character development they want skin, and butt-jiggling, and tear-a-way pants and LADIES, I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THERE IS PLENTY OF THAT UP ON THE SCREEN. I cannot recommend this film; however, when to go see this film and/or buy the DVD, I can assure you that you will get exactly what you are wanting to see!!! So enjoy!!

97,dharmendrasingh,One for the ladies (and gentlemen),6,29 July 2012,"The usherette tittered when I bought my ticket. 'Why do you laugh?' I asked. 'Because only girls are watching this'. Clearly this is someone who doesn't believe in the universality of cinema. Yes, Steven Soderbergh's latest features male strippers, and yes it will appeal more to a certain demographic, but so will every film. Audiences may be disparate but films are androgynous. Or should be. As 'Magic' Mike, charming Channing Tatum naturally gets top billing, but the film revolves around Adam (rising star Alex Pettyfer). Adam is a congenital loser, the kind of guy who refuses to wear a tie and wonders why he can't sustain a job. He lives with his sister, Brooke (Cody Horn), whose acting conveys a suspicion of men, presumably because she has only her wayward brother as a yardstick. Adam finds work on a construction site with Mike, who sees the desperation of Adam's situation and entices him to join his exotic dancing troupe, Xquisite, led by Dallas (Matthew McConaughey). Dallas astutely exploits Adam's naivety by branding him 'The Kid', an amateurish, sloppy act, which the ladies love. The next three months are a non-stop orgy of girls, booze and drugs: everything a man like Adam could wish for. This lifestyle has lost its appeal for Mike, now 30, who only took up professional undressing to become a bespoke furniture salesman. He no longer wishes to hold out for the phantom 10% of the business Dallas keeps promising him, but poor credit keeps him on the pole. (Tatum again stars in a role which brings out his effortless charisma and sweetness.)McConaughey recently impressed me in William Friedkin's 'Killer Joe', and now this film has completely changed my mind about him. He's gone from my dud to my stud list in just two films. And Pettyfer works because he doesn't work, if you see what I mean. Although an ex-model, he's not 'stripper material' (not that I'd know much about that sort of thing), yet there's a naturalness to his acting, which works. Although not in the same league as some of Soderbergh's other titles (notably 'Traffic' and 'Out of Sight'), there's enough going on to warrant a viewing. Characters are well written, lives intersect in an unforced manner, motivations are believable. There's plenty of saucy (and quite impressive) dancing to keep the majority of this film's audience happy, but there's also a decent story for those who aren't watching exclusively for nudity. www.moseleyb13.com",Magic Mike
98,JimmyCollins,"Step Up meets Showgirls, a fun movie for a girls night out.",6,25 August 2012,"Obviously the main attraction of Magic Mike is the wonderful cast and their bodies displayed for the viewer to enjoy, and it certainly delivers in that aspect, however with that aside, there is very little to Magic Mike, but in all honesty people aren't going to see this movie for the plot, they're going to see the buff boys strut their stuff. Channing Tatum is one hell of a guy, he is basically in every scene and he does a fantastic job, I never really liked or disliked him before seeing this but I now have a new found love for him, yes he is pretty much playing himself in this movie but he still delivers a wonderful performance.The rest of the cast are great too, mostly, Matt Bomer is extremely dreamy and Matthew McConaughey pretty much steals every scene he is in, he along with Channing and the stripping is one of the greatest things about this film, he's hysterical. The gals take a back seat in Magic Mike, newcomers Olivia Munn and Cody Horn are OK, but their characters don't really do anything amazing that stands out, but I'm sure both will probably do something more interesting in the future. The dance scenes are exceptional, so much detail has gone into the choreography, it's like watching a dance movie with an all male cast, and all the guys have got the moves down perfectly.The only down side to the movie is the length, it ended abruptly, I was shocked when it ended, I thought there was going to be another scene, and also it seemed as though parts of the movie were done very cheaply, obviously the budget was more dedicated to certain parts of the movie more so than others, and finally the casting of Alex Pettyfer, my least favorite of all the cast, it's kind of embarrassing that he is acting along side people who are far more professional and talented than he, but oh well.Just go see it and enjoy it for what it is, a sweaty, sexy, hunk fest. Matt Bomer in a thong is worth the ticket price, hooray. :)",Magic Mike
99,mbs,"OK enough movie, no more no less--the stripping scenes pop with life, but the rest is dull filler",5,16 July 2012,"Soderbourgh's made a movie that really seems to get the joy of stripping. The scenes that are the movie's reason for being I have to admit are very well shot, well lit, well choreographed, and really get at the joy and pure giddiness that both the guys feel performing and the joy that the women in the audience feel watching them. They're the centerpieces of the film, and the film whatever else you may or may not feel about Channing Tatum's character or the rather vacuous supporting characters orbiting him---those scenes really pop and bring the movie to life. Its unfortunate that everything that's in between those scenes feels like so much filler meant to beef up the film's dramatic quotient so that its not just seen as that dude stripper movie. (Not unlike how Soderbourgh's previous film ""Haywire"" also only really came to life during the various action scenes of its main character springing to life and doing the real fighting scenes that were that movie's reason for being made and how everything else there was also filler--albeit somewhat more entertaining filler) I appreciate the efforts that have been taken to make Tatum seem like a three dimensional character with desires to make something of his life that he just can't because of--well various reasons actually (bad credit, not being taken seriously, etc)--none the least is that he can't seem to make up his mind about whether to grow up and pursue a serious adult relationship with an actual woman or continue playing friends with benefits with Olivia Munn's rather fickle and pretty arbitrary character. (or something like that i guess) Tatum like the movie itself is all right---i don't think this is a particularly revelatory performance the way some of the professional reviewers are talking about---he's definitely not John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever here even if their situations and circumstances are similar. (You will not for one second get me to believe that he has even half of Travolta's charisma in that movie here, even if he has the dance moves....frankly Tatum was more Travolta level charismatic in 21 Jump Street.) However Tatum definitely handles the very good monologue Soderbourgh throws at him in the last 20 minutes or so perfectly--and the disillusion that he feels as the movie goes along is believable--although the ending is really pretty inconclusive--its almost as if they didn't wanna end it because they knew a sequel would be imminent--but i don't think there's really any more story to tell here quite honestly. I mean Tatum's character reaches the decision that he makes and then what's left for him or the movie to do except repeat itself with stuff we've already seen? I suppose the sequel could focus entirely on Matthew McConaghey's character or Alex Pettifer's character but neither is really all that fleshed out (no pun intended) to the point that either one could be the main character in their own movie. (although at least McConaghey has a character that could hold your attention with his non-stop patter and admittedly that patter is pretty funny at times.) There's enough in the in between filler scenes that i kinda wish they were better written, or at least better thought out, and not so low key--i understand there was probably an effort to keep all of the non-stripping scenes low energy so to highlight the difference between their club life and their real everyday life--but it just adds to the whole non-club scenes being filler vibe that the film is only too happy to accept. The film isn't bad, its never less than watchable--but really the only time the movie even approaches the level of those stripper scenes is when you see the dancers rehearsing their moves--and not because of the dancing--its just because that seems to be the only other time the movie's energy level actually perks up and manages to even be funny as well, would that the other scenes had as much humor, or any emotion expressed besides Tatum's slightly depressed brooding.",Magic Mike
100,tbmforclasstsar,"much deeper than its surface implies, Magic Mike delivers genuine substance in addition to its sexually appealing main attraction",7,1 July 2012,"When Channing Tatum shared with Steven Soderbergh the story of his eight-month stint as an exotic dancer when he was just 19-years old, inspiration struck. A Reid Carolin screenplay, a ridiculously sculpted cast, and a 25-day shoot later, and the end result of that inspiration became Magic Mike, an intriguing look into the world of male strippers.But, really, it's about more than that—not that you'd know it from its trailers and TV spots which mainly accomplish their tasks of impelling women to plan girls' nights out they hope will leave them all hot and bothered. What the ads don't reveal, however, is a deeper, even darker, story, one that a nearly-naked group of gyrating macho men doesn't necessarily imply.At the heart of this film is Mike (Tatum), a 30-something juggling a construction gig, a mobile detailing business, and the lead role in an exotic dancing show, all so he can save enough money to do what it is he's truly passionate about—designing and selling custom furniture. When Mike meets Adam (Alex Pettyfer), a rebellious 19-year old trying to find his way, he immediately takes him under his wing and coaches him on the world of dancing, partying, women, and making fast cash, ultimately molding him to become one of the show's biggest assets. But when Mike falls for Adam's sister, Brooke (Cody Horn), and fails to keep Adam from spiraling out of control, he begins to reassess his own life, wondering if he really has made the right choices throughout it.By no means does Magic Mike reveal any particularly new or revolutionary territory; in many ways, we've seen this movie before. But I think pairing it against a look inside what happens on and offstage at a male strip club, in part, helped it work. Initially I, admittedly, had minimal, if any, expectations for this film. Don't get me wrong, I was just as excited at the prospect of seeing a handful of ripped abs as any other feisty female, but, again, based on how the film was advertised, I expected nothing more than a sexy, raunchy two hours filled with plenty of eye-candy (not that there's anything wrong with that, but sometimes, a gal just needs a little something extra).For the rest of the review (IMDb form too short) visit: http://custodianfilmcritic.com/magic-mike/",Magic Mike
101,wandereramor,You don't even get the full monty,4,19 January 2013,"I'm just about done with Soderbergh, I have to say. Magic Mike is another lifeless movie that makes a descent into male stripping seem dull and predictable. This material honestly has a lot of potential -- in the hands of a half-decent filmmaker, the niche of male stripping could expose objectification anew by placing it in an unfamiliar context, saying something about gender relations and work in the era of the recession. The film at least attempts to be about the latter, but any thoughts of a feminist subtext are instantly dispelled by its use of women as trophies and not much more -- Cody Horn's bikini-clad good girl if you follow the straight and narrow, and Olivia Munn's topless temptress if you succumb to sin. The economic commentary is more evident, but never really goes anywhere.Without any serious understanding of sex work or objectification, Magic Mike eventually resorts to the tired narrative of the golden boy's descent into excess and drug addiction. It all feels a bit half- hearted, and the bored bro-ish acting from Channing Tatum and Alex Pettyfear doesn't help matters. There are some good supporting turns, notably Matthew McConaughey as the sleazy promoter and Kevin Nash thoroughly goofing off, and there are times when the movie is at least a little fun. But those performances and moments are bogged down by a picture that's ultimately as banal and hollow as the imitation-Miami architecture it constantly lingers on.",Magic Mike

Had I spent any more than that I would have been really bummed out. This is one stupid movie. No plot to speak of. Channing Tatum can dance but he certainly can't acthe proved that handily in The Vow.and I have almost lost my interest in Matthew McConaughey. His character was distasteful and....well, for that matter, so was the entire movie. Goodness knows we gals were all looking forward to a chick flick with male strippers dancing. Why not? Some good clean fun on the big screen? So the dancing alone was okay, but this movie proved a huge disappointment to everyone in the group I went with. Save your money, gals. This one is not worth spending on.",Magic Mike
103,EmmaDinkins,Chix Chat on Film Review: It's reigning men.,6,30 June 2012,"The film Magic Mike (as I like to refer to my husband) is a story about the title character Mike (Channing Tatum) who is an entrepreneur by day and an exotic dancer by night. I figured there would be more to the film than just the stripping sequences, but the dance scenes were all that really mattered. This movie was tailor made for Mr. Tatum, his history and skills as a dancer were what make the whole thing work. I pretty much had a smile plastered across my face during all the strip tease and my mind started to wonder during the other scenes that served as storyline filler. Dallas (Matthew McConaughey) was as fine a human specimen as you would ever see. I kept thinking what kind of workout routine does that, does he sleep crunch or what? I pride myself in not spoiling the movie for others who intend to check it out, but as seen in the trailer there is a lot of beefcake so there is no surprise that there were some pretty steamy dance performances. I'll just suffice it to say that during the Ginuwine song Pony the theater audience was audible and very attentive. I am guessing that the film intended to paint a fairly accurate portrait of the life of any exotic dancer whether male or female and they did make it look very attractive if you like the party lifestyle, of course as in life it's all fun and games until somebody gets psychedelic. Had the film strictly stayed with the exotic dance and not veered into the consequences of the extracurricular activities it would have been easily forgettable. But we did get a look into Mike outside of the night life, the audience is given a budding romance, a budding friendship with few benefits, and a crossroad in the journey of self reflection. We get to know who Mike is, we get to know who Adam (Alex Pettyfer) is and we get to know who Brooke (Cody Horn) is, the other characters um not so much. Magic Mike is not a cinematic masterpiece that will go down in history as one of the greatest films ever made, but it was entertaining, it did not take itself too seriously and made me smile more than scowl. I'm just glad it was not in 3-D with all kinds of pointy things flying at my face while watching it. I give it an amber light.",Magic Mike
104,bravesfanc,Just not enough magic,6,26 March 2014,"Besides the whole male nudity thing, this movie was actually quite enjoyable. The actors all did a very good job in the roles they were given. Matthew Mcconaughey was by far the biggest surprise to me in this movie. I didn't know he was going to do what he did. Not only the dancing but the character he portrayed was different than what I'm used to.Channing Tatum is the main attraction who seemed to be the only one who really danced before the movie and we all knew that from his previous films. I've always enjoyed his acting and this one was no different. Plain and simple, it was better than I thought it would be. It had some funny parts and the usual plot where everything seems to be going good then something bad really happens. My biggest problem with the movie was the ending. It kind of ends abruptly not that there was more to the story but they left it open for a sequel. A decent surprise.",Magic Mike

Instead it's confusing, meandering and ultimately pointless. Alex Pettyfer, the innocent entering the world of male strippers has a good face a great body but lacks life, yes, that's it, he's kind of lifeless. Channing Tatum, whose story, apparently, this is, has a body that seems to have been shaped by a genius, but a face that looks slightly unfinished. I didn't get his character at all. As an actor Channing tries far too hard. Matthew McConaughey is a hoot, Great chest and he seems to be relishing the spotlight. So, all in all, entertaining and little, very little else.",Magic Mike
106,rebecca-ry,Should be given a lot more credit,8,17 July 2012,"'Magic Mike' is the story of a 30-year-old male stripper's lifestyle and his dream to escape his career to make custom-made furniture. Loosely based on star Channing Tatum's early career in male stripping before he moved on to professional modeling and then acting.The film is advertised almost as a feel good film but it is far from it; the script is very well written but some scenes of dialogue can be a bit basic. Very cleverly, the films events change from time-of-your-life style events to out-of-control chaotic mayhem with drugs, booze and girls all at their expense. I didn't think this film would discuss the dark side of this lifestyle but they did so very well.The acting is difficult to comment on. Channing Tatum is probably the best in the film; particularly in dance scenes you can tell he takes it very seriously and his dancing is amazing. Alex Pettyfer plays 19-year-old Adam, showing the other end of the spectrum with someone just starting their career in stripping. Unfortunately, Pettyfer doesn't perform very well; I was surprised by this because in other films he has acted very well and shown a lot of potential but he disappointed me in this. Cody Horn was good in scenes with Tatum; their dialogue was natural and really funny. However, there were some points where she had no on-screen presence whatsoever. The other actors such as Matt Bomer and Joe Manganiello performed well but there was not enough dialogue with them. Matthew McConaughey was excellent, he played a creepy, aging stripper very well and genuinely made you feel uncomfortable, and his acting was quite impressive.Overall, this film is pretty good; it can be hilarious at some points but also portrays the dark side of this lifestyle very well. I would recommend this film because I think a lot of people just assume it is movie-trash when it genuinely is a good film that should be given a lot more credit.",Magic Mike

108,Treyroo,Didn't expect to like it,7,6 December 2012,"You have women screaming for you every night; you make great money, and have the time of your life every night. But there is a clock on your career and it's running out. What do you do? Mike Lane (played by Channing Tatum) is a part- time roof tiler, aspiring furniture designer, and auto customizer. While working a roofing job, he meets Adam (played by Alex Pettyfer). Adam lost a football scholarship after fighting with his coach and was forced to move in with his sister Brooke (played by Cody Horn). Then, at the end of his first day as a roofer, his boss fires him for taking too many sodas from the company cooler. On top of that, Adam (Pettyfer) can't get his car started and so Mike gives him a ride home. In return, Mike asks Adam for a favor and Adam learns how Mike spends his evenings. By day, he works construction and by night he is Magic Mike, a male exotic dancer at Xquisite. Other dancers at Xquisite include Ken (played by Matt Bomer), Tarzan (played by Kevin Nash), Tito (played by Adam Rodriguez), and Richie (played by Joe Manganiello). Shocked at first, Adam (Pettyfer) begins working at Xquisite after being hired by the manager Dallas (played by Matthew McConaughey). During this time, Mike applies for a loan to start his furniture business, is rejected, and maintains a friendship with benefits with a fellow dancer named Joanna (played by Olivia Munn). Meanwhile, Brooke (Horn) worries about her brother's descent into a life filled with drugs, booze, and one-night stands.Now, as a man, it's clear I am not part of this film's target demographic. Also, Horn and Pettyfer are almost completely unknown to me. Horn appeared in one episode of the USA series White Collar which I know I've seen, because I've seen all of them, and Pettyfer was the lead actor in a terrible sci-fi movie titled I Am Number Four. Very entertaining film, as Soderbergh films typically are. The character of Mike is actually three-dimensional as are his friends and employers and his journey to ""enlightenment"" is well-illustrated. See it.",Magic Mike
109,NikkoFranco,"Profession , Male Stripper",8,2 June 2018,"The women who gushed to see this film are accused of objectifying the strippers, well, when men ogle at films with lap or pole dancers, no one says a thing. This is sadly a double standard world and if we can also look at the small dreams of a male stripper who has a daytime job at a construction site ( Channing Tatum) who recruited a colleague ( Alex Pettyfer) and gets smitten with the latter's sister, the viewer is not isolated solely on the club rather presented a plausible story of holding onto your dreams whatever the means may be. Matthew McConnaughey in my eyes has a devilish , hilarious face that he must have carried on from his romcom days. The coaching scène in the dance studio left me in stitches. This is an entertaining film though geared towards the ladies didn't give any warning indicating that the men can't enjoy this film as well.",Magic Mike
110,mmuggi,"As people says, it's not really about the stripping",6,16 February 2021,"A fine film with a little depth, where otherwise in the trailer you get the impression that it is a film that is pure eye-candy for women and others who like men's strip. However, there is a bit more content than that, which must also disappoint some viewers who expected more strip.It is rumored that Channing Tatum and Alex Pettyfer could not agree on the set, but it could not be seen in the finished film, so good job.To return to the strip, it is the actors themselves who perform all the dance, which one must have respect for, as it is quite impressive to watch.It is a self-financed film, which one must also have respect for, but there is no score in the film, which could indicate that due to lack of budget. Despite that, there are several half a-list actors on the poster, so Channing Tatum must have the contacts in order.All in all, it is a film that is deeper than expected, with an excellent acting and a fine mix of drama and comedy",Magic Mike
111,Anyanwu,This is not good.,4,22 August 2013,"This is not good. How do Dallas and Brooke hook up at the end of the film? How???!!!! They never had anything close going on anytime before. They only had this light banter comedy thing but never EVER did they show any closeness as in, ""I think we have a thing for each other."" WTF. All she did was bash him. She never offered anything of herself. What did she bring to the relationship? This was bogus. Dallas should have bolted, did okay in the future, not great, but doing what he wanted to do. When I saw that he was crying and driving to her I said, ""Oh hell naw!"" That was bogus writing and a bogus ending. How does he go to someone who only broke him down and never gave anything of herself? We don't even like her. They never had any romance, yet at the end it comes, like out of the blue from Mars and she's all in. Bull!!!! I haven't been on User Reviews for awhile but this movie just chapped my hide. Yeah, I gave it a 4 because the dancing was good, the music(original and selected artist singles) was above average and MM was solid. CT was good.

112,MsMovie,It's Boogie Nights with strippers basically.,6,2 November 2012,"OK, so my title is a bit flippant, but honestly, as I watched this movie I did keep thinking about Boogie Nights and how similar the plot was in its basic concept. I have to say Magic Mike was a more likable character, but honestly I couldn't tell you what all the fuss that has been made about this movie was really about.Yes, good looking guys took a lot of their clothes off and MOST of them looked good (there were a couple of guys who weren't all that hot).In my honest opinion, Matthew McConnaughey has a great body, but from the neck up he looks old now (I know he's past 40, but he is looking ragged in the features), so I didn't find his stripping appealing at all really.There were a lot of musical montage parts and not as many scenes developing the characters into real human beings.Perhaps I just shouldn't watch stripper movies because I am really not into male strip shows at all, and I am embarrassed by how crazy some of my female friends got over this movie (grown, married women acting like hormone crazed teenagers).All in all, a watchable movie, pretty slow in parts, and probably not one you really want to watch with your husband or significant other, unless they are VERY secure in their masculinity, because let's face it - if this were reversed and your guy wanted to watch a movie about female strippers who looked hot, would you feel 100% comfortable seeing him drool over how perfect they were? I think not.It's worth a $1.25 rental from Redbox, but I am so glad I didn't shell out $11 for the movie (plus drink/popcorn).I gave it a 6 because it did have a story - somewhat lack lustre at that - and because a 5 or below says it's a really awful movie, and it wasn't - it just wasn't particularly good either.",Magic Mike
113,seige-hound,A great film that suffered from mismarketing,9,9 July 2016,"If there's one thing the trailers for this film got right, its that it's a film about male strippers. However, this film approaches a raunchy subject with a decent amount of class and restraint, which the trailers fail to imply.Magic Mike is a drama about the male strip scene. There's nothing much funny about what happens in the film, and it's driven by well written and well acted characters more than anything else. This isn't the male equivalent of a film like Showgirls, something that relishes in the exploitation of women, no. In fact, if the genders of Magic Mike were reversed, it would probably be heralded as a feminist masterpiece.The film is mainly about the friendship between Mike and Adam. Mike is a 30-something entrepreneur who wants to start a custom furniture business, and Adam is a 19 year old who doesn't know what to do with his life. They meet on a construction site, go to a nightclub, and Adam discovers that Mike is an incredibly talented stripper, and Adam discovers that he wants in, to the dismay of his older sister.From there comes quite a compelling character drama that goes through the highs and lows of the male stripper life, and it's compelling. Apparently, Channing Tatum (Mike) was a male stripper before he got into acting, and it shows in the beautifully filmed dance sequences. Magic Mike is essentially a well written, R-Rated Step Up film, and it's incredibly entertaining on that level.The main flaw this film has is basically how it was marketed. I can't really imagine how many straight women (and gay men) came to the film expecting some good old sexual exploitation, and instead got a lot of drama and conflict. It's good, but not what was expected. It's like ordering a hamburger and getting a taco, they're both delicious, and they both contain beef, but you'd still be a little annoyed that you didn't get what you asked for.Anyway, if you keep that in mind, you'll definitely enjoy this movie for what it is, a compelling character drama in a fairly unique setting.",Magic Mike
114,jery-tillotson-1,"""You're a 30-year-old Stripper!!!!""",1,24 May 2013,"When these horrifying words are screamed at stripper boy Channing Tatum by probably the most prudish, boring, colorless, sexless girlfriend in stripper movie heaven, Cody Horn, then the fun-loving world of our hot body boy is destroyed. After brooding through much of the latter half of the movie over this accusation, our hero stripper is shown in the dressing room glaring with hatred at his fellow exhibitionists and then throwing on his clothes, goes to the boring, colorless home of his boring, colorless girlfriend and with tears streaming down his face, vows that his days of removing his clothes for the pleasuring of women are now over. He will be a good boy. He will get a boring, colorless job to please his boring, colorless girlfriend. Is it possible for a movie to be made about HAPPY male strippers who meet fun, pretty girls who think it's fun to go with a sexy male exhibitionist? Throughout Magic Mike, we're shown hints of fun, sizzling male-male routines. But the director wants to keep this movie serious, see? He has to have lots of meaningless dialogue about ""love"" and we have to have a dreary plot where boy meets prudish girlfriend. In the most hysterical scene, the girlfriend visits the strip joint to see what goes on. Her face gets more long, hard and disgusted as the visit goes on. We're shown almost nothing of the other hot bodies. You can see them in the ""deleted"" scenes and these are dynamite. Tatum isn't a sexy stripper. He's too lanky. The ones I've known in NYC and LA are buff, if not beefy, and most are straight, most have fun wives and girlfriends and yes, they do enjoy the sexual thrill of getting naked on stage and turning on the girls/guys. We'll have to wait until some liberated film maker shows us the up and sizzling reality of male burlesque. To see a dynamic and fun stripper boy movie, check out the cult sensation, ""Just Can't Get Enough"" where the plot might be similar--gorgeous hunk gives up stripping for boring girlfriend--but this independent charmer is filled with lots of gorgeous male flesh and dance routines. And Michael Aube is sensational!",Magic Mike
115,gilligan-11,It's not about the stripping...,8,2 July 2012,"This might come as a shock to some, but this is not really a movie about male strippers. Yes, two of the principal characters are male strippers, but—as Channing Tatum's character (Magic Mike himself) says at a crucial point in the film, ""That's what I do—it's not who I am."" Amid the bountiful buttcheeks and brawny pecs on display, there is a real story here about ambition, and goals, and loyalty, and commitment, and self-actualization. Yes, I used the term ""self-actualization"" in a review of ""Magic Mike""; I told you you might be shocked.At any rate, plenty of folks (like the pathetic woman who was sitting behind me in the theater, the one who clapped like a poorly trained seal, guffawed, and cackled any time the least bit of male skin appeared on screen) will go see this movie because of all the hype about the hot male bodies in various states of undress—and they will certainly enjoy the film on that very basic level. But let's be honest here, folks—this is a Stephen Soderbergh film—and Soderbergh does not use sex and titillation gratuitously. The plot is compelling, the film is well written and masterfully directed, and Channing Tatum proves that he is much, much more than a hot body and a pretty face. For his sake, here's hoping that ""Magic Mike"" can propel him along a career path similar to those of other handsome actors who managed to overcome ""Movie Star"" looks to prove that they were genuine actors. Like Brad Pitt.",Magic Mike
116,jhkp,Magic Mike has a lot of good things in it,6,1 December 2013,"30ish Mike (Channing T.), a stripper by night and a roofer (and aspiring furniture designer) by day, gets stuck with an assistant in his roofing job who doesn't know how to do anything. Mike eventually gets this kid (a recent college dropout who lives with his cute sister) a job doing props in the strip club. In short order, one of the stars of the show, Tarzan, collapses as he's about to go on stage. The boss and host of the show, Dallas (Matthew McConaughey), is frantic. ""What can we do? Who can we get? Hey. Wait a minute. It just might work."" Maybe that wasn't the exact dialogue but I think you get the idea.I was pretty shocked that this old cliché was trotted out in a 2013 film. And yes, Dallas sends the completely inexperienced and unrehearsed kid (Alex Pettyfer) out on stage, and yes, he's a natural, and a star is born. If you can get past that, and a couple of other unlikely things that happen, as well as some plot holes, you should enjoy the show. I just think it's too bad we have to suspend disbelief several times. It takes you out of the film. It's a shame because it's well made, the actors are good, and the direction overall is excellent. It's not a terribly strong story, but it's enjoyable and entertaining. Though you've seen elements of this one before, there's a sincerity and belief in the material that carries you along. Channing Tatum gives a very likable performance as Mike. This is a guy I personally liked and believed in. In fact a couple of my buddies were strippers (aka exotic dancers) and in this film, the people behind the camera got the ethos down really well. Apparently this is a semi- autobiographical movie about Tatum, so it does have that feeling of authenticity.There are also a few entertaining strip scenes. Channing Tatum does an amazing job in these. I'm a guy but I enjoyed these scenes. The ambiance of the strip club and the way the milieu was presented brought some real life and excitement to the film. In a real strip club, though, there are all kinds of women, of all ages. There are the girls from the office taking a coworker out for her 50th birthday. There are the homely women and the fat women. Maybe I'm wrong but it seemed to me that almost all the chicks in the club shown in the film were young and cute. I guess it wouldn't have made Channing seem as cool if he was doing his act, and his simulated sex moves, in front of physically unattractive women. But that's a big part of the real audience at a male strip show.Overall the acting was good, though I'm not a fan of Matthew McConaughey generally and he did nothing to change my mind in this one. Finally I just want to say I enjoyed seeing a film about people doing their jobs, which used to be a staple of the movies but has gone by the wayside quite a bit these days. A large part of life is what we do for a living, and focusing on that in a film is a good way to reveal character and tell an interesting story.",Magic Mike
117,DubhDoo,The 24th film from Steven Soderbergh proves to be more than just a 'stripping movie'.,8,14 July 2012,"When I first saw the trailer for Magic Mike, I was not all that intrigued until I saw that it was directed by Steven Soderbergh. While hardly a Soderbergh aficionado, I thought it might be more than Channing Tatum dancing in a thong. After all, this was the same director who made a near-five hour long film about Che Guevara, so I wasn't surprised when it garnered thumbs-ups from many critics. And I was taken aback by how much I liked it, because in my opinion, the trailer does miss-sell it as just a stripper movie, or at a push, Showgirls for women, yet thankfully it proves to be more than that and much to my enjoyment a cousin of P.T. Anderson remarkable Boogie Nights. However many women in the audience became uninterested as they discovered that this was about more than men jiggling their asses on stage.Soderbergh's direction is great, providing interesting camera angles - a scene early on, where the camera is positioned on the back of Mike's jeep was a particular highlight. A scene about 2/3s in, delightfully hops between and red and blue filters. While the lack of a score worked in the film's favour. ""Fact is the law says you cannot touch! But I think I see a lotta lawbreakers in this house tonight"", proclaims Matthew McConaughey's Dallas in the brief, opening scene. McConaughey has had a great streak of quality films and even better performances recently, showcasing to cynical film-goers that he CAN act, but if you'd seen Dazed and Confused or even Lone Star back in the 90s, you already knew that. A true pleasure to watch in this, he steals every scene he's in, deserving all the plaudits he's getting. Continuing the P.T. Anderson comparison, at times his Dallas vaguely reminded me of Tom Cruise's mesmerizing and career-best turn as Frank T.J. Mackey in Magnolia. After giving his best performance with 21 Jump Street, Tatum continues to surprise me that, you know what? The guy can act, even if not marvellously, he can; making Mike a well-rounded and likable central figure, who wants to be much more than just a stripper - ""That's what I do, it's not who I am"", he says honestly in a quiet moment with Cody Horn. His quiet scenes with her were lovely to watch, particularly with the subtle ways they bounced off each other. While most audiences will flock to see him flexing his abs, he proves to be just as good at the serious elements.But wait, seriousness is not something people would expect from a film like this right? Even so, it works in the films favour throughout its entire runtime. This is a film with style AND substance - not just a stripping movie. If you go wanting a film full of naked men, you'll be disappointed; this is not Soderbergh and Tatum do The Full Monty. Yet on the other hand, if you refuse to go because of its subject matter, you are missing on a very good film, one with engaging characters and plot development. However, the thought that Channing Tatum originally wanted that Nicolas Winding Refn to direct it still intrigues me...",Magic Mike

Obviously; they need drama and problems in movies. That's a given in nearly every movie. Otherwise it gets boring. But honestly, I was disappointed. The beginning, the dancing was good. But by the end of it, you were over it. You just wanted the movie to end. Let's not mention the chessy scene when Mike goes to see his life long friend Joanna and finds out she's engaged to the guy sitting next to her. To me, in real life, the guy would have been pissed, like who the heck does this Mike guy think he is walking in and being shocked that they were engaged? Bad acting and poor performance. He would have wanted to know what was really going on with this guy and his FIANCÉ!! Like seriously guys, come on! Unfortunately, This is just one of those movies that you watch and than never watch again. Really dissapointed! Don't think I will be watching number 2. Let's hope to god they don't make a number 3!

The other male strippers are never enlarged on as regards character development - they're purely there for pecs, abs and thrust appeal.The primary character Mike isn't really developed properly.

Matthew McConaughey was in great shape for this but what male stripper wouldn't be. Not very good or funny, but worth a glance on cable. Don't go out of your way or take too much time to watch it.

Magic Mike had that old old plot line character study---The main character finally takes a good look at his sorted life while his new protégée seems to follow in his footsteps and is destined to replace him. That ole character switcheroo story has been done in endless plots. The acting is not bad but very very dry.

And the ending of the movie just leaves you flat that some people couldn't get it---but like Flashdance, the hero finds his right path or destination and wins.But most importantly, there are those tawdry naughty butt shaking strip scenes that made everyone pay the price of he movie ticket---but not enough scenes for the high prices today, Seeing this I can only say--my cousin must have had a screw loose in his head to do this for a living but it does show that a male stripper suffers in ""comfort"" from the booze, drugs and groupie followers that make it the good life!So go see it for the strip scenes, girls---no moving story, no good acting.",Magic Mike
122,jefflouvre-435-77367,"Male dancers strip off their clothes, but there's nothing beneath the pecs and glitz",4,12 September 2012,"WHEN a movie is about male exotic dancers, then the star of it is always the stripping. The movie should accept this fact and wear it as a badge of honour.Magic Mike is reminiscent of The Full Monty (1997), about a group of down-and-out men in a depressed British town who form a Chippendale-like troupe to raise money for themselves.In the process, however, they learn about family relationships, male bonding, insecurity and the male gaze inverted into the female gaze. There was a lot of empathy and humour in it.Now you have Magic Mike, a soulless flick that gets down and dirty in the world of exotic male dancing and its attendant hedonistic lifestyle, but just throws out platitudes about money, a bad economy, relationships and entrepreneurship.The movie is supposedly based on star Channing Tatum's life as an exotic dancer at 19 before he made it big in the movies.Tatum plays the titular role in this flick. He's a 30-year-old stripper who lives life to the fullest, that is, he has reckless sex and even has a friend with benefits, Joanna (Olivia Munn, whom I just saw in TV series Network).In reality, however, he has his finger in many pies, that is, he also works in a construction site and aspires to design chairs. He takes 19-year-old Adam (Alex Pettyfer of I Am Number Four) under his tutelage.His pursuit of Adam's sister, Brooke (Cody Horn), allows him to reveal his sensitive side and business acumen, but the coming together of both of them can be seen from miles away.The lamest point of the movie is when Mike tells Brooke that he wants to open a business and she asks him whether he believes he can do it. Deep stuff, man.But the guy who steals the show is Matthew McConaughey, who flashed his treasure chest in many flicks.He plays Dallas, the owner of the strip club where the guys — including Joe Manganiello, Matt Bomer, Adam Rodriguez and real-life wrestler Kevin Nash — bare their goods.Dallas exudes confidence, arrogance and cockiness. He spits out every sentence with gusto, explains the money-making side of the business and gets female customers into a frenzy with every shake of his hip.The sight of McConaughey in a skin-tight shorts makes viewers break out in laughter, but his character's earnestness wins you over. In fact, his zeal reminds me of Tom Cruise's character in Magnolia (1999), who taught men how to seduce women.Director Steven Soderbergh does the right thing by packing the movie with many scenes of the dirty dancing, so viewers get to see Mike doing two solo strips and many group strips, with different sets and costume changes.Viewers are told that the strippers give women a chance to indulge in a fantasy away from their boyfriends and husbands. But viewers aren't told about the consequences of this flick stripping away their intelligence.** wwww.jeffleemovies.com (FB and Twitter)",Magic Mike

There is too much time spent on the males dancer scenes and no time spent on a story or character development. Yes, Tatum started as a male stripper and this is nothing but a sad grab for movie-goers wallets by showing what that world is like. Who cares? Horrible dialogue and bad camera work were the least of this pictures problems. Oh, did I mention the sound was terrible as well but the abysmal soundtrack was at concert volume. I am not interested in watching male dancers but that is not the main reason I disliked this film.

And yet, there are still those who are able to know when to stop the bleeding. ""Magic Mike"" is a bit less interesting than I had expected. The story line is not so bad, where the effects of greed and reckless behavior can remind us of what we have to pay when we don't want to face the hidden truth behind success. However, the glamorous sexy rhythm that bathes the audience, especially the women, is nothing but a distraction. Tatum is a great dancer and it is nice to see he still got the moves. But the different acts become dreary, hosted by an annoying McConaughey who fits poorly on the role of a stripper and apparently can't find his place back on the big screen. Everything else is a waste, making this movie a lame excuse to show perfect bodies that are beautiful to see, with nothing to offer.

126,huntersmithx,A fun and meaningful getaway.,9,15 August 2017,"In anticipation for Logan Lucky this weekend, I've decided to look back at 2012, which in my opinion, is one of the best years for cinema so far this century. From the top 3 highest grossing films (The Dark Knight Rises/Skyfall/The Avengers), to award winners (Argo/Silver Linings Playbook/Django Unchained). That year; Magic Mike didn't score well with audiences, but received substantial reviews sitting at an 81% on Rotten Tomatoes.Much of the film's success lies on the shoulders of director Steven Soderbergh. He has been a huge inspiration to me in filmmaking. In 1989 at age 26, he was the youngest director to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for Sex, Lies, and Videotape. His directorial style is transparent in his films that range from obscure art house pictures to critically acclaimed masterpieces.What me and many other people who enjoyed Magic Mike can agree with- the directing, lighting, editing, and soundtrack all fuse together.This cinematography is excellent; from vivid spotlights and camera angles centered around dances on the Fourth Of July and Mike flaunting his hip hop swagger in a black vest, Mike and his friends partying after a night of stripping and foreplay, and an ecstasy infused nightclub sequence- mixing a variety of color palettes and close up angles makes the environment of Tampa, Florida a breathing entity.Mike and Adam are the most real characters in the film, as they struggle with realizing their dreams and the perception of their lives as male strippers by other people, including Adam's sister Brooke.Down to brass tacs; Magic Mike is an underrated masterpiece, and among Soderbergh's best, reminding us of an important lesson in quality movie watching- Don't judge a book by it's cover.

127,anthonymichaelbangert,Fun and Realistic,8,19 February 2015,"Mike is a stripper with dreams and goals of being more. He manages many different jobs and has been saving up money to open a custom furniture business. He meets a young kid, who he takes under his wing, teaching him all about the business. The kid quickly gets sucked into the wrong side of the business, being involved with greed and drugs. This movie was good. It was fun and realistic. The stripper scenes were nice, and sexy, but they weren't what this movie really focused on. This movie shows what life outside of a male stripper's onstage persona is like. The acting in this movie was OK. Altogether, I was pleasantly shocked at how much I enjoyed this film, and I hope the second one delivers the power and deep story (still keeping bits of humor throughout) that this first did.Soundtrack: 10- This was a stripper's soundtrack. Great mixes, a lot of fun. The soundtrack worked well for the film.Script: 10- The writer of this script knew how to create a compelling story within the world of male strippers. A great job there.Originality: 8- The plot points are predictable, but I give this movie credit for doing some great new ideas, instead of rehashing every old idea that Hollywood can think of.Cinematography: 9- The cinematography actually added to the movie's story, especially in the stripper scenes. The director had a good eye for where to go to get the best view at each part of the many dances.Casting: 6- The casting choices were not the best. However, casting an ex-stripper as the star, and Matthew McConnahey was a good idea. Also, Gabriel Iglesias was a good choice for a supporting role.Acting: 7- There were some actors that were terrible. However, Channing Tatum made up for a lot of that by himself with an excellent performance. He was so convincing because he was real. He wasn't trying to be some exaggerated character. Mike was completely based in reality, giving an excellent authenticity.Overall: 8.3",Magic Mike

Of course I wanted to see it because the cast is sexy and they strip. But it wasn't worth it. Thank God I didn't actually pay to see this in theaters. First of all, they advertise this movie with all the hot actors but really, besides Channing Tatum and Alex Pettyfer they hardly have any lines. Joe Manganiello and Adam Rodriguez should have never agreed to do this. They were mainly there just to look sexy (which, I mean, they do well. Very well.) They should have had bigger roles. The story is pretty bland and nothing gets resolved. Obviously they were relying on the male stripping to get women to flock to the theaters, so they didn't really need to make a great story. Bottom line; this is an OK movie for a girls night in, but honestly you should just skip it.",Magic Mike

130,LBarlane24,Female Gaze: The Movie,4,7 May 2020,"Directed by Steven Soderbergh, Magic Mike stars Channing Tatum as the titular character, along with Alex Pettyfer, Cody Horn, and Matthew McConaughey and revolves around a male stripper who befriends another young male and ... that's basically it. Okay, there's a lot more to it than that, but it's honestly not that interesting to begin with.This movie involves nothing more than a bunch of ripped dudes showing off their assets to a large female audience every twenty seconds. The one and I only thing that I guess resembles an actual plot is the scenes involving Cody Horn's character, Brooke, the sister of Pettyfer's character, The Kid. And that would've been totally fine if the actress showed more than one facial expression. I really can't say much about Tatum, McConaughy, and all the other actors are honestly not much better. The majority of them basically play caricatures of themselves more than actual characters. Alex Pettyfer gives a decent enough performance one in a while. But due to the shallow script, he does not stand out much either.Now about the plot, there really isn't one to speak of. It's pretty much the same scenarios over and over: first, there's a jacked man baring it all, then there's a scene with him interacting with all the other strippers, then they're all shown having a party/get-together of some-sort, and then there's a long interaction between Mike, The Kid, and the sister; lather, rinse, and repeat.The direction is honestly not much better. As whenever the actors are outside (or whenever the outside is shown throw a window), everything looks glaringly yellow; it seemed as if the camera lenses were soaked in whale urine or something.Overall, Magic Mike is an overrated shallow soft-core porn (aimed mostly at women) disguised as a dramedy and I rate it 3.9/10.",Magic Mike

I didn't really catch much of a plot.OK, now the good parts. The strip scenes - YUM! Pure beefcake. The Channing Tatum strip scenes were pretty cool (I wasn't sure if it was him or a double but whomever it was really dances well). The best part of the movie is Matthew McConaghuey. His body is ripped and he is dripping with charisma. Yes, he basically plays himself in every movie he's in. But damn, he is an interesting character to play!

132,DrewAlexanderR1,Boogie Nights Light,6,2 July 2015,"When I saw Magic Mike it reminded me of Boogie Nights in a lot of ways: the plot of the story, the topic of the story, and the ups and downs of the business. Mike (Channing Tatum) is a young man who is trying to make the next move in his life. However, because of his background he is stuck in the in-between phase of what he is currently doing and what he wants to do. He meets a struggling Adam (Alex Pettyfer) on one of his construction gigs and decides to bring him into his world of male stripping. Mike believes he is doing the right thing by helping the kid out, but when he meets Brooke (Cody Horn), Adam's sister, he is reminded of the unstableness and shallow quality of his career. Characters like Dallas (Matthew McConaughey) exemplify the surface of the flashy life of a male stripper, and they also show its shortcomings. Magic Mike is a entertaining story that fades as you get further into it. It is a good film to watch if you're looking to kill some time, but if you're looking for anything more than that check out the real thing, Boogie Nights.",Magic Mike

After an hour of sitting in silence I turned to the wife and said ""Whats this about then? Its going nowhere"" her reply was ""I know its RUBBISH"" which sums it up in a nutshell. There is literally is NO STORY, no events, the characters had promise had there have been a point to why they came together. It is neither action, comedy, thriller, romance or adventure. it's two hours of the boring bits in a good film that you forget as soon as the good stuff starts just to pad it out.If you read the positive reviews they all surround the stripping, so basically lonely women doing the bias thing that they criticise men for doing, ""ogling and objectifying"", which I don't have a problem with in its self, but using IMDb to skew ratings which can affect whether people waste (lets face it A LOT OF MONEY on at current cinema prices) is damn out of order when they just rate something on its ""hot man"" concept rather than film quality.As for spoilers there is no chance of anyone writing a spoiler on this movie, because nothing happens (does the fact telling you nothing happens count as a spoiler?).",Magic Mike
135,italo505,Does anybody really care about Magic Mike's plot? Really?,6,29 May 2013,"I must be the only one sucker that actually thought that Magic Mike should have had a good plot and actually brought substance to an otherwise ordinary story of a stripper who is trying desperately to make it big in Miami. I must have been crazy... I mean, I thought the cast alone is phenomenal headlined by Sexiest Man Alive Channing Tatum, True Blood's hunky Joe Manganiello (who can't quite dance), pretty boy Matt Bomer and an aging yet still ripped Matthew McConaughey. Their characters making a living off dancing and stripping for women every weekend without any plans for the future whatsoever. I was counting on Steven Soderbergh to direct this movie and make it compelling and relatable as he's done in the past with movies like Ocean's 11, Eric Brokovich, Traffic and, most recently, Side Effects starring Channing as well. So it's no surprise that I was expecting a bit more than just a plain story where Channing's Mike (his stage name is Magic Mike) takes an unknown boy (Alex Pettyfer as Adam) and turns him into a sensational stripper overnight. And that's about it for Magic Mike, not much more than that plot, with the predictable love story that develops between Mike and Adam's sister Brooke (newcomer Cody Horn) and, obviously the stripper performances which fill up the empty blanks (which are quite a few). I will give credit where credit is due and it goes to Matthew McConaughey for portraying Dallas, a seasoned stripper with more ambition than everyone combined. He shows up in this tiny Speedos to the gym and shows the new boy how to take off his clothes like a man, having sex with the mirror and standing uncomfortably close to the straight boy in order to get his sexy on. And he finally delivers, just like Dallas. McConaughey makes moving sexy easy which I suppose it's no easy task. Same can be said for Channing whose presence on the stage is unparalleled in comparison to the rest of the group, but he's been down that road before so it's no surprise that he's still got those moves in him.",Magic Mike

As a gay man, I would jump at the chance to see half naked, actors dancing on stage but this movie I wasn't to keen on seeing, mostly because they were no men of color in the cast but that's a topic for another type of review. Overall, the movie was kind of all over the place. It took the movie about one hundred years to even start some action. I felt like I was watching a documentary or a found footage film with the cheesy dialogue and the weird shots. And is it me or was Channing Tatum the only who had rhythm. The director should have hired actors who could actually dance and look like believable exotic dancers. Especially the character named ""Tarzan"". Did they really think he could give a half ass performance and we not notice on huge cinema screen?! I was became intrigued when they started showing ""Mike's"" story and struggle to follow his dream and make something of himself but I wanted more. More for his story and journey. ""The Kidd"" character could have had less air time because he really didn't learn anything.

I expected more ""Drama"", than ""Comedy"" something like ""The Wrestler"" (2008) with Mickey Rourke, but eventually I realize, it is Channing Tatum.

138,coiffuremixte,electric dreams,10,12 September 2012,"Bringing things down to essentials. What is it that makes a good film ? The story, the actors the photography. All three of these elements are of exceptional quality in Magic Mike – one of the very best films of this year, or any. Let's start with the story : this is a Faustian story where a naive character is drawn into a seductive and dangerous world by a charismatic figure and who is corrupted by this world, in the meantime the charismatic (Magic Mike) figure finds himself regretting what his effect on an innocent and also his destructive way of life leading him to make a personal sacrifice for the corrupted youth and seek his own redemption through love. The setting for this story happens to be the world of male strippers but could just have well been the world of gangsters or gamblers or alcoholics. What is it that makes this story so enthralling ? Essentially it's Channing Tatum and his star-making performance; the emotional and physical investment combined with subtlety which comes from an actor who is interpreting is own true-life story. Marlon Brando in On The Waterfront looks self conscious and heavy-handed by comparison. He is that good in Magic Mike. The rest of the cast is equally inspired especially Matthew McConaughey who will undoubtedly be rewarded with at least a nomination at the next Oscars ceremony. Soderbergh directs this film so well it makes you wonder if you're dreaming, the combination of direction of actors and expressive camera-work with the musical/stripping numbers carrying the weight of both a uninhibited sexual energy and absurd exhibitionism which can be seen as a metaphor for Hollywood itself.Soderbergh can retire from film at the apex of his art form although it does seem a shame when he is so at home artistically in this unlikely naturalistic 'family' drama. The structure recalls the musical comedies of the thirties and forties starring Ataire and Rogers, ironically the debauchery is still carried along with naive sincerity by Mike and his fellow strippers ; dancers are dancers, the lifestyle and the manners have changed entirely, replacing the desire to transcend desire and baseness through grace and dexterity with a pure sexual physicality but still, in all its crudeness, there is, in the act of simulation, a form of sublimation, a form of art in taking desire and expressing it in a 'play' a 'dance' a 'scenario'. When the neophyte stripper is thrown into the fray for his first time and kisses a woman full on the mouth he is told firmly that he has broken the rules, transgressed, but he is also told that it worked out for him because the audience dug it, this scene somehow typifies the whole perfection of Magic Mike and its delicate yet crude beauty.",Magic Mike
139,jeddjong,"The ""Magic"" is all smoke, mirrors and bare buttocks.",4,26 June 2012,"Everyone starts somewhere. Elvis was a truck driver, Peter Parker was a nerdy high-school student and Abraham Lincoln was a vampire hunter. Before he was taking out Cobra vipers in G.I. Joe or teenage drug dealers in 21 Jump Street, Channing Tatum was taking off his clothes as a 19-year-old male stripper in Tampa Florida. With this premise as a jumping-off point, Magic Mike tells the tenuously autobiographical tale.Channing Tatum plays Michael Lane – odd job working and erstwhile furniture designer by day, the stripper of the title by night. At his roofing job, he comes across Adam (Pettyfer), a 19-year-old ne'er do well who lives with his disapproving sister Paige (Horn). Mike takes a shine to the kid, whom he nicknames, well, ""The Kid"", and brings him along to Xquisite Male Revue, where he dances. There, Adam meets the gang of male strippers, led by the cocky (pun totally intended), charming Dallas (McConaughey). It's not long before Adam finds himself onstage and he becomes an instant hit. However, life in the spotlight (and in g-strings) soon gets to Adam's head, with Mike and Paige caught in the crossfire.With every female starlet stripping to their skivvies on screen as a rite of passage, the guys finally get their due, and this is sure to be a welcome change for the gals and gay men in the audience. The knee-jerk reaction is to point and snigger and yes, director Soderbergh doesn't underestimate the power of his target demographic (which this reviewer is not a part of) and hands out what you came for in spades. However, if he thought that putting Cody Horn and Olivia Munn into bikinis and slipping in one scene of Mircea Monroe's silicone-enhanced bare breasts would even the playing field, he was sorely mistaken.It would easy to slap the label ""Showguys"" on this film and call it a day, but Soderbergh is a better director than Paul Verhoeven by far and the movie treats the vocation with a fair amount of dignity – well, as much dignity as leather vests and star-spangled thongs deserve. The cry of ""strippers are people too!"" is present in the form of Mike's sensitive custom furniture design aspirations and the attempt to show he has a life outside of the strip club. Also, the film doesn't look as flashy as one would be led to think; Soderbergh doesn't treat the cast the way Michael Bay treats helicopters and sunsets. However, if you came to see Tatum and co. wiggle their collective behinds, you'll be counting the minutes till the movie moves back into clothes removal mode.Tatum is a famously wooden leading man, but he is a good dancer – after all, he is a Step Up alum. Soderbergh seems to know that the rest of the cast can't offer a lot beyond their chiselled abs and wisely lets Tatum do the bulk of the dancing. It does stretch credibility to think Adam would become an ace dancer overnight, as it is shown he doesn't have much dancing experience to start with. Tatum and Pettyfer have a decent bromance that doesn't reach the heights of Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law in the Sherlock Holmes movies or the Wolf Pack in the Hangover flicks, but it works and is portrayed fairly realistically. Pettyfer has been pushed hard in recent years as a pretty-boy hunk to watch, but frankly he's not a great actor though he is better than Tatum. He's got a persona that falls exactly in-between clean-cut and bad boy, and that alone would make most girls go weak at the knees.Cody Horn has pretty much sprung out of nowhere to take the female lead, but a little research reveals she's the daughter of former Warner Bros. Studio head Alan Horn. Before you shout ""nepotism"", let it be known that she's... just okay. She pulls off the watchful, strait-laced older sister thing decently, though she does have trouble with more emotional scenes, and her sexual tension with Tatum doesn't fully ignite. She looks like if Kristen Bell and Kristen Stewart had a daughter, which does sound slightly appealing, but it's hard to see her as a prominent Hollywood starlet in future.Just when you thought Matthew McConaughey was back on the straight and narrow with the legal thriller The Lincoln Lawyer, he's back to his shirt-phobic ways playing, in essence, himself. If anyone can pull off the cowboy huckster thing, it's McConaughey and his built-in Texas drawl. He even sings a self-written ditty and plays the guitar. He's backed by a bunch of TV stars: Matt Bomer from White Collar, Joe Manganiello from True Blood and Adam Rodriguez from CSI Miami. As eye candy, they fit the one-dollar bill, but it's a good thing they're given supporting parts because they're very clearly small screen actors.It's tempting to write this one off based on the two words ""male"" and ""strippers"" and, guess what – you won't be completely wrong. It's a celebration of the intriguing double standard where women are allowed a night of squealing, voyeuristic debauchery whereas a man who does the same would be considered a pig (the real pig that does appear in the movie is adorable). Perhaps it's revenge for how a girl who sleeps around is labelled a slut, while a guy who does the same is a stud. Even though there is an effort made to construct a semi-serious drama around the premise, we're left with more flesh than fleshed-out characters, and a very unsatisfying ending.

There's a lesson to be learned.There's a subplot involving a budding romance between Tatum's character and Adam's sister. There are also many scenes of group sex and general wildness. Sex seems to be one of Soderbergh's favorite themes and he portrays sexuality without any pretense or hang-ups.Matthew McConaughey does a splendid comic turn as the club's owner/master of ceremonies and there are many comic scenes throughout the movie.

Well, for one there are a few nude scenes with women, second there is absolutely nothing gay about this film, and third it's probably the dream life for most men: getting naked and getting paid for it, as well as hooking up with fine women. People have complained that this film has no story, but it does! It's a story of an entrepreneur who is trying to succeed with his dreams, only getting trapped by the world of lust, drugs and shame. The end is not the best ending that could've been made, but the rest of the film makes up for that. Go check out this up beat, provocative, fun, and, at times, emotional film.",Magic Mike
144,amazingamy123,If youth has a face.,6,2 April 2020,"It seems that he has everything. Lots of dates, lots of crazy night, lots of cash, and lots of dance skills. But that perfect body cannot hide the cruelty of youth. After a nap in the middle of the night, Mike carefully flattened his cash on the corner of the table, folded them into a stack, and put a thick book on top. His dream is to be the owner of a furniture store, designing weird furniture and sell them to customers. He compiled his own product catalog, went to the bank in an unsuitable suit, and the female staff blushed when she saw his handsome face. However, she still declined him a loan. He gently comforted her: ""It's Okay."" At the end of his youth, he wanted to leave stripping and go to Miami, but when he came out of the bank, he didn't know how to make that happen. He had to go back to the party and resume his old profession. He clumsily explained his plan to the girl he liked, but Brook asked the right question, did he really believe that his dream can come true?In his eyes, there was a kindness and indifference that was not commensurate with his profession. There was tears on that face that resembled Gump.There were 40--50 year-old strippers, still muscular and working hard but fail to hold the chubby woman. There war also a 19-year-old boy he brought in, willing to walk on the stage even before he can drink. Money comes fast all in small changes smelling like women's perfume. The boy learned how to seduce women and do drugs. Mike left, but a new generation of ""Magic Mike"" come on stage, growing old in the scream of women and the taste of money.Heroes are most afraid of shortness of breath, and beauty is most afraid of twilight. Looking forward to the future, the boy thanked Mike for letting him see the world. How ironic! Maybe ten years ago Mike thought the same thing. Channing Tatum is lucky, he left the industry. But what about the others? They have their own paths which we can't predict.",Magic Mike
145,DoctorRabbit,"Not What You'd Expect, And That's A Good Thing",7,4 July 2012,"At first glance, Magic Mike seems like a film that doesn't have much to offer besides men stripping and a generic romantic comedy plot. However, the film is a lot better than you'd think it be and it has a lot more to offer than just male stripping.The trailer for the film is VERY misleading and makes it appear to be a romantic comedy when the film is much more of a comedy-drama centered the life of Channing Tatum's character and Alex Pettyfer. The film has a good mix of comedy and drama and also has a surprisingly dark 2nd half to it which I really enjoyed. This has really been a good year for Channing Tatum. I used to think he was a terrible actor but with this and 21 Jump Street, he has proved me otherwise. He is terrific here and even better than he was in 21 Jump Street since he is also dealing with drama here and not only comedy. The rest of cast did a good job and Matthew McConaughey stole every scene that he was in. The only person who didn't do a good job was the Tatum's love interest Cody Horn who gave a very stale performance. Despite a lot of man ass, the dance scenes in the film are a ton of fun to watch, even if you are a guy. Soderbergh did an excellent job directing and I really loved the cinematography and style that was used for the film. However, Magic Mike has some problems with it that keep it from being the great movie it could've been. My biggest problem with it is that the whole film felt very disjointed and that really bugged me. The film didn't feel like it had a good flow to it and scenes would just happen one after another in random order. I got used to this after a bit into the film, but it still bugged me quite a bit. The film could've also done without the romantic subplot which served no purpose to the film what so ever and really just dragged it out longer than it needed to be. I also didn't care for the way the film ended either. There's a scene that takes place 5 minutes before the final scene of the film that I actually felt would've fit the film much better and left more of an impact than the final scene of the film did.Overall, Magic Mike isn't as good as it could've been, but it's also a lot better than you'd expect it to be. It's not a movie that is strictly for female's and is one that male's can also enjoy. Women might actually be disappointed that there isn't as much stripping in the film as you would expect and may not like some of the darker parts of it. Don't blow this movie off because of the subject matter. Give it a shot, and I can guarantee you that you'll be surprised by how much you will enjoy Magic Mike.",Magic Mike
146,Jared X,Breathtaking and Charming but no Burlesque,10,7 October 2012,"Stephen Soderburgh's Magic Mike can't even hold a molten candle next to Burlesque, Wes Anderson's newest masterpiece, or Showgirls, their derivative grandmother ""classic"" by P.T. Barnum Anderson. Each attempts to tells a similar story: a sexy newbie kid emerges from the woodwork like a spring aphid to attack an established old tree – in particular case Cher and reefer-maddened Bongo Boy.Without being too plot-disclosing, I will attest to the performances, which were authentic and somewhat convincing. I was suffering a severe migraine during Burlesque, which turned out to be a brush with mad cow disease. Therefore, Burlesque wins.The contest is not betwixt Cher and Matthew McConaughey, but Alexis Pettyfor and Christina Tequilera. Neither can sing, so the competition unfortunately comes down to acting and physical sex appeal. Each manages to charm no-one whilst revolt many. Ali wins by a tattoo.Where Burlesque rings true, however, is in its essential self-discomfort, whereas Magic Mike is obsequiously and shamelessly narcissistic. When it comes to spreading the love, however ungratifying, Burlesque spreads it like nobody else. Burlesque triumphs.Mr. Soderburgh would do well to take a few notes from fellow provocateurs Ryan and Brad, namely: go into television instead of the ""big"" screen. Lose your simulated machismo and embrace your inner queer.",Magic Mike

Very pleasurable to watch. The music throughout was pretty good - I even youtubed some of the soundtracks. Alice Russell has an amazing voice.However the storyline was weak and poor. There wasn't really a story, it was just stripping! Which wasn't bad to watch, but I would have rather had a good plot to go with the sexy nakedness of Channing!",Magic Mike
148,Jb11174,Saw in the movie theater and Watch it every time it's on TV!!!,8,20 February 2014,"Channing Tatum played a great role as Magic Mike, the best stripper working in Tampa. This movie is loosely based off of Channing Tatum short lived stripping gig before acting. Although this movie shows lots of short tease acts by the guys, it's really not about strippers. It's about guys trying to make money fast for their own means. In Channing Tatum's case, to start a furniture business. Magic Mike takes Alex Pettyfyr's character ""The Kid"" under his wing and teach him the ropes to the business. Within three months The Kid goes from having no job or money living in his sister's apartment to rolling cash stripping and selling drugs. This all to quick made cash and heavy recreational drug use, The Kid makes some poor decisions and finds himself in a jam in which Magic Mike bails him out. After the bailout and lack of respect from those around him, being 30 and a stripper is starting to affect his self-respect and lack luster of finding live and a serious career.The actors picked to be the strippers are perfect, and Matthew Mc rocked.Beautiful scenes on the beach in Fla. area are my favorite and have vacationed there. Wish the chemistry between Cody & Mike picked up a bit more, can't wait to see the sequel. Hoping there are new characters besides Channing Tatum in the sequel.",Magic Mike
149,bmerrett,The Only Magic here was a Disappearing Story,2,19 July 2013,"A every poor script, bad direction and wooden acting drove this Channing Tatum vehicle right over the cliff. There is too much time spent on the males dancer scenes and no time spent on a story or character development. Yes, Tatum started as a male stripper and this is nothing but a sad grab for movie-goers wallets by showing what that world is like. Who cares? Horrible dialogue and bad camera work were the least of this pictures problems. Oh, did I mention the sound was terrible as well but the abysmal soundtrack was at concert volume. I am not interested in watching male dancers but that is not the main reason I disliked this film. After it was established that they did different routines in their acts it was unnecessary to keep showing them doing that. Unless you are a hardcore Channing Tatum fan this is not worth the time spent to watch it. Even then...think about it before you do.",Magic Mike
150,eggartrealty,Really disappointing,4,13 July 2012,"After reading several good reviews for this movie (on Rotten Tomatoes) I decided to see it with a couple of friends for a fun night out. We were really disappointed.I can remember when ""A Night in Heaven"" came out in 1983 to awful reviews - however, this is pretty much the same movie without the frontal that many people in the theatre were hoping for.Channing Tatum did what he does naturally - dance and strip. But this guy is a horrible actor.P.S. Matthew McConaughey probably should have padded his g-string - there just wasn't like anything there.",Magic Mike
151,edwards_trina-560-690634,No Magic at All,2,15 August 2012,"I could not watch this movie all the way through. I obviously knew that the movie was not written all about the stripping life. The dance scenes were good. The story line between Tatum and the girl he screws with on and off was motionless to me. I didn't feel like it needed to be in the movie or I just didn't like the way it was presented. I don't think the girl that played his love interest was good looking either. I did however like her character somewhat. I know I shouldn't be commenting on this since I didn't finish watching it but if you are looking for an entertaining movie to have a movie night with, THIS IS NOT THE MOVIE. But if you just need something to fill time, I say go ahead.",Magic Mike

Magic Mike is fun, funny and hella sexy but thats about it. this movie has no real plot and although most of the actors in the movie are extremely talented their acting abilities are not presented here at all and thats just fine. I know they wish to be more than just a strippers movie but they are not. not really. This movie is all about the hottest guys on the planet and their awesome dance moves (unless you count out Kevin Nash, which is a favorite of mine in the wrestling ring but cannot dance to save his life). I drooled all over myself the entire movie and really wished i had someone to come home to after that sex-on-a-stick of a movie.",Magic Mike

You would assume it was just about the stripping, but Soderbergh nailed the scene. I live in St Pete, where the movie was filmed, and I honestly felt it was just being filmed in all local bars. The people, the drugs, the filth, the hot guys, it's all there!! Channing Tatum is no joke, when he moves, all eyes are on him. The plot surrounding the two main characters was well developed, I honestly think this is one of Soderberghs best yet. Although the film was advertised as a male stripper film, it is so much more, it shows the filthy women. It shows the heavy drug use. It is just so much more than a film, it is cinema!",Magic Mike
154,moossaboossa,Stripping aside...,8,17 November 2012,"Stripping aside, this movie was actually quite serious; not to mention realistic. I agree that based on the trailer my previous sentence seems rather unlikely, as I too expected an irrelevant plot and a lot of booty. What I got from ""Magic Mike"" instead was a lot of story...and yeah, a lot of flesh. The movie centres around Mike (Channing Tatum), an ""entrepreneur"" who's ambition in life is to open a custom-made furniture business. Mike is ""Magic Mike"" the stripper by night, and Michael Lane- the contractor and eager loan candidate by day. While working as a contractor Mike meets Adam (Alex Pettyfer) a penniless nineteen year old who lost his football scholarship after assaulting his coach. One night, after Adam successfully (and unknowingly) recruits women as customers for Mike's strip show, Mike introduces Adam to the world of stripping. This is all very romantic and, on the surface, rather mundane. Based on my previous description it's essentially a slightly more sexed up rendition of ""The Blind side""; but it's the little things that did it for me. I loved how ironic it was that while Mike was frequently sleeping with a psychologist and behavioral analyst; it was actually Adam's sister who calls him out on his behavior and whom he feels comfortable confiding in. I loved the contrast between Adam: who became so blinded by the spotlight to realize his own decline into drugs, alcohol and danger- and Mike: who finally shed light onto his own unhappiness with his job and apparent disinterest in continuing it. It was a clever movie with a lot of meaning; a sister's concern for her brother, a stripper's comfort yet eternal dissatisfaction with their job; the world behind ""show business"" and the hot, sweaty bodies (namely of Channing Tatum- that man can move!). Don't get me wrong, there's lots of fun to be found in this movie. Just look out for the glimpses beneath the surface, as I do think they deserve recognition.",Magic Mike
155,JenniferClapton,It was worth watching for Tatum,5,8 June 2013,"Oh, the beauty that is Tatum Channing. This movie is worth watching just for him. I didn't particularly care for his dancing, although, he was good. Nothing beats Christopher Atkin's strip tease in A Night In Heaven.The girl (the kid's sister) is really cute but a terrible actress. She's irritating too. The kid, whatever his name was, was a bad choice for his role in the movie. You would think as he continues on with his dancing career he would have toned up a bit throughout the movie but this was not to be. Not a very good actor either. Matthew Mchaunnahey (however you spell his name, don't wanna look it up) did a strip tease that was disturbing. Leave your clothes on Matthew, nobody wants to see you dance. And that mountain man looking dude, the older dude with the long hair...I don't think there's a woman on the planet who wants to see that strip. What were they thinking casting him?

156,dawnr470,Dancing makes up for bad acting,7,22 July 2012,"I'll admit it.....just like many other women in my age group, I wanted to see Magic Mike solely for the dancing scenes and really didn't care about the story. But if we DO have to sit through the story, it should at least be a good one. Don't get me wrong....I like the idea that Mike is trying to improve his life, but find it VERY hard to believe that he'd give up his life savings and his dream to help out someone he barely knows. And for what? Some girl who he may or may not get lucky with? And as for the girl, can you say judgmental BITCH? There was nothing sympathetic about her at all, nothing to make me warm up to her and try to see things from her point of view. Yes, she's frustrated with taking care of her younger brother, but she plays the martyr very well and lays a guilt trip better than anyone I know, including my own mother. I just can't see what Mike sees in her.However.....the dancing scenes do make up for a lot of the lack of character development. All of the guys do a great job but Channing Tatum absolutely owns that stage. If you haven't seen the clip of him dancing to ""My Pony"", you don't know what you're missing! There was enough humor thrown in with it to make it seem not so dirty, just a bunch of guys having some fun.As for Matthew M, the leather chaps just really don't do it for me with him. He seemed sleazy, which I guess was the intention, but he just didn't have the appeal that he's had in previous movies. Of course, when standing next to Channing T, anyone would pale in comparison.",Magic Mike
157,pencritical,No plot and horrible acting,2,3 November 2012,"I was really looking forward to this film. I wanted to see a funny and uplifting movie and I thought this sounded awesome. It wasn't. It was just awful. A waste of 90 minutes or so of my life. About the only thing good about this film is the dancing, which, was at best, just OK. The script should have ended up on the junk pile. The movie goes absolutely nowhere and is filled with characters I couldn't care less about. Channing Tatum was mediocre, but then he always is. I can't see what anyone sees in him besides the body. He's not attractive and after seeing several films he has starred in, I'm still unconvinced he has any acting talent at all. I watched him in 21 Jump Street and almost threw up when he stuck out his tongue (ever hear of a tongue scraper dude? - OMG - NASTY). But, he shines in comparison to Alex Pettyfer, who's character portrayal was one of the most boring performances I have seen on screen in ten years. The no name that plays Pettyfer's sister wasn't much better. Over the top line delivery of over the top lines. Matthew McConaughey was gorgeous, but even he couldn't pull a rabbit out of that script. The writing was excruciatingly bad and completely unbelievable. I wouldn't recommend it. Not even if you are really bored. Go for a walk instead, or go watch grass grow. I guarantee you it will be more fun.",Magic Mike
158,filmcritic3,Worth leaving the theatre and demanding a refund.,1,28 June 2012,"Occasionally, I find myself sitting in a press screening and questioning my sanity for submitting myself to celluloid torture. The movie I'm watching is horrendously bad I begin counting the seconds of my life I'm losing. Mind you, this does not happen often. Generally, my sense of duty and humanity towards my countless fans, and you are legion, keeps me in my seat until the final frame has passed through the lens. Alas, such is not the case with MAGIC MIKE. After sitting through the movie's first hour, I simply could not take any more. I realized nothing could possibly happen in the film's remaining reels that could justify the preceding crud. The acting was terrible, the story trite and the characters totally unsympathetic and the endeavor offers no redeeming values. The more I watched MAGIC MIKE, the more I could feel my IQ dropping. It was worse than watching HGTV. Not surprisingly, I walked out of MAGIC MIKE. It's truly that god awful. MAGIC MIKE is supposed to be a comedy about male strippers. The concept certainly has potential. What I witnessed in the first hour was an example of Chinese Cinema at its worst. With few exceptions, Chinese producers make movies without scripts, just rough outlines. What the producers of MAGIC MIKE have are a few cheesy dance routines. As an excuse for putting these routines on the Silver Screen and hijacking your hard earned entertainment dollars, Scriptwriter Reid Carolin surrounds the routines with a banal tale. There is a plot, but its so clichéd and mundane it could easily be housed in a 30 minute TV show. Even the most feeble minded viewer can see the plot points several reels in advance. The characters are not cardboard, they are Paper Mache. If you thought the characters in BATTLESHIP were superficial, MAGIC MIKE makes them appear Oscar caliber. Carolin should be placed in the equivalent of time out for writers until he has completed 90 days indulgence. The funniest element of the film is watching Kevin Nash, a near 60- year old pro wrestler, pose as a stripper. Nash's knees are shot from years of abuse bouncing off ropes and leaping from turnbuckles. Compassionately, he is relegated to the back line of the stripper troupe. His routines are inconsequential and often don't match what the other dancers are doing on stage. It's excruciatingly apparent he's struggling with anything but the simplest of movements.Mathew McConaughey, plays Dallas, the owner and operator of the male stripper troupe. He made a public statement, just days before this film's release, that he was turning a new leaf in his personal life. He stated he would be more mature, and act more adult. Perhaps the statement was his personal mea culpa for this movie.Channing Tatum, who was actually breaking free from his customary tin man performances, throws his entire career back to square one with an absolutely horrid presentation. If he acted any more disenchanted with this role, the producers would have paid him not to be in the movie.I can't believe Director Steven Soderbergh opted to helm this bile. He is capable of much finer work. I imagine there will be some who find MAGIC MIKE appealing; probably sexually frustrated adult women and gay men. There is always someone who will like something regardless of how tasteless it is. For this, I award you no points and may God have mercy on your souls. I walked out on MAGIC MIKE. It is truly excrement on celluloid and everyone associated with this endeavor would be well advised not to put it on their resumes. Avoid this one as you would herpesTHE RATING FOR MAGIC MIKE = F",Magic Mike
159,jsmn-kane,Not good,4,30 June 2012,"I, like a lot of my female friends, was looking forward to this flick. Did I expect it to be an academy award winner, of course not. But I was very disappointed. First off, the male strippers scenes were okay, two of the strippers in particular were not even good looking, nasty in my eyes (tarzan and the kid). Secondly, the dialogue between the actors/actresses seemed so forced and fake, not a good sign. Third, the scenes with the drugs and sex were so stupid, really a pig?! I have heard it should be compared to Boogie Nights (which I have seen) not even close. Fourth, the plot was unrealistic and silly. It could have been so much better! I will not lie and tell you that Channing was not hot, his dance moves were some of the best I have seen and he obviously worked hard to make himself look the part. The Kid, was not cute at all, had a major bad attitude, hard to buy it. The sister to the kid, bad actress and not very pretty, hello I happen to know in Hollywood there are a ton of hot chicks that could have played this part a billion times better. Matthew Mc, don't even get me started, he got on my nerves so bad. I happen to be from TX, and I do not have his stupid overdone drawl! And when he finally dances at the end, he looks so egotistical and narcissistic. At least the other dancers seemed to want to dance for the ladies. A passer upper.",Magic Mike
160,xThe_Fury,Magic Mike - A Review by Brandon Krzysztof,4,29 June 2012,"""Magic Mike"" is a drama that is centered around the lifestyle of male stripping. It's been awhile since a movie of this sort has came out. Using solid choreography and a steady dose of dialogue, ""Magic Mike"" hopes to capture the audiences attention not only with the much anticipated stripping, but with a strong storyline. Let's see if the film can one up it's past predecessors of the same genre, ""Showgirls"" and ""Striptease,"" and give ""Ted"" a run for it's money for the top spot in the box office.Mike (Channing Tatum) is a 30 year old who wants to start getting his life on track by becoming an entrepreneur and starting his own business. But before that can happen, he works part time at a male strip club and is a number two to his boss Dallas (Matthew McConaughey). Mike then meets Adam (Alex Pettyfer) and takes him under his wing and shows him the lifestyle he lives and all the benefits it can come from it.*I would like to add that I went into this film with an open mind. I was generally interested in seeing it.*Steven Soderbergh direction of this film was great. He used great shots and they were beautiful as well. He really captured the colors of the all the backgrounds during the scenes; typical Soderbergh. He occasionally mixed in some character off-screen dialogue where it would focus on the character that was listening to the other character talk off screen. The choreography of the dancing was great. The dance moves that were being pulled off were impressive. Channing Tatum's performance was not bad. He has been improving with the last couple movies he has been in. McConaughey's performance was classic McConaughey; charming, charismatic and cool. Pettyfer The lead female role (Cody Horn) and love interest of Mike was not the quite good. I really cringed when she got some dialogue. She just didn't fit in. The pacing was slow. The beginning started out so well and then it just got slow.Overall, I didn't enjoy the film. I repeat I went in with an open mind. A lot of its target audience, females, were disappointed walking out of the theater. They were expecting 110 minutes of topless men dancing and they didn't get it. There was more of a story line (which isn't bad, just cliché and not really developed). I couldn't get invested into the movie.2 out of 5 stars.bkstaReviews.blogspot.com",Magic Mike
161,graphicstyle7,"One thing was dead on, the rest is fantasy",7,23 November 2013,"Well, I actually used to live in Tampa only a few years ago. I used to go to Ybor City and get into all sorts of fun mischief as well, so I feel I can speak with some authority when I say part of this movie is dead on, part is just ridiculous Hollywood fiction.The part that's real? All the stuff that happens with sex, drugs, relationships... that's all very on-target and pretty well done. It's actually a bit tame compared to reality. If you want to have a crazy sex life fueled by drugs, this area is pretty much the place to be. I'm nowhere NEAR being a 20-something anymore, and my time as a single was, er, something I don't bring up at a family dinner.I would say, though, that lifestyle is very much due to the fact that I used to live in the Tampa/St. Petersburg area.As for the fantasy part:Well, for starters, you can drive down the main roads of downtown-anywhere in a big U.S. city and see ""Gentlemen's Clubs"". That's probably because men LOVE to look at attractive, naked women.Look for a club like the one they had in ""Magic Mike""? Even in Tampa and Ybor, hey, guess what? You won't find ONE SINGLE ""LADIES"" STRIP CLUB IN THIS ENTIRE AREA. It's just not a thing even wild and crazy Tampa ladies are into. Females just don't seem to be wired like that, or someone would be doing it to make the kind of money ""Gentlemen's Clubs"" make.It's a male, Hollywood fantasy to be nekked and showin' off the goods in front of a bunch of screaming ladies. You pretty much have to be in a rock band for that kind of adulation.Unless you go to ""Gay-bor"" which is the openly and proudly gay section of Ybor. LOTS of that kind of activity going on over there.Which brings me to the second, unrealistic part of the film. What? You can show wild sex and drugs and somehow NONE of those dancers are gay? NO ONE in the audience is a man? REALLY? The last unrealistic thing actually really annoyed me more than the rest. The LAST HURRICANE that hit this part of Florida WAS IN 1921. Yep, almost 100 years ago. This part of the state is blessed to be out of a normal hurricane's path, thank God. And yet they kept referring to objects ""Washed up by the hurricane"" and then had a ""hurricane party"" during a ""hurricane"".I doubt if the makers of this film have ever been through a hurricane of any strength. Even a tropical depression, the weakest form of hurricanes, can put a city down for a week. There is no power, and it's hard to get out and around.An ACTUAL hurricane is scary as hell to sit through. Even a weak one will, without fail, knock out your power and beat up the area to the point that it takes a month or two to get back to normal. The brief radar shot they had on TV in the film would of messed up the character's lives for a while, not just been a backdrop for a party.That's the fantasy part here. LOL. Otherwise, some really nice performances of a fairly goofy script. I think I would of liked this very unique section of our country represented in a more gritty style. I miss the 1970's when movies took chances and didn't always have to have a happy, shiny ending. It would of been a LOT more interesting picture to go to some of Ybor's actual night clubs, The Castle for example, one of the biggest Goth clubs in the country. Basing the film on the crazy party/drugs/sex scene in Ybor would of been quite a bit more compelling than showing a business that does not even exist here.",Magic Mike
162,veeckasinwreck,More than skin deep,8,22 July 2012,"I'm not the demographic associated with this film's audience, but I was pretty sure my wife would enjoy it. I ended up very impressed with it as well. Soderbergh, as always is very good at what he does. The stripper scenes have a palpable, toxic energy, and he has not lost his knack for highlighting the exact detail in the frame that truly tells the story. The acting is extraordinary across the board, and in a real upset, the most interesting character is a woman. Cody Horn is transcendentally beautiful, and her attraction to Magic Mike, an attraction that she strives to will out of existence, is utterly compelling. At heart this movie is their love story, and the end is not entirely satisfactory; it is at once too pat and yet leaves too many loose ends. Still, it is without question one of the better films I have seen in some time.",Magic Mike

I think the trailer gave the best bits of the film, the creepiest person was Dallas who I could make up my mind on his sexuality but either way he was greasier than a snake-oil salesman and the only response he raised in me was shudders. CT might have a decent body, but his presentation was listless, mumbled and generally bored me to tears. The storyline didn't exist, what was there didn't really follow.I think they tried to combine two good movies (Flashdance and the Full Monty) and failed badly.

But anyways, Magic Mike is not perfect but worth a watch as its properly produced, directed and performed by its good cast. At the end of the day (or should i say, at the end of the movie), its a great love story. Cody Horn is great. Her facial expressions (namely those shocked looks) is perfect when the strippers took to stage. It expresses the film like no one can. No words can describe it. The eyes spoke louder than words.

165,HollywoodAlicia,A must see for single women EVERYWHERE!,9,8 August 2012,"I went to see 'Magic Mike' for the obvious reasons — Channing Tatum and Matthew McConaughey. I just expected a good time: sex, stripping, the whole shebang. I don't know why but I didn't really expect that there would be a plot. Maybe I was just to caught up in the men, I don't know what happened. My point is: the plot was very good. You went into the underground world of male stripping. And let me tell you, it is not pretty. Alex Pettyfer played the newbie who got a little too carried away with his line of work. We're talking parties, drugs, women. Some of his scenes made my stomach churn. I thought the acting was good. Cody Horn, who played The Kid's sister didn't show any emotion, which was the only thing that irked me, other than that– nothing special. The directing was fabulous. Steven Soderbergh knew to get all the right angles. *wink, wink*.",Magic Mike
166,happycatpaws,"Stupid, boring, waste of time",2,16 May 2013,"When watching this movie, I couldn't help to wonder why, with so many fantastic novels and stories out there, huge sums of money are wasted on pointless tripe as this. The novelty of the movie for those of us who do not frequent strip clubs, is to have a peek into the world of what happens there. Overgrown ""boys"" strutting around in costumes and endlessly dry humping for the audience, showing off their wares, as though somehow seeing their abs and behinds were the greatest thrill in the world for the, of course, sex starved women in their audience, who stuffed their undies with dollar bills while they shrieked with delight. Whoo-hooo! A pointless storyline peppered with F this and F that, a few female body parts thrown in. Yawn, yawn... If you have nothing to do with your time, check this movie out, or you could be as entertained watching the dust collect on your windowsill.",Magic Mike
167,jordangross,NO EHAT IT SEEM! Which is a good thing.,7,30 June 2012,"Men, don't be discouraged from this movie, the trailers make it out to seem like a full on male stripper movie, but that's only to bring in the female audience. Honestly the stripping scenes in the movie are so minimal, that any kind of job could have taken its place. The drama, and surprisingly comedy, take over this movie completely. Each character was so well developed that I wanted to know more and more about each individual person in the film.This film stars Channing Tatum (21 Jump Street, Dear John), Alex Pettyfer (I Am Number Four, Beastly), Olivia Munn (Iron Man 2, Attack of the Show), Matthew McConaughey (The Lincoln Lawyer, U-571), Matt Bomer (In Time, White Collar), and Gabriel Iglesias (Comedian).In Magic Mike, Mike (Channing Tatum) takes a younger person, Adam (Alex Pettyfer), under his wing and teaches him the way to make easy money, pick up chicks, and have a great time. The only reason why Mike actually does stripping is so that he can save a bunch of money and do what he really loves. With a bunch of set backs and drama related issues in his way while teaching Adam, the movie keeps you entertained from start to finish.The performances in this movie were down right amazing. Channing Tatum has lately just getting better and better with every film that he has been in. His character in this film is so deep and interesting that you can't help but want to know more about him. I can mainly say that for all the actors as well because every character is so well developed and so deep that you really get invested into this movie. This is hands down one of my favorite films this year. Steven Soberbergh is such a great director, making yet another masterpiece.Rating: 8/10 Thank you for reading my review, any feedback is greatly appreciated!",Magic Mike
168,anoukandre,"Such a complicated subject, such a graceful and touching movie",10,22 October 2016,"Wow - as I was watching the movie, I had the feeling of a miracle unfolding in front of my eyes. A movie about male sex workers that depicts the profession, the performers, the audience and relationships in a serious, respectful, realistic and non-judgmental way? Well written dialogues, quite original issues, an all-to realistic plot, good acting, a teenager that is actually as awkward and stupid as most teenagers are (despite being smoking hot)?A movie that actually avoids objectification, clichés, plot twists and lazy written endings?And a movie that includes incredible dancing, top notch stage performances, a bunch of incredibly hot guys, and doesn't leave me drooling (much) but rather in awe for the whole stripping business?Every single character, be they male or female, multi-dimensional, complex and well-written?Yes, such a gem does exist out there in the world. And it's Magik Mike. I'm so happy it exists, and it leaves me hoping for more movies of that intensity, depth and compassion. Kind of film that makes the world a bit brighter. Go see it!",Magic Mike
169,Lavender81,"Rather bland, but great dancing",5,17 February 2019,It's a pretty bland film overall if I'm honest.Worth scrolling through to watch the dance bits though! Changing Tatum's rendition to 'Pony' by Ginuwine is certainly an experience.,Magic Mike
170,abundidi1184,Liked it better than I thought,7,2 June 2013,"I'm 64 years old, and thought that I wouldn't like the film. Reason being; I thought my stripper watching days were over 20 years ago. I was right, they were! But the movie had substance, and I found myself being drawn in by the brilliant character development this movie provided. First, Dallas. Matthew McConaughey was perfect as the sleazy 40 something stripper who seduces his protégés as skillfully as he seduces the crowd at the club. Secondly, Mike. Channing Tatum, ""killed"" with his bravura performance as the star dancer on stage, and the ""sensitive"" entrepreneur off stage. Thirdly,Adam, the kid's character was exhibited in his first scene, when he quit his job at the construction site, and drifted into stripping later that night. His sister summed him up when she said, ""He had a football scholarship which he lost when he hit the coach the first day."" His dabbling in drugs, showed a young ""loser in training"". Alex Pettyfer played the character just right. At first green, and then, tepidly a want-a-be, looking for love. What the film showed was the beginning of his down-slide, not the inevitable end of it. Brilliant! The women were perfect backdrops for these men's characters. The down- to-earth concerned sister. The intelligent, upwardly mobile girlfriend. The druggie ""freak"" with the pet pig. Even the manager at the bank. This small role was performed wonderfully. She was obviously effected by the attractiveness and sexiness of Magic Mike, but she didn't let that deter her from her job to properly assess Mike's suitability for a loan. Great! Realistic, and so unpredictable. I think that was when I began to really pay attention to the movie as something of substance. The stripping scenes were okay. I could have done without so many of them, but, as I said, I'm 64. The best was Mike's final ""F You!"" dance. That was hot! All in all, great movie that avoided most of the tired ""good guy goes bad"" predictability. See it.",Magic Mike
171,TypedbyTara,"Ladies, this ones for you.",6,11 July 2012,"Magic Mike is a movie that details the events in a life of a 30 year old stripper, Mike (Channing Tatum). Right off the bat, there are two things that should pop out. Channing Tatum, and Stripper. For those of you who are male, or living under a rock for the past decade, Channing Tatum is the quintessential sex symbol for all living, breathing, women. In other words, Channing Tatum is to ladies as Megan Fox or Olivia Wilde is to fellas.So it is instantly recognized that this movie targets women ages 17 (R-rating) and up. It's also pretty obvious that the only reason that hoards of ladies will see this movie is to get a glimpse of Channing Tatum at his finest. Magic Mike gives the crowd exactly what they asked for. The movie is loaded with sizzling hot dance scenes, half-naked male-strippers, and the occasional glance of Tatum's Tushie. Being a teenage girl myself I must say, the movie was not lacking in the visual stimulation department. However, the other aspects of the movie fell a bit flat. To the actors/actresses credit, the acting was solid. Alex Pettyfer did a great job of portraying a self-centered, careless ""kid"". While Cody Horn, was his convincing opposite, playing the protective, reserved sister. The one thing the movie lacked was a great plot. Honestly, I didn't go into the movie expecting it to have an award winning story line, but that's just me. When there wasn't dancing/stripping scenes, the movie was slow and slightly boring. However, all of this can be forgiven when you look at the big picture. Magic Mike promised a fun time for all those (women) who saw it, even the tagline ""You Wish You Were Single"" peaks your interest. Magic Mike is a breath of fresh air, that, in an industry driven by male fantasy, finally gives the ladies a bit of eye candy they deserve.",Magic Mike
172,hamidnoori03,Very surprisingly an OK movie...,5,29 December 2015,"The movie starts off very good and carries on the road OK, but the question we need to ask ourselves is if the concept of the movie worth the great zeal?? The concept is simple and it is more like other movies...a guy wants to be rich, but needs to struggle to get rich through stripping. This concept is very simple and a bit interesting, but if you want your movie to be good you need a good ending which in this movie is very unmeaningful and does not satisfy its audience. When I first started watching the movie I was assuming that I would give it a 2/10, but it surprised me and made me give it a 5/10. I wont recommend you to watch it, but i wont tell you to not watch it.",Magic Mike

I've seen Chippendales here in Tampa a few times, always well trained professionals, nothing like this movie. Group dancers in Magic Mike didn't even appear to bother practicing before performing, could not keep step or move together. NOT attractive. Matthew M. and Joe M. did demonstrate sensual performances with some good moves but Tatum was clumsy at every turn, a definitive turn OFF. POORLY done! Men may like this. As a woman I did not.",Magic Mike
174,asleep_soon,I enjoyed it for the story,9,16 July 2015,"I only watched Magic Mike after I found it on demand. I thought I would probably watch it for five minutes, then get bored and turn it off. But the story hooked me immediately. I especially enjoyed that we got a realistic view of a male stripper, behind the scenes. I haven't watched the sequel because reviews tell me there is a greater focus on stripping. I guess the negative criticism from the first movie was an influence on the second movie, and I wish it hadn't been. Magic Mike is one of the best independent movies I've seen in a long time. I found it engaging, and I sympathized with the characters. I hate that it was marketed as sexy movie about male strippers, because it drew the wrong audience. This movie was so much more than that.",Magic Mike
175,lui-samantha,Magic Mike is more than just a sexy striptease,7,14 July 2012,"A story about male strippers featuring the likes of Channing Tatum, Alex Pettyfer and Matthew McConaughey is sure to rack up millions at the box office. But considering the fact that this dramedy was backed by an Academy Award-winning director, Magic Mike is more than just thongs, dollar bills, screaming women and sensuous grinding.Directed by Steven Soderburgh (who won the Oscar for his work on Traffic), it's a film that deals with the deeper themes of life such as self-destruction, aging, ambition and a bit of romance as well.In the film, Pettyfer plays Adam, a college-dropout who's staying with his older sister Brooke (Cody Horn) until he can figure out what he wants to do with his life. After getting hired for a construction job, he's soon taken under the wing of Mike (Tatum), a fellow roof tiler who spends his nights dancing in Tampa's Xquisite nightclub as a stripper.After a night of partying, Adam is soon recruited to join Mike and his colleagues Big Dick Richie (Joe Manganiello), Tito (Adam Rodriguez), Ken (Matt Bomer) and Tarzan (Kevin Nash) to perform sexy strip routines every night. And soon enough, he's immersed in a world full of drugs, sex, women and alcohol.Mike on the other hand, craves for more despite making a profitable income as a stripper. He yearns for a relationship with someone he can sit down and have a conversation with. But instead, he's reduced to one- night-stands with his booty call Joanna (Olivia Munn).Job wise, he aspires to start a custom furniture business but struggles to lift off his career as an entrepreneur. But while he lacks intelligence as a business man, he's smart enough to see how the stripping industry can change a person as they get older. As club owner Dallas (played excellently by McConaughey) proves, the career can turn you into a selfish and conceited individual.Written by Reid Carolin (Tatum's screen writing partner), Magic Mike is less about the stripping and more about the lifestyles of male strippers. Inspired by Tatum's own experiences as a young erotic dancer in Florida, the script perfectly balances between humour and drama while successfully capturing the repercussions and challenges that come with the profession (i.e drugs, self-destruction and vanity).However, that's not to say the film doesn't have its fun and raunchy dance routines. With choreography provided by Alison Faulk, many of the dances are a little more embarrassing than sexy (with the exception of Tatum's hot strip-show number to Ginuwine's ""Pony"").Acting wise, the one who steals the show is McConaughey, who perfectly and hilariously portrays the sleazy, skin-tight-leather-wearing Dallas. Tatum and Pettyfer on the other hand, hold their own despite sounding a bit rigid and unnatural at times. And with Horn well-casted for the role of Adam's concerned sister Brooke, it's just too bad the other actors such as Bomer, Rodriguez, Manganiello and Nash are left in the background dancing and grinding with not much to say.While Magic Mike never offers full-on nudity as many would expect, Soderburgh's natural and well-paced direction provides an honest story about male strippers.And whether or not you came to see the film for the chiseled bodies, this tale might just leave you with a different outlook on what it would be like to live as an erotic dancer.",Magic Mike
176,durur6,110 minutes of your life you will regret losing.,2,23 October 2012,I don't know how these movies get made. I know that not all movies are going to be edifying or eventful. Most are a meaningless waste of time with little benefit except escape. This was so predictable it was pitiful. The only reason I even watched it was I do like Channing Tatum. I honestly think he has potential to be a very good actor. He just needs to find the right vehicle. This wasn't it. The production design was nonexistent. The wardrobe was what exactly. I don't know. The camera work was like a 1st year film student in a Midwestern community college. There was nothing in this film to make me care about a single character it contained. If you want to get a tease from a few guys with very nice bodies wearing more than you can see on some beaches. Go ahead.,Magic Mike
177,natneg84-890-882340,"Misogynist, cliché and shallow",1,6 January 2014,"For a serious actor like Tatum this was such a disappointment. The stripping show was good artistically but I would rather see him in a regular dancing role like before rather than see him rub his crotch in girl's faces! Media has been driving people's reactions and how to think. If girls were to follow this where are we going? It is fun to look at guys but let's face it...girls unlike guys don't want to touch, or at least not in that pathetic desperate way! Girls are the preys and guys the hunters! We have gone far from the classic gentlemen opening the door for a lady or kissing their hands before a dance. I am not saying we should go back to this period since it is over but let's not go as far as portraying girls as those hungry man-eaters! That was such a degrading portrayal of women, as if women desire men much more than the opposite! In short this was a distortion of reality; solely a sexist fantasy from men who disrespect women. For people who think I might be taking this too seriously wait until your daughter, sister or cousin starts acting like those poor low self-esteem girls in this movie and you might start to understand the gravity of the situation. I would rather pay to watch a Broadway show rather than over-confident blaze men strip with good moves!",Magic Mike
178,OrsonLannister,"Schizophrenic: Why ""Magic Mike"" doesn't work",4,30 June 2012,"As I watched ""Magic Mike"", I was entertained and hopeful. Some of its elements were fascinating and the storyline seemed to be heading in an interesting direction. Each new scene seemed to lead toward a climax that could make the movie's run time worthwhile.And then it ended.I was confused. So many things didn't make sense. So many questions were left unanswered. Where was the conflict's resolution? What happened to Adam? When did Mike and Brooke fall in love? What was with Tarzan's character? Did I have the wrong mindset? The problem with ""Magic Mike"" is that it attempts to appeal to every form of movie watcher and, instead, appeals only to the ladies fanning themselves while mesmerized by abs and biceps. While Mike (a surprisingly decent Channing Tatum) is an interesting character, the movie's structure and story suffer from Steven Soderbergh's direction.1. ""Magic Mike"" has no goal. No themes, no morals, no bottom-line. We see hints of anti-drug sentimentality, and Soderbergh draws a little attention to the effects of the male stripper world on the male mind. But these elements are only hints, and are abandoned by the time the credits roll. Mike doesn't regret his actions as a stripper, only that he continued to be one into his 30's. He dabbles in drugs in one (hyper-extended and annoying) montage-esque scene, but that event too has few direct consequences.All this would be okay if the movie was a comedy. However...2. ""Magic Mike"" isn't funny. Not by any stretch of the imagination. We have some witty remarks that are bound to induce some smiles, but the only laughs come from people's ""shock"" from the dance numbers. There are no jokes, no slapstick humor, and the dance numbers really aren't that amusing (to a male). The only truly funny scene is when Adam (a bored looking Alex Pettyfer) is first backstage with Tarzan and the other strippers.If this movie lacks a drama's thematic elements and a comedy's laughs, then it must be a romance, right?3. ""Magic Mike"" isn't romantic. In fact, Mike and Brooke (Cody Horn) don't let any sparks fly at all. A relationship between the two isn't even a possibility until they get into their first shouting match, near (what I assume to be) the movie's climax. Their relationship is never given time to grow because the movie's first half tries to build a story around Adam and Mike's relationship. However, the second half drops Adam almost completely and attempts to bring in Brooke. Both relationships fall flat, not to mention Adam ends up as a terrible human being.In the end, what the audience gets is a casserole of movie elements and little of the satisfaction that comes from watching these types of movies because Soderbergh shoots high and misses everything. Also, ""Magic Mike"" is peppered with extended ""erotic"" dance numbers that add nothing to the plot and exist purely to satisfy the target audience: middle-aged women. These scenes, in addition to the movie's schizophrenic lack of direction, will disappoint any movie lover's hopes of seeing a film that provides insight into the mind of a male stripper.At least, the audience could have used a decent ending.",Magic Mike
179,legra66,Oh dear!!,1,8 February 2015,"I saw the film for the first time on TV yesterday and was truly shocked, especially, after all the hype over the years. What was equally more shocking was seeing Matthew and Adam Rodriguez being a part of this. There was no clear story line and all the stripping, well, did not do it for me and I am guessing that was the reason the film did so well as women will pay for anything with good looking men in it good or bad as in this case. Channing is a dancer and not an actor in my opinion as he always comes across as too wooden. Besides the odd quips from McConnaughey, rest of the cast were also wooden and even more so with Olivia's character, boy was she wooden. Had to stop watching mid-way as it made no sense!! There are so many great actors out there and studios should move away from the lazy business model of using non actors or people who cannot act but good looking as this formula gets old very quickly.",Magic Mike

While this is blatantly a vehicle to show of Tatum's dancing skills and also one obviously geared to bring legions of female fans for each respective Hollywood stud and the removal of their clothes, it is still an interesting film worthy of staying till the end credits. It is well acted by all concerned - there is an almost ad-lib quality to some of the dialogue, frantic exchanges often overlapping each other, lending an aspect of realism to the whole piece.It's not going to win any Oscars, but it certainly surprised me with how engaging it actually was. A film not be taken at face value...",Magic Mike
182,tinseltine,Channing Tatum is smarter and more talented than his close-set eyes imply,5,4 August 2012,"Steven Soderbergh is an impressive director - Traffic, Erin Brockovich, Ocean's Eleven Trilogy, Contagion and many more, but his last movie Haywire didn't seem to be up to his usual standard. Now, he's redeemed himself for me with Magic Mike.Based on the real-life pre-acting career of star Channing Tatum, this behind the scenes look at male stripping is not only entertaining, sexy and fun; it's got more quality and a hipper flavor than the trailer would have you believe.   Tatum's character Mike is ambitious in that cocksure way some young guys have of running a lot of hustles, determined to get somewhere, able to party hard and still keep an eye on the ball, all the while, underneath, actually feeling lost.British newcomer with a flawless American accent, Alex Pettyfer, plays Adam, who has ""rules"" and keeping to these rules have landed him broke and on his sister's couch. He and female newcomer, Cody Horn, have a good, believable chemistry as brother and sisters.  You definitely get the impression they've been on their own for sometime and she's used to playing big sister, even though they're close in age.   One of Mike's daytime gigs is construction, where he meets Adam and takes ""The Kid"" under his wing, getting him a job at Xquisite, a male revue night club, as a props guy. Adam's introduction to the other male dancers and their world of thongs, spray tans and male enhancement paraphernalia is hilarious! This is where the focus of the film is kept and rightly so; not only is Tatum an unbelievably genius hip hop stripper, but all the stage scenes and stripper/customer interactions are good, funny and hot! And then there's McConaughey, I believe Matthew McConaughey would have done this role without getting paid. Magic Mike sets a tone which is able to successfully blend song, dance romance and plot without being the least bit corny. It's exactly what I believe the movies Burlesque and Rock of Ages were aiming to do, but failed miserably. I'm looking forward to checking out Anna Kendrick in Pitch Perfect to see how they handle this mix of elements.",Magic Mike
183,mjp0117-26-143834,Exactly as expected.,8,18 July 2012,"For those of you are posting negative reviews...I'm not sure what you expected here. It's a film about strippers. In fact, I could care less if there was no plot (which there wasn't). In fact, I'd rather a superficial plot so I wouldn't be distracted by the awesomeness that is Channing Tatum. The movie was fun and predictable...not too serious but not embarrassingly raunchy and even skipped the happy ending that tied together all loose ends. I appreciated the fact that it did not pretend to be something it is not. Most characters lacked any depth, except for Mike, who while played solidly by Tatum, was predictable. Nonetheless, he made you want to be his next conquest a million times over. No other character made you feel much--even the other leads. But I did not go see this film to be emotionally invested.The other strippers could have been hotter. The newcomer, 'The Kid' was young and cute and the others were a little creepy--but aren't most male strippers? Matthew McConaughey was pervy and creepy and funny. Have fun watching this film...go with your girlfriends and catcall the screen. It's worth seeing Tatum's butt on the big screen--just don't expect an Oscar winner.",Magic Mike
184,nikki_kdodd,Not what I was expecting...,3,12 July 2012,"I am the first to admit, I went to see this as the trailer portrayed it as a funny chick flick! Therefore this seemed like the ideal film to go and see with the girls and have a bit of a laugh. I was sorely disappointed...Having said that, I also like a film with substance but this was incredibly dull. The lead actress, Cody Horn, was shocking! One expression the entire film (miserable) and no acting skills to speak of. She had zero chemistry with Channing Tatum and the idea that his character would fall for her is completely unbelievable. This was more about the seedy side of stripping, which would have been fine if thats what it had been portrayed as in the trailer.The strip scenes were OK, and the dancing was good at times, but I found the swearing very abrasive as it was every other word just for the sake of it. None of the characters were particularly likable, apart from Mike. The whole storyline of Alex Pettyfer's character being pulled into drugs was taken nowhere really, we don't know what happened to him apart from that he became the ""number one"" when Mike quit... I was expecting there to be some kind of inevitable overdose from all the drugs or some kind of repurcussions from the liifestyle he was dragged into, but there was nothing at all, and the ending was rubbish.Basically it was a complete let down.

186,linguacrobat,Somebody owed somebody a favour?,3,30 November 2012,"While watching this strange, strange film I kept racking my brain to see if I could recall any news items about Steven Soderbergh having been saved from near-certain death by any screenwriters. I could not and Google searches also failed to turn anything up. Which is weird, because why else would one of our great film directors choose to turn this absurd script into a feature film? I cannot for the life of me understand what other reason there could have been to make this movie, other than somebody owing an absolutely massive favour to somebody else. First of all, the initial premise is unworkable and thus the film dies and loses all credibility within the first 15 minutes. Why? Because children, listen closely to your wise ole granny when she tells you this pearl of unchanging wisdom: aging strippers are not in the business of recruiting their own replacements! Whether male or female, getting old is the biggest fear in the adult industries and thus the young and new are the enemy of the old and experienced. When a new stripper joins the team, they would be perceived as a huge threat to earnings. This is a tip-based business don't forget, and there would be absolutely no perceived advantage to any of the old-timers to bring in a hot new guy. No way. They don't share the tips, they are competing for them. Also, the dancers pay for stage time and not the other way around! Why was the owner giving the dancers $50 each after their shift. This is not how it works. All back-slapping and bear-hugging each other back stage, eh? Wrong! That is not how it works either. Why in hell would Mike suddenly decide to take this guy under his wing? Makes no sense. All it would do is cut into his own earnings. So this totally unreal presentation of a bunch of guy strippers being totally welcoming and developing a new one because ""he got something"" is 100% unbelievable. If Channing Tatum really did work in the adult industry then he should know that! In that environment, your co-workers are not your friends, they are your competition. And as for the club itself. Well we all know that there isn't a place on earth remotely like XQuisite. Though it was interesting to note that women at a male strip show apparently just giggle and shriek at the outlandish fun of it all. The vibe at a female strip club is decidedly darker and less comedic.Finally, maybe the ""writer"" of the script thought he was making a point by gender-role reversing and having the big sister disapprove of her little brother's stripper job and not want to fall for his stripper friend, but personally I never liked the ""quit your adult job to prove you love me"" plot arc when the genders were the other way around. One half of the couple still had to change themselves to please the other, who did no transforming at all, which is a terrible message to transmit.It testifies to Soderbergh's amazing skills as a director that despite the howler dialogue he managed to eke out some naturalistic performances from the cast (with the exception of Matthew McConnaughy whose portrayal is an OTT parody of a satire of a spoof) and that although it didn't take long to realize the film was ridiculous, I still watched it to the end with mild interest. 1 of the 3 points I give this film is just for the lighting.",Magic Mike
187,joannefilm2014,Sweet? movie about male strippers,8,12 July 2012,"Ever since I first heard that Steven Soderbergh was making a film about male strippers, I knew I had to see it. I prepared for the experience by watching Tatum Channing in a movie he made a few years ago, and had to lower my expectations in a hurry.Magic Mike is such a happy, joyous film that it's hard to believe it's a Soderbergh piece, but there are definitely truly cinematic moments. However, the entire film has a Hollywood glitz shimmering over the entire sordid world of stripping, drug dealing, booze and floozies. In fact, the director's main achievement may be the deft ability to bring glamour to this dark world. Atom Egoyan's Exotica this is not.But what I enjoyed the most about the film was the excellent acting. Tatum Channing was not only funny, smart, and an entirely winning screen presence, but he was also required to be multi-faceted and have some depth. He handled it really well. Matthew McConaughey is one of my least favorite actors, but he completely destroyed my low opinion of him with his great performance as the aging stripper who still has more chops than his younger employees.

They bring up a number of issues like drug problems, moving to Miami, relationship desires and business opportunities ... all of which never come to a conclusion and are more 'mentioned' rather than choosing one dilemma to focuss on and use for an actual plot.

190,georgiasunflower,Magic Mike,4,6 February 2013,"FIrst of all I'll Say SPOILER ALERT just in case, but in all honesty, there is no way I could give you a spoiler alert because there simply was NO story to spoil! Big surprise gorgeous men strip - end of story. I usually really like Channing Tatum and of course I adore Joe Manganiello!! BUT there was nothing to this movie other than some guys stripping. The only one who I felt did a so so job acting was Channing. Joe was HOT, but he had no storyline, Alex looked awful, Matthew was way to over the top and I felt the dialog between Mike and Paige was forced. IF you want to see this movie, watch it with no sound. At least then you can try to fill in something good. I can only assume the reason this movie got any good reviews at all is because women enjoy watching the above mentioned hotties take off their clothes. And I get that, really I do, but it just wasn't enough. Magic Mike (Channing) does have some incredible moves. He is an amazing dancer, but there was NO storyline. Half the time I wasn't sure who was hooking up with who, nor was I really sure Mike was interested in Paige until much later in the movie.",Magic Mike
191,srichdway-1,The only magic here is Matthew McConaughey's performance!,5,9 September 2012,"Magic Mike is like one of those old fashioned Hollywood morality movies from the early 1930's. The movie titillates you for the first 30 minutes, then shames you for the remainder for ever liking those 'wicked, wicked male strippers!' This movie could have been edited down into something entertaining and fast paced ( like its trailer! ) Instead Magic Mike drones on and on like a morality lecture at a Baptist revival. The movie is ""Scared Straight"" for the sex entertainment industry. This alone might make it a useful life lesson movie for youngsters, if - IF it were not for the extensive on-screen nudity, sex, and drug use! Though Channing Tatum does fine work as the conflicted hero, Matthew McConaughey absolutely steals the movie as his sleazy, unconflicted boss and mentor. Mr. McConaughey's performance is a revelation, and deserves at least an Oscar nomination.",Magic Mike
192,flamegamehunter,"Good movie, but one thing kept ruining it.",6,28 June 2012,"I work at a movie theatre that housed this film. Out of sheer curiosity, I went to a late night employee showing of this movie. I had no expectations other than: ""It's a movie about a bunch of male strippers. Channing Tatum is in it."" I went in expecting just that and got a bit more than I expected. Big spoiler: There's a bunch of guy's asses thrown about the stage while Matthew McConaughey, the owner of the male strip club, flaunts his 'I'm-better-than-you'-ness to all of the screaming women that go to these events. I had fun watching the women's reactions and seeing how it all works back stage, and McConaughey and Tatum play their roles quite well. There is good tension, humor, drama, and it was very entertaining. One thing kept ruining it for me. Cody Horn plays the sister of the new guy to the club, and main focus of the story, Adam (Alex Pettyfer). It was painful watching her forced emotions and hearing her fake laughs while seeing her awful timing ruin a lot of the immersion I thought I was having during the movie. Tatum's character, unfortunately, develops a love interest as absolutely painfully as possible. He went from the gorgeous and goofy Olivia Munn to a very uptight, unpleasant, downright cardboard-cutout overprotective-big-sister. By this, I mean, she never smiled during the entire movie, her lines sounded like they were read through a Microsoft-speak program, and she showed no interest whatsoever to the possibility of a relationship until the last five minutes of the movie. And even then, the wordplay is painful at best as she waits for an awkward thirty second before lunging onto Tatum in cliché 'credits-roll' romanticism.Overall, I did enjoy the movie. I didn't expect to, so that is good on the movie's part. To describe the experience, however, imagine this: You have a plate of food in front of you. There's everything you like on it cooked very well, but right on the edge of the plate is a tiny piece of feces. You can enjoy the meal however you want, but the experience is lessened as you try to figure out why that crap was put on your plate in the first place.",Magic Mike

It's not for anyone.The only saving grace is the fact Tatum Channing can dance. That's it. He has earned an entire one of my two stars.Matthew McConahay, I'm assuming, took the role to show off his despite-my-age body and brag about it. Kudos, now please get off my screen. Every time he opened his mouth it was like nails on a chalkboard.The worst acting was done by Cody Horn. Once I read her bio I understood how she got the role and why she was the only woman to not show her boobs. Thanks dad! This story line was as thin as the paper the script was written on. And I use the term written loosely, as the dialog was so lacking it would have been better released as a silent film. That way the blah-blah-blah wouldn't have detracted from the shaved and oiled bodies.The end of this cinematic achievement was as unsatisfying as a legal lap dance.",Magic Mike
194,NatNeg84,Misogynistic and shallow,1,11 January 2014,"I expected so much from this movie based on Tatum! Nothing but a selfish men's fantasy with girls ready to offer and give without receiving anything back! There was a lot of men shoving their crotches at girls' faces which is not something i expected Tatum to choose as a character. This depicted beautiful girls with low-self esteem, desperate to ""touch!!"" and do much more degrading stuff. If one day your daughter or sister ends up acting so desperately with no self-respect then you know somewhere along the lines media has been teaching your children more than you have taught them. As a young adult and mother-to-be this is not the kind of movie I would want my children to grow up with; not with that mentality of how women are treated, how 21 year old girls just ""give BJs"" in bars to a stranger in front of anyone and much worse that this movie depicted. Yuck! This does not represent the American culture and when it is put on film & distributed internationally there is denying when people around the world denigrate us for our obscenities and lack of morale. This could be as well pornography with blurred intimate parts but with all the intended dirty meaning! i am not saying this despondence is new to cinematography but when a well respected actor starts doing a movie like this people get the wrong kind of message about what is morally right or wrong.

It has a great cast, but that is it, 90 minutes of hot guys stripping and dancing. It lacks of plot, the whole movie you are waiting for the big thing to happen but truly, nothing ever happen. On the other side the art direction isn't good at all. The lighting, the camera angles, all of it is simple and boring.

199,Elinix,Not the kind of magic you expect,9,13 August 2014,"This is by far the best film I have seen this year.Now, I get that it is not everyones cup of tea, but it shouldn't be, and I'm so glad it didn't try for that. This film was made for me, and everyone like me who appreciates the long takes, the beautiful yellow light, the richness of details and the sense that anytime now everything that is great can turn to ashes, and when it does the characters will have no idea how it happened. It is a film full of natural dialog and little moments of clever editing, like the silence on the bridge as the sun rises, broken by a splash of water, the cut away from preparing a performance to the dressing room after and the repeated cut to a sign spelling out the months of the summer the movie takes place during.It also does not shy away from it's core subject, objectification and sexualisation of human bodies, and what it does to the individuals that inhabit those bodies. The character Mike is unusual in so many ways, but what stands out to me the most is that his vulnerability takes him by surprise. As a man, he believes he can't get hurt by what he does, he really believes that, and his stumbling realization that to others it's not just something he does, it's something he is, that moment is unique.I will also point out that the casting is extraordinary. Every little supporting role makes a rich whole and they are all a perfect fit.All in all, if you don't think you will like this movie, then you probably won't, but if you think it might be alright chances are you will be just as pleasantly surprised as I was.",Magic Mike
200,JadeIslandReviews,Magic Mike: Needed More Magic and Less Mike,3,15 July 2012,"Magic Mike is one of those many films that I could guess the plot exactly before I saw it. I don't know if its because its super predictable or if I've seen too many movies. Anyways, here is how I predicted how the film would go down before I saw it: Popular guy with pretty good life turns into a Disney princess because he wants ""something more"" in his life than what he's use to. He meets girl, falls in love with girl but is torn between his life and girl. He (shockingly) picks girl with limited personality instead of pretty good life and they all live happily ever after. That was my prediction BEFORE I saw the movie.I won't spoiler the actual film but here's what its about: Magic Mike (Channing Tatum) is a construction worker by day and male stripper by night. He meets pretty boy Adam (Alex Pettyfer) who lives with his sister, Brooke (Cody Horn) at work and gets Adam a stripping job at the strip joint owned by Dallas (""I see a lot of law breakers""...must a say HIS name?). Romantic fireworks explode between characters and Adam gets into trouble along the way.Here's how I'm going to analyze: Story: All I can about the story is that it is your typical romantic 21st century Hollywood film. You can predict the whole movie and ending very easily.Characters: These characters were walking cardboards. Mike, Adam, Brooke, Joanna, Norah, even Tarzan, etc HAD NO PERSONALITY! The character that was somewhat interesting was Dallas and he stripped the least (sorry ladies). I could've cared less what happened to these characters because there was no depth to them and I didn't feel attached to them at all. We've seen these clichéd characters a million times.Acting: I hated to judge this part because there isn't much to judge. The acting is...mediocre at best. Channing Tatum plays the role he plays in every film of his: the good guy with little personality. I feel Tatum CAN really act but he needs to expand his range like Johnny Depp does or Heath Ledger use to. Adam Pettyfer has tried to expand his range (like in ""Beastly"")but the kid, as good looking as he is, just can't act. Cody Horn was the weakest link. She'll probably be the next Julia Stiles, meaning she'll be cast in the same role in every film (good films probably) next to good looking guys even though she can't act.These are the only things to critique on. The directing, music, editing, etc are not focused on at all. The only song in the film I could remember was ""Its Raining Men"". The directing had some shaky camera. I remember that. The visuals were...okay. If you like naked men.Overall, the film was...""eh"". I was bored through most of it and I left the theater with no intentions to ever see it again. I gave the film three stars out of ten. The film needed more ""magic"" in storytelling and originality then ""Mike"" just being your typical Hollywood dream guy that doesn't really exist.",Magic Mike
201,perpetuallybadhaircut,"Misleading Promotion, But All In All, Not A Terrible Movie",7,4 July 2012,"Here, we have more of an appeal for preference. Channing Tatum fans will go because they enjoy Channing Tatum and think he's charming and attractive and what not. I am not one of those people. I sat through ""Magic Mike"" telling myself that he was such a bad actor, but over the course of the past days I thought to myself that his character, Mike, is actually a perfect representation of the male stripper. He's the charming lady's man who thinks he's a hot shot, God-bodied stud, who often comes across as a douchebag to some, I'd assume. I just wasn't thinking clearly about it while watching the movie. Tatum actually does do a good job as an actor in this film, if you can look past his douchey exterior, because he's playing the honest male you'd expect to see strip. The whole representation of the film that I had in mind was a comedy/drama with Tatum, Matthew McConaughey, some Matt Bomer and Joe Manganiello, and a little with Alex Pettyfer. That's what the multiple interviews, magazine covers, and trailers had me believe. It turned out to be Tatum and Pettyfer basically acting as lead protagonists while Cody Horn (who gracefully uses this performance to add the heart the movie lacked) and McConaughey used their supporting roles to bend the two leads' story lines in opposite directions. It seems that Matt Bomer and Joe Manganiello were there only to provide a familiar face and possibly widen the audience's range. I cannot even recall a speaking part that Manganiello even had, yet he won the recognition over Pettyfer. The movie is less about stripping, and surprising to be more about drug abuse, which is another misleading thing about the promotions. They in no way pointed out there was even a whiff of drugs involved in this movie, certainly not with Pettyfer's character. The performances are as genuine as they need to be, but at some times become droll and stiff. Tatum handles his character with a gangster-esque body language and white trash charm that seems to keep most of the audience interested. His dance scenes (and boy are there A LOT of dance scenes) are fun to watch, and very convincing to the whole stripper- vibe he's trying to sell. Pettyfer is the better of the two, he's more relaxed and less over-bearing than Tatum, although the baggage his character brings to the movie is handled with less acting than it probably should. McConaughey really shines, and has already received pretty wide acclaim for this role. His character is so enthralling, so charismatic and sexual, he literally draws you in. When you finally do see him dance it's mind-blowing. It seems as though this role was made especially for him, he gives that cynical crooked-boss edge to the film that's arresting when he's on-screen. I wish Bomer would've gotten a bigger part, and it's possible it originally was and then it got cut out. When Bomer does have a shared scene with Pettyfer, it's beautifully sinister. Those blue eyes and scratchy voice taunt Pettyfer's character in a way that makes him seem like a devil in disguise. It's a small role, but the scene is unforgettable. Cody Horn plays Pettyfer's sister, and is basically the only female part in it other than Tatum's fling (Olivia Munn), and portrays concern over the slow dive Pettyfer goes into after the lure of the night scene catches up to him. She keeps it cool and delivers enough emotion when the time is right. I only genuinely laughed once, when McConaghey is teaching Pettyfer to strip. It was a chuckle, but the rest of it from there on out turned out to be a depressing turn of events for Alex Pettyfer. It's not really a fun movie, if you're like my friends and went because that's what you expected, but it's not shameful enough to be labeled as a melodrama. The fact of the matter is, the stripping world is not all fun and games, someone's gonna end up hurt. I'm glad the promotion for this movie's over and done with now though because Channing Tatum's image as ""Hottie of the Summer"" is really starting to get on my nerves. It's a tad mean to say, but this movie would've been a lot better without Channing as the lead. I had a hard time watching the movie because I found the dialogue insufferable at times. Constant F-bombs hurled every which way, and I realize it makes me sound a bit like a prick but it gets annoying after a while, and Channing Tatum seemed like he couldn't handle the words. In a scene shared by McConaughey and Tatum, they share the same type of mood and while I'm assuming Tatum's gonna make a greater dramatic performance here it's a let-down, and McConaughey ends up stealing the show. Turns out Mike isn't all that Magic.",Magic Mike
202,lisa-ta93,Sexy!,5,27 July 2012,"First of all, I would only recommend this film for women with an interest in abs and stripper men. I wouldn't recommend this film for mother and daughter as it'll be purely awkward. Awkward because there is a scene which is a little out of focus but still visible, a man trying to enlarge his penis with a penis enlargement cylinder. Also, there were 2 other nude scenes and sexual references. First of all, the choreography and done extremely well and was enjoyable to watch. You get what you expect, a group of great looking men. It was unfortunate that the length of these stripper scenes probably lasted for a total of half an hour or so. As for the plot itself, it could have been better. Some parts were pretty boring with little depth and amusement which I found pretty poor for a film I was so hyped up about. In fact the first half an hour of the film wasn't too excited. I rated this 8/10 for the stripper men and choreography as they were darn sexy. Acting was pretty good. But again, the plot wasn't amazing.",Magic Mike

205,stephrenee-385-451528,They've Got the Magic Flick,9,29 June 2012,"Girrrllll I seriously considered that being my entire review, because that accurately sums up my reaction to this beautiful example of cinematic genius. There may be a legal battle brewing between Channing Tatum and his former stripper buddies over the idea, but I do not care whose idea it was. All that matters is that this idea was executed. A strip club experience without the cover charge, expensive drinks, or some stranger's genitals being anywhere near your face? Yes, please! Believe it or not, the film has a plot and I feel obligated to share it. Mike (Tatum) is a jack of all trades and is trying to start his own small business. I guess he is too old to be paying his college tuition. Anyway, his credit is bad, but his body is hot, so naturally he strips with the Xquisite Male Dance Revue to rake in extra cash. While doing a roofing job, Mike meets Adam (Alex Pettyfer, whose characters are always easy to hate), a guy who can't seem to do anything right and later takes him out on the town. To return the favor, Adam helps to convince some sorority girls to attend that night's show at Xquisite and agrees to help out backstage. Of course, a situation arises that forces Adam to go onstage and though he cannot strip or dance at all, his performance is a huge hit and he joins the Revue.Everyone has different goals and dreams in this film. Adam wants to live it up as much as possible, which upsets his sister Brooke (Cody Horn). Mike wants to leave the stage behind one day and settle down with a woman he can talk to, which definitely is not his promiscuous bed buddy Joanna (Olivia Munn). The club owner Dallas (Matthew McConaughey) wants to make it to the big time in Miami and say ""All right, all right, all right"" as frequently as possible. And the audience wants to see attractive men shake it like a salt shaker. I will not say how the characters fared, but the audience definitely gets their wish.If you forgot that Channing Tatum got his start in the dance film Step Up, then MM (or should I say, mmm-mmm-mmm) will be a delightful reminder. He is way more agile and acrobatic than you would expect such a muscular man to be, and his dancing is sure to be as memorable as Christina Aguilera's singing was in Burlesque. The other strippers are very talented and entertaining, but are also great comic relief. This goes especially for ""True Blood"" star Joe Manganiello with his risqué stripper alias and McConaughey. Some may say that Dallas is just another example of McConaughey portraying himself in a movie, but I don't see the big problem with that. Here he is more tanned, more toned, more vain, and seemingly more stoned than his public persona, and I think that all of those traits were perfect for the drawling egomaniac of a character that is Dallas.You may not believe me, but the strippers' bodies are not the only visually appealing aspects of this movie. Between Steven Soderbergh's artful direction and the unbelievable dance moves, several scenes play like an extended, gritty music video. I appreciated how a character's self-destruction appeared in slow motion with a backdrop of darkened neon colors, and that their self-destructive behavior was even addressed. Soderbergh and the rest of the crew could have easily made this movie an endless display of flesh, but they recognized that most of the cast can truly act. Magic Mike briefly touches on the fact that strippers not only provide an illusion for their customers, but are often living in one all of the time. And then it gets right back to the skimpy costumes and gyrating. Oh, what fun! Magic Mike is definitely not award-worthy, but it is the best kind of sensory overload from start to finish. Go with a bunch of friends, feel free to applaud throughout the film, and resist the urge to tip the ticket taker on your way out.Article courtesy of The Rogers Revue",Magic Mike

As far as the stripping goes and the first hour of the movie, it wasn't that bad. I actually had a good time. When the movie got close to two hours, I along with everyone else in the theater were ready to leave. That being said, I think the writer of the film was also ready to leave... his computer from writing the script, because there was NO ENDING... they kind of sum up two characters and thats it.. for the rest of the cast you spend 2 hours getting to know them, you have no idea if they die from too much crack or if they quit dancing or if they have fun at a new club... there needed to be at least a photo of each character with a small description of what happened to them next...

As it appeared I was wrong. First of all: although Channing Tatum here actually played his part instead of just being on the screen, I've had too much of his ego after first 40 minutes. Second: none of the cast, except for Matt McConaughey and Matt Bomer, was visible enough to create a full-blooded character. I will not mention their bad preparation, because I can't believe that you cannot teach Joe Manganiello how to dance. And third: it is really sad not to see the director's work. It seems like no one red the script to notice how bad it was, when it comes to structure and building characters. I got an impression that for some, money and wild party were the only reason to take part in this project. As far as I'm concerned, I'd like to see more of ""Let's make a good film"" attitude rather than purely ""Let's make loads of money from girls shy enough not to go into strip club""...

210,lynne-grummitt,A Potential Not Quite Reached,2,5 August 2012,"(May Contain Spoilers)While this movie had the potential of becoming every woman's (and gay man's) favourite movie of all time, it failed dismally. Instead of being something to bring out and watch on 'girl's night', it has become something to laugh about when friends look back and remember that one time they wasted 2 hours of their life. The dancing and stripping where the only highlight of the whole movie. The story line was poorly thought out and it never reached the heights it could have gone to. The base line was there, it just never elevated. The acting was terrible...absolutely shocking! Never again will I silently reprimand the makers of Twilight for casting Kristen Stewart. She is miles better than anything I saw in this film. Which is very surprising considering that Matthew and Channing are somewhat talented stars. So here I would have to blame the Director - Steven Soderbergh. The set, lighting and sound were very poor as well. I can only hope that it was a failed attempt at making it seem more like a real life documentary than an American Box Office hit. Otherwise there would be no excuse! A huge disappointment all round. I was not expecting high graphic 3D male parts to jump out at me of course, but it could have been a lot better. The film was clearly very low budget and what I fear may have been a rushed project. It was like they thought ""Hey, who gives a crap if this movie is any good...women and gay men all over the world will see it just for Channing and Matthew.

She's very similar to Kristen Stewart. Little emotion, awkwardness, similar voice, and overall uncomfortable. I hope this kind of acting isn't becoming a thing.

In fact, at once point we commented that we wished we had sat at the back (instead of right in the middle) as we'd have been able to sneak out! I cant argue that Matthew McConaughey has an amazing body, but seriously, it was like watching a relative at a wedding making a fool of themselves, it actually made me cringe! Channing Tatum and Alex Pettyfer are beyond gorgeous, but even they couldn't help turn this movie round! A real shame, and i'd recommend not only waiting until its released on DVD, but wait until its on at Christmas in 3 years time!",Magic Mike
214,Rachel-Anna,Loved it!,8,1 August 2012,"Just saw this movie and to be honest I didn't have high expectations about the movie itself. I was just looking forward to seeing gorgeous shirtless guys dancing around on stage and thats about all. As it turns out, I really enjoyed the whole thing, story included. It touched on a few serious things, had some great one liners, the chemistry between the guys was great - they made it believable that they were mates who performed together, and the guys were babes! (Just as a side note, some of the guys weren't that great at dancing but still did a great job!) Also, the movie flowed well, it wasn't all stop-start like some movies are these days. Definitely recommend this movie, even if you go with your girlfriends for a bit of fun!",Magic Mike
215,teninchhero,There's more,8,8 January 2018,"We get introduced to a unknown world of male stripping, the business, the marketing & what's going on backstage. I got into this film with my girlfriend, thinking it was just hot guys rubbing faces with their groins. But very soon i started noticing depth. This movie isn't about the stripping; it's about the life of the strippers. it's about how a seemingly troubled young man gets involved in the business, and how to cope his new found life. It's about a guy who's already been in the business long enough to want to get out and how to cope with other realities. It's about love, friendship, drugs, anger, joy, fear. I think the movie catches some of the moments and emotions and makes them real. I don't believe in happy endings, i believe in realism, and on some levels this movie delivers just that.I'm rating this 8/10 for reasons above mentioned. Though I didn't like some parts om Channings acting nor the coldness of Alex Pettyfer, who would like a friend like that?",Magic Mike
216,garofolon,"If you come into this film with expectations, you're bound to be disappointed",8,7 May 2013,"The title says it all. Reading the other reviews for this film, I see most people's issues were from expecting this movie to be all laughs or all male strippers but when the result was a complex mixture of emotions, all of which played expertly subtle by Soderbergh, they leave feeling disgusted. Still, I don't think this movie is for everyone. And that's not because of the male stripping, although that in itself will scare away straight men for obvious reasons. There's humor, romance, and drama that makes this film rich and complex. Unfortunately, it makes the smart decision to underplay these themes in favor of a more realistic and relatable storyline. Thats where it loses most of its mainstream audience. Some people need their movies to have a moral to the story if its a cautionary tale or exaggerate sexual tension if its a romance to the point of pretty much beating you over the head with it. Without this, they tend to get bored and confused. Because this movie decided to do neither of these things, not in spite of it, in my opinion that makes this movie stand head and shoulders above most of the rest of what Hollywood is putting out there these days. That and the excellent performances by Tatum, Pettyfer, and Horn push what would've been a 3 star review into a 4 star one. So, if you prefer movies that are more about the getting there than the destination this may just be surprisingly good. For everyone else, I say skip it. But if you do fall into the latter group I simply ask that if you choose to watch and review this film you try to take into account your own biases before writing so that those who might have a better shot of enjoying this film aren't deterred by a scathing review that may not be quite so warranted.",Magic Mike
217,filmartst19,"No Magic, Just Mike",1,7 June 2015,"Honestly, This film received a lot of hype when it came out and the hype should be over. It is insanely overrated. Yes, there are some famous people in the film, but that shouldn't make you love it, the storyline and entertainment should and this film was lacking in both areas. There was no storyline after Channing Tatutm's character meets Alex Pettyfer's character, just a bunch of random stuff happens and then there is no true ending, not even a cliff hanger which would make one say WTF. Channing Tatum's back up dancers were so horrible, they should have gotten professional dancers, rather than hire actors who only have a few lines anyways. Sadly they are bringing the same guys back for the sequel. The Best Part of Magic Mike is Channing Tatum because he can really dance and he can really strip, he was sexy, the other guys were just there, some were cute, but that doesn't make up for bad dancing when your supposed to be playing a stripper! Plus, the female nudity was random, the film just had a lot of randomness, like someone wrote many different scene ideas and compiled them for this film. And shame on whoever was the choreographer because clearly that person should have been aware of the lack of dancing skills of the other actors because Channing was so good, it made the rest of those bad dancers stand out, so also shame on the director for not trying to make the film better. Every little detail counts and I think great dancing for a stripping film is a big detail, that is the reason why people went to go see it. I only like two scenes and those are the ones where Channing is dancing other than that there is no reason to watch the movie. I unfortunately, got the film as a gift back when it came out, as I did see it in theaters, I tried watching the whole film, but the storyline really sucks, so, I would only fast forward to Channing's best dance scenes and once I realized I could see them on YouTube, there was no need to put the film in at all.Overall, not a good film.",Magic Mike
218,theWBohlken,Very good and touchy,7,29 June 2012,"There are few movies that actually make me sit there and worry about the characters and how they will end up at the end of the movie. Magic Mike is one of the few. I went in thinking all i was going to get was just a bunch of hot SEXY men dancing around and a little of a love story, but what i got was more that that. It was a story of a stripper who does two jobs during the day and strips at night on weekends just to get by and be able to start his own business. The trailers show that everything is OK and he is wealthy, but he wants this girl... NO! He is wealthy- ish but he can't get a loan to start his business and there is more to him liking the girl who happens to be the sister of a guy he is taking under his wing at the strip club. The movie has some great dancing scenes that make you want to moan for more and throw dollars at the screen, but after the glitz and glamour, you follow all these guys and how it all goes to their head. The movie doesn't glamorize or put down strippers but just shows how some take it to far.",Magic Mike
219,frankvignyc-974-261629,Magic Mike entertains but misses the big picture,6,19 April 2014,"Magic Mike does a fine job of entertaining following a young man into the world of stripping, just treading on the realistic filth the industry must garner - A simpleminded portrayal of a seedy world while pulling the strings of soft porn on its audience. The film follows a young Adam, (Adam Pettyfer) and his rise into stripping by way of his accidental meeting with the seasoned Magic Mike, (Channing Tatum) who appears to be the hot shot of the circuit. Magic Mike brings him into the fold in the midst of having bigger plans with the leader of the production Dallas, (Mathew McConaughey) who intends to move to a bigger city with the cast of beefy strippers. The film at its best is the few and far between backstage moments of wit and comedy as the macho men gear up like diva's readying for their performance. The well-choreographed staged numbers are top notch and I'm sure more so thrilling to the female audience. Tatum can dance, having been a stripper himself, and Mathew McConaughey brings his usual swagger in his stage gyrations. A few of the ensemble numbers are very well lit and convincing. But the story moves along the rails of the young 19 year old Adam who is naive, lost, and vulnerable, desperate for any opportunity. Having initially met Magic Mike at a construction site, Adam runs into him at a local club and becomes part of his ruse to entice women to the strip show. A fallen member of the dance core leads to Adam's opportunity to dance and soon with his shy performance that endears the female crowd he is on the team. Enter the concerned sister of Adam, Brooke (Cody Horn), who comes to the strip show to check on her brother, and moments later without any real chemistry, we have a overly sensitive Mike falling in love. Adam begins his decent into drugs while Mike plays big brother as a promise made to his sister. In credit to Soderbergh he is able to tell the story with a few lean moments even if it does not penetrate into any real concern. A bit flighty if you will, like, well, oh, yeah, drugs, girls, crazy, - Adam's in trouble, okay, got it. And the 110 minutes seemed a lot longer and should have been trimmed to fewer than 90 perhaps. As for the love story, it does little more than let you know that Mike and Brook have a thing. And with this new attraction comes the grand realization for Mike that perhaps he needs to reexamine his career. We have all the elements for a great film but Soderbergh seems content on paddle along the surface without any deep strokes, relying on the strip tease vehicle, sexy numbers, and casual salute to troubles, in this well told, competently shot, and fair acted film. The film has plenty of charm in the likable Channing Tatum and fun wielding Mathew McConaughey. It would be hard for anyone not to be entertained, unfortunately it is just has hard to walk away with any other lasting morsels other than a few laughs. I do recommend it as a likable film for casual viewing.",Magic Mike
220,Gobsmacker,I can't believe I watched the whole thing...,2,8 November 2012,"I rented this dreck based on the positive reviews it received. The story line is so predictable and the acting is so amateurish, I wish I shut it off after 30 minutes. There is no chemistry between Magic Mike and the chick. There's LOADS of chemistry between Mike and the brother however--the plot should have just evolved around the gay relationship between Mike and the 19-year old bro (who looked 25). There's one laughable ""serious"" scene where Tatum Channing (or is it Channing Tatum?) mush-mouths his lines! The dancing was fairly entertaining--but not enough to recommend the film. As for the other characters, they were all forgettable with the exception of Matthew McC, who was downright CREEPY. He's waaaay to old to be doing these pretty boy ""check out my abs"" roles!!!! Bottom line: AVOID!",Magic Mike

I have learned to judge for myself and I will say that I enjoyed this movie very much. I believe it gave a pretty good insight into the life and business of being a stripper. I have met some real life strippers and many of them has stated on occasion some of the problems as well as the behind the scenes stuff that can happen and that is the one think I did like was that the movie wasn't only focused on the positive but the negative sides to the business as well. It also shows how a person can change throughout their life in the job they do.",Magic Mike
222,DreamRedeemer,"Starts Great, Then Steadily Goes Downhill!",6,30 June 2012,"I went to see this movie with a major fan of Channing Tatum's, who was very excited about it and hoped that it would be a fun, exciting, and sexy film and thought it looked promising based on the trailer. For a movie with so much promise, it became disappointing about half- way through with a pooper ending so bad, that you leave the theatres feeling totally let down.PROS: - Channing Tatum as a male stripper :) - True Blood's main werewolf as a stripper :) - Matthew McConaughey as a stripper :) - Great Performances (costumes & music etc.) - Story is paced well with a unique'ish feel to it - Beginning is fun, exciting & HOT!CONS: - Half way through, it starts getting worse & worse - The storyline embraces an exhausted theme - The lead, Channing, pays for another's mistake* - Ends abruptly in a universally-disappointing wayIt is my belief that if either of us knew how the whole movie was going to be like, we might have waited for the 'cheap' night at the theatres or possibly until it came out on video. Truly, for a movie that looked so good and started so wonderfully, neither one of us who went knew what the writers, producer(s), or director were thinking with how they decided to end it.

I also feel as if Matthew McConaghey was mis-cast, and that James Gandolfini should have taken his spot. Other than those two things, not the worst film I've ever seen. The only way it could have been worse, was if Mike was actually a magician, but an absolutely terrible magician. A magician who can do nothing right, instead he is a stripper who can do no wrong. I also feel it was a little inaccurate, I say this only because all the male strippers that I have met in my life have been gay. When I say gay, I mean gay. Without a shadow of a doubt gay. Thats how gay they are.",Magic Mike

You joke and then forget them. Then there are very bad movies. They make us sit down the next day and write a 'review'. -- I constantly checked my watch during this endless, self-bemoaning, dreadful entertainment attempt. I stopped my count of the F-Word shortly after it reached 110+, not counting other male outbursts (4-letter words, references to anatomy) of what they tried to sell you as passion, emotion, desperation, intensity or whatever this was. Were we supposed to pity this group of desperate, sleazy, drug using-selling, hustling, strip dancing male con men that made appearances in this lifeless, annoying drivel? Perhaps it was to educate us to 'just say No!'? Sarcasm. The strip club owner remarked that kissing girl customers could lead to herpes. Never mind that everybody was doing it with everyone within reach. Indiscriminately. Women were just props, necessary backdrop. How else can you make male stripping work? Brooke, Adam's sister, was the only likable character in this whole dreadful boring thing, minus character development. As to acting, she had exactly 3 different facial expressions. 90% expressionless, detached (though pretty) face, the rest was divided into outbursts of anger and sadness. Mike was anything but 'magic'. A terrible script didn't help. He should consider going back to modeling, where he won't have to pretend to be a character.",Magic Mike
225,marathonmakers7-793-619051,Not your traditional bad movie...,4,26 October 2012,"I knew Magic Mike was going to be a bad movie, I just had no idea it was going to be so awful in such a weird way. Clearly, this movie was made for the naked men (which did not disappoint at all), but that shouldn't allow for such unbelievably amateurish and awkward writing, directing and editing. I mean, come on Stephen! I figured we'd have one of those painful Hollywood movies that are just packed with exposition and rapid-fire editing to keep American audiences awake. I was at first intrigued by Channing Tatum's butt, although the initial thrill wore off when people started speaking. Was this movie scripted? It certainly should have been, because none of the actors were particularly good at improv. The scenes of dialogue were extremely boring, made even more so by the director's insistence to favor long, drawn out shots. This is not a Kubrick movie, people, I'm not sure why you're being all high and mighty with your cinematography. What's happening on screen is not interesting enough to be carried by 2-3 minute long shots of people having inane, pointless, and apparently unplanned conversations. It reminds me of the times I get drunk with friends and turn on a video camera to make some stupid little really terrible improv video. It was like that, except Soderburgh has really nice camera and sound equipment. I appreciate that they were going for some kind of realism, but it came off as sloppy and not well thought-out.

Here's why:There is NO storyline The dialogs are so bad, it makes you think the author dropped out of school in 5th grade The acting is bottom shelf. The whole cast seems bored. There is zero chemistry between the protagonists. It says it all if I tell you that Matthew McConaughey, generally not known for exquisite acting, was among the better ones in this movie. The movie is not even funny, which would have made up for most of the other shortcomings. The sex appeal... oh well. Girls, if you're desperate, better rent a porno. If you just want to see Channing Tatum topless to half naked, go watch any of his other movies.To summarize, this film was one big disappointment. Don't watch.

A few points:The stripping themes dispense some sparkle even for male watchers, but are stretched way too far, repeated too often. - The characters not once touch the viewer. - There are way too many loose ends in the story that were probably meant to illustrate the lifestyle, but remain shallow and meaningless. - The movie shows some intentions to break with stereotypes, but after all simply undermines them. - The ending would be absolutely irrelevant if it would not mark the end of the movie, respectively if it would not end an overall weak plot adequately.",Magic Mike

231,bstrembicke,"A well done, raunchy and fun film. No Spoilers.",5,11 September 2012,"This movie actually really surprised me. I think we all expected it to bomb, (I know I did), and that's part of the films charm. I went in with incredibly low expectations, and was pleasantly surprised. Now let me say this: Magic Mike did not wow me. What wowed me was the quality that came out of it. Which isn't to say I didn't have problems with it; I had big problems with it. Firstly, I was not impressed with Steven Soderbergh's direction. I found the scenes that take place inside vehicles oddly lit, and cramped visually. I found majority of the party scenes physically hard to watch, massively confusing, and somehow always found myself worrying about any epileptics in the audience. That said, Soderbergh has his moments; the one that particularly jumps out at me is the tender moment between Mike and Brooke (his Kristen Stewart-wannabe-love-interest) on the terrace, which is lit romantically and shot with a modicum of talent. I also found the plot to be predictable on a ranging scale. I guessed a lot of things. I didn't guess others. Honestly, my biggest problem with the film, was its hypocrisy. Despite being a film about male strippers, it depicts far more female nudity than male, which is an incredible testament to how sexually biased Hollywood is. I really cannot explain beyond that why I was so infuriated by it, and honestly, it helped contribute to my overall mixed feelings about the movie as a whole. On a positive note, the film was hilarious. Drop dead, laugh out loud hilarious. I also really enjoyed the cast. The performances range from passable to great, with the majority being decent to well done. The most surprising aspects of the cast by far though, are Tatum and McConaughey. I'm not at all a fan of Tatum, I've yet to see him give a truly impressive performance, but this is the closest he's come so far. Part of me wonders if that was because of his personal experiences as a stripper, which adds realism and to his character, and I would wager ""yes"" is the answer, but either way, I left the theatre very impressed with the GI Joe star. And McConaughey is the star of one of my least favourite films of all time (2006's ""Failure to Launch"", which co-stars the equally abysmal Sarah Jessica Parker), but also starred in one of my all-time favourites (1997's ""Contact""), so I've been torn on him before. I wasn't torn here. He gave a really good performance, a really fun performance; which is really how I'd define this movie. Pure, sexy, wild, unadulterated fun. Overall, the film is enjoyable. I had a good time watching it, and was genuinely surprised by the quality of the product. It deserved the good reviews it got, and while it is in no way, shape, or form among the best films of 2012, it was a good film. Well worth six stars out of ten, maybe even seven, but I feel the need to judge it with an air of harshness because its flaws were so predominant. It was still a good film.

We have boobs and were not impressed so all of us let out a groan. There were saggy boobs later in the film, which according to the film were 'great'. Groan again. The dancing by the wrestler/dancer was awful either due to laziness or incompetence. The story was shallow which made it drag. The dance sequences were short and they had way too many clothes on to be strippers, one dance the main character had on pants and a shirt; the dancing was lacking and uninspired. The butts were cute but rare. All the main character did was say how he wanted to build things. He never lifted a hammer the whole movie. If anyone tells you this a like Boogie Nights-they are lying.

He seems like an arrogant prick that no one wants to be around. Go back to Dazed and Confused. Tatums poor acting will be overlooked because he is blessed with attractiveness.

I was actually kind of side-eying HBO for giving this 3 stars. It's a good movie but Tatum is not hot like he used to be but all the other guys even Matthew, are something to look at. It's a casual movie and it's all over the place besides nude men stripping for dollar billsIt catches you in the beginning but I had to watch this twice cause first time after most of the dancing is over it gets boring and I fell asleep. It never seems like anyone is actually 'acting' in this movie. You can tell there's a lot of Ab-lib in this from all the stuttering Tatum does later in the movie and he's not a great actor. To make him the lead is kind of blah. They should've use someone who's around 30 and looks beyond hot cause he isn't anymore.It's disappointing with this script but entertaining.

We didn't make it beyond the sandbar party scene. The male stripper culture was a little interesting, but beyond that, all the main characters were flat. Mike wasn't shown working on or designing the furniture he allegedly loved creating, and there was no tension between his workday/stripper life and his dreams. His on/off girlfriend, Joanna, is just there or not there; we don't care. His new love interest, Brooke, is just there, with no discernible personality. I love the very talented comedian Gabriel Iglesias, but his DJ character, Tobias, had almost no screen time.No spoiler here because we were so bored we turned it off. Unless you just want to see some hot guys nearly naked, dancing and faking sex, there is no reason to see this movie.",Magic Mike

This movie goes down as one of the WORST movies I've seen in my 40 years on this earth. The main girl (who I had never previously heard of) was not only a terrible actress, but she was uncomfortable to watch.Speaking of uncomfortable, the dialogue was extremely uncomfortable and awkward. It was as if there was almost no script and the actors were just giving a direction to go and hit certain points and from there they had to ad lib - which they did poorly.There was not even enough ""skin"" to make this movie worth it. In my opinion, women who were ""wooed"" by this movie must not be getting much action in real life. My advice: get out and get a real man or at least go see a real strip show. I wish someone would've warned me about this before wasting my money AND my time (that was the longest 2 hours of my life). I'm pretty confident my girlfriend and I (who hated this movie as well) aren't the only ones who felt this way. When we were walking out of the theatre, I didn't see anyone who looked liked they had a good time watching that movie.If you want to see the stage scenes, hit up Youtube.",Magic Mike

247,NuclearBassline,A Disappointment (Spoilers),5,14 January 2013,"I watched this movie expecting a lot more than what was delivered. This movie had a great cast of actors, all experienced, but the movie did nothing with them. Unfortunately, the only good parts of this movie were the stripping and dancing scenes (which were quite well done).There were 2 main plots that the movie attempted to develop, but halfway through, it was as if the screenwriter and director just gave up on them. This movie would have worked if the screenwriter had focused on one main plot and developed it instead of trying to cram them both into a 2 hour time frame. The movie could have focused on Magic Mike and how he is trying to get out of the stripping industry (maybe show us how he is trying to start his furniture business, show us why he is having trouble, at least show us scenes of him actually building/designing furniture). Or it could have developed Alex's plot line more thoroughly (show us how he loses his scholarship, show us the consequences of his drug use/selling, maybe show us what would have happened if Magic Mike hadn't bailed him out). The endings for both plots were quite weak, particularly Alex's. Alex seems to be heading down a path of self destruction through his drug use, but at the end, he magically becomes the new Magic Mike. Overall, the stripping and dancing scenes were fun to watch, which is why I gave this movie a 5, but if they had dropped one of the plots and focused on one major plot, I would have rated it much higher. Just because a movie is ""fun"" doesn't mean that it can't be intellectual too.",Magic Mike

Call it what it was.. which is a mildly funny movie with gratuitous nudity on behalf of the male cast. Granted the acting wasn't top notch, we aren't talking about an Oscar winning cast. Having said that, I did love Olivia Munn and Matthew McC. Tatum did NOT disappoint on moves and you will spend 75% of the movie fanning yourself. They played their parts well and it was very true to form of strip clubs in Tampa. If you are going to go watch this with the idea that your going to see some deep insight into the emotional side of these men, don't. What you will see is a movie where Channing moves like silk, Magniello is carved from something holy and McC.. well I have a new affinity for assless chaps.",Magic Mike
250,stevemodeen,Didn't know what to expect - Very impressed!,8,29 October 2013,"I haven't wrote a review on here before although being a fairly active member for 2 years. Haven't really felt the need to contribute as I feel most of the films I like are fairly judged and I can't quarrel. With the reviews here I feel my 2 cents need to be added, as I feel many people who have submitted a review haven't got the intention of the film.Here we have a director who isn't known for shallow film making in any respect, taking on a subject that on the outside seems the epitome of shallow - male stripping. But Soderberg hasn't focused on the flesh aspect (for lack of a better term) and instead looks at the relationships between these guys who seem relatively isolated from the mainstream of society. Themes of loyalty, self discovery, doubt and discrimination are all explored here while being shot in a very laid back style, the dialogue being very funny and realistically unpretentious considering its subjects.While watching the ""action"" scenes (stripping) I was surprisingly entertained for a straight male, I enjoyed the way these men just went about it like the business it was and were very professional. The scenes in the back had great chemistry between the men. But this is where I think many reviews get it wrong - this isn't a 90 minute strip show. I think the inclusion of action scenes were adequate enough and the movie would have suffered if they added more in. The best parts for me were the casual yet loaded conversations with Cody Horns character and mike and her brother, very sweet and I think she is a star in the making, a very strong screen presence. Matthew Mahogany continues his streak of great performances, stealing the scene every time he turns up. Hope he continues to stay away from the zombiefied romcoms he used to do.So that's about all I have to say about that, I hope more people can appreciate this movie in time, it is not a masterpiece but it does make you think of the bonds we share and the assumptions we make about peoples professions. The cinematography is excellent too.8/10 for me.. PEACE",Magic Mike

It wasn't funny, it wasn't interesting - this movie simply has no plot, it was truly tedious to watch it. Very slow action that doesn't go absolutely anywhere. Moreover, the actors' play was just pathetic, like they were a bunch of losers that had no idea how to act (except for McConaughey but his presence didn't really add much to the quality). It was really painful to watch, I'm surprised I even lasted till the end. How sad that the highlight of this movie was the appearance of the teacup pig! Additionally, the ending was completely pointless. The score of 2 is only for the nice male bodies - very disappointing overall. S H A M E !!!",Magic Mike
252,bobbiheisley,Lovved it.,10,19 July 2012,I couldn't get enough of it... loved the dancing and cute butts. Matthew was excellent.. Channing is a wonderful talented dancer. I'm going to see it again with my mom and my other best friend. I need it to stay in the theater for one more month.. I might be able to see it four times depending on my schedule. Houston needs to have a girls club just like this. Every woman needs to escape to a club like this. The men were sexy and there was plenty of humor in this film. We need more movies like this for women. Because we can be law breakers. I would've liked to see a tiny bit more dancing from Matthew. They saved the best for last. Sexxxy Matt!!,Magic Mike

A way to get into a world that is really masculine most of the time, now from a feminine point of view. Empowering almost. You can understand the sexiness of the ""easy money"" and popularity. McConaughey's acting seemed great to me, pretty disturbing character, very well played. Channing Tatum is the king of the movie with a very complex and human role. And he dances.....yes he does!!!

I don't know exactly what I was hoping to see(ahem, a lot more of the stripping scenes, since that's the only reason I wanted to see this). It was way too long, those two hours felt like forever. A lot of the scenes just dragged on and they could've left a lot of scenes out, in my opinion they served no purpose in the movie whatsoever. I think they concentrated too much on Adam's sister; I didn't care about her character, I didn't care about the relationship between her and Mike either. The actress also had the same expression on her face the whole movie.Thank god the men in this movie were hot, otherwise I would certainly have walked out of the theater. The ending was shitty, instead of showing Mike and Brooke at her house, it should've ended with an amazing stripping scene.

There isn't meant to be a moral, an underlying lesson all it is, is Channing's early life before he became a hunk on the silver screen. Though I didn't really care about the plot because honestly the only reason I watched this movie was because I wanted to watch hot men not because of the storyline. I'm pretty sure that's exactly why a lot of other women went and seem it.

There is no story, terrible acting, the cinematography is so poor (taken with a yellow filter) it makes your eyes tired. Matthew McConnaughy is in the movie for maybe 10 min. total. There is no character development and the writing is so bad, you want to just turn it off. Musical score non existent and supposedly written by Matthew. There is no scenery to look at and most of the movie takes place indoors in cheap apartments, inside a truck and trashy strip joints. And NO, Maroon 5 music not in the movie. There are other recognizable actors in the movie and it makes you wonder after reading such a bad script, why they signed on. Had to be for the money, as this will only hurt their careers.

Over an hour passed and I somehow had it in myself to stay awake. I waited and waited for SOMETHING to develop but this movie just kept dragging on. I wasn't surprised that there was no ending, because there was no story to begin with! It was more ""little things going on here and there"" rather than an actual solid plot. The most enjoyable part was when the credits began to roll up.

There was a lot of hype leading to the release of Magic Mike though I couldn't help but feel disappointed when I finally viewed the film. Despite a cast of largely beautiful people, the acting doesn't leave much to comment about. A number of the characters often come across as aggressive or overtly negative while others are difficult to relate to as they're unrealistic.The plot is rather empty and many events are 'just because' without reasoning or a backing story.If you want to sit back and not think too hard then Magic Mike is for you.

As part of the special package they served cupcakes and champagne before the screening...but the real dessert was definitely Channing! I've seen a couple of his films before..wouldn't't have said I was a Channing fan or anything like that..but I like romantic comedies, and he seems to be the go to guy...but seeing him in this movie literally blew my panties off. This movie isn't just a stripper film...I can only describe Magic Mike as a TOTAL PARTY.. it's funny, shocking...and surprisingly heart felt..I really wanted Magic Mike to get the girl (as if there was ever any doubt)Yes, there's dancing, yes they're nearly naked..but I thought the relationship between Magic Mike and 'The Kid' was really great..all the guys are funny (and of course hot) but there's great chemistry between the whole group. For people who think this is just a film for the ladies and the gays, I think you're wrong...the two straight guys who were with our group really liked the film..and who cares if they (pretended?) to cover their eyes during the stripping scenes...they liked seeing guys party..it's definitely a male fantasy I think..to be up there and to make women scream for you to take your clothes off. I'd never seen Cody Horn in a film before..she's definitely got that 'next big star' quality. I could totally see Matthew Mcconoughay getting some sort of award nomination for his role as the strip club owner, 'Dallas'...but seriously..I've never seen Channing be this good...Brad Pitt should stay home with the kids, because he's definitely been replaced as the hottest man alive in my book..I'm going to start the campaign now for Channing to be People Magazine's sexiest man alive for 2012!",Magic Mike

For the ladies who have actually been to a male strip club, then you know the club scenes were dead on and we got to see Channing Tatum do what he does best, DANCE! There was also the added bonus of seeing Matthew McConaughey act like a stoner, hippie nut (or is he acting.) I'll admit, there is not much of a plot to speak of, which would have been fine if they had only kept with the comedic route but they attempted to turn it into a drama & frankly, none of the actors are strong enough for dramatic roles. It would have been better if the movie had remained simple, silly and solely for eye candy purposes.I saw it a free screening and half of the limited availability was wasted on people with absolutely no interest in seeing it, but got in line because it was free. That being said, if go into this movie expecting Oscar worthy entertainment, your are not very smart & you're going to be sorely disappointed. If you are a woman who plans to drag your reluctant male significant other to see it, don't. If you are a chic who goes ""ewww"" at the sight of a male body, but pours over your Victoria Secret catalog picking out your favorite angel, this ain't the movie for you.

This movie is about male strippers, nothing more, nothing less. Don't think you are going to get a thought provoking, surprising story line out of this one. You can pretty much guess what the entire movie is going to be about in the first 20 minutes. It is relatively funny. The bottom line is you go to see this movie for one reason and one reason only... to see some really fabulous men dancing their booties off half naked.

As we stood there waiting the crowds of women kept coming, by the time we knew it there were 5 lines and the sheriff was there trying to instill order. It was really something! The horrible part was waiting, no A/C being able to get to us...so we were a little irritated and sweaty. But it was so worth it. I think this movie was a get away for all women! Leave your men at home and get out with your girls...believe me! After watching this I felt like I had cheated on my boyfriend with several different men...lol! Channing Tatum has really improved his acting skills, before I felt like he just seemed timid in front of the camera but overall there has been a major improvement. O and the boy can dance!!

They had three plot lines going during the movie, all were not developed enough and it made the entire story scattered. Furthermore, they didn't give those story lines appropriate endings, so we just ended with breakfast and kissing and called it an effing day. What a waste. Channing Tatum was okay in his role, but there were times where he stumbled over his words and I was left wondering if that was an error and poorly edited, or if it was left in to make it seem more natural.The sound editing was weird to me, conversations from the upcoming scene began before the shot of the ending scene was over.",Magic Mike

I was not there to see the stripping, but there to see if this movie had any sort of a plot. Here's the main focus of the plot: Mike is an ordinary man by day and stripper by night. Although it may not seem like it, Mike has a dream of owning his own business with stripping as his only means of funding that dream. He then mentors a younger co-worker (Adam) in the life and style of stripping (good and bad). As the movie progresses, Mike becomes aware of Adam's sudden change of personality, behavior and the movie shows the darker sides of his night job. From then on, Mike wonders about whether he needs to leave this lifestyle or continue to do what he does best.Seems like a generic plot but it does have a nice flow to it. Tatum really brings out his character. There are some good laughs and definitely not as explicit as some would've thought. We don't know much of the supporting cast, outside of Adam, Brooke, Dallas and Tobias. Matt McConaughey's character is very good and yet very underutilized throughout the movie. That is one of the cons I have for the movie. I also think the casting for Brooke was very odd as Cody Horn doesn't seem comfortable in this role, nor is she any good for this role.Overall, it was a good movie.

Like a previous reviewer mentioned, you shouldn't go in to this movie expecting an Oscar contender. Because, trust me, it was far, far from that. Perhaps even a few Razzie nominations would be fitting. Not a single character was even remotely likable. They all were very obnoxious (especially McConaughey). The relationship between Mike and Brooke (Cody Horn) seemed very forced and unnatural. The characters were so unlikable that after 30 minutes into the film, I was ready for it to be over. I thought the script was very bland. The move was also too long. It didn't seem to have a plot line. The film just meandered for nearly two hours. It was almost torturous. The only thing that was OKAY about this film was the cinematography. It was shot in typical Soderbergh style. At the end of the film, I asked myself, ""Why should I care?"" It was a total bore.

Besides the dancing and hot bodies, the plot was boring and terrible. In my mind, it was like... is that it? Where is this going? And when the credits started rolling, I think I actually said ""WTF? That's it?!"" And why were there no hot girls?! I am very picky about females as being one myself, and the girls in this film were unattractive and had annoying characteristics. Cody Horn the girl who played Brooke was not attractive for the role. Terrible actress, couldn't even act like there was an attraction between her and Tatum. She is definitely grouped with the terrible actresses that can't even act like they are in love in a film. And why did Horn keep doing this weird clenching thing with her mouth??? I was definitely side tracked by her annoyance in the film. And Matthew Mc, I usually love him, but this role was not fitting and felt very forced. And what happens to Adam?

I eagerly waited for the next strip scene and while the choreography was good, it really wasn't enough to make up for the rest of the movie.

Waste of time. Boring! The actors obviously needed some money so signed on. Any negative comment you can think of would apply!Really, I can't say it enough. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS MOVIE. If you do, you will be just as disgusted with waisting your evening on it as the rest of us were. Don't see this movie. Don't see this movie. Don't see this movie.",Magic Mike
274,raedaimaelaesti,glad i won tickets.,3,25 July 2012,"Magic Mike was great during the first half - a lot of scenes with all the spunks stripping,after that I don't know how they called that storyline to be honest,it gets into drugs, life issues and just outright jumps around without flow, ending scenes without completing them as well as opening issues that get dropped throughout the movie and with no actual ending this movie is definitely not what it was hyped up to be. i personally wouldn't recommend seeing it in cinemas but wait till on DVD and go rent your local video shop. the only good part was the sexy hunks taking off their clothes if thats what your wanting then good luck to you, definitely glad i got the tickets free.",Magic Mike
275,andiallison1,Two thumbs down,2,10 July 2012,"Yeah Channing Tatum is hot, but the storyline of this movie sucked.. Mike ruined the other guys life by getting him into sleeping around, hard core drugs, etc and he is oh so thankful in the end to be where he is? Like no your life went down the drain why are you happy. Is that what happiness is these days? And I didn't like the girl they used for Brooke as the main girl. This movie was extremely unsatisfying to me. I think they just wanted to make a movie about strippers so everyone would come see it and then realized they had to come up with a plot so they just tried to throw together 3 separate crappy plots. Overall unsatisfying.",Magic Mike

The soundtrack is atrocious, the acting poor, the script highly predictable. The film relies on cheap, unimaginative devices such as homo-erotic jokes and mainstream, plastic sexuality in order to evoke laughter.A typical mainstream American blockbuster, with your routine Hollywood pretty faces, nothing innovative, no creative lines, a tedious petit bourgeois story line.

Having said that, I was still unprepared for just how bad it would be.My expectations were of course very low, basically limited to having some eye-candy to enjoy while there is some kind of storyline developing in the background. What I didn't anticipate was just how uncomfortable that storyline would be because of the awkward characters. They are not even awkward in an endearing way, they are more awkward in the way that you feel legitimately embarrassed. I have had a similar feeling while watching people bomb out on Idols or America's Got Talent.The naked hotties unfortunately did nothing to redeem this movie. It would have been easier and less time-consuming to google images of these guys with no shirts on.The acting was terrible, the editing was terrible, the storyline was terrible.It feels almost as if Steven Soderbergh gave up trying before he had even started. I felt the same when I watched Che Part 1 and 2. He is a lazy director and has cemented himself as one of the worst directors I have had to endure the work of.",Magic Mike
278,brett-dran,Neither too good nor too bad.,5,2 August 2012,"""Magic Mike"" has a comedy genre and by seeing this I neither enjoyed nor dishearten a lot. Some of its comedy scenes were good but most of them were below par. When the film movie trailer for MAGIC MIKE was revealed, it was noticeable as just a ""male hooker film, like many others. But ""Magic Mike"" has its own style and unique contents. For those who haven't been deceived by the film movie trailer yet, Magic Mike is a story of Mike, a persistent man who lifestyle in Florida. To obtain his objectives of beginning up a personalized furniture company, which look like Phil Warhol designs, he functions several projects, one of which is losing. Yes that's right Mike's main income is showing off his human system to a lot of women who are fulfilled to variety his slangy underwear with costs. However, one lady manages to go through the go of cougars, drunks, and dreamers and somehow manages to stimulate something further in him. As for the tale, well it's different from the common really like tale I believed I'd need to look at and actually is a tale of two strippers. One tale specializes in the go up and down of the character known as Adam and his leap into the planet of female's entertainment. The second and perhaps primary tales of course is on the fall and improve of Mike, aspect of such as the enchanting lady you've seen in the movie trailer. Unfortunately both experiences consist of the excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages, which the movie seems to market as the only way to have pleasant development. It's difficult for this author to keep in mind surroundings where Adam or Mike weren't put over or without a alcoholic beverages in their hands, which to me is just sad. Although they display the terrifying of treatment usage, Magic Mike also has some visible treatment use and humorousness that I didn't proper take proper. Although it is most likely used to highlight the low aspects of their lifestyle, showing several shots of treatment triggered mountains, sex, and attack is not my concept of pleasant. The actions in this film were downright amazing. Channing Tatum has lately just getting better and better with every film that he has been in. His character in this film is so considerably and interesting that you can't help but want to know more about him. I can mainly say that for all the celebrities as well because every character is so well developed and so considerably that you really get invested into this film. The stripping/dancing moments are the most exciting factors of the film and I linked with myself worn out with everything else. It tries to be more than a stripper film, but it isn't able at it. It's not fun, it's not excellent it's trapped in the center and it seems to be an automated a lot of a lot of your power and power. I think if the film had taken more possibilities and tried to be further, it could have been somewhere along the choices of Appear Night here we are at the stripper market. It's a great misuse of Soderberg's ability.",Magic Mike

I arrived at the cinema,sat down with popcorn and a smile on my face, but within the first hour of the movie, the popcorn was all gone and so was my smile.It was shocking, the movie had no plot or purpose, it was just about a good looking group of men stripping and taking drugs. How interesting. The thing that got me was the ending, 'you want to get something to eat?''Yeah, but the place i like opens in 7 hours''what can we do in 7 hours?' (kiss) THE END......What happened to Adam? Did Mike go on to pursue his dream of making unique furniture(or what ever the hell it was he was doing?) This could have been a great movie but the story was all wrong.For those who just want a girlie night in watching a bunch of hot guys dance around then this may be for you, but i like a good story line when i watch a movie. 3/10",Magic Mike

281,jenkinsri2003,Truly Dreadful,1,13 August 2012,I found nothing to like about this movie. It is billed firstly as a comedy and then as a drama. There was no comedy. I didn't laugh. The script was dreadful. There was no drama. Why did anyone think it would be a good idea to make this film? This is the worst film I have seen this year. My only purpose in writing this review is to warn you not to go and see this film.The acting was wooden. The story line weak. The soundtrack abysmal. The dialogue dire. I was bored. I kept hoping the movie would have at least one redeeming feature. It fails miserably on all counts. I want my money back.,Magic Mike
282,ZangoKid,"Sex Lies and Videotape, It Ain't!",4,21 August 2014,"I rented this movie because I saw MUD and Dallas Buyer's Club. (strange how that word Dallas has attached itself to Matthew McConaughey) I knew ahead of time that he would not be in the movie very much but I was curious to see it anyway. OMG! At the end of the movie when I saw that Steven Soderbergh directed it my jaw dropped. This would have been an OK movie for TV. I was mildly entertained at best. The dull colors, the lack of close ups or any kind of interesting camera work made me think it was some new director I never heard of. And the dance numbers! Please. So You Think You Can Dance has way better dancers even in the audition stage. These are pros? This felt more like The Full Monty without the charm. I didn't know who any of these actors were except McConaughey. I hope they all get a better script next time. And since I am new to reading IMDb reviews I will take the time to read them before renting another film. Thank you all!",Magic Mike

285,Quicksylvia,Hard bodies soft plot,3,18 January 2013,"Don't get me wrong; I drool over Matthew Mc C. He is gorgeous with a Capitol G. And therein probably lies my problem. He is not featured enough. It's almost like they have put him out to pasture and he is worthy of so much more than that. What a shock transition from lovable smart hunk to this creep in the movie. No holds barred you just would not be drawn to him. And to be quite honest for a movie that's aimed at women with all the Male testosterone going on I was terribly disappointed. I've been a Chippendale fan and could not agree more that male strippers are clean and legal. Nothing happens except to give frustrated women a thrill in their mind. But come on. Here we have a sex stud, Mike, only too familiar with threesomes from his all star fan base who worship him but he chooses to fall in love with the idiots (the drop out with zero charisma) grumpy sister who has a boyfriend already perhaps because she is not remotely interested. Excuse me lets knock over those gorgeous girls to get to Ms No Smile? For me I was embarrassed and disappointed. The strip scenes were fun but tacky and sure as hell not original.

Do not watch it alone you will be bored to death but if you watch it in a group you can laugh at the shocking acting and boring story lines. Its disappointing on so many levels, the acting, the storyline, the stripping, the uninteresting and irrelevant dialogue, the cast, the dance routines, not one thing is good.So moral of the story is don't watch this film.

287,maxbettridge,"Lots of topless men, in a pointless story",5,6 June 2013,"Last night, while surfing Netflix, I came across the film 'Magic Mike', and decided, maybe this was worth a watch.Magic Mike is the male stripper based movie, that you will have heard women chat about starring A-List Hollywood Hunk Channing Tatum, this film was aimed at predominately teenage girls, and I am sure they loved it.Why i decided to watch it? Curiosity. I definitely regret this decision. The main plot of the film was constantly being interrupted by music montages and topless scenes; which was embarrassing for all involved. It must be said I find it hard to believe that even the teenage girls can be happy with the film, as even the stripping scenes are only used to fill in plot holes. All in all, an average film that was only able to get any viewers because of the promise of half naked boys all greased up.Don't make a mistake of watching this film if you have any self respect.However teenage girls, go knock yourselves out.",Magic Mike

But once the stripping starts, it is watchable by the pure fact that all the men are HOT. Channing Tatum does lend a few comic relief moments, so all is not bad here. I did also enjoy all of Matthew McConaghey's throwbacks to his character in Dazed and Confused. Every time I heard ""alright alright alright"" I laughed pretty hard in spite of myself. Adam Rodruguez looked really good, and Gabriel Iglesias provided more comic relief. Don't see this for a storyline, obviously. You could probably watch it with the sound off. But, I do have to say, YUM.",Magic Mike

I can't tell you if it was a cinematic masterpiece, I genuinely can't see much without my glasses, but what I can say is by the sounds of it someone cried and the men were angry.

291,larksine,I Believe in Magic,6,24 April 2016,"If your first assumption is that Magic Mike is about strippers who are caught up in the life of sex, drugs, and alcohol, you're right. However, this movie surprisingly has more depth to it than that. The movie has something for everyone, from beautiful men dressed in less-to-nothing, to interesting characters with more-than-one layer, to a well-written story with well-placed twists and turns. From a psychologist's point of view, the likable and talented Magic Mike (Channing Tatum) is in a state of identity moratorium: radical exploration of all that life has to offer, which the movie mirrors. Throughout the movie, Steven Soderbergh uses cinematography, music, and an insightful script to give the audience an exploratory view of Magic Mike's desperate search for meaning in his life. Mike is an unashamed ""entrepreneur/stripper,"" going through a moral crisis. Channing Tatum, who plays Magic Mike, will captivate you with the facade of a confident man who knows what he wants by night. By day, however, a literal light is shed on a man who is stuck in a reality he does not belong in. While Mike is stripping the audience is treated to a world filled with vibrant colors, quick camera shots, and energetic acting. Off stage, however, a distinct yellow camera filter is used to represent Mike;'s drawn-out hangover. The movie's soundtrack is also dramatically different from scene to scene, using hip, modern music to highlight the stripper's irresponsible nightlife activities, and gloomier music in the daytime, which allows the audience to see how heavy Mike's situation really is. Mike does not want to be a stripper. He is not ashamed of what he does, but stripping is not his passion. Mike's dream is to run his own carpentry business, but his dream is always a little out of reach. When Mike comes across Adam (Alex Pettyfer), who is ignorant to his own moral crisis, and Adam's protective older sister (Cody Horn), it becomes clear to Mike that his life choices affect more than himself. As Mike's attitude changes, the movie becomes less energetic and more dramatic. We see increasingly longer takes, more serious dialogue we begin to see the consequences of Adam and Mike's carefree lifestyle. Channing Tatum, Alex Pettyfer, and Matthew McConaughey can all put on a show, but McConaughey's talent deserves way more than one dollar bills. While Channing Tatum's dance moves are a definite crowd pleaser, McConaughey portrayal of Dallas steals scenes with swagger alone. His ability to capture Dallas' charisma and borderline sociopathic behavior is unmatched among the cast. Cody Horn also does an excellent job at playing the calm to the storm that is Mike and Adam's sex, drugs, and rock n' roll lifestyle. Cody's subtle disapproving facial expressions are able to say what the audience is thinking--that Mike and Adam can't live like this for long. Overall, the actors each deliver the movie's well-written dialogue with the perfect balance of humor and emotion. Magic Mike's biggest surprise is its surprising depth. While most audience members expected the movie to be a gaudy sex-romp, which it is, it is also a character-driven piece that teaches a lesson about the dangers of an excessive lifestyle. Soderburgh and the cast have taken a movie that could've been a shallow film meant only for twenty-something girls that want to ogle Channing Tatum and turned it into a enjoyable film that explores the process of growing up. While it may not be the perfect film, it will leave audiences looking for both sugar and spice, as well as the meat and potatoes of a meaningful film, satisfied.",Magic Mike
292,callisto3-1,Not entertaining enough,4,4 July 2012,"As a female, yes, I went to see this movie thinking it would be raunchy and entertaining, though this is not my normal movie fare. It wasn't raunchy enough and it was only mildly entertaining. Honestly, I wished it was dirtier. A movie about male strippers and all we get are buttcheeks? If this movie can't be good, can it at least be a turn on? Apparently not. For once, can't we see some penis in a movie? I'm so tired of seeing breasts (of which you see a few times in this pic). The relationship between Mike and Brooke was so awkward. I didn't see sparks at all and how could she fall for someone who brought her brother into the stripper lifestyle and then let him get all effed up on drugs? She seemed so protective of her brother Adam, but all of a sudden Adam doesn't live with Brooke anymore and she's going to hook up with Mike - the very man who introduced Adam to his now-problematic lifestyle? The weirdo blue/red drugs scene just seemed so out of place in the movie. Acting (aside from Channing Tatum) was not good either. Cody Horn (Brooke) is awkward to watch and lifeless. Matthew McConaughey is smarmy as always (""alright alright alright"" - does he say that in every movie?!) and no one really stands out in this movie. This movie doesn't really seem to GO anywhere or DO anything, really. Just kinda meanders with no revelations, points or anything. I was completely unimpressed and only mildly interested in the dancing/stripping scenes (Tatum is excellent in that arena). Just watch the uncensored trailer and save your money - not worth seeing.",Magic Mike

294,rovace86,Ordinary people learning from each at best,9,10 January 2013,"Warning Spoilers! After seeing many of the recent Channing Tatum movies like The Eagle, J.I. Joe, and Dear John, I can say he has come along way since his Abercombie modeling days. This film to me is considered indie with the fact that its a low budget movie and not a lot of recognizable actors. the film gives the intension that the main plot is to deal with life and issues strip club's members face but no quite. It's really about growing up. It shows what happens when you take a chance in knowing someone at their best and worst and it makes Channing tatum change for the best. I understand the kid's issue was finish and no clue what would happen to him if he does stay with Dallas(Mathew M.). But Mike(channing) could only go so far teaching him wisdow and moral values the rest is up to him. As he said to his sister its easy for him because he is young. Channing Tatum had the character, the motivation, and determination for success. he only need one more life changing experience to see past all the BS from Dallas and the was the kid's sister.",Magic Mike

My girlfriends and I were counting the days til it came out.Then we watched the move. It was good. Not exceptional, but good. The trailer made it sound like the movie was going to be like a bachelorette party. It was not. The genre was drama that dealt with serious topics such as drugs, different expectations, dreams and life. That being said, however, they did not go deep enough to any topic to really hit it. On top of that, because I didn't anticipate the seriousness, I kept thinking 'when are they going to strip again?' And that meant the movie was long, dull and simply boring... except for 30 mins worth of sporadic 'entertainment' scenes. When you go in for the movie, just watch out.
