0,Leofwine_draca,Cold-hearted,5,13 March 2019,"MR. BROOKS is a cold-hearted serial killer film with Kevin Costner playing a happily married businessman by day and a serial killer by night. This makes him rather hard to root for, and unlike AMERICAN PSYCHO this film doesn't really have much of a satisfying plot, making it an average watch overall. Some parts of it are really well handled, with William Hurt's id character really nicely conceived, but the whole apprentice storyline with the uninteresting Dane Cook character is a misstep. Costner is once again excellent but the film itself fails to engage the senses like it really should. It's interesting, but hardly gripping.",Mr. Brooks
1,SnoopyStyle,surprisingly good to see a couple of leading men play the bad guys,7,2 July 2014,"Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner) is a highly respected businessman with a loving wife Emma (Marg Helgenberger) and daughter Jane (Danielle Panabaker). He is haunted by his alter ego Marshall (William Hurt) who compels him to kill as the Thumbprint Killer. It's been 2 years since the last murder and he's been in AA. In the latest killing, he is photographed by peeping Tom Mr. Smith (Dane Cook) who wants the rush of joining in on more killings. Det. Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore) is investigating but she is struggling with a messy divorce and violent escaped criminal Thorton Meeks who has vowed revenge.I really like the Costner-Hurt pairing in this. They are cast against type as the serial killer and there is real chemistry about the alter ego relationship. I think both men have the same compelling leading man gone bad vibe. I don't like Dane Cook normally but I like him for this role. He's a douche killer wannabe and I think he fits this personality very well. He's creepy. He's annoying. He's pathetic. He's perfect for the role. I could do without Demi Moore and her messy divorce. It's not a big problem but it's piling on a little too many story elements. There are just a few too many main characters and could use a bit of trimming.The biggest problem is director Bruce A. Evans and his lack of good noir visual style. This needs to be tighter, more tense, even darker, and a grand cinematic vision. It has the feel of a hard boiled thriller from the 90s. It just doesn't get to the same level as some of the great dark serial killer movies. Also I don't like the dream ending. It feels like a waste of time. If the film wants to bring Jane into this, it should be done for real.",Mr. Brooks
2,claudio_carvalho,A Citizen Above Suspicion,7,21 June 2008,"In Portland, the philanthropic businessman and family man Mr. Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner) has been just elected Man of the Year. Mr. Brooks manages his factory of packages; lives in a comfortable house with his gorgeous wife Emma (Marg Helgenberger) and has a rebel daughter Jane (Danielle Panabaker) in college. However, Mr. Brooks has a dark secret: he is a psychopath serial killer also known as The Fingerprint Killer with an alter-ego called Marshall (William Hurt) and addicted in killing. For two years, Mr. Brooks has attended the AA meetings and kept his addiction under control. However, Marshall returns and forces him to kill a couple of dancers that is making love in their house with open curtains. On the next day, Jane returns home without her BMW and a man named Mr. Smith (Dane Cook) visits Mr. Brooks in his factory with pictures of him in the crime scene; he is blackmailed and the man requests to participate in a murder. Meanwhile, the wealthy detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore) is having a troubled moment in her life: she has been investigating the murders of The Fingerprint Killer; is facing her former husband Jesse Vialo (Jason Lewis) in a complicated divorce process; and is chased by the violent criminal Thorton Meeks (Matt Schulze) that has escaped from prison and promised to kill her. When Tracy visits the crime scene, she suspects that Mr. Smith is an eye witness of the murder and presses him, and their fates entwine with the life of Mr. Brooks.""Mr. Brooks"" is an entertaining psychological thriller where Kevin Costner plays a man with double-life: an entrepreneur recognized by the society and family man and also a clever and Machiavellian serialkiller. William Hurt is great in the role of the alter-ego of Earl. Demi Moore is an abusive detective, but also with good hunches and pressed by her scum ex-husband. And Dane Cook performs an imbecile engineer that aims to fell the adrenaline of killing a person. The plot is developed in an adequate pace, and the flaws and exaggerations are acceptable in this sort of entertainment. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Instinto Secreto"" (""Secret Instinct"")",Mr. Brooks
3,classicsoncall,"""Well, well, well. What would life be without surprises?""",8,19 September 2018,"This was a well crafted suspense thriller that I only had a couple of minor problems with. I don't know what a real person would do in Mr. Brooks' shoes, but Kevin Costner is the epitome of cool as a serial killer who's alter-ego/subconscious gets more of a thrill killing people than Brooks does himself. Actually they're both one and the same so that's a moot point. I really liked the way William Hurt was filmed as the shadowy conscience of Earl Brooks, especially those times he's sitting in the back seat of Brooks' car. There were any number of scenes in which he looked like the devil, egging his other self on to complete the next murder.What didn't quite ring true for me was the idea that Earl's daughter Jane (Danielle Panabaker) was an up and coming serial killer herself. Then that proposition is made laughable in as much as killing people isn't a trait that can be passed down in one's genes; at least I don't think so. When I heard that it was a big huh? moment for me, even as the story took that concept and ran with it, provoking Earl to cover for his daughter by taking a hatchet to another victim in her former college town. Then there's detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore), hot on the trail of the 'Thumbprint Killer' who comes away with a minor head wound after getting thrown from one moving vehicle into another at a rather alarming rate of speed. Ever try running into a wall at full tilt? But she did prove to be a pretty good investigator with sharp instincts about Baffert/Mr. Smith (Dane Cook). How the fact that she successfully pursued Hangman Meeks (Matt Schulze) and girlfriend Sarah Leaves (Traci Dinwiddie) got her off the hook for the deaths of her husband and lawyer girlfriend was neatly handled by Mr. Smith's inability to control his bladder. So all in all, things wrapped up pretty nicely. Oh yeah, one last thing. That nightmare sequence with Jane stabbing her father in the neck had me going for a while, relating back to Marshall's (Hurt) insinuation that she might try to take over his box company that way. But I had to wonder, when does anyone maintain a dream in which they see themselves actually die? You'd wake up in a cold sweat well in advance.",Mr. Brooks
4,gavin6942,"Really Suspenseful, Dense and Exciting Thriller from Costner",9,13 November 2007,"By day, Mr. Brooks (Kevin Costner) is an owner of a box company and highly respected in his community. By night, he feels the urges of the man in his mind (William Hurt) to kill couples and pose them. All goes well (at least for him) until he is caught on film. How does this new young man (Dane Cook) plan on blackmailing him? Oh, and plenty of other twists get involved here, too.My first thought upon hearing about this film was that ""it's going to be three hours long"", based upon previous experiences with Kevin Costner. This, luckily, was not the case (although a film this good could be three hours and be enjoyable). My second thought, once the opening credits rolled was, ""crap, this has Dane Cook, it can't be good"" because Cook ranks just below Ashton Kutcher on my ""All Time Most Worthless Actors"" scale (guess how I enjoyed ""The Guardian""?). These fears were dissolved... even though I kept thinking Dane Cook was going to ruin the movie, he actually did alright and the only way he could have done better was by not appearing in it at all.Everything about this film is enjoyable. The plot is so intricate -- we also have a cop (Demi Moore) tied in and another serial killer on the loose, as well as Brooks' daughter who may or may not be a killer herself. You'd think it would be impossible to fit so many story lines together without making the plot thin, but you'd be wrong. It works, it really works. And for some odd reason, Moore looks good for the first time in her long and distinguished career (Meg Ryan Disease, maybe?).If you're watching this as a ""horror"" film you're putting this in the wrong category. It's more of a thriller. Yeah, we get some blood (a really cool scissors-in-the-neck scene) and the first ten minutes show a nude woman over and over and over again (which is fine, although I thought the way they shot it was not necessary). I think horror fans will enjoy it, but people who are generally against horror will appreciate this film, too -- it's a hard film to hate with how good it is. I may be going out on a limb here, but I think this should have been submitted for an Oscar, because it is worthy. (I call as my first witness ""Silence of the Lambs"".) It's hard to review a film when you can't really say anything bad about it. Good pace, good suspense, great acting (except from Dane Cook), good incidental music, good lighting, exquisite plot... what really can I say? It's hard to pinpoint one thing that was really good, more good than everything else... it was just all so spectacular.I will watch it again and try to be more precise, but for now let's just say this film gets my highest possible recommendation. I think the horror film of the year must go to ""Planet Terror"", but for best film of the year (in any category) ""Mr. Brooks"" is definitely in the running... certainly top five. I suggest you watch it, right now.",Mr. Brooks
5,lee_eisenberg,Don't try to fool a Portlander.,7,11 November 2007,"I didn't know anything about ""Mr. Brooks"" when I turned it on, and I got a surprise when I saw that the movie takes place here in Portland! Unfortunately, it was clear that large portions got filmed elsewhere; we Portlanders know when movies don't get our geography right (not that I would expect Hollywood to get it right). In fact, I had never even heard of the movie getting filmed here at all! WTF?! Was it just that the last movie that Kevin Costner filmed in Oregon was ""The Postman""? Oh well. I still found it a pretty interesting movie, with Costner as a man with a murderous side. Granted, it's not a masterpiece by any stretch, but OK. Also starring Demi Moore, Marg Helgenberger and William Hurt.",Mr. Brooks
6,jboothmillard,Mr. Brooks,5,10 June 2021,"I looked up this film after it was broadcast on TV, and I recognised the poster, and obviously the good names in the cast grabbed my interest, so I gave it a go. Basically, Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner, also producing) is a wealthy and respected businessman and has been named Portland's Man of the Year. But he hides a secret life as a serial murderer known as the ""Thumbprint Killer"" (leaving his victim's bloodied thumbprints on the lampshade in the room they are killed). For the last two years, he been attending AA meetings to control his ""addiction"". He is constantly being egged on by his alter ego called Marshall (William Hurt), and they often have conversations about his murderous compulsion. One night however, he gives into his urges, and kills a young couple having sex in their bedroom. As with his other victims, he leaves the bloody thumbprints, meticulously cleanses the crime scene, poses the bodies, and locks the doors before leaving. During this murder, Brooks also closed the curtains, which neighbours notice are usually always open. Brooks' daughter, Jane (Danielle Panabaker), has dropped out of college and arrives home early, she asks her father for a job at his company. The same day, a man calling himself ""Mister Smith"" (Dane Cook) turns up at Brooks' office. He lives in the apartment across from the murdered couple and has taken photos of Brooks at the crime scene. Smith blackmails Brooks to accompany him during a murder, Brooks reluctantly agrees to his demands. Brooks' wife, Emma (Marg Helgenberger), says that Jane left college because she is pregnant. Brooks warns Smith that killing can become addictive, and that they will plan a murder in advance, from choosing a victim to following them to find out more about them. Later, detectives visit the Brooks investigating a murder in Jane's former campus dorm. Brooks realises Jane has committed a murder and believes she is developing urges herself. After shunning the idea of letting her get caught to ""save her"", he instead flies to Palo Alto and, letting Marshall take over, commits a similar murder to provide Jane an alibi. Leading the investigation of the young couple's murder is Detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore). She interviews Smith and several other residents. Brooks learns that Atwood is going through a difficult divorce from her husband, Jesse Vialo (Jason Lewis). He decides that Vialo and his lawyer/lover, Sheila (Reiko Aylesworth), will be Smith's first ""victims"". At the scene of the Vialo murder, Smith wets his pants in panic, leaving his DNA to be discovered later. After leaving the scene, Smith pulls a gun on Brooks, which Brooks and Marshall anticipated might happen. Atwood meanwhile becomes obsessed with solving the crime, at one point she becomes a suspect herself, but she will not back down, and goes to extreme measures to catch the real killer. Following the latest murder, Brooks says he cannot stop killing and plans to commit suicide to spare his family shame. He takes Smith to a cemetery and wants Smith to shoot him and place his body in an open grave that will be filled the next day. Smith attempts to shoot Brooks, but Brooks had previously disabled Smith's gun in case he changed his mind about suicide. Brooks decides he wants to live to see his grandchild and instead kills Smith, hiding his body in the open grave. Brooks has destroyed the blackmail photos, Smith's urine is the DNA evidence found by police, so he will be assumed as the Thumbprint Killer, allowing Brooks to remain undetected and return to his normal life. Knowing he is in the clear, Brooks calls Detective Atwood, whom he has come to admire. He asks her why she became a police officer, and she says her father had wanted a son, so she wanted to prove herself. Brooks hangs up before the call is traced. Atwood realises the voice was the real Thumbprint Killer. That night, Brooks has a nightmare in which Jane murders him, suggesting he fears she will become like him. Also starring Ruben Santiago-Hudson as Detective Hawkins, Aisha Hinds as Nancy Hart, Lindsay Crouse as Captain Lister, and Matt Schulze as Thornton Meeks. Costner is both questionable and good casting as the rich man with an addiction to murder, Hurt is playful as the killer's other personality that only he can see, Moore is okay as the detective, and Cook is alright if a little annoying. It is one of those films that could have delivered much more than it did, it has ridiculous ideas and goes in a different direction than you would hope for, but you can suspend your disbelief enough to go with it, the kills are eye-catching anyway, perhaps silly but not a bad psychological thriller. Worth watching, at least once!",Mr. Brooks
7,ccthemovieman-1,Very Strange And Extremely Entertaining,9,27 October 2007,"Wow! This has to be one of the more unusual movies I've ever seen, one that is leaves you shaking your head in amazement. I am hesitant to say too much for fear of ruining this for anyone who hasn't seen it. There is so much one could write, pro and con, about the material in here. Suffice to say if you like modern-day film noir, or ""neo noir,"" as its often called.....then check this out.An hour after watching this, I was still muttering to myself, ""Man, I can't believe what I just saw. This was a wild two hours.""I think that's the best recommendation I can give: this is pure entertainment, two hours of a story that grabs you right from the start and never lets go; a very involving story. Kevin Costner and William Hurt are tremendous in here, and worth the price of the rental alone. The whole cast was good but the dialog between those two guys - one real and one imaginary - have to be heard to be believed.There are a few parts I would have changed, including the ending, and I didn't particularly care for most of the characters but overall this is so fascinating a story and so entertaining, it didn't matter what I thought of the characters.If you want something entertaining, a little thought-provoking, edgy-yet-moralistic, good acting and photography, this is a pretty good value for your rental money.",Mr. Brooks
8,rmax304823,Warning: Serial Killer Ahead.,5,15 January 2010,"Just when you thought the serial killer movie was dead, just as it became clear that there were more movies about serial killers than there were serial killers, just as it seemed no more life could be breathed back into a thoroughly moribund configuration of stilted imagery -- here comes Mr. Brooks! Mr. Brooks is a serial killer by constitution, so he believes. Kevin Costner gives the role all he's got and at times bursts out of that lackadaisical cocoon he's usually in. He is a high-end executive. He has a loving wife, Marge Helgenberger, and a sweet-looking daughter, Jane, who has just dropped out of college because she's pregnant.All very normal, except that Costner's murderous impulses can't be stifled and when he kills a couple next door, he's spotted and photographed in the act by another neighbor, Dane Cook, who wants to get in on the act and blackmails Costner into teaching him how to be an effective serial murderer. So Costner reluctantly takes him along when they off their next victims.The next victims happen to be a man and his lover, and the man happens to be the estranged husband of the detective assigned to Costner's case. That would be Demi Moore. She has problems of her own, what with this divorce threatening to put a dent into her sixty million dollars worth of assets, and the stereotypical tattooed brute whom she sent to jail and who is now tracking her with the intention of doing nasty things to her body before he finally kills her.I don't know why Demi Moore's story is included in the film. Well, maybe I can guess. Mr. Brooks is a cool character. Costner thoughtfully walks through the story, talking to an hallucinated alter ego played by William Hurt. Hurt is just there to give Costner a chance to think things over out loud without a Chandleresque narration. Moore brings action and drama to a plot that the more elementary minded might thing too ""slow"". Moore is as dynamic as all get out. The camera cuts away when Costner is about to pull the trigger but Moore's gun is always ablaze, when she's not being kidnapped and half-scalped by that escaped thug. She doesn't catch Costner but that's not what she's there for anyway. She's there to reassure us that this is just another action movie about the pursuit of a serial killer. Put Costner's anguish aside, and you still have Superdoll left.I'm not sure I understood the end. As I mentioned, Costner believes that there is a ""serial murderer"" trait passed from generation to generation and blames himself when his daughter leaves college just after a sloppy slaughter takes place there. Maybe she did it. After he kills his stupid blackmailer with a shovel and buries the body, he returns to his home, leans over to kiss his daughter good-night, and she thrusts a pair of scissors into his neck and he bleeds to death under her dispassionate stare. But, it was all a dream! That hoary dream ending is a disappointment because it leaves the story hanging. I suppose it was grafted on to the plot -- though I shudder just thinking of it -- to provide for a sequel. ""Mr. Brooks II."" Or maybe, ""Daughter of Mr. Brooks."" Or, how about ""Billy the Kid Meets Mr. Brooks""?",Mr. Brooks
9,ma-cortes,Horror thriller about an elegant psycho-killer well performed by Kevin Costner,7,17 July 2010,"The picture starts with some phrases as : ¨The hunger has returned to Mr Brooks' brain. It never really left ¨. Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner , also producer along with Jim Wilson) is a highly respected family man , successful manager and happily married ( to Marg Helgenberger of CSI).

10,moonspinner55,"Falls apart at the finish line...until then, a crafty and surprising thriller",6,9 October 2011,"Kevin Costner gives one of his freshest performances in years playing a respected business mogul and family man who harbors a dark side; seems he's ""addicted"" to random killing in the same way some people get hooked on drugs, but his most recent bender has left him vulnerable to a blackmailer with an unusual asking price. Director Bruce A. Evans, who also co-authored the screenplay with Raynold Gideon, provides several surprises in this twisted tale, the best of which involves William Hurt; Costner and Hurt play off one another like a bad seed Pinocchio and his evil Jiminy Cricket, and their cackling, confidential rapport gleefully hands Evans a darkly comic undermining which is intriguing all on its own. The story thread with Demi Moore as a put-upon police detective is interesting, although this subplot and at least two others trips the movie up near the end, leading to a lukewarm finish. A stylish updating of the B-picture, one with a macabre, nasty side not usually seen in pricey vehicles for big-name stars. **1/2 from ****",Mr. Brooks
11,blanche-2,A Jekyll/Hyde story,7,3 March 2010,"Kevin Costner is ""Mr. Brooks"" in this 2007 film also starring William Hurt, Demi Moore, and Marg Helgenberger. Costner plays a respected businessman whose alter ego (William Hurt) gives him the urge to kill. Brooks doesn't want to kill, so he attends AA meetings. When the story opens, he has managed to keep from killing for two years. He gives into the urge, though, this time with unhappy consequences for him. He is seen and photographed by a voyeuristic neighbor of the victims, one Mr. Smith (Dane Cook). Mr. Smith got off on what he saw, so he blackmails Mr. Brooks into doing it again. Meanwhile, a determined police detective (Demi Moore) is investigating the homicide.Bruce Evans directed this script, which he co-wrote with Raymond Gideon, and he does a good job. There are a few neat twists. It was disconcerting at first, as the alter ego actually appears on screen, and the two seem to talk out loud in front of others. It then becomes evident that this is all going on in Brooks' mind.The acting is very good. Helgenberger has little to do, but she's stunning. Moore actually has a smaller part than one might expect, too. Costner, Hurt, and Cook have the lion's share of the scenes.Recommended.",Mr. Brooks
12,Quinoa1984,"is too mediocre to be a camp classic, but you might have some laughs at the filmmaker/actors' expense",4,7 June 2007,"Mr. Brooks brings out its bag of tricks early on, but its a bag that's sort of moldy and with the scent of contentment with the average as opposed to more outrageous tendencies. It was a good time for the wrong reasons during the film, a vehicle for Kevin Costner to try to make a grasp at star-defiance of type (instead of a hero he's a killer, woo, big leap), but I wondered if maybe the writers would've fared better if they hadn't gone on to make it a ""legitimate"" thriller. The aspect to the Costner/William Hurt dynamic, where it's a blatantly obvious contrivance of the script where almost every scene without Brooks with a different person in the room or other to talk to is with Hurt's character of Brooks's ego, or Id, or whatever Freudian tick-tack may apply. Some of there scenes, however stupid they might be (including one where Costner cries, have mercy), show some interesting bits and pieces of psychological unease between the two, as if it's been too long that Brooks has listened to his egger-on and doubting Thomas, but still does as the two have wicked laughs at the possibilities of murder and deceit.However, it's director/co-writer Bruce Evans's idea to make Mr. Brooks crammed with the typical elements of a mystery-thriller involving a serial killer, and in some equally expected and inane ways. Demi Moore's character is the given, the tough pro who is saddled with her other motivation that she has to crack the case or else be fired due to a divorce case happening the same time (this is a totally inexplicable plot line made so that Moore can act even more 'tough', and to eventually tie it into the Brooks killing line). Then there's Dane Cook, who doesn't act so much as just use his sort of twitchy 'skills' at acting like he can act to play the almost blackmailing photographer who catches Brooks in the act of killing two of his latest, and then is brought along by Brooks to see someone else get killed. On top of this, we get the 'other wise' to Brooks's life, which is that he's a legitimate businessman and a loving husband and father, the latter of which to a girl who may turn out to be as dysfunctional as him, in the worst ways possible.Instead of possibly giving the characters and developing situations much serious thought, Evans and his co-writer make it all too ridiculous to take as something more interesting, and at the same time tries to make it a conventional thriller to make it experimental. Although Evans isn't necessarily incompetent as a craftsman with the camera- there are, in fact, many well done shots in darkness and silhouettes and other moody scenes of Brooks in his dark home or in thought or Moore swimming in the pool- the story is just too stupid to really make it on either side, with some minor exceptions (the moment when Cook's ""Mr. Smith"" finds the newspaper in the car with the words circled to spell out instructions, to his total anger, is hilarious), and the actors are left with material to flounder in. Cosnter can show his talents from time to time, but again he's saddled himself to a work that might have at some point allowed him for extra room to challenge himself, but in the end he almost challenges his audience to actually see if he has anything, at all, going on emotion-wise, which is next to none. William Hurt takes a nose-dive following his smashing Oscar nomination a couple years ago. Moore is, well, the usual, not bad but nothing more worthy of potential. And Cook is close to being a non-entity in a role that should require more chutzpah.In short, wait for TV, real late night I'm-drunk-and-there's-nothing-else-on TV, for this mainstream clap-trap.",Mr. Brooks
13,edwagreen,Mr. Brooks -Take Me Out to A Killing *,3,11 March 2010,"After all, there has to be some credibility in films. Mr. Brooks is absolutely beyond belief, beside that, it's a pretty miserable film.Kevin Costner, in the title role, is addicted to killing. He stopped but has resumed his mayhem after 2 years. William Hurt plays his alter-ego or the devil sitting in back of his car.The viewer is asked to believe just a little too much. Costner, a successful businessman, is a serial killer. His daughter left college pregnant and is a killer as well. Costner has to kill again so that suspicion is off his daughter. A nut job witnesses one of Costner's killings and wants to ride around with him to pick a victim. He loves killing as well. If this isn't enough, bring in Demi Moore, a cop with 60 million dollars, who is undergoing a messy divorce with a husband and his attorney to harass her. When she follows Brooks, he knows what he has to do regarding the attorney and ex-husband to-be.The ending is even more bizarre than what I've described.

15,hitchcockthelegend,Costner dons a career high in creepy and thematically intriguing skin scratcher.,9,4 March 2008,"I'm doubly delighted after just viewing this skin itcher, firstly I'm thrilled to see Kevin Costner put in a layered performance that even the critics are grudgingly giving kudos too, and secondly I'm thrilled because the film surprised me in tone and structure beyond what I was expecting. This is one of those instances where it really helps to not know anything about the film prior to viewing it, I was aware it was some sort of serial killer type drama, but that was pretty much it, what the genre assignment people here at IMDb forgot to note was that it's also got a deliciously dark comic streak running through it, and that makes this actually something of a multi genre piece.The dark theme of the film keeps it worryingly creepy throughout, it's cynical and disturbing the more the story unfolds, it's got a cute knack of gnawing away at your brain as each frame progresses, it's asking you if you should be smiling or grimacing, and in truth both emotions fit perfectly well for this intriguing couple of hours viewing. It thrills, it worries and yes it is uncomfortable at times, but if you come away from the film not pondering about it then you may of missed the point, and the ending is to me simply wonderful, and again it begs you to think of the consequences.The acting on show is very up and down, Costner & William Hurt are arguably giving career high performances, they actually may be a candidate for the list of best on screen double acts in modern day cinema. Demi Moore does OK, she doesn't harm or enhance the film either way, and although I feel Marg Helgenberger {and the Family axis theme} is underused, she does well enough. The direction is fine, the score is suitably poignant, and the night time shots deliver the money to leave me saying the film is a triumph of the kind we could do with more of these days, 9/10.",Mr. Brooks

If he is anyone like Earl Brooks, it probably would be humanly impossible to ever bring him to justice, since he, like most of the people in this type of business seem to be two steps ahead of the people trying to capture them.Earl Brooks, who is elected Oregon's Man of the Year, leads a double life. As if that was not enough, he has a conscience in the way of an alter ego who is seen with him all the time. Earl, who carefully plots his crime sprees, makes an inconceivable mistake in murdering an exhibitionist couple, who he surprises while making passionate love in a lighted bedroom with all the drapes open for all the neighbors to see.Little does he know his own notoriety will give him away. When a 'peeping tom' who has photographed him at the victims' apartment, comes calling, Mr. Brooks gets a bit rattled. After all, he has not made any tactical errors before. He knows he must deal with this Mr. Smith, as the voyeur calls himself, in an intelligent way: he offers to take him along to witness the next killing.At the same time, a police detective, Tracy Atwood, notices how the bedroom window where the couple was killed faces a building where she believes it's possible for anyone to have seen something. She zeroes in the peeping tom because when she asks him about if he saw anything, he is evasive. Tracy has a problem of her own with her ex-husband. She is in the middle of a messy divorce. Her divorcing spouse wants to hold out for some money.""Mr. Brooks"", co-written and directed by Bruce Evans, offers an interesting premise about a criminal who will get away with murder. The film is entertaining as it keeps the viewer involved in the action. Where the movie fails is in the logistics behind the story and in the police detective who is not credible from the beginning. What would a woman with a fortune of more than sixty million be doing working in such a risky job? For that matter, would a serial killer be advised to attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in order to get a solution for his killing problems, we don't think so.The film gives Kevin Costner a role that is tailor made for his style of acting. He is cool and detached; his Earl Brooks doesn't show any emotion to speak of. In that, the director and his star have done well in creating the perfect atmosphere. William Hurt, or Marshall, the alter ego, compliments Mr. Costner's performance in creating a balance and a reason to counteract Mr. Brook's killing instinct.Demi Moore, unfortunately, is not up to do justice to her character. She appears to be tired all the time. She is not credible as a detective in pursue of the serial killer. Dane Cook, a comedian, is a welcome surprise. His Mr. Smith is one of the best things in the movie.",Mr. Brooks
17,Scarecrow-88,Mr Brooks,9,6 June 2009,"The ""hunger"" has returned(..perhaps it never left, but remained somewhat dormant)to Mr. Brooks in the form of Marshall(William Hurt, in a tour-de-force performance)and it wants him to kill again. Brooks is the wealthy business head of a commercial box company which creates designs for clients. Brooks battles Marshall, who always urges him to kill, both soon deciding on a dancing couple who like to perform sexually with the windows open. Unfortunately for Brooks, he is photographed by a creep, Mr. Smith(Dane Cook)who often spied on the murdered couple, using the pictures to masturbate. Smith, instead of turning in the photos to the authorities, wishes to join Brooks on a murder adventure, feeling very thrilled/excited when he watched that couple gunned down in such a cold-blooded manner. Smith, however, doesn't know who he's messing with, attempting to blackmail Brooks with photographs and memory card, this serial killer is a true professional. Brooks has established a title for his killer, THE THUMBPRINT KILLER..leaving a bloody thumbprint at his crime scenes, always hoping to get caught so that he can stop the killing. Brooks often attempts to drown out Marshall with prayers to God, begging for the addiction to cease, yet the hunger remains always tagging along, their conversations motivating the strategies for future endeavors. Police detective Tracy Atwood(Demi Moore), troubled by a blood-sucking leech ex-husband who wants millions of her estranged father's wealth in exchange for a divorce that disrupts the job's task at hand, is still pursuing THE THUMBPRINT KILLER, while looking over her shoulder for the recently escaped convict, HANGMAN KILLER, she put away. Perhaps Brooks' only equal could be Atwood for she has worked so many of his cases and understands how he works. There's a clever twist in regards to Brooks' next selected couple which concerns Atwood and how he deals with Smith. Brooks contemplates having Smith murder him in a way that would concern his disappearance after their adventure concludes. Also an interesting development with Brooks' daughter Jane(Danielle Panabaker from Nispel's Friday the 13th)emerges indicating she might have the ""killing gene"" which truly disturbs him, also tossing in a curve-ball that disrupts his plans with Smith..how he works this out to ""rescue"" Jane is truly unnerving.Boy, this is a good movie..a really good one. Probably one of the more intelligent, twisted, and imaginative ""sophisticated"" Hollywood thrillers I've seen in a coon's age. Just the idea of tag-along personality Marshall, which Hurt portrays with hearty vigor, accompanying Brooks, offering advice(..even at one point consoling him for chrissakes!)and providing extra incentive(..at times in a very antagonistic way)adds a very unique spin that injects a very wicked flavor that film plays to the hilt. Cook's Smith is a really pathetic creature, a pawn Brooks toys with despite the fact that this cretin could turn him in at any moment. And, interesting enough, Atwood suspects his involvement, figuring he knows more than he will admit. There's a LOT of plot in this movie, with as much emphasis on Atwood's screwy problems as Brooks. Atwood not only has to fend off a lecherous ex-husband(..who's banging his attorney), the convict and his equally vile girlfriend, superiors that want her behind a desk until the personal stuff was taken care of, she also stockpiles the Brooks case on top of all of it. Brooks deals with the hunger, always around, a daughter who has dropped out of college, is pregnant, and could be a serial killer, attempting to avoid being caught, toiling with Smith(..who is putty in his hands really), while remaining undeterred(..without distraction) since his work requires the utmost skill and cunning to remain free from apprehension. Marg Helgenberger co-stars as Brooks' lovely wife, Emma. Unlike other thrillers, Brooks' and Emma are a happily married couple who both contributed to the success the family shares. Jane is a weakness of Brooks' because she knows how to work him over, even though he understands there are secrets she carries that could cause irreparable damage to the family. Lindsay Crouse is Atwood's boss, Captain Lister, and her adviser in matters that interrupt her work.Brooks moves through his victims' apartments like a ghost, well studied in how to approach each selected target(s) when they are vulnerable, a plastic bag over his gloved hand and gun, removing the slugs, cleaning up the crime scene(..fibers, etc)with a vacuum cleaner(..taking the bag with him), leaving his thumbprint as a signifying gesture(..calling card)of whose handiwork the murders were. Brooks often selects victims in the midst of sexual intercourse, startling them, putting slugs in their foreheads. One superb nightmare sequence has Jane burying a pair of scissors in Brooks' throat.",Mr. Brooks
18,Doylenf,Here's a film that definitely deserves the mixed reviews...,6,1 June 2007,"MR. BROOKS is the kind of suspense film that manages to hold your attention from the very start and then, just when you think you know where it's all going, you find out you've been duped. Midway through the film you realize you don't even know where the story is going with its many strands that don't seem to connect.In other words, there's nothing predictable about the outcome but while that would ordinarily be a good thing, here the effect is a handicap because there are too many unexplained elements in the script and too many loose ends. Nevertheless, some of it is very clever and intriguing, a sort of Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde story with KEVIN COSTNER struggling to be good and leave his bad deeds behind him but egged on by his alter ego (WILLIAM HURT) to kill again.What the screenplay fails to do is to connect the three main stories that are being spun into one cohesive whole. As a result, at the end there's a letdown feeling that nothing has really been satisfactorily explained.It's taut and suspenseful and should satisfy most fans of this genre, but it's a psychological thriller that would have been even better with a fully realized script.The performances are fine. KEVIN COSTNER is especially good in some of the climactic scenes after a rather dull beginning but it's DANE COOK as Mr. Smith, the twisted and temperamental photographer who catches a murder on film and has a strange request, that gives the film its most intense moments as he tries to outfox the clever Mr. Brooks.I've liked WILLIAM HURT in many other roles, but find his character more annoying and repelling than merely evil.Summing up: A psychological thriller that is sometimes dull, sometimes riveting as it tries hard to rise above the level of a cluttered script and only partially succeeds. There's a Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde flavor to the whole story. The Demi Moore sub-plot is totally out of whack with the rest of the story.",Mr. Brooks
19,LeonLouisRicci,Dull and Derivative,5,19 October 2012,"A missed opportunity muddled by sloppy subplots and ridiculous characters. The serial killer sub-genre has quite a following and are rarely given much to get excited about and this one is a real letdown.The Star making an effort to play against type is modestly effective as a somewhat detached, hollow, successful family/business man but is bogged down by a lame listless script full of half interesting characters and dialog that is dismally derelict in intelligence or cutting edge humor.The three supporting characters, four if you count the daughter, are all one dimensional, one note, uninteresting and robotic dolts. Their horrible acting on the most part completely disengages the audience from anything but a casual compliance and are accepted as plot procedure to move the ""intrigue"" from one disjointed flat and frequently confusing jumps that are unsatisfying and frustratingly dull and derivative.It is a sophomoric construction of crimes and investigation that is quite frankly on less than even paperback level, and does not deliver any real sharp or clever conceits associated with the usual highly intelligent serial killer that plays games with the police and puzzles both the authorities and the audience.",Mr. Brooks
20,dbborroughs,Costner and Hurt Sshine in this tale of a serial killer,7,26 August 2007,Kevin Costner is a great guy and man of the year sort of fellow who has a dark side-he's a serial killer. On one of the biggest nights of his life Brooks gives in to the voice in his head (played by William Hurt) and begins to kill again. Unfortunately he's spotted by Dane Cook who wants to go out with him on the next kill. Costner hopes there's no next time however circumstance reawakens the old urge and... well thats the movie. Good little thriller is given a great shot in the arm by the interplay of Costner and Hurt.They are the whole movie and are the reason (a really good reason) to watch this movie. Worth a look but you may end up like me and wish that Costner and Hurt would link up again in a movie better suited to let them let go.,Mr. Brooks
21,writers_reign,River Of No Return,7,14 October 2007,"This is arguably Kevin Costner's best film in a long time - I haven't seen too much of his recent work because it was so obviously second-rate/embarrassing but here he's back on track despite a storyline that stretches credibility to breaking point - what are the odds for example that Brooks and Smith would randomly select Atwood's estranged husband and his lawyer as victims or that Atwood would trace Mr Smith to the very fleabag in which the escaped con she put away and who has sworn vengeance is holed up. What carries the viewer along is the understated playing and the novelty of Upright Citizen as Serial Killer when as a rule Serial Killers are dysfunctional loners and almost never Man Of The Year. If it does find itself spinning too many plates in the face of logic - the main strand, Mr. Brook' Jekyll and Hyde existence is supplemented by 1) Mr. Smith witnessing one of his killings and blackmailing him to carry out another to which Smith will be privy, 2)Atwood's personal problems with a divorce settlement, 3)Atwood's life being threatened by the escaped con and 3) Mr. Brooks' daughter apparently bent on replicating her father's sideline - it manages on the whole to keep this kind of logic at bay leaving us to enjoy some fine acting.",Mr. Brooks

23,zardoz-13,"You Won't Get Rooked Watching ''Mr. Brooks!""",8,14 June 2007,"The new Kevin Costner crime movie ""Mr. Brooks"" doesn't qualify as either the best or the most original serial killer thriller ever made, but it is a whole lot of fun, especially if you crave serial killer flicks. Although everything gets more than a mite messy before the end credits roll, this marvelously paced melodrama about cops, criminals, and coincidences will keep you thinking about what happened long after you've left the theater. For example, you won'tif you haven't alreadyput much trust in chain locks that enable you to open your door wide enough when you have to contend with either strangers or obnoxious people bothering you on your own turf. Further, fathers with daughters who want to follow in their footsteps and take over the family business might want to think twice before they discourage their little girls. Finally, if you're over age 30, and you've resigned yourself to prime time television instead of fighting the crowds to sit through another contrived summer sequel with a PG-13 rating, you'll be happy to watch this often amusing, occasionally insightful, but altogether riveting R-rated yarn about a serial killer who knows the difference between right and wrong but cannot help himself.Academy Award winner Kevin Costner gives a hypnotic performance as the title character Mr. Brooks who has amassed a fortune manufacturing boxes for a living. As ""Mr. Brooks"" unfolds, Earl Brooks receives the Man of the Year Award from the Portland, Oregon, Chamber of Commerce and basks in the limelight with his pretty wife Emma (Marg Helgenberger of CBS-TV's ""C.S.I."") during the ceremony. Mr. Brooks looks a bit old fashioned with his bow ties and his black horn-rimmed glasses. Ironically, for an individual who makes boxes, Brooks thinks way outside of the box. For example, he has a running conversation with an imaginary friend called Marshall (William Hurt of ""A History of Violence"") who shares his addiction for murder. Of course, nobody knows anything either about Marshall or the bizarre, after-hours skullduggery that our protagonist indulges in because he cannot help himself. Mind you, having an imaginary character as a sidekick of sorts that our anti-hero can converse with is a little contrived itself, but it's better than having Brooks talk to himself all alone. Sometimes, this oddball relationship generates from good laughs, too. Mr. Brooks doesn't enjoy his obsession with homicide as he reminds Marshall as well as another character in the movie. Indeed, Brooks classifies it as an addiction and attends AA meetings where he only mentions that he is troubled but never details specifics. He likes to recite the serenity prayer when the demons in his mind demand blood on his hands. After a couple of crime-free years, Brooks resumes his psychopathic ways. He breaks into houses, executes couples with a silenced automatic pistol in a plastic bag, poses the corpses together romantically, and then leaves only their bloody thumb prints at the scene. Brooks bags and burns any evidence that might incriminate him until he makes a mistake that he didn't count on despite his master planning. A witness with a 35mm camera, Mr. Smith (Dane Cook of ""Employee of the Month""), catches him after the fact in the act of closing the curtains on the dead couple; the man and woman preferred to share their sexual escapades with their curtains pulled back so that everybody who wanted to could watch them perform. Mr. Smith refuses to hand the evidence over to tenacious, tough-as-nails Portland homicide detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore of ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"") because he wants to accompany Mr. Brooks on his next killing and participate in the crime.Meanwhile, Det. Atwood remains determined to nab Brooks before the FBI can interfere with her investigation. She knows a great deal about his method of operation, but she doesn't have a clue about his madness. When Atwood isn't grilling Mr. Smith because she knows that he saw the crime occur, she has to contend with a ruthless escaped serial killer that she put behind bars as well as a nasty divorce from a slimy husband who screwed everybody else and now wants her to pay him an outrageous sum in alimony.Writer & director Bruce A. Evans and co-writer Ray Gideon {they penned the scripts to ""Starman"" (1987), ""Stand By Me"" (1986),""Kuffs"" (1992), and ""Cutthroat Island"" (1996)}, deliver a solid, bang-up thriller that works itself out a little too neatly in the long run but is nevertheless a frolic from start to finish. They don't sugar coat the crimes, but they make the hero look a little too charming. Unfortunately, aside from telling us that Brooks is addicted to homicide, Evans and Gideon never disclose what makes him the bloodthirsty dastard that he is. When they aren't etching Mr. Brooks' as a portrait of evil, they keep us distracted with a noisy gunfight in an enclosed space that will make you wish that you had worn ear-plugs. They also deliver a razzle-dazzle abduction scene and accompany it with some reckless driving through afternoon traffic that will grab your attention. You probably have to be a bit warped to enjoy this kind of nonsense. After all, you'll inevitably find yourself hoping that Mr. Brooks gets away with his murderous deeds. Demi Moore provides sturdy support as the relentless detective, and Dane Cook is surprisingly good as the repellent Mr. Smith. Lindsey Crouse of ""House of Games"" makes the most of her brief role as Atwood's police captain, while poor Marg Helgenberger is squandered in the peripheral role as Mr. Brooks' spousal unit. As talented as the entire cast is, nobody upstages Kevin Costner. ""Mr. Brooks"" is all about Costner, even when he doesn't appear in every scene. You won't get rooked watching ""Mr. Brooks.""",Mr. Brooks

Traci Dinwiddie. Interesting take on the serial killer thriller with Costner tweaking his clean-cut image as the titular character, a successful businessman, happily married family man whose only trouble is his split-personality obsession of killing anonymous victims. Taut, and slickly directed by Bruce A. Evans, the film only buckles under the other two plot lines involving tenacious cop Moore after 'the Thumb Print Killer'  Brooks' nom de plume  and another serial killer and Brooks' daughter (Panabaker) who harbors her own secrets. Hurt is deliciously evil as Mr. Hyde to Costner's Dr. Jekyll, a la A BEAUTIFUL MIND: a character only Brooks can see & hear, and comedian Cook is better-than-anticipated as a blackmailer cum murderer-wannabe who makes a pact with Brooks: he won't reveal his identity as long as he can be apprenticed to his own desire to kill a stranger.

25,ferguson-6,"Plenty of Hyde, Not much Jeckyl",6,3 June 2007,"Greetings again from the darkness. When a writer/director has a resume that includes ""Kuffs"" and ""Cutthroat Island"", his latest release is of course met with skepticism at best. Bruce Evans takes a solid step forward over those two efforts, but still leaves himself plenty of room to improve.The story is actually fascinating and in the hands of a better writer could actually have been a classic psycho-thriller. Instead, it is a watchable and at times very entertaining effort despite Demi Moore's worst ever performance. From her first scene with Lindsay Crouse through the film's ending, Moore is wooden and totally unbelievable as the millionaire detective.On the other hand, Kevin Costner and William Hurt appear to be having a grand time as yin-yang of Mr. Brooks. Hurt is Costner's thrill seeking alter-ego and the technique of the two sides of the brain carrying on a conversation is quite creepy ... thanks especially to the delicious efforts of Mr. Hurt.Given the quite advanced age (in Hollywood terms) of the three leads, we can't blame the producers from tossing in the appeal to the youngsters with red hot comedian Dane Cook in a pretty impressive dramatic turn. Cook only releases his infamous fury a couple of times and is actually quite believable in this crucial role.Other supporting roles went to Marg Hellenberger (given little to do as Mrs. Brooks) and Amber Tamblyn look-alike Danielle Panabaker who flashes some real acting chops in a dream sequence. Looking forward to more from her.Definitely not at the level of ""Silence of the Lambs"", this one is definitely worth checking out for the scenes with both Costner and Hurt.",Mr. Brooks

This is one of Costner's more compelling roles as he attempts to outwit blackmail while dealing with inner voices. William Hurt plays Marshal as a manic demon pressuring Brooks in his actions. The role is fairly standard yet Hurt makes it his own. Demi Moore plays a cop investigating the murders as well as deal with a messy divorce.

In Mr. Brooks, Costner plays a family man moonlighting as a psychopathic serial killer.Surprisingly, goody goody Costner does a really convincing job as a bad guy! This is one tension-filled thriller, so if the premise is your cup of tea, you'll probably like it. There's one scene that sticks out in my memory as particularly creepy (and this is not spoiling anything): Dane Cook becomes awe-stricken with Costner, and he asks him to mentor him in the ""art of the kill"". I won't spell out the details for you, but they do take a little joyride together and murder someone. Cook's gleeful portrayal in that scene is bone-chilling.

28,gradyharp,A Fascinating Twist on the Subject of Addiction,8,25 October 2007,"MR. BROOKS is a surprisingly good film, one that from the response of critics and audiences at the time of the theatrical release last Spring might make the casual viewer pass by the DVD. But step into this strange world of the successful, philanthropic, loving husband and father Mr. Brooks and discover one of the more clever twists on the themes of addiction and serial killings, courtesy of a smart script by writer/director Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon.Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner, in what may be his best role) has it all: wealth, fame, Man of the Year, a gorgeous home in Portland, a stunning wife Emma (Marg Helgenberger), a perky college freshman daughter Jane (Danielle Panabaker) - and a secret: though he has not been active for two year while attending AA meeting for his addiction to killing, Brooks has a history of being a serial 'Thumbprint' killer. Brooks is accompanied in his darker life by an alter ego Marshall (William Hurt) who encourages him to take up his old addiction to killing 'because he is so good at it'. Brooks follows the need and performs another staged murder of a couple during intercourse. Mistake - he forgets to close the drapes in the room, opening the possibility that he has been seen, a possibility which is realized when he encounters a funky young 'Mr. Smith' (Dane Cook) who just happened to have photographed Brooks' latest adventure and blackmails him into promising to allow 'Mr. Smith' to accompany him on his next murder! Twists and turns occur: daughter Jane returns from college having dropped out apparently because she is pregnant, though there are darker reasons for her move. A spunky detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore), a distraught woman plowing her way through an ugly divorce, takes interest in the newest episode of the return of the Thumbprint killer and faces her own demons from her past experiences as a policewoman. Feeling that Atwood may uncover his crime and thus history, Brooks plans a strange caper that includes 'Mr. Smith' and fearing that daughter Jane may have inherited his bad genes for killing addiction, he takes care of her threatening business before the surprise conclusion of the story.To tell more of the plot would deprive the viewer of the any secrets that unfold in the hands of Brooks and his man Marshall. The story is smart, well scripted, intense, and exciting. And in addition to the very fine performances by the stars, there are excellent cameos by Yasmine Delawari, Aisha Hinds, Jason Lewis, Reiko Aylesworth, and Matt Schulze. Give this poorly reviewed little thriller a chance. It is very much worth watching on every level. Grady Harp",Mr. Brooks
29,zetes,"Rather entertaining, but there are way too many subplots",7,1 January 2008,"Not a great movie, to be certain, but at least I can say it is ambitious and original. Kevin Costner plays a CEO who is driven by his imaginary friend (played by William Hurt) to murder people. On what was supposed to be his last murder, a man from across the street (Dane Cook) witnesses him. Instead of turning him in, Cook blackmails Costner into letting him come along on the next killing. Meanwhile, a millionairess cop (Demi Moore) tracks Costner, and, in another subplot, Costner suspects that his hot, pregnant, 18 year-old daughter may have inherited his murderous tendencies. And then there are two sub-subplots involving Moore, one in which her second husband is taking her to the cleaners in divorce court (remember, she's a millionaire) and another in which an escaped serial killer is trying to get revenge on her for putting him in jail. So, yeah, the film's major problem is that there's way too much going on. It's surprising how well the writers keep it together, though. I would certainly have reduced Moore's character to almost nothing. The whole millionaire cop thing is ridiculous, even more so than the millionaire serial killer (I mean, we can at least imagine someone like that having an unhealthy lust for power of all types). It doesn't help that Demi Moore is a less than mediocre actress in the first place. It's sad to say, in a film co-starring Dane Cook, that Moore gives by far the worst performance. That said, I would also have not cast Dane Cook. He's a spazz, which works okay in the role. But he can't act, and a real actor might have sold it a bit better. Kevin Costner, who seems to be improving with age, is very smooth in the lead. And Hurt is perfect in the role of the devil on Costner's shoulder.",Mr. Brooks

In the end he kills really obnoxious people while helping the very police woman that is hunting him. How can you not love him?Kevin Costner is a good choice for the over intellectual killer with a conscience, while William Hurt plays a small role as his murderous alter-ego. He looks really old, doesn't he? Maybe it's because I've just seen Altered States again these days. Demi Moore has a really irrelevant role for the whole story.Bottom line: a well constructed killer thriller, as seen from the point of view of the murderer.

But I didn't see anything else that looked worth a look, so I figured I would try to give this movie a look and see if it had anything. I just watched it this morning and I have to say that this was a great thriller. I was so incredibly impressed with Costner's performance as Mr. Brooks, he played it so perfectly, one of the best serial killer performances since Kevin Spacey in Se7en. I'm not a fan of Dane Cook, but he actually pulled Mr. Smith off very well. Demi Moore, she did an alright job where she was believable.

He's known as the ""thumbprint"" killer and Detective Atwood is on his case. But one killing he gets caught, by a photographer for in exchange for his silence, Mr. Smith, the photographer, wants to go on to Mr. Brook's next killing. But things get more twisted as we go more into the story.Mr. Brooks is an incredibly brilliant thriller that I was very impressed with. The cast and crew did an amazing job on bringing this horrific story to life. I'm now really interested in reading the book, so I would highly recommend the movie to any thriller lover. Kevin Costner did a perfect job of acting, I can't believe he did so well. Especially his scene where he suspects his daughter of murder, he and William Hurt were incredible.

Earl Brooks(Costner) is a social big wheel and successful business person in Portland, Oregon who's married has a fine home and a daughter only their is another side to him that of a crazy and sick killer. This guy is full of ego and power that his fantasy portion of mind ego has to be acted out. Demi Moore is pretty good as the detective who tries to track him down and solve the murders and some sexy scenes are found in this film. Yet really overall the viewer is left guessing was all this a dream sequence? Was Mr. Brooks really slashed by his daughter? Or was the killing torch passed on to his daughter Jane(Danielle Panabaker)? The film to me just fell flat on drama and didn't really answer any questions certainly by the way it hangs it's viewer out in the end.

He has a trophy wife and college age daughter who is maybe too much like her dad.Demi Moore is a detective who is in pursuit of Brooks but who has another skeleton in the closet who has just been released from jail.This film is quite watchable, but the action & plot twists along with the strong production overwhelms the acting. Costner & Hurt have the strongest roles that survive the best but even Costner has done better in other films acting. While the film is good, one has a feeling it could have been better if all the cast members had gotten better script to work with.The ending reveals something about Mr Brooks daughter or does it? The film leaves that question open ended for the viewer to decide.",Mr. Brooks

36,sddavis63,A Bit Unfocused At Times,5,24 July 2008,"This movie represents a bit of a different type of role for Kevin Costner, who doesn't often get cast as a ""bad guy"" sort of character, and I have to say that while he was all right as Earl Brooks, I thought he at times came across as unconvincing. Earl is a double personality type. By day he's a successful businessman who's been named as Portland, Oregon's man of the year. At night he becomes a ruthless and cold-blooded serial killer, who kills for no particular reason except that he's addicted to killing. At one point he says he doesn't even enjoy killing - it's just an addiction. The addiction angle was stressed by having Brooks as a member of AA. ""My name is Earl, and I'm an addict."" Of course, he never tells the group what he's addicted to! The double personality is represented by Marshall - a character who exists only in Earl's head, and who constantly spurs him on to the next killing. William Hurt was quite good in this role.Had the movie focused more clearly on the psychological aspect of Earl's problem, this might have been much stronger. As it was, I thought the plot got a bit muddled by introducing too many stories within the story. Yes, they do all interconnect eventually, but they kept taking the focus off Brooks. There was Det. Atwood's divorce which only served to bore me quite frankly, partly I suppose because Atwood was played by Demi Moore, who's not exactly at the top of my ""A"" list of actors. Then there's the serial killer out to get Atwood, and the creep who blackmails Earl and the problems faced by Earl's daughter. As I said, thankfully in the end it all got tied together, but I still would have liked the focus to be more squarely on Earl's addiction.One thought that also occurred to me was that the movie seemed to belittle the whole idea of spirituality as an aid to overcoming addiction. Earl prays a lot, and attends AA - which has an overtly spiritual focus - but he still kills. So much for spirituality based addiction programs! The movie's not bad, but it needed a sharper focus in my opinion. 5/10",Mr. Brooks
37,Buddy-51,nice spin on the serial killer formula,7,3 June 2007,"Bruce A. Evans' ""Mr. Brooks"" deserves praise for at least bringing a certain degree of freshness to the well-worn serial-killer genre.Kevin Costner portrays Earl Brooks, a devoted husband and father and the recent recipient of the Portland, Oregon Man of the Year Award for his work as a successful businessman. He also just happens to be a cold-blooded murderer, known to the media and the law enforcement community as the Fingerprint Killer, so named because he leaves that telltale sign behind at each of his crime scenes (we must assume it is not his own fingerprint, although the script never actually spells that out for us). As the movie opens, Brooks hasn't killed anyone for two years, having chosen to resist the temptation by attending AA meetings and focusing on his wife and daughter. However, lately, Brooks has begun to succumb to the pull of his ""addiction,"" once again allowing his darker angel to lure and goad him into seeking out unsuspecting victims as a means of alleviating the pressure.What separates ""Mr. Brooks"" from all other previous serial-killer thrillers is that it has chosen to actually incarnate that bad angel on screen in the form of an unnerving William Hurt, who appears by Brooks' side at strategic moments in the movie to advise, berate and commiserate with Brooks as he contemplates his next homicidal action. Generally, in these movies, we rarely get a sense of the intense mental struggle taking place within the deeply disturbed, psychotic mind of the killer. Through the use of Hurt's character (referred to as Marshall), however, the writers, Evans and Raynold Gideon, are able to verbalize that conflict and show us the two warring factions co-existing within this single warped psyche. Despite the absurdity of it, Brooks truly believes that his ""condition"" can be ""cured"" if he regularly and faithfully attends a self-help group for alcoholics. Thus, against our better judgment, perhaps, we find ourselves almost feeling sorry for the man, a position one rarely finds oneself in in a tale such as this one.The complex plot also includes a wannabe young killer (Dane Cook) who blackmails Brooks into taking him out on his next killing spree; an expert homicide investigator (Demi Moore) who was investigating the Fingerprint Killer case until the trail turned cold; and Brooks' own college-aged daughter, Jane (Danielle Panabaker), who may have inherited her dad's killer ""gene"" and might just possibly have a murder or two of her own to account for.The storyline may not always pass the credibility threshold (particularly in the suggestion that psychosis might have a genetic component and can be passed down from generation to generation), but the cleverness of the approach and the genuine creepiness of many of the scenes go a long way towards mitigating the imperfections. Moreover, Costner, Hurt, Moore and Cook give spellbinding performances as the killer and the various persons and pseudo-persons caught in the bloody web he has woven.Working as a team, Costner and Hurt bring complementary opposing qualities to their roles which, when taken together, add up to a single, well-rounded character. In a complex variation on the Jekyll and Hyde, Faust and Mephistopheles dichotomy, Costner conveys the poignancy and vulnerability of the ""good"" Brooks, while Hurt shows us the steely-eyed cold-heartedness of the ""bad"" Brooks. Yet, there are times when even those roles switch, as when Costner coldly laughs at the prospect of a victim's potential suffering and Hurt provides words of comfort to a hurting Costner.Together, the two talented stars create a complex symbiotic relationship that lifts ""Mr. Brooks"" several rungs above the ordinary.",Mr. Brooks
38,thesar-2,Brooks and Done,10,17 February 2013,"Way back in 2008ish, my boss told me about Mr. Brooks. I have never heard of it, and despite some solid performances in his career, I was a self-proclaimed dislike'r of Kevin Costner. Butsomehow I trusted my boss's judgment.To this day, I still want to thank him. This movie is marvelous. Fantastically written, interesting and deep. It screams ""Based on a novel (or novels) by"" but, to my shock it was just an original screenplay. That kind of saddened me; I wanted to buy this book right away.Speaking of being well written, this movie is all over the place and yet in one direction – and that's a compliment. For two hours that in no way feels that long, the intertwining stories are so interesting, the time flies.And all the performances, sans Dane Cook, were excellent. Not to be harsh, and he was mildly good for what he needed to do, but the choice to book him for this was, eha bad one.Next-Door-Neighbor-type: Mr. Brooks (Kevin Costner) is a ""recovering addict"" ofmurder. Worse, he's got a persona following him around, with the name ""Marshall"" (William Hurt – by far, the best performance in the movie) who plays the role of little, red devil on the shoulder fairly well. Oh, I forgot to mention, he's also a ""from the ground-up"" chief executive officer of a box company and family man.Well, things go south when Mr. Brooks falls off a two-year ride on the wagon and a ""Mr. Smith"" (Cook) not only notices the murder but wants to become the next Mr. Brooks.Believe me when I say: those little tidbits of a synopsis are incredibly minute to what all goes on in the movie. I even left out major character/players so you can discover this gem's full potential all out on your own, like I did from my boss's recommendation.I love suspense, mystery, horror, but most of all: I love an interesting, original and deep script with fantastic characters. This satisfied a great deal of all my yearnings for a good time at the movies. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",Mr. Brooks

Not in him trying to cure or overcome his drinking problem but his addiction to murdering people.Just when he felt he had it licked in pops his evil other self Marshall, William Hurt, to put the hurt on him in getting Mr.Brooks to do one more job for him in order to quench his thirst for blood! Going out for one last time to do his thing in murdering couples engaged in sex and leaving his trademark thumbprint at the scene of the crime Mr.Brooks breaks into an apartment and offs a pair of lovers to the delight, who seemed to get turned on by it, of his evil other self Marshall! Being out of action and a bit rusty Mr.Brooks made one unforgivable mistake and that was leaving the curtains open for someone across the street not only to see him murder the pair but also photograph the crime: The friendly neighborhood pervert and Peeking Tom Mr. Barrett, Dane Cook.Mr. Barrett or Mr.Smith as he now calls himself shows up at Mr.Brooks office building with a number of incriminating photos of Brooks in action. Feeling at first that Mr.Smith is blackmailing him Brooks is willing to pay him off but soon realizes that he in fact wants him to go out and kill another couple while in the act of having sex! Mr. Smith was so turned on by watching Books murder the couple next door that he want's to experience that same high again!Brooks is later faced with the dilemma that his own flesh & blood daughter Jane, Danielle Panabaker, has taken after him in being suspected in murdering, with an ax, a fellow student in Stanford University! Before Brooks satisfies both Mr. Smih and his evil alter ego's Marshall blood-lust he has to go to Standford and murder, with an ax, another student there! That's for him to take the heat off Jane who'll have an air-tight alibi,by being over 100 miles away when the murder was committed,in not only not murdering the person that her daddy knocked off but in not being suspected in the murder that she did commit! In the cops thinking that both killings were done by the same person. In fact they were done by two, father & daughter, of the same family members!It's when lady Portland police detective Tracy Atwood, Demi Moore,is put on the case that things get really screwed up in her mistakingly thinking that Mr.Smith is in fact the ""Thumbprint killer"" not Mr.Brooks. It's that Mr.Smith is so eager to take the credit for Brooks' crimes that he leaves himself open to suspicion by the Portland PD in Brooks' killings. When Mr.Brooks finally commits another double murder, with an eager as a beaver Mr.Smith present, of non other then Tracy's sleazy ex-husband Jesse Vialo, Jason Lewis, and his both lover and shyster lawyer Shelia, Reiko Aylesworth,that he sets Mr.Smith up to in fact murder him, against Marshall's strong objections, to finally put him out of his misery!The film is then interrupted by the escape from prison of ""The Hangman"" Thorton Meeks, Mah Schulze, who's looking to get even with Tracy for capturing him and putting Meeks behind bars. This all leads to a wild shootout at ""The Hangman's"" hideout, which happens to be Mr.Smith new place of residence, with ""The Hangman"" and his busty moll Sunday,Yasmine Delawari, getting blown away by a pumped up and out of control, in shooting first and asking questions later, Tracy! In the end Mr.Brooks changes his mind in continuing his killing spree by killing the one person, besides the invisible to everyone but Mr. Brooks' other self Marshall, who's been egging him on! The by now flushed with success,in getting Mr. Brooks to do whatever he wants, Mr.Smith! Not only did Brooks knock off Mr. Smith but also framed him for all the killings that he committed as the notorious ""Thumbprint Killer"" as well!

40,FeastMode,my notes,6,24 June 2019,"Pretty good, not great. some of it was predictable. but good story and portrayal of the mind of a serial killer (1 viewing)",Mr. Brooks
41,Robert_duder,Quite possibly the best movie of the year,10,23 June 2007,"""If I were here to kill you, you would already be dead."" These haunting words are spoken by someone I think I may come to remember as one of the greatest characters in cinema history...Mr. Earl Brooks. I have been a fan of Kevin Costner's for a very long and was quite pleased to see that it appeared he was moving out of his recent slump with 'The Guardian' opposite Ashton Kutcher but in my books Mr. Brooks puts Costner back on my own tops list because the film was absolutely incredible. A man torn between two sides of himself, no heroes in this film, no decisive right or wrong answer but simply this man with two very distinctive sides trying to fight his addiction to kill in the same way anyone else would handle an addiction. The reviews are right a lot of the clever dialog and witty banter comes from the internal conversations that take place between Costner's character and the eagerly murderous William Hurt's character but there is so much going on with everyone in the film. Brooks has this entire 'normal' life with a wife and a child who is dealing with a real life problem so that (in my own opinion) Brooks fabricates an issue with her that she can deal with. That is the beauty of this film, brilliantly intelligent, horrifyingly gory, brilliantly acted...one of the best films I have seen this year.As mentioned Kevin Costner plays Mr. Earl Brooks in perhaps one of his best performances to date. Brooks has incredible character arc and this feeling of self pity that almost makes the viewer feel sorry for him until he does something else stupid. This other side of him is so convincing you hardly believe he's a killer and you know right from square one that he is!! Costner should get an Oscar nomination for this role hands down!! Brilliant!! Second in the cast is Dane Cook in a very unusual turn as slightly more neurotic 'Mr. Smith' as he's known. His request to Costner's Brooks is almost more disturbing than even the things Brooks pulls off. Cook plays his character far more disturbed, angry, hellbent on murder and doesn't play the calm demeanor of Brooks at all...he's like the polar opposite despite Brooks twisted efforts to mentor him in killing. Cook and Costner are great together in there roles. William Hurt has one purpose in the film and he immediately raises the quality of the film and makes it worth while. Hurt plays Costner's murderous alter ego Marshall who conveniently plants himself behind Costner in almost every situation and gives his two cents. In some cases he simply helps Costner work things out in every day life and in other situations Costner turns to him for safety and encouragement in doing what he doesn't want to do...kill. Their back and forth banter is just classic and they play off each other so well and Hurt is brilliant and probably deserves an Oscar nod as well. Demi Moore is Detective Tracy Atwood who is determined to track down Costner (not knowing who he is of course.) Many reviewers have suggested that Moore's character and story is too drawn out and unnecessary but I disagree. Tracy Atwood is someone that Brooks relates to. He sees in her someone trying to deal with real life problems in a conventional way and failing so he shows her in his own way that his way 'works.' Moore looks incredible and plays her part well. I would like to have seen and hope to see in future installments of the film more banter and connection between Brooks and Atwood. Their phone call at the end is priceless. Marg Helgenberger and Danielle Panabaker are Brooks' finally respectively. They both do a decent job although small roles and Panabaker whom I love on TV's shark is really making a name for herself.Rumor has Costner saying that the Brooks' films are a trilogy and I couldn't be any happier hearing that although the film seems to be doing rather averagely at the box office. I encourage and insist on anyone seeing this powerhouse film because there is so much to it that you may even miss some of it the first time around. Costner's performance nothing short of breath taking and this character is chilling and disturbing and an absolute must see and the film is definitely no holds barred violent and gratuitous including a rather graphic sex scene prior to murder. As 'R' Rated as it is the film is one of the best to date I have seen and definitely a sleeper success in my books!! 10/10",Mr. Brooks
42,Lejink,Mister boat (get it?),3,21 December 2007,"As weird a supposed thriller as I've seen in a long time and none of it remotely convincing or exciting. For your money you get about four murderers (or would-be murderers)although you're not sure about Kevin Costner's daughter, the old ""Silence of the Lambs"" ploy of using a killer to catch a killer is re-engaged, plus past their sell-by date actors like William Hurt, Kevin Costner and Demi Moore try to give life to a plot with more holes than Gorgonzola and more coincidences than a Thomas Hardy novel. Credulity was lost for me at the first sight of William Hurt as Costner's personified inner demon (as a cinematic device, it just doesn't work) and fell off the track completely when the one witness to Costner's first murder turns out to be a wacko voyeur who wants in on the act with him. Throw in Demi Moore as a millionaire (I kid not!) career cop whose philandering grasping ex-husband somehow gets embroiled in the convoluted plot and gets just desserts with his naturally glamorous attorney, all the time proving herself as invulnerable to harm as Superman, as tough-talking as Kojak and as intuitive as Sherlock Holmes and you get the cartoonish effect it all conveys. The actors for me barely engage with the material (no wonder) although I doubt Olivier, Brando and Garbo could have done anything with this tosh.",Mr. Brooks
43,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,A dark and unusual film that goes in directions you don't quite expect it to,9,31 March 2008,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner) is a successful businessman and loving husband and father. But he hides a horrifying secret from everyone around him- by night he sometimes gives in to his urges and, lead on by his imaginary friend Marshall (William Hurt) he becomes a psychopathic killer, randomly slaughtering strangers in their homes. Unfortunately (for him) there has been a witness to his latest crime, Mr Smith (Dane Cook.) His ransom demand? To come along on his next kill. This doesn't go well with the fact that tough female detective Atwood (Demi Moore) is closing in on his trail.Over here in the UK, serial killers have been back in the news a bit lately, with the recent convictions of Steve Wright for the Suffolk prostitute murders and Levi Bellfield for the 'bus-stop' murders. Whether that makes it in bad taste or timely to watch a film like Mr Brooks is down to individual opinion but then this is not your typical serial killer film.Rather than follow the standard 'killer on the loose, detective follows the clues, tracks him down' plot line, Mr Brooks tries to delve into the complex mind of a serial killer and what motivates seemingly normal people who look perfectly respectable on the outside to do it. Sure, we watch a lot of Moore's character on the trail of him while also dealing with the subplot of her own problems with a paroled killer, but more is devoted to watching Mr Brooks battle his own internal conflicts and rationale for being a killer, even attending Addictions Anonymous sessions to battle his urges without, of course, daring to tell the people he is with what he attends for. This gives it an unusual and unsettling feel that takes the film in directions you certainly don't expect it to.Performances wise, Costner is well up to the job here, turning in an unusually dark performance that he manages much better than you'd expect. All the supporting cast are also fine, especially Hurt as Brooks's weird imaginary friend, even more disturbing as he eggs his dreamer on to do what he does as we never learn his origins or why Brooks would think of such a man in the first place.One thing that didn't wash with me, unfortunately, was the ending. I'm not sure if it was trying to be clever or post modern in any way, but to me it failed to round the film off properly and give it any sense of closure. But then, this wasn't a normal film to begin with, so expect a weird, but wholly original and satisfying ride. ****",Mr. Brooks
44,bowmanblue,More that's right than wrong,8,29 April 2019,"The word that springs to mind when I watch 'Mr. Brooks' is 'messy.' Now, that probably normally means that if a film is a complete mess then it's not worth watching. However, this one may be one of the few exceptions to the rule.The titular character is played by Kevin Costner and is a completely normal man - on the outside. He has a great job, a loving wife and an intelligent daughter. Unfortunately, he's also a completely insane serial killer who hallucinates a 'partner' in crime - another man, 'Marshall,' played by William Hurt. Therefore the film could be about him (or should I say the TWO of them?) going on their killing sprees. It isn't. Or it only is a little bit.This is what I mean when I say that 'Mr. Brooks' is a mess. For a film that's only two hours long, it tries to condense numerous story-lines and plot threads into one film. If I didn't like the film so much I'd be tempted to offer more examples of this, but then I'd run into 'spoiler territory,' but I will say there's a cop on his heels (Demi Moore), a blackmail element, his daughter's problems and an ex husband and former prisoners of Ms Moore. That's quite a lot. I guess this is an example of when a story had nowhere else to go than the big screen to be made. I get the impression that if 'Mr. Brooks' was pitched now, it would more likely get an entire series dedicated to it on Netflix. That way all these elements would be allowed their own time to grow and be fleshed out, rather than rushed in order to be concluded within the film's run-time.Also, I'm not normally a fan of either Kevin Costner or Demi Moore, but I'm glad to say that neither ruins the film at all. Well, Costner is excellent and shows why he was once one of Hollywood's most bankable stars. Moore does look a little out of place being a tough, hard-as-nails detective who is capable of taking down ruffians twice her size! But the 'real' star of the show is William Hurt as the completely imaginary - 'Marshall.' He is totally one dimensional in his insane desire to murder for fun and is a sheer joy to watch. Probably could have done with him in it even more instead of some of the other plot-lines.Anyway, 'Mr. Brooks' will probably never be remembered as a classic as all stars have got together a little too late after they had their turn centre stage. Plus, as I've already stressed, the plot is a little all over the place for the story to be truly as gripping as it definitely should be. However, it does seem to have gathered quite a cult following. So, if you're in a bit of a forgiving mood and are ready for some plot threads to be a little more rushed than they probably should, give this one a go.",Mr. Brooks
45,dromasca,surprising and disturbing crime thriller,7,1 January 2014,"'Mr. Brooks' is a curious combination. The casting succeeds to bring together on screen a few big stars just a fraction of second after the peaks of their careers (5 or 10 years before 2007 this film would probably have been to expensive to make because of the salaries of the actors). Set in the very urban landscape of Portland, it has a very 'big studios' look which combined with a story that seems to walk dangerously on the edge of melodrama made me think for a while that this will not be the last-viewed-in-2013 film I asked for. However, some place in the middle of the film the several rather conventional parallel threads start making sense and enhance the effect of each other. This seems to be the merit of director Bruce A. Evans who is also the co-writer of the script which seems to have been long in cooking and not easily accepted by the studios. For some good reasons from their point of view, which may be part of the reasons I liked it.The story: Successful businessman Mr. Brooks (Kevin Costner) has it all (prosperous business, beautiful wife, loving daughter in college, the villa of anybody's dreams) but also a double life. He kills at night, he is actually a serial killer who murders because of an addiction, and does it in the same quite, smart and organized manner he is running his business and his whole life which allows him to never get caught. He would quit killing but his dark side alter-ego would not let him (William Hurt), he is even some kind of Catholic praying to avoid sin all over the film. When he eventually makes one mistake the police-woman in charge with his case (Demi Moore) gets dangerously close, and a young pervert who photographed his last murder blackmails him into becoming his partner. Things get even more complicated, as the police-woman is entangled in an ugly divorce, and Brook's daughter is in deep trouble having inherited some of her dad's night habits. Will he be able to solve all these? Will he use the big talent we all know he has - being a serial killer? I will not tell more because there is much to enjoy in this film and I would not like to discourage folks who happen to read this. I will just say that not only things come together surprisingly well from a story line point of view and the whole is much better than the parts, but that we also end as viewers by understanding the actions of the hero and to some extent sympathize with him (although in real life we would not have any reasons to do it). Kevin Costner's acting is certainly part of the reason, and having him paired with William Hurt creates a couple with a formidable magnetism. Demi Moore also makes best of a role which is usually schematic in many movies but proves here to be more complex than expected. The telling of a disturbing story in a fluent and intelligent manner combined with the mid-high class setting makes for highly efficient cinema. It's like when you taste a meal and it is spicy and surprising although you know it was prepared from many banal ingredients you can find in any supermarket. Bruce A. Evans is very scarce in his directing experiences. This film made in 2007 is actually only his second film, the first one was made in 1992! I really hope that we'll not have to wait another 15 years to elapse until his next.",Mr. Brooks

47,tabuno,An Excellent Psychological Crime Thriller,8,21 January 2019,"4 June 2007. Several brilliant moments occur in Mr. Brooks, a deeply disturbing psychological thriller that hits several controversial buttons by speculatively looking inside the schizophrenic mind of a serial killers. The deliciously creepy synchronized smiles that begin occurring on William Hurt's and Kevin Costner's faces midway into the movie is like pouring a smooth, sickly sweet evil coating over the audience smothering them in rich, sticky creepiness. The loud and very realistic gunshots towards the end of the movie are some of the most effective special effects shots from any movie. The beginning, however, missed an opportunity to go for ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""A Beautiful Mind"" possibility to make the twist part way into the movie a real treat, thus the beginning was a bit watered down. The musical score of the movie was very effective and the photography great. The entire element of twisted dysfunctional rot was unmistakable, but even more coolly clever was that Kevin Costner's character unlike Hannabil Lector played by Anthony Hopkins who made brilliant evil into something likable, Kevin's performance was much more poignant and powerful by its incredible polar pull of good, sympathizing, evil and repulsive. In today's black and white society, it is so often difficult to realize the blurry gray. Demi Moore plays it straight in this movie. What was both commendable and confusing was the number of separate plots going on, interweaving, the merely coincidental and deliberate intersections in this movie. There are a number of threads that seem to flail off into more grayness. Overall, this was an effective psychological portrayal of heinous criminal violence along with a richly deep emotional humanity tucked inside with real world elements of unknown endings along the trimmings. It was also fun to watch Lindsay Crouse as Captain Lister from ""Buffy: The Vampire Slayer"" fame as Professor Maggie Walsh and Reiko Aylesworth who played Demi Moore's husband's lawyer from ""24"" as Michelle Dessler.

This is a campy but entertaining thriller, a film one might put on one's list of guilty pleasures. Costner is OK as the title character. The alter-ego is actually played by another actor (Hurt), which is silly, but perhaps better than having a running narration informing the viewer what Costner is thinking. It's not clear whether Moore can't act, is miscast, or her character, a multi-millionaire who works as a detective for kicks(!), is too ridiculous for any actress to make a success of. It's fun as long as one doesn't take any of it seriously.",Mr. Brooks

Plot In A Paragraph: Earl Brooks (KC) is a successful business man, who has just won Man Of The Year who also happens to have a murderous alter ego known as the thumbprint killer.I think Mr. Brooks is a brilliant movie, filled with fantastic performances, a great script (Kevin Costner thought the script was one of the most perfect scripts he'd ever read.) and solid directing. How this movie failed to find an audience is beyond me. It's funny movie to be rooting for a serial killer, but the way KC plays him as a tortured soul has you wanting him to succeed. Dane Cook, who I have never been a fan of, is OK as the buffoon who decides to blackmail a serial killer. As for Demi Moore, I'll admit from the off, that I am bias. I love her. I have had a crush on her since the 80's, and will usually give anything she is in a chance. she remains one of the most talented, under rated and beautiful women in movies, and her ladylike sexiness is in rare supply. For this Zoner any movie becomes promising just by having her name in it's cast.According to interviews at the time of the movie's release with KC said this was supposed to be the first movie in a trilogy. It's a real shame this never found an audience and We never got to see more of Mr Brooks and Detective Atwell.",Mr. Brooks
50,UniqueParticle,One of my favorite dark films,10,18 April 2021,"Kevin Costner, William Hurt, and Dane Cook are exceptional throughout! I'm shocked Bruce A. Evans hasn't done more than Kuffs and Mr. Brooks he's superb at his craft. Such a twisted story about an masterful killer whom is trying to better himself even though he's got a haunting presence at least for Brooks it is. The soundtrack is one of my favorites ever, I so love it and take quite a bit of comfort in this drama/thriller! Brooks try to better himself which is the prime reason William Hurt wanted the part.",Mr. Brooks
51,Thanos_Alfie,Alter ego...,6,17 January 2020,"""Mr. Brooks"" is a Crime - Thriller movie in which we watch a well-respected businessman (he was named Portland's Man of the Year) who has a big and terrible secret. Sometimes he is controlled by his murder and mayhem-loving alter ego. He tries his best to control it and he has been attending AA meetings in order to control his addiction of killing even harder. Everything changes when after killing a couple he is seen and photographed by someone.I liked this movie because I found it interesting with a nice plot and some good interpretations made by its cast. I also enjoyed the direction which was made by Bruce A. Evans and I believe that he did an excellent job at it. Regarding the interpretations, Kevin Costner who played as Mr. Earl Brooks was simply amazing and his acting for one more time was very good, William Hurt who played as Marshall was equally good and the differences between the two characters made the movie even more interesting. I believe that Demi Moore who played as Detective Tracy Atwood made an average performance and she didn't reach its potential.Finally, I have to say that ""Mr. Brooks"" is a nice movie with many good scenes, an interesting plot with some surprises and I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it.",Mr. Brooks
52,zkonedog,"A Creepy, Thoughtful Thriller",9,12 March 2017,"The psychology of serial killers is a topic well-represented in film. Perhaps no film does this in a more interesting way than ""Mr. Brooks"".For a basic plot summary, ""Mr. Brooks"" tells the story of Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner), a respected business owner, who just happens to harbor a mysterious secret: he is a serial killer. He may not be proud of his actions, but he is addicted to the thrill. This part of his conscience is represented by Marshall (William Hurt), a figure that Brooks can only see but allows him to have a running dialogue. During one murderous spree, however, Brooks is caught in the act by photographer Mr. Smith (Dane Cook) and blackmailed into continuing his violent ways. On the trail of both men is Detective Altwood (Demi Moore).Easily the hallmark of this film is the metaphor that murderous impulses in a human being are like another literally part of the psyche (Hurt's character). It is intriguing to watch Brooks and Marshall go back and forth on these issues, fully knowing that the whole thing is really taking place in Brooks' mind. This is a fascinating take on serial murders that I've never really seen before or since in film.Another very interesting angle is one involving Jane (Danielle Panabaker), Brooks' daughter. I can't talk about this one too much for fear of spoilers, but suffice it to say that it adds even another layer of depth to the complexity of Brooks' psyche. We all wonder what kind of legacy we'll leave behind for our family...even serial killers?The only reason I drop this film down to 9 stars instead of the full 10? Cook's character doesn't work at all. Cook is clearly miscast in the role, and his character's intentions are a bit hackneyed from the very beginning. I realize that his character is needed to push the plot forward, but I just wish it would have been better conceived or thought out more realistically.All things considered, however, ""Mr. Brooks"" is one of my favorite psychological thrillers of all- time. The themes present and the creepy acting really stand the test of time, and it is such a unique take on some dark material. Costner can, in some instances, get a bad rap for being a bit wooden in his acting roles, but he is the perfect lead for this endeavor.",Mr. Brooks
53,leplatypus,sickening but  (dad),4,22 January 2017,"I put this movie in the bin along Crash, Irresistible, Hannibal because i just blame the efforts and dedication to put inhuman, horrible violence and pain into an art object! Those movies prove that there's something wicked in our societies, a sort of dark cancer that kills our most positive and beautiful things! So here we are the voyeur of a serial killer and as the bad Beautiful Mind, it's suggested that he is not that responsible as he is managed by a vicious buddy! Things got really worse as he must become the mentor of his blackmailer and also because his madness is hereditary! For one time, we have the usual Clichés of the American movie torn in a different light (the wealthy boss, the happy family) but maybe what makes the difference here is the quality of the cast: Costner the good guy by excellence is excellent as well as Hurt (he looks like the Yellow bastard from Sin City), as Moore (even if always cold, athletic, tough) with a special mention for Dane Cook, the could be son of Fletch who adds here to his cool attitude a real ability for drama too!",Mr. Brooks
54,Anonymous_Maxine,I'm just trying' to be a better person. My name is Earl...,9,10 March 2008,"I have a feeling that Mr. Brooks is going to be difficult for the more narrow-minded moviegoers to accept. Sadly, Kevin Costner is one of those actors who carries an iconography that makes it difficult for a great many people to accept him in certain roles, similar to people like John Travolta or even Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. But the thing is, all of them are tremendously talented actors, and the constant bickering that I associate with their names stems from the guys I used to work in the video store with for a year or so after I finished high school. I never understood their immediate condemnation of the new Pitt of DiCaprio movies, which most often I watched myself and loved (with the exception of The Beach, of course).I had immediate reservations about accepting Costner as a serial killer myself (not the least reason for which is that I just watched Dances with Wolves again a couple weeks ago and haven't seen A Perfect World in maybe 15 years), but I watched the trailer and decided to give it a chance. Having done so, it's easy to understand the criticisms, but sad that these people were so focused on anything negative they could find, because it made them miss out on what is undeniably a taught, fascinating and brilliantly written and acted thriller. Yes, the relationship between Costner's Mr. Brooks and William Hurt's character, and the very existence of Hurt's character in the film, is some pretty thin cinematic ice, as is the concept of treating killing as an addiction, like alcohol or drugs. But the reason this works is because Costner and Hurt have genuine on screen chemistry and for many people, killing is done for a thrill. Mr. Brooks is just a guy who no longer wants that thrill, just like people who no longer want to drink, even though it makes them feel so good.Killing as an addiction is an extremely difficult concept to sell and the movie never really pulls it off completely, so instead it relies on high entertainment, outstanding performances and a simply brilliant script, and you know what? That's just fine with me. Personally, I found it harder to believe that the one time Mr. Brooks made a mistake, he ended up getting photographed by an amateur photographer who just happens to share his lust for blood. RIGHT.(spoilers) There are definite weak moments in the film, it's far from perfect, but after re-thinking the entire movie, the only moment that really takes away from the film is not Demi Moore (OR her character's divorce), it's not Brooks' daughter committing murder herself (she DID do it, or at least was certainly criminally involved), and it's not Hurt as the physical manifestation of Mr. Brooks' rationalizing ego. The only thing that just doesn't fit is that bizarre techno shootout near the end, which looks like it would be more at home in a music video. It just came out of nowhere and went nowhere.And by the way, some have complained that we're supposed to ""feel sorry"" for Demi Moore's Detective Atwood for having to give up one or two million dollars when she is worth more than $60 million. Her conflict is not the money. This is made obvious by the fact that, as it is mentioned directly through dialogue, she doesn't do her job for the money. Her conflict is that her husband is a total dirtbag and she doesn't want to give him a dime. I would feel exactly the same. In many parts it's hard not to crack jokes, or at least think of cracking jokes (""Hello, my name is Earl and I'm a killaholic...""), but to write this movie off because of it's weak, if numerous, shortcomings is a terrible mistake. It is inarguably one of the most original thrillers to come along in a good number of years and it's a tremendous accomplishment for everyone involved. Bravo!",Mr. Brooks
55,jzappa,Applause For Its Edginess,8,15 June 2007,"The main thing about Mr. Brooks that I love is that it is so convincing in its portrayal of the internal workings of a certain sort of mind, almost as if it were an inside story. Mr. Brooks is a character who is completely unsuspecting to anyone observing him, yet he is a completely different person beneath the skin. He is much more complex than a lot of mainstream audiences will realize upon first viewing. He has deep feelings for his family, which means he's capable of deep feelings. Yet he is completely aware of his manipulative and destructive capabilities and intermittently cannot help himself and must take advantage of them. I think the script is a truly brilliant rendering of a very realistic sort of personality that is so secretive that they can be found throughout the range of all human activity.Kevin Costner having always been one of the most wooden actors in contemporary movies, I am very impressed that he hit the nail on the head with this very challenging and multi-layered character of Mr. Brooks, and in understanding him completely knew just how much of him to reserve for William Hurt's share, Hurt playing a figure nonexistent to anyone in the film other than Costner, representing the deepest, darkest thoughts of Mr. Brooks. The script and direction are very clear-cut and discern the dialogue between Costner and Hurt as the same character and not a split personality.Demi Moore is affecting in her portrayal of a cop whose personal life calls upon the part of a personality that would urge with anger towards thoughts of murder and is able to suppress them. It's maybe my favorite of all the performances I've seen of hers. There is lots of subtext in what appears to be a token cop role.The most interesting casting choice, aside from the impressive comebacks by two aging former box-office magnets, is of comedian Dane Cook as a blackmailing witness to one of Mr. Brooks's murders. His character is a creative blend of voyeuristic and eagerly putzy, and Cook pulls it off very becomingly.As well as being a very gripping and unpredictable celebration of evil, I think a lot of extra credit is due to this film especially for holding its own at the box office during a summer of conglomerate box-office hogs like the second sequels to Pirates of the Caribbean, Shrek, Ocean's Eleven, and Spider-Man when it is actually very edgy and takes a lot of risks as a mainstream film.",Mr. Brooks
56,robert-temple-1,Mr. Brooks and Mr. Hyde,7,29 June 2011,"The box advertises this DVD as 'the best serial killer thriller in years'. Is that a compliment? It is a bit like saying that Hitler was a 'better' mass murderer than Genghiz Khan, isn't it? (I assume a 'better' mass murderer is one who kills more people, is that right? Or did Genghiz Khan kill more people than Hitler, so that therefore he is 'better' than Hitler?) When one uses words like 'the best' there is an implication that something which is 'the best' is also good. Does it makes any sense therefore to speak of the 'best' bad thing? What does that mean? Is the 'best bad thing' really the worst thing? The question arises: should people be making serial killer thrillers at all? As I have said many times, I do not believe they should. So, having pointed out that the genre should be abandoned and that the film should not have been made, we can turn to whether it has been made well or not. Then we can see whether, within its tainted genre, it is 'the best', or at least 'good', in its badness. I can safely say, to the great satisfaction of all the actors and others involved in the production, that it is very 'good' indeed, and may even be 'the best in years'. It is extraordinarily ingenious, and immense cleverness has gone into writing, directing, and producing it. If only all that effort could have been put into something wholesome instead! The brilliant device of having the main character's violent alter ego, his 'Mr. Hyde', played by a live actor works superbly. The main character is played by Kevin Costner, and his alter ego is played by William Hurt, in one of the finest performances he has ever given. Although Costner is extremely good as well, Hurt outshines him. Costner suffers from 'an addiction to killing', as he calls it, and he even goes to AA sessions where he stands up and says: 'I am an addict', though he never says addicted to what. He is constantly striving to be a good person and stop killing, but his alter ego keeps appearing to him to make him resume it, and they chat amicably as old friends, and the scenes where they interact are astonishing. It is all so very clever, though directly derived from Robert Louis Stevenson, and merely updated and made trendy. Demi Moore is the policewoman trying to catch the killer, but the demands made upon her as an actress are small, and it suffices for her to be Demi Moore. There are other excellent performances, and the whole thing is very well done indeed, or as you might say, a steak burnt as black as the heart of a psychopathic killer can be. Is it edifying? Should we go on glorifying serial killers and making them accessible and amusing? Will filmmakers ever stop polluting the waters of life in this way? No, they won't, because they are as vain as the actors who accept these roles, all being able to show off how clever they are, a kind of 'Look at me, Ma, I can kill with no hands!' Every time a film like this is made, the value of human life declines. Every film about serial killers is another drop in the endless drip drip drip of social and cultural decadence and decline. And as for morality: 'What is that?'",Mr. Brooks
57,jtindahouse,Excellent performances bring out an already terrific script,8,20 July 2021,"I hadn't looked at the cast list before watching 'Mr Brooks' so when a character called Mr. Smith came on screen I found myself asking ""Is that... is that Dane Cook?"" I certainly did not expect him to be in a movie like this, although I do recall him doing a few serious movies in the late 2000s. He was surprisingly good in the role. The whole cast was great though it has to be said. The acting is a large part of what makes this film work so well.They are dealing with a very fine script though it has to be said. I read that Kevin Costner thought this was one of the most perfect scripts he'd ever read, and while it is a little flawed in places (what was that corridor shootout about?) the overall arc of it is terrific. You do need some suspension of belief at times, but you're happy to have that because everything is so entertaining.These are two hours that will go by very quickly for you. The pacing is immaculate. It's a smart movie with great dialogue and class from start to finish. Highly recommended. 8/10.",Mr. Brooks
58,Chris Knipp,Killers Anonymous--Part 2,7,4 July 2007,"While Ben Kingsley attends AA meetings so he can go on killing in John Dahl's 'You Kill Me,' in Bruce A. Evans' 'Mr. Brooks' Kevin Costner goes to them in an effort to stop: he sees it as an addiction. And since he's a serial killer and not a professional hit man, perhaps for him that's what it is. Apparently genteel killers at the level of Mr. Brooks don't need to be locked up, though; they just need to be sent off to 12-step meetings. Brooks doesn't admit to the meeting that he kills people (as Frank does to his): he just says he's an ""addict."" Costner isn't slumming in this movie: he's gentrifying a normally grizzly role. He's a serial killer who's a thoroughly respectable citizen, Portland's Man of the Year no less, and a successful industrialist. And though he kills out of compulsion, he prides himself on the fineness of his technique. It almost looks as if he just has a very dangerous and morally dubious hobbya kind of extreme sport for some genre-bending reality show. Understandably however, he spends most of his time out of the office. Things get pretty complicated for him.For one thing, he has William Hurt riding around in his Volvo with him as a smart and suavely gleeful alter ego named Marshall who's there to tease him and egg him on to more killingagainst his better judgment, of course. And not only is Mr. Brooks rich, but he's being sought (as ""the thumbprint killer,"" though she doesn't know yet who that is) by an unusually lovely police detective, Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore), who just happens to be very rich herself.At first the complications of Mr. Brooks are entertaining. Moore is involved in an unfriendly divorce, and her ex, a handsome philanderer, wants $5 million from her in settlement though he lived off her when they were married. She says in a meeting with lawyers that she'd like him dead. Okay. But then a young neighbor whom he calls Smith (Dan Cook) sees Costner commit a dual murder, his first return to action after two years of kill-sobriety, and Smith's so fired up by the excitement of watching it he wants to go along as an accomplice the next time, and he has incriminating photos to make Costner indulge him. Next Costner's primly named daughter Emma (Danielle Panabaker) drops out of Stanford and when she comes home it emerges that she, like the son of an alcoholic, has the killer gene. She may have done someone in at school; who'll she off next? Isn't this a bit too much? But still there's moreor rather, Demi. She's not only pondering the new thumbprint killing, but also pursuing, and pursued by, a recently escaped murderer, ""the hanging killer"" (Matt Schulze), who's sworn to get her for putting him away. This guy isn't suave, he's ultra violent, one of those hop-heads on steroids.At this point it begins to seem Costner needs Hurt to talk to just so they can keep each other sane. They do appear calmer and more rational than anybody else in the movie.Even though 'Mr. Brooks'' writers got carried away, Costner and Hurt make such beautiful music together in their smart and savvy conversations, sometimes punctuated by a sly laugh, you're conned into feeling the proceedings are making sense. And while they keep up the IQ level, Demi Moore keeps up the aesthetic one. Ms. Moore, as noted, remains beautiful to look at. She ageshardly at alllike a fine Chinese vase, or like a leading lady of French cinema. Not a very fragile vase, though: she can also drop a burly man at five paces. (I remember her turning cartwheels on the Letterman show when she was heavily pregnant.) Perhaps 'Mr. Brooks works harder than it needs to keep you watching. In the movies you can't just kill people: there has to be a gimmick, and in 'Mr. Brooks' there are a few too many. But it's still an elegant thing with nice music, a glossy look. Costner has made a commendably edgy choice in this role, even though it doesn't require him to get his hands dirtyjust a little bloody. The film's Metacritic rating? Only 45, because most critics had to say it's preposterous. And they were right. But it's just as much fun to watch as 'You Kill Me,' and scarier. {For Killer Anonymous: Part 1 see my Comment on 'You Kill Me.')",Mr. Brooks
59,elshikh4,Not as Smart as Mr. Brooks !,6,16 July 2011,"Let's see its good points first: The character of (Marshall) as the lead's invisible mania. It was unfamiliar catchy move to abstract it as an accompanying ghost, dealing with it as the lead's debating mind, and best friend. That mirrored beautifully the lead's marks; as sophisticated, sedate, neat and self-obsessed. Well, craziness wasn't that sane before.Then, Mr. Brooks himself. He's like a genius version of Dr. (Hannibal Lecter), and you know who (Lecter) was. He kills because he's addicted to it, while - in the same time - he prays to god, wishing to go to heaven. Actually, killing for a reason or case sounds less lunatic than this, and his prayers embody even more disorder and conflict. It's where Dr. (Jekyll) and (Mr. Hyde) are mixed, rather united, as if civilization and bestiality are living hand in hand. And finally his ego was too big for one person, so it was split in 2 (Marshal and Brooks).(William Hurt)'s performance steals the show. He was the one I was waiting for to appear. He nailed his character, turning something so nasty into magic. No word he said I didn't become content with. In brief, Thank god for (Hurt). (Demi Moore)'s performance was intense and sincere despite the usual role. She was balanced and professional more than (Kevin Costner), no arguments.The script's first and second acts were the best. We had unique and surprising storylines, breathless pace, and cool dialogue. And it has unmistakable black sense of humor: the exemplary successful businessman is a never-caught serial killer. His daughter has a lust for killing and taking over the business (as if the 2 assignments are one). The movie kills a braggart, of their sexual intercourses, lovers, an annoying gold-digger ex-husband, and a bloodsucking lawyer. And the wife who completely trusts her husband is an absolute idiot!Now, let's see the bad points: The directing got nothing to be proud of. It makes the lousiest TV work better. While this deals with thrill and psychology, it has so little to express. It missed any hot or deep moments. I loved just the emotional moment of discovering the truth about the daughter, and the action of kidnapping (Moore). The editing wasn't less bad. It lacks the term ""Sharp"" utterly. Sure it needed more heat in many places, rather all the places!Used as a realism factor or not, I thought that the nudity disgraced the movie which didn't need such entreaty. It gave preponderance to the movie's commercial side, cheap commercial side for that matter!(Kevin Costner), as the title character, was the weakest actor and the lowest point around. He immersed in a bottomless icy ocean, ranging between someone who reads his lines so indifferently and an impersonator of (Jack Nicholson) occasionally. For the ultimate power and confidence of his character, he sounded confused or empty. And if he intended to play it in low tone; then I didn't hear anything! I though that movie could have been (Costner: The Return), so how he got the nerve to mess with an opportunity like this? Opportunity of working in a thriller that he desperately needed and apparently doesn't come off a lot lately. Is it vanity?, or is it not working much since years and years? I began to think that he's not a good actor in the first place. Nice death scene though.The third act is a letdown. The storylines meet badly. I asked myself what was the need for the second killer who wanted to retaliate upon (Moore)?, or framing her as the killer of her ex-husband? I still also don't know what was the brilliant idea which occurred to the lead while seeing that second killer? And eventually we didn't get to know the truth about the daughter; it could have been great line if it was used, as a breed of rich cool killers.And then a bugging point: While Mr. Brooks is supposed to be the smartest man on the planet, and - yes - the perpetrator of the perfect murder, or the perfect murders for that matter, how come that he speaks to himself loudly, in front of others, all the time?? If not, then this movie failed to transform the feeling of (inner dialogue / shown only for the viewers). With simple tricks, by mostly cuttings, it could have been played as something inside the lead that we - only we - who got to see and hear. However, by the way that was done, he showed as a man with a frank craziness!In conclusion: Although it has so much potential, and bold biting substance, it ends up ruined whether as a high thriller, or psychological movie. Sorrowfully, the bad points made the movie wrinkle to averagely-made entertaining nonsense!",Mr. Brooks
60,billcr12,Good film ruined by Demi.Moore,6,23 May 2012,"Kevin Costner is Earl Brooks, a wealthy businessman and all around great guy and pillar of the community. The only problem is that he is also a serial killer who is trying to reform by attending AA meetings. His id, Marshall(William Hurt) persuades him to kill a couple having sex. He doesn't notice the open curtains and later is blackmailed by a Mr. Smith with photographs of the murder scene. Smith asks to tag along for the next killing.Brooks daughter, Jane quits college and announces that she is pregnant. Detectives visit to question her regarding a hatchet murder at the school. Her father believes that she is guilty and travels to the school and commits a copycat slaying to steer the police off track.So far, so good, a top notch crime thriller until Demi Moore shows up as detective Tracy Atwood, who is a modern day Sherlock Holmes. Brooks decides to fake his own death and devises a scheme using the great cop to pull it off. Moore is ridiculous as a millionaire who just loves chasing bad guys as a hobby. Her acting and the script are equally horrendous. The final third of the film is ruined, mostly by Demi Moore's awful performance.",Mr. Brooks
61,BeneCumb,"Catchy thriller, perhaps slightly lengthy",8,9 January 2013,"The plot is solid, witty, with distinguishable twists and turns - and reasoning with alter ego is no filler, but provides an interesting angle to let the viewers know what's going on and why does the leading character act or think precisely as he does. Nevertheless, everything runs smoothly and activities are logically motivated - without the need for superhero or paranormal helpers. And the ending has multiple interesting layers, not becoming predictable.And the cast is strong and solid, with 2 Academy Award winners: Kevin Costner and William Hurt who are really thrilling to follow; in addition, Demi Moore and Dane Cook give also pleasant performances. This movie should definitely get more attention it has so far; perhaps the title Mr. Brooks is not so successful - I mean that it does not arouse interest.",Mr. Brooks
62,dfranzen70,"Costner surprisingly effective, though movie drags",6,2 June 2007,"At first, when you hear of Kevin Costner playing a serial killer, you think it's a bit of a stretch, since he's not known for being, well, any good. But then it hits you: cold, calculating, emotionless.. why, this is what Costner does best! All is saved.Costner is Earl Brooks, respected community leader, businessman, father, husband, and he's also the notorious Thumbprint Killer, so called because of his penchant for making his victims leave a thumbprint posthumously. He does this because he's addicted to killing - yes, the movie almost tries to make Brooks into a victim. I guess it's the writers' way of making him seem human, not some random killing machine, but whatever. I can almost buy it. Brooks kinda, sorta doesn't wanna kill people any more, but his alter ego Marshall (William Hurt) knows otherwise.A few things complicate Brooks' addiction. His last killing was witnessed and photographed by a man (Dane Cook) who wants to tag along for the next slaying. Plus, Brooks' daughter is dropping out of college. And an intrepid detective (Demi Moore) is hot on his trail. And all the while, he has Marshall in his ear, egging him on, acting as some kind of diabolical Jiminy Cricket.Judging from the trailer and various synopses, I thought this would be a cat-and-mouse game between Brooks and the detective. But it's not, not really; Moore's character, Atwood, spends some of her time tracking the Thumbprint Killer, some of her time dealing with her divorce proceedings, some of her time being stalked by a recent prison escapee. It's almost as if she's in a different film, one in which she's the lead character. Oddly enough, Atwood and Brooks don't even have a scene together.Through it all, Costner's pretty effective. Like I said, this role's really right up his alley. He doesn't have to be Angry Kevin or Happy Kevin, because his character is supposed to be emotionless - even his ""normal"" character, the businessman of the year, because, well, he's a businessman, and all he thinks about are numbers. So, true to the character, right? Sure. A lot of people have criticized Costner for his acting ability, and there's surely good reason for that, but I think he's fine as long as he stays within those quiet, unassuming roles. That's why Dances with Wolves was good - he was a man of few words. And Open Range, and Bull Durham. Those were within ol' Kevin's purview.Demi Moore spends much of the movie trying to look earnest. I had a little more trouble accepting her as a dedicated, decorated cop. Of course, we don't know much about her character aside from an semi-important plot point revealed late in the movie, but her role was one that required a range of emotions. Atwood isn't a killing machine, she's a thinker! She thinks and catches evildoers! But what's she thinking about? What's her motivation? Tell you who I did like for sure, though, William Hurt. Marshall's not unhinged here, and he's not totally in command of Mr. Brooks. He and Brooks discuss things, and sometimes one makes more sense than the other, but Marshall is just reined in enough to make him seem like a normal, albeit imaginary, person.Overall, it's not a bad movie, just a little long and lacking enough twists to make it an effective thriller, which I guess is what it was aiming for. Apparently Costner has said this is intended to be the first in a trilogy, but I'm having trouble seeing it.",Mr. Brooks
63,dee.reid,"""Mr. Brooks"" - Kevin Costner's got a killer instinct",9,23 October 2007,"Mr. Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner) seems to have everything going for him. He is something like the target member of the audience for middle-aged American family men with a beautiful wife (Marg Helgenberger) and beautiful college-bound daughter (Danielle Panabaker) who runs his own successful business (a box factory), has a house fit for MTV's ""Cribs"" (or something less vulgar, like ""If These Walls Could Talk""), and has a lot of interesting hobbies.Watching this movie, should you care, you'll find that one of these hobbies includes making ceramic pots, but that's TOO boring. No, one of these other hobbies is killing people, shooting them in the head, posing the bodies provocatively, and then taking Polaroids. As the so-called ""Thumbprint Killer"" of bay-area Oregon, he's been driving the local cops mad for years. He's cold, he's brutal, in control, and he's efficient - always careful to never leave any evidence behind.Brooks is goaded into these occasional bouts of mayhem and murder by his smooth-talking bad alter-ego Marshall (William Hurt), who's the voice in the back of Brooks's head, telling him that after two years of zero activity and recently being named chamber of commerce man of the year, he's earned a little ""treat,"" something to satisfy that curdling blood-lust (these scenes are indeed interesting to watch, are sickly funny, and require a reasonable amount of suspension of disbelief to handle, so you're not shaking your head like, ""uh-huh,"" too much).I've already revealed enough of the plot of ""Mr. Brooks"" (for now) but this is a magnificent, brilliantly written and acted, occasionally flawed, alternative thriller in an age where Hollywood has (shamefully) become used to the likes of ""Hostel"" and ""Saw,"" where very often gore makes up for lack of imagination. Now I'm almost ashamed to say that I really dig the ""Saw"" movies, but even a gore-hound like me could stand to use a little reprieve even from the likes of the latest Lionsgate gore-fest.Instead, while ""Mr. Brooks"" has brutal violence, depravity and moral repugnance on its mind, the intention isn't to really shock the audience (maybe a little presumptuous, but you get the point), but to examine the dynamics of Brooks's twisted mind, to see what makes him tick, and to find out if there is a cure for his ""addiction."" In fact, he loathes himself so much for his ""addiction"" of shooting people in the head that he attends AA meetings. But as most addicts know, there are those occasional relapses.When Brooks offs a couple who got their rocks by making love with the curtains open, it's almost cathartic, something that the film pays attention to with almost FETISHISTIC DETAIL. Everything goes according to plan but wait - Brooks forgets to check the curtains. Up until now, he's never made a mistake.And who to show up at the box factory the next day than the pesky, scurvy photographer Mr. Smith (comedian Dane Cook, eschewing any trace evidence of a stand-up routine) who reveals to Mr. Brooks that he has pictures of him checking the curtains. Rather than risk exposing him and turning him over to the cops, Mr. Smith insists on tagging along on his next outing, looking to satisfy his own blood-lust. Against his better judgment (and Marshall's), Mr. Brooks initiates Mr. Smith into a crash course on Serial Killing 101 and dares to show him all the ropes of being an efficient psycho killer.Another wrinkle in the plot comes in the form of exasperated rich-woman cop Tracey Atwood (Demi Moore), who's currently worth every penny of $60 million that her adulterous ex-husband is trying to milk out of her smack-dab in the middle of their messy divorce and eventually catches on to the Thumbprint Killer's deadly web of mayhem. But wait, there's more - a lot more - in this thriller that should really be saved for when you finally sit down to watch the movie.While the movie suffers from flaws, mostly in the script department (co-written by the dynamic duo of Raynold Gideon and director Bruce A. Evans), the intense performances of old-school pros like Costner, Hurt, and Moore make up for it. It is true that there do seem to be too many wrinkly subplots that more or less get tied up in the end and tend to take away from the presence of the main characters. The change-of-characters for the likes of Costner and Hurt, who are both usually reserved for nice-guy roles, and un-blooded newbie funny-man Cook now as a pesky hanger-on, are effective and unexpected, and what make ""Mr. Brooks"" an efficient and unpleasant psychological thriller. Yes, ""Mr. Brooks"" is an unpleasant film, but not so much that it's not unwatchable.You can bet that ""Mr. Brooks"" ends unpleasantly, but it's a thriller that you look at and like, and not hate yourself in the morning for doing so.9/10",Mr. Brooks
64,drqshadow-reviews,"Odd Casting Choices and a Narrow, Under-Explored Plot Hamper an Interesting Concept",4,25 February 2013,"Kevin Costner plays an upstanding member of the community, avid potter and caring father who happens to moonlight as a schizophrenic serial killer. Costner is fine in the role but Demi Moore, who surfaces as the tomboy detective on his trail, is badly miscast. She's presented as a grizzled veteran of the force with several shades of action hero, but when we see the character in action it's an awkward, stiff, uncomfortable exercise. Dane Cook is bafflingly tossed into the mix, too, as a wannabe killer who blackmails his way into private lessons with the master. The curious decision to take a serious role does him no favors. There's some promise to the concept, but the script simply doesn't trust its viewers to work things out for themselves and delights in presenting, then abandoning, boatloads of trivial plot threads. Clearly written with a franchise in mind, it saves too much meat for later installments, which leaves this first chapter feeling thin and watered-down. Hammy, forced and predictable, with a fistful of groan-worthy clichés, it's akin to a bad season of Dexter.",Mr. Brooks
65,mattkratz,interesting combination of stories,8,6 November 2017,"The main focus of this movie was on Kevin Costner's performance as Mr. Earl Brooks, a successful businessman who has just won Man of the Year and has a loving family and he also harbors a dark secret-he's a serial killer known as The Thumbprint killer. He ordinarily wouldn't do it but he's addicted to it. He tries to swear it off but gets blackmailed into it by ""Mr. Smith,"" who happened to photograph him during his latest kill and demands to be taken along for the ride. Meanwhile, investigating officer Demi Moore has a mess of a personal life and is also investigating another serial killer.I enjoyed the intelligent script and performances. There was plenty of suspense and good supporting cast. You will like this one.*** out of ****",Mr. Brooks
66,Lechuguilla,The Ultimate Addiction,5,11 August 2013,"Kevin Costner plays Earl Brooks, a successful businessman in Portland. But Earl has a secret; he's addicted to killing people. He also has a secret partner, his alter ego, Marshall (William Hurt), a character who clues viewers in on Earl's present and past motivations and mental states. Being part of Earl's mind, Marshall cannot be seen by other characters; only viewers can see him, as he tags along with Earl everywhere Earl goes. Earl would like to give up his addiction, but Marshall eggs him on to more killings. Naturally, complications ensue.Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore) is the cop who has long been on the trail of Mr. Brooks. With all her personal baggage, including a messy divorce as well as improbable wealth, and as a cop who investigates by means of ""hunches"", Atwood is not remotely believable. And she becomes distracting every time the plot moves her front and center.She isn't the only distraction. The first half is fairly good, with its focus generally on Mr. Brooks. But into the second half, unnecessary characters and revved-up action take the focus off Mr. Brooks, and that reduces suspense. The script contains lots of plot contrivances and too many complications. And businessman Brooks does almost no business. All of which renders the story not very credible.The film's false ending is nauseating. But the ending of the relationship between Mr. Brooks and another character is rather clever, if somewhat bloody.Cinematography and editing are competent. Casting is okay. Acting is acceptable, if not spectacular.I suppose the underlying theme here is addiction, in this case the ultimate addiction. The script is the main problem with its overly complex plot and assorted contrivances, an inclusion of too many secondary characters, and a plot that won't stay focused on Mr. Brooks. But the film is still worth a one-time watch, if for no other reason than to marvel at Earl's perversely amusing alter ego.",Mr. Brooks
67,smatysia,Costner/Hurt interplay the best part,7,5 February 2009,"This film must not have made much of a splash in its theatrical release, as I had never heard of it. Costner does what he always does, playing a dramatic role extremely low-key. William Hurt looked like he was having a blast as the evil alter ego. He was pure evil without being menacing, and the interplay between the two characters/actors is the best part of the film. Marg Helgenberger played a non-entity. And Demi Moore was a bit disappointing. She didn't just mail it in or anything, but there was something missing, something not very believable about her role. And I generally like her work, a lot. I certainly think that this is worth checking out.",Mr. Brooks
68,juneebuggy,Better than expected,8,7 August 2015,"I enjoyed this more than I expected to actually. Its well made, intriguing and I liked the story, a kind of 'Dexter' spin on a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde theme. Probably too many twists and subplots as things moved along but I wasn't ever sure how this was going to play out so I enjoyed that aspect.Kevin Costner is ""Mr. Brooks"", a successful business and family man who also just happens to be a serial killer. He's trying to stop, to go clean with the help of AA meetings but that little voice is back, yes ""Marshall"" has returned, and now even with meticulous planning someone has photographed him at the scene of his latest murder, or maybe this time Mr. Brooks just wants to get caught?Kevin Costner was very good in this as was William Hurt as his alter ego. The scene where 'Marshall' first appears in the back seat of the car made me jump, freaky but all of their interactions were excellent, joking and laughing in a psycho kinda way and arguing with Marshall telling 'Earl' you know you want too.Dane Cook was fine, perfect for his role. I sure didn't predict his angle of the story. I was surprised to see Demi Moore again, (where did her super scratchy voice go?) Her part was probably the least interesting, just a stereotypical cop sub-story with an intense action scene thrown in out of nowhere.We also get appearances from that cute boy toy from Sex & The City (Jason Lewis) and Marg Helgenberger of CSI fame plays the oblivious Mrs. Brooks. I could have done without the surprise ending sequence or at least make that the real ending as it was it felt like it was just thrown in for shock value. 7/20/15",Mr. Brooks
69,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Kevin Costner at his best. A supreme thriller.,9,12 May 2016,"There are a few films Kevin Costner has done in which he has really been allowed and been willing to test the boundaries of what is usually expected from him in a role. 3,000 Miles To Graceland and Eastwood's A Perfect World are fine examples. Perhaps the finest though is Mr. Brooks, a dark tale that showcases the actor in a terrifying turn and the last type of role you would picture for him on paper. Opposites are paramount in acting and cinema as a whole, and it's that type of contrarian casting choice that can lead to a performer's finest hours. In this case it's certainly one of Kevin's best outings, and casts him in a frightening new light, or should I say dark. Here he is Earl Brooks, husband, father, businessman and all round stand up guy. Except for the fact that he moonlights as a methodical and psychopathic serial killer. He sees it as an affliction, and is almost ashamed of it, whether by a tiny flicker of a soul he may have, or simply by the standards impressed onto society. He's efficient, cold and hopelessly addicted to the act of murder. His alter ego, or 'dark passenger' as the scholars say, is a cynical persona called Marshall, brought to life by a scary William Hurt. ""Why do you fight it, Earl?"" he drawls in that committed, laconic snarl that only Hurt can do. There's shades of his character from Cronenberg's A History Of Violence here, affirming my belief that Hurt is a pure acting prodigy and masterful of both the light and the dark within his craft. Earl has a daughter too (Danielle Panabaker) who he has worrisome thoughts about, and a picture perfect wife (Marg Helgenberger). One can't keep the turbulent nightlife of the serial killer a secret for one's entire life though, and pretty soon people start to catch on. A nosy Nelly (Dane Cook) catches a whiff of Earl's crimes and lives to wish he hadn't, and a keen Detective (Demi Moore) begins to piece the puzzle together as well. Earl is as clever as he is murderous though, covering his work and tying off loose ends with gut churning gusto. Costner carries the film terrifically, a man who is at once both uncomfortable in his own skin yet fits it like a glove when the camera dutifully bears witness to his killings. He's like a tiger who really can't change his stripes but wants to shield them from the judgment of others, and of course his own persecution. The scenes of murder are skin crawling in their frank, fly-on-the-wall nature, no slasher cinematics or gimmicky set ups here, just the icy horror of a predator extinguishing human life to sate the beast, and the nightmarish inevitability of death. Those scenes paint Earl in a horrific light, but the film doesn't try to convince us he's a monster using any usual methods, it just presents to us this man, his acts and his life surrounding them, without discernible condoning or condemning. It's cold, it's clinical and it's one of the best serial killer flicks out there.",Mr. Brooks
70,davispittman,I've seen better......,4,19 January 2016,"Even though Mr. Brooks (2007) has a big list of A-list actors, it still manages to be pretty mediocre and been there done that. Demi Moore was the best part of Mr brooks in my personal opinion, she was very spot on and believable as a hard hitting detective trying her absolute hardest to track down Kevin Costner's evil serial killer character. You really do root hard for Demi Moore in this film, or at least I did. Kevin Costner did a pretty good job as the lead, who leads a secret double life as a serial killer who kills innocent people at night behind his family and friends' back. Also I would like to applaud Danielle Panabaker in this movie, she actually did give a good performance, not quite sure if it redeems her from piranha 3DD, but it was good nonetheless. Now Dane Cook was just kinda alright in this film, he seemed a little bit out of his element, maybe good luck chuck is a more suitable type of film for him. As for the script, it was suitable for the movie, it wasn't amazing by any stretch, but it wasn't horrendous either, so there's that. Overall, Mr. Brooks is basically a run of the mill mystery, detective chasing killer kind of thing, not all that exciting overall, but it might satisfy some, who knows. 4/10 for Mr. Brooks.",Mr. Brooks

Minute that he could be serious , but to my utter amazement he was great in his role, But for me it was Kevin Costner who was just brilliant and stole the whole movie,, i like the fact that the movie isn't geared to all of those special effects, i mean yeah there are some in there, but it's not so over the top. the plot line is pretty interesting in the fact that this ""serial killer"" is the ""man of the year"" and really does not want to kill anymore,, fact is he goes to one of those 12 step programs,, pretty neat i thought,, all in all i just loved this movie , and would recommend this one to anybody..",Mr. Brooks
72,fertilecelluloid,"Intentionally ludicrous, blood-splattered good time at the movies",7,27 June 2007,"I don't have to be a genius to know that director Bruce Evans has a fondness for Michael Mann's ""Manhunter"", the first film to feature Hannibal Lector, because there are lots of cinematic trinkets from Mann's film on loan here. ""Mr. Brooks"" (Kevin Costner) is a successful packaging entrepreneur whose Achilles heal is murder. His conscience, William Hurt, encourages his dark side, so part of the film's fun is watching Costner and Hurt interact. Hurt is never seen or heard by anybody else, but Costner does speak to him in the company of others, suggesting that Evans decided to externalize Costner's inner conflict. The idea works. For a pic starring an A-list actor, this is surprisingly bloody and outrageous. One bizarre plot turn follows another, but because the set-up is so ludicrous, nothing comes across as too inconsistent. Costner is superb as a good guy doing bad things; he excels at roles like this and roles such as the criminal in Eastwood's ""A Perfect World"". ""Mr. Brooks"" is a fun horror pic that ought not be taken too seriously; it's no classic, but it has a bloody exuberance that won me over.",Mr. Brooks
73,dworldeater,"Fantastic, my favorite film from Kevin Costner",10,4 March 2018,"Mr Brooks is a highly excellent psychological thriller starring Kevin Costner. This is easily Kevin Costner's darkest movie, it is also one of his best performances on screen to date. Costner is Earl Brooks, a wealthy and successful businessman that loves his family, but has a dark secret and has a compulsive habit of murdering people. He is meticulous in his methods and very efficient and smart about what he is doing. This is a highly engrossing and rich film with excellent character development and story. Kevin Costner gives an Oscar worthy performance in this very well made and original film. William Hurt is equally impressive as his alter ego and has great chemistry with Costner. Demi Moore and Dane Cook also give good performances. The film has a few plot twists and the right amount of dark humor, as a whole the film is very engrossing and interesting, but flows very well. Anybody struggling with addiction(or former addict) will find this film easily relate able and truthful in the films approach to the subject. In my opinion, Mr. Brooks is very underated and easily the best thriller to come out of Hollywood since Seven.",Mr. Brooks
74,jaybob,An interesting film that could have & should have been better,7,26 October 2007,"The very idea of a serial killer being a well respected business man with a family is intriguing.In the past most film as always had a sub-plot,lately they have not bothered with sub plots.....Mr.Brooks has to many sub-plots, Besides themain plot we have Demi-Moore as a Detective & her failed marriage problems, We also have Mr Brooks daughter & her school problems. In addition we have William Hurt as Mr.Brooks conscience.Kevin Costner plays Mr Brooks, he is a competent actor & does a decent job. It was a pleasure to see Demi Moore back on the screen againOne other cast member is Dane Cook (never saw him before) he is quite good as a neophyte protégé,I will be looking for some other roles of his.The location of the movie is supposedly Portland Oregon & vicinity,. BUT dear friends, the film was made in Shreveport Louisiana/At least it was made in the USA.All in All it is not a bad film,ITJUST could have been better.Ratings *** (out of 4) 83 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)",Mr. Brooks
75,aharmas,The Expert Craftsman,8,15 June 2007,"One would never think of Kevin Costner as a man who could play a lethal killer; yes, he can play someone who kills in self-defense or to survive from even the most convoluted plot line, but here is a man in control, assertive, and ready to eliminate any competition out of the way. In ""Mr. Brooks"", thanks to some ""interesting"" direction, and some capable work by Costner, the portrayal is indeed on the dot.As the film develops, one discovers that Mr. Brooks isn't as flawless a killer as it is expected. He goes about satisfying his psychological need to see others succumb to his compulsion, but that it is also the result of some interesting conflicts with parts of his own psyche. Wiliam Hurt is quite good at interacting with Costner, as that reckless force that overtakes Brooks' rational self.Furthermore, having inner conflicts isn't enough to drive Brooks upset. He has to contend with nascent problems with his own progeny, as it becomes obvious that his daughter might carry the predisposition to solve problems the family way. This become an intriguing storyline that is not explored satisfactorily, and this is the beginning of the difficulties with understanding the crisis in the film. Brooks' story line is indeed enough to carry the film, but he must share it with two other underdeveloped subplots about the detective (Demi Moore), obsessed with solving the crime for personal reasons, and two other killers who are causing about every possible distraction to make one lose concentration.In the end, ""Mr. Brooks"" satisfies because it feels right, it is well acted, and it is also gorgeously photographed, carrying with it more power than most ""ideas"" that pass for movies in Hollywood in this day and age. In the end, the film succeeds mostly because of the hard, cold, and killing take on a character that has been around for ages, but somehow because of a little panache and vulnerability goes a long way.",Mr. Brooks

77,Samiam3,Sufficiently intriguing but not (quite) smart enough,6,12 October 2010,"Mr. Brooks strikes me as a movie in which the makers enjoy toying around with ideas and plot points to make something interesting but with little regard for credibility. The movie is never dull I'll say that much, and though it would be a stretch to call it original, the material feels fresh to me. Even so, something essential is missing. Mr Brooks is too forcefully plotted for its own good (or the viewer's). It mistakes coincidence/contrivance for cleverness, and the end result does not impress, but to a certain degree it entertains.Earl Brooks is one of Portland's most valued businessman and also one of its most dangerous psychos. On the night that he commits his first murder in two years he discovers the next day that someone has photographed him in the act. When the black mailer shows up the next day, he asks to be a part of Brook's murder spree. Mr. Brooks' subconscious comes in the form of William Hurt, going by the name Marshall, who is pretty much everywhere Brooks is, but nobody else sees him. Even when there is a third party present (and this is the neat bit) he/she is unaware that Brooks and Marshall talk to each other. The movie tries to find a balance of exposition between Brooks the killer, and Brooks the human being (husband/father/success story). Also, as a parallel story (although I'm not convinced it works) we have Detective Tracy Atwood investigating the latest murder, and portrayed cluelessly by Demi Moore. Uncertain of whether to play the role strait or with a bit of spin (like Willem Dafoe in Boondock Saints) Moore is just sounds lost.Kevin Costner here is not quite as strong as his previous Open Range, but taking into account that he has not given one good performance between 1990 and 2002, Mr. Brooks is actually worth something. Mr. Brooks is almost a good film. Its feet are on the ground, but its head is not. What we get is a heavy psychological drama, that relies on intensity to justify the use of a shaky plot. I felt it could've been a bit better, but watch it and decide for yourself.",Mr. Brooks
78,Matt_Layden,"Wow, A Costner Movie That Is Good?",7,20 July 2009,"This film has a recipe for disaster. Dane Cook co-starring in a role that does not call for comedy, Kevin Costner in the lead not playing a cowboy/baseball player/fish. The clichéd schizophrenic serial killer and Demi Moore as the cop hot on his tail. I did not expect to enjoy the film as much as I did. Surprise, surprise this film is decent.Mr. Brooks has it all, a loving wife, daughter in college and he just won an award for Man Of The Year. Everything seems to be good in his life, except the fact that he has a deep a dark secret, he loves to kill people. Trying to shake this disturbing side of him away, he is forced to kill more people or be blackmailed by a young photographer who saw his last kill.Is it weird that Dane Cook's best performance is still pretty bad? He isn't anything special here and is really forgettable, but he is bearable. That is something I can't say for his comedic roles. Moore does nothing special either, her character has her own sub-plot that we don't ever really get much info on or really care about. Costner is the shining star here. I really enjoyed him in this role (one of which he says was suppose to be a trilogy, I wonder if there will be more). William Hurt is Marshall, who is the one encouraging Brooks to kill people. Oh yeah, only Brooks can see him too. This makes for interesting scenes in which he flat out speaks to him yet the other person in the car at the time doesn't see it. Of course this is all happening in his head, but it takes some getting use to.Mr. Brooks is a cool and intellectual character who almost gets to the level of Hannibal Lecter. Almost. The lengths he will go in order to protect his daughter are frightening.The film is well written and helmed by a competent director he doesn't get all flashy and knows how to tell the story, which is the most important thing.",Mr. Brooks

He does a last ""job"" and is seen by Mr. Smith (Cook) who wants something other than money to keep him quiet. Oh, oh.This is a complicated movie, rather good, but complicated. We actually see Mr. Brooks' imaginary friend in the guise of Marshall (Hurt) and this is better than finding out about imaginary friends like in Fight Club and The Secret Window. But, Marshall is not really his imaginary friend, but his own conscience. But, all in all, there is just too much going on. Problems with being caught and what to do about it, with the daughter Jane (Panabaker) who is hiding something, an escaped killer going after the Detective Atwood (Moore) who put him away, and Detective Atwood following clues leading her to the escaped killer and to the identity of the Thumb Print Killer. There are several other minor plots going on, but not worth mentioning.I guess what bothered me the most was that we see Costner as Mr. Brooks and we kind of pull for him. He is likable and we don't want him to get caught. There is something wrong about that thinking about a serial killer. See? I wish a movie like this was never made because it will bring out the copycats either in more movies like this or (shudder to think) in real life. I mean, here we pull for Costner as Mr. Brooks and hope that Demi Moore as Detective Atwood fails in both her quests (finding the escaped killer before he gets her and finding the Thumb Print Killer). Maybe it was Moore's stilted acting job that made me feel that way. I didn't like her. Was I supposed to? No, this movie made me pull for Costner as Mr. Brooks.

80,Luigi Di Pilla,An extraordinary entertaining thriller with some flaws,6,14 September 2008,I remarked MR.BROOKS in a movie magazine and I have to admit that I am surprised how entertaining it was. There are some flaws and the story contains perhaps too many plots and turns that slowed down sometimes the dynamic development. Some scenes could have cut no doubt to reduce the too long running time. Anyway as I said before there were some funny dialogs where I laughed a lot. Then Kevin Costner convinced me definitely and it's interesting to see him in this extraordinary role. This thriller recalled me THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE with Al Pacino. If you ask me if MR BROOKS is a must see then I would recommend you to rent it first. 6/10,Mr. Brooks
81,dunmore_ego,Serial-licious.,8,9 February 2009,"Serial killer. Not a sympathetic role, but in MR. BROOKS, Kevin Costner dives into the psychotic title character with a violinist's verve. His killings are orgasmic; his planning, meticulous; his wife and daughter, oblivious. His alter ego, so well-defined it's William Hurt.And that's why we love him so. Writers Bruce A. Evans (also director) and Raymond Gideon make Mr. Brooks (Costner) the Good Guy and his alter-ego the villain. Hurt is Marshall, the bestial, bloodthirsty voice in Mr. Brooks's head, except he's not in his head - both Mr. Brooks and we the audience see Marshall as a separate entity.Denial, thy name is Displacement.MR. BROOKS opens with Mr. Brooks winning one of those Man of the Year Awards that mean nothing, bequeathed by the city of Portland, Oregon. After the ceremony, instead of sealing the night with a Plonk of the Year with his hot wife MILF With No Pores (Marg Helgenberger), Mr. Brooks skulks off, at the urging of Marshall, to murder a young couple.Efficiently - but for one thing. The drapes are left open. And a young photographer across the way (Dane Cook), who has been covertly snapping away at the young couple in Coitus Reversus Cowboyus captures Mr. Brooks in Orgasmus Killus.Next day, the photographer visits Mr. Brooks and - instead of the blackmail we think is coming - asks to be taken along on the next kill! Dane Cook (known for his goofball standup comedy and Idiot Boyfriend roles) seems an unlikely off-kilter headcase, but he does a reasonable job - not exactly inhabiting the role, always one exclamation away from blathering, ""Oh God! I'm in a film with Kevin Costner and William Hurt!"" Speaking of miscast: Demi Moore, as a detective on the trail of Mr. Brooks. Her unnecessary backstory of a rich cop who just loves the job doesn't help her credibility when we consider the most prominent example of this millionaire-funning-as-cop is from TANGO AND CASH.Mr. Brooks attends AA meetings as if to pass off his psychosis like an addiction, admitting at his Meetings, ""I'm an addict,"" but leaving it at that, never ""sharing"" what he is addicted to, or how he is succeeding in subsuming his addiction.The movie plays Mr. Brooks's compulsion almost like a ""disease""; like it can be explained away as snidely as that alcoholics' excuse.Costner also served in Eastwood's magnificent A PERFECT WORLD, which asked the same thematic questions pertaining to crime: Nature or Nurture. PERFECT WORLD came down on the side of ""Nurture"" - his character's anti-social nature in that film was molded by his environment. MR. BROOKS says the opposite - sociopaths are born, not made. We marvel at how Costner now plays the mirror image of his character in PERFECT WORLD, as clinical, controlled, and with as much conviction of his innocence as PERFECT WORLD's molded misanthrope.Add a dash of William Hurt psycho, and it is a guilty-as-first-degree-murder pleasure to see these two giants play off each other.When his daughter (Danielle Panabaker) returns home from college unexpectedly, Mr. Brooks discovers a dirty little secret about her that makes daddy kinda proud, yet annoyed that he has to employ his veteran psycho methodology to clean up the mess she has run away from.The MPAA usually doesn't let killers off the hook, so it is an unexpected pleasure to watch MR. BROOKS unfold to a shocking, yet satisfying ending. Two words: knife, throat.Psycho-licious.",Mr. Brooks

83,KUAlum26,Inside(and outside)of the mind of a killer{{Spoilers??}},8,30 May 2008,"I had burned out on Kevin Costner's career somewhere around 1996(though the exact time might go back to the wan attempt at a feel-good,Baby boomer,anti-war,anti-racism flop ""The War"" from '94),and had pretty much given him up as a primarily one-dimensional,flinty,attractive athlete actor. But then recent turns in ""The Upside of Anger"" and particularly this film has me convinced he may've found a perfect niche. I present to you: the deceptively handsome,middle-aged white guy with deep,deep,DEEP problems.This film had me intrigued from the time it was released last summer,but it was pretty much up-and-gone as the high octane seasonal movie rush came out. I rented this almost impulsively,but my instincts were mostly right. Mostly.Costner shines as EArl Brooks,the be-spectacled respected businessman,husband and father who would be a perfect human specimen were it not for the small matter of being a compulsive murder addict. He shares his addiction--one might correctly say that his addiction is fed on--by MArshall(William Hurt,getting darker and more unconventional as he ages),a gleefully amoral alter ego,fully formed, who serves multiple functions for the man he's known since childhood.Of course,Brooks--who,as it turns out,has been an accomplished murderer for far longer than the movie even cares to depict--has been able to skillfully keep everyone he knows,as well as the cops,in the dark as to his true nature. Of course,this skill is dealt a severe(yet savory)challenge when a twitchy,naive voyeur(Dane Cook,convincing enough to emit the appropriate emotions) approaches him with photos taken of Brooks' most recent indulgence. I've read some reviews or synapses that have called Smith/BAffert(Cook's character)a killer wannabe or aspiring serial killer,but I think of him more as an amoral thrill seeker,searching for newer,more disturbing ways to ""get off"". He holds his knowledge of Brooks' otherwise nearly perfect covert activity as a way to be in on the action,with near-predictable consequences.Fleshing out much of the movie's core story are Marg Helgenberger as Brooks' adoring wife,Danielle Panabaker as Brooks' innocent-looking(accent on ""looking"")daughter and Demi Moore as the razor-sharp police detective who is hot on Brooks' trail.A side story(Actually two) about Moore's Detective Atwood seem to be superfluous up until near the conclusion. They seem to distract and break the otherwise smooth and florid(not to mention disturbing)viewpoint of the title character. Writers Bruce Evans(who also directed the movie)and Raynold Gideon have created a sly,intelligent story that,while not perfect and capable of having its share of potential inconsistencies and/or plot holes,it will disturb(might not want to watch this before bedtime!)and conflict. Costner may stand out,but his interplay with Hurt,Helgenberger,Panabaker and Moore are what make this film more tangible and entertaining. The inside of Brooks' mind may be the engine that runs this vehicle,but the interplay between and among important(and even a few not-so-important)characters are its fuel. While treating homicide as something akin to ""addiction"" is certainly not going to sit well with all audiences,those who like their movies dark,full of personal conflict,ambivalence and rife with threads of black humor with feel pretty satisfied in getting to know Portland,Oregon's ""Man of the Year"".",Mr. Brooks
84,antoniotierno,Good thriller providing a fair amount of thrills,7,22 October 2007,"The story has some (not too many actually) twists and works, despite some contradictions. Hurt and Costner are a sensational team, their performances are outstanding and also make the story ultimately laughable. Their plausibility is pushed to the limit but the plot has also some (low) psychology as well as some high concepts. I might not give it high grades only because Demi Moore/Detective Atwood is quite uninspired and because overall it's not easy to decide whether it's more about a thriller, a comedy or a noir. I'd have expected a different finale, not a happy ending, but not even a nightmare followed by an awakening leaving things unchanged.",Mr. Brooks
85,fwomp,Surprising Actors In Unusual Roles,8,20 May 2008,"Having heard the thriller nature of MR. BROOKS, I had my doubts that someone as feel-goody as Kevin Costner could pull off such a role. I was wrong. Costner his loving, creepy, and pathologic all in the same breath.Mr. Brooks (Costner) has a loving wife, a strong local business, is a respected community leader, and he has an addiction problem. An unusual one: he loves to kill people. We catch up with Mr. Brooks at an awards ceremony where he's being presented an award for citizen of the year. But on the way home, something (someone?) lurks in the back of his mind. This something/someone is named Marshall (William Hurt, INTO THE WILD) and he is part of Mr. Brooks' broken psyche. Not having killed in nearly two years, Marshall wants to be let out to play (reflections of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are easily seen).Mr. Brooks battles Marshall but, in the end, loses to his darker side and begins killing again. But, unfortunately for all concerned, someone witnesses the murder and wants to blackmail him. But not in the way most would think. Mr. Smith (Dane Cook, GOOD LUCK CHUCK) wants Mr. Brooks to teach him how to kill. A strange method of blackmail to be sure, but Mr. Brooks takes this would-be killer under his wing and begins showing him the bloody ropes.Trying to hunt down Mr. Brooks (the police have dubbed him 'The Fingerprint Killer' because he does some interesting things at the crime scene with the victims' fingerprints) is Detective Atwood (Demi Moore, BOBBY). The meticulous nature of Mr. Brooks, though, makes her job exceptionally tough. No stray hairs (Mr. Brooks vacuums the crime scene prior to leaving), no gun shells (he's got a special way making sure the shells stay with him), nothing to show who this killer might be. Atwood, though, also has problems of her own. She's going through a messy divorce while trying to solve The Fingerprint Killer crimes. For Mr. Brooks, her marital discord becomes an avenue of surprising revelations.The story of Mr. Brooks is morbidly fascinating. He's the guy next door. The successful business man. The good-looking success story. A family man. But he's also a damaged dude. This gives the story a nice multi-facetedness that many movies lack. The added tension surrounding his only daughter who may have inherited some of Daddy's traits makes it even more so.I was surprised again and again by the strong performances from previously unknown areas. As noted earlier, Kevin Costner tends to lean toward the cute-and-fuzzy, but here takes on a role that is anything but, and does some exceptionally great work. Dane Cook, best known as a comedian, plays the role of a twisted wannabe killer with an amazing quality. Demi Moore as a roughshod cop who wants to do it her way and be damned the consequences is very believable.The only problem I had with the film is that every time Mr. Brooks gets ready to kill someone, the people he's ready to rub-out are having sex. That seemed very convenient and only an addition to the film to give it more sex-play rather than something realistic.But that's my only complaint.",Mr. Brooks
86,SmileysWorld,Mr. Costner's evil turn makes Mr. Brooks a worthwhile watch,8,6 July 2007,"He has played many a likable character,and when he suddenly wants to play the villain,the formula has to be just right to be believable.In the past and with other actors,there has been success and there has been failure.Kevin Costner's evil turn in this film is to say the least,a resounding success.While the film leans a little heavy on the psychological aspects which is somewhat of a turnoff for me as a movie lover,Costner's portrayal of the complicated villain,with whom you will probably sympathize with more than you hate,and Demi Moore's relentless pursuit of him kept me intrigued throughout,as I am sure it will do the same for you.",Mr. Brooks
87,gregsrants,Too many stories,4,5 June 2007,"It's hard being a city famous entrepreneur/man of the year by day and a  serial killer at night. Just as Mr. Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner), who  during the business hours runs a bustling business that allows him the  luxury of a state of the art office and million dollar home. But by  night, the man is a cold blooded killer that exterminates  indiscriminately for the rush he gets from the kill. Kinda makes you  wonder what your boss is up to once the office lights go out.  This is the premise for the new thriller Mr. Brooks that is one mess of  a movie as multiple story lines are squeezed into a two hour timeframe  as easy as a marshmallow can be squeezed through a keyhole.  Here is what the movie contains. 'Deep Breath'. Mr. Brooks is a serial  killer that is encouraged by his imaginary friend (devil on the  shoulder, if you will), Marshall played by William Hurt. Mr. Brooks  starts killing again for the first time in two years and is  photographed killing a couple by a voyeur photographer who goes by the  name Mr. Smith (Dane Cook). Mr. Smith blackmails Mr. Brooks with the  photos into allowing him to help find, stalk and eventually kill an  unsuspecting person or persons. Meanwhile, Mr. Brooks daughter shows up  after she drops out of college and she may or may not have killed  someone with a hatchet at the campus before fleeing back home. Further  meanwhile, police detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore) is going through  a messy divorce while being stalked by a serial killer she once put in  jail who has now escaped. Further further meanwhile, Atwood is assigned  the case of the two dead persons that brought Mr. Brooks and Mr. Smith  together and hunts them down between her lawyer visits and averted  kidnapping attempt.  Got all that? Well I hope you did, cause I didn't.  Mr. Brooks is put together in such a way that you would swear there  must have been about 10 writers all with good ideas that got to write a  storyline which would be exploited during the run. Instead, the mess  comes from the minds Bruce Evans (who also helmed the film) and Raynold  Gideon who I can only imagine sat across from each other at a table and  tried to figure out how to get everything including the kitchen sink  thrown at its unsuspecting viewers.  And to be honest, it's too bad. Costner is creepy and yet stoic as the  Fingerprint Killer, Mr. Brooks. Costner has always had a devilish side  (see A Perfect World) that is never truly translated onto the screen  and Mr. Brooks is so far removed from his Tin Cup characters that you  actually root for him to get out of all the implausible jams he finds  himself in during the film's reels. Demi Moore does OK in her starring  role which probably looked strong on paper but is convoluted on screen.  I can't recommend Mr. Brooks. I wanted to. I hoped to. But I was just  dizzy by the end of the film. Never before have I walked out of a  theatre at the end of a showing thinking that so many different story  lines would have been fantastic if explored separately instead of  mish-mashed (Think of an ice cream cone that gets overloaded and  eventually tops over with each additional scoop).  Sorry Mr. Brooks. Maybe you and Patrick Bateman can get together for  some business power talking and then some power tool killing in the  evening. Until then, I have to give you a thumbs down and then run out  of the room before you get REALLY mad.",Mr. Brooks
88,jpschapira,Is there something about Mr. Brooks?,6,20 March 2008,"This is not a bad movie with a good idea that just doesn't start flowing; this is a good idea that's well developed but misses in managing every detail. If you're going to deal with something as complex as ""Mr. Brooks'"" main idea, you have to keep it complex all the way through. The film, directed by Bruce A. Evans and written by Raynold Gideon (""Stand by Me"") and Evans, fights between complexity and simplicity during its whole ride. After we meet Mr. Brooks (Kevin Costner) and we see him kill, which involves taking pictures of the people he kills and burning them after standing naked and praying to God, there's no doubt that the story contains heavy issues. ""You're an artist"", says a voice looking at the photographs. This is Marshall, Mr. Brooks alter ego, played by William Hurt with an amount of mischief that's always on the verge of exaggeration but never reaches it. An alter ego heavy issue. To reveal anything else about the plot would be unfair for the viewer, but it would also be unfair not to express my complaints. For example, is it possible that time always stops when someone's talking with their own conscience? The alter ego (let's call him Marshall) is one of the film's highest points, because he moves almost exactly like Mr. Brooks and seems to know everything that's going to happen. However, Marshall's discussions with Mr. Brooks are too many and we miss the experience of watching Mr. Brooks trying to give excuses because he talks to himself. Therefore the film chooses the easy way out and develops this mechanism: the one that automatically stops time whenever Marshall and Mr. Brooks are talking. Another case. Not every character is completely developed, but the screenplay is so faithful to the ones they are that we can predict their actions and make accurate guesses before the movie presents answers to us. In this aspect, I've got to give it to Gideon and Evans, because even when they settle for easy mechanisms, in every little moment full of tension where they could take the easy way out, they don't. But again they disappoint when they have opportunities to create a great spoken scene, and surprisingly they skip it; filling it with close ups and music (pay attention to the 'interrogatory' scene). We've realized they're good with words; why not taking advantage of that? As you may realize, ""Mr. Brooks"" is full of contradictions, and I'm not trying to be a conformist here but that could be a good thing because it would mean following the nature of its main character that is, indeed, a complete contradiction; and in this way Evans would be embracing his best achievement: the faithfulness towards his characters. If that's not enough; even being regular, ""Mr. Brooks"" surpasses recent similar thrillers like ""Derailed"" and it features Kevin Costner's best performance of this decade, after his pitch- perfect work in ""The Upside of Anger"". It's really hard to imagine someone else for the role, it's hard forget the character he creates after the movie is over and he plays it, unlike you may think, as a man with true evil inside; as a man who, on the outside, doesn't seem so normal after all if you take a good look. I didn't find a way to mention them because it would mean revealing plot details, but in the acting department comedian Dane Cook delivers an impressive performance and the young and beautiful Danielle Panabaker continues to show great promise; Demi Moore fiercely takes on her first major role since the sequel of ""Charlie's Angels"" and for true ""CSI"" fans (I'm not one but I know), you have Catherine.",Mr. Brooks
89,RonellSowes,Dark Sordid And Captivating,7,10 March 2021,"Mr Earl Brooks(Costner) is a succeful businessman with a family who also happens to have a secret hobby on the side. Killing. Kevin Costner is mostly known for playing All American nice guys and isn't the first actor who might come to find for such a role. But like most talented actors, he thrives in such a role. He's formidable, believable and also strangely likeable as the murderous Mr Brooks. But as good as Costner's performance is he's overshadowed by William Hurt. Hurt plays Brook's weirdly charming alter-ego, Marshall, the humorous voice in his head that drives him to kill. Because the film physically manifests the other, evil side of Brooks it makes the audience feel that he really isn't the same person doing the murders and that the real culprit is Marshall. Someone who doesn't even exist. And this voice has driven Brooks to kill enough times that his actions have become known as the work of a notorious serial killer known as the Thumbprint Killer. Determined to find this Thumbprint Killer is Tracy Atwood(Moore) a crusty detective with borderline superpowers. A worthy opponent, you could say, for the calculating and clean Brooks.
Killing is the name of the game in this film and there are other murderers involved in the story besides Brooks. Meeks, an escaped serial killer intent on getting even with Atwood for putting him behind bars, Mr Smith a sadistic young man who blackmails Brooks into bringing him along and even Mr Brook's seemingly innocent daughter. As you can probably deduct, the film is dark, sordid and intense. But it's still cleverly constructed and highly intriguing-more so than you might wish to admit.With captivating performances from William Hurt and Kevin Costner and modish style Mr Brooks is an engrossing and heart racing 2 hours.",Mr. Brooks
90,deatman9,Mr Costners best!,7,28 October 2012,"I personally only like Kevin Costner in two movies, this one and the critically hated Waterworld. Some of his movies he seems to be such a bad actor but then this one he is terrific. The story line is intriguing and it really keeps your attention holding you at the edge of your seat the whole way through.This movie is about a very influential man who is sometimes controlled by a homicidal alter-ego. He commits murder for pleasure but when someone catches him in the act the blackmail begins.This movie iis definitely one of my favorite thrillers and it is Kevins Costners best film no doubt.",Mr. Brooks

This story about the two halves of a serial killer's personality talking, laughing, killing, spatting ain't all that. As a matter of fact the two halves and their antics are the only good thing about this movie. The plot is nowhere fast. People make assumptions and have reactions that are neither logical nor dramatic. It's a basic B flat movie that gets a C.",Mr. Brooks
92,davyd-02237,Sick!,2,23 January 2021,"We did NOT watch the entire film. William Hurt plays the chap inside the head of ""Mr Brooks"", his major lines include continuous use of the F Word. Then enter the female police officer who also uses the F Word very frequently, especially is she is describing the actions of her estranged hubby and the female population of the City! In short, expect alot of F F F cropping up at regular intervals.

Judging by the IMDb rating of 7.8 I would have suspected nothing short of a little masterpiece. ""Mr. Brooks"" is far from that.Mostly this feels like watching three episodes of an average crime TV series in a row. This is because there are three or four subplots in the story but no real main plot. Not knowing which aspect of the movie we should concentrate on, we can't really lose ourselves in the story and the whole thing never really gets exciting. Bruce A. Evens unimaginative direction doesn't help matters much The actors are all very good in their roles, but William Hurt's role as Kevin Costner's evil alter ego is totally unnecessary and an embarrassing excuse for the writers not being able to show Mr. Brooks' inner conflicts more skillfully. With the main character flawed like that, ""Mr. Brooks"" doesn't make for a very interesting thriller, let alone trilogy (which some claim it will be extended to). This is Sunday afternoon-material, an average movie on all accounts.",Mr. Brooks
94,Darkside-Reviewer,"""The hunger has returned to Mr Brooks brain""",8,26 June 2019,Mr Brooks is a smart and complex character with so much humanity and yet so little at the same time which is interesting for a movie about a serial killer Kevin Cosners performance as Mr Brooks is commanding and demands your attention to his every action and word spoken in a way most actors only dream of accomplishing in a role.Mr Brooks (Kevin Cosner) is a man haunted by his addiction of killing after 2 years of peace his hunger for death has returned to him his minds personification of his dark side (William Hurt) spurring him on temping him into returning to his old ways Mr Brooks gives into his dark side and kills again but will it be the last time he indulges his darkside or is this a new beginning for his addition.A great supporting cast a story that is both thought provoking and intense well directed and thought out with a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack this movie is worth any movie goers time.,Mr. Brooks
95,timdalton007,An Intriguing Thriller,8,20 March 2009,"If you think that all thrillers that come from Hollywood are predictable I suggest you watch Mr. Brooks. From its leading man to its cast, its script and production values it proves that not every Hollywood thriller is predictable. That said it isn't a perfect film by any means of course but its pluses far outweigh the minuses.Kevin Costner gives one of his finest performances as the title character. In the hands of a lesser actor the role could have been just another serial killer, yet in the hands of Costner it is an multi-layered portrait. Costner as Brooks is just as believable as the family/businessman Brooks as he is as the serial killer who kills not for pleasure but because he is addicted. In fact, Costner manages to actually make Brooks a sympathetic character whose addiction threatens to unravel the life he has created for his family and himself.The supporting cast proves to be just as well. William Hurt is first rate as the physical embodiment of Brooks addiction named Marshall and his scenes with Costner are perhaps the best in the film. Dane Cook gives what is the best performance of his career to date as Mr. Smith who tries to get Mr. Brooks to teach him his secrets. Marg Helgenberger gives a fine performance as the unknowing and unsuspecting wife of Mr. Brooks. Danielle Panabaker proves herself a capable actress in the role of Brooks' daughter Jane who may well be more then she seems. The one member of the supporting cast I had problems with Demi Moore as police detective Atwood though that is more down to the script then to Moore who, while giving a satisfactory performance, does little else but that.if there is anything that lifts Mr. Brooks above other Hollywood thrillers it is the script. Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon have written a script that turns the serial killer thriller genre (if you can in fact call it that) and turns it on its head. From exploring what makes serial killers tick to actually making Mr. Brooks a sympathetic character the script manges to dodge the formula pieces and is all the better for it. The problem with the script is the whole Atwood subplot which thanks to both a divorce and her hunt for another serial killer wastes a considerable amount of screen time and causes the film to feel unfocused at times. Yet outside of the Atwood subplot it is one of the best written thrillers to come out of Hollywood in the last few years.The film also features some strong production values. John Lindley's cinematography is excellent and creates much of the atmosphere that populates the film which can also be said of Jeffrey Beecroft's production design. The score by Ramin Djawadi is, like the script, an amazing original piece of work and a fine score in its own right.Mr. Brooks is amongst the best acted, best written, best constructed and most surprising thrillers to come out of Hollywood in recent memory. That is down primarily to its leading man Kevin Costner who shows that not all serial killers are pale copies of Hannibal Lector. But it is also helped by a fine supporting cast, a fine script and top production values. While it has some problems thanks due to an unnecessary subplot but that doesn't change the fact that this is an intriguing thriller that is a head better then many of the films out there.",Mr. Brooks
96,roedyg,a new genre,7,10 June 2007,"I was dragged reluctantly to this movie. I went to this movie because actors who have done great work in past were in it, Kevin Kostner, William Hurt and Demi Moore. I simply trusted they would not have been involved if it were not an interesting projects.I don't like violence. However, the mental puzzles it posed quickly engaged my interest.It is intellectual like a murder mystery, but not detached or bemused. It is gritty. It is terrifying. It is a bit like a police crime drama. Violence is handled in a way reminiscent of the godfather, rare, but sudden and shocking. I have never seen an movie like it. There is no easy way to classify it.The cat and mouse scenes between dangerous, highly intelligent characters were riveting. Almost never have I seen intelligence portrayed on screen with conviction. The director pulls it off by what he leaves out. He does not hit you over the head with a hammer. You have to guess what happened off-screen, often very important events. He does not let you in on everything in a flat-footed way. The Kostner character just quietly amazes you with his foresight and meticulous planning. You have to gradually pull the pieces together for yourself for the movie to make sense. There is no final triumphant Hercule Poirot scene where all is explained. It is a very adult movie in that sense. All the characters are sympathetic, engaging, interesting, even the serial murderer and his evil alter ego, even his bratty spoiled daughter.The Kostner character is highly sympathetic. He reminds me of the soldier eulogised every night on the news, killed in Iraq or Afghanistan. Friends explain the soldier was a devoted father and husband. He was kind, polite, compassionate. It is just he has the urge to kill and maim what overcomes him from time to time.The movie has a few sudden scenes of shocking eye-closing gore which seem almost out of place, but they are necessary to understand the complexities of Kostner's Jekyl-Hyde character.Co-incidence several times stretches credulity. Yet it is not a movie you scoff at. You wonder if perhaps you did not fully understand.",Mr. Brooks
97,rajdoctor,Mr.Brooks,5,19 September 2007,"I was interested to see this movie because of Kevin Costner.The story is about a rich and famous business person Mr. Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner) who has Marshall (William Hurt) who plays his alter self  to be a serial killer. Detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore) is on the job to track down the killer. Earl finds another partner in his crime Mr.Smith (Dane Cook) who has photographic evidence against Earl. Both together plan another killing. Will Detective Tracy be able to stop the killing and will she be able to catch the killer forms the story. The main plot revolves around Earl but there are 3 sub-plots  one of Mr.Smith, another of Detective Tracy and third of Earl's daughter. For sake of those who would go to see the movie I would not reveal the ending here.The most relevant sub-plot to the story is of Mr.Smith and his association with Earl.The Director Bruce Evans is directing this movie after a gap of 15 years  in those years he was a screenplay writer. He must have really got inspired by this subject for him to jump right back into movie making. But to a large extend he does not succeed. There are sub-plots that are disassociated, but forced to be integral part of the main plot, and that is the problem. At the end of the movie there are so many unresolved threads hanging around that one feels totally dissatisfied. Surely there are usual twists and turns in the story that keep us guessing throughout the movie and the Director Evans seems to be a bit ahead of audiences mind most of the times. But he does not finish the race as we expect it to. May be that was his secret!!! Kevin Coaster is veteran and acts well. The best moments of the film are when he consults and talks with his psychotic alter self William Hurt. Demi Moore overacts most of the time.There is not much to mention of any other technique of the movie  most stuff is usual, what we see now a days in most movies. I was a bit disappointed to find the movie in 35 mm.My rating during the movie started at 6 went up to 6.5 and then 6.75, but plummeted back by the end of the movie to (Stars 5.25 out of 10)",Mr. Brooks

Some demons suggest the extra snack or binge. Other voices in our brains suggest doing drugs or alcohol. Come on, one more drink or toke of a joint! Some get thrills or a rush out of stealing items from a store. Some voices even go as far as suggesting killing others. Mr. Brooks on the surface appears as straight and narrow as any established businessman. Portland, Oregon's MAN OF THE YEAR award winner at a lavish banquet with his Lovely spouse by his side. All picture perfect until we come to the ride home where you see Mr and Mrs. Brooks sitting in their car with a strange bald man in the back seat named Marshall (William Hurt) who suggests to Mr. Brooks that another killing should happen. The wife is oblivious to Marshall's presents. Mrs. Emma Brooks (Marg Helgenberger) cant see or hear him. Brooks suggest that they stop at a local Ice cream cafe for desert as Brooks looks upward into an apartment watching two lover for a potential double murder as the invisible Marshall tempts and taunts the frustrated Brooks. Brooks that evening sneaks out of his home and carries out his homicide. Wears special clothing, Plastic bag over gun with silencer attached, everything done to detail.

Meanwhile our nervous friend is waiting to see Brooks as Mr. Smith give the compliant receptionist a sealed envelope of photos of Brooks by the window where he killed two lovers that faithful night. Brook's is surprised by Smith's unusual request which has nothing to do with shaking Brook's for money.

Atwood's personal life intertwines with this story plus more bad news about daughter Jane as she is in more hot water involved in a homicide. Three stories connect in a two hour thriller. Some might say the coincidences ruin the movie but the editing and quick scenes keep you from falling asleep. Personally I'm not a fan of the acting skills of Costner but I do enjoy his scripts/story lines, i.e. No Way Out, Bull Durham, Field Of Dreams and JFK. Costner was very unpretentious, quite reserved maintains a coolness to this role. Dane Cook plays a frustrated tag along and Demi Moore plays the baffled gum shoe always three steps behind the killer. Demi personally is not a likable character in most of her movies but when it come's to divorce lawyers, I'm rooting for Demi.

100,MovieHoliks,One of Costner's Best!.....,9,18 June 2015,"I saw this in a theater when it first came out, and got out my DVD and watched again the other night. LOVE this movie! Kevin Costner (in one of his best, most complicated & unique performances) stars as a billionaire industrialist, who is lured back into his secret serial killer past. He does so with the help of his inner alter-ego (William Hurt), who constantly advises him on every detail in life. This movie came out in 2007 I believe, and I couldn't help but think of the BTK killer, who was captured only a couple years earlier- like Mr. Brooks, a serial killer who was unbeknownst to his family and friends, plus a pillar of the community- AND comes back after so many years inactive. Of course, the main difference is that Mr. Brooks is of a much higher calibur in terms of his place in society, wealth, means, etc.. And short-lived film star, comedian Dane Cook, also has a deliciously awesome role as a nearby nutcase who blackmails Brooks after catching him in the act! After this film, I honestly thought Cook would go on to great things in the movies, but his career really never took off. I see too this film was originally going to be part of a trilogy, and due to the fact the film wasn't a huge box office success, plans were scrapped-?? Damn! Would love to have seen that trilogy come to fruition!... :( Marg Helgenberger, Danielle Panabaker and Demi Moore also star.",Mr. Brooks

I looked forward to seeing this movie, and 15 minutes into it I was so lost I never recovered. The acting was pretty good, but the story has so many ins and out you could not keep track. I think the performance by Demi Moore was a waste of talent as well as William Hurt playing Mr. Brooks alter ego.

102,majikstl,And his not-so-guilty conscience,8,1 July 2007,"Everybody needs a special friend; someone to talk with and confide in, someone to share their dreams, someone to help with the crossword puzzle. Someone to help aid and abet in committing murders and covering up crimes. Earl Brooks has such a friend; his name is Marshall. Marshall isn't real; he's more like an evil twin or an invisible friend. Marshall isn't so much Earl's conscience as he is Earl's anti-conscience. Marshall gets a lot of bad ideas about how Earl can have some nasty fun, but to his credit, Marshall also works very hard to make sure Earl doesn't get caught.Mr. Brooks is, for the most part, a really nice guy -- a successful businessman, a loving father and husband, and a recovering alcoholic (or so he says). In fact, as MR. BROOKS begins, Earl is receiving an award as ""Man of the Year"" from some sort of civic group and to celebrate he stops for ice cream with is loving wife -- and then later on commits a double homicide. For reasons that aren't clear -- and probably aren't important -- Earl stalks a couple of young lovers, interrupts them while they make love, shoots them in the head and then poses their nude bodies in a sexual position. Then he leaves behind their conspicuously placed bloody thumbprints as his signature. This is his modus operandi, which he has apparently used numerous times, and which has earned him the name ""The Thumbprint Killer."" He is very meticulous in how he commits his crimes, but as we learn, Earl can also improvise if need be.Earl wants to quit his peculiar hobby, despite Marshall's protests. But things get complicated. The police are investigating; and one policewoman in particular is eager to solve the case. Plus, a witness pops up, who proves to be not only a blackmailer, but a peeping tom, a stalker and a wannabe serial killer. And then there is Earl's loving daughter, who wants to take over the family business, in more ways than one. Earl's life is not easy, but if there is one thing Mr. Brooks does well -- besides murder -- it is coping.As cleverly contrived as MR. BROOKS is, it works to a large degree thanks to the efforts of its stars. Kevin Costner is Earl and William Hurt is Marshall. Though Hurt is considered one of our finest actors and Costner is generally dismissed as being limited due to his low-key style and persona, the two have something in common: they both have the knack for being interestingly bland. When placed in heroic, leading man roles, neither is really believable -- as watching LOST IN SPACE or WATERWORLD will attest. Yet, even if they make potentially interesting characters seem dull, both actors have a skill for making ordinary men unusually intriguing. Whether it is Costner as a farmer (FIELD OF DREAMS) or a failing baseball player (BULL DURHAM), or Hurt as a writer (THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST) or a janitor (EYEWITNESS), they are able to make us believe there is more to the character than meets the eye. In MR. BROOKS, they play off each other's innate blandness and create an intriguing other, sort of dueling nerds fighting and feeding off each other to create a believably disturbed third.Not for an instance is Demi Moore believable as the aggressive, hard-nosed policewoman, though comedian Dane Cook is marvelously hyper, always flirting with going too far, as the bloodthirsty blackmailer. Neither character, nor their subplots, are quite credible, but their impulsive, often illogical behavior underscores just how rational Mr. Brooks seems in his quest to deal with is homicidal impulses.Like its title character, MR. BROOKS has a dark sense of humor, played with deadpan seriousness. Neither the character nor the film are quite all there, but they both go about their deadly business with a concerted drive to fool themselves and everybody else into believing that they are above reproach and, in their own way, sincere. And even as you know that Mr. Brooks the man is crazy and MR. BROOKS the movie is a con; you can't help but to buy into them. Their ultimate charm is their unpredictability.",Mr. Brooks

Kevin Costner and Demi Moore seem to have been missing from Hollywood for years now, and then they pop back up with THIS? This is one of the stalest, most unimaginative scripts I have had to sit through in a while. It's like, ""Oh...this is a SERIOUS movie. About murder. With plot twists"". CHEAP plot twists, that don't really make you feel anything. Dane Cook tries hard to be mean and serious, but just looks like a goon doing so. His acting is poor in this. See him in DAN IN REAL LIFE instead. Demi Moore gives it her best but isn't given any decent lines to work with. William Hurt is given the opposite - he was cast as the schizophrenic ""other"" personality of Costner, and basically has to recite the most ridiculous, nonsensical cheeseball ramblings. I feel bad for him. He's just plain annoying in this - and that's coming from me who's favorite movie of all time features him in the lead role (Altered States). And Costner just feels like Costner, reading memorized lines as well. STALE! Boring! Nothing makes this movie standout. The interesting ensemble makes you think want to check it out, but in my opinion it is absolutely not worth it. There is one very cool, surprising scene towards the end - but unfortunately it is not enough to save this stinker!",Mr. Brooks

What you get is ""Mr Brooks"", this season's most pretentious big-budget thriller. Everybody is living in Tyler-Brûlé-style apartments. There's not a single prop that doesn't match the color scheme. Several characters pursue pretentious hobbies just so the set designers can do their thing. Needless to say that none of this covers up the ambitious, yet predictable plot. Nor the sub-zero acting. Kostner's conceit knows no bounds; it even rubs off on William Hurt in the role of his alter ego. Moore is a one-trick pony if I ever saw one. The way she keeps tilting her head for no particular reason is an exact replica of the ""Striptease"" blow-dry scene. The only ray of hope is drop-dead lovely Danielle Panabaker in the role of daddy's bloodthirsty little girl. Keep an eye on this fresh-faced, hazel-eyed, stone-cold hellion.",Mr. Brooks
106,dilbertsuperman,Deliciously Sociopathic and Very Intelligent.,9,26 January 2010,"There's a lot of movies out there that try to be clever clever with their plot twists and it becomes very obvious that the people who wrote those twists must be shooting at a dart board in between doing lines and heavy drinking. This is not that sort of movie. This script is smart, tight and very interesting to see unfold. The plot vehicle of the schizophrenic sociopath being represented as a second actor is very effective, and the plot itself plays out very much like a chess match in high speed. Our character thinks 3 or 4 sometimes 5 moves ahead. I've seen lots of movies try to attempt what this movie achieves... and it's gold.PLOT: The man of the year in an Oregon town has a little bit of a dark secret.. he has an addiction that he can't seem to give up, mainly due to his other personality egging him on.. he likes to... well..that would be telling now wouldn't it? Let's just say that his addiction is deadly, and he wants to stop.. his cry for help is answered, but does he really want to stop? He's not sure. Two side plots keep the action clicking along and the whole movie seems to pass very quickly as a result. This is one of the only movies you are going to see Dane Cook not looking and acting like he is bisexual overdosing on lip gloss and sad attempts to be cute to 13 year old girls.. his character is actually watchable for a change in Dane's usual acting style, what a relief that is. Demi Moore plays a cop and she looks as good as she did in St. Elmo's fire, and that's after kids.. she has one hell of a surgeon and a line on some good botox I guess, but however she does it, she still looks great and her role suits her.If you love this movie as much as I did you will probably also like American Psycho and Clay Pigeons that carry some similar themes.",Mr. Brooks

After their latest killing of an exhibitionist couple, Brooks is contacted by a local peeping tom who has pictures of Brooks at the scene of the crime, but he doesn't want money, he wants to join in and kill too.

108,barrys82,"Mr. Brooks, a very enjoyable thriller",9,19 August 2007,"Very good movie, I didn't expect much before watching it, but after two hours, it really surprises and convinces me, a really good thriller with a lot of suspense and mystery and even some funny moments filled with sarcastic commentaries. With a very interesting , original and convincing plot, the story is great, although at the end I feel that is doesn't have the necessary closures and it begins to be a little predictable. The cast is awesome, Kevin Costner finally in a role that fit him really well after a series of failures in his career, his performance as Earl Brooks a man who seems to have a perfect life and a perfect family but that hides a dark secret, he is and addict to murder, it has been a very long time since I watch him such a perfect acting. Dane Cook is another one that delivers us a flawless performance as the vouyerist that discovers Mr. Brooks his role is funny and at the same time very dramatical. It was so nice to see Demi Moore again on a movie and with a completely different role we usually see her, a strong and confident policewoman with her own problems. But the one that steals the movie with his performance is William Hurt, his role as Mr. Brooks alter-ego Marshall was simply perfect and spectacular. The secondary roles of Marg Helgenberger and Danielle Panabaker give the necessary support to the main actors and for a good developing of the movie. In conclusion, a dark, creepy thriller that will keep u on the edge of your seat for two hours. A must see movie for those persons who likes suspense movies.",Mr. Brooks
109,TheMarwood,A couple of different movies competing in one movie,5,31 May 2014,"There's a very good film buried inside Mr. Brooks. That film is about a serial killer who has an alter ego who materialized for the camera played by William Hurt and Mr. Brook's daughter who secretly seems to have the same murderous impulses that her dad passed onto her. There's also a terrible film happening as well about a cop played by Demi Moore who is dealing with a psychopath from her past, as well as investigating Mr. Brooks' most recent murder. Then the film shoots itself in the foot by adding Dane Cook who brings each scene to a grinding halt, as an extreme jerk who blackmails Mr. Brooks into teaching him how to kill. The film is a mess. When it focuses on the direct story it should be focusing on, it is a fantastic piece of twisted comedy and dark drama and when it strays from that material it meanders and limps from scene to scene. Mr. Brooks is an overstuffed mixed bag, that is a frustrating experience, because what it gets right - it really gets right - but it gets lost amongst the clutter.",Mr. Brooks

However, Mr. Brooks proves his good acting ability.Mr. Brooks is NOT a slasher movie. So anyone who hopes to go to this geared up for blood and guts everywhere, randomly placed jump scenes, killers chasing big-breasted horrible actresses everywhere should avoid this. This is an excellent psychological thriller that does involve a killer.Earl Brooks is the man of the year. He has a wife and a beautiful teenage pregnant daughter. He has a man who constantly follows him around named Marshall, and so at night, Earl is a serial killer. His latest victims are a young couple, who are seen having sex before Earl kills them. The next day, his daughter has told him that she is moving back in, and she has dropped out of school to become a part of his business. The same day, a young man named Mr. Jones reveals the fact to him that he has witnessed Earl's latest killing. However, Mr. Jones isn't going to report him to the police, he wants to join in on the killing.Mr. Brooks is a white-knuckle thriller with fantastic acting by Demi Moore, Kevin Costner, and Dane Cook.

The other 30 is spent on Tracy Atwood (Moore), the detective who's been after Brooks for many years. Her side of the story is no less engaging, but it does deter us from the weirdly enthralling psychopath. Mr. Earl Brooks, played by the incredible Kevin Costner, is addicted to killing. William Hurt's the devil on his shoulder, always in Brook's presence. They come hand in hand, like bread and butter. Costner-Brooks' fully aware of his burden, trying to keep it under wraps, away from his wife and daughter. Hurt-Brooks' is a loose cannon. They kill, they laugh, they share emotions. Costner can be irrational and Hurt headstrong. It's a touch of schizophrenia, but never says so. The veteran actors dance a dark, humorous, tango, one that makes it acceptable to relate to their ups and downs, no matter how good or bad their actions. His daughter (Panabaker), the detective hunting him and the guy who forces himself under his wing (Cook) trouble Brooks in many ways. It proves to be perverse (but acceptable) entertainment.",Mr. Brooks
112,rollernerd,Dark addictions - Dark Impulses,8,29 September 2021,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is psychological thriller Mr. Brooks (2007), where the very likeable Kevin Costner switches up roles and plays Mr. Brooks, who is a business man, a philanthropist, a man of the year (a reward he receives in the beginning of the flick), a husband and a father. But there is also a darker side to him, a cold, methodical and calculated side with not the best intentions if he picks you out from the common crowd. Gotta admit, this movie was not what I expected...and in an awesome way!! What a gem of a flick where Costner plays this character in a different level, I would not have pictured. The story is awesome which I won't give away, all I can say is we have a man who is an addict - in the sense of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde addiction. The compulsions of Mr. Brooks makes him the infamous and mysterious Thumbprint Killer by killing young couples, arranging their bodies in various positions and meticulously cleaning the crime scene while signing it with the victim's fingerprints. That's the story - there's more to it, but I guess you have to watch it. What really got me on the edge was Mr. Brooks alter ego, his companion - the fiendish Marshall played superbly by William Hurt. The two bounces off each other in such perfect arrangement while discussing urges, having banter and analysing particular moments. This imaginary figure who constantly leans over Earl's shoulder while he's driving while devilishly laughing or flashing an evil grin and converses with Mr. Brooks is hands down genius scripting and filmmaking. The chemistry between Costner and Hurt adds value to the movie and both their performances really allows you to root for them, even though they are the primary villains of the movie. Costner effectively displays internal conflicts between the good and the evil side while Hurt is equally haunting who you could say anchors on as a moral compass in order for the dual persona to not get caught. Overall a great flick 8/10.",Mr. Brooks
113,cosmic_quest,"Dark, creepy and ambiguous...",8,24 October 2007,"Kevin Costner definitely proves he has his groove back in 'Mr Brooks' and, if he carries on in this vein, he has every chance of once again recapturing the popularity he enjoyed in the Eighties and early Nineties. This film centres around Earl Brooks, who, on the surface, seems to be a successful businessman, a loving husband and a doting father to his eighteen-year-old daughter Jane. However, Brooks has a secret. He's a sociopath who enjoys the thrill of killing and he shares this 'hobby' with his imaginary friend Marshall. Responsible for a spat of serial murders, Brooks' life is complicated when he not only catches the interest of determined Detective Tracy Atwood but he ends up being blackmailed by a witness, who calls himself 'Mr Smith', who saw him at the scene of a crime.Successfully breaking the mould of previously only taking the role of 'good' characters in films, Kevin Costner is excellent as Brooks depicting the character's methodically callous, intelligent and vicious nature balanced against his protectiveness and genuine love for his family. As a result, Brooks is a rather curious character, one who leaves you unsure whether to love or loathe. William Hurt is equally as proficient as Brooks' imaginary partner Marshall, in portraying the character's malicious glee at the thought of murdering and stubborn goading to encourage Brooks to embrace his dark side. Dane Cook is a surprise in his role as Mr Smith. Usually featuring in comedies, he adapts to the genre of psychological thrillers with ease and handles the character of Smith, a smug and childishly vulgar man who doesn't seem to grasp the fact he is far from running the show, in a manner that leaves you almost sympathetic to him for not having the brains to see the dangers of ever pitting himself against Brooks.In many ways, the tone of this film will be familiar to fans of the TV show 'Dexter or those who have seen 'The Young Poisoner's Handbook', where you have a psychopathic lead character who does engender a sense of empathy and amiability in the audience because they are depicted, in some scenes, in a very human way. You want to like him despite what he is and what he does. 'Mr Brooks' also manages to maintains the suspense from start to end, leaving you never quite sure what is going to happen and if Brooks will 'prevail'.This is definitely a film for those bored of bland, predictable thrillers and are seeking something with more intelligence and who enjoy a sense of ambiguity in their protagonists. Excellent film and I wouldn't be surprised if wen see it making an appearance at the Oscars.",Mr. Brooks
114,tburke85,Mr Brooks A Decent Thriller With Good Performances,7,8 June 2009,"Mr Brooks is a decent psychological thriller with a solid performance by it's lead actor Kevin Costner whose recent films may not have been that great lately but he still proves to be a very talented actor in this one. Director Bruce A Evans does an admirable job of bringing this movie to the big screen. The movie tells the story of an ordinary man named Earl Brooks who tries to keep his double life as an addicted serial killer a secret played effectively by Kevin Costner and his evil imaginary alter ego embodied by William Hurt. The rest of the cast are good in their roles including Demi Moore as a tough detective, Dane Cook as a wannabe serial killer, and Marg Helgenberger as Costner's wife who's unaware of her husbands homicidal tenancies. The pacing of the movie was a little slow at times but the rest of the movie made up for it's few flaws. The brutal deaths were well executed and somewhat realistic but unfortunately there's nothing too memorable about them. Parents should be warned this movie contains strong blood violence, some graphic sexual content, and language so they should see it first before deciding whether their kids are old enough to watch this movie. Overall however Mr Brooks is still a good enough thriller because of the exceptional performances by Kevin Costner and especially William Hurt who make the movie worth watching at least once.",Mr. Brooks
115,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,Brilliant suspense and tension...Mr. Brooks really keeps you thinking,8,31 May 2007,"'Mr. Brooks', 2007's first true psychological thriller, features an all star cast with Kevin Costner, Demi Moore, Dane Cook, and William Hurt. With a thriller like this, and 2 actors (Cook and Costner) who are playing extremely different roles, the film could have failed. It doesn't at all. It is an extremely clever and intelligent film that is a great ride from start to finish.Earl Brooks (Oscar Winner Kevin Costner) is Portland's man of the year. He has it all, a beautiful wife, a wonderful company, an awesome home, and a daughter (Danielle Panabaker) in college. But Mr. Brooks also has a secret. A secret addiction. He loves killing, mostly because of the maniacal representation of his temptations and desires: Marshall (Oscar Winner William Hurt). After one last killing, Mr. Brooks is ready to quit, but is quickly blackmailed back into killing by the young photographer known simply as Mr. Smith (Dane Cook). Smith just wants to tag along for the ride to feel the rush of killing. But this murderous trio of Brooks/Marshall/Smith must be careful, as tough-as-nails detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore) is on their trail.I know my description of the plot is thorough, but it doesn't spoil anything, as all this is introduced within 10 to 15 minutes of the opening. I give director Bruce Evans a lot of credit for moving the film along quickly, because most of it is the self-inflection conversations of Mr. Brooks and Marshall. The acting is very well done, and with a cast like this, you should expect it. Costner has been everyone's hero the past 2 decades, but Costner totally breaks the mold with a daring and riveting performance as the conflicted, murderous, yet loving Mr. Brooks. His performance really allows the audience to root for him, even though he's a vicious killer. Costner effectively displays internal conflicts between the good side of him, and the dark side. William Hurt is equally haunting as Marshall, the figment of Brooks' imagination. No stranger to villainous characters (there is no true villain, but Costner, Cook, and Hurt's characters are all bad men), Hurt will grab the audience's attention with his smooth and liquid delivery and cruel responses to Mr. Brooks's regrets. Demi Moore delivers in a role that is a type of character rarely seen in movies anymore. Moore gives us a very flawed, yet strong woman who is the only truly good and moral character in the entire movie. Her character has a lot going on in her life, and it is definitely conveyed in her impatience and quick temper, but we always know why she is how she is. Lastly, and the biggest surprise of the entire film, Dane Cook steals the show in one of the better performances of recent memory. Cook goes tit for tat with Costner in every scene they share, providing some pretty intense moments between the pair. Being the comedian he is, Cook will get a couple of laughs, but this role is completely serious. Cook looks like he had a lot of fun doing this, as he gives us a very layered Mr. Smith who is very disturbed, but at the same time, we know he's a fragile guy who is just a pawn in Mr. Brooks' master plan. Cook will blow you away with his range, and he does a great job displaying his character arc. Mr. Smith starts off as a sarcastic and overconfident guy who is looking to toy with a killer. By the end of the film, Smith changes radically into a completely different person. Way to go Dane.Bruce Evans does a great job at the helm of the film, providing a fast paced psychological thriller helped out by clever dialog, and one of the most intelligent characters portrayed on film since Hannibal Lecter in Mr. Brooks. It's almost unreal how smart and clever Costner's character is. Another thing I liked was the symmetry between Costner and Hurt. The actors carry a lot of the same mannerisms into their characters, and with the help of Evans, it looks great. There are times where they will do the same movement at the exact same time. Mr. Brooks is a first rate thriller that any fan of the genre should enjoy. The plot has its twists and turns before the grand finale, which reminds the viewer that...Mr. Brooks always has a plan...8/10 --spy",Mr. Brooks

I think they should have left the daughter scene stand alone and ended it there but. The only reason not a solid nine is the female cop, she didn't work at all.

118,GirishGowda,Meet The Batman of Serial Killers!,8,20 May 2010,"Last week I rented out Mr. Brooks as my friend had recommended this. This film treats murder as an addiction, like any other alcohol, drug addictions. That is a very good move by the director Bruce. A. Evans. Mr. Brooks is like the Batman of serial killers. He has a secret closet where identical serial-killer outfits hang above a row of matching black boots, and he has all the latest in serial-killer gadgets. Just because he is addicted to murder doesn't mean he is stupid. He takes all precautions and has full information about the prey he wants to kill.A hardened detective enters into a case with a vicious serial killer she is tracking after earning the respect of the police department for tracking down a murderous madman known as 'The Hangman' in this vicious psychological thriller starring Demi Moore, Kevin Costner, and William Hurt. Earl Brooks (Costner) is a successful businessman, noted philanthropist, and loving father. He's the kind of man that no one would ever suspect of being a notorious serial killer, but then again history's most chilling psychopaths are often the quiet neighbours who no one would ever suspect capable of committing such unspeakable atrocities. Until now, no one has had any reason to link Earl Brooks with the heinous crimes of the dreaded Thumbprint Killer. Even his beautiful wife (Marg Helgenburger) and teenage daughter (Danielle Panabaker) could never conceive of such an awful truth. But when Mr. Brooks's dark side begins to take over his sane exterior, an amateur photographer (Dane Cook) captures the killer succumbing to his murderous instinct on film. Now, as Mr. Brooks is pursued by the detective Tracy Atwood (Moore) and forced to bend to the will of an opportunistic bystander, the killer who was once able to keep his murderous alter ego (Marshall - William Hurt) in check finds his control steadily slipping.This film brings out the best in William Hurt and Kevin Costner. Wish I could say the same about Demi Moore, but she is nothing more than a bystander to the killer's awesome detailed killings. She is always several steps behind Mr. Brooks. The divorce angle isn't quite interesting. Mr. Smith (Dane Cook) is a slimy basterd whom nobody will like and that means he did his job perfectly. William Hurt as Marshall, the murderous alter-ego of Mr. Brooks brings out Brooks dark side to the fore. They are both intelligent psychopaths who love Brooks's family. Kevin Costner makes us root for the psychopath in him by giving a memorable performance as Brooks who is addicted to killing. Danielle Panabaker is also very good as the sweet and cute daughter, Jane Brooks who also has an addiction to murder. The cinematography and background score is very well done. This is an above average thriller which will capture your attention till the end. See it, you won't be disappointed.8/10",Mr. Brooks
119,seawalker,Gloriously daft and entertaining psycho thriller,8,16 October 2007,"Kevin Costner is Mr. Brooks. Successful businessman, pillar of the community, loving husband and father. Mr. Brooks is also an extremely competent, clinical and careful serial killer; that is when he can no longer resist the urge to indulge in his 'addiction'. ""Mr. Brooks"" is about the consequences when Mr. Brooks makes a silly mistake when out enjoying an evening's 'entertainment'.I think that it is safe to assume that the glory days of the 1980's and 1990's in which Kevin Costner and Demi Moore occupied to rarefied air of the A-Lister is now far behind them. (William Hurt has always been a fine character actor, but even after winning the Oscar he was never an A-Lister, and probably never will be.) However, if the reduction in their star status means that Mr. Costner and Ms. Moore can now spend their time appearing in gloriously daft and entertaining psycho thrillers like ""Mr. Brooks"", then may they languish in their current B- pecking order forever.Even in his lightest films Kevin Costner always struck me as being just a little bit too dour and just a little bit too serious. Here he is truly seems to be having the time of his life, striking up a wonderful double act with a droll William Hurt, who plays Mr. Brooks' whispering, cajoling and teasing psychosis. Good performances by the pair of them, and also by Demi Moore as the cop trying to catch them amidst her own personal problems.It is not going to win any Oscars, but I really enjoyed ""Mr. Brooks"". It is exactly the kind of movie that used to go straight to video, but now turns up on Movies 24.

One, because I enjoy intelligent thrillers and two, that Kevin Costner of all people was playing the bad guy. I've just finished watching Mr. Brooks and I must say that I really enjoyed it. Kevin Costner is the very definition of hit-or-miss as far as actors go, but he really came through here; he was PERFECT as Mr. Brooks. His very demeanor put him over the top here as far as nailing the character. Demi Moore, who I am not a fan of, was decent here as well; her sub-plot was enjoyable and I liked how it all tied together to the main plot. Dane Cook, although a lot of other IMDBers enjoyed his performance, I for one did not. He was way too annoying for my taste; let's just say that I was VERY relieved at how his character turned out.

However the script could still be way better in my opinion.The movie actually starts showing several social-family problems, which could have developed into some touching plots with emotional people involved, however the later half of the movie failed to do so, just left me a little unsatisfied.Actually as a horror movie, Mr. Brooks is very violent and bloody(and with nudity). It doesn't fall short of any elements a horror movie should contain. Kevin Costner is the core character of the movie and he is surprisingly comfortable with his role, which is creepy but handsome, intelligent but crazy, realistically evil but a caring father. Despite the movie is not Oscar-type, he deserves a nomination definitely. It's fun to see the difference showed between Mr. Brooks and Mr.Smith, who is amateur wanna-be killer, a real yap that people like to hate. The audiences will find themselves developed some personal emotion with Mr. brooks, while he interacts with Smith. That is quite smart.In addition, William Hurt's terrific as Kevin's alter ego.

Mr. Brooks has abstained from killing for a few years when all of the sudden the itch starts to scratch and with a little needling from Marshall he is at it again. He commits a double murder and is captured committing the act by a voyeur, Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith bribes Mr. Brooks into allowing him to join in the experience of killing a person. While this is happening Mr. Brooks' daughter Jane commits a heinous act at college which reveals she has the killing gene. Detectives show up to question Jane and Mr. Brooks chooses to save his daughter by committing an identical crime thus exonerating her. There is a Detective Atwood, who is going through a divorce, on the case of the double murder and Mr. Brooks decides that Atwood's ex-husband and his attorney would be a good chance to break Mr. Smith in. This is all part of Mr. Brooks' ingenious plan along with the approval of Marshall who is always nearby and up for giving advice. The crime is committed and when they are leaving the scene Mr. Smith pulls a gun on Mr. Brooks. Mr. Brooks seems okay with this as he explains he wants to commit suicide and end the murderous cycle. The plot is clever, witty, violent, psychological, brutal, duplicitous, and has an ambiguous ending. All in all it's a fairly well rounded, significant and entertaining film in it's genre.",Mr. Brooks
124,arthurclay,Not what's expected,10,22 November 2007,"And I mean that in a good way. I had a feeling that this was going to be another Silence of the Lambs or something of that nature. Wrong. It was much better. I will not give any major plot details up here. I will say it's very worth watching. Costner's acting career was seeming to ""dwindle"" in a sense but this in my mind was a comeback. Quite a comeback. And whoever decided to put William Hurt next to him should get a salary bonus. These two guys gelled excellently. I as a rule do not enjoy serial killer films this was a notch above anything i've seen recently of that genre. Costner's character was both remarkable and remarkably devious. What a combination. Costner made a wise decision to sign up. Even Demi Moore didn't disappoint. Her career has received a shot in the arm too. I will watch the sequels if they are made. Well done!",Mr. Brooks
125,ltlacey,A seemingly normal family man has an alternate life that consists of murder.,9,28 October 2008,"First off, welcome back to Mr. Costner and Mr. Hurt. Both were a treat to watch and the chemistry between the two worked well. The movie's premise reminds me a bit of Fight Club (same abnormal psychological issue), but unlike Fight Club, Mr. Brooks gives us more to work with. We have numerous people with some major issues and this factor alone is what makes this movie more interesting. First, we have Mr. Brooks (Costner) who is a serial killer ""managed"" by his evil trouble-making other personality, Marshall (Hurt). Okay, I like Hurt better than I like Pitt, but only because I think Hurt was able to convey evil better than Pitt, plus who could not love the scene where Marshall has himself a little temper tantrum when Earl Just Says No. Also, Dane Cook (surprise, surprise), almost unrecognizable with a face full of hair, gives the viewers another sicko to keep us entertained. I mean, what is worse: Someone with a schizo personality who kills people or someone who wants to come along and just watch (and learn)? Then of course we have the daughter, though the audience is left wondering if she is in fact a killer. For myself it was obvious that she inherited her father's disposition for killing (though in reality abnormal psychological traits are not inherited, though if she suspected or knew what her father did, and learned of it at an early age, then she would be validated in her own decision to become a killer). The cast is filled out with Demi Moore as the law officer on the trail of Mr. Brooks, and a task she has been doing for years. Of course she has her own problems to deal with, and Mr. Brooks somehow makes her problem go away. Though Moore is okay in this movie, I felt like something was missing in her performance. Actually, I felt that Moore just was not right for the role of Detective Atwood. She did not quite fit in with the rest of the ensemble or what this movie was all about. Then we have Helgenberger as Mrs. Brooks, and who seems to not want to know anything that goes on around her. Another person who is in need of some psychological help. I have read that Costner said that this was part of a trilogy, and one can hope that if this is so then we will keep the same staff and actors to keep the story going. Kind of like Dexter if you think about it. Maybe by the 2nd movie Moore will have added some oomph to her acting and give us a stronger performance.",Mr. Brooks

I didn't expect Mr. Brooks to be this good, but it is this good, being just about the best serial killer thriller I've seen since Se7en (okay, Zodiac was equally as good, but that was based in reality, and this wasn't), and that is a high honor. This didn't go in any direction that I expected, and while the ending was a tad lacking (only reason it didn't get a perfect score), the endless twists and turns the plot took were top notch all the way through.Mr. Brooks is not just a generic cop/serial killer Hannibal Lector ripoff; no, it's a dense, hard-boiled, multi-layered thriller with several different plot lines all weaving in and out of one another, forming just about the perfect example of my kind of movie.

129,kevin_crighton,"Good thriller, with a terrific Hurt/Costner double-act (plot details revealed)",7,13 October 2007,"Mr. Brooks seems to have the perfect life. Hugely successful in business, an attractive wife, a daughter in college. However, Mr. Brooks has a problem. He's also a serial killer.So begins the new thriller from Kevin Costner. Directed by Bruce A. Evans, who also co-wrote the screenplay, this is a smart thriller, greatly helped by a brilliant performance from Costner. As Brooks, he's not only convincing as a sane family man, he also convinces as a psychopath when killing. In this he's helped by a wonderful performance from William Hurt as Brooks's dark side. The scenes where they are talking to each other as if normal people are the best parts of the movie.The rest of the cast are fine. Dane Cook as Mr Smith, who witnesses Brooks killing a couple, then blackmailing him so he can go along the next time is good, as is Demi Moore as a cop investigating the killings. However, it's not without faults. Moore's cop (daughter of a rich man, in the middle of a messy divorce, also tracking down an escaped felon whom she put away before) has too much back story thrown in that can't be dealt with properly. Her character seems to make connections that others can't see, often without any evidence to support it. Mr. Smith's actions in wanting to watch Brooks in action killing someone, are never really explained. There doesn't seem to be any reason why he'd want to do it.There is a further sub-plot that suggests Brooks's daughter may be following in daddy's footsteps in more ways than one, but this is never resolved either way, resulting in an end dream sequence more from a horror movie than a good thriller.However, despite flaws in the script there are some good twists in the story, that aren't always the most obvious ones. And for a movie about a serial killer, it doesn't go for lots of violence. Here the deaths are pretty quick (gunshots mostly). It's a refreshing change. But then this movie is more a character study of a serial killer, than actually seeing him kill. Last movie I recall with a similar theme could be Henry Portrait Of A Serial Killer. This movie isn't as good as that, but for a Hollywood thriller, it's one of the best around.",Mr. Brooks
130,CrassActionHero,Does Not Quite Deliver All of The Goods,6,7 June 2007,"Mr. Brooks (2007) Review: First off, i'm quite young. Next, I normally do not pay much attention to Kevin Costner. So why did I see this? Is this good? Here's my take: Mr. Brooks is a rather different take on the average serial killer movie. Enter Earl Brooks(Kevin Costner) who is a wonderful human who has a wife, a daughter, and is an excellent business man who is also the man of the year, a class act all the way. Beneath this rather perfect exterior is the mind of a killer.Don't be deceived, Mr. Brooks is an addict. He is acquainted with a sinister alter-ego simply known to himself as Marshall(William Hurt), to whom he can speak with and hear. While at night, Mr. Brooks becomes a sadistic killer because he loves the rush he gets from the thrill of the kill.We also have, ""Mr. Smith""(Dane Cook) who is a peeping tom that sees Mr. Brooks commit murder and then gives Mr. Brooks a rather original offer. Talk about blackmail.Then we have Det. Tracy Atwood(Demi Moore) who is the detective working on this case with a lot of other stuff on her case as well.Now, what works about Mr. Brooks is that first is the acting. Kevin Costner is irresistibly sadistic as Mr.Brooks. Definitely one of his finest performances. Willian Hurt provides some dark humor to the movie with ease and has excellent delivery. Dane Cook, who I never liked, is actually very good as the sick peeping tom. Expect a few laughs from him, and Demi Moore is fine and is looking great these days.This is a much different movie than anyone will expect. This is also quite graphic at times. Mr. Brooks does have sometimes a sick sense of humor mixed in with lots of character development for our title character.Despite all of that, I was somewhat disappointed with Mr. Brooks. The subplot involving Demi Moore's character was unnecessary and I wanted to see more of Brooks at his most evil. So, I only slightly recommend this. This is not one the best, but I do give credit where credit is due.The Last Word: Eerie and twisted. Mr. Brooks is quite the little thriller that can. Not your typical Costner movie. That's for sure.",Mr. Brooks
131,Ozzy2000,"Demi Moore Alius ""Gimme More"" is too old for this action",5,6 February 2008,"Wealthy and successful Mr Brooks played by Kevin Costner is in the packaging business and wins ""Man of the Year"". The secret side to Mr Brooks is that he is a serial killer and he has his alter ego accompanying him on his secret killing spree who is played by William Hurt. It was sad to see a fine actor like William Hurt playing such a shallow a insignificant character. Mr Brooks otherwise lives a simple and happy family life in which his College kid daughter has found herself pregnant and apparently has secretly murdered some one at campus and therefore it get pretty weird. The very old and obviously geriatric Demi Moore ( aka ""Gimme More"") plays Detective Tracy Atwood who specialises in hunting down serial killers. At this stage the film goes from the sublime to the ridiculous when we learn that Det Atwood is a Multi Millionaire who chooses the very stressful and dangerous existence of a Homicide detective due to some reasoning which would indicate severe mental illness. Watching geriatric and heavily cosmetically and surgically reconstructed Demi Moore being thrown from speeding vehicles and collided full force with other vehicles only to get a minor head abrasion is laughable at the very least. In fact Demi's whole performance was a pathetic joke. Apparently some wannabee serial killer tries to enter a partnership with Mr Brooks but instead becomes one of his victims. Together with some couple of schmucks they get blamed for the spate of murders. Mr Brooks returns to his simple family life and his nightmares of his daughter trying to brutally murder him.

132,hoernkeem,"Mr. Brooks review(2007, Bruce A. Evans) Dark serial killer tale with Costner doing malevolent quite well.",6,9 February 2021,"Mr. Brooks (2007, Bruce A. Evans)
This is a 2007 thriller featuring Kevin Costner as the titular Mr. Brooks. It is a rare against type role for him as he is empirically the bad guy in the film. However, the way the film is constructed he still functions as the primary protagonist. By all accounts Earl Brooks is a stand up guy. He is winning Man of the Year awards and he is a self made rich guy via his box company empire. He also harbors a dark, secret life as an active, prolific serial killer known as the Thumbprint Killer. He has been wanting to quit, as he realizes killing for him is not only bad, but it is an addiction and he treats it as such up to and including going to and addict's anonymous style meeting. William Hurt plays Marshall who is a figment of Brooks' imagination and functions as the devil on his shoulder as well as his staunch meticulousness that has kept him safe and clean all these years.
I found this film interesting although I felt the story should have stuck primarily with Brooks and his dark tendencies. Instead the narrative takes a few multiple tracks that leave the story a bit bloated and simply trying to do too much. In ""Mr. Brooks"" primary narrative one slip leads a photographer played by Dane Cook to Mr. Brooks office. He has become the rare person to catch Mr. Brooks in the act of killing and instead of turning him in he attempts to blackmail the serial killer into teaching him his ways. Because that sounds super intelligent. There is also an odd side storyline involving Brooks' recently returned from college daughter and strong evidence that she may be a little chip off the old serial killer block which causes Mr. Brooks no end of consternation. Along with that there is the detective hunting Brooks played by Demi Moore and her mound of personal baggage which is rather hefty. I thought the entire thing was a bit bloated, but it wasn't so bad that the story was horrible. It just went in too many different directions. I thought the daughter angle certainly could have been abandoned and not cost too much. Demi Moore's detective tangent was interesting as our killer ends up liking her and even aiding her after a fashion so that is a very interesting dynamic for the story to explore, but I think they should have just streamlined her portions a bit more.
It is interesting that even in a bad guy role Kevin Costner doesn't stray too much from playing Kevin Costner. There are plenty of actors who can do that and do it successfully and he is one of them. The level of his range here extends to being slightly more meticulous and particular in his delivery, but really he is still just Kevin Costner, and that is not really a criticism just an observation. The cast here are all decent although I have never been a fan of Dane Cook, but he plays an unkempt a-hole which is about par for the course for him. The story does take some interesting twists and turns and while the entire enterprise didn't blow me away I did think it was very interesting and entertaining overall. Of note as well in the thriller world things can start to feel very derivative, but this had a decent amount of original thought, energy and execution in it which also added to the entertainment value.
Eric's Grade: B-",Mr. Brooks
133,nturner,Robert L. is Smiling,8,8 November 2008,"In the DVD special features of Mr. Brooks, the authors talk about their decision to write a screenplay that differs for others they have written and their process of expanding from the seed of an idea. At no time do they mention Robert Louis Stevenson's The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. They should have because their very enjoyable movie is basically another version of Stevenson's tale.Earl Brooks, on the surface, is a very good man. He has a loving wife and daughter and is noted for his charitable works - so much so that he has been honored with the local Man of the Year award. There is one ""minor"" flaw - he happens to be a blood thirsty serial killer. He doesn't really like being a murderer and attends Twelve-Step meetings in order to stave off his thirst for killing. All the while, his subconscious unmercifully nags him to give in to his evil yearnings. Mr. Brooks is not strong enough to resist and proceeds to murder a beautiful young couple he has seen dancing at a studio.Mr. Brooks is a careful man who plans every step of his crimes, but the latest is witnessed and photographed by ""Mr. Smith"" who lives across the way from the unlucky couple. Mr. Smith proceeds to blackmail Mr. Brooks but not for money. It seems that Mr. Smith wants to commit murder and wants an expert to show him how it is done.The investigation of the murder of the couple is being led by Detective Tracy Atwood who has quite a lot of baggage of her own. Her net value is sixty million dollars, yet she works as a police detective. She is in the midst of divorcing her second husband - who, like the first, married her for her money - and all is not going well. Tracy Atwood is not your run-of-the-mill cop.That's about all I can say about the storyline of this film without spoiling a number of the elements of the plot. It is quirky and far-fetched - at times comedic - but very entertaining in a ""let's sit back and watch some mindless fun"" sort of way.In addition to the quirky script and fine production values, Mr. Brooks is made especially entertaining by the excellent acting.Kevin Costner plays the lead role and is perfect for the part. He has the persona of an everyday good guy, but also has the acting skills to convince the viewer that he really could murder in cold blood and really enjoy doing so.Brooks's Mr. Hyde subconscious - named Marshall - is personified in this film by William Hurt, and he gives a wonderfully witty performance. I am reminded of the old cartoons I used to see as a child in which the character would have an angel on one shoulder and a devil on the other. Hurt is the perfect devil on the shoulder.Mr. Smith is played by comedian Dane Cook. Smith is an amoral young man who wishes to murder simply for the trill of the kill. He has no redeeming value. Cook does a very good job of showing us such a man whose type seems to be flourishing in our modern society.And then there is Detective Tracy Atwood who appears to be constantly wired and ready for action. Demi Moore is hot, sexy, and full of energy - the ideal Atwood.As I said, this movie is lots of fun. I think that old Robert Louis is probably smiling rather than spinning in his grave.",Mr. Brooks
134,dcobbimdb,"Good story, but little too far off the believable mark",6,1 September 2008,"While I liked the premise of the movie and did enjoy it to some extent, Mostly I just found too many aspects of it to be too far off the believability mark such that it ultimately spoiled it and kept reminding me throughout that I was watching a movie. But honestly this happens so often in movies today that's it's almost not worth mentioning too. Unlike most modern movies this one didn't overdue the CGI aspect, but it did push the believability net a little too much with certain points. Now movies typically do this to some regard as that's what's part of making entertainment, but certain aspects of this movie were just a little too overcooked.So rather than just watch and enjoy it for what it is I keep applying practicality, believability and simple laws of physics kind of logic which wasn't in the best interest of me enjoying or believing this movie.Subtle spoilers... For example in this movie, his wife being totally oblivious just seems absurd. Plus all his late night charades and yet he's awake and alert like any other normal guy who's had 8 hours of sleep, yeah right... At least Batman got that part right This whole concept, to think that one freak would witness a murder of a serial killer and rather than go to the cops or simply try to forget he blackmails the guy into teaching him the trade. That alone really had me reaching to cling on. Just a little to surreal, but okay accept that and just move on.Overall the whole movie played around Kevin's character and that's fine as he did a fine job of acting overall, but the other main characters seemed rather robotic and too scripted. I blame that more on the writing rather than the acting personally. Nothing really came as a shock to me. I knew pretty much everything coming, so there was really nothing in the way of surprise.The subplot regarding his daughter seemed so unneeded and ultimately a time filler. Demi's character, again too scripted and unneeded except for the fact that you have to have a detective trying to pick up the pieces. The other side plot of the guy she put away who was on the loose again a pointless side plot.I enjoyed the idea of Kevin's character and aspects of watching him work his night job along with his ego character, his attention to detail and reasoning. Pretty much everything else though including the other characters where robotic and poorly scripted. Overall a 6 out of 10",Mr. Brooks

136,Craig_McPherson,"Addiction has many, often dark forms",9,5 June 2007,"Kevin Costner as a serial killer? Would never work, you say? Well, you'd be wrong.In Mr Brooks, Costner's eponymous character is a decent family man, the CEO of a successful company, and the winner of Portland's Man of the Year award. But peel away the veneer and Earl Brooks is a tortured soul, so tormented by his inner demon (wonderfully portrayed by William Hurt) that he attends AA meetings, labeling himself an addict, although never disclosing the precise nature of his addiction.Meticulousness describes Earl Brooks' lifestyle. From his button-down bow-tie and glasses, to the restrained opulence of his home, everything speaks of a man for whom planning and thinking ahead is a lifestyle, almost to the point of obsessive compulsiveness.Mistakes are not part of Brooks' vocabulary, so when he does slip up, leaving the door open for a sycophant played by comedian Dane Cook to sashay into his life, Brooks finds himself out of his element, presented with a wild card that his high stakes game of poker potentially can't handle.Layered into the film's onion-like structure, are the stories of Detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore) hot on the trail of Brooks' ""thumbprint killer"" profile while finding herself stalked by another, far less ingenious psychopath escapee that she once put away, and that of Brooks' daughter (Danielle Panabaker) who seems to have inherited her father's bad-ass genes.Directed and co-written by Bruce A. Evans (who wrote the screenplay for the 1986 classic Stand By Me) and financed entirely out of pocket by Costner himself, Mr Brooks is the perfect example of an uncompromising script brought to life by an actor that believed in it. The end result? A surprisingly original movie that Hitchcock himself would have been proud of.",Mr. Brooks
137,Thorsten-Krings,Missed opportunity,4,7 November 2008,"To be honest, I thought the film was rather weak. First of all, it's actually all very predictable and in spite of Kostner's fine performance the script never really makes anything out of the contrast between the prim and proper businessman and the mass murderer. The story line meanders, can't really decide whose story to tell. The three story lines mean that the film lacks focus completely. The other thing is that the script is full of strange coincidences and twists that I just don't find very convincing. For me, the basic idea was quite interesting but the unfocused script turned it into a missed opportunity.",Mr. Brooks
138,Lucabrasisleeps,Something different from the lead actors,6,11 February 2009,"Well the best thing about this movie is the lead actors in the movie - Kevin Costner and Demi Moore. Till now I have seen both of them in boringly predictable characters which they did in a sedate manner. This movie is different in the sense that you see them perform their roles in an involved manner at least. It was definitely strange to see Kevin Costner as a serial killer considering his work in the past. But in this movie he does a good job.The plot may sound a bit ridiculous to some. A respected man in society, Earl Brooks(Kevin Costner) has a dark secret. He is also a serial killer known as the thumbprint killer. Thankfully in this movie, there are no elaborate gory murders or torture. They are simple and to the point. Tracy Atwood(Demi Moore) is a detective who is in search of the thumbprint killer. There is also a photographer named Mr.Smith(Dane cook) who witnesses the murder. What follows is an illogical sequence of events that may test the patience of some viewers. I, on the other hand, was entertained enough to watch till the end expecting some twist. The twist is - that there is no twist. It was quite predictable in the end and that disappointed me a bit. The movie moves fast enough and that is one of the good aspects of this movie.What raises this movie above the average thriller is the performances. I didn't expect much from Kevin Costner but he surprised me a bit here. His cold calculating killer character was quite effective and creepy. Even though this type of character has been done in many movies, Costner does it well in his own way. The scene where he finds out his daughter is pregnant, that is a moment he is ready to explode but he controls himself. That is an impressive scene which showcases the ability of Costner. Yet he hasn't chosen his roles well. Demi Moore as Tracy Atwood is my favourite in this movie. She is quite able to take on the mantle of the leading woman. IMO this is her best performance from the movies I have seen. In most movies she has a stony expression on her face all the time but in this one she has the look of a battle scarred veteran. She has the look of a woman who is quite capable of fighting her own battles without fear. In some ways, this character has a feminist slant. That is the best thing about this movie and this separates it from the average thriller. Her performance is quite intense and it would have been better if mainstream Hollywood movies had more such female characters in their movies. Dane cook does a good job as Mr.Smith although his character is not well written and this hurts the movie a lot. The music is also quite impressive and fits the movie perfectly. The screenplay should have been better and some of the twists are quite predictable.It is an effective thriller with good performances but the screenplay was lacking somewhat. The movie loses direction somewhat but it maintains a creepy tone throughout which is commendable.6/10",Mr. Brooks

Coupled by possibly the best acting by William hurt,Kevin Costner & demi moore + the rest of the cast makes this one of the best in its genre. A very good film! A solid 9/10 .

If Mr Brooks had been executed without the violence, then I would have enjoyed it more. As it is, it seems to say that serial killing is a legitimate hobby and painting your walls with blood is a reasonable thing to do.Although I admit to enjoying it at the time, the more I think about it the more it turns into self-indulgent twaddle. Mr Brooks having an imaginary friend, for example. I hoped that this odd character in the back seat would be explained at some time, but he never was. The DVD interviews revealed a little about who William Hurt was supposed to be, but it wasn't convincing.Did this flick ever get into cinemas? If it hadn't been recommended to me I might never have seen it until the hopefully toned down terrestrial TV showing in a few years -- probably at 2am. In summary, worth watching if you think motiveless serial killing is a good thing and you like blood.",Mr. Brooks
142,thomvic,"Spooky, dramatic, suspenseful.....Mr Brooks sure has it all!",9,21 August 2010,"I watched this not sure what to expect. I didn't know much about this movie and the only real reason it appealed to me is because I have a bit of a soft spot for Demi Moore - the other actors were alright. It wasn't until I watched it that you really see the talents of these actors, in particular from Kevin Costner.Mr Brooks is not a typical thriller - for one, your main character Mr Earl Brooks is essentially the villain as he is a serial killer, but the thing is he is so likable and a normal family man that you can't help but actually root for him in some ways. In particular, it seems that the villains in the film are more the non criminals who are nasty in their own ways with the other sub plots involving Demi Moore as Detective Tracy Atwood out hunting for her prey. I think Moore has found something decent in this role which doesn't have to rely on her body, and she actually does a good job as a cop who has her own motives for constantly searching for criminals.There are a lot of plot twists in this which sometimes takes it away from the central plot, but it all ties together in the end which makes it quite satisfying. It may seem horrid to say this, but with some Earl Brooks' victims he kills, it made me think 'you had it coming' (it makes sense if you watch it) Dane Cook is an interesting choice for a serious role but he pulls it off and is convincing. His character is meant to be a stupid dim witted character in his own right so he makes it all very believable.The plot is suspenseful and also dramatic at the same time. You really see the struggle that Mr Brooks has with himself and his alter ego Marshall (played by William Hurt spectacularly) who only Mr Brooks can hear and see and no one else can. It's almost like schizophrenia.The beauty of the film to me is that the ending isn't one that essentially has a final conclusion but keeps you thinking about what could happen in the future for the characters (and man the final ending is one of the highlights). You really feel you see these tortured characters and understand them and what they are doing, though Dane Cook's character is a bit of a weirdo.Highly recommended. It plays out well, isn't typical of most thrillers and is most definitely worth your time.",Mr. Brooks
143,butchfilms,I can't believe Kevin Costner didn't receive any nomination for his role in here,7,13 December 2008,"""Mr. Brooks"" is a very good mystery thriller film where we can watch the best performance of Kevin Costner's acting career, I can't believe he didn't get any award and what is worse any nomination for his work in here.The pace in which the film develops is great, the conversations between Mr. Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner) and his alter ego Marshall (a great William Hurt)are a pleasure to watch, the two actors have a great chemistry. I also liked the performance of the actor who plays ""Mr. Smith"". On the other hand Demi Moore was just OK like the Detective Tracy Atwood, I think the subplot of this character with another criminal of her past decreases interest to the movie instead of adding it (eventhoug is a little entertaining but seem parts of other movie, an action movie one). If the movie wouldn't have this subplot I would have given 8 stars to ""Mr. Brooks"".The plot is about how a nice guy is a real serial killer who tries to quit killing but his alter ego always convinces him to keep murdering. If you like thriller movies this is a must see for you.",Mr. Brooks

145,native_girl333,A Dark Passion,8,22 March 2008,"Kevin Costner is Mr.Brooks who owns a successful company. On the outside he looks just like any normal family-man but he has a very dark side. He likes to kill people. He has done it in the past and now it is again time to unleash the beast...Detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore) has hunted a merciless killer for a while. Now he is killing again. This time Tracy wants to get him and lock him up for good. The twisted plans of Mr.Brooks goes asunder when a photographer (Dane Cook) takes pictures of him while he's executing his passion and starts to blackmail our killer. The way Mr.Smith is blackmailing Mr.Brooks is not a typical way... At the same time Mr.Brooks has a different kind of problems with his daughter Jane (Danielle Panabaker).Mr.Brooks is a very good thriller. The director Bruce A.Evans has explored the question that can a person manage to have a normal life and still have a passion of killing, and can this passion be inheritable. Mr.Brooks is reminds of serial killers like Ted Bundy who was charming and smart but had a very dark mind. The movie is surprising and thrilling. Acting is in order. Kevin Costner makes a one of his best performances in years. William Hurt is brilliant as Marshall. Demi Moore is good as a tough detective Atwood.Mr.Brooks is one of the best thrillers of the year 2007!",Mr. Brooks
146,ernesti,A mediocre thriller with an unusual herring,4,14 August 2012,"I found it hard to make a decision on what grade i should give this movie. Sometimes it raises above average and at times falls back into using typical clichés.It seems obvious that there isn't much of a cat & mouse chase if the identity of the killer is known. However it doesn't matter as the movie has quite a few plot lines that are connected together.What irritated me the most is that this movie could have been a lot better without Demi Moore doing Matrix, getting abducted but still able to beat the bad guys, Demi Moore knowing everything just before anything had even happened and Demi Moore in an unrealistic shooting scene and flashing lights. After all it could have been better with someone else playing the role of the police investigator than Moore. The whole plot of Moore being a multimillionaire who is extorted by his ex-husband for millions of dollars is just quite lame.Not to mention Mr Brooks's (Costner) daughter who seemingly had begun following in her father's path. It seemed quite unbelievable in many levels.So what this movie lacks above all is a sense of style. It just isn't stylish at all. The subject of the movie isn't easy but in my opinion it could have worked better in a dream-like setting than in the ""real world"".The last thing that i found quite irritating that there isn't clear punishment for Mr Brooks for what he had done. Was the whole point of the movie like this ""You can do evil things and get a way with it if u just know to stop at some point."" I don't usually moralize movies but i just can't help doing it now.Mr Brooks tries hard not to be just a thriller but actually fails to be anything else than just a Hollywood thriller. It's still fun.",Mr. Brooks

Respected by the community, loved by his family the hidden side of him that is the real 'he' is a cold-blooded murderer, with a killing streak of hundreds stretching through the years.It is frightening to watch his character, frightening to watch him silently contemplate his next move, plan to the smallest detail and then absorb and enjoy the emotion of his deadly acts.With all this I want to say that this is an impressive movie, very dark journey to the mind of a serial killer, and a dive into his soul - where surprisingly we also find love to his wife and daughter. While Mr.Brooks can make the difference between good and evil, he is painfully aware that even if he can fight his dark side, he can't really stop himself, even if he tries but setting up his own death.And the worst that he sees in the future is that his own daughter is unknowingly following his steps....Now, it would be too much to expect a Miss Brooks movie, where father and daughter are killing side by side, but in the meanwhile - do watch this movie if you're looking for a dark thriller that prompts more thinking as to who really might be the man sitting just next to you, the woman reading a book in the same café, somebody driving a car in the opposite laneDark, very well produced with nice cast and script, if it was directed by Oliver Stone (like 'Natural born killers') perhaps, or Q.Tarantino or David Lynch it would've been more demonic, but it is pretty frightening the way it is, if you watch it seriously and not just for the fun of it9/10peace",Mr. Brooks
148,vovazhd,Unsettling account of a tortured existence,7,23 December 2007,"Mr. Brooks is a movie about a man with an addiction. That is, an addiction to killing. The plot revolves around that man, Mr. Brooks. He leads a successful life (both as a businessman and husband), and even earns the local ""Man of the Year"" award. But he decides to start killing people again after a two year hiatus. Due to open curtains in the room where he commits his murder, he is seen and has to arrange a deal with the man who photographed him. What comes out is a very compelling and peculiar plot.There is an added dimension with the presence of Mr. Marshall, an imaginary companion to Mr. Brooks. His appearance is that of an older and wiser Mr. Brooks, but has the unbearable urge to persuade Mr. Brooks to kill. Sometimes he talks with a robotic voice (as does Mr. Brooks occasionally), but I feel it was meant to be this way. Another intriguing personality comes from Mr. Brooks' daughter, who looks like a normal girl on the outside but may have developed her own addiction to killing. There is a detective on the case who is another interesting addition to the already developed cast. She does her job not for money, but for her own personal reasons. This leads her to be a dangerous obstacle for Mr. Brooks. The final major character is Mr. Smith, the man who photographs Mr. Brooks' murder. The reason why he doesn't turn in the photographs immediately is because he wants to feel the rush of killing someone, and asks Mr. Brooks to teach him how to murder. In addition to this, there are several other important characters, but not worth mentioning here.The plot started off excellent and built up good suspense. It felt a little overlong at times, but generally was paced very well. The conclusion was good but went a little too far. Although I see some meaning in the last two scenes, I think they should have just been cut. The whole movie is dark psychological journey but also has some comedy and action. It was really fascinating to see a detective movie from the viewpoint of the killer rather than the protagonist. Recommended for people who like detective or psychological themes.",Mr. Brooks
149,lopcar1993,A true psychological thriller!,8,30 January 2009,"Mr. Brooks is a clique film no doubt about it, but those cliques end up turning into an original and shocking film that you just can't resist. Mr. Brooks delves into deep into the psychological aspect of Multiple Split Personality Disorder or MSPD for short. The films show a man battling with himself, trying to fight the urges to kill. But his other half has such control over him and his desires that Earl Brooks just can't help himself. Mr. Brooks works very well as a film. It tells a story that very few people can relate but most of us can understand, A man battling his inner demons. Trying to resist the urge to kill, trying but failing to break the habit; but the one big question you should be asking yourself is not why but how. How can a mild mannered businessman and father turn into such a monster? That's the big question, and here's the answer, we may never know. Or perhaps we are not meant to know. Mr. Brooks is an amazing film that blends mind blowing suspense and horror that will leave you looking over your shoulders for weeks. I very, very highly recommend this movie.",Mr. Brooks
150,beregic,highly entertaining regardless of your stands on the subject itself,10,1 June 2008,"first i must say that the character developments here are outstanding;well detailed with a certain ""realism"" written all over. somehow this feels like the serial ""dexter"" in a much condensed form. this movie passed under my radar when it first came out, mostly because its been long since i discarded Kevin Costner as an actor that has ""something to say"" or being able to ""entretain"" at least; he always seemed so ""dull"" to me. but 20 minutes or less into Mr brooks mind and i was hooked, he is perfect for this role EXACTLY because its dullness, that is well adjusted to fit him perfectly in the killer's shoes. also worthy to mention is Demi Moore both as actor and character; at first glance a ""stereotype"" female cop that evolves in a ""male"" one; quiet interesting for me her character evolution, and her looks are dead on the money for pulling this off! like in ""dexter"", there are many moments where you will feel both conditional and unconditional sympathy for Mr. Earl Brooks and can not ""explain"" it...as Morban, his ideology sustains his vice , but more expanded as to include adultery as well(frankly i had no sympathy there, but that is just a ""part"" of his ""complex"").the plot contains two other wicked characters worth mention! Danielle Panabaker as Jane Brooks (his daughter) brings a very interesting TENNSION to the movie. the father's ""reasoning"" going about will prove irresistible to watch for any as such, real life family relations. also Dane Cook as the ""appertinence"" serial killer in the making; somehow a bit of a cliché, but this character brings very relevant tragic-comic moments.the production has replay-value, not as much because the suspense(i would not actually consider it a ""traditional"" thriller) but because the way everything ""blends"" in and how ""casual"" everything goes about; as well as the witty dialogs and monologues, always refreshing.the soundtrack match the scenes and the camera work is ""average"" but irrelevant(interesting). it does not seems like a big production but certainly feels like one.i recommend this to anyone in the mood for a dark ""thriller"", something that will get and keep you thinking throwout; something that is not about ""hate"" or ""love"" in traditional form but in universal terms of existence.",Mr. Brooks
151,newblu,Peep This Reviews,8,9 July 2017,Strong candidate for one of the best serial killer movies ever made. A strong mystery throughout and features some rather interesting sub-plots to boot.

152,alexkolokotronis,Costner Worthy of Oscar Nomination,8,20 February 2008,"For now I will review the movie overall. This movie has some both good and bad parts to it. The good parts of it were the writing, William Hurt and Kevin Costner. The bad were Demi Moore and Dane Cook. When I watched movie it was not really what I expected. It had some other elements to it such as Kevin Costner's thought process and his family. The idea of putting William Hurt in this movie was great and very creative casting him as Kevin Costner's mind. This was very original in many way and displayed something different and unique that has not been really shown in serial killer movies. The best part of this movie was Kevin Costner's performance. His performance was probably the most unique and different compare to other serial killer movies, making his character realistic. The movie was mostly based and revolved around him it allowed for his character to develop and open up. He showed something that I would never expect from Kevin Costner. He was perfect fit because he displayed exactly how many psychopaths are: intelligent, calm and precise. He also fit perfectly because it actually made sense that someone with a personality and status like Costner's could actually be like a Jack the Ripper sort of person. He displayed how he is fighting himself(William Hurt) on whether he should kill or not. But like most psychopaths it eventually becomes repetitive and automatic. He had this obsessive compulsion of just killing people. Costner shows how he is in constant pain and just cannot escape his temptations and paranoia. It was really amazing watching him and William Hurt together. I think the ending perfectly illustrated his performance.What really ruined this movie was Demi Moore. She just did not bring anything at all to this story. She did not seem into the character and was just too average. Dane Cook was just really not a fit at all. When I look at him I think comedy. He was not too convincing and kind weirded me out the wrong way. That could be a good thing though. Believe or not this movie does have a message showing how are temptations can eventually take over us if we give into them. It shows by giving in you are really going for the quick fix and not thinking long term.",Mr. Brooks
153,Thunderbuck,This is a VERY black comedy...,9,24 November 2007,"MR BROOKS is a clever, original movie, but I think one needs to approach it in the right frame of mind. This is in no way a serious crime drama, or even much of a thriller, but it IS a nifty little black comedy.Both Costner and Hurt are clearly having a lot of fun here (and I suspect their relationship was based on a lot of late night ""conversations"" between co-writers Evans and Gideon). The whole ""internal dialogue"" device works better than it probably should have, in part because both of these guys are so comfortable with it. The pretentious might try to suggest that there is some kind of serious moral struggle going on in Costner's Mr. Brooks, but there really isn't.As for the other players, it's great to see Demi Moore on screen again; she's fantastic here. Dane Cook is pretty neat, too. He is clearly CAPABLE of putting out a good performance. Unfortunately, the lovely Marg Helgenberger is kind of wasted here, but it's still nice to see her.I don't know if it's a GREAT ending, exactly, but it isn't horrible, and the whole point of this movie is the characters more than actual plot anyway. I enjoyed this film a LOT more than I expected. If you ""got"" ""American Psycho"", this will likely work for you, too.Screenwriters Bruce Evans and Ray Gideon wrote two 80s classics (STARMAN and STAND BY ME), and have both sadly kind of languished since (they did KUFFS, too). This sharp, snappy little film shows they've still got something happening.",Mr. Brooks

Kevin Costner's chilling performance steals the show and is a real return to form for an actor who has really dropped off the radar while Hurt and Moore also deserve notable mentions for their good performances.Overall, a very good film and everything you want from a thriller.

155,cafesmitty,"Good Movie, But way too busy",6,24 June 2014,"I like the movie, didn't love it and it is a rental at best. Costner plays a ""serial"" killer name Mr. Brooks.

Someone witness his latest killing and now that person wants something. Meanwhile Demi Moore plays a local detective going through a hard divorce. She is brilliant at her job, but her divorce got her distracted a bit. She is ""assigned"" to the Mr. Brooks case. This movie could have been and should have been better.. especially the end.. they had the perfect ending and they they went an additional 5 minutes too far. Because what happened before was brilliant. But the biggest problem with the movie is that they had about 4 different stories going on. The movie lacked serious focus. And pretty much 2-3 of the stories didn't really enhance the movie... Therer was Mr. Brooks; Demi's Divorce; Demi's other case; and Mr. Brooks daughter. Because of the lack of focus, I give this film 6 out of 10.",Mr. Brooks
156,mike-925,Mr. Brooks Is Fundamentally Sound!,7,4 June 2007,"Mr. Brooks is a surprisingly good plot, but the dialog and logic get dicey and out of control at times.Kevin Costner is Mr. Brooks (Brothers). He is the quintessential successful businessman who owns his own company. He has an interesting sideline too, that few people know about: He's a serial killer. Its not that he's not remorseful about it, he attends AA meetings, where he confesses that he is 'addicted.'Mr. Brooks has a wife and a daughter in college. More important, he has an alter ego, Marshall, a conscience without a conscience, played by William Hurt. Marshall is invisible to everyone but Mr. Brooks. The film opens with Brooks killing a couple who like to open their bay window so everyone can watch them make love. In Burbank and greater LA where Mr. Brooks operates, the Press has dubbed him the Thumb Killer. He and Marshall discuss murder and its problems regularly but no one else can hear them.Film makers have discovered that family, once verboten in all films, is now practically a requirement in any film for adults. At some point, Brooks learns his daughter has quit school because of a pregnancy, but later he learns she's a serial killer too. Its a complication that hardly matters to the plot so you just assume the writer threw it in to add a family element.A few days after killing the couple, Brooks finds a brooding young man with a beard in his outer office. The man, Mr. Brown sends photos in showing Brooks shutting the curtains of the house with the two dead victims laying on the bed behind him. With Marshall and he conferencing on this development, Mr. Brown is invited in to discuss what he wants. Mr. Brown wants to participate in the next murder. But Marshall and Brooks, like the audience, have their doubts about this guy. Demi Moore is a cheeky heiress who pursues the Thumb Killer. She's on the LAPD, while trying to dump a gigolo hubby who wants a big settlement. The plot starts getting real complicated. Marshall and Mr. Brooks decide to kill Demi's hubby and lawyer girlfriend, pinning the crime on Mr. Brown or possibly on Demi. Its not exactly clear which. Then Brooks visits Stanford and kills another student using the same MO his daughter employed when she killed her first victim. Later he tells the daughter someone in Palo Alto has killed another college victim there. She doesn't appear to figure out that it was Mr. Brooks, her father, who did it, or even care that the new murder helps deflect attention from her.On some level, this film is a bit of a comedy. Mr. Brooks keeps changing his mind about what to do about Mr. Brown. Finally Brooks makes Brown disappear and points suspicion for the couple murder at Brown. But Demi Moore isn't so dumb that some of this isn't starting to make her wonder too. Demi's a little short on things to do, so the writers develop a story about a killer Demi sent up, busting out of prison and wanting revenge. Costner's Brooks is a little bored too. So he offs Demi's revenge killers too. For no real reason.Despite all the things wrong with the film, it is a pleasure to watch. The movie surprises all the time. Its a thriller in which the audience doesn't always know who to rout for. In the end, no character is found to be anything less than self-serving. In a film world of heroes and villains, a film without a hero is a nice touch. I can't even remember what happened to Mr. Brooks because its hard to care. Dane Cook is adequate as the blackmailing Mr. Brown as is Demi Moore in her sketchy cop role. Brooks and Marshall's conversations often seem forced and unreal. Dane Cook's Mr. Brown is dumber, often, than his character should be, but sometimes he is too smart too. The storytellers make his character uneven and somewhat unbelievable. This film works wonderfully despite all these flaws.Finally, the film has performed a great public service: It has taken the edge off all those Hannibal Lecter horror stories that have started to bore us. A serial killer doesn't have to be a terrible grind. He can be a nice guy. In its way, Mr. Brooks sends up Hannibal, news media horror stories about serial killers and the myth that all serial killers are alike. If Mr. Brooks isn't Mr. Blanding, Mr. Blonde or Mr. Moto, he's still a character the audience can make an emotional investment in, his own lack of emotion notwithstanding.",Mr. Brooks

I was quite surprised and completely pleased with Kostner and cast for giving a real loaded roller-coaster ride in this flick. There were many deep concepts and ironies in this storyline. I felt almost anxious for the ending and yet not wanting for it to conclude in the usual generic fashion. The elements of how various characters intertwine is interesting in itself and the directing, cinema filming, and editing are all superb. This may well go down as one of my favorites of the year. I have to say that if you miss this one you are going to be sorry.",Mr. Brooks

161,FilmCreature,FilmCreature Reviews 'Mr. Brooks',5,6 July 2008,"I wanted to like 'Mr. Brooks'. The concept is nice, I thought the twist with the daughter was great (however preposterous), and Kevin Costner and Demi Moore take their roles very seriously. But as the films plodded along, it simply seemed to get more and more contrived and indulgent, and less of the intelligence and introspection that real cinephiles crave from a movie like this. I quote Richard Roeper: ""It's never boring, but neither is stepping on glass."" Earl Brooks (Costner) is an ordinary family man, and as the film opens, he is receiving a ""Man of the Year"" award, and seems to be an all-around great guy. Then, of course, we discover he leads two lives: one as a loving father and husband, and another as a passionless serial killer ominously nicknamed ""The Thumbprint Killer"". Brooks is constantly goaded by an imaginary familiar named Marshall (William Hurt). His cold-blooded imaginary ""friend"" encourages his thrill-killing. He knows the killing is what drives him; a source of pleasure.Demi Moore then steps in as Homicide Detective Tracy Atwood, a true police expert who is great at what she does and knows it. She is simultaneously hunting The Thumbrint Killer and being hunted herself, by a notorious serial killer known as ""The Hangman,"" as well as going through a divorce worth millions. Moore delivers an impressive performance as a tough cop; it's rather surprising how well she fits into the role.Costner does great work here as a man who can subtly change from an emotionless murderer into a benevolent father and husband.The liked the ""killer"" (heh heh) twist with the daughter in a feminist sort of perspective: you don't see many female serial killers in film, and it's a fresh idea to play upon.But the filmmakers don't go deep enough into untreaded waters for me to give it a recommendation. By the end, the film has smothered itself in gore and unrealistic circumstances. Oh, yeah, and I hate to say it, but Dane Cook cannot act.2/4",Mr. Brooks

167,God-12,Quite fun if a little predictable,5,7 August 2007,"I couldn't really avoid going to see this - not that it is that rare for people to be my namesake. They should have called it 'Mr. Smith' or 'Mr. Wong' and they'd have had a much bigger audience just for that reason.On the whole I enjoyed this film, it jogged along in a fairly predictable fashion, but it was fun going along with it all. The most remarkable thing about it was the actor Kevin Costner - I'd seen him in a few films before and wondered why anybody hired him because he was so utterly wooden. I truly didn't believe him capable of acting at all. I wouldn't say he was brilliant in this film either, but, amazingly, quite a few times he acted well enough that you didn't think 'oh, it's that prat Costner', which made the film a lot more enjoyable.Also the actress Julia Roberts was less disturbing to look at. In the past I've always wondered if she had a hare-lip or some other problem with her mouth that distracted me from anything she said. With age her lips have thinned down and, though she looks a bit gaunt, she doesn't look abnormal, so that helped too. Her acting was fairly underwhelming, but this is the first time I've had a chance to watch her act.The plot was OK, and I don't want to give anything away to anybody who might want to watch it, but I wasn't sure what the imaginary friend was supposed to be about. Was it supposed to be a schizophrenic delusion - which wouldn't fit well with anything else? Was it supposed to be some sort of spook - in which case, why didn't we have any explanation of why there should be a spook about? Was it, rather, supposed to be some sort of view of an old fashioned id/ego problem? This confused matters further as I wasn't clear if there was some sort of sub-plot in which psychopathy was supposed to be heritable - because it wasn't clear if it was supposed to be psychopathy or schizophrenia or something completely different.I felt that whoever was responsible for plotting or giving expert advice was hired very cheaply.I suppose it is possible to have your own private cemetery. I wonder why there isn't a bigger second hand market for them if they are so handy.Did anybody notice the parking ticket that magically disappeared - I wouldn't mind getting one that did that!",Mr. Brooks
168,raimund-berger,Ruined by Moore.,4,21 July 2007,"OK, so here's another serial killer flick, but this time with a slightly different angle. Whoever thought Costner might give the evil character here can relax, because he doesn't. In fact, he's just addicted to killing and doesn't really enjoy it, very much like some people don't enjoy smoking any more but still can't quit. Which makes for a role he still fits in to, and he performs it astonishingly well. Although, admittedly, with the help of some fancy lighting.Additionally, there's that plain old alter ego, this time actually given on screen by William Hurt, and the seamless blending of their dialog into everyday situations provides for one of several neat twists the film has to offer. Since it isn't that much about killing though, a blackmailing scheme is thrown in to beef up the story, and all this works out really well and makes for a good thriller, especially due to the entertaining Costner/Hurt pairing and, not to forget, Marg Helgenberger giving the nice and lovely wife that asks no questions.One minor weakness is a pretty spectacular, final gotcha which stretches things a little too much, especially with regard to realistic assumptions about what makes a serial killer. The real bummer though is the introduction of a second story line, consisting of a female cop - Demi Moore - being on Costner's trail and doing other stuff. In fact, mostly doing other stuff, totally unrelated to the main story.Now, since Mrs. Moore stopped being cute it's become pretty hard to deny that she can't act. Accordingly her performance here, where she's once more desperately trying to give the tough lady, is forced and uninvolving at best. Also, the film makers made the mistake to give her no equal sized partner, so she's basically getting half of the total screen time opposing the incredibly strong Costner/Hurt duo. Now, with all due respect, how was that ever supposed to gonna work out? If it was in any way, I can assure you it doesn't. In fact, while watching this movie I became increasingly annoyed by these issues, and that's essentially how I remember it: being a nuisance. Thanks to Mrs. Moore, and the geniuses who cast her into this miswritten part.Final verdict: wasted. Great job guys, you really blew it.",Mr. Brooks

During his latest ritual, he makes a terrible mistake, and accidentally shares his dark secret with a nosy neighbor, enter Mr. Smith (Dane Cook).Mr. Smith is intrigued by what captivates Mr. Brooks, and he wants to be part of it.Detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore) is hot on the case though. Trailing the acts of the two as closely as possible. Eventually she becomes personally involved, as Mr. Brooks cleverly incorporates her personal life with his addiction.This is a good movie and is enjoyable as a psycho thriller. The acting is solid, Costner and William Hurt (as Marshall) work well together and complement each other in their roles. However the story does have a couple plot holes, which for me prevent it from scoring higher, although 7/10 is a strong rating anyway.",Mr. Brooks
170,derekauthor,...is Really a Serial Killer (!),10,27 October 2007,"Kevin Costner plays well-respected and successful businessman Earl Brooks, who has a loving wife and pretty daughter. But he also is a serial killer that detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore) is trying to capture.The film gives us a chance to experience the thoughts of a crafty, ""professional"" serial killer -- thanks to the great performance by Costner and the addition of his character's conscience (played by William Hurt). Dane Cook does a good job as a man who wants to experience ""the rush"" of killing somebody. There's also a wow of an ending.Takes place in Oregon but filmed in Louisiana.",Mr. Brooks
171,sueelaine,Lots of twists,9,21 September 2020,"Not a routine movie at all. Lots of plot twists and turns I never saw coming. Although I am not at all a Demi Moore fan and that role could have been cast with a better actor, I still enjoyed the movie.",Mr. Brooks
172,luke-346,A meticulous execution of a movie!,7,7 June 2008,"Mr. Brooks is a film that follows a meticulous and deeply psychotic serial killer that executes his victims via a distinct modus operandi that sees him labeled by detectives as the thumb print killer. Directed by Bruce A. Evans and starring Kevin Costner, William Hurt, Demi Moore and Dane Cook the film deviates slightly from the familiar thriller genre with various subplots, portmanteau narrative and clever use of the doppelganger motifs and facets - the chief of which is the psychomachia, or rather the struggle between virtue and vice in the individual. Fans will know that this method of storytelling is also used films like ""Dr Jekyll & Mr. Hyde"" and ""Fight Club"".Mr. Brooks revolves around its lead, the serial killer Mr. Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner), and his fastidious methods of execution and punctilious attention to detail. The film establishes its motives quite quickly, through introducing his ""imaginary friend"" called Marshall (William Hurt) on a car journey back from a business event. On this journey Marshall intersperses Mr Brooks and his wife's dialogue with his thoughts. Shortly after the journey Marshall and Earl start discussing and bickering over the events that will be taking place that night, clearly here Earl is grappling with his conscience as he chooses whether or not to kill again after a gap of two years. His counterpart wins and Earl embarks on a mini voyage of execution only to succumb to a series of unavoidable occurrences that result in compromising his freedom. From here on in everything that happens seems to deviate into its own narrative, almost independent of the others at play. The beauty of the film lays in its ability and ambition at attempting this. This is due to the fact the meta-narratives culminate in the portmanteau narrative which, of course, leads to a single conclusion. This apparatus of story-telling has been used before in cinema, most notably ""Amores perros"", ""Taxadermia"" and the widely known ""Magnolia"", but here it is slightly different as the characters do interact that bit more and the finale is considerably more shocking, A favored aspect of the film for me was the use of music as at times it complemented the stylish direction and was ultimately one of the best aspects of the film. A great example of this is when Earl is on the prowl for a victim, as here the audience sees the neighborhood world from the comfort of his car. Each camera shot combines a slow tracking pan with melancholic music that elicits audience trepidation and apprehension at his next move. Despite the fact the scene harks back to of some of the early 90s ""hood"" films, because it has a distinct drive-by feel to it, it nevertheless still feels fresh and well executed.The casting of the film is very interesting and although Costner's performance has divided some critics, it can be fair to say that this isn't the best film he's been in but it is, in my opinion, his best performance in a film. He has clearly matured as an actor, thus managing to conduct himself in accordance with the expectations of a character with such deep psychotic predispositions. William Hurt is equally as good, and as the plot progresses he brilliantly begins to exhibit some of the tendencies that were once the character traits of Earl at the beginning of the film. The fact that the two characters begin to switch in motives and rarely agree illustrates further the doppelganger narrative at play. The casting of Dane Cook as the aspirant and dilettante accomplice was a surprise, but was well received - much better than the misogynistic ""Good Luck Chuck"" he appeared in earlier this year.Finally, Mr. Brooks is a good psychological thriller that is both well written and well directed, the performances are all good with perhaps the exception of Demi Moore, she gives a satisfactory performance but next to the other actors she unfortunately looks mediocre. The ending is a bit circumspect, alluding to the fact there could have been a final re-edit to please audiences, but as I have recently found out the film could be the first of trilogy and that would help to explain the final few reels. Mr. Brooks is a film that I would recommend to those that like films that are ambitious and veer off the beaten genre track... but in an interesting and creative way.",Mr. Brooks
173,MovieCritic20497,Stunning,8,6 July 2007,"All the performances were by far some of the greatest of the summer season of 2007. Kevin Costner so far deserves recognition for his role as Mr. Brooks, the title character. I found it amazing how Costner and his alter ego, Marshall, played by William Hurt, were able to communicate and no other character could hear it. I thought that it was well done. There are unnecessary events that go on, like most of Demi Moore's role throughout the movie. Her character does need to be noticed, but her character was just too involved in the movie. It would have been better with less of her and more of something else. I would have liked to see how Mr. Brooks started killing in the first place or how he managed to get his imaginary friend. There are some movies out there that you never want to end and you could sit there and watch it for a long time. That is how I felt after watching Mr. Brooks. The ending is haunting and it leaves you begging for more. I hear rumors of this being a trilogy, which would be sad because it ended in a good place. Overall, 8.5/10.",Mr. Brooks
174,dustinhunter707,"Terrible, could have been so much better",5,29 October 2007,"OK I was expecting so much more from this movie than what I got, It dragged along for the first 90 minutes horribly and the only murders you see is the very first one. The other murders that happen are just talked about and maybe the crime scenes are visited and I thought that was really stupid because they played it out like it was a made for TV movie because none of the murders are shown until like the last 20 minutes of the film and that makes it really suck. I was expecting some strong bloody violence like it says in the ratings and there are only like 2 scenes of it in the whole film. I am not a big Kevin Costner fan but I liked Waterworld, The Untouchables, and 3000 Miles to Graceland but this one wasn't in his best interest. Demi Moore and Dane Cook did a pretty good job, but the movie was poorly written. Overall I give this a 5 out of 10 because the last 20 minutes of the film weren't bad, but the first 100 minutes were just terrible and I was bored. I wouldn't recommend this to all thriller fans, but if your bored and if you're a Kevin Costner or Demi Moore fan, then go for it but you may be disappointed.",Mr. Brooks

176,jcbinok,Well Done,9,29 May 2020,"A psycho-killer-thriller drama well worth watching. Kevin Costner's (superego) internal monologues with William Hurt (id) are a wonderful device. Very effective for getting us inside his mind. KC's life of precision, consistent throughout, contrasts nicely with Dane Cook's amateurish wannabe character and the daughter's fumbling immaturity.Demi Moore chips in with one of her best performances.My only complaint is the secondary story line of the ""Hangman"". I understand that the writers wanted to flesh out Moore's cop life. But, it felt like too much screen time was used on that, without much payoff. In fact, the scene where she and her partner find another hanged victim was confusing and weirdly lit. Seemed forced.Nevertheless, there's enough good stuff to say of this movie...***RECOMMENDED***",Mr. Brooks
177,palainausa,"3 for ""Star Power""",3,16 October 2018,"Because otherwise it stunk. The gimmick of the alter ego was good for a couple of minutes. The photographer wants to be an apprentice serial killer? The daughter is an ax murderer? The detective is so sure of herself that she assaults another cop? Dream sequences? Stick-on beards? Bullets that always go through victims for culprit retrieval? Loose ends, for sure. A film of me attempting to resist Wavy Lays would be more interesting.",Mr. Brooks
178,lucasaq-1,"Intense, unsettling, and thrilling",7,19 June 2007,"I must say that William Hurt is one creepy and dark actor. He does not have much range, but what he does he does excellent and he hits the mark perfectly in this film. In this film, William Hurt plays Kevin Costner's subconscious gone wild. Mr. Brooks, Costner's character, is a serial killer known as the Thumb Killer. He does it for the thrill and admits he is addicted. That is the basis for the film. He is trying to stop, but Hurt talks him into returning to form after a two year absence. Detective Tracy Atwood is brought on the case as she is the one who went after the killer before and things get really messy when a Mr. Smith (alias, doesn't give his real name to Mr. Brooks) wants in on the action Mr. Brooks is having. His, Mr. Smith's, way in? Black mail. Namely pictures of Mr. Brooks at the scene of the crime.I originally went into this film expecting it to be about a hit man who retired and was brought by in my boss man Hurt, but I was completely wrong and instead got the inner workings of serial killer. Costner is very calculating as is Hurt. Their banter together is quite good and funny at times, easing the tense atmosphere. Demi Moore surprises as the detective in the middle of crisis with a divorce and another killer coming after her after escaping from prison. Dane Cook is the odd ball as the nervous Mr. Smith.The film is intense, unsettling, and thrilling. The second best crime film of the year behind Zodiac, Ocean's Thirteen doesn't count.",Mr. Brooks
179,fuadkhan2002,True-to-life account of a serial killer!,8,14 May 2016,"OK, I think this is the closest that you could ever come to seeing and meeting a real life serial killer in all his perverse psychology on display. Kevin Costner is outstanding in his portrayal of Mr. Brooks, a seemingly solid citizen and nice guy with a seriously evil and twisted side to him. The whole fractured psyche shown, with the invention of an imaginary alter ego that pushes him to commit atrocious murders, looks like a very true-to-life scenario of a split personality, the classic Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde syndrome. The depiction of how the tension and frustration and excitement build in between the kills, till the killer trips and bursts through the nice guy persona is chilling and effective. However, even though I found the whole genetic basis of twisted psychopathic behavior to be an exceedingly intriguing premise, I am not so sure about a killing gene expressing itself so floridly, especially in a female, as female serial killers are so far and few in between in history and most could not be related back to a genetic basis. Still, this is one good, scary and original take on the whole serial killer genre. Watch it!!",Mr. Brooks
180,zivsoondie,unfortunately it's missing something,4,24 November 2016,"I'd say this film is a bit less than average. It has some twists that I liked, and Mr.Brooks have you think about how randomly someone gets killed. You have your plans, your day ahead but, no, suddenly you're dead. Kevin Costner does a decent job, and his calm demeanor somehow fits the role. His killer alter ego is played by William Hurt, and that works well. It made me think of how the Ego plays tricks on us; the devil on everyone's shoulder... Demi Moore's character is a bit flat, while Dane Cook is OK. I am left with the feeling that this movie could have been a lot better, but unfortunately it's missing something. I don't regret watching it, though.",Mr. Brooks
181,philipposathina,Not bad at all!!,7,9 January 2012,"It had been some time now, before i watched again a film that really ""absorbed"" me in its universe. And that was ""Mr Brooks"". I am not sure whether the story is the most ""original"" i have ever seen on screen, but i can say for certain that it never made me think it would try any convenient and easy solutions in the plot neither that it didn't seriously mean to make me wonder which twist was to come up next. I trusted it from its very first scene, and yes, it payed my trust back. I can assure you that i am not the easiest film viewer, on the contrary, i can not stand films which do not really mean to deeply intrigue me,so i immediately turn them down if i find out that they do not mean to tell a story based on a realistic flow and not on arbitrary events which are not 100% based on the facts which make the story develop! And this film really met all these requirements. The only thing that i still cannot figure out, is the connection of the serial killer who was after the detective with the rest of the events and characters, the story itself.If this part was missing the main story wouldn't be affected at all! (or am a missing something here?). Nevertheless, ""Mr Brook"" was a film i strongly recommend: Great script, quick and eloquent direction, and very convincing acting ( Kevin Kostner is great here!)",Mr. Brooks

The soudtrack is really good especially the end when his daughter kills him which was a great fxcking plot twist and there is several in the movie.

183,The_Matrix_Rocks,The Unexpectedly Good Mr. Brooks,7,12 April 2008,"A stunning, taut thriller recounting an excellent story, very well told.This movie is best experienced without any pre-reading and as little awareness of the plot as possible.Kevin Costner turns in a controlled performance of a character who is all about control. He is matched every step of the way by William Hurt, who is excellent as the dark side of the eponymous character.A lot has been said about Costner and Hurt playing the opposite sides of Mr. Brooks, but it is Costner who is the full definition of the man, and Hurt is simply there to amplify his underlying psychosis. Mr. Brooks, it seems, is very, very sick.In a delicious play on the plot point about split personality, he is pursued by two antagonists with two very different motives, one good and one evil.And as the drama unfolds, the most interesting question that will captivate the viewer is not only whether Mr. Brooks finds redemption, but whether he does so by yielding to his dark side, or by walking towards the light.",Mr. Brooks
184,Tim851,"Good, with some minor weaknesses",6,20 October 2007,"Okay, so the premise of the serial killer with a twist isn't exactly news and occasionally the movie reminded me of 'American Psycho', but it's surprisingly entertaining. Kevin COstner puts in a nice performance and I liked how his character was developed. William Hurt didn't get a lot of wiggle room, but he was still more than adequate. Their relationship was the salt in the soup.The biggest weakness of the movie is Demi Moore. Her performance is underwhelming as usual, but it's also her character who makes no sense. So she's this millionaire detective, smooth as Sonny Crockett, encircled in a divorce battle that was totally worthless for the sake of the movie. She is also feature in the most ridiculous scene of the movie, a wild shootout in a hotel hallway/stairwell.The ending's first twist was pretty predictable and a little lame, but then they managed to even lower that assessment by putting in a second twist and boy is that the most overused twist in celluloid history.And if I add and subtract all these things, it's sadly no more than a 6: an above average thriller.",Mr. Brooks
185,imajestr,"Has flaws, but overall very entertaining",6,25 February 2008,"It took a good fifteen to twenty minutes for me to actually start liking this film, but once I got to that point I was able to forgive its flaws and go along for the remainder of the ride. I wasn't let down in the end.At first I was turned off by the hokeyness, for lack of a better word, of the setup. A serial killer with an imaginary friend who tells him to kill people. We've seen it before. The characters aren't all that interesting at first, and Dane Cook's presence and position within the plot seems completely unjustified and unrealistic. Still, if you can get over these problems, you find that there's something deeper at the heart of the film. There are some very moving and disturbing moments, especially between Brooks and his alter ego, and the characters eventually take interesting shape.There are some things that still don't sit well with me-- the subplot with Demi Moore's character and the recently escaped serial killer that's vowed to get her, for example, is cringe-worthy. At times it seems like the writers just pulled this out of thin air to add a little more action to the story, but it never seems to fit right within it. Overall, though, Costner pulls off a deeply disturbed man that becomes mesmerizing in his bizarreness. This is where the strength of the movie lies-- in the tormented head of the main character, and luckily for the shoddy parts of the film, that character is interesting enough to make it enjoyable.Six out of ten because of the sometimes ""hokey"" writing, and for Dane Cook's ridiculous character.",Mr. Brooks
186,vicdragon19-1,surprisingly intriguing thriller,8,8 March 2008,"I'm not a big fan of these new sort of serial killer or crime films, but this one certainly has a lot of charm (though creepy) that drives the plot and characters into interesting depths. Kevin Costner plays tormented Mr Brooks, a successful business man in the eyes of the world, but actually a serial killer who hasn't killed for a long time. He has William Hurt on his conscience as a reminder of his crimes - yet no one can see him except Brooks. Demi Moore, playing detective Tracy Atwood is out to get him after another murder happens which Brooks committed, while also dealing with an escaped criminal after her and dealing with her money squeezing two timing ex husband.All characters are well developed, with Dane Cook having a somewhat weird role as a man who wants to kill someone for no reason, asking Mr Brooks to help him. Its good to see Demi Moore in a convincing role and one that doens't rely on her body or sex appeal which she always seems to sell in most of her films (Striptease,Full Throttle anyone? -horrific films). Her role is actually very well thought of and her performance is very good. While there are too many subplots that entangle about four stories altogether, this kept me involved from beginning to end. Costner's performance is also chilling, as he shows a side to his addiction with almost craziness and coldness, while also giving the impressin to everyone of an overworked business man. I loved the music score as well.For those who love thrillers, this is one for you.",Mr. Brooks

188,fredtee,A Primer on How to get Away with Murder,8,5 January 2018,"Very, very entertaining.A primer on how to commit a murder and get away with it...with meticulous planning and execution.Mr Brooks uses the vacuum cleaner in the house where he commits the murder. And a plastic bag to collect the gunpowder. He also removes the bullets from his victims.Also a primer on how to blackmail should you witness and have evidence of a murder.Killing with an axe, guns, a shovel, a pair of sciccors; its all here. All in good spirit, all in ""fun.""Kevin Costner's acting is the very best he's done; he is so convincing that I now suspect a few suave and debonair people I know from my personal life to be serial killers.I even like Demi Moore as the cop with the great hunches and the world's fastest reflexes, but always a few steps behind Mr. Brooks' murders. Worth $60 million with a father who thought she should have been born a son. You'd figure she can afford a sex change operation. Is that why she only wears pants, never a skirt to show off her legs?Then there is Mr. Brooks' daughter. He loves her enough to kill for her, she loves him enough to kill him. Now, there is a REAL dynamic duo.

After all his meticulous cleanup, why would the killer now leave urine at the crime scene??Mr Smith gets caught with his gun whose firing pin has been disabled by Mr. Brooks. Would you not figure Mr. Smith might have checked his gun prior to leaving his apartment, recognizing who he is dealing with?

189,Awakening124,Too many things holding this great idea back,6,5 August 2007,"I saw Mr. Brooks at the dollar theater (it was weekend so it was a whole $2 for one ticket) and the movie was worth about that much. It tried to be a family drama, a thriller, and a dark comedy all at the same time, and due to the Director's lack of vision and talent, it came out as a big mess, with dramatic parts being funny and funny parts being dramatic, and several unintentionally funny moments.Dane Cook really surprised me, especially since the material he was working definitely wasn't the best. He's a great comedian, but I was a bit skeptic going into the theater for obvious reasons. He turns out a pretty decent performance, and really makes me wonder what he could do with a really great character as opposed to a severely underdeveloped one.Kevin Costner's role should've been given to a more capable actor. There's not one scene he has that's even remotely convincing, partly due to the poor script and partly due to Costner's lack of ability.Demi Moore's character is completely and entirely unnecessary to anything in the movie. There is no reason for her what so ever.I saw this for $2 and that's about what its worth. I wish I'd just waited for it to come out on DVD so I could only watch the Dane Cook scenes (something I never thought I'd say and mean).",Mr. Brooks
190,andymcneill75,Good Stuff! Costner on top form!,8,19 May 2009,"Really enjoyed this film and have to say i was quite surprised and this is definitely one of the best serial killer films in many a year. It's hard to believe how good Kevin Costner made a screen psycho and William Hurt was superb as his alter ego Marshall. Dane Cook was very good too as the snooping witness who wants more than you might expect, he fitted this role pretty well and could be a star to look out for, so long as he gets the parts. Demi Moore was also on good form as the cop on the trail of ' The Thumbprint Killer' and on her toes as another serial killer that she put away called ' The Hangman' has escaped from prison. The film twists and turns, has a sharp script with some laughs, well directed by Bruce.A.Evans and finds something different round every corner. All in all a very enjoyable film with lots of surprises, great performances and a superb score by Ramin Djawidi (Prison Break). Credit must go to Costner for giving one of his best performances and just great fun seeing him interact with William Hurt! Can't wait for the sequel!!",Mr. Brooks
191,TJ1380,"A bit contrived, but worth watching for the lead performers",7,28 October 2007,"Earl Brooks seems to have everything a person could ever want in his life. He's incredibly wealthy, he runs a successful business, he has a seemingly wonderful family, and he has just been named Man of the Year for his business ventures and humanitarian efforts. Unfortunately, he's also addicted to killing people. He's a serial killer known as the ""thumb print killer"" (named for the thumb prints of his victims that he leaves in their own blood). He wants to stop killing people, but his addiction and his id (personified in his mind by an imaginary friend named Marshall) prevent him from doing that. After two years of fighting his urges, Mr. Brooks gives in and kills again. Although he has been careful about covering his tracks before, this time someone has witnessed his crime: a wannabe killer who calls himself Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith has photos of the murder, and if Mr. Brooks doesn't agree to take him along on his next kill the photos go to the police.Basically, what we have here is a movie about a serial killer told from the killer's point of view. It's an interesting concept, and one that works very well thanks to the character of Mr. Brooks. Although Mr. Brooks is a cunning and brilliant serial killer, it's clear that for the most part he does not want to be. His desire to never kill again is totally believable, and he is just as horrified by his actions as everyone else is. At the same time he also comes off as very sinister, especially when he is in full serial killer mode and is plotting someone else's death. He comes off as genuinely scary and sympathetic at the same time, which is not an easy thing to pull off. Of course, this is all helped by the fact that Kevin Costner's performance as Mr. Brooks is one of his best in years. He goes from being a benevolent businessman to a loving husband and father to a cold-blooded killer to someone praying for forgiveness almost constantly throughout the movie, and it's all perfectly believable. As good as Costner is, the real scene stealer turns out to be William Hurt as Marshall. Marshall is the representation of Mr. Brooks' dark side, or the force that drives him to kill. He only appears to Mr. Brooks, and he is the one whispering in his ear telling him to give in to his addiction. Like all good tempters, Marshall is charismatic and sinister at the same time; as much as Mr. Brooks doesn't want to listen to him, it's hard not to. William Hurt plays Marshall not as a sinister devil, but as a friendly companion. Even when he's at his slimiest and most evil it's hard not to like him. Marshall and Mr. Brooks constantly have conversations with each other (within Brooks' own head, of course) about just about everything that happens in the movie. He's Brooks' best friend, and although he should also be his worst enemy it's clear that Mr. Brooks enjoys his company.As long as the movie focuses on Mr. Brooks and Marshall, it does just fine. The only problem here is that there are also way too many subplots to deal with. Not only do we get Mr. Smith as Mr. Brooks' tag along sidekick and wannabe killer (an interesting subplot in itself), but we also spend a lot of time with Demi Moore as the detective trying to catch Mr. Brooks. Seeing her trying to solve the latest thumb print murder is fine, but when the movie focuses on her divorce or her problems with catching another serial killer it just gets bogged down and contrived. I often felt like I was watching two movies at the same time, and I found myself struggling to see how the two plots are supposed to intersect. There's also some business with Mr. Brooks' daughter that further complicates things, although since that made a much more interesting subplot I can forgive its inclusion.Fortunately, the good definitely outweighs the bad for this movie. Although I definitely could've done without hearing about Demi Moore's divorce, the lead performances of Kevin Costner and William Hurt as well as its fresh take on serial killers make this movie worth seeing.",Mr. Brooks
192,terryraywilliams,Intriguing thriller,10,6 August 2007,"Honestly I saw Mr. Brooks by accident as it was the only film to be showing within the time frame we got to the movie house, it was completely spontaneous although I usually plan things like this. What a pleasant surprise though but I will be honest about it, this suspense thriller got off to a slow start but then began to really take off after which time I was glued to my seat. The script and story line with various twists and turns was super which is obvious while watching the film, why else would such fine actors with track records even get involved?? I haven't seen William Hurt in a while and liked the role he played as well as Dane Cook as the pivotal Mr. Smith. Demi Moore was good no doubt but Kevin Costner was in particularly, exceptional. All characters involved were believable and although dark at times, Mr. Brooks himself was a man of intrigue. The door is wide open for a sequel as this was a fine original film.",Mr. Brooks

I can only speculate that it must have been due to the title, which hardly evokes thoughts of suspense, drama, and serial killers. It's amazing how much a title can help or hurt at the box office and with home video.With that out of the way, I finally watched this movie today, 6 years after its release, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The movie is very unique, and what I really enjoyed was that the movie doesn't play out predictably, as most movies made in the last 10-20 years do. Even when it seems fairly obvious what's going to happen next, the movie throws you a curve ball. About the only thing that I was slightly disappointed about **very slight spoiler alert follows**, is that the writer/director missed a big opportunity with the daughter. They should have waited until very late in the movie to surprise us with daughter's affliction, and then should have revealed her own alter ego talking to her and coaxing her on. **end of slight spoiler alert** I would recommend this movie to anybody that likes dramatic thrillers, unless you outright hate Kevin Costner, who in my opinion does a good job in this role. Dane Cook, who I'm not super crazy about, was certainly cast in an a-typical role for him, but he does surprisingly well in it. The only actors/actresses that I really didn't care for in the movie were Demi Moore and whatever moron played her ex, which was thankfully a very small role. It seems like she's ALWAYS PO'd and angry in the very few roles I have seen her in in the last 20 years. Whether it was ""Disclosure"" with Michael Douglas, ""GI Jane"" with Ed Harris, or ""Striptease"" with Burt Reynolds, the common thread is she plays a tough as nails, PO'd chick with a HUGE chip on her shoulder and something to prove to the entire male species. It's very obvious that those characters come very naturally to her, and require very little acting. I feel very sorry for the men in her life because I'm sure she wears the pants in those relationships.It's sad really, because I grew up as a teenager in the 80's and liked Moore in movies like St. Elmo's Fire, One Crazy Summer, Wisdom, Ghost, and A Few Good Men, but although she still has the body of a 30 year old, her acting career is over in my humble opinion. Fortunately for this movie, Moore's role is relatively minor, and her acting isn't bad enough to ruin anything. I just think they would have been much better served with almost any other actor or actress in that role. Perhaps the Producer or Director owed her a favor, or she did the movie for peanuts to try and get her foot back in the door in Hollywood.Anyway, I give the movie two thumbs up and highly recommend it.",Mr. Brooks
194,Nightopian-Raposa,Interesting (maybe),8,23 April 2020,"Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner) has it all: money, a beautiful family...... And a body count.
Mr. Brooks is secretly a serial killer known as the ""Thumbprint Killer"". For 2 years, however, he has tried to control his murderous urges, which manifest in the form of a man named Marshall (William Hurt), whom only he can see. But after he attempts one last murder, he finds a snag in his plan of hiding it- the couple he killed had a stalker. ""Mr Smith"" (Dane Cook), as he prefers to be called, blackmails Earl into taking him as a protege in his next kill, or else expose him via pictures he took from Smith's apartment. He accepts, but also finds another enemy: Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore), a detective with her own set of problems. What sort of end will these three people's conflict face?Mr. Brooks is not the best thriller i've watched, but it's a very good one. It's suspenseful, and the scenes with Costner and Hurt are intriguing. However, there are a few problems. The casting of Dane Cook was a stupid decision, considering that Cook's infamous Good Luck Chuck came out the same year. And a few of Moore's scenes played out like a typical action cop movie, instead of the psychological thriller that came packaged with the DVD i stole from my dad's parents. Other than that, it's a good watch.It was apparently supposed to be the first in a trilogy, but i don't see how well that would play out.",Mr. Brooks
195,tankjonah,Interesting but a failure all up.,6,23 March 2008,"Successful, respected businessman, Mr Brooks, (Kevin Costner) can't overcome his addiction to murder and is driven by his dark conscience (William Hurt) who encourages him. A detective (Demi Moore) with her own problems is on his tail and Brooks soon finds himself blackmailed by a voyeuristic neighbour (Dane Cook), who witnessed and photographed his most recent murder, and who wants to go along with him on future killings.Interesting addition to the serial killer genre, but ultimately done in by having too much crammed into it in a superficial way. For example, Moore's divorce proceedings seem tacked on and forced and also having her on the tail of a pair of other serial killers, who try to kidnap her at one point, is silly and belongs in another film. Costner's wrestling with his demons never seems too convincing; we ultimately never believe he's going to really stop, or really wants to. There's also the matter of Costner's daughter, home after having quit college and herself a suspect in an on-campus murder. The film flirts with a like father, like daughter scenario, which is too unconvincing and almost ridiculous. Indeed, the final dream sequence where Costner was stabbed in the face by her and dies, is dreadful. The denouement is also a misstep with Costner organising for Cook to have his taste for killing satiated, by actually shooting Costner and leaving him in an, as yet, unused grave. However, it was all a ruse and Cook becomes the next victim. Ultimately although watchable and promising, there's simply too much in this film that isn't convincing.",Mr. Brooks
196,harrishcraig,"Okay, Okay",7,27 November 2020,"Mr Brooks is a good movie with a compelling but somehow broken story lines. It is these breaks that suspend the necessary relentlessness of a great thriller. The film unsuccessfully interweaves five story lines, each bent to fit, however well written yet as a whole distract from the narrative force of the feature. Worth a watch for its interesting premise but slightly misguided in execution.",Mr. Brooks
197,fatmaninatrenchcoat,A VERY pleasant surprise,9,6 June 2007,"I had no real intention of seeing this movie, but was bored and decided to check it out. Surprisingly, it was a pretty good flick. Kevin Costner plays Mr. Brooks, a very successful and seemingly well adjusted man. He is an excellent business man, a wonderful father and husband and all around nice guy. Who also happens to have an alter ego and is addicted to killing people. Costner was great as Mr. Brooks. He played the part to perfection. The nice guy side to the character isn't an act. He is truly a nice man. A caring person, who just happens to have the desire to kill. What I liked about it was they did not overplay the nice guy side. It came off as very genuine and honest. As far as the killer side to his persona, there are no redeemable qualities to the murders. He does not kill bad people. He just picks folks at random and murders them. What makes this movie so good, is it unorthodox take on the serial killer/cop hunting the serial killer genre. There are no stupid games between the two. In fact, Demi Moore and Costner never share screen time. And William Hurt as Marshall, the Alter Ego was great. He really played up the dark comedy angle to perfection. But what really made the movie for me was the Dane Cook story line. He is an amateur photographer who happens to snap a shot of Costner killing a couple. Instead of blackmailing Costner into paying him off, he wants to be taken along on the next killing. He essentially wants to be taught how to be a successful serial killer. And this unique twist is really what makes the movie shine. All in all a well made movie. Well acted, with the exception of one poorly shot shoot out, it was well directed, and it was always methodical about the killings. Mr. Brooks is a very thorough killer, and you truly believe that he would get away with it because he is so damn good about it. While this is by no means a great movie, it is very intelligent and entertaining. I highly recommend it.",Mr. Brooks
198,mrmatt14,Nice alternative to the torture flick du jour,10,23 May 2007,"I saw the trailer for this one, and thought it was an interesting premise, but Costner movies are so hit or miss. He's the LAST person on earth that I'd expect to be playing a serial killer. His demeanor is too gentle and even. WOW was I right, and that's what makes the movie. That slow, gentle, deliberate pace gives it a surreal sense of unease that a lesser actor couldn't match. It is exactly his everyman persona that makes this movie work.In the tone of the movie, I was thrown by Costner's previous work as well. He's best known for somewhat light and under-realized fare. Mr. Brooks is anything but. This is a very, very dark movie, to the point that it's uncomfortable in places.Kudos as well to William Hurt, who isn't known for playing this sort of role either. His character could easily descend into cliché, but it doesn't. He holds the right note, and the chemistry between him and Costner is tangible.Over the top torture/gorefests have been the flavor of the month. Don't get me wrong -- I love High Tension and it's ilk, but it's nice to see a film that doesn't have to go for the visceral reaction to achieve it's tension. This is an assault to the mind, not the eyes, and it's exceptionally well done.",Mr. Brooks
199,okky-1,Seen it all before,4,2 May 2008,"The movie is somewhat of a cliché as we have been there done that in so many other movies. Demi is essentially playing a role identical to that which her ex in real life Bruce Willis has played in any number of past movies...cue ""The Last Boy Scout""...loner hard nose cop, likes to do things own unique way, has an ex spouse who they are constantly doing battle with as a sideline sub plot. The only diff here is that Demi cannot pull it of as I just can't buy Demi as a tough as nails take no prisoners detective.The main plot/storyline/character development is also very familiar...oh wait I know ""SILENCE OF THE LAMBS"". Put a modern twist on it with the main protagonist not quite so into the blood and guts sicko perverted type of killing and hey presto.Seen it all before.Also not noticing the curtains are open in the bedroom before the main killing...are you kidding? In addition to this the script writer/director would have us believe that the person who sees the first killings occur through the window just happens to have a morbid fascination for killing as well and so does not go to the cops. Are their that many sick people in this world? I hope not.",Mr. Brooks
200,btzarevski,"Finally, a true PSYCHOLOGICAL thriller!",10,15 July 2010,"There are many people giving this film 1/10 who just didn't get it! Favorite arguments I have seen are along the lines of ""unlikable victims"" and ""dark characters""...well DUH!!!! Thats the point bright sparks! The movie is meant to show things from Mr. Brooks' perspective. The victims are ""unlikable"" and not developed because to Mr. Brooks, they are nothing more but chapters in his killing spree. He doesn't feel for them and so so the viewer doesn't either and in so doing feels what Mr. Brooks feels; nothing.Dark characters? Well gee, what did you think you were watching Sherlock? It's a psychological thriller; the characters are meant to be dark! I personally loved this movie! Kevin Costner and William Hurt are BRILLIANT together and watching the brilliance and intelligence of not only them as actors but also their characters was outstanding! This movie does a terrific job with suspense and has a bad guy you want to root for and I was particularly pleased that the ending was not clichéd! We finally have a movie with an actual terrific plot and not CGI or senseless slasher flicks!",Mr. Brooks
201,mlevens1,"Haunting, Menacing and Very Funny",8,11 February 2008,"It's a terrific little film. The Oscar-nominated writing team of STAND BY ME put this out; it's a fabulous script, such a different script.The successful Mr. Brooks (Costner) has a secret: every blue moon, he has to kill a stranger. He goes to a local AA chapter, pretending to be a substance abuser, to help him with what he contends is the ""addiction"" of thrill-killing.There are several movies about serial killers, but none done like this. This has fun with its audience and presents Mr. Brooks (when he's not killing) as a pillar of the community, as a loving husband and father, and as a tortured soul. William Hurt as his tortured soul, Marshall, is haunting, menacing and very funny.",Mr. Brooks
202,rdb59,"Ridiculous script, but has its moments",6,21 May 2021,"The script is ridiculously bad written, unlogical sequences.

204,Darkfrog24,Complicated but worth the effort,8,3 June 2007,"If you do not like complicated story lines, then do not watch this movie. The viewer must be able to keep at least three different threads in mind at once in order to understand what's going on. That being said, this is well-written, well-acted and beautifully timed.One of my favorite things about movies is that sometimes they show us different kinds of genius. From Hell, though questionable overall, did this very well, showing us Aberdeen and his literary partner. Shawshank Redemption, which gave us the eloquent Red and silent, patient Andy, did the same thing.Mr. Brooks shows us different kinds of evil: The killer who kills for fun, for the rush, for the challenge, for animal brutality. It shows us the killer with a soul and the killer without a soul. And yet, the amazing: We come to love our evil protagonist. They don't cop out and show him as a victim first; they don't cop out and celebrate his actions; they don't cop out and show him as the lesser evil to something worse. They just show him as what he is--all of what he is--and we love him for it.",Mr. Brooks
205,theedcarol,Costner makes the movie,8,9 June 2007,"Costner's typical roles make him untypical to play Mr. Brooks. Mr. Brooks' standing in the community make him untypical to be the thumbprint killer. Combine this with a good storyline, excellent dialogue between Costner and Hurt and the promise of a prequel or sequel and you have time well spent at the movies. The abrupt ending to this movie left me wanting more. I liked Demi Moore in her role, although a police detective worth more that $60 million seems to be a bit of a stretch. MINOR SPOILER - Also, the force of Moore's ejection from the van and her landing atop the windshield of an adjacent car would have caused more damage than some sutures on her skull. Her hair also seemed to make a miraculous recovery from the stitchwork. Minor inconveniences though, the movie is worth seeing.",Mr. Brooks
206,michaelmunkvold,Middle-of-the-road thriller elevated by good performances,6,1 December 2015,"""Mr. Brooks"" thinks it is darker and edgier than it actually is. Like most films in the serial killer thriller genre, it's a bit lazy, coasting on unlikely plot twists and providing few genuine scares. The filmmakers could have tried a lot harder. There is one thing that sets it apart from the straight-to-DVD slasher fare that chokes the genre, however: top-notch performances from actors who aren't usually known for them.Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner) is a respected business owner and family man. He's also a serial killer who murders couples while they're having sex. (Everybody needs a hobby.) He has abstained from murder for two years, but his homicidal urges creep back up in the form of Marshall (William Hurt), his imaginary, bloodthirsty alter ego. Brooks gives in and commits another murder, only to be caught on film by a peeping tom named ""Mr. Smith"" (Dane Cook) who blackmails Brooks into making him his ""protegé"". Meanwhile, Detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore) reopens the investigation into Brooks' murders, and the cat and mouse games ensue.All the elements of a serial killer movie are here: the driven but troubled cop, the painstaking attention paid to the killer's M.O., the far-fetched plot twists. It's all here, and it's all a bit predictable. We see a lot of it coming a mile away, and the plot twist that ties the ending together is far too convenient to be believed. The movie is also loaded down with unnecessary subplots: the 45 minutes or so spent on Atwood's divorce and Brooks' troubled daughter (Danielle Panabaker) do nothing but get in the way. Another, small complaint: it's set in Portland, Oregon, but was obviously neither filmed there nor made by people who have been there. As a longtime resident of the City of Roses, I know that the Cup and Saucer is in Southeast, not downtown, and that a high-speed chase on the Ross Island Bridge in the middle of the day is a logistical impossibility. ""Mr. Brooks""' saving grace is the acting. Costner is wonderful as Brooks. Most actors playing serial killers resort to imitating Hannibal Lecter, but Costner plays Brooks as an ordinary man with a darkness inside that he doesn't like; he's a murder addict who desperately wants to get sober. Moore takes the stock ""tough cop"" character and makes her smart, likable and funny, someone we might want to hang out with. Hurt gives his best performance in years as the gleefully malevolent Marshall, relishing murder and mayhem as if it were the best steak he's ever had. Dane Cook is his usual lowbrow, irritating self - which is just right for his character. I don't know if he's doing it on purpose, but he's perfectly convincing as a perverted sleaze. All of these actors have spent most of their careers giving fair-to-middling performances in mediocre movies; here, they give great performances in a fair-to-middling movie. Good as the acting as, however, it's just not enough. The plot is too tired, the direction too uninspired, the story just too dull.In a way, ""Mr. Brooks"" is not to blame for its faults - it simply got to the party too late. The serial killer film genre ran out of steam years ago; after reaching the high-water mark with ""Silence of the Lambs"", it petered out into a steady trickle of pedestrian slasher films. There's nothing left in the well to draw from. Given that the average serial killer movie is so lousy, ""Mr. Brooks"" is not that bad in comparison. While it could have been better, it could easily have been much worse.",Mr. Brooks
207,OBXconsumer,loved Costner/Hurt Duo,10,28 January 2016,"This movie was well done. Seeing Demi Moore play the cop in this picture was a special treat, and combined with Costner/Hurt - this was a very well-acted movie. Although I would have liked to see a more in-depth psychological interaction with Costner/Hurt and his victims and family, it was still good. I thought they are definitely missing a whole scene where Costner takes care of his daughter's business at school though - that was a gap that was disappointing. This movie screams sequel but one has still not been done, although it has been talked about. Every main character in the movie - all good actors - instead of the crappy movies they are putting out by the dozen full of nobodies.

Every ""twist"" in the movie was either broadly telegraphed many scenes before, or was so random there was no way to guess it was coming. It was absolutely preposterous and ree-effing-diculous. It wanted me to believe that you could get someone's license plate number and go on the internet to find all the details of their life, including a line that actually says ""net worth""!! Demi Moore was a detective whose net worth was $60 million, but continued to work for the love of the job. Then there was the meaningless and wasted subplot about the escaped prisoner who was out to kill her. Why? Yet the woman behind me was so overwhelmed by the intrigue, and engrossed by the (arbitrary) plot, she kept exclaiming ""OH NO!"", and ""WOW"", every time some idiot thing would happen. I kept rolling my eyes and wondering whether the movie would end before I fell asleep. Really really terrible.",Mr. Brooks
209,ForVirg,Must see for fans of gripping psychological thrillers,10,9 December 2011,"Mr. Brooks can be very unsettling. Of course, that is one of many factors that make it great. But it also means that this movie is NOT for everyone. However, if you love great writing, awesome acting, unpredictable plot twists and deeply authentic characters, then you must see Mr. Brooks.This is easily Kevin Costner's best role ever, and he tackles it like a true professional -- creating a character that is every bit as complex as any real human.Without exposing too much, I recommend this movie in part because of the disturbing feelings roused by Costner's character -- you want to hate him, but it's impossible to ignore his good traits as well.In addition to stellar performances by nearly all cast members, Mr. Brooks offers discriminating viewers a great story, with robustly authentic characters, and surprises that are difficult, if not impossible, to predict.As a fan of high quality, classic movies, I find few movies that actually do shock me with unexpected twists. This movie did just that, and it did so more than once. It is wonderful to relish such gripping story-telling that is, sadly, all too rare lately.Another rave for the film comes from its lack of gratuitous anything. There IS violence, but its existence is integral to the story and no more. Even better are the scenes that don't exist -- those parts of the story that are told by inference only, allowing the viewer's imagination to fill in the blanks. When well-executed, as it is here, that tactic is so much more effective than anything anyone could ever overtly expose on film.This movie does not disappoint, and it pleases on multiple levels.",Mr. Brooks
210,p-gonzo,Delicious black...comedy?,8,20 June 2007,"It takes Hollywood vets like WiIliam Hurt and Kevin Costner to fill the screen with such rich, nuanced characters - -- and you will be robbing yourself of big screen pleasure if you wait for the DVD. These guys are so good together they have inadvertently formed a new acting team. It should be noted that it is Costner who has really taken the chance here -- for Hurt this was a no-lose situation and an extension of his work in A History of Violence (which is not to take away from how superb he is here.) But Costner was risking looking desperate or failing at re-invention. This film is a true black comedy insofar as it is not really a comedy but the lines and the situations are so exquisitely cruel and deadpan that they become droll and you have to laugh. True the film is saddled with what was likely some executive's decision to push the police angle into Seven-ish territory, but the director is able to keep things reigned in and not lose the main focus.Demi Moore manages (barely) not to embarrass herself although admittedly her role is essentially a thankless jumble of police procedure cliché and gun-toting trailer-fodder.",Mr. Brooks
211,robert-blau,Makes serial killing (and killers) almost nice,8,24 June 2007,"GREAT movie. I had thought it looked interesting, but was genuinely surprised at how good it was. Thoroughly enjoyable, great twists, worth a year's worth of SVUs. Very well done, great cast -- Kevin Costner, William Hurt, Demi Moore, Marg Helgenberger, Lindsay Crouse, and even REIKO AYLESWORTH.Kevin Costner was excellent, succeeding in making a serial killer totally sympathetic (and making you root for him). William Hurt was brilliant, and great chemistry between him and Costner. Demi Moore gave a feisty, captivating, and very effective performance. Everyone else was very good, too.A must-see. The best twisted tale since Hitchcock's ""Psycho"". Totally a pleasure. I'm plotting my next crime as we speak. ""I just wanted you to know.""",Mr. Brooks
212,brentsoffcenter,"Unusual, creative storyline and scripting, exceptionally well done.",9,1 June 2007,"The real star of this drama is the story, and the script. Costner's portrayal of a highly complex, sometimes tortured, character is superb in that he is seemingly always in control, always one step ahead of the challenges. One of the best stories in some time, this one covers all of the bases in a satisfying way, keeping the viewer completely involved from start to finish. There are just enough plot twists, blended seamlessly with just the right amount of predictability, to make this story completely believable, and totally satisfying.Mr. Brooks, Mr. Citizen, is a soft spoken, highly intelligent man of the community, always in control of his job and family, despite the adversities he faces throughout the movie. Very enjoyable is the intricacy, detail, and discipline he is able to maintain throughout the chaos that befalls him throughout the entire plot. His total control of all of the challenges almost makes him a super hero in terms of skill and control in the performance of his self assigned, gruesome tasks at hand. The blending of his alter-ego, bad conscience side, Marshall, is seamlessly accomplished in this psychological escapade, to the point that one almost has to root for ""them"". Marshall, although the psychopathic side of Brooks, is almost likable, in a twisted sort of way. The ongoing dialog between the two is perfect, in that almost everyone can relate to conscience issues at some point in their lives.The added sub-plots concerning detective Demi Moore, the would be wanna be killer Mr. Smith, and the ex-gold digging husband and his attorney, are extra, intriguing elements that are very well done. Though told with a considerable dark tonality because of the theme, one finds himself cheering for Mr. Brooks and his incredible ability as a master craftsman. Ironically, one can also cheer for the detective that is out to capture him.If you are ready for a story that is intriguing, suspenseful, gripping, and present day, then this movie is a good place to start. Costner, Moore, Cook, and Hurt are all splendid. Each one is intense, tormented, fun, and believable in his respective role. Another positive feature about the storyline, and it's conclusion, is that it lends itself to, perhaps, a very interesting sequel potential. Kudos to the directors, producers, and entire cast.",Mr. Brooks
213,drylungvocalmartyr,better than a sleeping pill,3,9 October 2007,"I just simply don't understand the hype about this film. It has no pace, lacks any tension, it's 90 minutes long (at least the version shown in cinemas in Hungary) but feels like two and a half hours. The conversations of Mr. Brooks with his other self kill the otherwise non-existent pace of the movie. The only decent scene could have been the final shooting between Demi Moore's character and the guy called Meeks but in the moment when some tension is introduced at last with gunshots blazing loudly in the hotel corridor our director decides to go silent and lets the score take over. What a let-down. The atmosphere is dark and the actors are okay - these are the good parts but we dissolve into the inevitable dull in the end. When we left the theater with my friend we could not help but smile at the honest criticism of one fellow movie-goer - a guy sound asleep amidst the roar of the end credits...",Mr. Brooks
214,jmaycock,Not impressed,5,19 October 2007,"Okay, first off I went into this film totally raw. Hadn't heard a word about it until right before I went in (over dinner with friends, who had complimentary tickets - thanks A and D) I was told that it was Costner's comeback film. As Pulp fiction was for Travolta. And reading the comments here I think that for many it was. But no, no, no. It's not. Doesn't come close and when the dust settles and we are 2, 3, 5 years down the road - this film will be largely forgotten. Costner was good, but the unbelievable plot let him down. He was also surrounded by wooden performances from Moore and Cook.In Cook's defense he was playing a character that had NO BASIS in reality. However, I can only defend him so far, as he did read the script. I'm sure if I read the book that I could be persuaded that such a person exists in the real world. And maybe they do. But if that is the case they certainly haven't pulled it off in this film. As for Moore? What has happened since the days of her holding her own in a movie with Nicholson? Long gone. Her pivotal moment in the film - swimming.*******************Warning - Spoilers*********************************In saying all that, there are some nice moments, even some great moments. Opening sequence in the car with Costner talking to his alter ego Hurt (who is great) was amazing. I actually thought that he was going to kill his wife then and there, the tension was so great. The first kill we see - brilliant. After that, wobble, wobble, all the way to a great scene at the end when Costner is unexpectedly stabbed in the throat by daughter, only for that great scene to become a dream. Way the go.Overall - disappointing.",Mr. Brooks
215,smickey,The individual drama of addictions,8,6 October 2007,"Mr. Brooks is a very successful business man, well positioned within society, he has a beautiful wife and lives a harmonic familiar life. He lives in a perfect world. The pure incarnation of the Americian Dream: Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness. So, why would a person like him kill people and risk to destroy everything. The answer is quite simple to speak out and at the same time quite difficult to understand: because he is ill. He is an addict, as he well recognizes by himself. Dry for two years, but then suddenly the primordial human instincts prevail. Marshall, who is his addict conscience, the devil who knows everything, is stronger than himself, who just fights with praying the serenity prayer. It is a fight between rationalism and faith, between perfect planning and hope. Like any addict also Mr. Brooks does not like what he does, he just does it. Getting caught would be the relief, but it would mean the end of Marshall. And Marshall definitely wants to survive. Mr. Smith wants to kill for the thrill. He is not addict, he is just a maniac and ends up accordingly. The film covers mainly the personal drama of Mr. Brooks and I was wondering what the wife does, when he is out. She never questions were he is, she never complains that he spends much of his time alone. It seems that he lives his life and she hers. Those who suffer the tragedy of living with an addict person may miss the aspect of the impact on familiar life in the movie. The film also leaves a couple of important question open for the spectator to find the answers. Does Mr. Brooks really want to quit? Personally I don't think so, because although he attends AA meetings he does it because Marshall does not like it and not for himself. Does the last scene represents his wake-up call? Did he touch his ground from where he starts to recover? We don't know that, but it may be possible. This movie is not an easy one, for its difficult subject. However the cast plays it very good. Both Mr. Kostner and William Hurt are perfect in their respective roles and act in a superb way. I just remembered that Ms. Moore was also playing in this movie, when reading other comments. What does she do in this movie? She is definitely not a beauty princess, and acts pretty bad. And her role does not add anything to the movie. Did she pay the get back on screen?",Mr. Brooks
216,strangerdave-2,You will not be disappointed,9,18 November 2009,"More often than not - make that almost always - films billed as ""psychological thrillers"" turn out to be huge letdowns. Either the basic premises are ridiculous, the plots are contrived, or so convoluted that they're almost impossible to make any sense out of, or the characters are mind numbingly one-dimensional. Such is not the case with ""Mr. Brooks"".Kevin Costner stars as Earl Brooks, a successful Oregon businessman who has just been named Chamber of Commerce Man of the Year. But he has a dark, dark, secret addiction that he keeps hidden from everyone except his alter ego, played magnificently by William Hurt. Everyone, that is, until a voyeur (Dane Cook) catches him in the act of gratiying his craving. And the twists and turns the story takes from there, enhanced by the intertwining subplots involving Brooks' daughter (Danielle Panabaker) and the pursuing police detective (Demi Moore) make the story as riveting as anything I've seen in a long, long, time.""Mr. Brooks"" is a cut below ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" and Hitchcock's ""Dial M for Murder"", probably the two best of the genre ever made. But to even be mentioned in the same sentence with two such masterpieces is high praise indeed.",Mr. Brooks

It was gripping and utterly fantastic; Kevin Costner put on a world class performance hands down. He carried this film. In fact, everyone but Demi Moore did a wonderful job and truly deserve a round of applause. This was a fantastic thriller. I really would have given this a much higher rating if they'd axed the police woman. God Almighty, she was awful.Demi Moore destroyed this film and was obviously sleeping with the director to get a part because her acting was a -90/10. A truly horrific performance, terrible delivery and a failed performance from her. I've seen better acting from a nursey Christmas show. The officer's theme was 'I'm the ultimate badass, the untouchable officer. YEAH!' what a cringe fest. In fact, her performance was so atrociously bad it was more disturbing than the murders by far. I'm surprised she didn't get the boot out of Hollywood. Yikes.",Mr. Brooks
218,mjsinclair,A script to die for!,9,19 November 2007,"Every once in a while a script comes along that is just stunning, and this is an example. As the scriptwriter is also the director, then there is no room for misinterpretation in this department either. Make no mistake; this is a slick, polished, professional piece of work. Kevin Costner and William Hurt work wonderfully together, the dialogue is crisp and precise, the direction is fluid, and the characters are well developed and entirely believable.Mr Brooks (Kevin Costner) is a highly respected and successful business man with a secret addiction. He is addicted to murder, and in fact has another life as a renowned serial killer who has gone undiscovered for many years. William Hurt is his dark side personified who incites him to plan and commit another murder after Mr Brooks has been ""on the wagon"" for two years. As fastidiously prepared and executed as always, this time Mr Brooks is observed and is later confronted by his observer. Events then take an unexpected turn.There is nothing to disappoint here. From the first scene to the last, everything works. Mystery, intrigue, and suspense; the ingredients of a good thriller, are here in spades.This is quite simply a very good film made from a very good script.",Mr. Brooks
219,beccabentley,"Disappointing, badly acted and implausible",3,4 January 2017,"I had seen this movie recommended somewhere and was surprised I had never heard of it. I had high hopes especially as there are some good actors in it. However, by the time it finished I was sadly disappointed. Kevin Costner seemed to just be reciting his lines rather than acting most of the time. He was the blandest serial killer I have ever seen. Perhaps he thought that he was being meditative or deep in some way or perhaps he was trying (and falling far short) to be a bit like Christian Bale's character in American psycho. He just came across as wooden. I really didn't see the point of William Hurt. If he had been a bigger contrast with Kevin Costner, then I would have understood him being an outward sign of his inner devil. However, instead of Jekyll and Hyde, you just got Bland and Blander! Because of this, the whole thing did not work for me. Hurt was like a spare and unnecessary part hulking about the place. POTENTIAL SPOILER HERE - And then supposedly finding out that his daughter was also a killer just fell flat. He didn't even have any evidence that she truly was and neither did the viewer. We never saw her alleged kill happen or even see Costner's murder to try and cover it up/provide her with an alibi! And, except for the sequence at the end when she turned on him, she never showed any signs at all of having that kind of psyche herself (and he didn't even challenge her or speak to her about it! Though he was happy to speak to the complete stranger ""Mr Smith"" about what it was like to plan to kill someone!) And then even the sequence at the end was all just a dream!? This spoiled a last twist that I had finally quite liked! His daughter was another character that just came across as slightly bored all the time. I did quite like Demi Moore's character but only because she came across with a bit more spark (which wasn't hard!). And it was just freakish and unbelievable that, not only was Kevin Costner's daughter a would be serial killer, but so was the peeping Tom in the flats across the way that saw Costner commit murder! Wow, this kind of thing was contagious! The writers even inexplicably felt the need to throw in another serial killer called ""The Hangman"" and his psycho girlfriend. The film just lost all plausibility and sense (especially when Demi Moore's serious head wound miraculously healed up without a trace!) I would not recommend it to anyone. If you want to watch Costner in a more recent film that is actually entertaining, watch 3 days to kill.",Mr. Brooks
220,anne07876,Better than expected,9,29 August 2007,"I went on the off chance that this would be an OK film, as I had a Tuesday night to 'kill'. BOY, was I pleasantly surprised! Kevin Costner finally got out of those patriotic do-gooder yuck films where he was always such a hero, and this is a very good change for him. It was such a breath of fresh air to see him acting in a different kind of role, and so well done as well. I have a lot more respect for him now. It is some of the best acting I've seen in a long time in any film, recently.Even Demi Moore was good for a change.Yeah, it must have been the scriptwriters too that must get some credit here, and I for one will be following this scriptwriter in whichever other film he/she/they do.I hope more and more of these types of films appear (or maybe not, otherwise I'd be at the cinema all the time).Well done film. Excellent acting, excellent script, highly recommended.",Mr. Brooks
221,gbraver,Quite suspenseful but not nearly as good as some are claiming,7,24 December 2007,"I don't understand why people rate this move so highly.While the movie is very original and twisted, the subplots just don't add value or fit together. I felt like they were added so the movie could be extended to the 120 min + run time.I wish they could have tied in like Crash, to some extent, or have been less random. These random events destroy the plot line as any sane person has to say what are the odds ... It takes us back to reality, something that a really good thriller should not do. This movie will soon be forgotten and this is a shame because it is original, and in a twisted way we get to empathize or understand Costner. This is not easy to do when you have someone playing the role of a serial .... like Costner does.",Mr. Brooks
222,JoeyGreen,"Funny movie, I peed in my pants, too",10,27 January 2008,"Kevin Costner plays a rich guy who owns a box company and a cemetery is Man of the Year and a serial killer. If that's not enough to pique your interest, Demi Moore plays a cop with $60 million in the bank, but prefers blowing away creeps and getting her name in the papers.Demi's in such good shape that she can actually fly out of a van at 50 miles per hour, hit her back on the windshield of a moving taxi and come away with a few scrapes to her skull. All this after being punched, kneed and gouged by some neanderthal.As for Costner, he looks a lot more wrinkled than his smooth-as sed turn in Dances in Wolves. Exchanging laughs and philosophical musings with his Subconscious, played by William Hurt -- who hasn't had a decent role since Body Heat -- Costner chews up the scenery with a lot of praying, mumbling and assorted tics to try to evoke sympathy for someone who should have been strapped to a gurney in San Quentin years ago for wasting people.The best scene is when Mr. Smith pees in his pants after having declared that he had to take a crap while getting his rocks off watching a couple get whacked. Marquis De Sade would have been proud.This is one of the funniest movies of the year, Go See It!",Mr. Brooks
223,kkkkoooollll,Demi Moore spoils the movie,6,9 January 2008,"I enjoyed most of the film. I really did. It has every little bit of a great cinema a buff can enjoy: great script, which delicately develops a wonderful plot, good directing and camera, and great actors, for the most part. Except for the police woman played by Demi Moore. Her character is utterly pretentious, and hard to believe. I think her presence on the screen kinda ruptures the smooth way the story is going, in a bad way. Big mistake: she doesn't belong to the role and the role does not belong to her. I swear from now on I will never watch any other flick with her participation, for the most part because of her inferior performance in this movie, which has made her character lose all credibility and made us feel like we forcibly watch Striptease for the first time in a row. Other than her, the movie is great, the plot is deliciously sophisticated and the final scene will blow you away.",Mr. Brooks
224,spikerchick013,"Not bad for the time, pretty bad now.",4,20 November 2018,"This movie is more than 10 years old now, so I can't be too harsh on it, but seeing it for the first time in 2018 was just frustrating. Whoever was in charge of the soundtrack for this movie should be publicly shamed. It doesn't fit, it's too grand, more like the soundtrack for a movie of intrigue rather than a film who exposes its main character as a murderer within the first 10-15 minutes. The characters are poorly developed. A serial killer who has been killing for decades wouldn't take on an ""apprentice"", nor would he agree to let someone else come to a killing with him. We're supposed to believe that Mr. Brooks is detail-oriented enough to not leave a trace of evidence behind at a scene of a crime, but he'll bring another person with him? I don't think so. Furthermore, the ""alter ego"" storyline is half-baked, given that the other character, ""Marshall"", is never actually in control. He just talks to Mr. Brooks. All in all, it kind of seems like this was a really good idea for a movie that just was not executed well. I'm perhaps more annoyed than I should be, but after watching films like Split handle the multiple personality angle much more adeptly, I can't help but feel like I wasted $4 in renting this from iTunes.",Mr. Brooks
225,shaffrc,Mix of solid and poor castings,6,21 October 2018,Not to be rude but casting Demi Moore as the detective and that whole subplot seems to have been a major distraction.

It is even harder to believe that a witness, who is supposed to be smart and educated, watches that murder and makes an even more stupid mistake. Nobody is perfect and stories are more realistic if the characters in a movie appear to be ""real"" (and flawed). However, this story appears a bit too much constructed.Nevertheless, the plot develops in some unexpected ways and this saves the movie from being really bad. The acting is good and convincing. However, if the plot gets constructed right in the beginning, this spoils the whole movie.",Mr. Brooks

The only thing I didn't hate about this film was William Hurts 'Marshall' character.They wheeled out the '80s has been Big Guns' for this awful spin on the serial killer vibe - it would have been better if Demi Moore had drowned in Kevins Waterworld.Its hard to imagine that once upon a time Kevin was the apple in Hollywoods eye.",Mr. Brooks
228,Ianmcane,Captivating,8,23 February 2008,"I had no expectations of this movie, but my gosh - what a gem! Barry Evans' psychological thriller sees Kevin Costner going against type a full 180 degrees playing Earl Brooks - surely one of cinema's greatest anti-heroes. It's a slightly alarming realisation, but i have to concede that by the last third of this film i was rooting for the bad guy - endeared to Costner's character and clinging onto the hope that he could recover from his 'addiction' and live a normal life. Of course, Brooks is dangerous and deeply troubled - his portrayal as a brilliant, compulsive and methodical psychopath is expertly performed by Costner - however there is also something unerringly normal about his character too. He is successful, revered by his peers, and has a loving family which brings both familiar joys and domestic troubles. In fact, i can't recall a serial killer movie based around SUCH an ordinary central figure. His explosions of violence are certainly a compulsion, but they are premeditated, meticulously planned, calm and controlled. It's almost as if he's just going about his business in the most professional and efficient way possible; a contract killer who's only bounty is a duty to fulfill his morbid indulgence.All along you know it's wrong though. That's the genius of this movie. That's the sobering cold truth it douses you down with: nobody wants to accept that a serial killer can be a normal human being. Nobody wants to associate with him. Is the crack addict who robs an old lady and leaves her for dead any better? What is the nature of addiction? Whatever the answers, Mr. Brooks is hugely thought-provoking and for that reason alone it's commendable. Throw in superb acting from Costner, his nemesis Detective Atwood (played by Demi Moore) and the rest of the supporting cast, some well-executed action sequences, and an oh-so-satisfying sting in the tail, and you have all the makings of a top thriller.Mr. Brooks gets in your head, permeates your logic bubble and twists your preconceptions. Surely the finest take on the serial killer genre for a long time.8/10",Mr. Brooks

A truly bland and lackluster mix of clichés & improbabilities.I had high hopes for this film but from the first kill I knew I was in for disappointment; nothing about it seemed connected or driven, certainly not enough for a serial killer who is driven to kill in this fashion. Demi Moore is completely unbelievable as the ""tough, hard-nosed detective"". Terrible acting, terrible casting. Kevin Costner is Kevin Costner. He does one thing well and that's be Kevin Costner: you like it or you don't. William Hurt as the alter-ego is fine. Dane Cook is useless; he looks like a tub of overweight, hairy pudding wearing too much makeup and acts like a jittery moron with no sense of propriety, as though his character doesn't comprehend the moment he's occupying. Terrible makeup, terrible acting, terrible writing and terrible casting. The daughter, escaped convict and ex-husband ""b"", ""c"" and ""d"" story lines are useless and distracting; better suited to a TV drama. They mostly serve to try and flesh out the lead characters' lives. They fail.This could actually have been an interesting and clever psychological thriller if it weren't spoiled by what I assume is too many cooks: the need to bank on the star power of poorly-casted, waning and up and coming stars, along with a poorly worked out screenplay and mediocre directing lead to an ultimately disappointing film.",Mr. Brooks
230,hockeyvoodoo,Keven Costner's star shines again!!!,9,1 June 2007,"I saw this movie with high hopes to see a good performance out of Kevin Costner. He didn't disappoint in a movie that very well could have failed--but didn't! I liked the idea of a 'nice-guy with a conscience' serial killer theme, but serial killer movies have been done to death. Costner and the script writers manage to give new life and a refreshing twist on this movie theme, and William Hurt's performance as his evil alter-ego is first-rate. This arrangement was better than just a run-of-the-mill voice-over by Costner's character. It reminded me a bit of a modern-day version of ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,"" which is one of my favorite novels. I'm happy to see all of the actors in this film finally get a good script and story to work with after many disappointments for them and the movie-going public.",Mr. Brooks
231,Wailmer1990,The Perfect Man...The Perfect Killer,9,18 June 2007,"Mr. Brooks is a tense thriller with psychological undercurrents lying beneath the surface. Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner) lives a seemingly normal life. He has a great family, a great business, and is a cornerstone in the Portland, OR community. But nothing is what it seems to be. After being named man of the year by the city, he goes out and shoots a couple in their house. He soon erases every trace of the crime and heads home. The next day, he is approached by a man (Dane Cook in an offbeat role) who has evidence of the crime but wants to learn how Earl kills his victims. At the same time, Earl is being tracked by Detective Atwood (Demi Moore), trying to unravel his puzzling murders. Each of their lives are affected in some way by murder. This film is one of the 'what if's of modern society. Costner shines as Mr. Brooks, bringing a sense of power, nobility, and evil. The only person who can outshine him is William Hurt, who gives a mesmerizing performance as Marshall, the man who drives Costner's impulse to kill. The subplots can be confusing at times, but they come into focus during the final 45 minutes of the film. It delivers suspense and tension in almost unbearable doses, and there is the ultimate plot twist at the end. If you're tired of all the sequels that seem to dominate the theaters and the over-hyped, then Mr. Brooks is the film for you. Be aware, though, as it may be confusing and complicated for some viewers.",Mr. Brooks

He could have just about phoned in this performance. All I could think to myself was ""this script was the best choice he had in 2006""? And the same went for every other actor in this violent fiasco.A terribly violent film that congratulates itself on it's cleverness all the while boring it's audience to sleep. I actually fell asleep. By this stage we've all scene enough gore to last a lifetime at least I have. I really miss the Costner I fell in love with in ""dances with wolves"".

One minute, he is the scary, evil killer. The next minute, he is a lovable husband and father. He will do anything for his family including giving up his life. Dane Cook plays a creepy man who likes to watch. He sort of wants to become Mr. Brook's protégé and at the end, he wants to do it himself. But Mr. Brooks always has a master plan for everything and he fell for it. William Hurt is the imaginary evil part of Mr. Brook. He pushes Mr. Brooks to kill. He is also Mr. Brook's dearest friend, who is there for him for all ups and downs. These main characters all deliver, which makes the movie enjoyable to watch. The suspense is great. The plot of story is so intense and interesting, full of twists and turns. Demi Moore is great, too. She plays the tough, strong cop, who has a lot of flaws in life.

Everyone says, he's perfect.Nonetheless, Mr. Brooks harbors a sinister secret -- he's an insatiable serial killer, so lethally clever that no one has ever suspected him-until now.From Element Films and Relativity Media, in association with Eden Rock Media, comes a Tig Production distributed by MGM Distribution Co., the gripping suspense thriller MR. BROOKS, the story of an otherwise exceptional man divided in two by his unbearable need to kill. Academy Award Winner Kevin Costner stars as the charming, widely admired Mr. Brooks, whose shocking private life is about to unravel. Demi Moore, Dane Cook, (Academy Award Winner) William Hurt, Marg Helgenberger, Ruben Santiago-Hudson, and Danielle Panabaker also star.Earl Brooks (Costner) has it all: a loving wife (Marg Helgenberger) and devoted daughter (Danielle Panabaker), community standing, and his own thriving business. Mr. Brooks, however, lives another life, unknown to anyone else. He is also the notorious serial murderer branded as The Thumbprint Killer. Though recently inactive, his pathological compulsion is inflamed once again by his cunning, wicked alter ego (William Hurt), whom Mr. Brooks faults for his transgressions. But succumbing to one more malevolent urge to murder an unsuspecting couple, Mr. Brooks commits his first mistake--he is observed by a peeping Tom photographer (Dane Cook), who chooses to blackmail him with a bizarre demand. This last crime, though, also unleashes a tenacious detective (Demi Moore) whose own personal crisis drives her furiously to solve the identity of the Thumbprint Killer, putting her on Mr. Brooks' trail.Now, for the first time, Mr. Brooks faces the endgame -- unless he can continue to conceal his shocking secret life, and his true identity forever.The unsettling question of how a charismatic neighbor, business associate and family member can harbor within a cold-blooded killer has long confounded society - and inspired writers and filmmakers to take audiences into darkly fascinating and suspenseful worlds where they've never been before. With MR. BROOKS comes a fresh twist in the tale of how one man can lead a double life of both magnificent success and gruesome crime. Is Mr. Brooks a fantastic guy you'd be proud to call your friend -- or is he a twisted killer you definitely don't want to run into on the wrong dark night? At once seductive and deadly, upstanding and beyond the pale, Mr. Brooks is so compelling and terrifying precisely because he is both.",Mr. Brooks

One almost needs to watch it twice to understand everything that just happened. My biggest issue with the film is that it cheats when trying to trick you about the final outcome, somewhat like the sixth sense did making it appear the Bruce Willis was their therapist. I guess all magic tricks have some slight of hand otherwise I guess it wouldn't be any fun, and there is definitely slight of hand which disappointed me since the film showed so much promise. I believe there was a really good way of handling the end much better, but alas I did not write the screenplay nor was anyone asking me to. Good film none the less, nice to see Demi Moore actuality act again.",Mr. Brooks
236,ajsmacdonaLd,lame,4,12 June 2007,"Lame is the word. What a great idea for a story but sadly, was strung out ridiculously. Kevin Costner is not my favorite actor but not my least favorite either. I found him to be subtle and not overdone in this role. He did very little to impress me. There was so much potential for this story to have an impact but as usual, it seems like the production was rushed and things were skipped over at the expense of its quality. Demi Moore was laughable. As a detective, the conclusions she arrived at in her capacity as detective were reaching and far fetched, almost silly. In her action scenes, flying through the air and sustaining little to no injuries was a gaping hole in the plot. The shoot-out with her nemesis was completely unrealistic and actually threatened the story's credibility. Her performance and purpose in the story, in my opinion, was to draw an audience based on her looks and cosmetic work done. Dane Cook is not even good enough to be categorized as ""B"" list. He's overdone, underdone and nothing in between and never at the appropriate time. The daughter was just okay. She was deceptive and innocent looking all the while knowing she was most likely a murderess. I think the story could have benefited from more detail work done to patch the holes in the plot. There doesn't seem to be enough detail repair when editing is concerned and usually , as a result, the story can crumble quite easily. In a saturated movie market, there needs to be more fine tuning/tweaking. Quality is sacrificed in exchange for quick production.",Mr. Brooks

But in this case I found a very entertaining and exciting thriller in the style of Fatal Attraction. One of the most unbelievable things that happen in the film is that someone wishes to ride along with a serial killer to watch how it's done for a ""thrill"". It's a great story though and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I really liked that the story isn't over and I really hope they make a sequel and let us know what happens next especially with Mr. Brooks' family!

Mr. Brooks however, is not a good movie, it is not bad as well - it a masterpiece. The idea behind it is so brilliant, so fantastically written and then executed by the exceptional performance of Kevin Costner and William Hurt. It is magnificent to watch the two struggle with their own desires and how each one is fighting the other for dominance.I cannot stress enough how rare it is to come up with something unique and then realize it in a great movie. This is so hard to accomplish and we can see how most of the movies today are either about effects or some over the top action without something good (as a conception) behind it.Truly if you have missed this movie, you've missed much.

241,NightOwl0,A trashy thriller with a fascist subtext.,1,16 October 2007,"This movie is the cinematic equivalent of a trashy paperback thriller that you would buy in an airport. Some people might consider that to be a good thing. Frankly I don't read such refuse and I certainly don't want to watch a film inspired by it. I am so tired of the serial killer genre in general. It used to be that we were supposed to be repelled and horrified by these monsters and now we are supposed to cheer for them. Mr. Brooks is obviously the Jason Bourne of serial killers. The audience is encouraged to identify with Mr. Brooks as he toys with his various potential victims while narrowly evading capture at the same time. He is the fascist superman, free to prey on lesser men and women while at the same time enjoying wealth and privilege befitting a captain of industry. Costner was threatening to turn this film into a series. I really hope that does not turn out to be the case, although since the first one flopped there is probably less danger of that now. Is this film considered edgy because it has pay cable levels of sex and violence? You can watch a late night film on Cinemax that is just as entertaining as this one, but with the added benefit of Kevin Costner not being in it. The plot is ridiculous and piles on contrivance after contrivance in an attempt to confuse the audience into being entertained. The periodic sadistic violence in the film comes off like a desperate ploy to shock the audience into submission. I guess we are supposed to find Mr. Brooks to be diabolically clever. All I could think about while watching this garbage is how amazing it is that people were paid to make it. This film represents nothing more than a cold cynical marketing campaign by an obtuse studio for a culturally bankrupt society.

You can cart me away now that Mssrs. Costner, Hurt, Cook and Ms Moore have thoroughly scrambled my sensibilities and fostered in me a grudging respect for a damn serial killer! Not since Hopkins' Lecter has a film succeeded in making you root for such a thoroughly bad person, but moreso than the 'Lambs' this one actually has you LIKING the protagonist! Sick.My fervent hope is that Costner really does have a trilogy and overall story arc to play out, and that they are done with the same skillful direction, stylish acting and, most importantly, technically superb story that this movie had in abundance.

244,shazrahman,Good Movie in spite of Demi Moore,6,14 September 2008,"I really enjoyed this Movie, William Hurt and Kevin Costner had me believing them the whole way. Even as the killing force, I felt a great connection and sympathy for their characters. There was clever argumentative dialog between them and they really had a great chemistry.The only reason I gave this movie 6 points was Demi Moore. She came along as this supercop - who seemed to know everything before it happened. If she was psychic it should have made clear - no detective in real life or imagined has been that good. If you put Columbo with Sherlock Holmes with a Nancy Drew and Angela Lansbury thrown in they wouldn't have been half as insightful as Moore's character. Her know-it-all arrogance and her super tough behavior was laughable. Yes you do Yoga, but you cant fight a prison hardened criminal with your arms tied behind your back. Well at least I cant.It would have been a great movie... oh well...",Mr. Brooks
245,absolutely-fabulous47,Not such a compelling title for a film,7,5 February 2013,"I was blind going into this film. I had no idea what the premise was about leaving my expectation of the feature unknown to me. Quite frankly, the sole purpose for selecting this film from the range before me was because Kevin Costner starred as the film's protagonist. During the first opening moments I grew hesitant and wasn't overly excited about the notion of enduring 2 or so hours of this film, but alas, I always finish a film. After the brutal murder performed by Brooks, the film took off and was gripping from then until the very last scene. I have to mention that the concluding scene when his daughter stabs Brooks to death with large blunt scissors turning out to be only a nightmare, sort of in a morbid sense of my own mentality caused me a short moment of disappointment. In my honest opinion, if this ending was indeed a reality and not his bizarre imagination, it may of left more of an impact on me, and perhaps a great lead into a sequel?? The other minor let down I found with this film was its title. 'Mr Brooks' isn't exactly an eye catching title by anyone's standards and people may simply bypass it because of this and miss out on what this suspenseful thriller has to offer its audience.",Mr. Brooks
246,wmdm2024,"Not bad, but needed more work.",7,3 June 2007,"The story was very interesting and unique. That kept me interested for sure. Also, I thought Costner and Hurt were great, as noted by others I thought Hurt was brilliant at times.The problems - they attempted to cover WAY too much material. At one point there were five separate story lines - there was the main story line of Mr. Brooks and hist struggles, there was Mr. Brooks' daughter and her issues, there was the other escaped killer, there was the detective (Demi Moore) and her on going divorce & work trouble, and there was the photographer who was blackmailing Mr. Brooks. There was simply too much going on here. When watching I thought to myself, there is simply too much going on here to properly resolve every issue. I expected a weak, inter-connected solution and that's exactly what was delivered. I found that disappointing.I also was unconvinced with Demi Moore. I think she did an adequate job in her role, but why use her? Even if Moore had turned in her best performance, she can be nothing more than a distraction. I could never be convinced that she was a cop, she was simply Demi Moore playing a cop. This was huge casting error in my opinion. I don't' seen Moore as a ticket box draw in this role, so what's the point?Also, I thought the interaction between Moore and her supervisor & partner was absolutely terrible. There was no chemistry here and in particular the dialog was horrendous. I found myself laughing out loud with several of the exchanges. And, finally, the shoot-out scene was completely ridiculous and unnecessary.This film simply needed more test screenings. The central story and characters were very interesting and compelling, and well played. However, the story needed to be simplified, and some roles were poorly cast.I did enjoy the movie overall and I was definitely entertained, but this one can wait until rental.",Mr. Brooks
247,mollyjatkinson,Good,6,30 January 2015,"Please be aware there are POSSIBLE SPOILERS below! You have been warned people! :)This is a good movie. The story is good enough and the acting is very good.There are a few big name actors in this and Kevin Costner is great in a part that is not the kind of role he normally plays. He's usually the hero but in this movie although he is still the star of the movie he is much more the anti-hero. He plays a murderer who just enjoys killing random people once in a while. He has been doing it for a long time and is very, very good at it. The other star plays a guy who also wants to be a serial killer and wants to learn from him, so Kevin Costner takes him under his wing.Here be the spoilers!In the end the acting is a bit better than the story which kind of drags and gets a little boring. Costner is great at covering his tracks and everything but once the younger killer learns all the tricks of the trade (or so he thinks) he predictably turns on Costner, who predictably ends up coming out on top.",Mr. Brooks
248,spencerjg,"Costner is great, Cook surprising, Moore terrible.",5,6 December 2018,"Costner plays his part very convincingly, and Dane Cook surprised me with a decent performance in a thriller. However, Moore ruins this movie for me. She flies 20 feet out of a moving fan at 60 mph and lands on top of another car, but don't worry! She got away with just a scratch. Then later on, she's in a gun fight with the same people that tried to kidnap her and it's two against one, firing at her in a tiny hallway, somehow she doesn't get hit once and never runs out of bullets. She's insufferable, and so is his daughter.",Mr. Brooks
249,dpo-6,Good Psychological Thriller,8,31 October 2007,"I give this movie an 8 out of 10 purely for the performance of William Hurt. He proves time and time again that he is so far ahead of so many actors each time he speaks on film. You can easily tell how much fun he was having delivering his lines when they made this movie. Kevin Costner was very good in this movie too, though Demi Moore really was miss-cast in my opinion. She just didn't have me believing she was actually a cop. The movie is basically a film about a successful business man (Costner) and his alter ego (Hurt) who takes part in the act of ""Sport Killing."" He truly wants to stop his sick passion for killing people, but he just can't get over how much he gets off on it. When a photographer (played by Dane Cooke, who is surprisingly great in this role) catches Brooks in the act, he comes to him and tells him he wants in on the next kill. This is a well written movie with plenty of little twists and turns and a few fairly intense moments. I enjoyed it, though it did have some misses, particularly with Moore's character and one coincidence in particular that was just too...Hollywood for me.",Mr. Brooks

252,ethanbyrd,Kevin Costner is back on a roll with Mr Brooks,7,1 August 2018,"This is a great thriller supported by a fantastic cast and a great pace. Mr. Brooks is played by Kevin Costner, and he is a serial killer by night, a popular, intelligent self-righteous man of the community by day. He goes by the name Earl when not in killing mode. To make matters even more complicated Mr. Brooks is a persona arisen by a devil voice within Earl- and he is played(not just voiced but physically portrayed) by William Hurt. In one of his outings Brooks is caught in the act of murder by a photographer and then becomes entangled by the law- mainly one lady played by Demi Moore. With actors of such class there is no reason to doubt that the audiences will be kept captivated- and they are. The cinematography, pacing and direction is excellent, and it is surprising that the director Bruce Evans has only made 2 films including this one.",Mr. Brooks
253,user-4720,"Another super-girl cop, something that doesn't exist",8,17 June 2007,"I'm not a Kevin Costner fan because he usually plays, well, uh, Kevin Costner. He lost me after Bodyguard, but the jury is out after watching Mr. Brooks. Only about ten per cent Costner came through and the remainder was Mr. Brooks. Lots of twists in the plot and the time flys.This flick would have received a ten, except that the popular entertainment media seems intent on pushing women as action figures. There might be a few, but in my year of combat duty in SE Asia and in thirty years as a street cop in a big city, I've yet to see a female do any of the hero stuff only a few men do. Some come close and these women are lesbians (that's not a derogatory statement, just an observation as when my butt is getting kicked, help of any variety is welcome)",Mr. Brooks
254,therockin_rooster,Mr. Brooks is a Pleasant Surprise,6,25 September 2009,"Mr. Brooks actually managed to surprise me with a fairly clever and witty story. I think Kevin Costner's portrayal of his character is not only a refreshing change for the actor, but he performs the role well.Dane Cook also brings us a well acted part, while Demi Moore still can't seem find herself a suitable role, but she wasn't horrible in this as she has been in movies past.The film's main story remains interesting and subjective & Mr. Brooks is a very likable sociopath I must say. His desire to kill and alter ego are very well put together and as a main character, I find that extremely inviting.The overall tone of the film is dark and somewhat menacing but yet, the film also manages to sneak a few laughs in as well. William Hurt's character at first seems to be somewhat of a nuisance for the viewer, but that quickly changes after a few scenes and he becomes an intricate & entertaining part of the storyline.While just about every aspect of the movie is gratifying, the subplot does run a bit shallow. Putting focus on the daughter of Mr. Brooks and what secrets she carries with her was played off as more of a side-note instead of a key storyline.In all, I enjoyed this film and would certainly watch it again. It's undertone of how everyone has a dark secret to protect of some magnitude makes it easy for the viewer to relate and remain intrigued.",Mr. Brooks
255,aourchan,Pretty Good,6,6 August 2008,"For me, this was a pretty solid movie. It had some good acting, a solid plot and a couple of twists along the way to keep you on your toes.Lets start with the acting. Costner does a good job and actually surprised me a bit because I was never a fan of him at all really, but he did a very good job as the serial killer torn between two minds. Dane Cook, when I saw that he was going to be playing a serious character I had my reservations about him, since he has only been in very sub-par movies thus far, but I think that he plays the regular dude that is pretty weird and confused about his life and what he wants pretty well. His character was strange at points and did what I imagine a person in that situation would do for the majority of the movie (which is a rarity for me), so all in all I think Dane does a good job. nothing special but sufficient. The stand out performance and the one that really made the movie for me was William Hurt. His character really makes the movie what it is for me, and I always found myself listening a little bit more when he was on screen. He really did a great job and for being the subconscious or whatever he is he really steals the show. Then Demi Moore and everyone else does a solid job as well, nothing special but nothing bad either.I like the fact that the plot kicks off right away, and the characters are developed along the way instead of having to wait half way through the movie to finally get the main conflict. There were a couple of problems that I had, but nothing too big really. First I hate in TV/movies when cops just walk into houses or apartments or whatever without a warrant or anything and just think that they can just go poking around and looking at everything with their pistol drawn. I don't know too much about the law but I don't think that you can just walk into someones house just because the door is unlocked if you have no warrant and no reason to be entering, this always makes me mad. Second, at first I thought that it was kind of stupid how she gets so suspicious about Cook's character when I don't really think that he does anything to be suspicious about in the first place. She later says to her partner that it is a ""hunch"" and that shes following her gut, which I guess gave me enough to not be too upset about this, but I still think that she is overly suspicious of Dane for no real reason.For a second I thought that the ending was gonna be pretty dumb, but they fixed that when he woke up (I was just waiting for the daughter to do that by the way at that point).All in all I thought it was a pretty good movie and could be worth a watch if you have the time.",Mr. Brooks
256,Tyler_Seymour_Wallach,My Encounter with Mr. Brooks,8,6 June 2007,"From the inconsistent screenplay writers of Stand by Me and Jungle 2 Jungle, Bruce Evans & Raynold Gideon bring a film that will be either loved or hated by many people. The screenplay was interesting to say the least, and will get the audience's attention to see it, even if it's only for the concept. If you haven't heard of it (more people than you'd expect don't know what it is) it's about a man who has a voice in his head that causes him to commit murders. The voice in his head is also very intelligent, so throughout his whole life he hasn't gotten caught. As well as in intriguing plot, there are a few subplots that range from fun to boring, though the boring ones aren't in the film that long. Accompanying the screenplay, is the direction by Bruce Evans, one of the people who wrote the script. Now for once in a thriller/bloody film, the director does something that was unique, and cut a few parts out that you'd expect to be in the film, to make the audience think a little bit more than usual. He also constructed a lot of the scenarios very well, setting the moody, ponderous atmosphere that worked wonders. The cast of the film, work very well together, and basically everyone has at the very least ""decent"" chemistry with one another. Personally, I felt like Danielle Panabaker, was the weakest link in the film, though her role was very small. Also, when I call her the ""weakest link"" that isn't exactly bad, considering everyone else was pretty good. Matt Schulze also has a meaningful, yet very small role in 1 of the better subplots. He plays a killer that is on the loose, that Demi Moore's character had put away, and now he is seeking revenge on her. Ruben Santiago-Hudson plays Moore's partner in the force, in yet another small role. He delivers some of the comedic moments that the film needed, to relieve some of the tension. I thought of him like I did the cop in The 25th Hour, there to be serious, and yet giving some funny moments to the audience. Now onto the bigger roles in the film, in my order of preference. Demi Moore plays Detective Tracy Atwood, the woman that is being hunted by her former arrestee, and while trying to keep alive, she is also looking for the ""Fingerprint Murderer"" (Kevin Costner). She is in the worst subplot of the film, her ""divorce settlements"", which is really boring, but comes to a nice conclusion, and doesn't last THAT long, so all is good. I'd say her role is basically like Jodie Foster's in The Silence of the Lambs, just very lower on the scale in terms of performance, just very similar characters. Dane Cook, surprised me in the film, taking on a dramatic role very well. Executing his emotions very well, as well as giving the audience their fill of his comedic lines, though he didn't have many of them. This year has had a trend of people that were being doubted on their acting abilities, and this year Dane Cook is 1 person who has stopped skeptics in their tracks. Kevin Costner, the star of the film is as powerful as he's been in a long while. Ever since J.F.K he's been performing like the average actor, and up until this film, I thought he was losing his touch. Then out of nowhere, in a film I saw out of boredom, he redeems himself. Playing a confused man, that is always calm, cool, and collected, he brings that subtle demonicness that we have seldom seen lately, which was lovely and refreshing. The person who makes this role complete, is none other than the man with the twisted roles, William Hurt. He is excellent in his supporting role, though there could be an argument that he is co-lead, seeing as whenever Costner is on the screen, 75% of the time so is he. He plays the murderous side of Mr. Brooks, and boy does he do a fabulous job. Some evil-funny scenes, some excellently perpetuated dialog, and just uncanny chemistry with Costner. Like his role in A History of Violence, but much longer, and much better, in my opinion.The technical aspects of the film, like most thrillers are of many varieties. First, the art direction was beautiful. From the gigantic house, and beautiful interior of it, to rugged, cheap motel, it has a great variety of interesting insides. Along with this brash decor, comes with some traditional, yet lovely costume design. Full of street clothes, along with suits, and dresses for formal occasions. Pretty basic stuff, but nonetheless good. Cinematography, an important aspect, technically(if not the most important aspect) is very good in this film, and does a great job at going above and beyond. Instead of some of the bland tracking scenes, the director kept his director of photography busy by tracking in a different style, making scenes that could be considered boring, delightful, due to the camera work. The sound editing in the film is very well done. With intense situations that could cause deafness from overwhelmingness, to bullets being fired with sirens going off in the background, it's all done very well. The make up in the film, when used, is amazing. Blood, wounds, make up for occasions, all really well done, and sets the moods in whatever situation it is used in. The final technical aspect of the film, that is really worth talking about is the score, composed by Ramin Djawadi. While it makes the situations it's used in intense, it also has a tech-no feel to it, that makes it fast paced, and heart racing, as well as making the scene seems like something interesting will rise up. It is used especially well at the end of the film.",Mr. Brooks
257,chrisbaldwin69,Watchable but doesn't work,5,27 April 2019,A reasonable idea and worth a watch if you like Kostner but just felt wrong.

258,Im_Martin_Scorsese,creepy!,10,22 May 2007,"I saw an advanced screening for this movie tonight. I absolutely loved it. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat all night. Kevin Costner is extremely creepy as the villain. He played his character very well. The scariest ""bad guy,"" I have seen in awhile. Demi Moore was great. Everyone in the audience laughed, gasped and cheered at the same time, as if we were on cue. The suspense is held through out the movie. THe amazing part is that the end was not anti-climatic. I was not disappointed in the end. I felt satisfied. The trailer does not do the movie justice. The movie is much better than the trailer indicated. Do not wait for this movie to come out on video. Go see it. Although, I did not have to pay to see this movie, I would have gladly given 10.75 to see it. Enjoy!",Mr. Brooks
259,I-Sense-A-Plot,A Virtuoso Performance! (possible spoiler),9,21 November 2007,"Excellent! After two decades of playing ""the good guy"", Kevin Costner proves he is far more interesting as a baddie.With a Lectoresque silkiness to his voice, Costner makes a convincing serial killer as Mr. Brooks who, despite the murderous, deceitful double-life he leads, manages to come across as a loving trustworthy guy. In fact, Mr. Brooks is so nice, charming and soft-spoken no one suspects him of being a cold blooded serial killer. The audience knows he's a killer, but either by accident, or Kevin Costner's acting, the highly repressed Mr. Brooks is who the audience will root for. Yes, I said it.Ah! Chills are rolling up my spine. William Hurt turns in an excellent performance, and I can't say enough about the movie without giving too much of the plot away. I enjoyed it.Of course there were a few predictable ""twists"" , but then there were plenty of surprises too, balancing the movie nicely. Demi Moore does her best impression of Holly Hunt, and surprisingly, despite her passive acting approach, convinced as a detective whose ""gut"" instinct is borderline occult. The same can be said of Mr. Brooks, a shrewd observer of victim and non-victims alike, gifting him with the ability to scheme and predict what his adversaries will do next.Seems like I've given everything away. Fear not, this summary/review has only scratched the surface of what could have been a convoluted mesh of unrelated story lines. Yes, everything is gift wrapped and tied with a little red bow. And while it lacks a pretentious, grainy, low budget grasp for an Oscar (yes, it's totally mainstream), just remember, Mr. Brooks is a popcorn thriller. If you can appreciate it for what it is, you'll love the movie. If not the movie, you'll not only love seeing William Hurt, but will totally enjoy Kevin Costner's virtuoso performance.Bravo.",Mr. Brooks
260,kari_d,Kevin and William carry this film!,7,12 November 2007,"I wasn't sure if this movie would be that good before I saw it. I'm not a huge Kevin Costner fan. However, I was surprised. Kevin Costner is perfect in this role and William Hurt was awesome. I love their characters and development. I am still thinking about it. The two of them carried this movie and really made it worth seeing.I didn't think the other actors did anything for this movie - maybe it was the poor dialog for everyone else in the film except KC and WH. I was surprised that I didn't even like Demi Moore. She just wasn't very believable at all - but again, it could have been the poor script dialog. Marg was good though, and I think it would have been better had she been cast as the cop instead of the wife - but perhaps that would have been too much like CSI.If my rating was based solely on the performances of Kevin Costner and William Hurt, dialog, acting, plot - I'd give it an 8 or 8.5. They were really fantastic. If my rating was based on the acting/dialog of the others in the film, I'd give it a 6 or 6.5. Truly, the scenes without Kevin Costner and William Hurt just weren't worth anything. Therefore, it gets a 7 as a whole.",Mr. Brooks
261,gelatin25,Pleasantly Surprised,7,4 December 2007,"I didn't expect much considering all the bad reviews (not that those matter) but actually found this to be quite entertaining for the most part. It really plays with your mind, an original psychological thriller compared to most others out there today. Kevin Costner, in an interesting new turn for him, plays Mr. Brooks, a self-made multi-millionaire with a beautiful house and a loving wife and daughter. His business colleagues have nothing but respect for him. But he has a dark secret... he's addicted to killing people and has been for years. He fights his addiction by attending AA meetings at church and just calling himself ""an addict."" William Hurt plays ""Marshall,"" his twisted inner-voice who eggs him on. I found Costner and especially Hurt to be quite a hoot in a very darkly comic sort of way, they actually make quite a duo. The ending could have been worked with better, but overall this was well-done and a must-see for any fans of Costner or Hurt, or any fans of thrillers that actually show a good sense of humor.",Mr. Brooks
262,rizzojr,Horrible...,2,4 November 2007,"I feel as if this movie took 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back. The only consolation is that I rented the title instead of viewing it at the theater thus saving me $10 on popcorn and a drink.The specifics... Kevin Costner plays Earl Brooks, a model citizen in Portland, Oregon who harbors a fixation for murder. Okay, on that premise, it sounds as if we have an interesting script.Now add Dane Cook's Mr. Bafford character in the mix, a peeping tom who witnesses something he wasn't quite expecting one evening. Unfortunately, the audience wasn't expecting his reaction, either. But, even though it's nonsensical, we can still deal with this twist.Then add Demi Moore's Tracy Atwood character, a consumed detective dedicated to catching Mr. Brook at any expense. Also, at the expense of the overall plot, is Detective Atwood's personal life included into the script. Even worse, this ridiculous sub-plot is rendered totally insane when it is revealed that Moore's character is extremely wealthy.At this point the movie is ruined but the writers still insist upon driving their creation into the ground even further by introducing Jane, Earl Brooks' daughter. Jane is a recent college dropout who may have some skeletons in her own closet.In the end, Mr. Brooks trudges along introducing one ridiculous story line after another until we are an hour and a half into it and just waiting for it to wrap up.While Costner was excellent in his role, even he can't save this floater.",Mr. Brooks

The interaction between Mr. Brooks and his alter ego, the doppleganger, was superbly done. I found myself disturbed as the film developed, yet I could not stop watching it. It not only shows the dark side of a seemingly all American man, husband and father, it may also say something about the dark side of ourselves. There were a few people I wanted to see killed, in fact, was almost hoping they would be. Fathers with daughters will understand the lengths a man will go to protect their ""princesses"", even though the result is criminal.

There are a lot of action though. Not killings by Mr. Brooks (when there is killing, it's just an impersonal, bad acted, short scene) but mostly car chases and gun firing by Det. Atwood. But that's not it. The action scenes are lame. In the kidnap scene for instance, laws of physics don't apply. I wouldn't watch this again.",Mr. Brooks
267,nathanialwest,A sociological thriller that sticks to its story,9,28 July 2007,"I usually hate thrillers, at least the ones that have been pumped out recently by the trilogy, but there are more than a few reasons that I would recommend this film. First of all, you get to see Costner and Moore (who, I know, typically bomb, or are casted in crappy films) present a well written script with rounded characters that are both believable and amazing. Also, the ending is done in a way that really, no matter how much of a film buff you are, it can't be fully calculated, and the rising action that takes you to that point is neither overly-prosaic nor predictable. What's more, you get a couple of black-humor laughs that action films and other thrillers can't touch, not to mention Dane Cook doing what he does best, selling the world on the utter abandonment of my generation to any sort of wholly-functional social role.Ultimately, this movie succeeds because the characters relate to each other in an honest way, and while Mr. Brook's heinous addiction to murder is the driving force behind the film, you truly can see it from his eyes, as well as the rest of the world he allows to live in peace. The deaths of certain victims brings into question whether or not street justice has a place in society, how our legal system fails, and best of all, whether or not someone can judge if a person deserves to die. However, these debates never entangle the plot, nor is the film some sort of statement on how society functions; it's a story first, and that's why I liked it.",Mr. Brooks

I saw that Kevin Costner was in it, and figured it would be a light-hearted drama. Then I read that it was suspense, and figured he was a good-guy spy or something. Not so.I don't want to spoil exactly what Mr. Brooks is (even though it's revealed in the early part of the movie), but let's just say he's not a good guy. He is cold, brilliant, methodical, and heartless. Definitely not the traits we normally expect from Kevin Costner. And yet, it's fascinating to watch. I found myself rooting for him, and then had to kick myself because his character is so despicable. Top notch acting from him.Dane Cook seems an odd casting choice for a suspense thriller, and yet he is believable in his role as a cowardly average joe trying to get the better of Mr. Brooks.This movie is surprisingly graphic and brutal in some scenes. Yet it is so engrossing that you will be hooked on every twist and turn (and there are some good ones).Not for the faint of heart, not your normal Costner flick, but a very good movie.",Mr. Brooks

I mean, I usually find myself getting out of the movie's immersion with mistakes, incoherences, lack of mood and clichés.I was skeptical and didn't have high expectations of the movie, even though the IMDb score was high. ( lately I don't trust the score that much either ) First of all, I'm far from being a fan of Kevin Costner, I really don't like most of his movies, and his presence. Secondly, I really don't like Demi Moore. And at the beginning of the movie, I was very afraid to see clichés and incoherences because of the stories focal point and perspective. Turns out this is a really nice movie. Here are the things I like: What I liked the most was the great immersion value, and excellent storytelling. I loved it. It has an excellent pace. Kevin Costner played very very well. Demi Moore wasn't that good, but didn't really have to be. There was no error or incoherence for the casual/enthusiastic watcher. The plot also, had a good balance of surprises/twists & playing to expectations. And it was hard to pull off decently. A very tidy movie with lots of entertainment, to sum it up. The musical score was also very nice and helps with the mood.You definitely won't want your money back, and neither will your dull friend.",Mr. Brooks

My brother said "" I have a great movie you should watch"" My Mom and Dad agreed with him so I took it home and popped it in. I was half asleep and figured I would pass out watchin it. It grabbed my attention, within 3 minutes I knew I would be awake until it was over. This movie could not have had a better cast as each and every one of them made a great contribution to the movies quality. William Hurt deserves some serious credit. His character accented Kevin COstners very very well but without Kevin this move would not have been half as good even with its well written script. His character portrays a serial killer with family values and you find yourself rooting for him as he exibits some what of a good side. Dane Cook has been a favorite of mine since he hit the comedy scene and its nice to see a serious display of talent coming from someone you knew had it in them. Way to go dane!

However, after reading the high rating on this site, I decided to give both him and the movie a chance.I was bitterly disappointed and realized I had been right in the first place; that my hunch was completely right. What a waste of time! I am quite fond of serial killer movies, and their disturbed and disturbing mind is a rather fascinating subject of study.However, this movie failed on several aspects. Apart from miscast Kevin Costner, who does well playing a successful businessman but does not convince as a troubled serial killer, there is the case of Demi Moore who nobody in their right frame of mind would cast as a hard-boiled tough detective. William Hurt is a great actor, but he gives an expressionless performance and half of the time he is eaten up by shadows and we hardly get to see him.Now the script's main failing is that it tries to handle several plot strands and they are so boggled and mismanaged that it all ends up confusing the poor viewer.

Disappointingly, the movie's core genre is actually ""Family Drama"", and thus it fails to excite by the standards of the expected thriller/suspense genre. Regardless of genre, there are too few thrills and too little suspense. The movie tries to compensate through character development, but without enough action, the plot dies. The movie also tries to compensate by being ""artsy"", but in a hackneyed fashion.After a while, I felt like the Dane Cook character, growing impatient as I waited for something more to happen.",Mr. Brooks

276,mk-2222,Seriously twisted but seriously good... I couldn't look away,8,24 November 2007,"When I walked into the cinema I had no idea what Mr. Brooks was about. The enigmatic opening statement only added to my initial confusion, and curiosity. But Mr. Brooks soon proved itself to be a brilliant, compelling, utterly sick and twisted and finely acted psychological thriller.Kevin Costner stars as Mr. Brooks, a schizophrenic and wealthy owner of a box factory who is also the infamous 'Thumbprint killer' (this is revealed early in the movie, so don't worry). He doesn't kill people because he wants to, he kills people because 'he's an addict'.Demi Moore stars as the cop on his trail, and Dane Cook as a part blackmailer, part apprentice to Mr. Brooks.The only problems with this film are the one-dimensional soundtrack, mostly a series of repetitive and utterly sterile artificial noises, and the equally one-dimensional characters, but this isn't a character-driven movie so that can be forgiven.Generally I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind being seriously creeped out, there's only one or two short gory scenes so squeamish people need not worry.8/10",Mr. Brooks
277,jakelamotta06,Serenity Now,5,1 June 2007,"In ""Mr. Brooks"", Kevin Costner gets to indulge in his dark side. Playing against the type as a serial killer, Costner gives the role appropriate nuance and subtly. Paired with his alter-ego, Marshall (William Hurt), they create an entertaining team, as well as an intriguing set-up. Directed by Bruce Evans, this disappointment turns to heavy doses of camp which squander any potential this movie had. The Demi Moore storyline didn't work either, as it alternated between being tedious and laughable (I remember Demi Moore showing up in a Prodigy-inspired music video, complete with strobe effects and pulsating beats). ""Mr. Brooks"" is devoid of tension throughout majority of its length, and features more laughs than thrills. What began as an interesting and promising concept for a psychological thriller quickly turns to an over-plotted circus.",Mr. Brooks
278,dr_games,An excellent balance,9,4 June 2007,"The movie was amazing. I did not expect to enjoy the film. My two eighteen year olds wanted to see it, because they like Dane Cook. The writing was exceptional. The twists and turns were unexpected, and the plot kept you on the edge of your seat. The director accomplished this without excessive gore. Kevin Costner plays Mr. Brooks, the mild mannered business man who is actually a mass murderer. William Hurt plays his alter-ego, but a walking, talking one. The interplay between the two parts of Mr. Brooks was fantastic. You could feel the chemistry between Costner and Hurt (much like Hurt and Raul Julia in their movies together). There is a dream scene at nearly the end of the movie that you are absolutely convinced is real. Demi Moore did a credible job in this movie, but her character was not developed into a central, driving force in the movie. I thought that she might be as Moore's character was the only one that we should have been able to empathize with. All in all, not for the kiddies, but a wild ride and worth seeing on the big screen.",Mr. Brooks
279,dotmrt,Interesting view into the mind of a serial killer,6,23 October 2007,"An intelligent thriller with interesting old-timers and a stand-up comedian. I'm happy they haven't turned it to an action-flick. Kevin Costner is quite an excellent choice for a multiple personality disorder guy, because he has this emotionless face. William Hurt is supposed to play out his emotions I guess, which he does. The movie gets you thinking about the ""guy/girl next door"" and the possibility that ""every killer is somebody's neighbor"". And that is one scary thought to be taken with you from the theater. I would also like to point out the score that accompanies the movie so delicately and adds to the atmosphere. The story is not good for it's twists (there really are none), but because of the psychological aspects. At least the Mr Brooks part of the story. There is also another story told there about Demi Moore's character which is completely waste of screen time. It connects ever so slightly with the main story line, I guess to assure you, that you are still watching the same movie. Demi Moore manages to be incredibly unconvincing detective (and the character is almost undeveloped) who also cannot hold a pistol properly - who really holds their hands straight in front of him/her and tries to shoot like that? And why the shootout scene somehow people are hit many times, but not really hurt as the manage to almost get away. Was it something in the contract forced by Moore, that she wants to be a bitch? In fact I'm quite convinced that Moore and Costner didn't get to be on a scene together because they both have enormous egos and wouldn't have fit on to a screen together. Another underdeveloped character is Mrs Brooks. I don't buy that she doesn't suspect anything. Where is her husband so late at night? Why does her husband have all these plastic bags and even plastic slippers and such. And what does he do in the garage/yard-house late at night? Come on! The lovely CSI redhead is there only for a decoration, she isn't a character in the story, unfortunately. If you edit out the Moore parts of the movie, it might be a real solid study into the psychology, but until then, I'm going to have to give it a 6/10.",Mr. Brooks

The only thing is, I don't think that it's that severe in most cases. I think most just hear voices and don't necessarily see images or people. One thing that really got me was the ending and the beginning were essentially the same, I mean it looked as though that was it for the movie, but as noted in the trivia section of IMDb it's apparently a trilogy. I just hope it doesn't go too far that it turns into a bad storyline. I don't know, we'll see. But overall good movie and surprisingly good acting from Dane Cook.

A previous reviewer commented he loved the way the script got inside the mind of the killer - phooey! We know nothing of this, except that Costner asserts he is an addict, and attends a self help group, lame lame lame. We are also asked to believe his daughter has inherited the 'addiction to murder' gene, another ludicrous device, unsupported by any science I have ever heard of. But the film trots on, rerunning grizzly murder shots etc., which is nice, but then I began to have a nasty feeling that the film was going to end on me without any resolution at all, no catharsis of any kind, just dribbling on and on. Then there was a resolution, of a kind, namely in the murderer's dream that his daughter stabs him with scissors. Dear oh dear, what a pathetic ending.

I then proceeded to kick myself for passing it up, I HAD to buy it!!It was worth the price! Costner's performance is astounding, and spot on with every twist and turn in the plot. You don't find it weird at all that he is playing the type of role this movie requires.. You ask yourself ""Why hasn't he done this before?"" Kevin is complemented very nicely by William Hurt, who plays another key role. William will shock you with some of the things he does, but you'll actually find yourself loving every minute of it!Dane Cook was a pleasant surprise as well. Let's face it, his movies aren't the type that would get you reading reviews. He played his role perfectly and I never found myself asking where the punchline was going to be. Cook worked out great for this movie, nobody else could have done that role as well.Demi... What can I say about Demi?

286,lksun-898-18775,A serial killer that transmogrifies family values,7,21 November 2010,"The sea change that American popular culture has undergone since the beginning of the George W. Bush era is the transmutation from the cynicism of the 1990s to the promotion of heart-warming family values. The former decade was characterized by the ""Sleeping With the Enemy"" genre, and the featuring of the father as the incestuous rapist. At that time, Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger represented the dissenting minority voice. Now, it looks like the latter has become the main current. Almost every movie plot has to add some flavor of family values and devote some footage to father-daughter or father-son affection, from the anti-terrorist yarn ""24"" to Indiana Jones and The Mummy sequels, or even ""Kung Fu Panda,"" not to mention ""John Q,"" ""Pursuit of Happiness"" and ""Night at the Museum."" The movie ""Mr. Brooks"" is no exception, nonetheless it introduces a cognitive dissonance into the encomium of family values. Brooks, a murder-addict, realizes that his pregnant daughter Jane has also committed murder on her college campus and considers letting her go to jail to nip the ""bad seed"" in the bud. Yet, for once not urging on by his evil doppelgänger Marshall, Brooks uses a fake identity, flies to her daughter's campus, and commits a similar murder to make it look like a serial killer is still at large, thereby getting Jane off the hook. For Brooks, killing has become an addiction, but he does not wants to get caught and brings shame to his family, so he concocts a plan to disappear, and it is then that his perverse fan ""Mr. Smith"" is factored in. Brooks explains his plan to Smith, who agrees to kill and bury Brooks to make him disappear. Brooks, however, has a Plan B up his sleeve: At the point of facing death, he realizes that he wants to see his unborn grandchild, and thus turns on his would-be murderer. It is hard to tell whether family values have become so pervasive as to infiltrate the serial killer genre as well or ""Mr. Brooks"" is simply turning family values into black humor.",Mr. Brooks

Hurt cast as his alter ego).For the life of me, I can't fathom why the negative reviewers find it seemingly necessary to denigrate the other actors' performances(Demi Moore, Dane Cook)who were just fine in what they did and as such helped the movie's plot.

But, as the movie goes along, it adds a few twists and turns, such as a pregnant daughter, a suspicious investigator, and Mr. Brooks' own private fan.While the story is good enough, the film is lacking. Fairly dull cinematography, flat dialogue, struggling characters and a boring soundtrack all add up to severely soften the blow that the film should have had. This is not to say that Mr. Brooks is without its moments of genius, which include the scariest gunshot noises I've ever heard, a very inventive shootout, and a harsh stabbing scene married to a mellow song.Still, not even such nuggets of brilliance can save Mr. Brooks from it(him?)self, and the film falls flat; perhaps, in the hands of a more able director, things would have been different, but that is not the case.Overall, while missing the zing of similar and better films (see: American Psycho, Falling Down), Mr. Brooks is worth watching.7/10",Mr. Brooks

It carries some week writing and dull parts of the movie through. The twist with the daughter in the middle is good too. Overall the movie is decent but I think they could have used a lesser know actor to replace Costner and it would have been more interesting. Although, Costner didn't completely ruin this movie as usual. Maybe I am just soft on his character because I enjoyed watching him pawn Dane Cooke with the shovel.I could have gone without Demi Moore too. She added nothing and they could have replaced her with an unknown and it would have been more believable. There was enough to keep you interested in the movie without her. It looked as though someone in casting owed her a favor.It is a 6-7ish movie and William Hurt definitely makes it better.",Mr. Brooks
300,darbea,"Good movie, some unneeded characters",8,26 September 2007,"Always have been a Costner fan, although he has had a few clunkers in the past, so what. Even John Wayne had clunkers (Ghengis Khan?) or something like that.Instead of parroting everyone else's plot summaries, I was focused on the mechanics of the film. Although not as chilling as ""Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer"", or as disturbing as last year's ""Perfume...Serial Killer"" (forget actual title), This movie has its merits. I enjoy seeing actors taking on different roles; it illustrates their versatility. Kevin Costner was just great, William Hurt, as his alter ego, was his usual magnificent self, (will he please win an award sometime soon?) He is always overlooked. He is a critics favorite, yet never seems to be given his due.I'm still trying to figure out why Demi Moore (actually her character) was in the movie. Her entire subplot was distracting, yet, thankfully, the screenplay managed to tie her in towards the end. Demi and Kevin had no screen time together. Odd.My kudos go to Dane Cook. I have recently discovered him about a year ago, through my son, and his stand up work is original and inspiring. I was dying to see how he could pull off this role, since I only saw him in that ""Employee of the month"" movie, which, I thought he carried pretty well. That movie would have been the usual uninspired trash, but his contribution made the film enjoyable. Well, as much as those silly movies can be.I expect to see more of Cooke in the future, I think he's a rising star. Remember, Greg Kinnear has turned out to be a very good actor, moving from his stand up roots. So although everyone was pretty good in this movie, I'm happy for Dane.Good luck, buddy!",Mr. Brooks

They never stand up to the first movie so here I had something simple quick and easy to say but no, I have to write a minimum of 10 lines. So, my apologies you have to read all this (if in fact they actually print it) but I truly thought this movie was so good, as I was watching it, I found myself wanting a sequel and an ending that would hopefully leave the door open to one.

But as the movie goes on, the movie and the story line pulls you in and it is very interesting. All through the movie it builds up and characters start to change. You start to lean toward all these different outcomes and endings. But, i will not give away the ending or any spoilers, i just wanna say that, for sure, you will not expect the ending to this movie. It was a very good and surprising ending and it pretty much makes up the eight out of ten i give this movie. So if you enjoy thrillers and suspense.....i will personally suggest this film to you. Just go out and rent it. I will say this....IT IS WORTH THE MONEY TO SEE THIS MOVIE. You will not regret it...although there is some boring parts....but there has to be in order to build up for the ending. Solid film.....8/10",Mr. Brooks

Great performances all round, even Demi puts in a decent one. The atmosphere created in the film is superb, gets you right in with how Mr brooks thinks and does things. IMHO much better than silence of the lambs.Excellent story which just gets deeper and more edgy as it progresses, lets hope for a sequel or follow on, as not really a sequel just a continuation of the story of Mr Brooks.

It has toooooo many and gruesome mistakes, for instance how do you expect to fire a gun and keep the round inside a bag where your hand is? Guess what, you are going to burn your hand baby!!! not to mention that the plastic bag would melt too. That was so stu.....d that the movie from there on was almost unbearable, even more than founding a piece of plastic inside the corpses's heads from the same plastic bag after the first shoot??? Later on Demmi Moore is kidnapped in a van. Of course that in some scenes the lateral door is open, then closed and then again open it doesn't matter, at least for the filmmaker though. Anyway, she flies off the lateral door after some bizarre fight and she fell on top of a car hitting it with her back, sure hard enough to leave anyone of us simple mortals in a wheelchair for good. But not so for her, who is taken to a hospital and while the doctor is stitching her head, she keeps talking about the case whitout even blinking for pain!!! Really guys, this movie is too much. The best part is about the last 10 seconds when our killer is having a nightmare, that says everything. Absolutely not recommended.",Mr. Brooks

I didn't even know that Mr.Brooks was released till Sep '08. But the moment I watched it, I realized that I missed its beauty for so long. If i were to recommend someone a thriller, Mr.Brooks will definitely make the list. Cheers to Kevin Costner for a great performance besides the romantic type in ""Upside of the Anger"". William Hurt was excellent as the evil guy and his combination with Kevin Costner was really brilliant. And the way Brooks character was carried in terms of being composed yet a deadly evil is really marvelous.I love the ending theme of the movie - Vicious Traditions by The Veils. An awesome song and an awesome ending.",Mr. Brooks

Playing the main character as a warm family man and well respected business man he makes mr Brooks a likable individual. Which makes the fact that he is a serial killer for whom killing is an addiction even more terrifying. The conversations he has with himself are exceedingly well done - especially as his mind generates a viewable image for him to discuss his kills and his future with. The whole cast are spot on. Demi Moore plays her character well and deserves more credit than other reviews here have given her. An excellent film with only one flaw. There is a gun fight towards the films end which feels at odds with the rest of the movie. Other than that this is an amazing film that you should definitely see :-)",Mr. Brooks

It's not that I personally don't like demi moore, although that really doesn't help..... but seriously: What was the point? There's bound to be an antagonist that's hot on the trail of the killer, most of which are law enforcement. But I could care less about her divorce, and I hate how she's being haunted by some rapist or murderer or whomever. I wouldn't hate that plot point to it if it led to mr. Brooks killing him, but no. That's not what happens. If they took off 2/3 of the demi moore scenes and left in more development of Mr. Brooks, and his family, and even dane cook's character for that matter, it would have been much better. dane cook is a douche bag, and that's why I would argue that he was a good choice for ""smith"". Back to demi: She's rich. She doesn't need to be a freaking cop. They explain in the movie, why she chooses to be a cop, but (Spoiler) It's stupid.This in no way is a bad movie, I loved the acting, the cinematography, the torment that Mr. Brooks goes through with his addiction, the sound track; The good parts in the movie, are really good. 6 out of 10 for me.",Mr. Brooks

This is all together whole new concept of serial killer. Mr.Kevin has done excellent job so is director. The best part of the movie was less blood shed , as we know most of the serial killer movies gets dirty all the time. Demi Moore has done excellent job and the way police investigate is very realistic. Although she was not sure about serial killer but her basic instincts about finding out the photographer was brilliantly shown. All together this is good movie with dark humor , nicely scripted story and excellent acting by Kevin and other crew. I would love to see some more movies like this in future.",Mr. Brooks

Mr. Brooks (Costner) is the Man's Man, so much so, he was voted Man of the Year. Perfect in each way, owns a stock company, has a comfortable home, a college bound daughter and a beautiful wife. But, on the other side, his darker side, he is an addict. Not for drugs, gambling or drinking, but for killing. He battles his inner ""child"" if you will, to kick the habit of killing. Unfortunately, he caves and kills again. Now Mr. Smith (Cook) plays an amateur photographer who was able to capture the moment of the killing. He felt a rush, and an insatiable need to kill empowers him to find Brooks and force him into take him on his next kill. Brooks has to deal with pleasing Mr. Smith or his dirty secret comes to life, all the while he tries to soothe developing tensions in his own home involving his daughter at her school.

It will keep your attention for the most part. But that's it. Don't watch it by yourself, because basically it's a crappy movie. Mostly about how great it is to murder people. I would have felt quite dirty about watching this crap, except I was with my ex-girlfriend and we had a few laughs. Not that this movie is funny. It has a couple mildly interesting plot twists, but that's it. It has some really stupid parts, and it has a boring ending.What I'm telling you is true. For the life of me I don't know why this movie has a 7.6 rating. I guess a lot of people like watching twisted, sick movie characters. Even if the plot is weak.

Mr. Brooks: the man who seems to be perfect (great wife and daughter, successful entrepreneur and voted Man of the Year) has one flaw - His struggle with an addiction. And what is that addiction? He's a serial killer. After two years of rehabilitation through an A.A. group, the Thumbprint Killer strikes, only this time he's photographed at the scene of the crime by a young voyeur living in an apartment across the street (played by Dane Cook). A big shocker comes from the scene where Dane Cook confronts Costner, though I won't spoil it for you!This is one movie that I guarantee started as a page-turning script. Asides from the choice to portray Mr. Brook's 'anti-conscience' (played ever so convincingly by William Hurt) as a human that talks constantly to him, though no one else sees or hears, I was blown away with the fact that Dane Cook can act. Congratulations Mr. Cook! This film is an edge of your seat thrill ride with an all-star cast and brilliant twists and turns. Not recommended for younger audiences  it's an intelligent movie for adults with mature themes a child/teen wouldn't understand or appreciate. It's dark, I won't lie, so you probably shouldn't rent this with your hot date, unless you have a really cool hot date!P.S. Stay away from scissors.",Mr. Brooks
314,websurfer52,Believable? Not so much...,6,11 June 2007,"As someone who watches a lot of ""true crime"" television, I went to see ""Mr. Brooks"" with a lot of intrigue. I think my background for watching Forensic Files and Court TV worked against me. While the movie was entertaining, I found it to be unrealistic and unbelievable in many places. Aside from that, there are positive things about it, too.I found Kevin Costner's character was interesting to watch and seeing his personality unfold makes a person stop and think about how many people in life that you admire are really the people you think they are. To say that Mr. Brooks is a complex man is an understatement! Dane Cook did a great job playing Mr. Brooks' apprentice and William Hurt as the ""alter ego,"" Marshall, was one of the best parts of the film.The biggest disappointment of the entire movie, for me, was Demi Moore's character. She managed to pull off super human feats without so much as breaking a sweat, and aside from one scene where she had her head stitched up (not one hair was out of place even as they sewed up the gash!), she seemed infallible.I would recommend seeing Mr. Brooks if you go in with the idea that it is solely a source of entertainment. If you're expecting to see a film that poses real possibilities, and that's important to you, save your money.",Mr. Brooks
315,osyenka,Boy was this a dog!,1,6 January 2008,"This movie is bad. The acting... eh, passable. I guess. It's hard to tell given the ghastly characters the actors were given to animate. The main character is the only one who can be called 3 dimensional, and that's only because his id hangs out in the backseat filling us in. Cheaters. The main character is the only one with half a brain. The writer lets you know repeatedly that he's exceptionally brilliant. The usual cat-and-mouse that is the fun part of a murder mystery is completely absent. The detective has no amazing insights. She has a hunch. Yes, that's the brilliant sleuthing with which the writer has decided will entertain us. The only thing we know about the detective is that she's going through an idiotic divorce, where we're supposed to feel sorry for her for having to give up 1/60th of her networth. That's it. Oh. And there's a vapid ""revelation"" at the end about her life's motivations. Death is never realistic. None of the victims are made to be remotely sympathetic or even human except in the sense of being human-shaped. They're just plot points. The only exceptions are a couple of people we've met just long enough to establish them as Scummy Enough To Kill.In the end there is STILL no one likable. What's more nothing is resolved. In the meantime you've watched several gratuitous deaths and a death scene reminiscent of Paul Reubens's in the original Buffy movie. Whoever wrote this must have been some 22 year old guy wishing he could try out serial killing for a living. And that was the extent of his writing expertise. He (and I assume it's a ""he"") has no experience with grey areas, and no experience with human motivations and complexities that make watching thrillers entertaining. Worst of all, he has no idea of the horror that is murder. Clearly to this writer it's an abstract idea that moves the plot along and provides some gore with which to wash it down. If you're going to do gore, go over the top and make it cartoonish, a la Sin City or any Tarantino. Then we can enjoy it. Mr. Brooks, however fails as a cartoon, and fails as a horror film. That just leaves us with thriller, and this amount of context-less blood is out of place. Chandler described Hammet as ""having taken murder out of the drawing room and dumped it in the alley where it belonged"".

I think there's a lot of missed opportunities here that a director with a stronger vision could have really done something with. It's a great script (I know the director is also a co-writer) and Costner does the most with what he was given, bit it feels a bit flat in some parts that could have really amped up the tension.Overall it's still an excellent movie, though, and worth watching.(Dane Cook is by far the weakest part of this movie, it would have been good to see Zach Braff in the part (he auditioned I believe))",Mr. Brooks

All that said, I was very pleasantly surprised by the flick. Hurt was great. It's nice to see a psycho killer movie that doesn't follow the avant garde comic book style of Tarantino and his legion of artsy-fartsy followers. the moore character is not very satisfying, although I'll not blame her. Perhaps the trilogy idea would be to focus on different characters in later versions, because she is not a very developed character. Costner is wonderful. The alleged plot holes are more nit picky...there are things not explained, but they don't need to be explained...if the haters turned half their criticism on tripe like grindhouse that piece of flabby flatulent garbage wouldn't be in the top freaking 100 films on this site...oh wait, it pretends to be ""art"", so it must be good.

320,Jon Weedon,Highly original take on a serial killer movie,8,25 October 2007,"In this serial killer movie with a difference, Kevin Costner plays Mr Brooks, by day a wealthy and successful businessman and a loving father and husband. At night he is ""The Thumbprint Killer"", a serial killer who murders couples during sex and then leaves a ""his and hers"" thumbprint of the victims as his hallmark.So far, not so different. But what is different is that Mr Brooks is played by two actors who play the two sides of his personality. The second actor is William Hurt, who plays Marshall, his alter ego. The two characters interact with each over, but none of the other characters are privy to this, only the audience.Costner's character is at odds with the serial killer with him, describing it as an ""addiction"" which he longs to control. Hurt's character is the part of him that encourages him to engage in his heinous acts ""You deserve a treat.."" he tells him, just before he commits his first murder in two years.Demi Moore plays Detective Atwood, the cop who has been trying, unsuccessfully, to solve the case of the thumbprint killer for a number of years. There is almost a Lecter/Starling relationship between the two characters that could have been developed further were the story spread over 2 or 3 films.The sub-plots, such as the usually meticulous Brooks being caught on camera at the scene of a crime by a wannabe serial killer, as well as Atwood's divorce resulting in her being suspected of one of the thumbprint killer's crimes, keep the story moving along apace and make this compelling viewing.I'm not really sure about Brooks' daughter developing a taste for murder - generally serial killers are perceived as made, not born - but this too was at least original.Mr Brooks is highly original and entertaining viewing, and definitely not for those who want a brainless slasher movie.",Mr. Brooks

It had a nice little twist at the end and is enjoyable the whole time. Even though it doesn't have the ""one huge moment or thrill"", the movie is very strong from the beginning till the end. The role itself is not likeable, even though you feel some sympathy for him at some point, but that's just because the movie portraits very well the human side of a killer.
Very enjoyable, give it a trie!",Mr. Brooks

I wish I could think of a better word than ""cheesy."" Her character's only contribution to the film was in giving Kevin Costner and Dane Cook two more people to kill. Other than that, her character was nothing more than a time-filler. Dane Cook was okay, but his character was not believable. The plot was simply awful and although I did not see this movie in the theater, I regret having wasted a Netflix rental on it.Because this is not THE worst movie I've ever seen, I reluctantly gave it two stars.",Mr. Brooks

It is a poor TV movie, the composition is poor, the lighting is poor, the plot is average, it is slow and pretentious, it is cringe-worthy and cheesy, it is predictable and shallow, I'd honestly rather watch paint dry then ever see this rubbish again.

My initial thought was that this movie would be a cheesy rip of ""Dexter"" or any other ""Behind the Serial"" type of Movie/Series. Costner gives us an interesting view into the life of an upstanding family man that just happens to be a serial killer on the side. Dane Cook isn't his predictable wacky self, and actually helps round out the film with his twisted comic/perverted view of serial killing. Take every film that you have seen by Costner, Cook and Moore and throw it out the window.

I love movies that make you root for the bad guy and this movie did it in a whole new way altogether. William Hurt's portrayal of Mr. Brooks' inner monologue was brilliant. I loved feeling like you were listening to a serial killer's inner most thoughts, and they make you uncomfortable at times, but you still want this guy to come out on top. I attribute that to Mr. Hurt's performance.Kevin Costner is really a brilliant actor. He is truly skilled. If he choose more roles that challenged him, such as this one, he would be unstoppable.OK so the premise was awesome, Hurt and Costner are in top form...Now for the bad part, Dane Cook, I could do without him in any movie. He showed up and did what he was supposed to, but anyone could have done that and with anyone else, I wouldn't be heavily critiquing their performance because they are a comedian trying to break into acting. He served his purpose though.My biggest problem with this movie was Demi Moore, in the worst role of her career, as a hard-nosed detective who's edgy and relentless cause she's rich but she still chooses to work because she's just so damn good at catching serial killers. Bleh... it was awful. Every time she or (god forbid) her divorce lawyer came on screen, I tuned out, lest I hear one more line that sounds like it's a bunch of 10-year olds writing for adults: Detective Tracy Atwood: (to her ex husband at their divorce hearing) Jesse, you know what would make me feel really safe right now? If you got hit by a truck and died! UGH!! and don't even get me started on the shoot-out scene.. apparently even with never ending bullets and the convenience of being 15 feet away from each other, it's just to damn hard to shoot a cop when she's hiding behind a 8 inch door frame.Everything about her scenes contrasted with the movie's eloquent, sophisticated feel.So I gave it a 6...

I could have watched those two go back and forth for hours. Not that I dislike Dane Cook, but I wasn't surprised that I wasn't impressed by his performance. My only real complaint was that the storyline involving the daughter seemed to be an afterthought, something attached on to move the story to end the way it did. Idunno, her mental issues just came across as silly. Overall the movie was awesome. I like that there was no ambiguity about what a bad person he was.

I feel as if her part and everything around it wasn't necessary for the story, at all. Or did I miss something? Maybe her character will evolve if there will be more movies. I thought that part of the story that surrounds her, feels unnecessary, since it doesen't bring anything to the Mr.Brooks-plot. And why does he care about her at all? Why the sudden interest in her? I can't seem to find a logical connection there. Otherwise, I think the movie was quite mediocre and that Kevin Costner didn't frightened me at all.",Mr. Brooks
330,dutchviking,Great movie. I can't believe I didn't see it sooner.,8,29 March 2008,"This was a surprise! I remember hearing nothing but back critiques when this came out. I have no idea why. This is a well done movie. It was suspenseful, well acted and well made. I know some people have had a problem with Mr Costners previous role choices, but this is very well done for him and all associated cast. There were no roles I had a problem with and no sequences that really annoyed me (which is rare these days it seems). I think some might have a hard time moving past Mr. Costners appearance in this movie, but seriously, I thought the same thing also when I rented it but was amazingly surprised at how well he had done. Cheers to an undervalued movie! Very good; not Oscar good, but very good.",Mr. Brooks
331,rsmit70,Pleasantly Surprised,7,30 October 2007,"I rented this fully anticipating a derivative, unoriginal serial killer movie. What I surprisingly got was a thoughtful film on addiction wrapped in an engaging crime thriller. The best scenes and dialogue involve the interaction between Hurt and Costner. The alter-ego device is something that rarely plays well, but in Mr. Brooks it is a clever manifestation of the inner-dialogue and turmoil that all addicts face. Dane Cook is perfectly cast as an immature, shallow photographer who has a fascination with killing. Again, I was skeptical when I found out Cook had such a prominent role, but in all fairness...he was pretty good. Demi Moore does the best she can with an underwritten and nearly unnecessary role. It almost feels like her storyline was added because the movie would've only been about 90 minutes long without it. Also...near the end of the movie her character is involved in what can generously be called one of the most laughable gunfights in cinematic history. Strobe lights?? Really?? The conclusion is satisfying, but the writers and producers were obviously thinking ""sequel"". For that to happen, MR. BROOKS will need to find a sizable second life on DVD. As a general rule in life, I avoid anything involving Dane Cook. Mr. Brooks, however, is a perfect example that there are exceptions to every rule.",Mr. Brooks
332,sr1006,Very well written but...,7,8 July 2010,"Bruce Evans as a script writer has done a fabulous job. Its engaging with almost no dull moments. Characters are very well defined. Serial killing with twists & meaningful setup around. Portraying Hurt as the Costner's inner-self was abrupt but it is the high point. Some scenes are graphic in nature but are true requirements. Costner & Hurt have done really good if not great. But, the real let downs are the performances of Demi Moore as the tough cop and Dane Crook as Mr. Smith. The casting director should be blamed for this. Overall I still recommend this title. I give this 7/10 what could easily have been 8.5/10 when considering the script.",Mr. Brooks
333,snigz1984,excellent stuff,8,9 March 2012,"i have to say i was really happy with this movie,i liked the premise of this movie and stephen kings the dark half came to mind,the dark half was OK barely,,its not a horror movie first of all,,its a creepy thriller that is everything the dark half wasn't,good performances and tight storyline,there are 1 or 2 subplots going on which all come together in the last 30 mins,,this movie sucks you in from the start and you cant help but wonder whats going to happen next,i thought costner was good but his other half marshall was played brilliantly by william hurt,demi moore is demi moore and i wasn't expecting much from her if im honest but this film is a great watch and im hard to please so 8/10",Mr. Brooks
334,DPAND3746,Terrible coming at me from all directions,3,10 August 2007,"I like to tell people that I don't see bad movies. Truly, if you look at at the films I own and see, I don't see bad movies that often. So when I was roped into seeing this by a couple friends, I wasn't expecting it to be all that bad. Sadly, I couldn't have been farther from the truth.The script was laughable. Literally. My friends and I, (as well as a few others in the theater), found ourselves laughing out loud at how awful some of the lines were. The acting wasn't anything to cheer about. Costner and Hurt were by far the best parts of the movie. Cook and Moore were pitiful. Dane Cook's performance only solidified my opinion that he is one of the most annoying and awful actors in Hollywood. Moore's character had no depth or emotion to it either. The direction also seemed to be scattered and confused. The film progressed from being a comedy, to a drama, to a mental thriller, to a horror film, to a sob story, and everything in between. And not to mention a shoot-out scene that seemed to come straight out of the Matrix, complete with strobe-lights. The direction was just all over the place.Overall, this film thoroughly disappointed me. When the point of a film is to keep an audience member on edge, and that audience member is laughing, you know something is wrong. This was just bad execution. As one of my friends said, the character of Mr. Brooks is not a bad idea. Putting that character into a movie with awful script writing and a bad supporting cast is.",Mr. Brooks
335,CAmovieguy,so damn good,9,13 June 2007,I haven't been to the theatre to see a movie in a long time besides hot fuzz which was awesome...A lot of movies are really terrible nowadays so I kind of got sick of it. I hadn't seen a really good movie in a long time until I had seen Mr. Brooks....I'm serious it's so damn good...The arguing between Hurt and Costner is awesome....great acting....great message...fantastic end scenes....HELLA LOUD GUNSHOTS in the movie....it was ridiculous.anyways go see it. I have to fill up this space with more lines so Im telling you about how the movie was to me. Really speaks about our dark sides in life and what are priorities are. everyone has one even me.,Mr. Brooks
336,swiaam,"By all means, ""Mr. Brookstner"" is a THRILLER movie!",9,3 July 2007,"Sometimes when you watch a movie, you think you know what's going on, or you might predict the end, which eventually why you wouldn't be so thrilled while watching the movie, but with Mr. Brooks, that's not the case (although there are things that I could see before they happened).There's no doubt about it, Kevin Costner is a perfect choice for the movie, when you have an actor that in a way or another identifies with the character, you get the best out of your movie, and I believe that's what Bruce Evans got.After the first quarter of the movie, you'll feel the real thrill, you go into a certain course, you think that you're going somewhere you know, but suddenly the movie takes you to another course, which makes you more thrilled to know what will happen next, then the same thing happens again, until you go nuts and become impatient to know.After the end, I said to myself there must be a sequel, but my only hope - if that's to happen - is that it won't ruin Mr. Brooks.If you love thriller movies, or want to know what a thriller movie is like, take my word and watch it, 120 minutes won't be a waste.",Mr. Brooks

338,juanfranciscohernandez,Impressive performance from Kevin Costner,10,25 March 2020,"I was turned off initially by the casting. I am not a Kevin Costner fan. I am a fan of some of his movies, but his performances generally drag them down. Not in this case - I think this is the best performance of his career.Kevin Costner play a schizophrenic serial killer. His interactions with his alter ego, played by William Hurt, are captivating and there's very good chemistry between them. Demi Moore is probably the weak link in that she overplays the sassy, chip-on-her-shoulder detective chasing Costner, but it's a minor inconvenience at worst.The script and its intertwining stories keep you on edge. There isn't a single minute wasted on this movie.",Mr. Brooks
339,mersedeh_s,Surprising,9,22 June 2007,"It wasn't just an alternative to a boring Saturday night as I expected, but fascinating from the beginning. One of a kind thriller that makes you admire a cold-blooded criminal and that is the scary part. You have to remind yourself that this is not the character you should like and can be inspiring in a bad way for some. The totally different and rather religious side of the character makes it more like a comedy. It could have passed for a psychological movie without the loud & sharp music every now and then, and to me that was the only problem. It is entertaining as a suspense or thriller that contains a unique comic side. I found myself laughing more than worrying. Kevin Costner's look & attitude reminds you of ""Edward Fox"" in ""The day of the Jackal"", but the movie is nowhere near.",Mr. Brooks
340,romerun,"11 out of 10,",10,5 June 2007,"It successfully depicts the funny pathetic madness of Mr. Brooks. What I like in this movie is it is very enjoyable to digest, sometimes it made me laugh, sometimes it made me puzzled, sometimes it did unexpected things. The plot is convincingly reasonable with a few unsolved answers (for the next episodes!?). I don't know why some say another way, maybe they think too much. This is one of the movie that people in my theater clapped their hands in the end, I totally agree with them, it must be one of the best of this year.I would have given it 12 if they replace Demi Moore with someone else, she doesn't look to fit the character.",Mr. Brooks
341,OgyJoe,Mr. Brooks,9,22 May 2007,"The movie is not even out yet, so I am not going to litter this ""review"" with spoilers. You are just going to have to get you lazy butt up out of that computer chair, drive to a theater, and see it yourself. What I can tell you is that the movie is full of plot twists. Some of them are obvious (at least if you watch as many movies as I), and you see them coming a mile away, but others are far more devious. And I can almost guarantee that you will get a ""jump"" at least twice within the course of the movie. Kevin Cosner, Dane Cook, and Demi Moore are all phenomenal in this movie. Even though he's a killer, you still can't help but love Cosner's character. Cook provides the sarcasm and dry wit that we have all come to know him for, without any of it being over the top or out of place. And Moore plays the bad-a$$ ""loose cannon"" cop perfectly. It all leads to an ending that will leave you with a very Neoesque ""Whoa!"" feeling as you leave the theater. I am out of room, so just go see it.",Mr. Brooks

It isn't as suspenseful as I thought it would be, but the dramatics of the story are even better. It's not anything like the serial killer story re-make movies...it's so much better! I will probably see it again in the theater and I will definitely buy it when it comes out! So worth my money!!

That was my feeling when the credits rolled after watching Mr Brooks.William Hurt stars as Kevin Costners alter ego and makes a damn good job at it too. Kevin and William is a great acting couple and makes the movie not having a down moment all through out the movie. Demi Moore , most know as Bruce Willis ex wife , last good movie was probably 1996 ""The Juror"". Demi surprised me in this movie making a really good acting job, not that shes a bad actor but shes made some bad career moves , i don't think anyone wanted to see Striptease or G.I Jane again after watching it.

345,kkk_bear_99,finally...a movie where people have brains...and use them,10,1 September 2007,"First allow me to congratulate the people who worked on this movie, brilliant work, beginning with the writing and ending with the soundtrack. Very well written characters, plot, twist, subplot, also very good acting and directing (the names speak for themselves), very good imaging and editing and pleasant soundtrack. Congratulations, this is definitely a 10.One of the best movies I've seen in a while and I think most people with above average IQs think the same way. I'm not going to spoil it, read the plot line if you want to know what it's about before watching, it has enough information to keep the movie interesting. All I'm going to say it's that it will make you use your brain a little, not everything is explained like 7 year olds need to receive it.It's worth while, trust me. Vote it here if you enjoy it, support the smart movies, and have fun watching! :)",Mr. Brooks
346,pat_anderfl,technical tour de force,10,26 June 2011,"I won't repeat anything here about the plot, but I do want to say a few words about the editing, directing, and acting. Costner's playing two scenes simultaneously as he interacts with the wannabe and the Hurt character -- his subconscious mind? -- is incredibly difficult from a technical standpoint. This dualism is at the very heart of the movie, and he pulls it off, as a master actor. Amazing! Hurt himself is mesmerizing. The gum-chewing is a nice bit of stage business that keeps the viewer focused on him. He also has an unusually mobile face that he can ""wipe clean"" of emotion, so that his facial planes become flat and devoid of feelings...and a bit scary. It takes great directing to evoke this quality of performance from two great actors and, also, great editing to present the performances in their purest form to the viewer. Even Demi Moore, who sometimes comes across as a really fit wooden-like actress, turns in a creditable performance. I remarked to my husband that without promotion, even the best film won't be seen, and that appears to be what happened here. This movie works on many different levels and should be on everyone's ""must see"" list.",Mr. Brooks

Immediately.We wanted to like it, but it just never happened. It's like a bad date, you stay just hoping for a ""happy ending"". This movie never delivered.Somehow the director must have though that if he could just add elements from every other successful movie that his would somehow rise above. It may have fooled the critics, but it did not fool me. It became a montage of failures, one upon another that destroyed the very concept of motive, and left the best intentions scattered and broken on the sticky movie floors.If you see this, that is why I haven't given specific plot points. I want you to judge each plot element with an open mind, and if you are like me, if you really think about it, I'm sure you will come to a similar conclusion.-Ibrakeantelope fiancée ...because she's not that mean.I am.",Mr. Brooks

349,cinewoman,what a clever film,9,27 May 2007,"I wasn't a Costner fan so went in with some skepticism in terms of liking this. I thought this would be the usual run of the mill, typically plotted character vs. his alter ego. It was not. I didn't expect this of an American movie with well known actors.I also would have never known that Dane Clark had done mostly comedy previously as he was excellent as just one of the psychos.This film intertwined several story lines simultaneously and manage to connect them without doing so obviously--as has been done in so many films of late.I was surprised at almost every turn. It was a true roller coaster producing startled reactions from audience members. There are some plot flaws because there are some strings left untied. But-- it was so well done and mostly clever that, who cares!",Mr. Brooks
350,freaktmp,A pathetic attempt,3,26 April 2011,"This looks like it was written by Adaptation's Charlie Kaufman's idiot twin brother, Donald.We count four, yes four serial killers (or would be serial killers), the Kevin Costner character is presented in an almost sympathetic light (you can't have Costner be an actual genuine bad guy after all -- it must be in his contract), many unnecessary subplots remain unresolved, a few things were hastily butchered off the film so some references don't make sense (the pottery stuff etc). I could go one, but it has all been discussed before in great length and detail.Stupidity combined with clichés and amateur hour editing. They must think we are so dumb in Hollywood, they don't even try anymore. Apparently the IMDb score on this turkey proves them right and perpetuates the cycle of intellectually devoid crap like this.We've sure come a long way since Silence of the Lambs and Se7en. Too bad that most if it is a regression.",Mr. Brooks

I can't see any flaw of this movie. If any body find, please let me know. Some movies you just watch them once and no need to watch them again, although they maybe good one. For this one you can watch it again and again, because it is a piece of artwork. I think the existence of marshal is also a special feature of this movie, which symbolizes the evil split of Mr.Brooks. Don't tell me Mr brooks was a military man, and he did have a marshal.....I am not sure this movie is originated from a novel,anybody knows the background please let me know. Although he finished everything perfect, her daughter inherited this killing gene from, I guess that is people call Karma.",Mr. Brooks
352,gacizawesome,right place at the right time,8,22 May 2007,"So they were giving out free screeings at work, and the movie poster looked intriguing enough to give Mr. Costner a chance. Do Costner fans really exist? Well anyway, it was definitely a new role for him, and he didn't even look stupid doing it. No bad accents or anything! I thought the plot was compelling, sometimes predictable, sometimes definitely not. The symbolism of Costner changing persons with the eye-glasses is useful. I noticed windows being all over the place, as if to say appearances can be deceiving and people can act transparent and still hide something. Dane Cook is a surprising good actor... Demi Moore was strong. When Mr. Brooks questioned her at the end, it seemed to parallel Hannibal figuring out Clerice. So much of the story was Mr. Brooks fighting his addiction, so I see no reason they couldn't get another movie with that motivation but branch out to see how his daughter copes with the same problem. Demi's character too I could see continuing to track down Mr. Brooks in a sequel (I believe she suspects they don't have the thumb-print killer yet). I'm not sure if all my thoughts about a sequel is a symptom of a movie that lacks something or not.Maybe someone could explain how Mr. Brooks' alter ego was aware of a gun Mr. Smith and still fearful of it when Mr. Brooks had already disabled it. If Mr. Brooks was so well known (that Mr. Smith easily tracked him down), wouldn't his taped conversation identify him as involved? Are the cops really fooled off of Jane's scent by a copy-cat killer? Those were the weak points I felt in the story. The disturbing part of the movie is that killing can be a sport or for an emotional high (I hope no one would become curious after seeing the movie). That and is it really possible to get all that information about people from a license plate?",Mr. Brooks
353,realweel,This movie sucks,3,25 November 2007,"This movie isn't very good. Costner turns in another lackluster performance, and Dane Cook basically just plays a loser who kills because he has nothing else to do.I'm not strictly opposed to movies with twisted plots, but originality only counts for so much. The movie lacks character development. If the irony of the movie is supposed to be the great All-American father and husband who also happens to be a killer, then more character development showing the contrast would be nice. Costner originally is set up as a good guy who is fighting demons, but he quickly just becomes another serial killer. The contrast is not very well developed.",Mr. Brooks
354,jake_howry,Most under-appreciated film of the year,9,23 December 2007,"I didn't remember hearing anything about this film when it first came out other than Dane Cook was in a serious film. I think that's what happened with a lot of people and why the film only made a profit of $8 million. Its a twisted take on the serial killer genre that really raises the bar for me. The plot suffers a little from the fact that it was planned as a trilogy so many character arcs are left unfinished but that doesn't make much of a difference to the amazing script. The whole idea is very darkly dreaming dexter, you know the serial killer with a heart, killing is an addiction, etc and so forth. William Hurt's character steals the whole film for me. I think it was a good call to make him more of Mr. Brooks conscience than some kind of alter ego, Mr. Hyde deal. One of the main criticisms I heard of the plot was that it was hard to follow because of the way it branched off, which I don't consider a problem at all. Demi Moore's character doesn't have enough background given in the film to justify many of the character traits which is part of what keeps you watching...well Demi Moore. Mr. Brook's daughter possibly being a killer came out of left field, I mean I guessed the end of The Usual Suspects an hour into the film. The idea that she's only visiting to kill her father's pretty creepy. Could have done without the dream murder where she kills him with the scissors though. They should have just ended with Demi Moore walking past the broken cell phone. Mr. Brook's and Marshall have a complex relationship and are two of the best character I've seen in an original film this year. I hope that the DVD does better than the film did at the box office so that the writers can justify a sequel and finish the story.",Mr. Brooks
355,kentbrowning,Costner truly was Mr. Brooks,10,3 July 2007,"Mr. Brooks made my personal ""top 10 movies of all time"" list. It was very craftily done. Very unpredictable and very original - which is hard to accomplish now-a-days. Kevin Costner played his role perfect with a calm demeanor and a wicked sense of humour. From beginning to end he truly was Mr. Brooks. William Hurt added the extra flare. We can see the dark side of Mr. Brooks though Hurt. Hurt was amazing. Dane Cook was solid. Although he is known for comedy, he played his role as Mr. Smith with ease - very natural. Danielle Panabaker was refreshing. I hope to see more interaction between Detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore) and Mr. Brooks in the sequel. And I truly hope there will be a sequel! There is so much more to this story that can be told. The last note to make is the music - dark and powerful - appropriate choices. I love the theme song.",Mr. Brooks
356,jvandiejie,Brilliant,9,1 June 2007,"Wow, what a ride! This is a brilliant movie with a brilliant movie couple: Kevin Costner and William Hurt. I'm glad to see some of the ""old"" Kevin back, who I have missed since Dances with Wolves and Perfect World.I'm not going to give away the story, because this is a must-see movie and would take away from the thrill. Just go see it if you love thrillers and suspense.I went to see the movie without having seen any trailers or knowing the story line and I would advise anyone to do the same. It is magnificent to see the various story lines come together in the end.If there will be sequels as hinted, then I hope the suspense won't wear off. But it's likely his daughter will take over from dad...",Mr. Brooks
357,zombiezoo92,Mr. Brooks an unexpected twist...,8,2 June 2007,"I thought Mr. Brooks would be a little something like the illusionist, seeing only the commercials, by it was a very good movie. Mr. Brooks was a psycho and William Hurt was a very good side to Kevin Costner. Danielle Panabaker was a very surprising add to this movie, as Mr. Brooks daughter, who has the same affliction as him. Than we get Dane Cook in the mix and he wants to do what Mr. Brooks does, and take over the 'box' business also.Having Dane Cook in it was a very interesting twist, because he is normally a light and funny guy. But in this movie he is dark and perverted while he is with Mr. Brooks. This movie could have tanked, and is was very unexpected especially with someone like Kein Costner who is normally not this type of guy. Overall it was a very good movie, and I recommend it to anybody who liked Hostel, Texaschainsaw Massacre, or even The Ring. This is not for the faint of heart, and the acting is very heavy. This is a very well done movie, and it is not what I would expect from these actors. I really enjoyed this movie and recommend it to everyone who is not squimish.",Mr. Brooks
358,morriswendell,I liked it!,8,3 June 2007,"I have decided to write a review of this movie because I have read quite a few reviews from critics that were not very kind. Recently I've been to the movies to see films like ""Grindhouse"" and ""Pirates 3"" that were poorly written, with little plot, yet got good reviews, and this one has not. I am beginning to think that film critics are complete fools and not to be listened to.Anyway, Kevin Costner plays Mr. Brooks, a ""reluctant"" serial killer. William Hurt is Marshall, his shadow, who eggs him on and encourages him when Brooks feels guilt. Add to the mix Dane Whatshisface as a loser who wants in on some kills, Demi Moore as a Detective out to catch Brooks, and Brooks's daughter, who seems to have inherited his certain macabre character flaw.If it all sounds like there's too much going on, sometimes this is the case. There is a little bit too much coincidence at work here to have this score a complete bullseye. Demi Moore I felt was miscast, but that is just my opinion. Overall, however, this film is like a tight little watch that really clicks. Each movement flows with precision into the next, and it feels very well crafted without feeling like somebody read too many screen writing books. Kevin Costner at times annoys me, and at times I have really liked him. Though my companion at the screening didn't care for his performance, I felt it worked. He has a certain sense of bland regular guy that gives the character a believability he wouldn't otherwise have if, say, Al Pacino or Robert Deniro were playing the role. The only other actor I think might have worked would be George Clooney. However, paired with William Hurt as his dark, shadow self, the character has more depth and more weirdness. There were times I really felt for Mr. Brooks and wanted him to succeed. No, that's not because I am strange. It's because the movie was well done. This movie kept me interested throughout, and had a different and original take on the serial killer story. Never does Brooks become a savage Hannibal Lectre and speak of Chianti and fava beans. He never has that super evil glare that would cause him to drift into a cartoon cliché. However, the shootout ending with Demi Moore's character was a bit ridiculous. I guess nobody can shoot and hit a target down a narrow hallway.I hope those that might be on the fence about seeing it will give this movie a shot, because it actually tries to tell a multi layered story. It might not succeed on every level, but for most of it to work is good enough for me.",Mr. Brooks
359,songsinmymind,A Good Film,6,4 June 2007,"Let me explain all that was good and bad about this movie the best that i can. Now this movie had a good cast, great acting by Kevin Costner, William Hurt, and Dane Cook (who actually surprised me with his acting), it had a good story, plot, climax, everything, loved the alter ego bit and how they did it, and it had good scenes, but then again it also had many unneeded and pointless scenes, annoying over use of the word addiction, and a ruined ending. One thing that really annoyed me is that they kept saying addicted, stressed addicted, and focused everything on the word addicted, if they hadn't done that the movie would have been a 7 out of 10. Another thing is that the ending was ruined, it would have been a perfect ending for him to die at the hands of his daughter, you cannot believe what i was feeling as that happened, i was ready to give a standing ovation, and then he woke up. Keeping the pointless scenes and annoying over use of the word addiction, but changing the ending would have given the movie an 8, taking out the word addiction would have been a 9, and taking out the pointless scenes would have been a perfect 10. In all it had too many faults, but it was an OK, barely this side of good movie.",Mr. Brooks
360,landersonmj,One of the best movies in a long time,10,7 June 2007,"Kevin Cosner's ""out of character"" role was excellent. The story/plot was very well written. Throughout the movie I'm trying to think how this can possibly end; and the ending is surprising to me! I'd recommend the movie. It's rated R for good reason. But it was not a gross R, more of a mind-play, other than the bloody killings. We see that on TV now. And I might add William Hurt's role made the character of Mr. Brooks more complex. A good spin for the movie. Also, this movie makes you think about serial killers reasons for what they do. A constant choice of good over evil. Will the good prevail? Or will the evil continue to be dominate? Good movie.",Mr. Brooks
361,jgoodman01,"A great movie, entertaining and insightful",10,10 June 2007,"This is a movie that is very entertaining, yet provides insight into an addicted mind as no other I have ever seen. I must pay this movie a very high complement, as I feel it is much along the lines in both writing and performance of that of the Hitchcock movies. The mind of an addict is simple yet complex at the same time. Mr Brooks presents the non-stereotypical addict in that he is a pillar of the community, very successful and respected by his peers and his community. Additionally, he is tormented by his addition, his alter ego and his cravings to act out his addiction. His addiction is played out showing the moments of a high from the acting out, moments of deep grief, anguish and pain as well from his addiction. Kevin Costner captures the essence of the script and gives, in my humble opinion, the best performance of his career. Mr. Smith becomes an unwitting pawn in Mr. Brooks hands, only revealed as another avenue of cat and mouse game Mr Brooks plays as part of his addiction. The clever way (not to approve of it in any way, but cleverness is a part of the addicted mind)in which he manages or ""works"" Mr. Smith to have the chance to act out both with and on Mr Smith is so typical of a deep rooted, lifetime addiction. If you are interested in spending an entertaining and enlightening evening, this movie is definitely a 10+",Mr. Brooks
362,daynoelle,Still Buzzing The Day After!,9,15 June 2007,"It has been a long time since I felt this way about a movie. I had the same feeling after watching Robert De Niro in Cape Fear and Sir Anthony Hopkins in Silence of The Lambs.The mood of the film is very dark and it slowly creeps into you like a gossamer mist. I found myself drawn to Mr. Brooks, (Kevin Costner), due to his fight with his darkness, his internal evil nemesis Marshal, played by William Hurt. He appears to have been able to control his demon for a spell and then collapses back into the darkness to return to his old ways.Killing for Earl Brooks is a form of art. He researches his victims, he gets to know his victims, he is an artist of the macabre.The relationship that Earle has with Marshal is one of the best love/hate relationships that I have seen on screen in a while. Marshal is like the worst best friend that anyone would need, but yet, Earl seems to need him around.Detective Atwood, played by Demi Moore, isn't a complete character in my books. I just couldn't identify with her and as such it was hard to care about her. Her ""drama"" with her divorce was a bit loose and flimsy and almost seemed to out of place.Dane Cook, Mr. Smith, took of his funny man hat and put on a serious role and it worked. This could be Dane Cook's ""Punch Drunk Love"" that makes him an actor...not just a comedian. I was really impressed how they under wrote his character so as to give Dane a bit of latitude to stretch his acting muscles and have a real presence on screen. There was a moment between Earl and Mr. Smith where Mr. Smith flashes this look ...and it was almost like seeing Dane's dark side.Emma Brooks, Marg Helgenberger, was almost like part of the set. She was window dressing.Danielle Panabaker's portrayal of Earl's daughter Jane is chilling. You could tell from her first moments on the screen that something is not quite right with her. The stories she tells her parents about why she left school are like incorrect math answers, the numbers just don't add up. The undercurrents in Jane are almost a carbon copy of those of her father.There is one fantastic twist in the film that almost made me fall of my seat. You will know what I'm talking about if and or when you see this movie.I am thinking that there could be a bit of Oscar buzz about some of the players in this film. Kevin Costner, William Hurt, Danielle Panabaker and Dane Cook all deserve accolades for their performances.This film was well made. The cinematography was fantastic, the editing was smart and tight and the soundtrack was perfectly matched to not only the characters moods, but the mood of the film as a whole.I would highly recommend this film as one of the best thrillers of the year, if not the past few years. The twists, the turns and the characters will pull you into a movie that allows you to feel, if only for a moment, the rush of the kill.",Mr. Brooks
363,Dobitz,Mr. Brooks is one of the greatest films I have seen for long time,9,1 July 2007,I think that this movie is not to be judged by it's trailer. If the movie was like the trailer it would have been disappointing. The first part of the movie is quite calm and with no so much action.The second part is a lot more tensing and with lots of action.I think that a movie should be judged great if it makes you think a lot about it after you see it and it made me feel that way.The movie is very original and i have'nt seen much movies like this. the chemistry and playing of William Hurt and Kevin Costner is very real and neat. The only disappointing thing about this movie is Demi Moore's playing and how she beats a bully in some lousy punches and kicking.I think that you should go to this movie URGENTLLY only if you're not a writer about Demi Moore's acting in vary films...,Mr. Brooks
364,dinzole,Excellent,8,18 November 2007,"This film was very good. I have always liked Costner, and this is a change for him - as a serial killer. It is scary how calculated and yet twisted he is with his alter ego Marshall always at his side. The characters are well done, and suspense is great. Some scenes are pretty gruesome but that's what makes the film a cliff hanger to me. I generally do not like Demi Moore, but she does pretty well in this movie. There is a scene at the end in one of Costner's dreams that is pretty awesome, and unexpected. It's amazing what a cool and calm person Costner portrays when he is such a twisted and manic serial killer inside. I would definitely recommend seeing this film.",Mr. Brooks
365,moshilion,What about Mr Brooks 2 ?,8,9 September 2007,"The ultimate phone call between Mr Brooks and detective Tracy is not innocent. And all personage are preserved : Mr brooks can continue his crimes and detective Tracy will focused on him. It indicate us that Mr Brooks adventures will continue in a second film. And after this ending, there are so many possibilities and developments with Mr brooks,Jane and the detective ! and perhaps Mr Brooks wife knows everything on Mr Brooks crimes ! But the personage of Jane will become most important. Performances of Kevin Costner and Demi Moore in the film are great,but it's not the case for Danielle Panabaker.

366,jagsgm94,This movie is NOT believable,6,24 November 2007,"Very clever, and great depth of character of Mr Brooks. The idea of being able to see how he interacts and thinks by making his sub conscience a real character is brilliant. However where the movie falls apart is with Mr Smith. The fact that he saw the murders take place, and then confronts Mr Brooks only for the reason to be there for his next murder, was a little hard to believe. I somehow convinced myself that in real life that this sort of thing might happen, only to be let down again. The scene where he is targeting the pick up driver at a gas station, where he then stumbles upon another serial killer, ""the hangman killer"". What are the odds of this happening all in one night in a large city? The movie would have been great if this part had been omitted. Just could not get myself to believe that a serial killer and a wanna be serial killer, meets another serial killer by chance, at a gas station in a big city.",Mr. Brooks
367,wcsl-05,Bad Movie,1,6 October 2007,"I cannot believe that Kevin Costner would be in such a disturbing film. I have lost total respect for him as a person and an actor for getting involved with and producing this film. Absolutely disgusting. Why would someone with as many good films behind him get involved with a film that just promotes killing other people? As if murder is somehow an illness, it's not...it's a choice.

And, misguidedly, I read the critic reviews on Rotten Tomatoes (and they didn't care for it very much at all). That said... I loved this movie! This was the perfect character for Costner. I can't imagine anyone else playing Mr. Brooks so well (it must by my evil twin typing this review... the twin that secretly likes Costner). The directing was excellent. The cinematography was excellent. The acting was excellent. The script (while stretching the limits of our ability to suspend disbelief)... was excellent. All in all...

I have to tell you this movie was the best movie I have seen in a long time. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat and kept my interest peeked the whole time. This is a MusT See!!!! This movie is great for psychologists to see. This movie is written to perfection and is based on the perfect crime. I do not want to go into to much detail because I don't want to spoil anything for anyone who hasn't seen it. I hope others find this movie as enjoyable as my husband and I did. I do hope they make a sequel to the movie as it is a great story and could be continued. I give this movie a ten out of a ten.,Mr. Brooks

371,verveleha,don't go there...,1,11 May 2008,"Truly horrible dialog culminating in ""see you later alligator"" was half expecting ""in a while crocodile"" returned. Matched by an awkward score and the worst role I've ever seen Demi Moore in. Hardly a character with any redeeming attributes whatsoever. Dane Cook's Mr Smith evoked a massive desire to witness his untimely exit. The hallway shootout - unconvincing at best. Vile story parading as some insight into addiction. Compare with Americian Psycho or Trainspotting and there's little if any journey into addiction. Hurt and Costner did their best to make this watchable. In fairness I've disliked most Costner's films, certainly not so for Hurt. So much work went into this film visually, which seemed in some parts to be used as filler - still plenty of eye-candy. So bad it was not quite funny. Sorry if I missed the point of making this film.",Mr. Brooks
372,primroseb_uk,Terrible film,1,15 April 2008,"This is an absolutely horrible film, pandering to all the worst possible instincts and should never have been allowed to be made or shown. I watched it on Sky, as my husband wanted to see it when it came out, and should never have watched until the end. The end was a non-event, but since this is going to be a trilogy or something, that was obviously why - we are supposed to want to see some more of this ghastly drivel.It is very disturbing that the film industry seems to be giving people what they want, and they want this - glorifying murder and giving sick people ideas - I just wish they would clean their act up. Disgraceful and disgusting rubbish.",Mr. Brooks
373,ehusoey,Disappointing,3,12 July 2008,"I had really high expectations to this movie, but I have to say I was disappointed.Surprisingly bad acting from especially Kevin Costner and also William Hurt. In my opinion, a character like the one Kevin Costner is playing, has to make the audience feel sorry for him and his situation, and Kevin Costner really doesn't manage to do that. I think that also William Hurt is too one sided in his interpretation of Marshall and therefore neither of these two characters (Mr. Brooks and Marshall) manage to make me engage in this movie. The only one who actually acts good in this movie is Dane Cook as the mental photographer. He is the only one who gives this movie a hint of genuineness.There is also some gaps in the story of this film, like the only thing Det. Atwood reacts on when she enters the crime scene is that the curtains are closed(!) (who doesn't normally when they have sex?) and this is the lead she's following? And like the only reason she's following Mr. Smith is because ""she has a hunch"". What are the odds?This movie was just too circumstantial in my opinion and didn't have any credibility whatsoever.",Mr. Brooks
374,xtreammetalhead,Great Movie for what it is.,8,6 June 2009,"Over all a very entertaining and suspenseful movie. However it did have its flaws. Demi Moore's character was what held this movie back for me. Every time she is on screen I didn't feel as attached to the movie as i wanted to. Her character was a rich woman who became a cop because of problems with her father and she is also some sort of super cop. Its like will smith's character from bad boys, though he pulled it off much better. Not until the end of the movie do you even see the point of her character. They tried given her a background story and wanted you to feel sorry for her, but to me she came across as an angry and obnoxious cop who was just upset about her divorce. They also try giving her a cool little shooting scene, but it didn't work for me. Dane Cook surprised me with his character, he played a great role for being a comic. And Costner and Hurt's characters where very interesting. I would have been more happy with more scenes with them then knowing what Moore's character was doing. Still i recommend this movie and hope for more like it.",Mr. Brooks
375,don-colibri,Brilliant.....,10,21 June 2008,"Wow, just when so many believe that Kevin Costner is finished, washed up after so many failures over the years he comes up with this tour de force....I don't understand why this movie was not more acclaimed or more highly rated. It is stunning and spell-binding from beginning to end. Costner, Moore, Cook and Hurt are all excellent as well. Once he busts out of the ""good guy"" role, he really shines, perhaps he should have done it years ago! It is a little like the TV show ""Dexter,"" you really don't want to find yourself pulling for the evil guy, but it just overpowers you. It is for me one of Costner's best.",Mr. Brooks
376,snc-jobs,An average predictable Thriller,5,14 December 2009,It could have been one of the memorable thriller of all times. Every thing was present in the story to make it a top notch film but the script is so loose that you would be really wondering sometimes that what the actors like Kevin Costner & Demi Moore are doing in it .As far as acting is concerned Kevin Costner & William Hurt was in full form. But the problem with the movie is their respective roles are not well written. There are too many side plots which was sometimes annoying to watch.The story line is not only flat but also predictable for a suspense thriller. The direction was miserable and none of the protagonists apart from Mr. Earl Brooks & his inner self are believable.and as far as Demi Moore's role is concerned she was completely wasted here.So if you are looking for some good crime thriller you would be disappointed.,Mr. Brooks
377,oksekod,Very thrilling indeed.,8,8 November 2008,"To start off if just want to say, what an awesome movie, not to be missed by anyone.The character Mr. Brooks(Kevin Costner) gives the term serial killer a whole new perspective, at least to me. A great performance by Kevin Costner and William Hurt really make this happen in a way that you understand whats going on in Mr. Brooks' life, all his problems and how he copes with them.Dane Cook deliverers a very solid performance as Mr. Smith, the almost wannabee protégé of Mr. Brooks, and doesn't in anyway disappoint.Demi Moore is in charge of the more lighthearted part of the story, as the struggling detective. Her character as the strong woman trying to show her father and the world that she is well capable of controlling her life, has some similarities to Mr. Brooks' daughter, in the way that she also is the daughter of a rich and very powerful man, thus desperately seeking his acceptance.Watch this movie if you in any way enjoy this type of movies, IT'S AN ORDER!!!",Mr. Brooks
378,my_place,Heaven forbid!,4,4 February 2010,"I've just watched that movie. I must say that I'm really disappointed. The plot didn't have much sense and I expected that it would be a deeper psychological insight of the main character! What is more, I don't really understand this idea of his daughter. It wasn't connected with the main plot and I must say it was totally unbelievable! The same situation with the character acted by Demie. I think that details from her personal life were really unnecessary. All in all,many plots, they are not really connected and what is even worse, they are boring. This film bored me to death. I think that director wanted to create something similar to 'Dexter' but the script was too lousy. I didn't believe in that story even for a minute. For me,a waste of time.",Mr. Brooks
379,szozolee,Thrills!,9,23 April 2021,"If your favorites are thrillers, and want a great detective movie, then Mr. Brooks is your case. In the movie Kevin Costner is a famous businessman who - by the way - is serial killer, but wants to stop. William Hurt embodies his evil-self, who wants him to continue, and persuades him to one last murder. I love the dialogues between Kevin Costner and William Hurt, and the way Dane Cook gets into the story. I don't want to reveal much from the main event, but I can say that the whole movie is exciting and has suspense, and the ending is awesome, very well composed, sure to be effective for many of you (the song at the ending always makes me goosebumps). Unfortunately, probably it's because of the little or not very effective advertising of the film, Mr. Brooks didn't become very well known, but even though it's one of my favorite thrillers: 9/10!",Mr. Brooks
380,MrGrieves138,One of the best films of summer 2007,8,21 October 2007,"I am writing to spit in the face of a few of the not-so-good and flat-out bad reviews given to this film.I think that a lot of reviewers didn't want to give this film a positive review because they felt like they shouldn't, because it's a pretty sick film.Richard Roeper referred to this film as a ""guilty pleasure."" He meant that in a good way, but I simply object to using the term ""guilty pleasure"" to really apply to anything you are into. You like what you like, and that's all there is to it, and those two words are used as pure snobbery in most cases, to try to hide yourself from something you like because you feel like you shouldn't. I liked the most recent William Shatner album! It's not a ""guilty pleasure"" because everyone and their mother makes fun of me for liking it, I just like it!A reviewer for Entertainment Weekly idiotically took the perspective of William Hurt's brilliant performance as acting ""out the killer's sick inner child so that Costner doesn't have to."" That makes it sound like the whole movie had to be re-written in order to fit Costner's acting range. Which is stupid, because anyone who actually watches films on a regular basis knows that Costner is a skilled actor with a surprising range. Each person was expertly casted to fit the characters. Mr. Brooks as the businessman is reserved and interested in pottery, and shows little emotion. That's his character. His murdering side, Marshall, is an outspoken, angry, cackling sociopath. Demi Moore's performance has been called ""wooden,"" her character is an exhausted, distracted, irritable cop who is closer to getting to a killer that she has been chasing for years and happens to be in the middle of a messy divorce, what would you expect her to be like? And the people who say that Dane Cook is still in his comedy routine, are you nuts? He is playing a depraved loser who is thrown into a world he is not fit to handle. He is awkward and seems like he doesn't fit, because his character does not fit in Mr. Brooks's world. That is exactly why every character works.Here is the spoiler part. The movie has been criticized by some people by saying that it's ridiculous that Mr. Brooks's daughter is a killer just like him. Were you paying attention?--The whole point of that subplot is that it is never revealed whether or not she killed anyone. It's all happening in Mr. Brooks's head. He is very insane, if you didn't notice, and this has lent itself in this instance to paranoia. Pay attention to f*$#ing film, you overpaid geek with bad taste.This is not your typical serial killer film, which is one reason that makes it stand out. This not only takes you into the inner workings of a killer, but also gives equal weight to the cop on the opposite end of the spectrum. I guarantee that if you give the sequels a chance and allow these characters their due three-movie run, even if this first film felt too dense, they will all pay off in a very unique way.Ignore the snobby, bitter about not having written the novel they always wanted to do, overpaid ""critics"" and see this movie for yourself. If you're willing to waste your time on all three of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, then you can take a little more time to watch a film of a considerably higher caliber that is not a typical horror/thriller/drama film in any sense.",Mr. Brooks
381,spartan_at_the_gates,Ouch,2,4 June 2007,"This was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. I was seriously about to walk out halfway through. Incredibly predictable and horribly acted, this one should have been nixed before it ever got to theaters. Of course, when the star is also producing, it's gonna get made. I've never been a big Demi Moore fan, and she just confirmed my disgust with this one. I thought for a while that maybe it was just the lines that were written for her, but you have to read the script before you agree to do a movie, and she's in the movie, so... And don't even get me started on Dane Cook. How is he still getting work?! The one bright spot in the movie was Kevin Costner's acting. It was refreshing to see him playing something besides a post-apocalyptic baseball player. And of course William Hurt is always good. Makes me wonder why he would agree to do such a waste of film. But those two aren't enough to save this tripe. Save your money and rent a Talented Mr. Ripley flick instead.",Mr. Brooks

Yes, there was some flaws in the movie but none that would make me not want to watch it again & again. Unlike some of the bad reviews I thought Costner played his role effectively & Hurt stole the show. I can't stand Dane Cook who surprisingly was well cast. Moore, her side story, character, hallway shootout scene all cringe worthy. If u take into consideration the barrage of crap constantly streaming out of Hollywood as of late(I don't think I've seen a movie worth watching since The Lincoln Lawyer & Shutter Island) I'm still waiting for Mr Brooks II hopefully w/ a whole lot more of Hurt.OK, I tried to keep it brief & would have been done w/ my review much earlier but I was forced to add more due to IMDb guide lines.",Mr. Brooks

It catches you with unusual plot and point of view but in the end it results disappointing for a lot of reasons. The dialogues are ridiculous and the plot evolves in a similar-splatter movie that made me think about asylum-movies. The setting is even worse than the dialogues trying to copy an atmosphere from an 80's thriller and that isn't only a bad idea but you did it wrong.

386,andreea-bitar,The Curious Case Of Mr. Brooks,9,7 February 2014,"Mr. Brooks is, in my opinion,a dramatic thriller masterpiece. The suspense, horror and mystery elements are brilliantly defined. Although we're talking about a pretty lengthy screening, I had no trouble in watching it without even a toilet break! The vibe this movie gave me (although a 2007 production) is that of a good old fashioned investigation thriller from the 90's, with great actors and true action-loving Hollywood spark. Kevin Costner was, for the part of Mr. Brooks, as Angelina was for Lara Croft: it fit him like a glove. As a matter of fact, all actors were perfectly matched to their characters and I personally found no discrepancy on this aspect. Demi Moore was a bit more ""enthusiastic"" in her acting than her classic, cool self ( see her in G.I. Jane, for instance, where she sported a totally down-to-earth military bad ass attitude), but it went perfectly with her part, which covers some emotional issues as well. The ending was all that I imagined...frankly I have nothing bad to say about the movie, except for, maybe, a bit too much character anticipation on the part of the extremely intelligent, yet not genius, Mr. Brooks.",Mr. Brooks

He's made so many movies that are self-lauding and in this one, he's no doubt the bad guy and the star, and he says, ""I got demons too."" Some of you posters take yourselves way to seriously. Let yourself get inside the symbolism of the characters, how we all have demons, and how life repeats itself. I say go see it, have fun with it, and enjoy the movie for what it is.

389,graciecreel,Spoiler - A different take on Mr Brooks,8,20 April 2015,"I really like the movie Mr Brooks. But when I saw the ending I thought that maybe the whole movie was a dream. So from the beginning he comes home from the celebration and they do go to bed but his dream starts by coming home from the celebration and he goes to his studio, and the rest of the movie but wakes up after his daughter attacks him. Most of you probably don't agree or even had that thought but that is how came across to me. I think the idea of being a perfect serial killer just sounds more like a dream where anything is possible.

Dane Cook is also great in his role and makes you want Brooks to kill him at the end!!This film could do for Kevin Costner what Pulp Fiction did for John Travolta it really is his best performance that i can remember and let him showcase all his incredible skills as an actor. Now I'm just waiting for Tom Hanks to play a serial killer or a darker character!!,Mr. Brooks

393,rhynes-1,"Interesting concept, good acting, lukewarm script.",5,10 June 2007,"Keving Costner and John Hurt were very good. Their ability to play off each other quite wonderful and mesmerizing. Marg Helgenberger was terrific but under utilized. Demi Moore was miscast but rose to the demands of the character. It would have been interesting to see Marg Helgenberger and Demi Moore swap roles. Danielle Panabaker was a fresh face and interesting but could have been eliminated since her character was never completed. The script while good for Costner and Hurt was weak, convoluted, and ultimately predictable - a blind pig could find a truffle. The blood and guts was added to carry the weak script and the ending should have been either feel good or bleak; not both. I would have liked to see if the acorn fell close to the tree.",Mr. Brooks
394,chudson9394,One of the most intelligent Thrillers in a LONG time,9,30 July 2007,"When I heard about ""Mr Brooks"" and that Kevin Costner would be playing the title role I was surprised but at the same time happy to see an Actor who usually stars as the hero would star in a much darker role. I was slight put off by some of the bad reviews when the film was released in the US but I watched it anyway and I have to say it is one of the most intelligent thrillers I have seen since......well you know....since Silence of the Lambs. The way the director portrayed the duality of the killer was very cleverly done and Kevin Costners' acting was very impressive, especially considering he has never done this type of film before. He made the character feel believable, someone you can relate to but at the same time be horrified by. The ending was a very good due to fact that it was not a happy ever after ending. The fault with the film is with Demi Moore herself. I have never liked her as an actress and her part in the film did nothing to change my view of her. I found her too hard and annoying, I would have much preferred someone like Julie-Anne Moore to have played her part but luckily she did not spoil the film too much. This is film is definitely one for the DVD collection. Enjoy and remember to lock your doors but don't rely on the security-chain too much ;-)",Mr. Brooks
395,mng7,Destined to become a classic with trilogy sequels.,9,5 June 2007,"The aptly named Mr. Brooks could be subtitled, ""Mr. President."" As the president of his own company conducting international commerce and residing in a glass house facsimile to Pennsylvania Avenue he provides a micrososm of American societal power. I need to see this one again to delve into the deeper details. I immediately commented to my spouse that this film will have sequels and on further thought I believe it will develop into one or more trilogies that will become as influential as Star Wars. Costner et al have found the newest frontier, the individual as culturally sanctioned antisocial agent. The themes of power, death and sexual expression are portrayed artistically to allow the viewer to take the real journey. Viewers who liked the film ""Meet Joe Black"" and enjoyed watching it multiple times will likely find a challenge in this film.Not a film to be ""enjoyed"" it is deeply thought provoking. Mr. Brooks first reveals, primarily because he retreats, to his hidden life during a dialogue with his wife which has digressed to social gossip. While William Hurt's role threatens early to steal the film, Costner slowly builds his character as you yearn to understand him by getting into his skin. Most Americans would like to be 95% like him. So how much of his problem is biological, environmental (parental and experiential) or social learning? The subtle twists of the film prompt self exploration and could spawn debate. The epitome of community leadership, where are his friends? The ideal husband, he imitates intimacy in his post behavior posings (remember Demi Moore's critique) rather than spend time or make love to his wife(that is reduced to a mandated ""task"" per William Hurt's instructions.) I originally was perturbed that Kevin Costner may have made a ""popular"" film and sold out because he may ""need the income"" since becoming a parent again. I am not disappointed. True to his body of work as a whole he has provided us with a much more artistic and creative vehicle for discovering our ""own story."" I would like to say more about the meaning of the sex and death themes but will wait until the plot is more well known and not risk spoiling the film's mystery (though they are not plot based nonetheless.) I plan to see this film a few more times.",Mr. Brooks
