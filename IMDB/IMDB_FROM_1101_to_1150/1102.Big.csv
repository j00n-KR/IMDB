0,TheLittleSongbird,Charming,8,27 September 2010,"Big does have its minor faults, such as the parents missing a child idea barely registering, but overall while goofy it is also very charming thanks to the performances and chemistry between the two leads. The story is nice and simple, and it is beautifully handled, while the script is witty, funny and quite charming, like the story. Then there is Penny Marshal's polished direction, some nice cinematography and a sweet soundtrack. The best thing though for me was the performances and chemistry of Tom Hanks and Elizabeth Perkins. Hanks is typically fine in his role, and Perkins makes the most of her character, and the two have a very effective chemistry on screen. So overall, very enjoyable and charming, and actually one of the better body-swap movies out there. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Big
1,Leofwine_draca,Likable wish fulfilment movie,6,6 June 2016,"I finally got around to watching BIG purely because it's one of the biggest movies of the 1980s. I should not that I'm not really a huge fan of family comedies like this, so if this is your type of thing I'd add at least a couple of stars to my rating which comes from someone who isn't the target audience.BIG is one in a sub-genre of movies about kids who have the chance to be, well, big. Instead of going down the body-swap route, this film simply has a child version of Tom Hanks making a wish at a fun fair and waking up, adult-sized, the next morning. It's as straightforward as that, with all of the fish-out-of-water hijinks that ensue (taking the form of a child trapped in an adult world).What I liked about this film is that it turns out to be rather touching and with an interesting subtext that explores the loss of innocence and the importance of the formative childhood years. In some ways it evokes a lot of nostalgia in the audience, as well as identifying with us adults who sometimes feel like we're still kids ourselves despite our advancing years. Tom Hanks gives a sweet and likable turn as the lead, but matching him are Robert Loggia (ever the scene-stealer) and Elizabeth Perkins, whose transformation is quite eye-catching. The dancing sequence with Loggia and Hanks is the undoubted highlight here.",Big
2,SnoopyStyle,child within Tom Hanks,8,14 November 2013,"Josh is a regular kid. He can't get the girl. He can't even get on the amusement ride because he's too short. So he makes a wish upon a carnival Zoltar machine. He just wants to be big, and the next morning he wakes up as an adult. The only person who believes him is his best friend Billy.It's a nice premise. Certainly age changing is not a new idea for stories. Nevertheless, it is well written. Director Penny Marshall shows herself to be a very capable director. However this is all dependent on Tom Hanks. He really digs up his inner child with this impersonation of a 12 year old. The joy in his performance is unmistakable. Dancing on the roll out piano is the classic movie scene. Tom Hanks really excels playing around with Jared Rushton or acting childish around the unsuspecting adults.",Big
3,Hitchcoc,Hanks Could Do It All,8,1 December 2016,"Of course, the premise sets up the possibility for an actor to either succeed or fail. If we don't buy into the innocence and the joy of a little boy, it isn't going to happen. By Tom Hanks being cast here, a mediocre script is brought to life. This was later a Broadway play, and when I saw it, I felt a bit cheated. Then it dawned on me that I was so involved in Hanks portrayal that the actor I was watching, as gifted as he was, was a step down. The plot, of course, involves a boy who maintains his childish being in a man's body. The man has choices in his world where the boy did not. Someone could fall in love with him in a romantic way. He, naturally, is clueless and this is bewildering. I remember Peter Sellers in ""Being There."" They are what they are and their environment is in conflict with them. Yet they don't have the intellectual wherewithal to change to adapt. A very nice movie. Unfortunately, a shameless commercial for F.A.O. Schwartz. But that's only a minor point.",Big
4,Horst_In_Translation,Embrace your inner child,8,20 March 2017,"""Big"" is an American English-language movie from 1988, so this one will already have its 30th anniversary next year. It is maybe the most known work by director Penny Marshall, an experienced actress as well. The script is by Gary Ross and you will find many known films in his body of work (after all he has 4 Oscar noms) such as ""The Hunger Games"". His co-writer was Anne Spielberg, sister of Steven, who received her very first and so far only Oscar nomination for this 100-minute film. But the star is of course lead actor Tom Hanks. This film brought Hanks a Golden Globe win and his very first Oscar nomination. In here, he plays a 13-year-old boy in the body of a grown man. The premise is one that could have gone crucially wrong actually if handled with less competence, but Hanks is hitting all the right notes. See for yourself what he does in here and you will most likely agree. Hanks' performance also results in this film being truly memorable in what it teaches the individual audience member, namely to stay young at heart, even if it is not really a voluntary decision for the central character. There are two scenes in particular that emphasize this message. The first would be the piano scene, which is probably the best from the entire film and a moment of true movie magic. It is probably also the reason why Robert Loggia received some awards attention here. The second would be the trampoline scene which is basically a slightly weaker, but still pretty great, version of the piano scene. Another favorite scene for me was the fight with whom you could maybe consider the main antagonist in this film. It shows how the latter is also still very much a child, but not in a good way while Hanks' character's actions are somewhat justifiable by his real age. This also shows that the protagonist is not a hero who wants to help everybody in finding happiness in life and embracing their inner self. They need to want it themselves mostly.This may be a fantasy film to some extent, but it is really much more of a comedy/drama. The references about the reason why he changes (i.e. this strange machine) are kept at a minimum early on in the film and very late. There is no talk about other wishes being granted although honestly this machine could have been used for several sequels. But maybe it is a good thing that it wasn't. I also want to talk a bit about the ending. I really wished for the woman deciding to transform into a child as well, but I think they probably made the right decision. Another reason why this is not really fantasy film and Hanks' character is also in the center of it all. But even if my wish was not granted, I very much liked the ending. It felt authentic and realistic and that's more important than a feel-good happy ending. Not that this was an unhappy ending. Not at all. But really hoping for one particular ending also shows us how much we cared about the characters and their relationships in here. I think this film is a tremendous success and for Hanks probably on par with his very best career efforts. It maybe a bit of a one-man show, but if this one man is as convincing as in here, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. A must-see and my new favorite film from 1988. Of course the script is really good too. Only one example: the ways in which the kids react towards the grown-ups: The best friend tells the protagonist how he looks like **** as a grown-up or the best friend is disgusted by the protagonist's girlfriend. This is exactly the way kids would react in this scenario. Very well done. No surprise everybody loves Hanks with films like this in his body of work.",Big
5,lee_eisenberg,"Happy 50th, Tom!",10,9 July 2006,"As today is Tom Hanks's 50th birthday, I thought it appropriate to review one of his funniest movies. ""Big"" portrays a boy who wishes to be big, and gets turned into an adult (Hanks), thereby having to learn on his own how to navigate the adult world. As a previous reviewer noted, the movie also does a good job showing how he comes to realize that it is better to experience childhood before growing up.But even aside from all that, you gotta figure that Tom Hanks must have really had fun playing the role, especially in the scene right after the boy grows up overnight. It just goes to show what a great director Penny Marshall is; in fact, she later directed Hanks in ""A League of Their Own"". Also starring Elizabeth Perkins, Robert Loggia, John Heard, Jon Lovitz and Mercedes Ruehl.You know, it seems like ever since Tom Hanks got into serious roles, people have forgotten how great his comedic ones were. I can't understand why ""Joe vs the Volcano"" and ""Bonfire of the Vanities"" are regarded with such scorn.",Big
6,jboothmillard,Big,8,8 July 2005,"One of the best performances from the lead actor, and from director Penny Marshall (A League of Their Own), this is a fantastic family comedy film. The film focuses on young Josh Baskin (David Moskow) who is humiliated at a carnival for being too short for a ride, when he sees a wish/fortune telling machine called Zoltar Speaks, and after his wish to be ""big"" is granted, he sees the machine was unplugged! The next morning he sees an unfamiliar face in the mirror, he has grown into an adult (Golden Globe winning winning, and Oscar nominated Tom Hanks). When his mother (The Fisher King's Mercedes Ruehl) sees him she believes he is an intruder who has kidnapped, so (after proving his identity) he can only depend on his best friend Billy Kopecki (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids' Jared Rushton). They send a form to get information for another Zoltar machine location, but it might take at least 6 weeks. In the meantime Josh manages to get a lowly data-entry job at the MacMillan Toy Company. After meeting the company owner, MacMillan (Independence Day's Robert Loggia) at FAO Schwarz toy store, he impresses him with his childlike enthusiasm for toys, and a memorable duet on the giant electronic foot-operated piano playing Chopsticks and Heart and Soul. Josh is promoted to a dream job being paid simply for testing toys, he also contributes in many discussions for new toy ideas. He soon attracts the attention of beautiful, ambitious fellow toy executive Susan Lawrence (The Flintstones' Elizabeth Perkins), and a romance develops, which annoys the guy she was originally with, Paul Davenport (Home Alone's John Heard). Eventually, the information for another Zoltar machine comes, but Josh is ignoring Billy and sticking with Susan. He knows though that he should go back to his normal childhood life, and after trying to explain his situation to Susan, which she misunderstands and doesn't believe, he wishes he was a normal kid again. It is sad to see them split, but Susan does see Josh go back to normal, and she knows it is right. Also starring Jon Lovitz as Scotty Brennen and Josh Clark as Mr. Baskin. There are plenty a laughs, particularly from the childish behaviour of actors, and Hansk is a terrific performer, an essential film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Tom Hanks was number 3 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 39 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 42 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, and it was number 33 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Very good!",Big
7,rmax304823,Feelgood Fantasy.,6,12 February 2012,"If you were a baby boomer born in, say, 1948, you'd have turned 40 in the year this movie was released. Forty is an age to conjure with. You're no longer simply no longer just a kid. Forty is the doorway to middle age. You aren't going to become president. You aren't going to discover some hidden talent and become a virtuoso in the bassoon. You're not going to throw away all material hindrances and become a Tibetan monk. You're going to stay pretty much what you are.The idea of becoming younger again, or at least being ordinary or even less than ordinary, yet taken for something more than you are, must have been an appealing one because there were a number of movies about the subject that came out about the same time -- not just ""Big,"" but ""Rain Man,"" ""Forest Gump,"" ""Being There,"" and some others whose names I forget. And before that there was ""Charlie."" In this one, the thirteen-year-old Tom Hanks wishes he could be big like adults and -- poof -- he wakes up one morning and he's Tom Hanks. By a fluke -- there are always a lot of flukes in this genre -- he finds a job as an adviser in a New York toy company and, being a whiz at computer games and toys, works his way up to Vice President. The story so far has its charming moments.Then the tale turns a bit, from charming to sentimental. Hanks and Elizabeth Perkins fall in love. There is a fade just before Perkins and the still mentally thirteen-year-old Hanks make love for the first time. Too bad. I'll bet that was the funniest scene of all.The acting isn't bad. Not much is called for. Elizabeth Perkins and Tom Hanks are both very good at being ""puzzled"". As is usual in this genre, Hanks' ignorance is taken for uber-sophistication. When his boss, Robert Loggia, asks if he's seen the market report, Hanks replies, ""What's a market report?"" Loggia shakes his head in agreement -- they don't tell you much, do they? Perkins is quite appealing but I noticed a curious thing. When we see someone on the screen who is handsome or beautiful, we seem to unconsciously compare them to others in their logical set. By this standard, Perkins is routinely pretty. But I'd worked with her on a film and found her to be more than just routinely pretty. She was stunning. It's as if, watching an attractive person on screen, we see them as just one entry in a book of mug shots of beautiful people instead of as individuals in the same room. On screen, they look good. In the supermarket, they'd be magnetic.Well, that's neither here nor there. This film fits into Penny Marshall's oeuvre readily enough. Her movies, like Carl Reiner's and Ron Howard's, lean towards an exoteric combination of heart-warming recognition, mild amusement, fuzzy charm, and wistful sentiment. Nothing much new but if you're in the mood for it --",Big
8,Tweekums,A delightful comedy,8,18 April 2015,"Twelve year old Josh Baskin is fed up of being small; one night, after being turned away from a fair ground ride because of his size he sees a strange machine. It claims to grant wishes and he wishes he were big when he wakes up the next morning he is! He isn't just taller though; he is an adult! Understandable distressed he returns to the fairground but it has gone. Returning home his mother naturally freaks out and believes the man in front of her has kidnapped her son. He manages to persuade his friend who he really is and sets off to New York hoping to find a way of locating the machine. While there he gets a job at a toy company. His child's mind enables him to come up with ideas for toys that children will really like rather than those adults think they will like. This leads to his rapid promotion and jealousy from one co-worker and the attraction of another who falls for his innocence of course she doesn't know Josh's age! As time passes he settles into the adult world but ultimately realises he misses his childhood.This film is a lot of fun thanks to its childlike simplicity what child hasn't dreamt of being an adult and just as importantly what adult hasn't occasionally wished they could return to their childhood. Tom Hanks does a great job as the adult Josh; making us believe the character is a child at heart even if he behaves like a child quite a bit younger than twelve at times. Elizabeth Perkins does a fine job as love interest Susan; the scene where she and Hanks bounce on a trampoline in his apartment is a delight. John Heard is suitable unpleasant as Josh's rival we are shown that even though he is a 'real' adult he can be childish at times. While there are some darker elements; most notable Josh letting his mother thing he has been kidnapped they are largely glossed over to keep everything fun. It could be argued that there are too many loose ends at the films conclusion but that doesn't matter as it isn't meant to be taken too seriously; it is a fun film that should entertain children who will laugh at an adult behaving like a child and adults who will be taken back to the simple fun one can have as a child.",Big
9,moonspinner55,"Modern-day fantasy that, alas, falls into all the standard conventions...",5,6 April 2008,"Tom Hanks is young and charming playing a little boy in a grown man's body. A youngster with growing pains makes a wish one night (via a fortune teller machine) to be ""big"" and the following morning wakes up to a new reflection in the mirror: a hairy guy with long legs. Director Penny Marshall works this material with a light, sensitive touch, but when Hanks falls into a job at a toy development company, and inadvertently romances co-worker Elizabeth Perkins, the scenario becomes a rather uncomfortable big business satire, a fish-out-of-water fantasy which smacks of commercial pandering (with echoes of ""Being There"" besides!). Audiences at the time didn't seem to mind, however the film hasn't aged well, while the mercilessly drawn-out finale has romantic delusions which seem just a bit jarring. ** from ****",Big
10,blanche-2,Still a boy at heart,9,26 May 2006,"""Big"" is a captivating, funny, heartwarming movie starring Tom Hanks. It is well deserving of any and all accolades. A kid, Josh, makes a wish at a carnival machine to be big - and Zoltar grants it. The boy becomes a man - on the outside, anyway. When Josh's own mother doesn't know him, his best friend helps him relocate in New York City while his family thinks he's been kidnapped. He finds a job at a toy company and the big boss (Robert Loggia) recognizes him as an eccentric genius, continually promoting him over his competition (John Heard). A young woman in the company (Elizabeth Perkins) falls in love with him. When he brings her to his new, gorgeous apartment, she sees his bunk bed, soda machine, and trampoline.This movie was remade as ""13 Going on 30,"" which was also a delightful movie, but not nearly as memorable as ""Big."" As we watch Hanks spitting out Beluga caviar at the office party, eating his way through the buffet, and dressing in what can only be called a white Elvis tuxedo, we realize how far we all are from our child within and that sense of wonder and freedom that brings with it original thoughts and creativity. As the boy Josh starts identifying more with his external appearance and discovers sex and the pressures of work, he realizes that something is missing.Everyone in the film is excellent, including Josh's adult love interest, Elizabeth Perkins, John Heard, Robert Loggia, Mercedes Ruehl, and Jared Rushton as Billy, Josh's best friend. The end is adorable and worthy of some tears - which I shed. Highly recommended.",Big
11,studioAT,Big hearted film,5,11 April 2017,"This is one of those big comedies that Tom Hanks did so well at the start of his career, and yet doesn't do anymore. I think it's testament to this film that all these years later, and despite the success he's had in many other films, this is still one of the films that Tom Hanks is most associated with.It's a good film, one of the many 'body swap' films of the 80's. I think I prefer some of the others, but this has its moments, and a good central performance by Hanks.I found Elizabeth Perkins's character a bit dull throughout though. She goes from cold hearted business woman to viable love interest all too quickly.For a good 80's comedy you can't look further than 'Big'.",Big

13,hitchcockthelegend,Big comedy with a big heart.,9,12 January 2010,"Tired of being small, 12 year old Josh Baskin makes a wish on a funfair fortune telling machine that he wants to be big. He awakes in the morning to find that he is in the body of an adult but still the same young Josh within. Chaos quickly takes hold and Josh has to flee to the city. Where, aided by his best friend Billy, they hope to track down the now moved on ""Zoltar"" machine and wish Josh back to his normal self. But it's going to take time to track it down so Josh has to take a job and things are about to get interesting indeed.Tom Hanks (Adult Josh) was literally just around the corner from hitting the A list of Hollywood. His performance in this smashing, bittersweet comedy bagged him an Oscar nomination and helped him turn that particular corner. Directed by Penny Marshall, Big is arguably the best of all the body-swap comedies that have dotted themselves along the plentiful cinematic road. Receiving critical acclaim on release, its success lies not just in its appealing for the majority fairytale formula, but also with the star turn from Hanks, astute writing (Gary Ross/Anne Spielberg) and adroit direction.It's not just a ball of fluff movie either, in amongst the plentiful laughs and heart lifting moments, there's food for thought involving life and its pacing. And there's a big intriguing ponder constantly hanging in the air; viewing the world thru a child's eyes may actually make more sense, especially in business! These things are given impetus by Hanks' fabulous show, from his terrifying first night in the city alone, to the sexual awakening brought out by his relationship with Elizabeth Perkins' (sparky and effective) Susan Lawrence (the latter of which is smoothly handled by Marshall), Hanks convinces and takes us with him into his new confusing world. Fine support comes from Robert Loggia as the boss won around by Josh's playful approach to work, and Jared Rushton as best friend Billy gives the film a firm footed axis between the old & young Josh.There's some itches there, such as the barely registered grief of the parents missing a child, and there's always the old inevitability chestnut to linger in the background. But they are but mere small flaws in an otherwise wonderful movie. A film that both children and adults can watch and garner some form of resonance from. 8.5/10",Big
14,Theo Robertson,Hanks Fans Will Love It,6,25 August 2004,"I had received a free DVD of BIG via a Sunday newspaper promotion but had put off watching it for a very long time for two reasons
1 ) I`ve never been keen on Tom Hanks who I`ve found to be one of the most overrated movie stars of the last 15 years 2 ) Comedies ( A genre I don`t like at the best of times ) from the 1980s are very shallow with the musical soundtrack being the most important aspect of the production I must say that after seeing BIG I thought it was far better than I was expecting . The lean uncomplicated script gets to the main plot of Josh turning into an adult quickly and the production team resist all temptation to turn the movie into an OTT farce . There are a few things that you`d expect in a Tom Hanks movie ( Even in a breakthrough role like this one ) like mawkish sentiment and Hanks adopting a sad , little boy lost look all the way through the movie but these points aren`t really meant as criticism
If you`re a Tom Hanks fan you`ll love BIG . I`m not a fan of either Hanks or comedy movies so I voted this movie six out of ten . It`s not bad but it`s not a classic either",Big
15,jotix100,There's no place like home!,8,5 September 2006,"Be careful what you wish for because it might come true and you might live to regret it. This seems to be the cautionary message at the center of this enjoyable film, which we saw when it made its debut in 1988. Watching it a second time, still holds our attention as the director, Penny Marshall, clearly takes us for a ride with Josh, as he becomes a man before hand.Josh, the New Jersey boy who is unhappy by being excluded of some fun things because of his age, asks Zoltar at the fair, for a wish which he is told has been granted. Imagine Josh's surprise the next morning waking up in the body of a grown up. His whole world comes crashing down on him. With the help of his best friend, Billy, he escapes to Manhattan, where he will go unnoticed.The young man is in for a rude awakening, but his child-like attitude opens all the doors for him. When he applies to work at MacMillan's toys, he is a happy boy that has been given a candy. Because Josh is genuine, he will rise to the top at the firm and even find love with Susan, an executive woman that falls for his charming way and innocence.The film is made more enjoyable by Tom Hanks. He is perfect as Josh, a boy at heart, with no malice. Elizabeth Perkins makes a good Susan. Jared Rushton plays Billy, the loyal friend. Robert Loggia is the owner of the firm. John Heard appears as Paul an executive who sees his star downgraded by the arrival of Josh.Highlights of the film have to be the F.A.O. Schwartz sequence where Josh and Mac play on the floor piano and the party scene where Josh eats beluga caviar!Great film for all ages thanks to Penny Marshall and the magic she created with this film.",Big
16,Boba_Fett1138,Movie made interesting by Hanks.,7,13 March 2004,"The success of the movie is mainly thanks to Tom Hanks performance that awarded him his first Oscar nomination.The story and the movie itself are pretty simple and a bit corny at times but who really cares? It is a family movie and doesn't need any complexity. The only thing that troubled me about the story was that Josh did all kind of things that an 12 year old would never do when he finds himself in a grown up body. Instead of doing all kind of grown up things and taking advantage of it in certain situations, he chooses to do all kind of playful things, which was a bit corny and simple in my opinion but that's why it's a family movie.It sounds weird but I think this movie is already a bit outdated even though it is only 16 years old. The story and the toys and the use of it are the main reasons why I think it is outdated and why kids might not find this movie so appealing as kids did 16 years ago. Also, the typical '80's soundtrack (you know what I mean) doesn't make the movie any younger.The characters and the actors are good. John Heard plays aside from Tom Hanks a good role. Above average comedy that is worth seeing but that will not stand the test of time.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Big
17,view_and_review,An Adult Kid with Money and Freedom,9,25 September 2019,"After watching Freaky Friday and Vice Versa it only made sense to watch Big. Big was the best of the three.In early 1988 Vice Versa came out in which a father and son switched bodies. The son had to go to his father's job as an executive at a Chicago merchandising company and also maintain a relationship with his father's GF. He got to rock out in the mall which earned him brownie points with the boss and he got to live the life of an adult.Later in 1988 Big came out in which Josh (David Moscow/Tom Hanks) wished to be ""big"" and his wish was granted in the form of making him an adult. He found a job at a toy company in New York, got romantically involved with a woman, and played a floor piano in FAO Schwartz which earned him brownie points with the boss.Big was funnier while also being more serious and more dramatic. Its cute parts were cuter, its funny parts were funnier, its dramatic parts were more dramatic which all made for a better overall movie.Both movies had a message of: kids can teach adults a lot. Josh's sincerity and innocence was infectious. Of course, it presumes that all 13-year-olds are innocent and sincere, but for the purposes of this movie he was. The effects of adulthood were visibly altering Josh which started once he had sex. That was pretty much the quieter, subtler message: sex ends innocence.Before the end of that innocence Josh was living the life that just about any kid would want to live. He had money and freedom. An adult with money and freedom has too many worries still like family, bills, health, the future, social aesthetics, etc. so he may not be able to enjoy the money and freedom. A child on the other hand can live it up. There's no thinking about tomorrow, no concern of how much money is in the bank, no worry about optics, no hankering over health, or anything else. He can play until his heart's content and sleep like a baby.That was the appeal of Big. He could've been big with a family, big in prison, big with an illness, or big with any number of problems. Any one of those scenarios could've been explored but where would be the fun in that? Big with money and freedom, that's the adulthood that kids dream of.",Big
18,evanston_dad,Tom Hanks as a Twelve-Year-Old,6,28 July 2008,"Penny Marshall's film about a boy and his father whose personalities switch bodies set off a boom of like-minded films, but this one remains the best of them. That's largely due to Tom Hanks' rambunctious performance as a twelve-year-old trapped in a grown man's body. All of the physical antics you would expect are there, but he does a pretty good job of getting into the head of a little boy as well, so his performance has a heart to match its physicality.Marshall is a spectacularly mediocre director, so this movie suffers from the same qualities that all of her movies do: it's too gentle, soft and sweet, and it's completely lacking in any discernible style. But it's worth watching for Hanks' inspired comic performance.Grade: B",Big
19,Aaron1375,When I watched this movie for the first time as a kid I just wished it would be over.,4,26 March 2010,"Do not get me wrong, the film had a few humorous scenes here and there, but overall it just was not a movie that I enjoyed all that much. It was made during a time when other films like this one were made with two other movies ""Like Father, Like Son"" and ""Vice Versa"" also coming out in the time this one was released. Kind of like the science fiction comedy threesome ""My Science Project"", ""Weird Science"" and ""Real Genuises"" that came out at once point in the 80's and the underwater action/horror set ""Deepstar Six"", ""Leviathon"" and ""The Abyss"". This one was by far the most successful of the trio of body switching type movies and I do believe Tom Hanks got an Oscar nomination for his role in this movie. Which I will admit he did a very good job of playing a grownup who was a child only a couple of days ago, but he did not really act like the child he supposedly was. The kid he was supposed to be was just more reserved than the character Tom Hanks seemed to be portraying. He seemed to be portraying a less mature kid with a bit of hyperness to him. The story is about a kid who makes a wish to be big and gets it and there are some nice scenes here and there. I think the movie fell apart though when he got the higher paying job at the company though as after the chop sticks dance the only thing I thought was mildly funny was the scene where he questioned the building robot and when he tried to eat the baby corn. Add to that a cringe worthy scene where he is about to have sex and you really have to imagine my embarrassment as a kid sitting with my mom through that. To many scenes like that not enough really funny scenes and you have your typical dramedy. A comedy that just adds to much plot and not enough laughs to be something I can enjoy. Still, most people like it so I would read what others have to say about it before condemning the movie all together based on my review. To be honest, dramedies are not a favorite genre of movies for me at all.",Big

There are various other parts in this machine that work beautifully (Robert Loggia, Jared Rushton), but it's his chemistry with these actors that ultimately pulls this off. I don't look at Tom Hanks and see a movie star - I see an honest-to-god 13 year-old in an adult body.There's a childlike innocence at the heart of all of this (despite Mercedes Ruehl's tortured mom and that creepyass Zoltar machine) and I guess you could write if off as some fluffy '80s comedy.

23,StevePulaski,"Big idea, small execution, middling end result",5,17 February 2016,"NOTE: This film was recommended to me by Kimberly Winters Gautier for the ""Steve Pulaski Sees It."" If there's one genre of films that has never particularly done much for me, it's the ""body swapping"" genre of films, and while Penny Marshall's Big takes a creative new spin on the genre, it still can't overcome its pretty uninteresting concept. The film revolves around a thirteen-year-old named Josh Baskin (David Moscow), who lives in New York with his parents who decide to visit the local carnival one day. After trying to impress a schoolgirl with his bravery by going on a roller-coaster and subsequently being shooed away because he isn't of adequate height, Josh uses a fortune teller machine to wish he was bigger.The next morning, Josh wakes up a thirty-five-year-old man and utterly horrified by his growth spurt. He quickly darts out of his home after his mother mistakes him for a burglar, and knowing he can't go home and explain the situation to his mother, he calls on his best friend Billy (Jared Rushton) to assist him in his new adult adventures. Before long, Josh goes to work for a toy company, using his own prior knowledge as to what kids enjoy in order to become a successful employee at the company. He also winds up developing a crush on his coworker Susan Lawrence (Elizabeth Perkins) over time, despite her not knowing his unbelievable secret.Adult Josh is played by a very young Tom Hanks in what is often considered his breakout role, and to his credit, Hanks is a commendable, charismatic presence all the way through Big. His role requires a boatload of energy and charm, which he has no problem delivering, and his cheery smile is enough to warrant at least some pleasure in this film. The problem with Big, despite its wholesomeness and its innocuous premise, is that it's simply not a very interesting film and it all starts with its bogus storyline. For one, we never really get an explanation of whether or not Josh is functioning with the mind of a thirteen-year-old in a thirty-five-year-old body or if he has a thirty-five-year-old mind in a thirty-five-year-old's body. Right there, it sets up a conflict of interest based around the character since we're not entirely sure on what wavelength he is operating.Second of all, the humor in the film is not particularly funny. Isolated scenes like the famous rendition of ""Chopsticks"" on a life-sized piano are fun, but little in the film is humorous or very memorable because of its situational comedy. When a film tackles a premise like this, there should at least be some kind of consistent humor coming from the plot, but all there seems to be a string of ironic, coincidental, or predictable sequences involving the bizarre concept of a thirteen-year-old inheriting the body of an adult (in a screenplay written by Gary Ross and Anne Spielberg, the sister of Steven Spielberg).It's that and the film's general predictability that wore on me; when the relationship between Josh and Susan begins to brew, the film almost effectively abandons any attempt at being funny to take a more romantic route. Right there, we have three genres - fantasy, comedy, and romance - that all feel like they're being handled in a half-baked manner that lacks any kind of narrative conviction. While Big may have spirit and a talented cast of talents - its leading performer going on to earn Oscar nominations and being regarded as one of the finest American actors working today - it lacks the kind of humor that its premise so readily demands and settles on being simple, basic cable entertainment.Starring: Tom Hanks, Elizabeth Perkins, Jared Rushton, and David Moscow.

24,Smells_Like_Cheese,Remember when we used to want to be big?,9,28 March 2004,"Ah, those were the days. All of us have done it. Wished we were older, so we could do more. Well, in the movie ""Big"", a child's wish to become big comes true.Josh is a boy who is not tall enough to ride a roller coaster at a theme park. Humilated in front of a girl he likes, he goes to a ""fortune telling"" machine, and wishes he could be bigger. He wakes up the next day as a man. When everyone he knows throws him out of their lives, except his best friend, he goes into the adult world. Just by knowing what kids want in toys, he becomes a success in a toy company. He also manages to get a girl wanting him(even though he is completely oblivious to it). All he wants is be himself again.9/10",Big
25,MovieAddict2016,The Yearnings of Childhood...,6,10 April 2003,"Certain films spark imagination and warmth; they make you feel good. They are witty, intelligent and have very original and intriguing ideas (""Groundhog Day,"" ""Memento,"" ""It's a Wonderful Life""). Then there are some that have good premises but become tiresome after a while (""Brewster's Millions,"" ""The Man with Two Brains,"" and ""Delirious"" to some extent). ""Big"" fits in the category ""Good Idea, Good Premise, Good Actors, Intelligent Script, and Boring After an Hour.""Our story begins with a short teen named Josh, who dreams of girls, girls, sports, being older (so he can impress girls), and girls. So one day, at a carnival, after being shrugged off by (guess who?) a girl, a miserable and sad Josh makes a wish at a fortune telling machine, which slides out a card after your wish that says if it's been granted or not (if I remember correctly). So Josh goes home, mopes about, goes to sleep, and when he wakes up he is a thirty-something-year-old Tom Hanks (wonderful if in his part, even if he acts like a toddler more than a teenager). After his mother thinks Big Josh is a crazy loon, she chases him out of the house with a knife. (Later she thinks Josh has been kidnapped/killed after he disappears from home.)So Josh, with the help of his friend, retreats into New York City, where he lives in a seedy apartment (great scene involving that), and, being a child, is scared witless. After a few days (or one day?) Josh, again with the help of his friend, gets a job at a toy company, only because the employer likes his goofiness so much. (Josh shows up in a cheap, disgusting suit and says he went to college at his Middle School.)Of course, being a child, Josh soon beats bad-man John Heard in toy ideas (he comes up with wacky inventions, because he is a kid and he knows what kids really like, and he unintentionally criticizes Heard's toys). He comes up with all kinds of ideas for toys not out of greed, but because he innocently wants to create good toys for kids.Tom Hanks plays his character well, if a bit too childish. Let's face it: Thirteen-year-old boys are old enough to know that when women say they want to ""sleep over"" they don't mean they want to have a sleep over party. But aside from the fact that he doesn't act like a thirteen-year-old, Hanks hits the nail on the head and gives a tremendously innocent and sweet performance. It's just too bad that the main character had to be thirteen (or fourteen), because Hanks doesn't act thirteen (or fourteen). It's still a great performance, though.Nowadays this film would probably tag a PG-13 rating, because not only does a teenager (much less an adult) use the F-word (which was startling to hear in a Tom Hanks PG-rated movie), but there are also sexual situations involving teenagers. At one point Hanks sleeps with a business associate in her thirties (Elizabeth Perkins). Of course, this means that since Hanks' character is really a teenager, it means the teenager had sex with her--which implies some controversial subjects. In fact (spoiler ahead), when Josh (Hanks) tells the woman he is a teenager, she doesn't seem to show any surprise that she has slept with a thirteen-year-old, though it is implied they have slept together many, many times during the course of the film. (They even live together at one point.) She just seems to be surprised overall, not at anything (ahem) in particular.Sometimes ""Big"" seems like it was written by teenagers thinking of cool things they would do if they happened to become adults one day. I guess this works to the film's advantage in a way, because if it was written by real adults (who have forgotten childhood yearning), the film would end up with Josh doing too many adult things and not enough childish things.But right there I contradict myself, because I have found that at one point in the film when, in a matter of seconds, Josh puts behind his childhood and seems to grow up very suddenly--something I think was done a bit too quick--the film seems to lose its charm. If Josh is a child at heart, how could he suddenly, in a matter of minutes, gain the knowledge of a college-graduate in business economics, if he didn't even finish middle school? I think that bit is done to be symbolic--that all of us have seemed to lose our innocence at a certain age, out of expectations of doing so, or because of a ruthless world that beats down upon our childish souls--but it doesn't all fit together too well.The film is funny, but like many films with great premises, they outstay their welcome, ultimately ending in a funny, if not memorable film. I really expected a lot from ""Big"" because of the big deal everyone made about it, but I would say that after a while the gags become too worn out. There's only so many things you can have a teenager do in a grown man's body, and, unfortunately, ""Big,"" ranking in at about 90 minutes, only uses half of what it could have. It seems to search for gags in the latter half, but can't find them when they're right in front of them. Perhaps some of this is because Hanks acted too immature in his role (even though he gave a tremendous performance), or perhaps it is because the writers gave up on the film too quickly. Whatever the reason, ""Big"" doesn't fulfill all it could have, and ultimately ends up just funny, and nothing entirely memorable.

26,DKosty123,Giant Keyboard For New Director,7,13 February 2008,"This film is one of the earlier films directed by Penny Marshall. It still holds up as one of her better efforts. It would be easy for a director to slow the pace of this film too much & make it stop in it;s tracks & get very boring. Marshall doesn't let that happen, as in a way her direction her shows better in many ways than her later film with Tom Hanks - A League of Their Own.Hanks is the lynch pin in this film. Some how he brings off a believable performance as a young teenage boy who suddenly overnight gets a grown mans body. I think the fantasy of this film did catch a lot of female imaginations as there seems to be more women now having affairs with underage boys. That message is loud & strong in this movie as a grown woman essentially falls in love with an underage boy in a man's body.It amazes me how powerful media messages are & how people sometimes allow the media to lead their life. This movie has that strong fantasy message for women because of the view it gets from Marshall's directing. That is why I think it is her best directing effort. While the cast here isn't as talented as League Of Their Own, it can hold it's own as far as talent.Another powerful message in the film is the musical keyboard sequence as there were several toy innovations which were inspired by this including some of the music video games which came out recently. Overall this is Hanks show but Marshall shows director talent in this movie.",Big
27,lasttimeisaw,Big,7,7 May 2011,"BIG is the film that enlist Tom Hank's name to a prestigious status as a bankable comedian, also magnifies his comedic artistry to the maximum echelon (of course, later we would know he is a much more chameleonic actor whom we could not curb solely in the comedy sector), which attested by his first Oscar nomination, and furthermore, it was a rare instance of the academy members acknowledged a commonly overlooked lighthearted performance.The film'a hypothesis of dream-comes-true is effortless to some degree (though the Zoltar machine is creepy), and which could have been fabricated into a more adventurous gambit, nevertheless, director Penny Marshall knowingly chose a more familial and kid-friendly approach to liberate the scenario by steeping all the empathy into a syrup called innocuousness, even the inappropriate adult sex scene is sterilized to eschew any dirty thoughts (the most obvious one jumped into my mind is the inter-generational love). Thankfully the result is fairly acceptable, largely owes to Tom Hank's adroit acting skills of being so compelling as a boy trapped inside a man's body at the age of 32; by contrast, with a similar plot, in 13 Going 30 (2004), Jennifer Garner is much flimsier to showcase a child's innate qualities (you can call it gender discrimination if you like, which alas still persists now). I also utterly enjoy a young Elizabeth Perkins playing her adept role as the seasoned type, the glint between her and Mr. Hanks is quite believable, regardless how implausible the story is. The most praiseworthy merit of the film is that it contains a positive conviction and renders an inner strength to motivate every adult audience to scan oneself and manage to retrieve the most precious quality before it's too late, the pureness once we all possessed.",Big
28,thesar-2,Extended Cut? Big Mistake,8,28 April 2013,"I don't remember the first time I saw Big, but I remember watching it many times and, of course, relating, since I was the same age as the boys in the film. So much so, the Billy character, played by Jared Rushton, was born just 12 days before me.So, naturally, this is many boys' fantasies come true, as was mine back then. But, beyond that, it was a special, heartfelt, deep and often hilarious film. That all said, it should come with a warning:STAY AWAY FROM THE EXTENDED CUT.It's been many years, decades even, since I last watched this. Recently, I purchased it on BluRay and incorrectly, I chose the Extended Cut when prompted after the disc was inserted. Even though it had been many eons since I saw it last, I instantly caught EVERY SINGLE UNNECESSARY SCENE of the 26 additional minutes. Not only was it wise to withdrawal these from the theatrical cut, but they sincerely took away this experience of revisiting one of my childhood favorites. Hopefully, I will rewatch this again sooner than I did last time, but I sure as hell will cut out the Extended Cut.Whew, getting that out of the wayTom Hanks hasn't always been one of my favorites. Granted, back in the late 80s to mid-90s, he was on fire and I was right there with him. So, since we're focusing in on Big, he was fantastic. I could see the boy/man in him the whole way, even though we only briefly saw the boy he grew from in the first act.I'm getting ahead of myself. After a string of ""you're just a kid"" moments of embarrassment, normal 13-year-old, Josh, wishes he was ""big"" in front of a fortune telling carnival machine. Mercifully, the machine he uses to make that wish knew what he meant by ""big"": to be an adult. Overnight, he does, in fact, become an adult and all Hades breaks lose.Nicely, writers Gary Ross and Anne Spielberg explored all angles I could think of on what would happen if suddenly a 13-year-old boy becomes a 30-year-old male. The confusion and mindset of said boy is shown perfectly in (adult Josh's) Tom Hanks.Luckily for Josh, he has his BFF, 13-year-old Billy, to aid him in the transition to adulthood, even though neither knew what they're doing.Obviously, the results of Josh making it as an adult with virtually no money, life experience and in New York City, is highly unrealistic, but then so is the initial premise. So, it's safe to get past it, and enjoy his often hilarious fly-by-the-seat-of-their-pants journey to get Josh into a VP – VICE PRESIDENT?? – job at a toy company. There, he meets some great supporting casts and grows up too quickly.Like I said, he does grow up rapidly, but the transition is believable and helped with the great direction, screenplay, co-stars and Tom Hanks' abilities.This movie is often forgotten and totally 80s, but if you saw and loved it as a kid, you'll appreciate even the more adult humor that most – I didn't – catch when I was a youngling. Also in our time of raunchy, juvenile comedies, it was a refreshing PG-rated fantasy/comedy/romance.Absolutely recommended. Go Big!",Big
29,ElMaruecan82,A reverse 'coming of age' story ... carried by Tom Hanks' irresistible performance ...,8,5 December 2011,"""Big"" is the kind of film that is impossible to dislike no matter how 'big' the flaws can get. It doesn't avoid some clichés, some over-the-top acting, but all in all,l Penny Marshall's fantasy classic is an endearing piece of originality deprived from cynicism and convenient political incorrectness, with this perfect dosage of comedy and poignancy that appeals to both adults and kids. I, for one, forgive what I said about predictability, since I can't even avoid formulaic expressions while reviewing ""Big"".""Big"" is a sincere and genuine invitation to value childhood and its underrated impact on our lives. ""Big"" reminded me of ""Stand by Me"", Rob Reiner's bittersweet classic where the narrator remembers what being thirteen was like: playing, sharing secrets, having fun with pals before girls started to invade private thoughts, never needing to act seriously, expressing imagination and sticking together while enduring the bullying from the elder and naturally, the torment of being 'small'. ""Big"" magically translates the inner insecurity of childhood through the portrayal of a little boy who desires to become a grown-up, 'big' in his own words.What really precedes the magical transition hardly matters, and I guess this is why the film gets so quickly to the point, it's very hard to imagine why Josh Baskin, wants to be big, to do the roller-coaster? to impress a girl, obviously too mature for him? The wish he makes to a magical fortune-telling machine seems more like a strong will to be and to act like an adult, which contrast with his surprise to wake up the day after as a grown thirty-something man. David Moskow played young Josh with such realistic maturity that the connection with Josh in Tom Hanks' body is hardly noticeable unless I considered that it's Josh' defensive reaction of becoming an adult that awakened the most childish mannerisms. Still, Hanks acted as 10-11 year old kid.This is why I talked about flaws, but never mind, Tom Hanks acts in such a convincing way as a little kid that sometimes it's very hard to 'get', especially in the beginning, but as the movie progresses, it gets more and more natural. And the part where he's forced to sleep in a motel and breakdowns in his bed in a fetal position was particularly heart-breaking. It takes some acting talent to make people laugh by keeping natural, and as a kid stuck in an adult body, Hanks delivered one of the subtlest and finest comedic performances ever, rightfully earning him his first nomination to an Oscar in 1989. I used to love a movie dealing with the same themes, ""Like Father Like Son"" when Dudley Moore and his teenage son played by Kirk Cameron exchanged their bodies, yet, unlike ""Big"", it fell into the trap of overacting when Moore played his role as if he was a ten-year-old boy.""Big"" works better because it doesn't overuse the fantastic element which only serves for the set-up. Like in ""Groundhog Day"", we never know the reason of the time loop phenomenon, in ""Big"", and we don't need to know, it's all about how a kid would live his life if he was stuck in a grown-up body, a very simple and original plot device that would pave the way to a series of extremely funny situations. And with such a ""Big"" idea on hands, the writers did the best without dealing with too much adult material, it's all about the situations that would lead him to get a job in a toys company, to be regarded as a goldmine for bright ideas, and seen with eyes of admiration, from MacMillan, Robert Loggia as a lovable CEO, of temptation, by Susan (Elizabeth Perkins), the office slut who finally found something 'special' in Josh, and eyes of jealousy by Paul, who sees in him, a dangerous competitor.The condition of Josh provides nice cinematic touches and memorable situations, among them the famous walking piano scene with Loggia, Josh insisting to be on 'the top' during his sleepover with Susan. And gradually, as the story evolves more confidently, it seems to inhabit its own maturation process, the clues about Josh's age cease to be as obvious, we don't need to see his house full of toys, his relationship with Billy, his best friend, Tom Hanks carries the film and there are some part where hints of childhood are betrayed by looks or smiles, his reaction to Susan's indirect declaration of love is the highlight of Hank's performance, he was perfect at that moment.The third act carries all the tenderness and poignancy that redeem the little moments where the film gets too stereotypical, we see a mother missing her child, we see a grown man who doesn't want to play anymore, he looks serious with his necktie and costume, but something in his heart is desperately missing his childhood. And this is what Penny Marshall, and the Oscar nominated script of Gary Ross and Anne Spielberg has a message to say. Childhood is a treasure to cherish especially in our cynical days, where kids get familiarized with death, sex and violence too early. ""Big"" stands for value that takes us back to a specific era to which we spend most time trying to get over and the rest of our lives wishing to live again. This is Josh' lesson.""Big"" is more than a charming family film, it's also a heart-warming reverse coming-of-age story with an undeniable nostalgic value, it reminds us of the magic of childhood, of the good old 80's that provided some endearing classic fantasy films such as ""Big"", ""The Princess Bride"" or ""Stand by Me"", and it reminded of this time where Tom Hanks wasn't Forrest Gump yet, when he had this funny face with curly hair and defined the family comedy of the 80's.",Big
30,ThomasDrufke,The Inner-Kid in All of Us,7,23 April 2019,"If I'm not mistaken this was the first movie to do the whole 'out of place age thing' with 13 Going on 30, 17 again, and now Shazam following, and there's no denying the influence it had on those films (even if the comic-book of Shazam/formerly Captain Marvel ultimately came first). I will say that being that the film is over 30 years old, it does have some dated elements. The most obvious being that it's implied Tom Hanks character (who is technically only a young teenager) sleeps with a grown woman. The relationship is a mostly innocent and touching one, but moments like that didn't necessarily age that well. It's also curious how little of an investigation there is into Josh's disappearance and presumed 'kidnapping'. But putting all that aside, 'Big' is an entertaining and heartfelt story about keeping your inner kid through adulthood, and never forgetting the things that should be important in life.7.7/10",Big
31,g-bodyl,Very Sweet and Charming!,9,23 July 2014,"Big is a great film, or more accurately a magical film. This is a movie that will bring out your inner child and make you giddy and happy. This is also a showcase of Tom Hank's talent to the studios and this is only the beginning to the monstrous next decade he is going to have. This film is sweet, romantic, and very charming. I think because mainly it goes through the thoughts every child has at some point and that is growing up to be adults and thus, that makes this film very relatable.Penny Marshall's film is about a boy named Josh Baskin who makes a wish at a carnival that he wants to be an adult. The very next day, Josh finds out his wish has been granted, but he is a 30-year-old with a 12-year-old mind. Things are smooth sailing at first, but once Josh goes through the drudgery of adulthood, maybe his wish wasn't the greatest thing after all.As said previously, Tom Hanks does an excellent job here. He has the kind of personality to successfully pull off this role. He is funny and amusing, especially acting as a 12-year-old. My favorite scene is when he was performing ""Heart & Soul"" with Robert Loggia on the piano at the toy store. Elizabeth Perkins does a pretty good job as Josh's adult love interest. John Heard is rather slimy as Josh's rival, and Robert Loggia was excellent as Josh's boss.Overall, Big is a sweet and light-hearted comedy that turns out to be one of the better comedies of the 1980's. There have been many kinds of film featuring a similar plot, but none better than this film. This was effectively carried by Tom Hanks and no one else could have done better.

In his first big hit, Hanks does a good job of conveying the inner child. His reactions to romantic overtures from Perkins provide most of the laughs. While it's hard to quibble with the plot logic of a film where a boy is transformed into a man overnight, it is a bit of a stretch that Hanks gets a job as a computer programmer days after his transformation and becomes a corporate vice president within a week.

37,zkonedog,Tom Hanks's Exuberance Makes This Film A Classic,8,12 March 2017,"Every child ever born on this earth, at some point in his/her life, wants to experience life as a grown-up before their time. Well, this comical little film shows what would happen if one of those children were to get their wish.For a short synopsis, this film tells the story of a 13-year old boy, Josh, who loses the ""girl of his dreams"" due to his short stature and lack of adult characteristics (such as driving). So, in a moment of self-pity, Josh makes a wish on a carnival game machine that he wants to be ""big"". The next morning, Josh wakes up with is 13-year old mind in the body of a 30-year old, and hilarity (and some emotional drama) ensues for the rest of the film.Tom Hanks, one of the few truly great actors of our day, plays the ""old Josh"", and really does carry this film in what turned out to be the start of his brilliant leading-role career. Hanks absolutely nails the silliness and mannerisms of a young teenager, which makes for some hilarious physical and situational comedy. Plus, the script is also very conducive to his acting, as the plot feeds into the mentality of a child (I mean, what could have possibly been a better job for the old Josh than Toy Tester?!). Whether Hanks is failing to convince his mother that, at heart, he is still 13, goofing around with his best buddy, or trying to maintain an adult romantic relationship, Hanks is brilliant in every nuance of the character.A particularly touching scene comes towards the end of the film, when the Old Josh must decide whether he wants to revert back to childhood. As he walks through his old neighborhood, he observes the simple moments that make childhood great, such as playing in a pile of leaves, a junior-high class picture, or starting a pick-up baseball game. I'll leave you in suspense as to what Old Josh decides to do, but suffice it to say that the scene will have you wondering whether you would have made the same choice.I don't consider this film to be one of my all-time favorites, thus the 4-star rating instead of five, but it is a very engaging little film that can be enjoyed by pretty much all ages. Children will love Hanks' crazy antics, while adults will appreciate Hanks' performance and be drawn into the conundrum he ultimately faces.",Big

This fair machine, similar to one of those fair fortune tellers, grants him the wish and, in fact, the next day, he appears to be at least thirty years old and has to run away from home because his own mother doesn't recognize him and calls the police.Okay, I recognize that the script is very childish and has lots of holes if we start thinking about it. One of the biggest, and most difficult to miss, is the strange way in which the young man, now unusually grown up, succeeds in managing his ""disappearance"" with his mother. It just doesn't make sense and it was something that could have been more explored by the script: uprooting, homesickness, having to move and being independent without being prepared for it. But the script didn't want to reach that depth and I understand the reasons: it steals the funny, gaves it more drama and this film, after all, is a comedy. It's all right. It is quite good as it is!Tom Hanks has, in this film, one of several comedies with which he started his cinema career after some very successful TV sitcoms, such as ""Family Ties"". He is still quite raw as an actor but, in this film, we already have signs of his talent, his charisma, qualities that opened doors for him, after all. He takes the film well, carries it with him until the end and shines, making the audience laugh without losing quality in the most emotional moments. Beside him, we have a capable cast, where we can mention Elizabeth Perkins, Robert Loggia and also the young Jared Rushton. The role of the villain, perhaps the least well thought out and most poorly conceived in this film, is up to John Heard.In addition to a well thought out and developed story, with creative goofs and jokes, and a good performance by Hanks and the cast that surrounds him, we can mention a very competent cinematography, although within the standards of that time, an elegant but discreet soundtrack and a simple and straightforward direction.Made to entertain, to make us laugh, this family movie is quite fun and very suitable, even today, for a family evening. Personally, I think its one of the happiest and best made comedies of the 80s. So much so that, from time to time, it still takes place on the television grid of speciality TV channels and continues to conquer new admirers, over thirty years after its debut. There is no better prize than this, I think.",Big

This in turn lets him play with all the toys in the company as their advisor on the quality of the playthings. Along the way he meets a woman who falls for his child like persona, but, of course, he can relate to her only as a child.

43,Anonymous_Maxine,One of the earlier in Tom Hanks's growing list of great films.,10,5 July 2001,"Big is just one of those movies that everyone has fond memories from. There is something here for everyone, and not just because of the fact that the target audience is so wide, but because kids will love to see their wishes about being an adult acted out on screen, and adults are likely to see Tom doing all the fun things that they remember hoping to never stop doing when they were kids themselves. Kids are sure to love it because they get to see what it would be like if a kid were able to suddenly become an adult (yes, I realize that exact reality is not portrayed in the movie, just humor me here), and adults will love it because no matter what age you are, it's just fun to act like a kid.In the 80s, Tom Hanks starred in some films that all seem to blend together, especially now that they are so overshadowed by the striking number of cinematic juggernauts that he has been in in the 90s, but Big is definitely one of the best of his earlier films, followed closely by the endlessly hilarious Money Pit. Everything was just done really well and with a lot of love in Big. (spoilers) The story is well written, Tom's performance is excellent as always, as are the performances of all of the other actors, that fortune granting machine at the carnival was wonderfully creepy, the adventures of a young boy trapped in an adult's body were fun and creative and entertaining, even the love story was fit well into the story and the film was never compromised in order to accomodate it. It would have been catastrophic for the film as a whole if Tom had remained an adult just to perpetuate the romance.
The whole point of the movie is to show the importance of childhood. First of all, there is the fact that Josh (Hanks) eventually learns that he has missed so much by just immediately becoming an adult, but there is also the fact that he has so much fun even when he is an adult. The movie is trying to teach people that childhood doesn't end with the end of adolescence or the accumulation of responsibility that comes with increasing age. Sure, you can't be a kid forever, but a lot of times you just need to lighten up and laugh at the world. Get a trampoline and a  bunch of Physioballs in your studio apartment! Play with the toys at the toy store! That's what that gigantic piano was put there for! Who cares if people give you funny looks? Those people are the ones who gave up on having fun when they moved out of their parents house. I think it was Seal who said that we're never gonna survive unless we get a little crazy. Well, Big is suggesting that we're never gonna survive if we take everything so seriously all the time. And quite frankly, it's hard to imagine that that could possibly not be true. Have fun in life.",Big

I don't know why but its where(spoiler alert)Josh goes back being a child again and he tells Perkin's charcther that he won't forget about her and you see him going back to being a 13 year old again.

For Josh(Tom Hanks) it's a challenge he'll never forget. When he was just a young man, he encounters a wishing machine, and boy did it come true. Sometimes it good to have what you want, for a day, for Josh, it was more challenging than he ever dreamed of. Alone in New York, relying on his friend to know how to survive on your own. When he meets Susan(Elizabeth Perkins), things went for the way he'll never forget. They have a good time together, going out for food, enjoying a dance. And the scene where she really opens up to him, man my heart skipped a beat or two. Being an adult is no different from being a young man, you can have fun at any age.

It's a super-simple, overdone formula that somehow works marvelously in spite of its shortcomings. As an audience, we're asked to sweep a lot under the rug while the plot runs its course, but because the production has so much heart, passion and genuine innocence, it's bafflingly easy to let go and enjoy the ride. Tom Hanks is to thank for a great big chunk of that, precisely nailing the mannerisms, facial ticks and naivete of a six-foot child playing in a grown-up's world. It's a major step forward for his career, which had been quagmired in slapstick and melodrama up to this point, and he runs away with the opportunity. The story is sweet, silly and earnest, fun as a fish-out-of-water comedy but also loaded with an armload of deeper meanings - a great reminder of how silly we act throughout our lives, both as children and as adults. It's impossible not to smile when Hanks and Robert Loggia play a duet on that giant Macy's foot-piano, even if the scene's been played to death ever since. Really, really good stuff that stands the test of time.",Big
49,snoozejonc,Excellent childhood perspective on life,9,25 June 2021,"A thirteen year old boy makes a wish to be big.This is one of the most charming and heartfelt movies that owes a lot to a simple story and a memorable performance by Tom Hanks.It is not the first movie with a body swap formula, but how the circumstance comes to pass for Josh Baskin is a superb fairytale concept, albeit with some minor plot holes.The brilliance of 'Big' is that it does not just use the concept as a gimmick to present a stream of fish out of water gags, it actually depicts the adult world from the perspective of a pubescent child. Josh plausibly interacts with the people as a thirteen year old would. This produces moments that are funny, touching, insightful and very memorable.My favourite parts are the scenes where he does not understand the overly complicated nuances of adult behaviour such as the ""what are we doing"" conversation with Susan and the office politics he inadvertently walks into with the antagonistic character Paul.I also love the best friend time he spends with Billy, who is an important character and catalyst for much of the plot and character development in the movie.The themes of the movie I enjoy the most come when it contrasts adulthood with childhood. Initially we see the pressures of early teenage life and a character who yearns to get big quickly and suffers the ironic consequences of not being careful about what he wishes. His adventure shows aspects of the real 'grownup' world that lack the innocence and simplicity of childhood, however he approaches everything with the most beautiful and sincere innocence. Thirteen is the perfect age for him to be in this story, as it is an age where he has begun the transformation into adulthood but is not (and should not be) fully there.The only aspect of the story I found a bit lacking was the whole kidnap angle played with his family. There are ways this could have played out differently but it does not spoil the enjoyment of the film at all for me.Visually it is very effective, with cinematography and editing that tells the story. You do not need to be told they are best friends, you know it from the images presented in the opening scenes. What happens at the fairground needs no explanation as it is so well captured. Josh's transformation and reaction are perfectly depicted. The Zoltar Speaks fortune telling machine is rightly a movie icon. Lots of visual sequences are enhanced by a great soundtrack.All performances are great particularly Elizabeth Perkins and John Heard as the most prominent adult characters. Robert Loggia is very likeable as the owner of a toy company.David Moscow is good as the young Josh, but Jared Rushton is superb as Billy, playing the strong, loyal and fun-loving best friend we all wish we had when we were thirteen. He has some of the best lines of the script and delivers them perfectly.'Big' is a showcase for the powerful screen presence and talent of Tom Hanks. Like a more modern equivalent of James Stewart, he embodies the electric charisma and boyish charm required for the role. His range for both comedy and drama excels in numerous scenes and above everything you believe he is that child trapped in a man's body.",Big

53,vertigo_14,Zoltar says your wish is granted.,10,5 April 2004,"I often wonder why it's so damn hard to just be a big kid no matter how old you are. Big is a movie about hanging on to that carefree child even when you grow up. It's about not getting caught up in stringent rules and routines, remembering those things that made being young so great, the outlook on life, especially when facing the mundane world of adulthood. Big strikes the balance between the two.This is one of those movies that nearly everyone has seen. And, I suppose it's the precursor to that movie, 13 Going on 30, despite some differences in how the metamorphosis occurs and the result and everything.Big is the story of 13 year-old Josh Baskin who is tired of missing out on all the privileges of being an adult. He's tired of simply being a kid. One night, he makes a drastic wish at a carnival arcade machine, and in the next day, he wakes up 30 years-old (or so). So the kid gets his wish, and while trying to return to normal, is a 13 year-old kid faced with a 30-year old's responsibilities. And it's a lot of fun. He works at a toy manufacturer. He gets the most excellent loft. I remember wanting a place like that when I was a teenager. Eventually, the 13-year-old must balance with the responsibilities of being a 30 year-old when Josh falls seriously in love with Susan (Perkins). Big is one of the greatest movies ever simply because of the idea of a kid trying to be an adult and an adult still trying to hang on to being a kid, and all that things that Josh Baskins gets to experience while doing that.As one of Penny Marshall's most notable production, this is enjoyable for nearly any age group. Everyone in it is fantastic--Hanks, Perkins, Loggia, Heard, Rheul, Moscow, and Rushton. It's a tough thing trying to hang to being young when you get older, but Big's a good reminder to keep trying.",Big

I do not like this type of movie(I didn't like Home Alone for example) and would not have thought I'd get into this but I did. I've only seen this once and found it mildly enjoyable and very sweet. It is a great movie for the family and much fun to see an early Tom Hanks. In spite of that I didn't love it and it isn't one I have any strong desire to see again.

The premise of aging very quickly hasn't been copied very much, this is the benchmark for any funny movie about a wish being made and coming true. Everything since this like from Freaky Friday (though it is a 70's remake) to Liar Liar have all been influenced by this to be as good.12-year-old Josh Baskin (David Moscow) is tired of being to young or too small to do things he wants. After constantly being rejected at a carnival, he makes a wish from a Zoltar machine to be big. He miraculously wakes up the next day twenty years older (Tom Hanks). With help from his best friend (Jared Rushton), Josh tries to lay low from people he knows for a while and gets a job at a toy company where he becomes an instant success and falls in love with his coworker (Elizabeth Perkins). Like any other movie of its kind, the kid at first finds it fun to be where he's at, then realizes he belongs where he started. But this has the magic, originality, and fun that no other movie of its kind has.In a tour-de-force for Tom Hanks, he does my favourite role of his. Forrest Gump may be his best role, but this is my favourite. They way he plays a kid in a man's body really shows great acting that only the best can play. This is a comedy, but this is one of the few kinds of comedic roles that are hard to play. He is an innocent kid who doesn't get any sexual references and just wants to have fun. Hanks gives 1988's second best role (after Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man) but Hanks in this is perhaps more timeless.3.5/4",Big

This film not only ""holds up"" well, it is still a timeless classic. Hanks & Perkins give outstanding performances; instead of ""playing"" a 12 year old, Hanks actually becomes one. His innocence is totally believable. Perkins plays the part of the ambitious Susan to perfection, and she is the perfect love interest for Hanks. Talk about chemistry here! The acting was great and the entire cast did an superb job. The movie is definitely a feel-good piece, but it's more than just fluff. If you think about some of the messages, it's telling us just to take things at face value and enjoy life. Josh succeeds because he has no ulterior motives. We are regularly reminded about the importance of friendship, and how events in our lives can sometimes threaten our relationships with established friends when we find something or someone new that we think deserves our full attention. Of course, a good friend will forgive you for such indulgences.Overall, the movie deserves more stars for it's clever laughs, amazing acting, magnitude of imagination and nostalgia. Nonetheless, when the ending came along, I was left in shock wondering what just happened. Is that it? What happens next? There has to be additional footage. It cannot end like this.

Funny, poignant film takes an overworn high-concept premise (heck, there were almost a half-dozen kid-to-adult movies released within a couple years before and after this one) and makes it fresh again on the basis of clever dialogue and a terrific showcase for Hanks, just about perfect as the man-child struggling to fit in with the adult world. He's matched by a top-notch supporting cast, including likable Loggia, hostile Heard, and Rushton as the best bud. Script is full of real-world-implication holes (the false kidnapping sub-plot is uncomfortable, to say the least), and most adults would agree that a wish-granting arcade machine is only, like, the fourth most improbable element of the story, but it's hard to care about any of that stuff in the moment.

62,Sergeant_Tibbs,Very 80s charm.,7,10 July 2013,"One of those campy 80s ""classics"" I'd never seen and kind of wish I did during my childhood. As expected, Tom Hanks is really great and charming. He captures the childlikeness very well, although somewhat inconsistently as sometimes he seemed even younger than 12, but then it is hard to gauge properly. It is a frequently amusing and heartwarming film with famous movie magic moments that still work such as the piano scene and the scene where he reverts back to a child.The plot flowed too almost too smoothly however, never touching the peaks of its potential even with its blatant family friendly limitations, highlighted by the dark implications that are hard to ignore - such as him being a missing child and the pedophilia of him being in a relationship with Elizabeth Perkins (who I couldn't not picture as Wilma Flintstone when I realised who she was, the only other film I've seen her from). It follows the 80s structure of approaching a concept then having a series of chronological inconsequential capers not really building to something big until it ends with everything back to normal. It's charming refreshing entertainment nonetheless and worth watching.7/10",Big

It works because people of both sexes should be able to remember what it was like to be on the threshold of finally growing up, and yet somehow your innocent mind cannot understand why the privileges of adulthood are still being withheld from you. It could be the simple pleasure of being allowed onto a scary carnival ride, and yet the wait just to grow that couple of inches taller seems agonising when you're a youngster and it's your greatest wish in the world. Then, in a few years, when you have the height and the independent wealth but can't escape the responsibility that goes with it, chances are you'll be yearning to travel back in time... ! The selective memory of the mind can play tricks on you, I guess.""Big"" is a film that should be a joy to watch for both kids and adults alike, because both camps will relate to the two worlds shown in very different ways. No matter the passage of time since 1988, even as an adult I still think a charmed 'Zoltar' machine would be a pretty neat thing to lay claim to! However I can also better appreciate these days the significance of the two different levels with the bunk-bed decision...The biggest lesson that can be drawn from all of this is to never let go of your sense of fun. In some ways I'm still very much an overgrown kid at heart, so I can relate to that, and I hope my attitude never changes until the day I die, too.",Big
64,KUAlum26,Tom Hanks' career turning point?,9,20 December 2006,"Actually one(maybe even myself)would probably say that the films that put Mr.Hanks on the map as a serious actor were either Nothing in Common(with JAckie Gleason,in Mr.Gleason's last role) or Punchline(with SAlly Field,John Goodman and a host of comics). But as far as watershed,landmark roles,this one set him off toward where he is today.Thirteen-year old Josh Baskin(David Moscow) is like most junior-high-schoolers his age:undersized,lacking confidence and feeling like something or things are in his way in terms of getting respect and/or the attention of the opposite sex. When,at Coney Island,he makes a wish to a Fortune Teller machine that he wishes to be big,he awakes to find that his wish has come true,in a way he was most certainly NOT prepared for.From there,he struggles to function as a tweener in the body of an adult version of himself. He eventually finds shelter and even finds work in(guess what?)a toy-making corporation,headed by a crusty but warm older exec(Robert Loggia)who takes a liking to this strange ""man""named Josh. At the job,he meets and bonds with a pretty but business-like superior(?)(Elizabeth Perkins,who's underrated here)and is vexxed by her boyfriend,a venal 80s-type go-getter(John Heard). All the while JOsh holds out hope,with the help of his best pal Billy(Jared Rushton),of finding the Fortune Teller machine to return him to the age he truly belongs.From a script co-written by GAry Ross and Anne Spielberg(hmm),director Penny Marhsall(who at the time was still largely known as either Laverne from ""Laverne and Shirley"" or as Rob Reiner's ex),wisely lets this story play as a mostly physical obstacle course of having the main character have to make the unwieldy jump of going from thirteen to(let's say)thirty-one. The gags are mostly pure and the chemistry feels natural. I first saw this in the theater in July,1988. I was sixteen at the time,and so adolescence was still a very fresh memory to me. This film got to me in ways I wasn't sure I would be(previously that year,there were two other films to my knowing,18 Again and Vice-Versa,that had similar subject matter,only in those,an actual ""switch""was made between an adult and a youngster.In those films,it felt like the joke was meant to be played more for winking effect than honest discombobulation). Here was a gentle and wise film that showed that one who believes that being older,bigger,taler,etc. isn't always the blessing it appears to be.This was,I believe Mr.Hanks' first Oscar(and maybe other awards)nomination,and it would be fair to say that this film probably first truly elevated his career(and the career of Miss Marshall to a lesser effect)to the status it has gone on to be.",Big
65,oneguyrambling,Tom Hanks shines in a definitive 80s comedy.,9,24 September 2011,"This is based upon the Extended version, so I guess that makes this Big-ger? Big is a brilliant example of the right guy in the right role. I think Big was always going to end up OK, but with Tom Hanks as Josh Baskin; the child in an adult's body, it ascended to all time greatness.As mentioned above 13 year old Josh Baskin makes a wish at a fairground on an old attraction named 'Zoltar', that results in him aging two decades or so overnight – Charlie Sheen seems to have made the same wish judging by his recent photos – but in Josh's case being a teen 30 something isn't that easy. How did the 90210 kids manage to pull it off? His parents obviously don't understand how the rosy cheeked boy vanished and why the rosy cheeked Tom Hanks type ended up in their living room so they call in a kidnapping and the cops show to pick up the trail. The only person who knows Josh's true identity is his still 13 year old friend Billy, an obnoxious boy with poor judgment.You know, the Lindsay Lohan type 'what she's in her 20s!'.Now expected to be a contributing member of society even though he still wants to play with toys, collect baseball cards and peek at girls (even when he hasn't the first idea what to do with them), Josh moves to New York and takes a room at a seedy inner city hotel. But staying there long enough to track down the Zoltar machine requires money, so Josh gets a job at a toy store. Awesome. Though it must be said it is in the IT department not the actual store.Once in New York and getting' paid Josh indulges in the things every teen would when given incredible riches – $187! – pizza, toys and novelties. His 'youthful' exuberance and upbeat attitude bring him to the attention of several in his new workplace, the boss (Robert Loggia), the aggressive businesswoman with aspirations of climbing the ladder Susan (Elizabeth Perkins) and her male counterpart and current squeeze Paul (John Heard). (Also worthy of note is a brief role played with smarmy brilliance by the hilarious John Lovitz, who only wants Josh to slow down so he doesn't have to try harder.) Of course Josh is promoted to some sort of executive role as a 'toy tester and developer', a role that he is uniquely suited to and attacks with gusto. His newfound promotion is accompanied by a new bigger salary – Josh moves into a plush apartment furnished with décor a kid would choose if they had Dakota Fanning's change purse – and more attention from Susan.Now a little more content and settled into this 'easy being an adult' thing, Josh seems to forget his recent past, including Billy and his family.Will he forego his teens and twenties and fast-track his way to middle age, or will he find a way back to his bunk bed and pet hamster? Hanks' performance carries the film, you can really believe at times that he is a trapped kid, and there are frequent reminders of his 12-ness in any case that are both charming and hilarious – a scene in the toy store between Josh and the boss stands out instantly.The new extended cut includes a heap of previously unseen stuff that I think was wisely cut, mainly depressing and negative things that would bring what should remain a buoyant film down. Let's just say there are enough examples of how hard it is to be a young boy trapped in an adult world without being shown that Billy grew up in an abusive household There are funnier films from the 80s (Coming to America), there are more memorable comedies from the 80s (Back to the Future, ET) but there are no films more charming and likable from the 80s. Big announced Tom Hanks as a genuine actor and not a hammy Ferrell wannabe (even though Ferrell didn't exist yet). The following few years saw him become the most bankable leading man in comedy, the years after that saw him take home his Oscars – as in plural – nothing I have seen since suggests that he is any less funny or any less talented than he was in 1988 when Big was released.But even with the Oscars, the paydays and the universal acceptance there hasn't been a role so tailor-made for Hanks since Josh Baskin. Anyone else in the role might have seen it work, but Hanks made Big truly great.Final Rating – 8.5 / 10. The extended edition is no upgrade, get the original Big, the one that doesn't remind you how crap it can be to be an adult and instead focuses on how cool it can (and should) be to be a kid...",Big

Tome Hanks garned a well deseverd oscar nod for and Penny Marshall proved she was a good director and this is still one my favorite Penny films.

68,rupie,"might enter the ""classic"" category",8,30 October 2000,"Saw this movie again recently and found that it stands up well to repeat viewings. Tom Hanks meets a difficult challenge here - to convincingly show us how a twelve-year old boy would act if he were trapped in an adult's body and had to ""pass"" in a grownup world. He meets the challenge in spades, aided by a script that is by turns witty, clever, insightful, and touching, and by Penny Marshall's able direction. Much is added by Robert Loggia's sympathetic portrayal of Tom/Josh's boss, and by Jared Rushton as his friend Billy. The movie is much more than an exercise in slapstick or farce: it is really a disquisition on the wonder of childhood. In the end it is quite touching, if not moving, reminding us all of the innocence of youth and the aching sadness of recalling its loss. Too early to tell, but the film might very well be destined to become a classic.",Big
69,Stampsfightclub,A great and enjoyable family film,9,2 March 2008,"In his first Oscar nominated role, Tom Hanks (Forrest Gump) gives an outstanding performance as teenager Josh who makes a wish on a fair ground machine to be big. The next morning, Josh wakes up to find his wish has come true.Director Penny Marshall's second film is a wonderful tale about the differences between teenage life and the grown up world with Hanks a catalyst in perhaps his best ever role.The film contains many typical elements of both the young and the old world. From playing computer games at home to organizing promotion meetings, Big truly captures how life can transform quickly; just overnight for some of us (which was a brilliant idea to capture the true meaning of growing up).It's a very good natured comedy and some very clever jokes are encoded to justify the genre beautifully.There are some good feel moments, watch the piano scene in the toy store, comedy and enjoyment at its very best.Jared Rushton (Honey, I shrunk the kids) has a marvellous role as Josh's best friend. Their song is really heart warming and humorous and the adventures they have together are great fun and epitomize childhood.But its Hanks who steals centre sage with his dedicated performance as Josh. On build up to the film, he followed David Moscow around, who played young Josh, to see how he acted in real life and portrayed his actions in the film, a wonderful achievement and a great role.Though the film follows a few clichés towards the end it is one of the best family comedies ever made.",Big

71,TOMASBBloodhound,"Funny, enjoyable film until it gets too serious.",6,19 February 2012,"They sure made a few of these kind of movies back in the late 1980s, didn't they? Even one with George Burns moving into a younger body! I guess Big and the one with Kirk Cameron and Dudley Moore were the only two I actually saw. Big is certainly a cut above that film, but with this gimmick as your main storyline, there is definitely a ceiling for just how good your movie can be. Tom Hanks plays Josh Baskin, a young man teetering on the edge of puberty who makes a wish that he simply become ""big"". He does this to some sort of oddball carnival game that tells him ""his wish has been granted"". Strange, because the kid looks down and notices that the machine was not even plugged in. The next morning, Josh Baskin wakes up as Tom Hanks, and we are off and running.Big is generally a funny film. Hanks does very well trying to imitate the mannerisms of a twelve year old boy, and his antics make for some rather funny and amusing situations. Of course he and his buddy set out to find the machine, which has conveniently been removed to another location, so they can switch him back to his old self. This being back in the 80s, it was apparently a large-scale ordeal to track a carnival machine as you could not simply look it up on the internet or any other useful solution that could wrap things up quickly. Hanks and his little pal learn they will not be able to find the machine for several weeks. Hanks will thus be forced to find a job and live as an adult until that information can be mailed to them. Sound ridiculous? Of course it does, but in any logical world we couldn't have this plot anyway. Hanks ends up getting a job at a toy firm where his childish perspective on what makes a fun toy has him quickly moving up the corporate ladder. He even endears himself to the owner played quite well by the ever-reliable Robert Loggia. Complications, and some genuine laughs occur, when Hanks begins to strike up a relationship with a female exec at the company played by Liz Perkins. Initially it is quite funny to see her come onto him, and he being just a child having no clue how to respond. Then Hanks seems to hit puberty, and the film veers off in a mostly serious direction, and the last 20 minutes or so just aren't funny or satisfying.If they had maybe just kept things lighter in terms of tone and plot, this could have been a better film. It certainly is not a bad one, but a re-write or two could have helped it. Its just a little off-putting seeing Hanks awkwardly touch Perkins's breast for the first time. Just kind of creepy thinking a boy that mentally young would have his first experience with an adult woman who clearly wants to jump his bones. You'd think a boy in his shoes would have done everything he could to explain to his mother where he was, and what happened. But when you have a plot like this, reasonable action couldn't coincide. Big is a decent film. And some scenes are classic. One day, an old person like Robert Osborne is going to refer to the dancing piano scene as ""movie magic"". And he will be right. 6 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Big
72,gab-14712,One of My Favorite Films of 1988!,10,17 October 2021,"Tom Hank's Big is one of my favorite films of 1988. It is a poignant film that will make you laugh, cry, and want to see many times. It is one of those features that is rewatchable. This magical adventure is about your inner child and how you should never, ever lose it no matter how old you are. For a film that is more than thirty years old, it is a tale that is more relatable than ever especially as we live in a world that grows more cynical by the day. In lesser hands, this film probably would not have worked. But, Tom Hanks was able to sell his childlike demeanor into something that will inspire people for all ages to come. On top of that, he is a mighty fine dancer (yes, I am referring to the famous FAO Schwartz piano dance).Penny Marshall directed the film, and a fun trivia fact is that her film became the first one directed by a female director to gross more than a hundred million dollars at the box office. Well deserved too. It was not always going to be that way. Steven Spielberg was originally attached to direct the movie but had to leave the project with the birth of his son. I do not know how the story would have turned out, but the film almost starred Robert De Niro. He is a fantastic actor, but he does not have the ""skillset"" for this type of movie...unlike everyone's favorite American actor, Tom Hanks.Josh Baskin is a twelve-year-old kid who is always tired of being pushed around. He has the dream to become an adult. His dream becomes true when he runs into a fortune-telling machine named Zoltar. After making his wish, he wakes up in the body of a thirty-year-old (played by Hanks). Josh quickly learns that being an adult is not all that easy. He needs to find a job, which he does as a data entry clerk at a toy company. He impresses the owner, MacMillan (Robert Loggia) with his toy insight. He quickly earns a promotion. He also gets the attention of fellow executive, Susan (Elizabeth Perkins) and her jealous boyfriend, Paul (John Heard). With Josh, who's soul is still a child, will he forget what it is like to be a child?The performances are nothing short of excellent. I mentioned how Hanks was able to sell the childlike innocence despite being an adult. For all the poignancy, there is plenty of comedy. The scene where Josh and Susan have a 'sleepover"" had me in hysterics. Josh's rivalry with Paul is also really funny. Both Perkins and Heard delivered stupendous performances with their adult minds barely able to comprehend Josh's child-like qualities. Finally, there is lots of heart. Hanks and Loggia played off each other so well. This is the scene everyone remembers, but the film's heart is on display when the two men are dancing to ""Heart and Soul"" and ""Chopsticks"" on the piano. Finally, the child actors were believable in their respective roles. Jared Rushton as Josh's friend Billy and David Moscow as young Josh made you believe they were truly friends.Overall, I loved Big. It is funny, smart, and charming. It was released during a time where age-swapping comedies were being released by the dozen it seems. It, and many others may have been influenced by the 1987 Italian comedy La Grande, but it does not hold a candle to what is onscreen here. The script from Anne Spielberg and Gary Ross managed the right tone, Penny Marshall proved her deft directorial skills, we all know about Hanks and the rest of the cast, and Howard Shore also created a simple, but memorable score. This is the reason why we go to the movies. To see relatable films that one will never forget. I have seen this film so many times and I still love it every single time.My Grade: A+",Big
73,SmileysWorld,An early glimpse of genius.,9,2 January 2006,"If you are like me,and if you saw this film when it was brand new,you could just tell by watching Tom Hanks in his role as the ""big"" Josh Baskin,that he was destined for an Oscar or two,and sure enough,we were right,because he won two back to back statues just a few short years later.In fact,personally,I am not so sure he did not deserve to take one home for this film.Who else but Tom Hanks could pull off playing a twelve year old boy trapped in a thirty year old body?His performance here is nothing short of genius,and is a delight to watch,as is the film itself with it's outstanding story line and excellent direction by Penny Marshall,who apparently knows just how to bring out that genius,as this is not their only film together.Not to downplay the great supporting cast,but this is indeed Tom Hanks'film.

74,Animany94,A sweet story of appreciating childhood.,9,20 June 2019,"I remember watching ""Big"" when I was younger and finding it funny because of the out of place scenario of seeing a 12-year-old in a grown-up's body. But you'll actully get more out of this movie if you're an adult, because this movie is a sweet reminder of how the innocence of being a child can be the best thing in the world instead of constantly distancing yourself from it and just wanting to grow up.Tom Hanks does a wonderful job at portraying Josh as an adult after being transformed by a wishing machine. How he is confused by what the world expects of him, how his friend Billy always wants to help him, how he interacts with the adults in his everyday life, it's all both entertaining, engaging and pretty insightful.The best thing about this story is when he looks back at different children running around playing and having fun while he himself gets more into adult life and starts realizing how he can't do this, because he misses his family. It is those details that make it touching and make you think.The movie isn't flawless, though, because even though all these thoughtprovoking subjects of appreciating childhood are powerful, the movie's premise can be a curse too, because you're constantly aware of Josh's real age, and admittedly, I think the movie could've benefitted from a little more exposure to how Josh's family coped with his absence. If he was somehow unwillingly contacted or encountered more posters with ""have you seen this boy?"" on it. But just looking at the direction and the acting, this is a really good movie.I think the movie will eventually becaome a classic, because even though I find some elements questionable, it is a well excecuted story with good acting and a touching message.",Big
75,russem31,A classic.,9,29 August 2006,"""Big"" (1988) is another great film by director Penny Marshall in what I consider Tom Hanks' breakout role (this film also earned him his first Best Actor Oscar nomination). Hanks was the right actor to portray a 13 year old kid who grew up due to a wish via a fortune telling machine. You see Hanks pull off a youthful innocence even as an adult, which makes him a pleasure to watch. Coupled with his screen presence with both his adult co-star Elizabeth Perkins as Susan (their chemistry works really well in this film), and child co-star Jared Rushton as Billy. Also John Heard is hilarious as the uptight Paul whose childhood has definitely left the building long ago (the funniest moment is when he's playing outdoor racquetball with Hanks!).

77,EijnarAmadeus,Classic 80ties Family Comedy,8,6 August 2004,"spoilers. Tom Hanks does a fabulous performance in BIG, that's one of his most important career movies. BIG is a very charming comedy that plays on the easy notes of entertainment.Tom Hanks is Josh, a boy that keeps irritating over being only thirteen years old. So one day he wishes from a circus-box that he was an adult. Waking up the next day being a grown-up he panics and sets for New York where he can reach the magic-machine that fixed his wish. Here he soon gets to be a successful manager inside toys. He falls in love with a woman and his mother is going mad...BIG is a very organized and very fine movie. Hanks charming everyone in his fine role and the movie has captured one of the most magical moments of film history with Josh and his boss dancing piano in the middle of a toy-store. BIG is a great achievement of family comedy although it contains a Hanks-touching-breast scene it's totally clear for the family to watch. Being a typical 80ties movie it's all you want from such a movie too; - the rebell best friend, Converse shoes, baseball content, the high hair etc. Although I hated the 80ties. STARS: 4/5",Big
78,Mightyzebra,Not as some of your other reviewers say: it's lovely! :),8,6 March 2007,"This a funny, exciting film! It also stars Tom Hanks, who I think does really well as Josh.

On the same day, he finds a machine which supposedly ""grants"" him a wish. When Josh wakes up the next morning, it turns out his wish has come true...I really liked this film, as it is different from most things I've watched, it leaves fond memories and it keeps me on the edge of my seat at points. It is also very funny! I love the character of Josh.

79,Min111,He turns big,8,9 April 2021,"I'm not a fan of Tom Hanks even though he's famous for these many good movies we can remember from our heads. 'Big' was one of his good or very good movies. I just couldn't believe how entertaining and interesting the movie was. This is a movie for anyone. It doesn't matter if you're from the eighties or nineties. Tom Hanks is the main character named Josh who's practically a teenager. Josh inserts a coin into a fortune-telling machine, and he makes a wish which in the next morning came true. He wishes to become bigger. While making the wish, he receives a card stating his wish has been granted. John now finds himself as an adult. I liked the machine where Josh made his wish. The machine is called Zoltar. When Josh made his wish, the machine was unplugged the entire time which happen to spook him. I really liked the part where he tries to explain to his mother what happened. His mother refuses to listen. She even threatens him, and thinks the man (Josh) is a stranger who has kidnapped her son. I thought that entire part was very funny. Luckily, Josh has a friend named Billy where he convinces him of his identity by singing a rap which only they know. If you seen the movie, you can tell that Josh really needed Billy's help. Billy is my favourite character in the movie. Billy and Josh learn it will take quite a while to locate the Zoltar machine. Josh also tried finding the machine earlier, but he only saw an empty field. He realised the carnival on the night where he made his wish had moved on. Josh needs to find the Zoltar machine, so he can make his wish of becoming a kid again. I like how Josh rents a room, and gets a job. He's a data entry clerk. He even gets promoted. I also liked the part at his apartment where he fills the place with many items or things. I thought the stuff he had there was pretty cool - you need to see it. Yes, Josh is now big, but he still acts like a kid. Let's not forget another character named Susan. She's Josh's love interest. She works in the same company as Josh. I do feel the movie has romance even though it's entirely a comedy movie. Elizabeth Perkins as Susan was a good choice. Josh and Susan really liked each other. I thought it was romantic. Susan does find out in the end that Josh was telling the truth that he's really a kid. It was sad to see how Josh and Susan relationship was going to end. You can tell though Josh wants to go back being a kid. I rate the movie an eight which would make it very good, and higher than the overall rating on here.",Big

83,DavidSim240183,Arguably Tom Hanks' best performance.,10,1 March 2004,"Big is one of those charming, wistful tales that is completely timeless, and still manages to entertain audiences even 15 years after it was made. Nominated for Best Actor for 1988 (an Oscar he should have won really), Tom Hanks gives a brilliant performance in this fabulous fish out of water story. 12 year old Josh Baskin is a typical adolescent, obsessed with girls and shirks responsibility whenever he can. One night, when he goes to a carnival with his parents, he is embarrassed in front of a girl he has a crush on by being excluded from a fairground ride because he is too short.He comes across a machine called Zoltar at the carnival, where it apparently grants wishes. Josh makes a simple request, ""I wish I were big."" The next morning, when Josh wakes up, he finds to his amazement he has become a 35 year old man (Tom Hanks).With the carnival gone, and the Zoltar machine along with it, Josh must frantically try to track it down. But his own mother doesn't even recognise him, and assumes he kidnapped her son. The only person he can turn to is Billy, his best friend, (Jared Rushton, looking like a live action version of Bart Simpson). After convincing him it is Josh, the two head to New York, where Josh gets a job at a toy company as a computer operator. Until they can get an idea of where the Zoltar machine is, and Josh can wish himself back to being a child.Josh quickly manages to become an executive at the company after getting on the good side of the boss MacMillan (Robert Loggia) in a charming scene at the mall playing on a giant keyboard. His innocence and wisdom allow him to predict what toys children want, much to the anger of one of his co-workers Paul (John Heard). It also means one of the female executives Susan (Elizabeth Perkins) falls in love with him, because she is attracted to his innocence.Tom Hanks is perfectly suited to the role, because he brings with it a goofy charm that shows how Josh can't properly fathom the adult world even though he looks like an adult. He just sees the world through a child's eye, and tries to accept things in the best way he can. The film has many memorable moments (especially the keyboard scene) but Tom Hanks is what makes those scenes memorable. His gawky enthusiasm is greatly accessible, and rich in subtlety and nuance. He's got great chemistry with Elizabeth Perkins, and its funny because he can't quite grasp at first what it is she wants from their relationship. One of the funniest exchanges is when they go to his apartment which looks like a gigantic teenager's bedroom:(Susan) ""I mean I like you, and I want to spend the night with you."" (Josh) ""Do you mean sleep over?"" (Susan) ""Well, yeah."" (Josh) ""OK. But I get to be on top.""The fact he is talking about a bunk bed and their wires are seriously crossed is what makes that scene so funny. In some respects, the adult world has some connotations with the world Josh is used to. Paul is like a bully, and antagonises Josh every chance he gets. The scene where they're playing racquet ball is a prime example.Big arrayed a quite impressive number of up and coming talents, both in front of and behind the camera. As well as Penny Marshall in the directors chair, the screenplay is overseen by Anne Spielberg, sister of...well I think you know who, and Gary Ross, future director of the extremely underrated Pleasantville. Handling the cinematography is Barry Sonnenfeld, before he directed classics like Get Shorty and The Addams Family. Look out for future Simpsons writer James L. Brooks on the credits too!Wisely, the filmmakers steered clear of outright mawkishness and over sentimentality, and the audience isn't patronised by the material. There is something to appreciate no matter what age you are, although there are some scenes that may be unsuitable for young children, e.g. Josh's implied sex scene with Susan and one use of the F word.Big is still a lot of fun, and the ending is bittersweet when Josh must say goodbye to Susan. That scene right at the end always brings a smile to my face, and must certainly go down as one of the most endearing and magical scenes in cinema history.Big has withstood the test of time, and is far superior to Forrest Gump, another film about a simple man's place in history. Big has more charm, and doesn't manipulate you into liking it like Forrest Gump did. Big is a truly magical film, and Tom Hanks' career just went from strength to strength after that.In 20 years time, there will be legends about Big.",Big

85,roghache,Delightful comedy of an innocent kid in a man's body,8,18 March 2006,"This is a really fun, well acted comedy fantasy the whole family can enjoy. It sparkles mainly because of the stellar performance given by Tom Hanks in the role of the innocent kid who finds himself in the body of a 30 year old man, perceived by those around him (including women) as an adult, and confronted with a colleague who wants a relationship with him. He looks grown up but always very convincingly manages to act like a sort of goofy kid.The plot tells the fantastic tale of 12 year old Josh Baskin who, in front of a carnival magic machine, wishes he was BIG. In the morning, he wakes up to find himself in an adult body. Wanting to revert to his kid size, he travels with his friend to New York City, trying to find a machine to counteract the sudden aging. While there, he finds himself employed by a toy company, where he is prized by the execs for his uncanny ability to predict the toys kids will really like. Not only that, but a female executive, Susan, is attracted to this charming young 'man', mainly because of his innocence. Josh must learn to navigate this strange new adult world, all the while still thinking like a kid.Lots of laughs, especially of course when Susan starts making advances which the naive young Josh misinterprets. This film is all about the innocence of childhood, and realizing that we don't always really want, nor should we have, everything we wish for. Josh of course realizes that, while grown ups have their independence (and can get on the big rides at the fair), he's not yet ready for adult responsibilities and relationships, and doesn't want to miss out on all the experiences of the intervening years.Cute story, magnificent performance by Hanks, and a touching ending which I won't give away. It's an entertaining, light hearted film with a relevant message both for kids, who often wish to be 'all grown up', and also for adults, who sometimes nostalgically long for the fun of just being a kid again.",Big

It all starts with a kid who wishes he was big...and you get it, the next day he is a big and due to his child fantasy he gets an important job in the toyindustry... Ummm, hello are you still there???? You can tell this brings back the child in you and stuff like that, what it's all about is just a blank comedy with no jokes (unless you think Hanks playing with toys is funny) with a brilliant actor who acts just like he's still ten...but that's it...",Big

91,bobbobwhite,One of the best movies ever,10,7 July 2006,"Never have I enjoyed a movie more than Big, it was that good. Director Penny Marshall and Tom Hanks as Josh hit the mark exactly all the way through, and Jared Rushton was just too good as Josh's best friend. The end was so touching, just so right. Every kid's wish is to be big when he is 13, but this movie showed the downside to that wish and that at all times we are exactly the age we should be.But, what do I know, as after Big I just knew that Jared would be a big movie star. He did not become anything like that, and he is now out of the movie business and into a music career. After Big, he sure could not do any better so I guess it is best to go out on top.",Big
92,Dockelektro,Simpler but Greater,8,10 August 2001,"A true cult movie of my childhood and many others I believe, this movie is THE gem. From the most simpler of stories and settings comes the story of Josh, a 12-year-old who becomes big, as he makes a wish on a strange machine which isn't even connected to the power outlet. When the day after comes, the mayhem is, of course, hilarious, as Josh, in the body of a 25-or-so-year-old man tries to explain it to his mother, wear his clothes, and so on. And the film doesn't run off in just some gags about a kid being a man. This movie has poignancy, a great (oscar-nominated) perfomance by Hanks, great comedy moments and true feelings. I watched this one several times, I just couldn't get tired of it. A truly special movie, which is an example of how even the most apparently crazy premise can be given a proper treatment and become a movie for everyone to see.",Big
93,troyputland,Hanks at his best.,9,1 January 2016,"Big is the ultimate classic, feel-good, relaxing, stress-free movie. I literally cannot say a bad word about it Tom Hanks', in his early 30's, plays a 13 year old whose wish to be bigger is answered. Hanks is pure delight, capturing a young heart in an adult's form with ease. Big is outrageously funny, even when it's not trying to be, all thanks to Hanks. The idea of a boy becoming an adult overnight is a little odd, a tiny bit misconstrued, but never, ever, breaks my disbelief. The most beautiful point about Big is seeing a boy wish he was older, but wanting to keep his innocence at the same time. Stand out moments: when Hank's in a hotel room in the scary Big Apple, petrified of the noises around him, and another at a dinner party, testing out fanciful food. Priceless on all accounts.",Big
94,Mcduff3601,Ermm... this movie made me so uncomfortable,6,1 August 2018,"I remember watching this around the time it first came out and loving it. I remember the ending in particular and feeling sad, I remember watching the piano scene which is so iconic and thinking this is awesome. I remember watching big Josh and wishing I could be like him.I re-watched this because the wife and I were looking for something light and funny and we both remembered this movie vaguely as being both.I had a real problem with the casual pedophilia aspect of the movie, it overshadowed everything for me. It made scenes that were supposed to be touching or romantic just cringy. Times have changed I doubt this movie would get made these days, if it did it would have been an indie art house and not a main stream blockbuster. There was nothing wrong with anything else in this movie, acting was great, pacing was good. But I just couldn't get over the fact that we were watching a kid doing all these grown up things, including having sex with a 20-30 something? woman. Not too mention if the mom of Josh thinks he is kidnapped how come no police I mean the kid was gone for a month! I know the 80's were more chill but I am pretty sure if I had gone missing for a month back then my parents would have been out on the streets the whole time along with the cops. Anyway if you want a funny stupid Tom Hanks 80's movie The Bachelor Party is better - the sex in that one is less creepy.",Big
95,macpherr,Awesome movie!,9,14 November 2000,"Penny Marshall (Awakenings, The Preacher's Wife) has directed a few really good movies such as Big. I just love this movie.  ""Big"" has so many good ingredients because it deals with phantasy and really sweet reality.     Tom Hanks ( Forest Gump, Saving Private Ryan) is a wonderful actor. He deserves all the awards he has received.  I love his work. I was watching a tape of Tom s appearance,  on ""Inside the Actors Studio"" and the more I hear him talk the more I like him. He is a devoted husband to actress Rita Wilson, a good father and has a great sense of diplomacy. I have never seen Tom Hanks being critical of anybody. He is always looking at the positive side of things, besides that he has a self-deprecating sense of humor. He is funny! I love Big. Tom plays a little boy  Joshua ""Josh""Baskin,   who just wants to grow up fast. And he does; too fast.  He goes into this adventure type of job, everybody's dream job, he is to decide which toy is the most fun one! Tom Hanks received his first Oscar nomination for the part.My favorite scenes: the gigantic keyboard with Josh and his boss playing it with their feet. That is a memorable scene.  I also like the scene where he decides that he really liked his family and wants to enjoy his childhood. My favorite quotes: ""Josh"": "" I wish I were big."" I highly recommend this movie for people of all ages, specially for adults, because it will make you reminisce about your own life.",Big
96,nicolechan916,Amusing,7,14 January 2017,"This must have been the original version of 13 Going on 30, which was very enjoyable for me when I was younger. While I probably relate more to 13 and wouldn't watch Big over that, it was enjoyable as well.Hanks does a great job at acting as a kid trapped in an adult's body. His innocent expressions, and characteristics are typically boy like. However, it does seem to me that young Josh acted a bit more mature than the big Josh. It was more like young and old Josh could have been anyone, as the movie's concept was just to show a kid being put into an adult's body. Because if you look at 13, the young and old lives interact and affect the overall story, while Big doesn't. The only overlap in characters is Billy, who also does a great job. The connection between Rushton and Hanks is well bonded and shows on screen.The concept was unique for that time, and is relatively non-cliché for today's world, making it still enjoyable to watch in the 21st century. The humor mainly comes from the discrepancy of an adult figure behaving, a little exaggeratedly, as a kid would. For the most part, the story presents itself as believable. However, the romance line is a little overboard for me, and felt quite disturbing to think about. Also, the character of Susan, is very questionable, especially since she's the only main female character in the film. It doesn't seem as if her character does much and she is predominantly used for as the typical female role.As well, it was insinuated that she was a corporate climber which I was not expecting, and was surprised by. I understand that women like her do exist in the world, but to have the only female in the movie be of this character, is definitely questionable. Plus the fact that she has low self-esteem is a double whammy. Having been made in the 80's it is expected, and so I won't comment any further on that.Another thing I didn't really understand about the film, was the search for the arcade machine. How would there be a record of where the games are, and why would it take so long to get the results back? That was brushed over pretty quickly. Plus, in that time, the mother would surely have described her son's disappearance and linked it to grown up Josh who appeared to know where her son is. Overall, it is an enjoyable that's fun to watch, but has many questionable traits.",Big
97,jcolyer1229,Big,8,16 September 2007,"Fun movie about a boy in a man's body. A fortune telling machine grants Tom Hanks' wish to be big. Hanks is nerdy enough to pull it off. After becoming a father, I tended toward kid movies. The piano scene is unforgettable. Hanks and the owner of the toy company he works for play Chopsticks with their feet. Big is a kind of forerunner of Forrest Gump. Both films are about a simple mind in a mature body. Trouble in movies always seems to be centered around a female, and it is because Hanks wants to be with an older girl that he wishes to be big. It took me a long time to accept Tom Hanks. Big is the movie in which I first saw his talent.",Big
98,The_Core,"Warmhearted, funny and sweet",9,18 February 2001,"""Big"" never misses a step (nice piano playing!), thanks to Tom Hanks' incredible acting and a terrific screenplay that walks a very thin line between funny/endearing and sappy/silly, but never once steps off onto the wrong side.  A wonderful exploration into what it would be like to be a kid in an adult's body (and aren't we all, really, although some people seem to be more childish than child-like :-).Tom Hanks is one of those actors who can act with his eyes (if you know what I mean... he can express emotion with a glance), and he's at the top of his form here.  This film is an examination of our highly stratified society (in this case, along the lines of age), and can really get you thinking as well as feeling.  This combination is rare in a film, and for that reason I give it a rating of 9/10.Despite the PG rating, my younger brother pointed out that the ""F"" word is used once in the film.  I didn't notice, and I doubt very many will. Recommended for kids of any age.",Big

100,kyrat,"Kind of creepy ""romance"" spoiled it for me",5,28 June 2010,"I was enjoying it until he begins a sexual relationship with an adult woman. And what does she do when she finds out he's 13? Not feel like a pervert, but check to see if he's of consenting age (16) as if she wants to continue the relationship. I was pretty disturbed by that.If I'd seen it in the 80's as a teen I probably would've liked it. However, seeing it today as an adult, having seen other movies that encourage an embrace of innocence, that cover body- swapping/dealing with sudden adulthood (I'm thinking particularly) the original Freaky Friday - I'm just not that impressed. Worth a watch I guess for the early scenes.",Big
101,kyle-cruse,Pretty good,8,16 September 2008,"""Big"" is really the film that started the fish-out-of-water films, such as ""Freaky Friday"" or ""Enchanted,"" in which the characters are suddenly (magically) placed in odd positions in which they are in another body or another world and no one will believe what has happened to them, so they must fake their way through the problem. A 13-year-old is tired of being a kid and being too small to do anything, so he finds a wishing machine and wishes to be ""big."" He wakes up the next day in an adult body and cannot convince anyone, except his friend, who he really is. By implausible coincidence and chance, however, he ends up getting an easy job in a toy company and makes some new friends (and enemies) as well as a girlfriend along the way. The film proved to be enjoyable and even tender and moving, with great scenes such as Tom Hanks' interactions with the owner of the toy company (very funny). Nevertheless, it was not a perfect film for me. For one thing, I don't really understand why people consider this a family film just because it has kids in it. The profanity and female upper-nudity are really way too strong for a family film. I would have liked it more had it been more family-friendly. Also, some of the scenes can be a bit annoying, such as the silly ones with Tom Hanks playing around with his ice cream sundae. That said, it is still quite an enjoyable film. It is considered monumental being the first of its kind, though I actually enjoy ""Freaky Friday"" and films like that more than this one. Still lots of fun.*** out of ****",Big

How would a boy grow up to be a man, when he's already been a man?Everything is wonderful about 'Big'. The romantic element is so strong in the movie and Tom Hanks uses the boy element in a way that makes the audience almost participate in his first love making.Although not an artistic film, 'Big' has that 80s feel of a movie that speaks to our soul, about a vague nostalgic loss.A modern but classic fairytale.10/10",Big

104,yongkang-27205,A classic feel good film,9,30 December 2020,"The acting, the plot, man that was superb. To see Tom Hanks have to go through that dilemma, to have to be forced to decide between what could very well be his true love or to his actual life, back with his family, his friends. That really melted my heart. I'm happy to say that this was a film that I enjoyed thoroughly from the very beginning till the end.However, there are also 2 points that I think could be further elaborated on which would have made this film truly fantastic. Firstly, and this is just my opinion, I'd have much preferred if they had, at the end, perhaps a cut to like 10 years into the future where the 2 of them met again. Maybe even end of with a happily ever after type thing. This would have sealed the deal for me. Secondly, a greater emphasis could have been put on the longing on the side of the mother and how Tom had to grapple with knowing the suffering his friends and family had faced. It kind of felt more like everything was taken into account on a shallow perspective. Whilst that would have been fitting to the role given that he was a 13 year old in a 30 year old body, the unrealistic elaboration of this idea would have made it spectacular.All in all, despite its flaws, this film checked all the boxes for me and am definitely happy to have spent over 2 hours of my life on the film.

106,Deusvolt,A young boy becomes an adult because of a wish he made at a mysterious magical dime attraction at a carnival.,8,25 February 2005,"Yes this movie is wonderful - funny with poignant moments such as the breakup between Josh as an adult (Hanks) and Susan (Perkins).Loggia as a truly fun loving toy magnate is convincing. That dance on the piano sequence with Tom Hanks has become a classic.The best actor in the film is Jared Rushton who portrays Josh's (Tom Hanks)best friend. I liked that scene when the magically grown up and unrecognizable Josh tries to convince Billy that he really is Josh by going through their silly dance and rhyme routine with lots of funny hand motions.My problem with this movie is that I saw a movie with a very similar plot in the 1950s. It was in color and it was about a boy who magically became an adult and had a love affair with a woman. In the closing scene he rides off in a carriage (in New York's Central Park or is it the Bois d' Bologne in Paris?) as he transforms back into a boy. I can't remember the entire film as I saw it when I was six or seven years old. So as far as I am concerned, this movie is a remake and the writers did not acknowledge that they cadged the plot from another movie with another writer. I have been told by an IMDb user that the movie was Story of Three Loves which had three episodes. The second episode was about a boy who became a man overnight and had a romance with his nanny, portrayed by Leslie Caron. It was set in Paris.",Big
107,heyimmyx,Immy's review : Charming,10,22 August 2020,"A classic 80s movie about a boy who wishes he was big and wakes up the next day as a 30 year old. I adore this movie as it gives us a glimpse into the contrasting worlds of a child and adult. Tom Hanks was perfect as 13 year old Josh Basket, portraying all of the mannerisms and emotions of a typical 13 year old boy. The film was unapologetic in exploring the dull, cruel and selfish world of adults, and how the joy and ebullience of childhood is something we should cherish, deeply conveying the harrowing contrasts between the two. It was heartwarming watching Josh experience all of these new and different things like his first love, first job etc, and having to adapt to a more judgemental and corporate world around him. I love how pro-kid the movie was, conveying the life and joy that Josh brought to those around him, conveying a different side to adulthood and that we could learn a thing or two from our childhood. The characters were all refreshing and well developed, especially Elizabeth Perkin's character, who is moved by Josh's youthful attitude and adopts a more carefree vibe to life because of him, subsequently ditching her narcissistic boyfriend. What really makes his movie stand out is how realistic it felt ; The reaction of his mum, the judgement he faced, his innocent and rather clueless reactions to situations he has never come across before, even the way he set up his apartment! It truly showed us how a kid would react in these situations, and how their minds work differently to ours. The film had amazing screenplay and direction, creating a warm, sharp and infectious little movie. Some scenes were truly mesmerising, including the piano scene (classic!). Lastly, the ending was perfect, ending the movie on a sad but bittersweet note. Highly recommend!",Big

Considering all his previous ventures, SPLASH was the only early Hanks vehicle with any interest, and now comes BIG, which is not only a fun movie to watch, but it's also the best of the Kid-Inside-An-Adult-Body movies, and probably the only good one out there.  BIG is a well-made movie that will always be with us for a really long time.  Bravo for Hanks.4 out of 5",Big
110,drawlife,Irresistible charm from Tom Hanks.,8,26 July 2020,"BIG is one of the best feel good films ever, even if some of the tropes have not aged well.Pretty simple body swap formula going on here more or less, and at the time I believe there were four different body swap films releasing within the same year as BIG. Out of them, BIG was the clear champion and a lot of that has to do with Tom Hanks' amazing performance, perfectly capturing the essence of a 13 year old boy. Being a fan of the film it is said that Hanks studied David Moscow's performance as his younger self as Moscow would act out the scenes in front of Tom during the shoot. Also credit to Penny Marshall's directing as she would be able to help Tom tone down or elevate his performance on screen. They both make the comedy feel very natural and unforced.Child actors are a pet peeve of mine, but here David Moscow and Jared Rushton (who plays his best friend) do a good job showcasing their range, in no small part from Marshall. Supporting cast is great as Robert Loggia and John Heard have some good bits in the film.Now yes, there is some questionable romance at play in the film and may raise eyebrows nowadays, but strangely as creepy as it sounds, somehow Tom Hanks and Elizabeth Perkins just make it work and make it oddly engaging. Hanks' Josh Baskin shows Perkins' Susan how to have fun and more laid back and it has a charm to it. Its very hard to describe in words, but it just works even if the thought of a 30 something year old woman falling in love with a 13 year old in his 30 year old body to be mildly creepy.There are some issues I do take with the film. Mainly how there are some unanswered questions like how no cops were ever involved when Josh goes ""missing,"" or why his phone call to his mother is not traced, or how he was able to get a job with no background check, making up social security numbers on the fly, implied workplace harassment at his job, or the sudden disappearance of the older Josh, how will that get explained to his landlord or his coworkers? The film doesn't shy away from it's fantasy themed presence, and it's one thing to buy into a magical machine that grants wishes, but it's another thing when the facets of reality is totally dismissed. I'm not saying everything needs to be answered for as it is a movie, but closing up some loose threads would certainly be a nice knot to the film. Admittedly that would be a challenge, but it would give the film in my opinion some level groundedness.Despite all that, the charm of Tom Hanks and his chemistry with Elizabeth Banks does enough to make it feel earnest and engaging. Underneath the comedy, Josh navigates being an adult at a young age and the responsibilities of being an adult gets to Josh and wishes to be a kid again. It is relatable in a sense that we all at some point yearn for our youth, that is why BIG hits all the right notes compared to most body swap films. Kudos to Penny Marshall for breaking through as this film is the first female directed film to break $100 million at the box office. Personally prefer the extended edition as I felt it gave a little more flare to the movie. Either way you can't go wrong.8.5/10",Big
111,Andreas_N,Growing up as a lesson of life,8,9 November 2005,"This movie is great. I mean, really. That's what every boy dreams of - becoming an adult overnight! It's absolutely gorgeous to see Tom Hanks' performance - that's real acting, it requires a lot to play this part as genuinely and cordial as he did. The message is so clear and so honest. The nostalgic edge is of such profound significance to the story. It's about the differences between being a kid and being an adult. It's about two very different perceptions of the same world that surrounds us. It's just us and how we make the best out of every day of our lives, and all it needs is to see the world through the eyes of a kid. A kid perceives all the things differently, with much more native and modest simplicity - the keystone to imagination and magic, the keystone to cherish the daily miracles in our lives. This movie has a deep and very pervasive message. It has so much charm and vitality mingled with nostalgia and witchcraft. One of those movies I enjoyed watching when I was a kid. Recommended.",Big

114,nelliebell-1,Make a wish!,7,9 October 2004,"It is perhaps a genuine consolation that in fact nothing like this occurred.It is also one of the more entertaining values that the motion picture can provide and that is an imaginative and entertaining vehicle for growing up,call it magic if you will or maybe love but whatever you want to call it,it works pretty well in this motion picture.I am of the general opinion that some one up there has got to like you in order to find the right personality for the part.Actor Tom Hanks has from time to time found the right part and because of the nature of opportunity if you will he is one of the biggest draws on the silver screen and I might add justifiably so.It is not so much big that is convincing,but a personality that is not winning but genuine.It seems that one of the most difficult chores that a performer has is to convince the audience that what there being sold on is not only real but genuine and by the looks of things Tom Hanks possesses that ability wherein he is neither unscrupulous or bastardly and we have as of yet to grow up.That is to Tom Hanks credit.There are other performances that are of worth noting in this film,Robert Loggia was a favorite from the nights of T.H.E.Cat and does a very good job of providing for young josh and his toy company an absolutely great vehicle for having fun.Elizabeth Perkins is a looker from way back, while there are many things about growing up that we seem to have in common, getting to know girls would seem to be one of those things.It is in fact what causes the wish of wanting to be Big and that is so Josh could go on the ride with the young girl,if you recall. The young friend is a good young kid and indeed when the picture is being a picture he tries almost half heartedly to keep there friendship as it was however you do feel the strain and the changeover that occurs with the advent of the Zoltar.One of the difficulties in looking at this type of development that is the story line is that you run into the grown up idea of right and wrong and then there is the imaginative world of the motion picture.What is the result?A film that possesses a naive ability to love and enjoy life.I think this film were it ever to be a demand you would know that it was not from being unfriendly but from being genuine.There is belief in what is conveyed to the viewer by the performers and that is helped tremendously by the story line which is hard to believe to begin with.I gave this a eight for no apparent reason other than puppy love and the desire for completion in a human beings life.I guess we all have to grow up sooner or later.An enjoyable time at the movies was had viewing this motion picture.It makes a good purchase and worthwhile to keep so that when you run out of murders,monsters and wars you put this one on and have a very good time.",Big

The movie is honest, funny and surprisingly sweet. It has deep messages about growing-up and friendship. Big appreciation to smart script that never left this movie from being dull or silly with it's risky theme. All the jokes and romance work as it should be, also a more than fine performance from Tom Hanks has lifted these through higher achievement. His performance makes us believe at Josh Baskin's character, a 13 years old child who suddenly appeared in a 30 years old body. Also solid performance from all supporting casts set ""Big"" into a fascinating film to see. Overall ""Big"" is a well acted and directed drama that always be missed. It's a romantic-comedy that teaches a lot moral attitude inside and definitely doesn't offer only on sexuality or bad words like most of Rom-Com nowadays.",Big
116,KIDOLOHKEN,wonderful,10,24 January 2020,"Modern drama fantasy. If this happens ... the story that started with a simple idea of what you say turned out to be a masterpiece unexpectedly ... I think it's a script that God made the writer draw well. The heroine is good after all. I think that it is wonderful that the role is not too beautiful and not too able. The gradation of from the heroine appears, how her entangles with the hero, and how the emotions with the heroine and hero get deepen is fascinating. Eventually, the heroine almost becomes the protagonist, and emotions collide with the hero. And ... The transition from comedy for children to love romance for adults is such an amazing story that any human being can't think of it.

The story is pretty fake but it is definitely a family movie. I thought this was the start of Tom Hanks' brilliant career in acting. He was nominated for this funny, caring part. It had a lot of funny parts and a lot of tense parts in this comedy. It was really funny. It's the ultimate family film that will keep you laughing all the way through. This movie is not a regular comedy. It has a lot of fantasy. But it is so funny that you forget how not real this movie really is. It was a good movie and I recommend it to all viewers.",Big

As a kid he was bullied and harassed by other classmates so one night he attends a local carnival where he finds a machine fortune teller. The next day he gets Big and runs away to New York and ends up taking a job at FAO Swartz headed by the late Robert Loggia and he shared the infamous piano scene with Hanks. I remember watching this as a kid and enjoyed it and now I had the privilege of sharing the experience with my son and to teach him that he should enjoy his childhood before he ends up having grown up responsibilities and having to make difficult decisions in life. This Gary Marshall film directed by his sister Penny was delightful and fun to watch again. Elizabeth Perkins played Hanks grown up girlfriend and the late John Heard was the executive in charge of new toy development.

119,AsifZamir,"Kids want to be adults, adults want to be kids.",10,13 November 2013,"Tom Hanks stars in the movie Big, cast in 1998. Ever wish you went to Never Never Land and never grew up? Well, in Big it is just the opposite. 12 year old Josh Baskin (David Moscow) wishes to become big when he is not tall enough to go on a carnival ride. (I'm a short person so I understand his pain, haha) He then places a coin in Zoltar Speaks (a fortune teller arcade game) and makes a wish. The machine then shoots out a card saying his wish has been granted and continues to work even after the machine has been unplugged from the electrical socket.What happens next is the opposite of Never Never Land, Baskin becomes grown up in a man's body (Hanks) and embarks on a whole new world where he becomes involved in a love affair, finds a job working for Macmillan Toy Company under Mr. Macmillan (Robert Loggia) and gets promoted to a dream job. He has his trusty school friend Billy (Jared Rushton) to help him along the way.Big is a showcase for Tom Hanks and was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role for the Academy Awards. David Moscow who played the young Josh Baskin. and Jared Rushton who played Billy, received the review that the film ""Features believable young teen-age mannerisms from the two real boys in its cast and this only makes Mr. Hanks's funny, flawless impression that much more adorable,"" from the New York Times.

I'm a HUGE Tom Hanks fan and I trie to see and collect all of his movies and it's cool to have a film that gave him his first Oscar-nomination, fame and made him a fun and better actor. He played awesome! Really fun, cute and just plays his role as a 12 something year old boy, stuck in a thirty year old mans body really good. There aren't many who could play that role as he did.Elizabeth Perkins is always enjoyable to watch and in this particular film, she's fun, sweet and kind. She and Hanks really needs to play some more films together...This is a really enjoyable movie and I love it, and I really want everybody (who hasn't seen it) to watch it and love it as much as I did.P.S.

121,randreww,Big Heart,8,11 December 2017,"Every now & then, there comes a film that breaks the mould. And this film does this on so many levels. It's very clever writing, but even better performances by the main cast of about 3 people. It's a film that emphasises the sadness found in happy moments. The 13 year old boy finds enjoyment becoming adult, & the girl can't help but enjoy acting childish. Both swap places by the final act of the film, & that's what makes it so dynamic. I love the candour on display here. They straight out depict the working life as a stressful one which leaves no time for enjoyment. This makes the girl feel like she has very little time left for finding true love. And that in itself is also stressing her out, until she realises that love isn't the only root to enjoyment. And as they both learn to adapt to each other, they fall in love. It's very sweet, & it is handled very sincerely. It is directed in that inimitable seamless way of the late 80's, where long takes, static lock off shots, & eye-level angles make you forget the camera is even in the room. And the music is used sparingly, but effectively. It's a film I keep coming back to every 5 years. It reminds me not to take age for granted, & it also reminds me how lucky I was to be in love once. It's also very funny! Go see it.",Big

Tom Hanks did a great job in this movie. You can tell that he enjoyed the role and the chance to act a bit younger that his age :). It's the kind of movie that is fun to watch and you can relate to it no matter the age. The acting of all the cast was great. And the piano playing scene made me want to go find a giant piano and play heart and soul on it. That actually was one of the best scenes in the movie. And in movies in general one of the most remember-able. I think that it would be fun to have a job where you could act like a little kid and play with the new toys that are supposed to be coming out soon. And have an opinion on what your children play with. It shows a side to adults that younger children don't get to see all that often. And its enjoyable to see that side out anyone. A movie that is very well done and I recommend it to anyone who has yet to see it. It is one that you will enjoy.,Big

But he went to New York City with his best friend to find it and turn back into a child. And that is what he did at the end. ""Big"" is a movie for all ages to watch and enjoy.

127,MikeK1987,This is definitely a movie that nobody would be able to make today...,9,6 February 2010,"There's really not much else I can say about this film. I get the message of not to take life to seriously as an adult, etc. Everything to that angle has been said, I can't really say much else. Of course Tom Hanks' performance is flawless, as is almost everything else he does (the key word is 'almost'). Most of the other characters are well-acted, etc. Once again, there's not much else I can say about this movie from that angle either that hasn't already been said.I think what compels me the most about this film, is that, due to the spread of political correctness, this film, as it is, would not be able to be made today. It's a time capsule of the late 80's, right in the middle of the Reagan-Bush, Sr. years, the high point of ""Just Say No"", during the conservative backlash against the forward progress made in the 60's and 70's. Don't get me wrong, I'm as liberal as the next guy, but I still can't stand political correctness. It's a step in the wrong direction, in my opinion. But it goes to show you that the late 80's-early 90's, compared to now, you could get away with a lot in films.First of all, all of Josh's exploits, as an adult, are going on while his poor mother thinks that he's been kidnapped and is tied up or being raped in a basement somewhere, or something to that extent, and that alone would stop this movie from getting green-lit. Also, the scene where Josh sleeps with Susan, would not be able to be included in the film, because most censorship groups would protest this film saying things like 'They're showing a scene with a 30-year-old woman having pre-marital relations with a 13-year-old boy?' The educated would know that type of thing has already been shown in European cinema and American classrooms.Even though there is a lot of trash on television these days, there is now, thanks to some politicians (Democrat or Republican, doesn't matter) who have really messed things up with the PC movement, a real fear about what people can and can't say, and this film is a testament to those times when people didn't care as much, and wouldn't unless it were pointed out to them by rambling pundits with nothing better to do. Oh wait? Aren't I doing just that? Now there's something to think about...Oh, and one final note... In the scene where Josh is trying to impress a girl by trying to get on to the ferris wheel, he gets chewed out by some jerk ride operator for being too short, and told to 'get on the kiddie ride'. Josh's parents must've been a couple of real wusses. If I went to a carnival, and some a--hole carney was picking on my kid for whatever reason, I'd f--king punch his lights out. If Josh's parents had defended him, or at least shown him how to defend himself or have confidence in himself in such situations, and given that carney what he deserved, maybe the whole debacle of him wishing to be big and inadvertently turning into an adult wouldn't have happened. But then again, we wouldn't have had this movie. But in the real world, I wouldn't let that happen, and I bet that most parents would do the same for their children.",Big
128,Seersha1,Charming film,7,8 June 2010,"It's hard to imagine that a movie like this once had the ability to land an actor an Oscar nomination. These days I think it would be almost impossible for that to happen. That doesn't take away from the fact that, yes, Tom Hanks makes the role all he can. I have come the conclusion though that Tom Hanks is just that kind of actor that can pull anything off and do it, if not outstandingly, at the very least really, really well. He shows enthusiasm and nervousness in equal measures and makes it believable that he's only a thirteen year old boy trapped in an older body, trying his best to be an adult when the reality is he is far from it. I also want to say the other actors are all fantastic, and it's a fun movie that can be enjoyed by the entire family.",Big

I smiled, i laughed, i sometimes howled of laughter when watching the situations that emerges when a kid tries to be an adult. My favourite scene is the one where Susan gets to see Josh's apartment. You can't help loving Josh Baskin when you've watched through, and it is mostly because of Tom Hanks. I've seen the man in dramatic roles like The Green Mile, Cast Away, The Terminal and Catch Me If You Can, but though they're all brilliant, Hanks has his finest hour when he he is childlike characters like Forrest Gump and Big. Amazing. 9/10P.S. (Here is the small spoiler) Josh acts more like he's 8/9 than 12/13. I think I can say for sure that most 13-year old boys would've grasped what Susan wanted (I know I would've when I was 13). They probably wouldn't known what to DO about her wish, being inexperienced and all, but anyway my point is: 13-year old boys have heard, and want, sex!",Big
130,Petunia-2,Stand Out Performances Make This Movie A Must See,10,18 September 1999,"Forget ""Philadelphia"" and ""Forrest Gump"", I think Hanks shines in his comedic performances.  ""Splash"" was my favorite of Hanks' films until I saw ""Big"" where a little boy gets more than he wishes for!A young boy, after being embarrassed at a carnival where he is rejected as being ""not tall enough"" for a ride in front of the class beauty, makes a wish on an electronic machine to be ""Big.""  After the card reveals ""your wish is granted"", he notices the machine is not plugged in!The next morning he awakes as Tom Hanks to a screaming mother telling him to get ready for school.  Havoc ensues.  There are many great scenes in the movie, particularly when Hanks, reacting to Elizabeth Perkins, a coworker who is coming on to him, innocently responds, ""Oh, you mean you want to sleep over?  Okay, well I get to be on top"" (referring to his bunk beds).His best friend, Billy, is a born scene stealer.  (I remember him as the big mouth kid in Goldie Hawn's ""Overboard"").  His wide-eyed, slow reaction as he is coming to the realization that Hanks, who is singing a jingle that only the two of them knew, is priceless.A must see!",Big
131,lord-of-the-lez,Emotional and Nostalgic,7,3 June 2019,"I watched this when I was the same age as the main character of this movie and I found it just...okay. I remembered the Zoltar machine, the big piano, and all the toys Josh plays with but not much more.Rewatching it as an adult makes me appreciate it on a whole new level. I did not care for the emotional nuances of the movie and the dilemma that Josh was in because I myself was a kid the first time I watched it. I couldn't understand the depth of the movie's themes in the same way that Josh fails to have a truly deep, mature, emotional connection with another adult. Watching this movie as an adult also gives me this blissful sense of nostalgia for the little blip of time I spent as a child. Childhood is such a small part of your life compared to the time you spend as an adult, yet it makes a tremendous impact on you and what happens to you in those brief years leaves a lasting impression. Those are the thoughts and feelings this movie elicited in me and that's why it's highly recommended from me.",Big
132,Rebochan,Absolutely Fabulous,10,18 March 2001,"This is proof that Tom Hanks was an extremely gifted actor from the beginning, and has only gotten better since.  In this movie, 13-year-old Josh, upset about being little, sees a wish machine at a carnival and wishes to be big.  And big he gets-now he's Tom Hanks!  Unfortunatly, Josh learns that being grown-up is not all it's cracked up to be, and ultimately he must realize who he really is and where he really belongs.  Tom Hanks pulls off this role with amazing ability.  From the way he plays with a laser with another child, to the child-like face, you really believe that Hanks is, in fact, a child trapped in the body of an adult.  The plot is carefully constructed and never gets overly-dramatic.  Of course, it's extremely funny as well.  One of the best scenes in cinema is when Josh is playing Chopsticks on a piano key pad.  This film is a must-see for anyone who enjoys films, and especially if you enjoy Tom Hanks.",Big

I also started watching this movie its seems very good for a tom hanks movie at first I thought it was going to be stupid but I ended up loving it. It was funny enjoyable I can related to the main character being either too young or too old or dumb or smart but I think the learning message from this movie is to enjoy your life while you can weather your a kid a teenage or an adult just keep enjoying your life and have a great time.

134,swowen-84128,Love this movie,10,3 June 2020,"So today this movie is 32 years old! Yes June 3rd, 1988 Penny Marshall had this movie playing in US cinemas. I have watched this film 100's and i mean 100's of times, It is my all time favourite film, and with it being its birthday i thought i had really better review it for you guys. I will keep it spoiler free, just in case there are people out there who have not had the pleasure of seeing it.
So the movie! Joshua Baskin (played by David Moscow) is a 12 year old boy who lives in New Jersey with his parents and infant sister Rachel. Your normal 12 year old who hangs out with his best friend, Billy Francis Kopecki (played by Jared Rushton). Josh has developed a crush for a girl at his school, Cynthia Benson (played by Kimberlee M. Davis), Freddie Benson's Sister! Josh is over the moon when one day, while being stood outside a shop, shuffling through his baseball cards, with the usual ""need it, got it, got it need it"". Which i'm sure you have all done in your youth. Anyway back to this moment! Cynthia actually says ""hi Josh"". Well Billy is first to react and to tell Josh she must like him. With the Carnival in town Josh's parent's take him along to have some family fun. While there Josh notices Cynthia queuing for the Super Loops ride. She looks on her own, so Josh convinces his parents that he wants to go on it, and on his own. He pushes his way through the queue to where Cynthia is stood, as they begin to chat, Derek arrives, She introduces him to Josh and says to Josh, ""this is Derek, he drives"". As Josh gets to the front of the queue, his hopes of credibility are dashed as the operator of the ride tell him, he is too small to ride. With a sunken heart, the devastated boy walks away, as he is stood still, he notices a machine just slightly on its own, away from the usual video game section. Something attracts Josh to go to the machine. Its a Zoltar! Josh reads the instructions, inserts his 25 cents into the machine. Nothing happens! Josh gives it a little whack, then another, then another. Suddenly, the machine kicks into life! Josh follows the instructions and makes his wish. He utter the words ""I wish i was Big"", before hitting the red button, that releases his coin, down the ramp and a direct hit, into the mouth of Zoltar. A card drops out of the bottom of the machine, one side has the Zoltar emblem, with the words ""Zoltar Speaks"" and the opposite side says ""your wish is granted"". At this point a bewildered Josh notices that the machine is not connected to and electrical supply! He goes home, during a windy night in New Jersey, something magical happens! In the morning, Joshua slips from his top bunk and stumbles off to the bathroom. It is here that he has a shock! As he looks into the mirror, its not him looking back! its an older version (played by Tom Hanks). This scares Josh and does not know what to do! This starts a series of events, he tries to get Billy to help. When Josh approaches Billy, he does not think its Josh. Josh convinces him with their song, The Ice Cream Song
The space goes...
down down baby, down down the roller coaster.
Sweet sweet baby, sweet sweet don't let me go.
shimmy shimmy coco pop, shimmy shimmy rock,
etc
With the help of Billy he is able to run off to the city, to try to solve his problem. Its here, lonely and afraid that Josh's life changes.
As you can gather this movie is very very close to my heart and love every minute of it, even knowing the Ice Cream Song off by heart. Tom Hanks is an amazing actor and this movie really did help gather momentum behind his career and push him on to the major roles we know he got afterwards. I must say i also love the character of Susan (played by Elizabeth Perkins).
I hope i have inspired you to re-watch or even watch for the first time this movie. Its a long post, i know i haven't spoilt it with spoilers, so go and indulge in this multi award winning fantasy comedy movie. Try to see if you can see the extended version, its 2 hours 10 minutes, compared to 1 hour 44 minutes of the standard version, so nearly an extra half an hour of pleasure.",Big

Bed time was always 9pm so I can honestly say that if I had 1 wish when I was a kid, it would have been to be 'big' too! But Tom Hanks takes this role to a whole new level. You'll be mesmerized by the music (see piano with his feet scene) and the humorous scenes, including what happens when a kid competes in the toy making challenge with a smart ass!

In real life, there's a good reason we don't go around playing with toys and dropping water balloons on people. But that doesn't really matter. ""Big"" is still an enjoyable, indeed magical, movie experience.""Big"" is about a 13-year-old boy, Josh, who still plays with toys, is not mature enough for girls to take him seriously, and not even tall enough to get on a carnival ride. He comes across a mysterious Zoltar machine and wishes to be big. The next day he wakes up to find himself in Tom Hanks's 30-year-old body. Josh makes the best of the situation by pretending to be kidnapped and then joining adult society.The only complaint I have about this film is the level of willful suspension of disbelief the audience is expected to suspend. I will buy that a Zoltar machine will grant a kid's wish to become an adult overnight. But when the 13-year-old adult goes to apply for a job, he only has to fill out a one-page application, using a made-up social security number, has no resume, no references, and is hired after stumbling through a 30-second interview. Then, after a couple chance encounters with the company's owner, he is promoted to vice-president. The kid accomplishes more in a week thanks to his adult body than I have my whole life. Maybe it was just easier to get a job in the '80s.On top of that, Josh dates one of his coworkers and manages to get to second base (on camera, probably to home plate off camera). He will be the only boy in the seventh grade who won't be lying when he says he's gone all the way. Eventually Josh learns that being an adult isn't all fun and games, and yearns to be a kid again.The movie is better if you don't think too hard. It's still a fun movie, and a minor classic in its own way. Tom Hanks is great in his role. He never seems to forget that he is a kid, and all his mannerisms have the nuances of a young boy. The scene where Josh plays a giant keyboard with his boss is one of those iconic moments in cinema that will stick with you your whole life.""Big"" works as a fantasy. It has the charm of an old Frank Capra film. As long as you go with the flow and don't question the movie's logic, you will find it thoroughly enjoyable.",Big

An excellent family film!",Big
141,bradleyadita,i was 9 when this came out,8,18 November 2004,"Penny Marshall's top grossing film, Big, was a crossover cinematic experience. Hank's film career was solidified with this here film, well deserved as he delivers an amazing portrayal of a 13-year-old in a 30-year-old's body. Neverunderestimate the power of the extraordinary, especially if you have aHollywood tech crew in the wings,. moreover be careful what you wish for, you just might get your wish. I've always associated Big with another 80's movie. ""Mr. Mom,"" both sharingboardroom scenes involving a new employee who speaks from personalexperience as opposed to well funded corporate research. And they bothproduced their own instantly recognizable and forever classic moments, Big,(frolicking on the toy store piano), Mr. Mom, (crossing the finish line in slow motion with the highly dramatic music). While Mr. Mom addresses feministtopics in an pedestrian Hollywood manner, Big begs similar questions aboutyouth. Similar to Groundhog Day (though not nearly as funny or potent), in Big we are asked to swallow bizarre ""impossible"" plots with a spoonful of sugarprovided by amazing lead performances. Hank's boyish looks and his sugarhigh antics or homesick appear so authentic. Though the plot could havecontinued along the line of Hanks remaining an adult, it is with bravery that the writers return Hanks to his original family and life. The films ending was rather touching even if it is somehow inexplicable. (What exactly triggers him to be normal again, first time he was sleeping at the end it occurs while walking back up to his parents house...) Despite the incongruence we buy it becausenarratively it works and it also implies that his adult love interest actually experiences the transformation, in a way sharing and proving that theimpossible was real and true. While Big has probably become some what dusty over it's 14 year history, it will remain one of the classic 80's family films. Though we have yet to see for sure, it is my guess that well written / acted films will eclipse their CGI / special effects in the long run.

The characters in this movie are brilliant. I do not feel bore or over-acted throughout the film.In this film, I found many good things to learn. Like, Josh and Billy had a wonderful friendship. A friend in need is a friend indeed.Then the character of Susan (Elizabeth Perkins), her arrogance, smartness and seductive corporate nature turned calm when she gets closer to 30-years old Josh, who is innocent like a 12 years boy (because he is a twelve-year-old boy).Mr. MacMillan (Robert Loggia), the nature of a true businessman and visionary, who knew to whom to invest for market growth of his toy manufacture business and take it to the next level.Here I pointed out five reasons why you must like the movie ""BIG"".1. Be careful before, what you wish from unplugged Zoltar? Josh (David Moscow), a little boy of thirteen who wished to an unusual antique arcade fortune teller machine called Zoltar Speaks to become ""big"". The machine was dramatically supernatural and was unplugged at that moment. When Josh woke up next morning, he found himself turned into a grown-up 30 years old man (Tom Hanks). Next time when you get a fortune teller machine like Zoltar, be careful what you wish!2. ""A thirteen-year-old boy always wants a thirteen-year-old girl"":Mr. MacMillan (Robert Loggia), owner of one of the big toy company in New York, spends his valuable time to kid's toy store in the city to read their mind. According to his personal opinion of reading the children's mind, he came to a conclusion that every thirteen years old boy wants a thirteen years old girl for playing. To some extent, I felt his opinion is indeed correct.3. Woman loves innocent man, but she also wants some point of maturity to choose him as husband:Susan (Elizabeth Perkins) played a magnificent role in this film. She shows how cruel and ruthless it can be working inside a corporate in the city of New York. Here people can do anything to secure a job or earn a position.Her true seductive nature to ride on the corporate ladder was touched by humanity when she came closer to know Josh, (who got a low-level job at MacMillen Toy Company. A chance encounter with the owner Mr.MacMillen of the company leads him to a promotion testing new toys).4. In love, there are sacrifices: Throughout the film, Elizabeth Perkins acted very well in Susan's character. Especially at the end when she was decided to marry Josh but came to know the truth that Josh is just a boy of thirteen, she accepted the whole matter very honestly. She respected the choice of Josh (Tom Hanks) to turn again into thirteen- year-old and enjoy his life as a child.5. If the same story had been given to a Bollywood director what will happen?– Instead of Zoltar, in Bollywood it will be Bajrang Bali.– The card ""Your Wish Is Granted"" will be a sacred flower. – When Josh asked Susan to come back to thirteen again, in Bollywood version Susan will say ""yes"", and she will jump on it. (If the director follows the original story then perhaps he will read this review and prove I am wrong). :)– It will be obvious that Bollywood version will include at least six – seven songs which will increase an extra hour for the Indian audience.Hope you enjoy this review. Do not miss the film, Big (1988) if you still not watched.",Big
143,gambilljen,Every boys wish and nightmare,9,28 December 2005,"This is a great movie about a boy who makes a wish at the fair to become big. When he wakes up, he finds himself fully grown. It's been a while since I've seen this, but it is very funny and very touching too. This is more of a boys tale than anything else. The acting is great and anyone looking for an overall enjoyable movie will like this. There is some inappropriate material in the movie, so it is not for everyone. The film is a true classic and should continue to be a classic. It is also one of Tom Hank's best performance's. But get some popcorn and enjoy the movie!

144,mao-yana32,Review,10,10 August 2013,"A boy makes a wish to be big on a magical machine as he cannot ride a roller coaster in a carnival because of his height and he puts shame in front of a beautiful girl. The next morning, he finds himself to become an adult. This film is a comedy and describes the boy's life in society. I feel that the flexible and childlike ideas are helpful as new points of view and I think I want to hold a childlike mind in the future. There are my favorite scenes in this film. The one is that the boy does not change his life-style and thoughts after becoming an adult and the other is that what he says is considered jokes or metaphors by adults. This film is heart-warming and it may remind audiences of their original intension before getting a job, so I want to everyone to watch this film.",Big
145,aidar24,The movie that may have began Tom Hanks career,9,15 December 2009,"The movie explains the importance of growing up threw childhood.The movie Big (1988) does a great job, viewing the essence of childhood and adult life. It starts out with Josh(Tom Hanks), a typical 12-year-old boy, at a carnival. He sees Cynthia Benson, the girl that he likes. He wants to take a ride with her, but the Ticket Taker won't allow him go through because he isn't tall enough. Then he sees a machine that looks mysterious. The machine asks him to make a wish, so he chooses to be Big.The next morning he gets transformed into a adult. His mother doesn't believe that he's Josh. She thinks the man in her house is a burglar. She threatens Josh to get out of the house. Josh goes to find his best friend to get help. His best friend, Billy, helps him get a hotel room to stay for one night. He needs to get a job and try to live as an adult. Living as an adult, he gets promoted to Vice President of a toy company. He is enjoying his job and has an encounter with a woman.He has to choose to go back or stay Big.--A.Haynes--",Big
146,Jeremy_brewer1,Always has been one of my favorite movies,10,24 February 2012,"This movie was made with a lot of imagination. There is no way a machine can grant a wish that will come true. It was cool that it did though because if he did the entire movie as a kid. It wouldn't be as good and it would have a different plot. The part that always surprised me is when he made up a social security number and he still gets the job. There is no way that will ever work. Also it was a small check he got from work, but I understood he was really happy since it was his first check. I still don't understand why they didn't make this movie a sequel. Because it would be very different if his friend made a wish in the second movie. I don't know who his tailor was, but I would never wear the rental tuxedo he wore to the party. What are the odds of a woman wanting to stay over at a apartment like he had. Maybe it would be like 1 out of 10 people perhaps.",Big

Until getting the magic box and back to child, Josh goes to New York and starts to work at a toy company. He succeeds in the work, because he is a child and knows what children like. He falls in love with a female coworker, but he is just a child. Very very young Tom Hunks, anyway he is a great actor since young. We grow up and forgot being childish in good meanings. We, adults, forgot being pure and enjoy every moment. We used to dream of becoming big, but are we what we dreamed in childhood?",Big
148,sosomo-so,Tommy Hanks,9,5 October 2020,Tom Hanks should do more comedy. This one really pulled on the heart strings for sure.,Big
149,simontaylor-44498,Big,8,3 April 2016,"Tom Hanks stars in Big, one-half of a Freaky Friday experience. Josh is a 12-year-old schoolboy who laments his short stature deeming him too small to take part in a carnival ride. One ill conceived wish for a fortune teller arcade machine and he waked up 30.While Big predated the better-known 1995 and 2003 editions of Freaky Friday, it comes after the original novel and first adaptation in the 1970's. The concept isn't outstandingly new, but at the time of its release in 1988 there had been relatively few successful predecessors in the genre. Therefore, while the entire plot can be worked out from almost the first couple of scenes, it would be remiss to forget that Big as much as any other film created the mould that so many followed.Hanks is outstanding, capturing the essence of tweenagerdom in a highly believable performance. There is no doubt Josh really is a 12-year-old trapped in a body more than twice his age, and the versatility Hanks is known for is apparent here; he can jump around like Jedward on the blue Smarties as easily as he can sob into his pillow like the terrified child he really is.Big places Josh as a product tester for a toy manufacturer which gives some credibility to his continued existence in the adult world. He sticks out like a sore thumb, of course, but has the expected insight into what children really want from their toys. That he is embraced as an eccentric rather than a child under a magic spell is hardly a stretch. It is his entry into the business that leads to one of the best scenes of the movie as Josh and MacMillan (Loggia) himself dance on a large floor piano.There are plenty of plot holes that drag the film down, though. After a prolonged period of being a big kid, Josh's transition to pseudo-adult is rapid and for the most part unexplained, suggesting that the writers just wanted to get to the next bit of the storyboard. He uses his real name despite the police apparently (though invisibly) looking for him, and nobody ever seems to wonder where his best friend Billy (Rushton) keeps disappearing to.Predictable now but groundbreaking at the time, Big has a warm feel to it and an inoffensive plot. It's nostalgic and pulls of one of the few non-cheesy teenage bromances in Hollywood's history. A little suspension of disbelief is required, but for an easy Sunday afternoon it's worth a watch.",Big
150,aliuelic,Give two big thumbs up to Tom Hanks,8,9 March 2017,"Every child wants to become a grownup at some time. And a young boy named Josh had his wish come true by accident in the movie. This lucky big boy is portrayed by Tom Hanks. Wow, he is fabulous! I was so impressed by the scenes when big Josh had to spend the first night alone in a flophouse. He really made an 30-year-old adult with a 13-year-old mind come alive. There's a girl's version of Big called 13 Going on 30, but in my opinion it's not that good or charming by comparison.",Big

I love Tom Hanks character and i love most of all Elizabeth Perkins role in the picture. The movie shows what it means to be a kid at heart and to have a little fun in life. It is an original film with an original script and it grants every kids biggest wish..to grow up and it grants every grown ups wish..to be young again. if you see any movie today, see this movie, you wont be disappointed, the greatest kids movie and a great grown up movie. 10 out of 10",Big

153,Jazzcat,"Heartwarming, hilarious, wonderful.",10,20 November 1999,"Big is one of those movies that captures the world of a child perfectly. Tom Hanks is Josh, a 13 year old kid who wants the respect and freedom that comes with being ""big"".  Then after making a wish at a carnival, he wakes up the next morning and discovers that he has physically aged 15 years or more! But he is still the same kid inside.  While searching for the carnival game that will make him ""small"" again, Josh moves into the Big City of NY and climbs the ladder of corporate success at, where else, a toy company.  Along the way, he befuddles, perplexes, and exasperates a great many anal corporate executives, and helps one jaded woman executive recover her lost childhood innocence.The movie is loaded with hilarious scenes and dialogue.  For example, here is one scene (spoiler alert!) where big Josh is on the phone with his mother after disappearing from home.  Josh is pretending to be a man who has abducted Josh, since this is what his mother believes happened to him.  His mother tells him, ""If you harm one hair on his head, I will dedicate the rest of my life to making you suffer!""  Josh sits there stunned for a moment, then says ""Wow....thanks!""Overall, this movie does a wonderful job of gently reminding us who are ""big"" that we should not take life so seriously.",Big
154,craigsiney,What a fun movie,8,23 September 2000,"Big is a really fun movie. Tom Hanks does well portraying a child in an adults body, except that at some stages he seemed to act more like a nine year old than a thirteen year old. It was very well directed. It was completely original. The movie is very unbelievable. But I think that it's supposed to be unbelievable. Tom Hanks is an amazing actor. If you liked Tom Hanks in this movie then you will like him in movies such as You've Got Mail and Turner and Hooch. If you also enjoy dramas  recommend Saving Private Ryan, Philadelphia and Forrest Gump. It was also nice to see Elizabeth Perkins in Big. I recommend this movie to all comedy lovers.",Big

This movie only lives by it's actor Tom Hanks, who in reality isn't that great of an actor. Nicholas Cage and John Travolta, who're multi-talented, where they can do any role and pull it off, Tom Hanks, can't. Sorry.What sickens me is, that the movies that make people want to watch them repeatedly; well this movie doesn't do it for me. The white collar comedy lovers must not like the blue collar comedies. Movies which I've mentioned before like Dumb and Dumber, The Comebacks, Meet The Spartans. Comedy movies were intended to make you laugh. Make you forget your bad day at work or school or from a bad date. The same people who're so eager to say negative things about movies that are comedy and hard worked on; ""they never ever have bad comments"" about movies, that are actually, ""bad"".

It's a very hard job to act like a kid and not look like you're acting, but Tom Hanks does a superb job. I'm not exaggerating, I'm not saying this just because Tom Hanks is my favorite actor. He really looks credible through the entire movie.To conclude, if you haven't seen this movie yet, i strongly recommend you do.",Big

It is the perfect movie to watch with any member of the family because you can relate to it regardless of your age. It captures very cleverly the age of innocence and it combines it in an unexpected way with the adulthood. Tom hanks plays a young boy turned into an adult by a strange machine and he learns to deal with his new problems, it seems like you already know the ending , but i can guarantee that this movie will nor fail to surprise you. Before you know it you will dissolve in the story, which not only illustrates the ""coming of age"" emotions, but also love. Big is the perfect example of an impossible and innocent love, which is smoothly contoured by beautiful script and scene. The actors did a very great job and they played every moment with a lot of emotion which kept me very interested to see what was happening next at all times.

166,Honeybee-ct,The world through a child's eyes...,9,19 November 2015,"This movie makes you question and realise how you lose, or rather inhibit, your inner child as you get older to be able to fit into sociably acceptable roles. There is such great free child energy and it makes you realise how different perspectives of the world can create such major issues in life. It also makes you see the difference between a child's view of the world and an adult. A child is ignorant and doesn't know certain etiquette of adult behaviour, and doesn't care about what others think, never trying to impress anyone but himself. The fact that she falls for him, made me think that she was attracted to the child in him, and the freedom of life that he shows because of his lack of maturity. Personally I think she was attracted to him because he hasn't been damaged and moulded by the world to fit into a cookie cut adult, he was interesting, different and hadn't been tainted by adult worries or concerns. If only we could all see the world through a child eyes, life would be so much more simplistic, real, pure and enjoyable.",Big
167,charliellane-1,Big is bigger than most,10,11 March 2008,"t's an odd plot, toogrown-up bodies inhabited by children's minds. Rather curious that has come up so often lately: Dudley Moore's Like Father Like Son, Judge Reinhold's Vice Versa, and now Tom Hanks in Big. Hanks is the best comic actor (as opposed to comedian) among the three stars. So while Big is not an uproarious hoot from start to finish, it has a little more human depth than its predecessors.Big gets help, too, from an appealing performance by co-star Perkins. She and Hanks make an interesting and sympathetic couple. Their relationship makes us look beyond the wild improbability of the basic story and appreciate them as people caught up in a difficult situation.Hanks makes the most of the opportunities for physical comedy that the role provides. He is very funny as an over-grown pre- teenager.When the story turns more serious, in the last section, he's still effective and still 100 percent in character. A little more of the humor and energy from the first third of Big would have helped cut the last third overly tone. But by that time we're in the mood to be very happy about these characters, and the way the story's been set up, it can't help but have a bittersweet ending.",Big

The support acting of Elizabeth Perkins as Joshes love interest, Robert Loggia as his boss and farther figure, Jared Rushton as Joshes best mate and somewhat more street wise character than Josh, and last but not least a brilliant performance from John Heard as Joshes nemesis. The way Hanks always undermines him with a childish comment or a look of innocence is captivating, and the dialogue between the two at times is mesmerising.I would recommend this film to anyone because I think this is one of those rare movies that transcends all genres and boundaries, a movie to be enjoyed by all.",Big

Only problem is: he wakes up as a 30 year old, and that's when Hanks comes in. His mother thinks he's a robber and he's kicked out of the house. He feels he wants to go back to being younger, but the Zoltar is in New York. He goes with his younger friend, Billy, to New York City, where he gets a job as a toy seller. He soon falls for a (Elizabeth Perkins).This is probably one of Tom Hanks' best films. He does a fantastic job playing Josh. There is a very memorable scene in the film. The other actors do good too, but Hanks steals the show.The film gets emotional toward the end as Josh wants to go back to being younger but he doesn't want to leave Susan.

It is cleverly acted (we can all be childlike at times and the 'adults' in this film prove that in various ways) with a big thumbs up for Tom Hanks as Josh who pulls off his 12 year old's character persona very well indeed.The film also includes a bona-fide classic moment with 'chop-sticks', and is well worth watching just for that moment.  (Anyone who wonders what is meant by 'chop-sticks' - WATCH THE FILM!!!  I don't want to spoil it for you!)Although Tom has gone on to bigger films, you will not find one much better than this.  A sheer delight!",Big

I wonder where is that carelessness, fun, love for sports, games have gone! and why is that so? This movie made me think that. Tom Hanks one of my all time favorite actor with a fine piece of acting in this flick. The kid grows up, hunts for a job, falls in love, does good in his career and then comes back to real world. The movie takes all over to a fairy world where anything is possible. The movie is very well directed showing around two different eras in one life. At the end of the movie, both of the lead actors do not see the WISH, I thought there would be something which will take the actress as well back in young age, but that does not happen this way. It touches your heart in and out. one word, BRAVO!",Big

Rejected by his family and friends, he has to survive alone in the 'real' world.The boy learns how tough the world can really be, and the adults around him learn to cherish the innocence of childhood. The value we place on work, romance and friendship are all considered here.

Several questions arise from this boy's request. How big? Immediately? Why would he do this? Does he want to prepare himself for adulthood by...being one?Cut to the scene halfway through in a huge New York toy store. It's a place where a kid's dreams are realised. Tom Hanks dances across a piano with the owner who found a valuable commodity within the seeming juvenile grown man. Alongside with when he touches the breast and attends a company party in a white tux, this is the film's most memorable scene. The scene on the boardwalk is dramatic and beautiful too.This is a film about the romance of childhood and romance itself.Picture this: getting out of your bunk bed and being a 'different person' and not being able to convince your mum that it's you. This has elements of a horror movie.I think it's unrealistic (Ironic as the whole premise is unrealistic)that he turns back into a kid immediately when he was waving though!

This movie gives a very lively scenes which makes one imagine themselves as a kid again. For example how kids use to love to play with toys instead of now playing computers and watching television, but this movie shows that no matter how old one is they should still not be to serious sometimes and enjoy life. i think that tom hanks did a well job playing the role of being in a man's body but acting like a kid and i think acting like a kid is a really fun thing to do when your a 30 year old man because it brings back memories of how adults live their life now all serious and barely having much fun like how they use to when they were kids.",Big

Even though it was the second time that I have watched the movie it felt like the first. I enjoyed the film and would definitely recommend it to my friends. I feel that Tom Hanks portrayed Josh's ""adult innocence"" in a great way and the transition he made from being a timid and scared adult in the beginning to acting like a ""normal"" adult near the end was very well portrayed. If I had to choose an age to be, I think I would want to return to the past and be in primary school again. Perhaps around the age of 10, as that was the year I had the best school teacher and the year my best friend and I became best friends. I feel that back then life was a lot less complicated and stressful. Never the less we are where we are and who we are today because of the experiences we have had (good or bad) and the people who have guided us along the way and I ,personally, would not want to change any of that.",Big

I also think that Jared Rushton's performance in the movie is great, and I laugh sometimes because it sometimes seems that Tom Hanks is the adult acting like a kid and Jared Rushton is the kid acting like an adult.

203,toffeefan,This movie captures the innocence of youth beautifully,10,12 August 2002,"I saw this film again yesterday for what must now be the tenth or so time and it's a film that makes me stop whatever I'm doing and immerse myself in the unfolding story. Never mind the fact that I am by now familiar with the premise, which incidentally far exceeds similar ones of the genre released at this time - Vice Versa and 18 Again (the latter being truly dire).I think this is one of Hanks' finest hours and see it as the pinnacle of his early pre-90's career. His later performance in Philadelphia would eclipse this role, although this was obviously more serious in its message.It takes real talent to act the young boy in the body of a thirty something and Hanks' copes admirably, from the comical leaping around the bedroom when he is trying to put on the jeans of the child on discovering his transformation to the child-like reaction displayed on Perkins' advances toward him. He captures the essence of youthful innocence both in the company of his younger peers and older 'work' colleagues.Elizabeth Perkins complements the performance of Hanks' and it seems a shame that on searching the database that her career perhaps hasn't mirrored the success of Hanks' since making 'Big'.I don't know why, but I always shed a tear at the end of the film. Perhaps it is the longing in all of us to want to return to the days of our youth and that we cannot turn back the clock as one can in the imaginary world of film.As I grow older, and watch my children grow-up it makes me realise that time is a precious commodity and that life is a gift that should be cherished and nurtured carefully. This film somehow reinforces these feelings.",Big
204,cfurness-1,"Excellent movie, never tire of seeing it over again.",8,15 February 2003,"Tom Hanks is ""big"" in this film about a boy who's wish to be big is granted overnight.  This presents problems when his mother doesn't recognize him and he has to leave home to calm her and try to figure out how to live as a boy in an adult body.  Elizabeth Perkins is wonderful as Tom's co-worker who becomes attracted to him because of his honesty and innocence.  Robert Loggia fits his role perfectly as Tom's boss who is interested in Tom's unique insight into the marketing of new toys.  Penny Marshall did a great job of directing this early Tom Hanks film, and the dance scene with Tom and Robert on the giant musical keyboard is a real gem.  This is a good family film and sparks the imagination of both young and old alike.",Big
205,mathwiz73,Josh wishes to be big because he was excluding from a ride at a carnival,8,11 November 2010,"I think this was a good movie but some of it was unrealistic. Josh wants to ride a roller coaster, but does not meet the minimum height requirement, so he makes a wish to be big. Josh is supposed to be 12 going on 13. The average height for a 12 year old is about 60 inches. It is very uncommon for a roller coaster to have a minimum height requirement above 54 inches. 54 inches is about average for a 10 year old. Either Josh would need to be extremely short for his age, or the ride would need to have an uncommonly high minimum height requirement. David Moscow did not appear to be under 54 inches tall, so the only implication would be that the ride possibly had a 60 inch minimum height requirement. Very few rides have that kind of height requirement because it would be bad for business. The owners of the amusement parks are well aware that having a height requirement above 54 inches would anger a lot of people, so the biggest minimum height requirement for rides is generally 54 inches or less. Thus, it is highly unlikely that someone who is almost 13 would have a problem getting on a ride at an amusement park. Therefore, the scene where Josh can't get on a ride due to not meeting the height requirement does not seem very realistic. There is the scene where Susan tells Josh that she wants to spend the night at his apartment, but he takes it to mean a sleepover party. Most people at that age would know that the woman is talking about having sex and not a sleepover party. Most 12 and 13 year olds do not play with little kiddie toys. There are some scenes where Josh Baskin acts more like a younger kid rather than a teenager. Josh does not seem like he is interested in doing things that a kids are restricted from. Most teens would jump at the opportunity to participate in adult activities if they had the chance, but Josh opts to participate in kid activities. Most kids are very anxious to drive and would drive at a much earlier age than 16 if it were up to their own free will. I remember at the age of 10 arguing with one of my school teachers about whether I would be capable of driving and being very upset that min age was 16. Most 12 or 13 year olds would be ecstatic if they looked old enough to drive and take advantage of this opportunity. Josh did not show any interest in driving a vehicle. A normal kid that became an adult temporarily would have taken driving lessons, driven a vehicle, then bragged to the other kids about knowing how to drive.There is the scene where Josh plays a person who has just been hit and rolls around on the floor. One of the authors made a comment that a normal kid would argue about whether it was a hit or miss. Though kids do tend to argue with each other, there are some kids that can play games without cheating and have fun. Kids are much less likely to argue with adults than other kids. Even though Josh is a kid, the kids he is playing with would see him as an adult, and be less inclined to argue with him. Thus, Josh would be less inclined to argue with them.Then, there is the part of the movie where Josh blows off his best friend, Billy. His personality changes and he starts acting like the other adults at his work. At that point, Josh loses interest in becoming a child again. Then out of frustration, Billy reminds Josh that he is still a kid and not an adult. At that point, Billy had decided that he wasn't going to bother giving Josh the location of the Zoltar machine. He changes his mind when he sees the anguish Josh's mom is going through over her son being missing and decides to give Josh the location. After doing some thinking, Josh realizes that he is not ready to be an adult yet and decides he wants to go back to being a kid.When Josh tells his girlfriend, Susan, that he is a 13 year old trapped in an adult body, she doesn't believe him. She thinks Josh is just trying to avoid responsibility. Then when she gets to the carnival she seems to realize that Josh was telling her the truth. I suspect that at that point, she actually believed that Josh believed he was a boy, but was delusional. She asked Josh if he was 15 or 16. Josh did not act like he was anywhere close to being 15 or 16. I suspect she wanted Josh to be older, so she would feel better about the relationship she had with him. I think Susan was just going along with what Josh said at the carnival because she knew that Josh truly believed he was a kid trapped in a man's body, but thought he was delusional. I don't think she truly thought he was a kid until she actually saw him change with her own eyes. It must have been a very shocking moment for her. Overall this is a funny movie, and Tom Hanks did do a good job playing an innocent 13 year old trapped inside an adult body. The character had many child like qualities. I suspect there are lots of adults that would like to act like children, but restrain themselves out of fear of embarrassment. The movie basically portrays the message that it is good to be childlike and not take life too seriously.",Big

He has, as every one knows, gone on to play several major roles over the years but this early film clearly shows his budding talent, as he is thrust into the adult world without much warning! I think a lot of young boys have dreamt about being BIG at some point in the 'groaning up' years and overall this handles the theme quite well.

207,jrunner-612-770850,Tremendous Comedy and Movie,8,19 February 2013,"What happens when a boy makes a wish to an old carnival machine? A problem generally will arise. The problem twelve-year-old Josh Baskin faces in this original and clever comedy is that he is trapped in a thirty-year-old man's body after he makes his wish to be big. Big is an entertaining movie that has an admirable plot with great actors and other features.After waking up the morning after he makes his wish and realizing that he is no longer his recognizable young self, Josh must find a way to convince someone that he is really himself. After he convinces his friend Billy, who is still a boy, they venture into New York City where he is forced to look for a source of income. He finds a job working with computers for a big toy company, but after the president of the company sees how young at heart he is, he gets promoted and gets to play with toys and games. One of the most memorable scenes in the movie, and that ultimately helps Josh get the promotion, is when adult Josh and his boss start playing a giant piano in a toy store. While he is at the company, Josh wins the heart of a co-worker with his young person attitude. After a while, Josh starts to miss his parents and his old life as a kid. Adult Josh Baskin is played by top notch actor Tom Hanks. Hanks did an incredible job bringing the curious, enthusiastic, and naïve out of the kid adult. He is supported by Elizabeth Perkins who plays his girlfriend and co-worker, Susan, and Jared Rushton who is his young friend Billy. Young Josh is played strongly by David Moscow. The actors picked to star in the movie were great finds as they really did a great job making the movie. I felt they really had chemistry and the parts just seemed to fit them all in this unique movie.This movie has a great and unique storyline to it. The writers did a great job making the script and storyline for this movie as original as possible. Production of the movie was well done, was very easy to follow, and did not contain any confusing parts where the viewer could get lost. The problem faced by Josh was very creative and it seems to convey a message about life as the story progresses. All the drama and emotions of the film build up as Josh becomes more and more like an adult and all you can do is wonder what he is going to do while laughing at the same time. The music in this film was picked out well as it really enhanced the film. It put suspense in spots, added to the comedy in others, and helped you interpret what the characters were thinking in others.This movie was a spectacular production with a good cast that had great chemistry to really enhance all the qualities of the film. It was very well put together and is a tremendous movie that should be a classic. Big was a very unique and creative comedy that will keep you laughing from the beginning to the end of the movie.",Big

I've lost count of the amount of times people have asked me things like ""What's your favourite film"" or ""Name your ten favourite films of all time"" ..... I can never answer the former , for some reason i can't quite fathom . I guess that , although i DO love films , though they entertain me , make me think , sometimes keep me enthralled for 2 or three hours , none really seem to touch me deeply . Which is strange .... many seem to think . Yet ""Big"" really touches me . I'm a 26 year old man and a kids' film gets me every time i watch it *grins* I'm pretty sure why i love ""Big"" so much - and why i've always loved it . It's because i have a big ole kid inside me and , like Josh (Tom Hanks) my inner kid really isn't all that concealed . I love the thought that one doesn't have to be afraid to be kooky , goofy , child-like .... whatever you wanna call it . During the film , i walk around with Josh , i see what he sees . How he walks around in this so called ""adult world"" where everyone frowns at one another and is afraid to really express themselves - that is until he meets Susan , the seemingly frosty (but very warm hearted girl who works for the toy company Josh works for) and his boss MacMillan (played superbly as a wise but fun loving grandfather figure) Josh helps Susan to reveal the little girl inside that that has struggled to keep herself hidden in her bitter , pressure cooker ""grown up"" environment . We see that , despite initial appearances , Josh is NOT the real BIG kid in the film - it's those around him - from the greasy manager of the zero star hotel that Josh checks into on his first day away from his familial home , and the various unseen miscreants that can be heard but not seen in and around the hotel , to the cruel , backstabbing and ultimately childish Paul (John Heard) who will apparently do anything to succeed and gain prestige in the toy company Susan and Josh also work for. I've also been a big kid and i dare say i always will - and that's why ""Big"" , for me , will never , ever seem outdated (maybe in a similar way that James Stewart's ""It's a wonderful life"" has always burned so brightly in the hearts and minds of a universe of film lovers)and , even as a senile old codger , if asked ""What is your favourite film of all time"" , i'll still remember to answer (and mostly emphatically , ""Big !!"" =oD",Big
