0,bkoganbing,"""When The Moon Hit's Your Eye""",9,30 August 2020,"I'm sure a pretty penny mst have been paid to Paramount by MGM/UA for the rights to That's Amore. Both sung over the beginning and end credits of Moonstruck, the song beautifully frames the entire film.Seeeing it when it first came out and again 33 years later Moonstruck is as fresh
as when it first came out. It could be made again today because the characters created are timeless. Writer John Martin Shanley learned his Brooklyn well for his Oscar winning original screenplay. What you see albeit with some supplementary footage from Toronto is the Italian neighborhood of Carroll
Gardens and a real Cammareri Bakery. Sadly it went out of business and
Carroll Gardens is now gentrfied a whole lot.It should be a happy day for the Cammereris and Castorinis. Danny Aiello the
older Cammereri brother has proposed marriage has proposed marriage to Cher the only child of the Castorinis, Vincent Gardenia and Olympia Dukakis.
But Aiello has to go back to the old country and vist Mama. But he wants to
have Cher invite his brother Nicholas Cage to the wedding. There's been some
bad blood between the brothers, but Aiello hopes things will be straightened
out.As the That's Amore goes when the moon hits your eye crazy things start happening. Cher and Cage discover their attraction and both Gardenia and
Dukakis have memorable nights with other people Anita Gillette andJohn Mahoney. But the family comes together when all's said and done.In addition to Best Original Screenplay Moonstruck gave career roles for Cher
and Olympia Dukakis and Oscars fpr Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress
respectively. It's a deserved classic.Best seen in Autumn under that big harvest moon. Why? Cause That's Amore.",Moonstruck
1,SnoopyStyle,wonderful rom-com with great performance from Cher,8,18 May 2014,"Loretta Castorini (Cher) is a reserved 37 year old bookkeeper who was widowed years earlier. Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) is nice guy who she bosses around. She doesn't really love him. She believes that her first marriage was cursed and she wants to do the wedding right this time. Her father (Vincent Gardenia) thinks her marriage will be cursed, and her mother (Olympia Dukakis) is glad that she doesn't love him. They invite Ronny Cammareri (Nicolas Cage) who is Johnny's younger brother estranged from him for the last five years. Ronny works at the neighborhood bakery and is wildly passionately tormented blaming his brother for losing his hand. He sets off an intense love affair that threatens to open Loretta's dormant heart.It's a light quirky Norman Jewison film. The characters are Italian stereotypes. None of it is mean-spirited. It's all fun and light-hearted. Everybody is very charming. I like Cher playing an understated character for her. She has great chemistry with Cage. There is an inherit likability about everybody in this movie. The wild romanticism is hilarious and it's a very sweet odd romantic comedy.",Moonstruck
2,mark.waltz,"If only for the Bird's Nest Breakfast I learned from this film, it would still be a good egg.",9,2 January 2018,"When a bit of Dino wakens you up after a ton of previews followed by the MGM lion's roar, you know that's amore as you enter the Brooklyn neighborhood of sultry widow Cher and her outrageous family. She's sending her fiancee Danny Aiello off to Italy to visit his dying mama and promises to visit his estranged brother (Nicolas Cage) to get him to come to their wedding. Cage blames Aiello for the loss of his hand, distracting him while cutting bread and losing the woman he loved in the process. The embittered Cage, obviously adored by his female co-workers, perhaps isn't worthy of all that love, but it's obvious he needs a bit of mothering, being estranged from the elderly woman back in Italy. Cage manages to ""snap out of it"" long enough to seduce Cher (""OK. Take me to the bed. I don't care""), and then to the Opera at Lincoln Center, even causing her to darken the gray coming in. Cher plays kick the can as she returns home, only to find Aiello has returned and missing money from her job working for relatives. It's a luscious and subtle romantic comedy that, like the moon, will hit your eye like a big pizza pie.This isn't all about Cher who was at the height of her film fame, appearing in the courtroom drama ""Suspect"" and dark horror comedy ""The Witches of Eastwick"" the very same year, winning an Oscar for this and going from camp music star to serious actress. She is the lead in an ensemble which she shares generously, with plaudits going to on-screen parents Vincent Gardenia and Olympia Dukakis. If being Archie Bunker's neighbor on ""All in the Family"" wasn't enough, Gardenia is a delightful curmudgeon who may love his wife, but still isn't any less of a man for having a woman on the side (Anita Gillette, ultra middle aged chic in her showy but small role), and he too gets hit in the eye as he has to decide himself what is more important: his male ego or the woman who has stood by him through thick and thin. I had already known whom Olympia Dukakis was when I saw this in the theater, having thought her very unique when she appeared on the soap opera ""Search For Tomorrow"". It is Dukakis who introduced me to the ""Bird's Nest"", a breakfast dish where the center of a huge chunk of bread is cut out so an egg can be dropped in the center and fried along with the bread. Dukakis is loving, no-nonsense, and absolutely loyal to her marriage, even if she secretly knows that her husband is stepping out on her.Even if you are estranged from family, I doubt you will not feel the love inside this adorable family, almost operatic in its passion for each of the members. Although they fight, it is with love, and you can tell that every member of this family is on each other's side, even when they make mistakes. It holds up 30 years after its release completely. Minor characters all have moments that show their passion which doesn't diminish as they pass middle age. Even the cantankerous grandfather who has old fashioned morals that make him disgusted by what he sees (a moment between daughter-in-law Dukakis and a complete stranger that he misinterprets) speaks through his eyes without uttering a word, and various other relatives are included by having little moments where their own hopes, dreams, desires and failings are exposed. An aging Sicilian matron putting a curse on her sister as Cher watches Aiello take off for Italy gets the ball rolling. This is Sicily and the Italian mainland New York 1980's style, and anybody who has a large ethnic family, whether Italian or not, can relate to these character's personalities. It is one of the best original screenplays ever written, directed passionately by Norman Jewison, very much in the style of Woody Allen (particularly ""Hannah and Her Sisters"" and ""Radio Days""), yet standing out as a fresh viewpoint that time hasn't yet stamped out.",Moonstruck
3,gavin6942,Nicolas Cage,7,3 November 2015,"Loretta Castorini, a book keeper from Brooklyn, New York, finds herself in a difficult situation when she falls for the brother of the man she agreed to marry (the best friend of her late husband who died seven years previously).So, you know, maybe I was just too young, but Nicolas Cage did not register for me until the early-to-mid 1990s. And yet we have him in ""Vampire's Kiss"" and in a prominent role here, being somewhat quirky and somewhat sweet (he plays the melodramatic very well).I will have to re-think the way I look at Nicolas Cage. The 1980s were a decade of great roles for him, and more than just a prelude to his later success. Sure, we can ignore his bit part in ""Fast Times"", but how can we forget ""Moonstruck""?",Moonstruck
4,lee_eisenberg,so-so moon rising,6,9 May 2018,"Norman Jewison has spent most of his career addressing social issues in his movies (In the Heat of the Night, Fiddler on the Roof, Other People's Money, The Hurricane) while taking the occasional break for straightforward entertainment. ""Moonstruck"" falls into the latter category. Cher plays a woman who falls for her fiance's younger brother. It was odd that the director of ""Rollerball"" directed this. It's not a bad movie, just nothing spectacular. As for the Academy Award wins, I'd say that Olympia Dukakis rightfully earned hers, while Cher's performance wasn't as impressive as Glenn Close in ""Fatal Attraction"". Screenwriter John Patrick Shanley also wrote the play ""Doubt"", whose screen adaptation - starring Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams - he directed; he also directed the Tom Hanks comedy ""Joe vs the Volcano"".Anyway, it's an enjoyable movie. Just don't expect anything profound. I'm just not into romantic comedies.So yes, do snap out of it.I'd like to go inside that bakery and see them make the bread.",Moonstruck
5,jboothmillard,Moonstruck,8,5 June 2006,"From Oscar nominated director Norman Jewison (In the Heat of the Night, The Thomas Crown Affair, Fiddler on the Roof), I watched this film again when it was on television, a week after the leading singer/actress celebrated her 75th birthday, and the supporting actress sadly passed away aged 89 earlier the same month. Basically, Italian American widow Loretta Castorini (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Cher) lives in Brooklyn and works as a bookkeeper. Her slightly dull middle-aged boyfriend Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) proposes to her before leaving for Sicily to be with his dying mother. Loretta insists they have a traditional, as she believes her first marriage was cursed, resulting in the death of her husband two years when he was hit by a bus. Johnny asks Loretta to invite his estranged younger brother Ronny to the wedding. Loretta lives with her parents, father Cosmo (Oscar nominated Vincent Gardenia), mother Rose (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Olympia Dukakis), and paternal grandfather (Feodor Chaliapin Jr.). Returning home, Loretta informs them of the engagement. Cosmo dislikes Johnny and is reluctant to pay for the ""real"" wedding. Rose is pleased that Loretta does not love Johnny; she believes that she could easily be hurt by a partner whom she loves. The next day, Loretta looks for Ronny (Golden Globe nominated Nicolas Cage) at the bakery he works, he reveals that he has a wooden prosthetic hand and blames Johnny, causing him to be distracted and his fiancée leaving him. Loretta insists that they discuss things in his apartment, where she cooks a meal. She tells Ronny that she believes he is a ""wolf"" who cut off his own hand to escape the trap of a bad relationship. Ronny initially reacts furiously, then passionately kisses Loretta, carrying her to his bed, where they make love. Meanwhile, Rose's brother Raymond (Louis Guss) and his wife Rita (Julie Bovasso) join Rose and Cosmo for dinner, they wonder where Loretta is. That night, the couples look out of the window to see a large bright moon in the sky, just like one Raymond recalls seeing when Cosmo was courting Rose. The following morning, Ronny tells Loretta that he loves her, but she slaps Ronny and tells him they can never see each other again. Ronny promises to never bother Loretta again if she joins him to attends an opera at the Met. She goes to church to confess her sins, including her infidelity. After leaving, she goes to a hair salon and buys a new evening gown and shoes from a boutique. Loretta is deeply moved by her first opera, Puccini's La bohème. As they leave, she sees her father, together with his girlfriend, Mona (Anita Gillette), she confronts him about cheating on her mother. As Loretta is with Ronny, he suggests that they agree that they did not see each other at all. Loretta tries to return home, but Ronny desperately persuades her into another night together. That same night, Rose decides to go to dinner alone in a restaurant and sees a college professor, Perry (John Mahoney), being dramatically dumped by a female student. Rose invites him to dine with her and they have a good conversation and laugh together. She allows Perry to walk her home, but she decides not to invite him because she is loyal to her marriage, and he graciously leaves. Later, Johnny unexpectedly returns from Sicily after his mother's ""miraculous"" recovery and arrives at the Castorini house. Loretta is not home, and Rose asks him for his opinion on why men chase after women and agrees that it is because they fear death. Returning home next morning, Loretta is distressed to learn from Rose that Johnny will be back. Rose assures Loretta that she already knows Cosmo is cheating on her. Ronny arrives, and Rose invites him for breakfast over Loretta's objections. Cosmo and his father emerge from upstairs; Grandpa insists that Cosmo agree to pay for Loretta's wedding. Rose then confronts Cosmo and demands that he end his affair; he is upset but gives in and agrees to go to confession. Both reaffirm their love for each other. Raymond and Rita arrive, concerned that Loretta had not deposited the previous day's takings at the bank, and are relieved to learn that she merely forgot and still has the money. When Johnny finally arrives, he says that his mother recovered after he told her that he was engaged. But he breaks off the engagement, superstitiously believing that their marriage would cause his mother's death. Loretta berates Johnny for breaking his promise and throws the engagement ring at him. Seizing the moment, Ronny borrows the ring and asks Loretta to marry him, and Johnny realises the relationship they have formed in his absence. Loretta happily agrees and the family toast the happy couple with champagne, with Johnny joining, as he will be part of the part of the family after all. Also starring Leonardo Cimino as Felix, Paula Trueman as Lucy, and Batman Forever's Joe Grifasi as Shy Waiter. There is a tiny bit of me that would have preferred that Glenn Close had won the Oscar for Fatal Attraction, but Cher does indeed prove that she is a credible actress with her charming and feisty performance, Dukakis gets some scene-stealing scenes as the feisty mother, and Gardenia is interesting as the father having an affair. It is simple story of a widowed woman falling for the brother of the man she is meant to be marrying, the script is full of witty dialogue, the acting is good, there are bits that genuinely made me titter, and it is sweet, a fun and watchable romantic comedy. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated for Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Score for Dick Hyman and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical and Best Screenplay. It was number 96 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""Snap out of it!""), it was number 17 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, and it was number 41 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!",Moonstruck
6,ccthemovieman-1,"Sounds Like A TV Commercial, But This Real Italian Flavor!",7,31 October 2006,"This was a pleasant surprise and real oddity - a story about an excitable modern-day Italian family (the ""Castorini"" family) - with very little bad language. Amazing! Not just because of the situations but because it's 1980s Hollywood. It's still not one of those ""fun for the whole family movies"" as affairs and other sexual escapades are going on, but overall I thought it was a pretty nice story.Now, I did question the loyalty when a woman (Cher), the first time she meets her finance's brother (Nicolas Cage), goes to bed with him! (At least she winds up marrying him. Then, later in the movie, the father (Vincent Gardenia) of this Castorini family is having an affair and his wife (Olympia Dukakis) finds out about it. She simply tells him, ""Don't see her anymore,"" and that's the end of that. Whether he did or not, who knows, but I guess that says something for forgiveness. Anyway, for a movie labeled ""cute"" by a number of people, it's a too liberal on social issues but what movie in Hollywood the past half century isn't? The lack of profanity helped make up for questionable morals here and there. I enjoyed the Italian flavor in this film. You really get a sense of Italian family atmosphere in here.",Moonstruck
7,moonspinner55,"Back in old Napoli, that's amore...",9,9 September 2001,"Deliriously romantic comedy with intertwining subplots that mesh beautifully and actors who bounce lines off each other with precise comic timing, a feat that is beautiful to behold. When Cher's spineless fiancé asks her to help him make peace with his estranged, moody younger brother, no one could dream the consequences which follow. Operatic symbolism, Catholic church confessions, love bites and falling snow...""Moonstruck"" is timeless and smooth. It takes about 15 minutes for the picture's rhythm to kick in (there's an early sequence with the grandfather and his dogs at the cemetery that's a little rough, and a following scene with Cosmo and the elderly man at the gate that seems obtuse), but the patchwork of the plot is interwoven with nimble skill, and the movie's wobbly tone and kooky spirit are both infectious. ***1/2 from ****",Moonstruck
8,preppy-3,"Beautiful, romantic",8,8 September 2000,"Wonderful romance comedy drama about an Italian widow (Cher) who's planning to marry a man she's comfortable with (Danny Aiello) until she falls for his headstrong, angry brother (Nicholas Cage).  The script is sharp with plenty of great lines, the acting is wonderful, the accents (I've been told) are letter perfect and the cinematography is beautiful.  New York has never looked so good on the screen.  A must-see primarily for Cher and Olympia Dukakis--they're both fantastic and richly deserved the Oscars they got.  A beautiful, funny film.  A must see!",Moonstruck
9,Calicodreamin,Okay. Kind of weird.,5,22 July 2019,"Not sure I get what the point of this movie is, I get the plot (pretty simple) but I don't get why any one felt the need to make this movie. The characters dont have any depth, most of the jokes don't hit and rely too much on the audience to get the irony, and the dialogue felt forced.
But great movie moment in ""SNAP OUT OF IT""",Moonstruck
10,evanston_dad,Howling at the Moon,8,20 June 2008,"A low-key and charming family comedy about a spinsterish widow (Cher), who is torn between marrying her stuffy fiancé (Danny Aiello) and his animalistic brother (Nicolas Cage). Cher proves herself to be an immensely warm and likable screen presence, and the film is mostly a star vehicle for her. But she gets terrific support from Vincent Gardenia and Olympia Dukakis, playing her philandering father and world-weary mother, and from a very funny Nicolas Cage, who proves that he once had both charm and talent.The film makes terrific use of ""Musetta's Waltz"" from ""La Boheme"".Grade: A",Moonstruck
11,AlsExGal,I didn't get this film until I married a New Yorker...,7,14 October 2018,"...because as a native and life long resident of Dallas watching this in 1988 the ways of Italian Americans living in New York were completely unfamiliar to me. Now I watch it and go - oh yeah, I get it!Cher is playing Loretta, a 37 year old widow of 7 years who married late for her culture - age 28 - holding out for love only to have her husband get run over by a bus. So when a long time date/friend Johnny Cammareri asks her to marry him, she accepts. As she tells her mother (Olympia Dukakis), she doesn't love him, but she does like him. Then Johnny has to leave town and tells Loretta that he wants her to help him make things right between himself and his brother (Nicholas Cage) who have not spoken for years. And then when these two meet lightning strikes - in a good way - except it's a bad way since Loretta is engaged to Johnny. Loretta's family has problems too. Her mom knows her dad is having an affair although he has no intention of leaving her. A misunderstanding causes Loretta's extended family to think that she embezzled some money, and a professor in a restaurant who is always getting slapped and left by young girls throws some romantic attention the way of Dukakis' character. This sounds like it could be serious, but it is just a sweet romantic comedy and at the same time a family comedy very much steeped in the culture of Italian Americans who never left New York after migrating here and thus retain much of the history of their original homeland in their daily life. There is a hilarious confession, great one liners, a hand lost in some machinery years ago, the opera, and ultimately a woman who decides she is too young at age 37 to go around with the hair of a 50 year old. I think it has aged well.",Moonstruck
12,FlashCallahan,Like a big pizza pie.....,7,15 October 2015,"No sooner does Italian-American widow Loretta accept a marriage proposal from her doltish boyfriend, Johnny, than she finds herself falling for his younger brother, Ronny. She tries to resist, but Ronny lost his hand in an accident he blames on his brother, and has no qualms about aggressively pursuing her while Johnny is out of the country. As Loretta falls deeper in love, she comes to learn that she's not the only one in her family with a secret romance.......Moonstruck is a very odd affair, it's a good film, that goes without saying, but nothing really happens in the film, apart from a few family revaluations that are not that surprising anyway, as you find during the beginning of the second act, there is not one happy member of Cher's Nuclear family.Then the moon comes out and Cher realises that Cage is the one for her. Why? Because he's edgy, he's angry, he's unhinged, and the fact that he more or less forces himself on her makes him irresistible, but then, Aiello is portrayed as a bit of a wet blanket, so,you can't really blame her.But what makes the film so watchable is just how natural the family seem when they are siting around the table eating dinner, or whatever meal it is, and the scene where they are waiting for Johnny to return is an absolute hoot.It's harmless fun, Cher does grieving by adding a little grey to the front of her hair, and Cage is as brilliant as you remember, but you will find yourself wondering at what exact point he got his eyebrows and teeth done.And it also goes to show that My Big Fat Greek Wedding was a cop out, and ripped this film off no end.",Moonstruck
13,namashi_1,A Decent Watch!,6,20 April 2011,"Norman Jewison directed 'Moonstruck' is a decent watch, that also packs in some memorable performances. The Original Screenplay, by John Patrick Shanley, which won an Oscar, is note-worthy.'Moonstruck' tells the story of a unlucky widow, played superbly by Cher, who finds herself stuck between her would-be husband and his angry, yet lovable, brother, played by Oscar-Winning Actor, Nic Cage.The film begins well, and though the writing does dip after a certain point, the culmination comes out as uncomplicated & memorable. Norman Jewison directs this Romantic-Comedy, with great sincerity. Cinematography & Editing are good.Performance-Wise: Cher is Superb in the central role, from start to end. Her Oscar-Win is justified! Nic Cage is likable as a angry yet lovable guy. Olympia Dukakis, in an also Oscar-Winning role, is genuine. Vincent Gardenia is fabulous. Danny Aiello does well. Others lend good support.On the whole, If you don't take it too seriously, you are bound to have a good time.",Moonstruck
14,theowinthrop,As Promising as Moonlight in a Martini,10,3 December 2005,"I don't think that many films (especially comedies) have added memorable, quotable dialog like MOONSTRUCK. I won't illustrate it - you can see a remarkably long list of quotes on this thread - but any film that can make subjects like the defense of using expensive copper piping rather than brass for plumbing purposes into memorable dialog is amazing to me. It is not the only line that pops up and makes an imprint on our memory. How about a restaurant waiter who regrets a planned marriage proposal because it will mean the loss of an old bachelor client? Or a nice, elderly dog fancier encouraging his pack to howl at he moon? Or Perry (John Mahoney's) description of a female student's youthful promise as ""moonlight in a martini"" (my favorite line).MOONSTRUCK is a wonderful example of brilliant script, first rate direction, and a good ensemble cast that fits perfectly. There are other examples (the drama THE OX-BOW INCIDENT is another example, but a grimmer one). Cher, Olympia Dukakis, Vincent Gardenia, Nicholas Cage, John Mahoney, and Danny Aiello are all involved in plots and cross purposes that examine the nature of love, and how to handle it. Is it a good thing to be totally in love? Cher and Cage, at the end, seem to think so, but Dukakis knows that real love drives the individual crazy (and Cage gets a glimmer of realization of this too, when he and Cher argue outside his home after they return from the opera La Boheme). Is infidelity by men a way of avoiding thoughts of death. Dukakis believes so, and (oddly enough - although he is not totally convinced) Aiello. Chance reveals infidelity - Dukakis realizes early that Gardenia's odd behavior is tied to unfaithfulness, and Cher literally stumbles onto Gardenia and his girlfriend at the opera (but Gardenia also stumbles onto Cher's similar unfaithfulness to Aiello). But chance also causes misunderstandings: Fyodor Chaliapin stumbles on Dukakis walking with John Mahoney and thinks that she is having an affair.There are lovely little moments in the film too. Cher's observation about flowers leading to receiving one. Her hearing the argument in the liquor shop and it's resolution. But best is the sequence of Louis Guss and Julie Bovasso as Cher's uncle and aunt Raymond and Rita Cappomaggi and Rita's charming and kind comment to Raymond about the effect of the moonlight on him. It is the sweetest moment of the entire film.It is close to a flawless film. After seeing it over a dozen times in as many years I can only find two points that do not seem as smooth as they should be. When Cher is at Cage's bakery, his assistant Chrissy (Nada Despotovich) mentions how she is secretly in love with Cage, but has been afraid to tell him. Earlier she was slightly snippy towards Cher, who put her in her place quickly. Yet nothing seems done with this potential rivalry. At the same time, the fact that Cher forgets to deposit her uncle and aunt's daily business profits is brought in momentarily in the concluding seven minutes of the film - but just as quickly dropped. Was there supposed to be some plot lines that were dropped, besides one about Cher and Vincent Gardenia working at a homeless man's shelter as penance? It is a small annoyance, but I think it is just based on a desire to see more of this film because it is so very good.",Moonstruck
15,ElMaruecan82,"""Moonstruck"" is not overrated, but sunsets are ...",10,15 May 2011,"Mamma Mia! What an endearing and exquisite romantic comedy  ""Moonstruck"" left me with a gigantic smile and a heart red and shining like a Christmas ball. What more can I ask? Norman Jewison's unpretentious film is like a modest jewel box full of so many small but valuable jewels. I would feel like spoiling the film by using such big words as 'masterpiece' or any superlatives let's just say, that you start watching ""Moonstruck"" with curious eyes and end up wondering if your heart isn't crying while your lips are smiling.On one hand, ""Moonstruck"" is a feel-good movie in the sense that it doesn't use big conflicts before getting more optimistic. The film has no room for bad intentions. It doesn't end as a feel-good movie, the script is confidently positive from beginning to end. Not naive or preachy either, the film invites us to contemplate with a poetic approach, the life of three generations of an Italian American family during two full-moon nights. To those who believe that sunsets are overrated, this is a movie for you. Legend says that full-moon heightens the love inhabiting your hearts and a strange desire strikes men and women: they're literally moonstruck. And this magic strikes Loretta, played by Cher in a delightful performance, and a natural, strong but imperceptible, comedic appeal.On the other hand, ""Moonstruck"" explores the many forms the most beautiful feeling of the world, take regardless of age, social status, whatever. Love as a universal magic sometimes corrupted by the passing of years and fears. A recurring question is asked by Loretta's mother, Rose. The question is ""Why do men chase women?"" The question is simple and despite its depth, the answer really sounds obvious. ""Because they fear death"" And as a man, I got it. Love is one thing, but death is a whole other matter. Men indeed have a tendency of desire to conquest, as to prove themselves they still got it. And the idea of dying with the same women is something almost inconceivable.Never cynical, the film avoids the stereotypical comedies' situations and instead of denouncing, its approach is more magnanimous, more understanding. The mood is too positive to let itself embarked in polemics. We're not here to be shocked by the behavior of Cosmo, Loretta's father, cheating on Rose, but to try to understand, why he's doing this. Of course, Rose plays the role with such a poignant authenticity, a serene majesty making her one of the greatest Italian mamas, we can see why Cosmo seeks some more flamboyant sentimental adventures. But the point is that he's lying to himself, trying to be what he's not, and indeed, after a simple but heartbreaking ""Ti Amo"" from his wife, he swears between two tears, not to see that woman again. He didn't cheat with his wife, he cheated with his life.So did Loretta actually, in one of the funniest, yet unromantic marriage proposals in the restaurant, she says yes, to a priceless touching Danny Aiello as Johnny, her teddy-bear love. She's unsure as the 'Yes' approves the fear of dying alone. As she felt she wasted her previous marriage by waiting before having a child, unknowing that God would betray her by killing off her husband. It's like women are romantic for the same reason men are unfaithful? Or both are just victims by persuading themselves that this is the thing to do. And thanks to Loretta, when the hazard will lead her to Ronnie's, Johnny's bother, played by a boyish yet magnetic Nicholas Cage, we know they'll end up together, but this is not what will happen, but how it will.The film is just too special to embarrass itself with romantic clichés, it's all about characters knowing each other and trying to cook their lives, with love as the special ingredient. When you think of it, all the characters of these charming gallery have someone to love and someone who loved them. At the end, it's just of matter of sincerity and acknowledging. There is something comical but almost sad in the memorable slap Cher gave Cage, shouting ""Snap out of it!"" as she's the one who's in denial, not Cage. After his sincere ""I love you"" he takes the slap without reacting as if he was already victim of one bigger slap in the face, his realization that Loretta is the love of her lave. A slap is painless after a moon strike.Rarely a movie had portrayed the splendor of being in love in such a romantic and tender way, so 'bella' and so universal, without that fashioned cynicism. I'm thinking of the other couple who works in the cheese shop, Raymond and Rose, their complicity is so obvious after so many years, you're almost jealous. The whole film is a tribute to love, and punctuates the plot with little old couple who love each other after many years. In a certain way, ""Moonstruck"" reconciles between two visions of love: traditional, focused on family, built on the past, and modern built on the present, as Ronnie said, which means, with no fear of death anymore.Universally appealing, despite its specific cultural setting, ""Moonstruck"" invites us to rediscovers our own vision of love. If we're married, we dream to become like these old couples with a great family, if we're not, we'd love to end with the right person. It's both traditional and modern, it's unique. ""Moonstruck"" is like a delicious plate of spaghetti served with a sweet rosy wine, under a full moon light, with a warm summer breeze tickling your neck.Cinema provides so many unforgettable atmospheres, ""Moonstruck"" is one of them, floating in pure poetry on its own universe, like the clouds that caress the moon on the night. ""Moonstruck"" creates a universe we'd love to be part of, as we'd love to cheer with this family.Kudos to Jewison, for such a magnificent and beautiful romantic comedy!",Moonstruck
16,paul2001sw-1,Unstriking,6,2 August 2003,"An affectionate look at the live and loves of New York City's Italian community, ""Moonstruck"" is a low key film in spite of slightly over-the-top performances from almost all its cast.  As the plot consists only of a predictable romance, whether you like it depends largely on whether you find tough stoopid Noo Yorkers heartwarming or merely wearisome.  Quite funny in places, but quite how it won all those Oscars is hard to fathom.",Moonstruck
17,bowmanblue,I probably shouldn't review this film,5,15 March 2017,"How much hate would I get if I said that 'Moonstruck' was a 'chick flick' or one that would most likely only be enjoyed by women? Probably quite a lot. I'm sure there are plenty of guys out there who also liked it. Trouble is I'm just not one of them.I'll start by saying that, if I had my way, I'd probably rate this the lowest score possible. However, that's probably a little unfair of me based on how many people regard this as a classic – like my girlfriend – who made me sit through it with her and would undoubtedly rate it the highest score possible. Let me explain – we're both massive fans of Nicholas Cage (even going so far as to watch his more recent output which does tend to leave a lot to be desired). Therefore, I succumbed to sitting through this romantic comedy where Cher agrees to marry one brother, only to fall in love with the other one. I think it's safe to say that I prefer Nicholas Cage's films where he's either got his head on fire or stabbing himself in the heart with a needle while waving flares off the coast of San Francisco.They call this a 'romantic comedy.' Yes, I could see the romance in there. Even though it was painfully obvious to me what the outcome of the film would be. However, I didn't really see any comedy in there. I seem to recall laughing out loud about once at about three quarters of the way through the film. I would say that meant the story was completely unfunny if it wasn't for the fact that my girlfriend was cracking up next to me pretty much the whole way through it.She also enjoyed the way – her words – they 'play on the Italian-American stereotype.' If that means that the characters are complete clichés then I suppose that's true. Everyone (or rather mainly Nicholas Cage) turned their performance up to eleven and was so-over-the-top it was laughable (and that's laughable in not a good way). Everyone just spends the whole movie shouting noisily and making a drama over nothing.Like I said, if you've seen one romantic comedy then you've probably seen this one. There's nothing new here, just louder. However, just because I hated it, doesn't mean that it's not good. I believe there were even Oscars thrown at the film for Cher's (I think!) performance. If you're into this type of film then you'll probably love it. However, if you prefer your leading man running in slow motion away from exploding barrels then as opposed to dressing up in a suit and asking a woman to the opera, then you should probably stick to 'Face Off' (at least now it's my turn to pick the film we watch (most likely something with a title that ends 'of the Living Dead').I'll give 'Moonstruck' a 'mid-range' final score, simply because I should never have watched it to begin with and feel bad for rating something that so clearly has an audience so low (plus my girlfriend will not approve!).",Moonstruck
18,gbill-74877,"Entertaining, especially the older people",7,14 July 2020,"The older people in this film were more interesting to me than Cher and Nicolas Cage, especially Olympia Dukakis, who plays the mother struggling with her husband's infidelity. The film explores love in ways that are charming (the night out at La Boheme, and an older couple getting frisky after looking at the full moon), but also in ways that are pretty clunky (the silly 'wolf in a trap' analogy, and Dukakis repeatedly asking men why they stray). We also get a sympathetic view of a college professor (John Mahoney) waxing poetic about essentially preying on his students, so I'd say the subplots to this are pretty hit and miss.The same can be said of the characters, which border on Italian-American caricatures, and the performances. Cher is solid enough at least when she captures the pragmatism of her character with her matter of fact restraint, but Cage misfires for most of the film, wanting to be dramatic and passionate but overdoing things in ways that seem far from authentic. The silliest moment is when he breathlessly utters ""to the bed"" after sweeping her up into his arms and she asks where he's taking her, and there are several others. The idea that he and Danny Aiello are brothers (the actors were 23 and 54, respectively) was an odd bit of casting as well.The story line that has one brother swooping in on Cher while the other is tending to his dying mother in Italy seems like it would have more passion than it did. It has its moments, but even then, I'm not sure I really felt it. It all feels somewhat packaged. The film then resolves what should be a terrible conflict in a very artificial way to make us feel good, but I guess that's something romantic comedies are always doing. I like the layering in of the relationships of the older married couples, the music from La Boheme, the old guy walking all those dogs, and the street scenes in New York, so don't get me wrong, I was entertained. This is a decent film in the genre, it's just one I would have liked better with a different leading couple.Quote, from Cher's character:

The film is full of symbolism and it has some things to say about family and relationships.

29,robert-temple-1,One of the most perfect romantic comedies ever made,10,22 July 2013,"Everything about this film just works so well. I have just seen it for the third time, after several years. It is as fresh as 'a flower newly plucked'. The quirky, tempestuous zest of the irrepressible Cher fills the film with more fizz than a case of Pepsi. (And no, I don't drink such stuff, but you have to admit it is fizzy, if one ignores the aspartame and other dire threats to health.) Cher plays a wildly independent 'handful', the kind of gal who has true character and is very lovable if you can put up with her. Her husband died some time back and she has not found love again, so she is grumpy, being 37 years old and about to settle for the marital proposal of the feeble mama's-boy played by Danny Aiello, whom she proudly tells her mother she does not love. ('That's good,' says the mother, drolly played by Olympia Dukakis.) Aiello flies off to Palermo to see his mother who is always dramatically dying but never does. Before going, he asks Cher to contact his brother. 'What, you have a brother?' asks the incredulous Cher. Aiello says they have not spoken in five years but he must be invited to the wedding. So Cher goes to a great deal of trouble to locate and invite the brother, who turns out to be the young Nicholas Cage. He is pretty much of a slob to look at, but he is charming and passionate, and they fall in love at first sight. Cage is very good indeed at the part. So romantic complications arise. Meanwhile, Cher's parents are having romantic complications of their own. She also has an eccentric grandfather who lives in the house but is in love with his five dogs, so that's OK. He asks his dogs to howl at the moon, and they do. (The moon keeps recurring in the film and wakes everybody up because it is large and full and stirs the blood.) The screenplay of this film by John Patrick Shanley crackles with lively wit, sending off sparks of laughter and satirical asides like an exposed electric cable thrashing about in a storm. And then at the helm is the amazing Norman Jewison, one of Hollywood's best. So this film is a classic, truly it is. They make such affectionate fun of the New York Sicilian Italian families and their quaint ways. (This would make a lot of sense to Nick Cage, who is a New York Sicilian Italian by origin. As for Cher, she seems to be 'Armenian or something'.) Jews and Italians both have mamas and they understand each other, even though the Jews have the better sense of humour about it all. This film is so continuously hilarious and delightful that any attempt to review it, other than as a stand-up comic, is an insult. Anyone with joie de vivre (I know that's not Italian, but I don't know how to say joie de vivre in Italian, do you?) and a sense of fun, and who knows how to laugh, can only be 'over the moon' about MOONSTRUCK, as I have been all these years, and I'm still howling.",Moonstruck

Set against an iridescent Manhattan skyline, it follows the romantic misadventures of a sensible 38-year old widow (Cher) engaged to marry a man she calls a lamb while falling in love with her fiancé's wolfish younger brother (a miscast Nicholas Cage). The plot might suggest a knockabout bedroom farce, but the film is more an affectionate Italian-American character piece, charming without trying too hard, and with a surplus of idiosyncrasies for such an otherwise unambitious comedy. Cher has her comic timing honed to a reflex, but she has the advantage of strong support from her temperamental Italian family on screen.

Widowed by a freak bus accident, she wiles away the shank of her thirties as a self-employed accountant who lives with her aging family under the skyscrapers of the Big Apple. Just as she readies herself for a loveless marriage with the sweet-but-simple Johnny Cammarini (Danny Aiello), love strikes in the form of Johnny's bitter brother Ronny (Nicolas Cage). Can Loretta do the right thing, even if she doesn't quite know what that is?""Moonstruck"" is a comedy that works in serious themes, like death, infidelity, faith, and hopelessness. Writer John Patrick Shanley operates with a deft hand and an ear for how people say what they really mean even when they try to say something else, like when Loretta's cheating father Cosmo (Vincent Gardinia, along with Cage one of the authentic Italian-American cast members) warns her against marriage because, well, he's cheap and doesn't want to pay for it.Seeing her ring from Johnny is just a pinky ring (Johnny wasn't prepared when he popped the question), Pop complains when she tells him it's temporary: ""Everything is temporary! That don't excuse nothing!""Cher won an Oscar for her performance, which wasn't maybe the best of all performances that year but carries the film ably. I'm not a Cher fan myself, but it's hard not to admire the way she plays Loretta against expectations. She's quiet and subtle when you expect big and loud. Even late in the film, when she undergoes her expected transformation into a glamour queen, she doesn't go all diva about it.""You look beautiful,"" Ronny tells her. ""Your hair.""""Yeah, I had it done,"" she says with a shrug.Cage is the other over-the-top actor here, but he succeeds with that by playing his part more for laughs. He blames Johnny for the loss of his hand and his fiancé, not that it's fair of him and he knows it. ""I ain't no freakin' monument to justice,"" he exclaims.Cage's best work in the movie comes at the end, when he's not talking so much as listening in the background while the other characters have their big confessional moments at the breakfast table. That concluding scene is a showcase of fine comic acting and writing, which director Norman Jewison (another guy who liked to go big in other productions) plays very lightly and well, working the silences as much as the speeches to wry effect.Even the secondary performers, like Feodor Chaliapin as Cosmo's confused father, and Julie Bovasso and Louis Guss as Loretta's aunt and uncle, make their marks. This is a film about family that celebrates all its members.I don't quite buy a central premise of the film, that a man cheats on his wife because he's afraid of death, and feel some of the secondary scenes take up too much time, but there's a simple joy even in those scenes which sticks. Olympia Dukakis, the other Oscar-winner in the cast, has a great scene with Aiello which justifies his character's somewhat superfluous presence.To be in love is to die a little, but dying seems like a small price to pay for the pleasure of love.

34,Steffi_P,"""That crazy moon""",4,22 November 2011,"From The Godfather onwards, the Italian American world was a popular cultural backdrop for movies of all sorts in the 70s and 80s. Most of these were about gangsters (even when they were comedies, as in the 1985 movie Prizzi's Honor), but as Moonstruck shows, there were plenty of other stereotypes to be exploited without resorting to gun-toting Mafiosi.Moonstruck features numerous tropes of Italian culture – vendettas, elderly matriarchs, romantic opera etc., etc., etc Often these are in a satirical light, such as Nicholas Cage's absolutely pathetic excuse for ""bad blood"". But none of this is actually very funny. The movie is really a mess of clichés and crisscrossing romantic subplots, with occasional musings on the nature of love and fidelity, none of which seems quite as intelligent or cohesive as it seems to thinks it is.Cher carries the movie's Italian American cliché through to her performance, which is full of extravagant gesture. She just about keeps the lid on theatricality, and does some fairly good emoting later on, but she was nowhere near deserving of the Academy Award. Nicholas Cage continues his then-current trend of playing the young, pretentious ""tortured soul"", and while he's not outstanding there aren't many actors who could make such a ridiculous figure into a credible romantic lead. Danny Aiello is always fun to see but he is underused here. It is Olympia Dukakis who really gives the picture its only great, solid dramatic performance.Director Norman Jewison directs with an eye towards beauty and eye-catching imagery. Early on, Cher is often duplicated in reflection, concentrating us on her visage. There's a really neat set-up when Cher is on the phone to Aiello, with Aiello's dying mother in the background of one shot and the healthy Dukakis in the equivalent position of the other shot. The whole thing has that wonderful late 80s/early 90s look, of a city glowing in the night, and this is perhaps the only thing I really like about it. That, and the fact that at 100 minutes it is mercifully short. As a romantic movie, it moves me not at all. I speak English and I can even get by in Italian, but for all that it meant to me Moonstruck was incomprehensible.",Moonstruck

He and Johnny haven't spoken each other in five years and Loretta wants to invite him to the wedding. Of course they fall instantly for each other.How this story and love stories of Loretta's parents and uncle and aunt develop is something you simply have to see for yourself. Every seen is a delight to watch, with Cher as the bright star in the middle of everything. She won and really deserved the Oscar that year.

(i.e. Mobsters never appear in acomplication. It never becomes grotesque like My Big Fat Greek Wedding) The secondary story lines are economically told with short scenes that allow a break from the major thread. These are the scenes that are now missing in contemporary movies where their immediate value cannot be impressed upon producers and bigwigs. I miss these scenes. It also beautifully involves older characters. The movie takes it's own slight, quiet path to a conclusion.

She is engaged to marry Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello), a bland man, more out of a resigned duty than actual love. Before their wedding Johnny takes a trip out to visit his mother who is sick and leaves Loretta the function of playing the olive leaf with his brother Ronny by notifying him of their impending wedding. Ronny (Nicholas Cage) hasn't forgiven Johnny for being the cause of his accident which caused him the loss of his hand (and subsequently, his then-bride-to-be), but he does fall for Loretta, and hard. After a heated affair Loretta out of respect for Johnny tries to avoid Ronny, but his dark looks and overpowering masculinity win her over. Meanwhile, Loretta's mother Rose Castorini (Olympia Dukakis) is not only suspecting her husband Cosmo (Vincent Gardenia) is seeing another woman, but is also herself the subject of admiration from a college professor and wonders why do men chase women. Things get complicated when Johnny returns from Sicily to tell Loretta they can't be married.The setup is pure sitcom, but the story, written by John Patrick Shanley with a deep understanding for Italian-Americans living in New York, is genuine: he gets the idiosyncrasies of these people and their day-to-day foibles and quirks, and all of the characters have a deep romanticism that comes through in key moments throughout the story. Loretta, a character hardened by the loss of her husband and knowing her chances of happiness are slim, slowly emerges as a woman who is so swept by the sudden recognition of love she becomes the heroine of La Boheme -- the one who acknowledges the love of the man with the wooden hand (in a clever gender reversal), and Cher inhabits the role and makes it hers and in her own style subtly trades her frumpiness to a deep, dark beauty. Ronny is pure fire and Nicholas Cage exudes masculine power as if he were channeling Marlon Brando. The Castorini's and the Cappomaggi's, counterbalancing the central couple, both express their love for each other in two very crucial moments: the latter couple, on the night of the full moon when Loretta and Ronny consummate their affair -- a rare scene depicting love and intimacy among the elderly --, and the former at a tense moment over breakfast when Rose bluntly reveals, in touching words, that she wants Cosmo to stop seeing his mistress Mona (Anita Gillette).MOONSTRUCK is not only the romantic comedy and date movie of choice, but also a beautiful examination of love and passion among regular people. The ending is a tour de force of emotional impact, the family situation going beyond the momentary complications to cement it in tradition going back to the days of immigrants, and is one that elevates this movie from being just another feel-good movie to a classic. MOONSTRUCK deservedly got its Oscars for Best Writing, Actress, and Supporting Actress, and has proved to grow beyond its time.",Moonstruck

With Johnny absent, Loretta starts dating his hot tempered brother Ronny (Nicolas Cage). Aside from that a taboo relationship runs rampant in Loretta's Italian-American household with the exception of her grandfather and the four dogs if you count them as family.The winner of three Academy Awards and Cher was among one of them. In the finicky world of the Academy Award judges who have had their biases in the past when it came to selecting those they feel deserve Oscar recognition, the committee seemed to have twenty smiles on their faces for a film like this one that could've been easily snubbed by today's standards. I guess they liked the idea that ""Moonstruck"" was saturated with Italian characters that are not linked to any underworld associations. It also seems that the average age group of characters featured in here seems to be over the age of 60. Elder performers in supporting roles seems like a rarity when the movie industry caters more towards younger performers getting more exposure. This is one contributing factor why this movie stands out.The women characters Loretta and her mother Rose (Oscar winner Olympia Dukakis) are the true leaders in their respected households and in their respected relationships. It also helps that the performers are not strangers to one another so non-verbal poses are all the more effective and the dialogue within them run smoothly.Even though this movie may have given Cher tons of accolades in her performance, it didn't transform into a megastar here. Her break came with the 1985 film ""Mask"" which she was badly snubbed by the Oscars. Cher must've had a ten foot smile when she read the script and would've been payed cheap to play this role, let alone winning an Academy Award for her role.The real breakout star here is Nicolas Cage. Along with ""Raising Arizona"" which came out in 1987 as well, truly shows that Cage's specialty is his knack for comedy. His comic timing is spot on and his widened eyes are effective, we see his gift displayed in these types of films. And sure he still continues making lousy action flicks, it's comedy that really exhibits the actor that Cage is and what he could accomplish.Some of the best scenes in ""Moonstruck"" involve around Ronny Cammareri. When Loretta interrogates Ronny about his estranged relationship with his brother, Ronny relinquishes an unexpected emotional outburst. Later we see Ronny buttoned up for the opera a sign where romance is more welcomed than reality.The opera is a form of acting where the voice is the centerpiece of the theatre than the action. It's like giving skilled artisans colouring pencils and activity books and to tell them they can't surpass the segregated lines like the book tells them to. Cage's acting never goes outside the lines once here.The subject of infidelity comes across frequently here in ""Moonstruck"". The uneven account about the infidelity depicted here is that Loretta can get away with it is for her love for Ronny than she is to Johnny. But Rose's husband and Loretta's father Cosmo (Vincent Gardenia) was questioned with non-approval after quietly being with another woman behind her back even though there was never any signs of engaging in intercourse. But Rose still loves Cosmo and their loyalty to each other is what really matters. This is cleverly crafted romantic story with a great cast and an excellent script.",Moonstruck

(PG)Italian-American widow (Cher)--in her late-30s, ""unlucky"" in love, and content to settle--agrees to marry muttonhead Aiello, but then falls for his wild, passionate younger brother (Cage). Unabashedly romantic and good-natured comedy has fine performances (Cher and Dukakis both won Academy Awards), the occasional memorable line or well-constructed vignette, and a sweetly infectious cornball spirit, but there's precious little originality and it doesn't add up to much. Nearly every character is pitched at the level of true-eccentric (if not outright caricature), which makes the experience exhausting before long--the phrase ""shrill ethnic comedy"" comes to mind at times. The abrasively ""cutesy"" tone calms down in the second half, but much of the humor disappears with it; small, patient scenes work best, like the one between Dukakis and Mahoney walking home from a restaurant or with Guss and Bovasso admiring the moon, though Cage's unbridled outbursts in the bakery scene are also quite memorable.

40,Sergeant_Tibbs,The complicated chaos of love in the face of mortality.,7,29 March 2015,"There's something endearing about movies about love that try their hardest to be as unromantic as possible. First the clunkiest proposal you can imagine, nestled in a backdrop of rocky marriages, then the bride-to-be falls in love with the fiancé's brother and the film follows that thread. Sexually charged infidelity as the main plot in a film about love. Fortunately, John Patrick Shanley's tight witty script is what holds it together and it offers profound insight into love in the face of mortality. Love is complicated and Moonstruck encapsulates that chaos. It's a film drenched in its Italian American culture, paired with its operatic score, and that needs an acquired taste. I struggled to feel close to any of the characters, though I empathised with Cher and Nicolas Cage, an unexpected highlight in his most vibrant scenes. I wasn't as impressed with Oscar winners Cher and Olympia Dukakis as I hoped, they're both subdued and a little too much is lost in what they hold back.

Norman Jewison, a fellow Canadian, takes enormous chances with his movies and his casting and it nearly always pays off in movies that are off centre and somehow delicious, as this one is. I have often wondered at the paucity of Cher's acting roles, whether she has chosen to minimize this part of her life or she does not get enough good roles to chew on. I have found her to be a superb actress who can retreat into a role, as in this particular one or be loud and daring and fierce as in ""Mask"". I found the comedic strokes broad at times ( a hair salon called ""Cinderella"")but this was the whole intent of both the writer and director. Nicolas Page plays the angst ridden tenor of opera, all extravagant gestures, at one point demanding a knife so as to slit his own throat. The Brooklyn scenes are magical, this is a Brooklyn under moonlight, romanticized and dramatic, just like opera. All in all a very satisfying film not to everyone's taste by a long shot, I loved the ending, everyone brought together like a Greek Chorus, every part subtly nuanced and blending with the others, the camera pulling away down the hall, leaving the players talking. 8 out of 10.",Moonstruck

43,sharky_55,The snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. Not us!,9,10 December 2016,"Loretta Castorini once tried living in a romantic comedy, but her husband was hit and killed by a bus. Cher's delivery of this revelation renders it almost an afterthought, like the deflated punchline of a poor joke. She's been raised to marry young and for children, and when she defies this natural order and does so for love, the universe sent along a bus to crush her dreams (and her late husband). The opening scenes of Moonstruck detail how detached and impervious she is to the typical attractions of the genre. Loretta is a tight-lipped, business-first accountant, pretty but aging, and a pragmatist at heart. When her boyfriend Johnny obliterates every last convention of proposing, she reacts with deadpan precision as if it was another tax return to file (see how she rattles off her sins at confession, and slips her infidelity in there). Why tempt the gods a second time? New York is a city where strange and magical things can happen, and with 'That's Amore' opening the film, the most Italian song in English ever, serenading the moon-lit skyline, we more than expect it. The interiors of the Castorini home are brought to life with a warm palette, enlarged in an eccentric, sitcom way, with each piece of wooden furniture or rustic appliance telling a whole story in itself. The rooms are cramped and possess an eternal, lived-in quality about them so we see exactly how the family traditions are retained, and how they can squeeze several generations into the same building at once. They stage confrontations around the breakfast and dinner table, with dialogue like questioning jabs at lifestyle choices, and well- meaning intentions going awry. At Christmas, the full moon beckons and these characters come to life. Nicholas Cage enters in a role that no one, not even Loretta, could expect or begin to explain. Cage is infamous for his eccentric wildness, and as he recounts his tale it begins to overcome the facts. It turns out that Johnny ordered a loaf of bread, and in the ensuing distraction Ronny lost not only his hand but also his girl. It's supposed to be tragedy, but Cage renders it a comedy, crying dramatically for a knife to end his life, asking us not to question the bizarre line of thinking that led him to blame his brother. The wooden hand is the cherry on top, revealed in a delirious monologue so deliciously full of irony and self-imposed gravitas that only Cage could ever pull it off, but also make it funny. Later as he tries to persuade Loretta into his bed again, he gives a speech so vehemently trying to subvert conventional romance it doesn't realise it's drowning in clichés. Cage splutters and staggers so often we realise he is making it up as he goes, and finishes with a desperate flourish: ""GET. IN. MY. BED!"". The way he so obviously reaches into the (shallow) depths of his soul will have even the hardest-hearted cynic giggling. Soon the stiff accountant is tossed out the window and diving into bed with her fiance's brother. The soundtrack assists this shift, transforming an indifferent city into one of love and mystery. Listen to how Hyman's flutes and trumpets twist curiously as Loretta shops for something to wear to the opera, and how its inklings of mischief suggest something a little more sexy than her usual costume. Later he uses a sax heavy mood piece as she prepares next to the crackling fireplace, an atmosphere ripped straight from an old-fashioned noir, Loretta shedding her skin to reveal a newer woman. The film's most luminous moment comes when the pair join hands at the opera, and her tears melt away the last of her resistance. Jewison never orientates us with a wide shot, so the moon looms in the background of the stage, casting the same magical spell over the audience as it does to the city, blasting through windows and blinds, making night like day and old men twenty five. The one person immune to this trance is Rose. Dukakis is a great casting because we can immediately see how Loretta retains the same long, angular nose, lean face and no-nonsense approach. While the whole city is under the moon's spell, she's dining alone and searching for answers to her husband's affair. She encounters a regular of the story, and the way the professor switches from preying on young college students to her is so smooth and full of charm that anyone but Rose would have fallen for it. But she knows herself quite clearly. Her character is intricate without ever upsetting the balance of the film - she believes her husband might have a good reason for his disappearances, but won't simply toss aside the decades of marriage when he doesn't. Jewison depicts some of that Cosmo charm with the same peculiar humour that he affords to the whole cast. We see his pitch about different types of metal piping, and the passion in his gestures and insistence on the best material for his customers, and then swings the camera around in a later scene to reveal how he utilises the same showmanship to woo his mistress. In Moonstruck, Jewison takes a strange phrase and diffuses it into the lives of a New Yorker family with uncanny results. Grown men turn into sex-crazed werewolves, old couples are re-energised, and new relationships are grafted. Do we dare question why a man with a wooden hand would work all day in front of an oven? No, because the story is beyond the mere logic of the ordinary and everyday. In the morning-after of the miracle, Loretta skips in her heels and kicks cans, and the opera pipes up to accompany her street waltz although there is no singer in sight, because she is moonstruck. And along the way, we witness how funny and tricky the trials and tribulations of love can be.",Moonstruck
44,SmileysWorld,Love Italian style!,8,6 August 2014,"There's really nothing spectacular about the story here.It's story is very basic and that's the best kind.Cher plays a woman who has been unlucky at love.So much so,that she is afraid to unite with anyone.She agrees to marry Danny Aiello's character out of a sense of pressure from her family,but soon things get complicated after she meets his estranged brother(the great Nicolas Cage).What we end up with is a very comical look at love and all of it's potential complications.It will make you laugh and put a little joy in your heart because after all the chaos,everything ends up exactly where it should,with the proverbial ""happily ever after"" at the end.Great film.",Moonstruck
45,gelman@attglobal.net,Sensationally Funny and Romantic: SPOILERS,9,3 May 2009,"Seeing ""Moonstruck"" after so many years is a reminder of how sweet and sensationally funny this film was when it first appeared. Who knew that Cher could act? Who had ever heard of Olympia Dukakis? Nicholas Cage was the beginning of his career, and Vincent Gardenia and Danny Aiello were not known for their comedic talents, nor was Norman Jewison the director.The only really flat note in this splendid work is ""When the Moon Hits Your Eye Like a Big Pizza Pie, That's Amore,"" a song that is sung too many times in the movie (once is already too many) and that went on to have a long afterlife in popular music. Cher is -- forgive me -- sensational as Loretta Castorini, a widow who wants to be married and does not have to be in love with the groom. Aielo (Johny Cammareri) obliges by proposing, offering her his pinkie ring as a substitute for an engagement ring, then rushes off to Sicily to be with his dying mother. He charges Loretta with seeing to that his estranged brother, Ronny, attends the wedding. Loretta confronts Ronny and quickly falls in love with him. Meanwhile, her father (Vincent Gardenia) is cheating on her mother (Olympia Dukakis), which Loretta accidentally discovers when Ronny invites her to the Metropolitan Opera.Everything works out in the end, as it inevitably does in films of this genre. In the meantime, all the actors acquit themselves admirably and the audience enjoys itself. In its way, ""Moonstruck"" is how Hollywood used to be at its best: rollicking entertainment with no social significance whatsoever. If they'd only lost ""That's Amore"" along the way, it would have been perfect.",Moonstruck

47,barryrd,Cher and Cage romantic comedy,8,2 February 2016,"Moonstruck is good entertainment that fits the bill as a movie for various ages and tastes. The sexual indiscretions are treated with humour. The Italian neighbourhood in New York where the movie is set is more like an urban village. One amusing scene shows Loretta played by Cher, as a 37 year-old widow and daughter of an Italian family, as she makes her confession to the parish priest, who speaks to her on a first name basis. Then she runs into her mother, Rose, played by Olympia Dukakis, praying in church. This typifies the close society of her neighbourhood where the restaurants, churches, delis and corner groceries are meeting places for neighbours and family. The locale is New York City near the Metropolitan Opera, which enters the story when Loretta and her new boyfriend, played by Nicholas Cage, go on a date. Coincidentally, they happen to spot her father, Cosmo, played by Vince Gardenia, with a girlfriend. Loretta has become engaged to Johnny, performed by Danny Aiello, who she fears will find out about her new boyfriend after his return from Italy. The new boyfriend also happens to be the brother of her fiancé. Things seem to unravel and then be resolved for the family, friends and neighbours under the influence of a full moon. Nicholas Cage and Cher seem to be made for each other in this movie as the still young widow and the hard-luck, angry butcher. It is in fact a group of people who have all seen their share of tragedy, success, and strained family relationships. Good luck and good sense does not always win the day. Yet, the movie is full of heart and is something of a lesson on how to put egos aside and let our best instincts work things out. Norman Jewison directed this delightful movie. Recommend.",Moonstruck
48,Geeky Randy,Geeky Randy's summary,7,31 March 2014,"Classic romantic comedy about 37-year-old widow (played terrifically by Cher) getting engaged to mismatched Aiello, only to begin falling for his younger brother, a bitter and heartbroken one-handed baker (played by Nicolas Cage in one of his better performances). Really captures the complexity of love by incorporating Gardenia and Dukakis' sub-plot(s), who play Loretta's (Cher) parents. Well-loved for a reason; but fans overlook the all-too-familiar movie flaw of having deep characters and a complex plot wrapped up nicely with a simple solution. The mood alone captures a wonderful cinema-style that was lost once the 1980s were over. For better or for worse, there will probably never be anything else quite like it.*** (out of four)",Moonstruck
49,Christian_Dimartino,It should have won Best Picture.,10,28 June 2013,"I always love it when a comedy gets nominated for Oscars, because it really shows the world that the academy has a sense of humor. There have been plenty of very good and worthy comedies nominated for Oscars. As Good As It Gets, Little Miss Sunshine, Juno, A Serious Man. But there is no question that one of the best ones has to be Norman Jewison's Moonstruck. It is easily one of the most delightfully funny (and it's hilarious by the way), charming, clever, and entertaining films ever. And it has a 7 on IMDb. Outrageous.Moonstruck tells the story of Loretta (Cher in her Oscar-winning role), a widowed Italian woman who has just gotten engaged to Johnny (Danny Aiello). Johnny says that he won't marry her until his mother is dead (she is dying very soon). So when he goes to visit his mother, he asks Loretta for a favor: Invite his estranged brother Ronny (Nicolas Cage), who had a falling out with him some years ago, to the wedding. But once Loretta and Ronnie meet, something unexpected happens. They fall in love.I'm thinking it, so I am going to say it. Moonstruck should have won Best Picture. I don't know what The Last Emperor is, and if I don't know what it is, then it probably didn't matter. Moonstruck is not just a great movie, but it's also great for a romantic comedy. I love a comedy that feels real even though there is nothing to take seriously. Moonstruck is just that movie.Cher and Olympia Dukakis are wonderful. I don't know if I can quite say that Cher deserved Best Actress (she beat Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction), but she is terrific. Loretta is quite a character, and that character may not have came alive as well without Cher's charisma. Olympia Dukakis, who plays her mother, is terrific mainly due to her sarcasm. Also, believe it or not, a ""good Nicolas Cage"" used to exist, and that is him in this movie.I love Moonstruck. It is easily the best movie of 1987, and it should have won the award. But I'm glad that it won Best Screenplay, Supporting Actress, and Actress. Easily one of the greatest romantic comedies of them all. IMDb needs to boost up their ratings a little bit. Put Magnolia, Boogie Nights, Tootsie, Titanic, and Moonstruck on the Top 250 today! A+",Moonstruck

Problem is Nicholas Cage, there is no chemistry between he and Cher and they are the central love story. Cher almost makes up for this with her reactions to Cage's shifting accent and out of control body language. Cage simply never settles into his role. He tries everything he can think of and comes across as an actor rather than real person and that's what's needed in a love story. Cage has had these same kind of performance problems in other roles that require more of a Jimmy Stewart type character. Cage keeps taking these roles, perhaps because he likes those kind of movies but his own energy as an actor doesn't lend itself to them, though he's gotten better at it with repeated attempts. He should leave these type of roles to less interesting actors who would fully commit to the film and spend his energy and considerable talent in more off beat roles and films where he can be his crazy interesting self.",Moonstruck

61,hasosch,The Martyrdom of the Italian Language,10,26 July 2009,"To make it clear at the beginning: ""Moonstruck"" is one of my favorite movies. It is almost perfect, the right actors play the right roles, the story touches the heart of every (Italian) immigrant, Dean Martin's song comes always at the right moments, and the director from whom we unfortunately have movies like ""The Fiddler on the roof"" and ""Jesus Christ Superstar"", did for once in his life a masterpiece.The Italian language plays a very important role in this movie, since the story plays exclusively amongst Italian immigrants and their descendants in a kind of ""Little Italy"" in New York. The bakery, the grocery, the flower shop, even the funeral parlor are Italian. And everybody seems still to speak Italian, although it is astonishing that in ""Moonstruck"", one hardly hears one complete Italian sentence. However --- what Italian do we hear? Feodor Chaliapin, who plays the grandpa, is for the director (interview in the specials) a ""famous Italian actor who worked with Fellini"". In reality, Chaliapin was a Russian who spoke almost as bad Italian as he spoke English, and he had an uncredited extra-role in ""Roma"" and not one main film role in his life. Everybody who understands Italian recognizes that he addresses his dogs in the singular formal way instead of using the informal plural which he uses only when he says ""guardate la bella luna"". Chaliapin even addresses Vincent Gardenia, although this one plays his son, in the formal way. The few Italian words he uses when he talks to his alleged Italian emigrant-friends in the scene on the cemetery, are completely mistaken. The waiter in the restaurant ""Il Ticino"" (whose name is interestingly Swiss and not Italian), the very much underrated great Robert Weil, serves a ""minestroni"" instead of a minestrone. Even for Dean Martin who supposedly grew up Italian speaking, ""candela"" (candle) rhymes first with ""bella"" and second with ""fellow (fella)"". Martin seems to switch freely between ""amore"" and ""amori"". One more word about the name of Loretta's family. I have full understanding for people who change their name after they arrive in the U.S., because they are suffering from the constant mispronunciation. However, the Italian name for the server is ""cameriere"". Besides that, there is a family name ""Cammariere"", but no such name as ""Cammareri"", pronounced approximately as ""ka-ma-re-rey"". Since this name can be heard at least twenty times in the movie, it hurts one's ears. Similar is the case of ""Cappomaggi"" which is correctly ""Capomaggio"". The only one whose one Italian sentence is fully correct is Vincent Gardenia's ""Anch'io ti amo"". He was born - as it sung by Dean Martin - ""back in old Napoli"".",Moonstruck

According to a legend the light of the full moon brings people together and it certainly does in Brooklyn on a moonlit night. The chemistry between Cher and the brother of her late husband's best friend who is her current fiancé, played by Nicolas Cage, is extraordinary.

I liked it, but I think it may be a tad overrated at times. For me, this was the type of film that could have been a masterpiece, in which some scenes were done so superbly that I just loved them. Other scenes needed some work, however, and some of them left me a little bored and waiting for better. The first 30 minutes or so was spectacular, and I couldn't help laughing at so many things, such as Cher coming home announcing her engagement and her family's response being ""Again?"", though she was only married once. After Cher goes to meet Nicolas Cage, the film slows down and there seem to be less laughs for a while. The ending scene, however, is perfectly done and makes the whole film worth watching, as it is filled with laughs and happy endings. Cher and Olympia Dukakis both deserved their Oscars for this film, and the Oscar-winning screenplay also works well. My main issue is the morals of this film, such as Cher sleeping with Cage on the first night they meet and the father having an affair. Without those issues, we would have a near perfect film on our hands. This is a good romantic comedy, but could have still been improved on.*** out of ****",Moonstruck
67,lora64,Real love finds a way,10,1 September 2001,"I've seen this movie many times and still enjoy watching it. The music at start, ""That's Amore"" sung by Dean Martin really sets a lighthearted mood as we're introduced to people's lives and loves. Later on the beautiful addition of music from Puccini's ""La Boheme"" stirs more depth of feeling in Loretta (Cher) and Ronny (Nicolas Cage) but not without some rocky hurdles still ahead to get through.I particularly liked to see the episodes of the Old Man (Feodor Chaliapin Jr.) and his troop of canine companions happily out for a stroll, or encouraging them to howl at the moon, or his feeding them on the sly at home which raises the wrath of Rose (Olympia Dukakis). One of his best lines, ""I'm confused"" uttered at the end seems to top it all off since this movie has plenty of confusion to spread around.Loretta's father, Cosmo (Vincent Gardenia) is a typical example of an older man's philandering for reasons of his own but Rose, his wife, thinks it's because he's fearful of facing old age and death, so she tells him in so many words that ""whatever you do you're gonna die."" Cold comfort indeed but it makes him realize just what he's reaching out for.This is a fine group performance by an excellent cast showing that family life isn't all sweetness and light, yet despite the clashes somehow things work out for the best and harmony is established  somewhere down the line.

75,TedMichaelMor,La bella luna! The moon brings the woman to the man. Capice?,9,26 July 2010,"From the director of the awful film ""The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming"" and the overwrought but empty ""In the Heat of the Night"", comes a film with immense promise, much of it realised. Another hackneyed performance by Nicholas Cage undoes the work of an otherwise superb cast. I deeply admire Norman Jewison. I believe he intends to make serious films. He has great skill as a storyteller. He addresses important social and political themes. There are moments in this film that utterly delight this viewer. Cinematography by David Watkin, one my favourite cinematographers and a very much unappreciated one, brings immense joy to watching this movie. I don't know if he or Mr. Jewison is responsible for the close up of eggs in the middle. I love that shot. I also very much love the score by composer Dick Hyman. It is a perfect work for this film. No one does better film scores than Mr. Hyman, whose remarkable work with Woody Allen became an important part of my love of many classic Allen films. The script by John Patrick Shanly, the writer of ""Joe Versus the Volcano, a much neglected and undervalued film, seems (to me) to personify a love of New York and Italian New York culture and society. This is beautiful writing. If editor Lou Lombardo had somehow been able to edit Nicholas Cage from this work, the film would rate close to a ten. The rest of the cast does outstanding work. For a look at what Mr. Jewison did achieve look at ""Fiddler on the Roof"", ""A Soldier's Story"", or ""The Hurricane"". At any rate, this is a fine work to enjoy in spite of that fundamental flaw in casting. If you fail to love Cher after watching the movie, you need to get a life! Capice?,",Moonstruck
76,Chuck-149,"A perfect mix of love and comedy by one of the masters, Norman Jewison.",8,31 August 1999,"When I saw ""Moonstruck"", it was the first movie I saw with Cher and now I think she's absolutely delightful.  However, she is well supported by strong performances by Nicolas Cage, Vincent Gardenia, and Olypia Dukakis (in her best supporting-actress winning role) and of course, great directing by Norman Jewison.  Even though  Cher is made to look like a woman who is forty years old and doesn't wear any make-up or has her hair done every week, it is impossible to make her look not very pretty.  However, it's kind of hard to tell the story without spoiling any promises so I will just say this: Go see it.",Moonstruck
77,Supachewy,One of the Best Romantic Comedies Ever,7,14 September 2010,"The romantic comedy Moonstruck is directed by Norman Jewison and stars Cher and Nicolas Cage. The film takes place in modern day Brooklyn.The film starts off with Loretta Castoroni (Cher) in a restaurant with Johnny Cammareri (Aiello). Johnny proposes to Loretta and after a bunch of little jokes she agrees to it. Loretta was married once before but her husband was killed by a bus. She claims that she had bad luck because they did not have a proper marriage and she wants it to be so that this time everything goes just right. Loretta lives with her mother and father, as well as her grandfather. She also sees her aunt and uncle very often because they as well live in Brooklyn. Johnny goes to Sicily to be with her on her deathbed and gives Loretta the task of contacting his brother, Ronny (Cage), and inviting him to the wedding. The two brothers have not spoken to each other for five years so Loretta has to patch up their relationship. Well when she goes to see him she doesn't do anything to help patch that relationship up...The screenplay for this film was very good from John Patrick Shanley and he won an Oscar for it. Loretta was a very real character which is always great because an audience can't relate to a main character that seems fake. He did a great job of creating a family vibe and getting a lot of very smart and funny dialogue in the script. Ronny Cammareri was an over the top character yet in a way he added much to the plot because Loretta was so real and down to Earth. Overall a very well written script and a classic romantic comedy.The direction of the film was fine as well. Jewison had many memorable shots throughout the film, such as when Loretta went to confession how only the priest's hands were shown of his and nothing else. Also, I liked how the framing of the shot of Loretta and Ronny looking at the moon, it just had a classic feel to it. Jewison did an excellent job working with his actors since two of them received Oscars the one was nominated. He as well deserved the Oscar nomination that he received.The acting in the film was also very good. Cher gave an excellent performance as Loretta and it is very memorable. She is definitely one of the most talented entertainers out there to be such a great singer and a great actress. What was great about her performance I thought was her eye movement. It was just brilliant the way she looked at the other actors. Nicolas Cage was a little over the top but he needed to be because his character was. His performance does not really show any range, but his career is still young and as it grows he proves that he is as well a great actor. Vincent Gardenia and Olympia Dukakis gave marvelous performances as well as Loretta's mother and father. Gardenia was a very over the top kind of man that was kind of a stock character of a Brooklyn father but he did a fine job as the role. Dukakis was basically an older version of Loretta and played the part as well as Cher. A finely acted film.Overall I give this film a very strong 7/10 because romantic comedies aren't really my favorite genre, but this is one of the best ones out there. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of romantic comedies.",Moonstruck
78,Koceny,5 dogs,5,1 August 2021,"The best part of this movie are 5 dogs, owned by one of the main characters. That's why I gave it 5 points.This is a comedy, withouth the funny part.

It's too simple and predictable.The owerall verdict: you are not missing much if not seeing this one.",Moonstruck

Wonderful performances from Cher and Nicolas Cage (as always) gently row the plot along. There are no rapids to cross, no dangerous waters, just a warm and witty paddle through New York life at its best.

I remember thinking how good she was on her TV shows and ""Moonstruck"" only proves it to me.  Nicholas Cage is delightful as his heart softens to Loretta, and Olympia Dukakis is a gem.  The entire cast shines, even Danny Aiello in his smallish part!  My favorite part is where everybody is noticing the moon outside their windows; I weep with pure joy over the beauty and timing every time I see it.

Last year, I reluctantly rented it with some friends, and fell in love with this movie.  It's romantic without being cornball, the dialogue is priceless (check out the ""quotes"") and the performances are pitch-perfect.

For me it is a happy feel good movie, a go-to movie, and at times throughout life, the DVD left perpetually in the slot! I will admit being an Italian American living in downstate NY definitely helps with its allure and charm. So many traditions, dialog and yes funny stereo types are spot on. So many classic quotes still repeated in usual conversation to this day. Snap out of it! Grab an expresso and watch without much thought. Just enjoy the ride.

87,carolinephillips-47427,It Must Be Him,7,23 April 2020,"Moonstruck is one of those movies everyone thinks they've seen, because it's infamous ""snap out of it"" moment has been so ingrained in pop culture. I thought I had seen it just from the clips that would catch my attention on TV over the years, but I suddenly remembered that I'd never sat down and watched the whole thing from the beginning.Loretta (Cher) is a somewhat bored and lifeless New York accountant whose just agreed to marry her less than ideal fiance, Johnny (Danny Aiello). When he goes off to see his dying mother in Italy, he makes her promise that she'll call up his estranged brother, Ronny (Nicholas Cage) and invite him to the wedding. Soon, Loretta finds herself in an unexpected love affair with Ronny and she begins changing, becoming more and more free, sexy, and full of life.Moonstruck is, on the surface, your average chick flick/rom com, but it boats an excellent performance by Cher and the rest of the cast is equally impressive including Olympia Dukakis as her mother who's having her own set of issues. If there's one thing that pokes out like a sore thumb, it's Nicholas Cage. His New York accent wavers throughout and he feels more like a cartoon than a real person.Moonstruck is a must watch for anyone craving a bit of light comfort food. It had me smiling from start to finish.",Moonstruck

It is a multi-layered story with some terrific vignettes and the script, cast and performances are all first rate. Cher, Olympia Dukakis (both Oscar winners), Vincent Gardenia and Danny Aiello have rarely, if ever, been better and the tuneful and romantic score is an added treat. This is a must-see and another gem from the great director Jewison.",Moonstruck
89,Polonius85,One of the most quoted movies in my house; Masterpiece,10,24 May 2012,"Every big full moon my family sees gets dubbed ""Cosmo's moon."" When I worked in sales, I would stick in a Moonstruck reference when trying to convince someone to buy the step up, saying ""This is pretty good, unless something goes wrong. And something ALWAYS goes wrong."" When cooking in our house, the request for someone to hand the cook the butcher knife is always, ""CHRISSY, BRING ME THE BIG KNIFE!"" (and there's no one named Chrissy in my family). If anyone says the word ""temporary"" someone will inevitably say, ""EVERYTHING IS TEMPORARY!"" Yes, we've seen Moonstruck a lot! Awesome movie. Great acting, great cast, likable characters...and it's not even a movie that needed to have a twisted storyline or absolute angst. It's one of those rare movies that really doesn't have much in the way of weaknesses. It's a simple slice of life film about two Italian families in Brooklyn. Simple as that. With the lovably passionate, eccentric personalities that come from such a culture as New York Italian, there's little need to insert ""jokes"" into this movie. The reality of the almost poetic communication among the family members is funny (at times hilarious!) enough. Plus, anyone who is passionate about Italian food like I am gets the urge the take a day trip to Little Italy to pick up a good loaf of bread every time they see the bread Ronny takes out of his bakery's old coal-fired brick oven! Every character is believable and likable, flaws and all. Loretta is a superstitious, but smart and level-headed widow who, in a rare loss of self-control, makes a passionate decision that causes a riotous chain of events within her family. Cosmo, Loretta's father, is a successful plumber who, now in his mid to late 60s, has begun to feel he has done nothing with his life and fears death. He turns to extramarital affairs in order to fill gaps he feels are in his life. Rose, the cynical, dry-witted wife of Cosmo and mother of Loretta, remains supportive and loving of her husband and daughter despite their moral failings. There's Johnny, Loretta's soft-spoken fiancé, is still controlled emotionally by his mother, who lives in Sicily. Ronny, Johnny's estranged brother, is an impulsive and tortured man who developed a vendetta against happiness ever since he lost his hand in a bread slicer (causing his then-fiancé, who did not want to be with a crippled man, to leave him). That is, until he meets Loretta. There's Raymond, Rose's brother, and his wife, Rita, who are still madly in love even after being married for many, many years. And there's the Old Man, Cosmo's immigrant father who spends most of his time sneaking table food to his many dogs (much to Rose's dismay), scolding them in Italian, and grunting his displeasure and exasperation with his family's chaos and morally questionable activities. Despite being frail and old, he is shown to still be very wise and authoritative, condemning Cosmo for breaking the family and demanding that Cosmo pay for Loretta's wedding.All these personalities come together and make a very ordinary story interesting and funny.All in all, I offer one piece of advice: See this movie. It's unforgettable.",Moonstruck

If Scorsese had to do a romcom - this would be it. That and a good dose of Woody Allen thrown in and you'd have Moonstruck.Loved that mid 80s grubby New York feel too.

Cher is absolutely dazzling in this role and Nicholas Cage delivers one of the best performances of his career. I love that the characters are the focus in this film and every actor portrays their character convincingly. Cher and Gage have amazing chemistry on screen and its hard not to fall for their relationship. The humour is pretty strong and I always find myself laughing throughout the film. Director Norman Jawison does a great job at making the film engaging and charming and Moonstruck is easily his best piece of work.

Cher conveys a really natural acting performance which deserves all the accolades and acclaim. I don't know whether it is because I am studying to become an opera singer or not but the movie's inclusion of opera adds depth to the movie in my opinion. The scene at the Met, the showcase of the iconic chandeliers, the fact that Loretta and Ronny see Puccini's La Boheme, the amazing soundtrack which contains Mimi's arias sung by the incredible Renata Tebaldi... Oh and of course the fact that they used Musetta'a waltz, Quando m'en vo, throughout the movie, both its vocal and instrumental versions... All those allusions to the operatic literature add so much background to the movie like stated before, thus listening, watching and learning about the opera, La Boheme in particular, would be insightful before seeing the movie.

100,edwinalarren,"I Understand!! Then Again, So Does Everybody Else!!",10,8 March 2010,"The bittersweet twist to this movie contains a wonderful element of romanticism that evokes an impetuous passion! These characteristics of idealistic imagery which ""Moonstruck"" possesses, spur on an end result of a resounding thumbs up verdict by virtually every prominent critic in Hollywood. Let me describe the circumstances to this film, simply put, they are ""yesteryear"". ""Moonstruck"" is a cohesive film which sparks the naivety of an old Italian neighborhood in New York City. New York City has always been one big melting pot that is galvanized by many bicker-some mannerisms which are indicative of typical New Yorkers, this includes a lot of Italian Americans living in New York as well! The mid and late eighties brought on an abrupt conclusion to many strong associations with various cultural stereotypes. Ethnicity polarization was a firmly embedded scourge in American history that was far more prevalent several generations before this movie was made. These generalizing proclivities still exist today, however, they are more mollified and less identifiable! For this Italian family of a bygone era, confusion, indecisiveness, agitation, and yes, of course, love, all have the comical camaraderie of an utterly human understanding to them! The kindred spirits with everyone in ""Moonstruck"" seems to be that of comprehending individual frailties. One might wonder about Cher playing the lead role, as she is more known as an entertainer than a big box office first billing star in a movie. In ""Moonstruck"", however, I think she was incredibly well suited to her role, and came off as thoroughly believable in a relatively unbelievable situation. All of the characters in ""Moonstruck"" are very rough around the edges, really tough, and not afraid to have a formidable duel with adversity. The most hilarious aspect to their lives is imperfection, and they are thoroughly aware of the fact that weathering the storm definitely serves a constructive purpose! I thought the acting in this movie was sensational. All relationships in this movie garner an auspicious potential to vividly illuminate because everybody knows how everybody else's basic nature is really like!! For this family, nothing is glamorous, nothing is pretentiously romantic, and nothing is overly emotional (just moderately so). The fact is, this entire family is plainly and perpetually afflicted and overcome by an extremely zealous and candid cupid in all of their lives. Taking moon beams literally can indeed have a pleasantly enervating impact on one's resolve, masqueraded mystique, and resistance to the proverbial am ore'. Thus signifying everything!! The homey and mercurial tenet in this film is basically one of ; Be honest, get angry; Be honest, get confrontational; Be honest, get distorted and emphatic; Most importantly; Be honest, and fall in love!! This is Cher's best performance ever as an actress!! Nicholas Cage, Danny Aiello, and Olympia Dukakis, were wonderfully flawed in ""Moonstruck"" Such performances by these three were perfectly appropriate for the kinetic energy of the characters in this movie! Director, Norman Jewison (Famous for ""Cincinnati Kid"", ""Thomas Crowne Affair"", and most famous for ""In The Heat Of The Night"" which won the academy award for best picture in 1967) depicts many keen and humanistic instincts in the process of purveying the deliberate incongruity to this film! I am Italian American in descent, (Partially anyways) Cher is not Italian, and, for that matter, neither is the writer nor the director! I guess since non-Italians like eating our food, they may as well use our culture to make a fabulous film too! It is refreshing to know that a film can be marvelous and have an incredibly happy ending!! For those of you who didn't like this movie, I just have one thing to say ""Snap Out Of It!!"" This movie ""Moonstruck"" is totally happy go lucky!! Totally eighties!! and Totally five stars!! See it!!",Moonstruck

It is so filled with poetry and smart humor that the only possible weakness could be that it's too good! I mean, it's so funny and touching throughout that I worry I'm being manipulated by a master of narrative so powerful that I'm overwhelmed. When every scene seems classic then surely it's a cliché, no? Well, anyway, that's my irrational worry. The only lapse in its logic and flow that I can see is that Johnny says he can't get married now because his mother will die. But, wait a minute, didn't she get better because he was getting married? Riddle me this, my friends. That's always bothered me. On the other hand, you can take Nick Cage's speech outside of his apartment and set it to verse and it's a work of passionate art! ""We are meant to love the wrong people, etc., etc. "" Wham! Beautiful! The ending is my fave, the reconciliation, the links to history & family. Beautiful!

I have only recently learned how to do these postings. Moonstruck shows Italians as people and not cartoon gangsters. The most famous portrayer of gangsters in the 1930's was Edward G. Robinson; who was so far from Italian it's funny. Then the stories were reduced in importance due to WW2, with the Italian mob making a comeback with Mario Puzo's books and Francis Coppola's movies. It is great to simply see a family with an ordinary business living through ordinary issues, and no ""Goodfellas"" anywhere in sight. Yes, I know Cher is Armenian; but all those years married to Salvatore Bono must have left an impression about Italian-American families. Olympia Dukakis; ethnically Greek, however those of us who grew up in Chicago lived in neighborhoods where Greeks and Italians lived side by side and the only differences were the choices of meats and wine.

She's taken in by the first, but doesn't really seem to have a whole lot of interest in the second, so I'm not even sure where they're supposed to have any common ground.Ronny doesn't even treat Loretta well. Not long after they meet, and he goes through his little drama queen moping routine, and she basically tells him that he's making excuses, he carries her off to his bedroom. She sounds less than enthusiastic about the prospect, but he ignores that. Then, the next night, he shouts at her to go to his bedroom again.

This movie feels like a slice of warm apple pie topped with french vanilla ice cream! I think this is Cher's best work ever and her most believable performance. Cher has always been blessed with charisma, good looks, and an enviably thin figure. Whether you like her singing or not - who else sounds like Cher? Cher has definitely made her mark in the entertainment industry and will be remembered long after others have come and gone. She is one of the most unique artists out there. It's funny, because who would have thought of Cher as such a naturally gifted actress? She is heads above the so-called movie ""stars"" of today. Cher is a real actor on the same level as Debra Winger, Alfre Woodard, Holly Hunter, Angela Bassett and a few others, in that she never seems to be ""acting,"" she really becomes the character convincingly. She has more than earned the respect of her peers and of the movie-going public.Everything about Moonstruck is wonderful - the characters, the scenery, the dialog, the food. I never get tired of watching this movie.Every time single time I watch the scene where they are all sitting around the dinner table at Rose's house, I pause the remote to see exactly what delicious food Rose is serving. I saw the spaghetti, mushrooms (I think), but I can't make out whether they are eating ravioli, ziti? What is that main course? It looks wonderful and its driving me nuts! Everybody in that family was a hardworking individual and they respected and cared about one another. The grandfather wasn't pushed aside and tolerated, he was a vital part of the family and he was listened to and respected for his age and wisdom. He seemed to be a pretty healthy, independent old codger too.Loretta's mom wasn't ""just a housewife,"" she was the glue that held the family together and was a model example of what a wife, mother, and home manager should aspire to be. She was proud of the lifestyle she had chosen but she didn't let it define who she was. High powered businessmen aren't as comfortable in their skin as Rose Casterini was. Notice the saucy way she said ""I didn't have kids until after I was 37. It ain't over 'til its over."" You got the sense that she had been the type of young woman who did exactly as she pleased and got her way without the other person realizing what had happened. She was charming, quick witted, and very smart. What a great mom! I didn't actually like Loretta right away because she seemed like a bit of a know--it-all who wasn't really as adventurous and as in control of herself as she wanted others to think. She could tell others about themselves and where they had gone wrong, but she really didn't apply common sense to her own life. She was going to marry a middle-aged mama's boy simply because she wanted a husband and a sense of identity and purpose to her life. She was more conventional than her own mom. She dressed and wore her hair like a matron at a house of detention and seemed humorless and bored, but underneath you sensed that she was vulnerable and lonely and had a lot of love to give the right man. She would probably end up making an awesome mom too.I could see in the future, a house full of Loretta and Ronnie's loud, screaming happy kids and Rose and Cosmo enjoying every minute of it.",Moonstruck

Cher's performance is still effective but you can see where it's a tad thin. Nicolas Cage is almost unrecognizable. He's sooo young and (dare I say it?) hot! He certainly brought loads of passion to his role but at some point, I became distracted by his hair. All the supporting performances are still strong. This movieis certainly an ancestor to other ethnic family tales like ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"". I think John Patrick Shaney should tweak it for the stage.

It's the story of a young widow who was ready to settle for a dull second husband, and a bitter, injured younger brother (of her fiance) who hates the world and was ready to give up on it.

When it came on again this week, I meant to record it for future viewing and ended up watching it AGAIN in its entirety. There is something warm, world weary, unflaggingly hopeful, and family affirming about this film that just makes me feel great every time I see it. Cher and Nicholas Cage are absolutely perfect in these roles. Olympia Dukakis is so wonderful her performance should be shown in acting classes regularly. Director Jewison so artfully directed this film it's like a symphony. Every nuance hits the right note; even the character actors are splendidly good in their roles. Best of all is the script which so tragicomically captures the ups and down of Italian family life, and above the commitment to love in a very brave way. A great movie for young and old.

It is virtually flawless! The writing, acting, production design, humor and pathos are all wonderful! Even the music -- from Dean Martin to La Boheme -- is captivating and delightful!Every character is peculiarly delightful and memorable, from the leads played by Cher and Nicolas Cage, to the many supporting roles -- Olympia Dukakis , Vincent Gardenia, John Mahoney, Danny Aiello -- even grandpa with his dog pack! Each of these performers, plus Norman Jewison as Director, performs above their normal quality in this ensemble work. For several of the actors, this was an early major exposure in film, so the casting is also exceptional -- and we have many current acting powerhouses whose careers were altered by their effectiveness in this film.I've seen this film several times all the way through -- which can sometimes deflate the impact of a film substantially. More tellingly, I realized some years ago that whenever I channel-surfed my way into a scene from this film -- any scene -- the scene was compelling and beautifully crafted. There are so many stunning and memorable scenes the original meeting between the Cher and Nicolas Cage characters, where Cage tells his tale of woe; Vincent Gardenia discovered with his paramour at the opera, amidst the splendor generated by his gold-mine plumbing business; Olympia Dukakis scolding John Mahoney for philandering with his student in the classic line about liaisons with co-workers: ""Don't sh-t where you eat!""; Danny Aiello at his dying mother's bedside; Nicolas Cage ""taking"" Cher as the rapture of an aria soars in the background!

The fact that Cher is so perfect in the film and is more unlike ""Cher"" than she has ever been is a wonder to me.

The only thing is he asks her to invite his brother to the wedding; the brother he hasn't spoken to in years because of ""Bad Blood"" When she goes to see him, she is instantly attracted to him, and it goes on from there.I must admit that although I'm not crazy about Cher's music, she is definitely one of America's most underrated actors.  She so deserved her Oscar for Moonstruck.  This is one of my favorite movies and I watch it at least 2 or 3 times a year.  Olympia Dukakis was hilarious as Cher's mother, and her line about kicking the old man til he's dead makes me laugh no matter how many times I see that scene.

On my list of favorite movies, Moonstruck is number 3. It's a ""feel good"" movie where you leave the theatre humming ""that's amore"" or repeating some of your favorite lines: ""old man, if you give those dogs another piece of my food, I'll kick you till you're dead""; ""Chrissy, bring me the big knife"", ""who's dead"", ""do you love him Loretta....., good because when you do, they drive you crazy because they know they can"".

130,johndoc1,A perfect 'little' movie,10,18 July 2004,"I was surprised to see the lead review on this movie, which dinged it for being 'not really up to much in the grand scheme of things'. That misses the point. This is not 'Citizen Kane'; it's not 'The Godfather'. It doesn't try to be. It is a little story, perfectly rendered. The family vignettes are near perfect. In particular, look for the scene when Loretta's employers show up and try to figure out what she did with the day's receipts. The previous reviewer did not remember if the movie won any awards and didn't find any characters, but Cher & Vincent Gardenia compelling. 3 Oscars: Cher for best actress, Olympia Dukakis for best supporting and Shanley for the screenplay. Danny Aiello is a perfect buffoon, Gardenia, always great, deserved a Oscar as well but lost to Sean Connery's effective turn in 'The Untouchables'. Look for John Mahoney (Frazier's Dad from TV) in a smarmy cameo. From Dino's ""That's Amore"" at the start, thru the wonderful use of 'La Boheme' to the closing, the music complements this film in a big way. ""The Moo"" is right.

Cher gives one of her best performances as the superstitious widow who would rather marry for companionship then allow herself to be hurt again.

In case anyone doesn't know what this movie is about.....Loretta, Cher, has ""no luck or bad luck."" She is desperately marrying a man who is OK with her but she is definitely not head over heels in love with him. She is getting into her 30's with graying hair.

Although I'm no Cher fan, she gives an excellent performance and her part was well written.  The cinematography was well done and captures a sense of romance.The Rest: a thin plotline, Nicholas Cage's performance, and a totally unhumorous and weak attempt to portray an Italian-American family from New York.  Firstly, everytime time Cage opened his mouth I cringed.  I don't know what kind of accent he was trying use.  I honestly don't, it sure wasnt any New York or Italian accent I've ever heard.  It was quite surreal. And it wasn't because I'm some stickler for accuracy, his voice just cloyed in my ears.  And I like Nicholas Cage in other performances.  Secondly, and this is purely anecdotal, but I have many Italian relations, friends and acquaintances in New York City, and frankly I've gotten more laughs and felt more joy in the appreciation of the Italian ethnic family by far than this movie provided.

Their dialogue about why he is at odds with his brother were classic and hilarious all at once.The characters plays nicely off each other and the whole family is typical of Italian-American - from the style of cooking to their mannerisms. Olympia Dukakis' Rose was phenomenal and her portrayal as the intuitive wife to Vincent Gardenia's Cosmo was wonderful; she completely stole the show! Cher slipped surprisingly easily into the role of Loretta like a glove and although at times her Italian accent seemed a little ""too Italian"" she was impressive.

Nick Cage plays an over-the-top, brooding romantic to Danny Aiello's safe, stodgy, stingy older brother. Dukakis is brilliant as the sad and wise mother and I can't stand Vincent Gardenia but even his role is irreplaceable. The movie is beautifully filmed and so full of fun it overflows. Each scene is perfect. The characters intertwine and if you don't like the love scene between the Cappomaggis you aren't human. Another poster asked what the purpose of the lost deposit bag is. It's the reason the Cappomaggis come to the house early in the morning. It's a foil to get all the family in one place. I have no idea what Italians in NY are like. Frankly, I have no idea what NY is like. But this film makes me smell the streets and the bread shop and the old home. All the characters move comfortably in the environment and they all come together at just the right time. It's about la luna, l'amore, and la famiglia.

The cast got just the right take on the excellent script, and in addition, Dick Hyman's musical settings of the opera and the other music made for a perfect match. Hard to imagine how they kept the precise mood going throughout the long production of a film. The comedy is subtle (mostly), and the camera-work mirrors every little emotional inflection of the narrative. Cher is such a comedy natural, Vincent Gardenia (who I know mostly through his Frank Lorenzo role on All in the Family until I saw him in this and then off-Broadway in the 80's)deserved far greater stardom than he ever got, and Aiello's hapless loser are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to giving kudos to this tremendous cast.

The kitchen scene when Loretta is feeding Ronnie, the "" not so well done""steak, so it can feed his blood, is hilarious. Those words would have come out of any of my female relatives.Ronnie's white kitchen with the white fixtures and white tile is a copycat of my aunt Elvira's spotless kitchen.When Mrs. Casterini is fixing the breakfast of fried eggs in the Italian bread blankets for Loretta and herself, I was in my grandmother's kitchen.I get such comfort when the movie scenes are in the Casterini kitchen, dining room and parlor.

Check it out on YouTube, search on Moonsock. I think this movie is amazing for several reasons: 1. John Patrick Shanley has perfect pitch when it comes to the logic of the Italian-American dialog (an oxymoron). The scene with Cosmo and Johnny (""I'll say no more"") is a perfect example. As my Italian grandmother used to say, ""6 of one, 7 of the other,"" or ""If your father were alive, he'd be rolling in his grave."" 2. The dialog is so universal to the range of human emotions, that in any given conversation, you could respond with a line from the movie. For example, someone asks, ""How's your mother?"" you could respond, ""She's dead, but I could still hear her big mouth."" Try it for a day, you'll see. 3.

While Johnny is away in Italy, Loretta meets Johnny's brother (Nicolas Cage) and accidently falls in love with him.

Everyone in this film gave a superb performance that brought life to these wonderful characters that made this film one that you can watch repeatedly and not get tired of it.",Moonstruck
147,phtdesign,#1 desert island choice,10,3 October 2014,"if i had to pick 2 films that i could only see for the rest of my life, this would be number one. number two would be All About Eve. i watch Moonstruck every time i run across it on TV. the writing is AMAZING, so many zingers AND memorable heartfelt real moments and the characters are so well written. the casting is perfect down to every last role - especially olympia dukakis and the great julie bovasso, who is such a wonderful new york character actress (i.e. john travolta's mother in Saturday night fever). sadly she is no longer with us. trivia note: she was known as an excellent voice coach for people who have to do NY accents.everything i've said above (save for the actors of course) can be applied to All ABout Eve!",Moonstruck
148,sweetbee_16,Not my basket...,3,17 April 2006,"I watched this movie for a project on love. please tell Nicolas Cage to learn what it would feel like to be his character, and then re-read the lines he's saying. My life cannot go on... i accidentally cut off my own hand...my brother was close by. Obviously his fault. And since when have happy endings included the nice guy who takes care of Mom sad and alone. No closure, bad script, and doesn't have enough extension of minor characters. Save yourself, unless your up for a good laugh. Costumes were done appropriately, and extras did a fabulous job. I'm sure it would have been a fun movie to make, but keep it more genre specific, I can't recommend this movie to anyone I know, because it is not an intellectual movie. It is not a chick flick. It is not a strict romantic. And I can't show kids because of the sex and questions to follow. All in all, just not a good flick.",Moonstruck
