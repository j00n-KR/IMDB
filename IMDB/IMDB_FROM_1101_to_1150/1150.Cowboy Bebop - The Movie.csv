0,TheLittleSongbird,Compliments the show brilliantly,10,13 January 2013,"The show is one of the finest examples of anime there is, so when I heard that there was a movie I thought to myself that this could go either way. Thankfully Cowboy Bebop: The Movie went the way I hoped it would, which was that being a movie that complimented the show well and succeeded on its own merits, both of which Cowboy Bebop: The Movie does brilliantly. The animation is both ethereal and haunting, with the character designs and faces expressive. The music is emotionally complex and fits the mood of the film perfectly, when there's action it's rousing, when there is an emotional moment it is poignant and when there is an intensely dark moment it is haunting. The dialogue is very thought-provoking with some nice humour, true to the style of the show actually, while the story has a lot of layers and my attention never wavered. The characters are still the characters we know and love and written just as well. Of course the show had more time to develop its stories and characters, but the movie does more than credibly in both these areas. The voice work is similarly impressive. Overall, I recommend it without hesitation. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
1,SnoopyStyle,for fans,6,22 August 2018,"The crew of Bebop is on Mars. Faye Valentine witnesses a terrorist denotating a tanker truck bomb. The authority fears the spread of a bio-weapon and offers a large bounty on the suspect. Faye is eager to track him down. Jet Black and Spike Spiegel reluctantly join the hunt.This is a full length movie based on the very interesting animated show. It's always nice to have these great characters return for one more adventure. That's not to say that everything is cool. First, they changed the intro. It's unbelievable that anybody would attempt to change the theme. I can accept a longer expanded theme but they can't simply change it wholesale. It's also weird that the opening is a montage of present-day cityscape. It's odd that everybody is driving normal cars and our crew seems to be the only ones flying their spacecrafts. The revised opening is unnecessary and wrong-headed. The plot is rather simple with not that many twists and turns. All that is fine but I'm not buying that rain is the solution. It's reminiscent of Signs where water defeats the aliens. Overall, it's a nice visit for the fans but it doesn't add much to the show.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
2,Tweekums,Fun action film with some good laughs,8,17 January 2011,"I'd heard of 'Cowboy Bebop' long before I started watching anime but never got around to watching any version of it until I saw this movie. Not having seen the series I thought I might be confused as to who was who but the characters were introduced in a way that lets the first time viewer know who they are without wasting time in a way that could put off people who are familiar with the characters. The film follows a group of bounty hunters led by one Spike Spiegel who must find a disgruntled ex-soldier before he can release a deadly pathogen that could wipe out all life on Mars Yes Mars, until it was mentioned that they were in fact on Mars I'd assumed they were on Earth, in a city like New York! As they look for there man they must also evade various authorities who are determined to make sure nobody learns about the pathogen as they are responsible for its development.The film was well animated and populated by a great cast of characters. The action scenes were well executed without going over the top or being too gory and despite her rather skimpy costume Faye Valentine managed to remain decent well just about! This along with the lack of swearing means that the film is suitable for young teens. While this is predominantly an action film there are also a fair about of laughs to be had, especially when Ed is on screen.These comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
3,Quinoa1984,"as a relative newcomer, it hit the spot very well",9,9 May 2009,"Cowboy Bebop is a series I'll have to watch now from start to finish. I've caught it a few times on TV, and while never less than amazed by the animation and the vivacity and energy present in every frame with the music and action and warped characters, it's not something that can be always completely clear in terms of its chronology. According to IMDb the movie is supposed to take place between episodes 22 and 23, but the good news for those who aren't even casual fans of the series as a whole it can stand on its own feet. The movie is a triumph of super-cool action-bravura and wit, of some bits of real humor (that little girl and the dog, maybe the two most intelligent beings in this universe, are the great comic relief) coupled with bad-asses, truly vicious villain and a few people just going through the motions or covering things up. It doesn't matter, in short, to be a fan of the series - it jets you into the front seat and lets you off into this 21st century trip of Mars where the world could end tomorrow while put to some of the hippest music you could ever find.The plot might not be worth totally summarizing here (it's on the IMDb main page anyway to read yourself), but to comment on it it's not entirely something new to science fiction. A virus being released that has the particulars that Victor is about to unleash, where tiny microbes are let loose that are really microscopic machines that will destroy your insides, has been done before. The plot itself isn't the most original thing. What's fresh and inviting and engaging and nearly daring is how it treats its grungy, multi-cultural climate and the despair that hangs over everyone trying to get by, bounty hunters and doctors alike.One could argue that Victor, a man in black who could be compared to V from V For Vendetta minus the contact with the public and call for anarchy, is an emo-dude out to bring everyone down with him due to his dissatisfaction. But it never fazed me; this is a villain perfectly suited as a horrific opponent to Spike and Elektra, trying to track him down and bring him in before he can do his worst possible, and we see this in the quintessential sequence of the film where they all fight on the monorail. If for nothing else Cowboy Bebop: the Movie becomes a kind of must-see for animation and not just anime lovers. It's slick but breathtaking, like a much more superior treatment of the goofiness trying to cloak as grungy fight scenes in Wanted.It's not exactly a case of style over substance either. There's some good questions raised about the element of the outsider in a culture that should be accepting of all of them (of all places, of course, on Mars), and as any thought-provoking science fiction vehicle does it gives some food for thought. But the filmmakers are out to dazzle with movement and veracity, and this is where it shines. Save for one legitimate quibble, which is the lack of the TV show's unforgettable opening title sequence, it's a rollicking, fast-paced but touching R-rated adventure that isn't without humor. Not a Miyazaki-level masterpiece, but more like a supplemental viewing to go with Akira. It rocks.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
4,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Loved it,10,31 October 2009,"I have not watched a second of the show, so I came into this with no prior knowledge about it, and can not draw any comparisons. With that said, I had no trouble following this. I can imagine that I might have appreciated it even more if I had seen the episodes, but this is such solid and capable story-telling that I could jump right in for the two hours of this and not feel like anything went completely over my head. The atmosphere is excellently built up, and the futuristic city is a fascinating world(not to mention a stunning sight to behold). All of the design work is marvelous, and the style is impeccable. Whether establishing mood or delivering awesome, unforgettable epic action(in the form of bad-ass gun-play and intense, high-speed chases), this hits the nail on the head. I saw the English dub version, so that is the only one I can comment on: The voice acting is masterful, no performances felt off. Music is cool, with a lot of jazz, and in general, the sound-side of this is magnificent. The plot is engaging, and the pacing is spot-on, never losing the audience's attention. Editing and cinematography are amazing, and this has tons of incredible visuals. The humor varies a tad, with a couple of really funny jokes and gags. Language is moderate/strong. There is sensuality and hints towards sexuality, though no nudity in this. Also, the violence can get bloody, and there is disturbing content in this. I recommend this to any fan of Animé. 10/10",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
5,Mr-Fusion,"A visual treat, and a welcome back to the show",7,21 January 2015,"My mistake with COWBOY BEBOP: THE MOVIE was that I'd watched this (back in '03) before watching the series. But having just blown through all 26 episodes, the movie feels like you're falling back in with the old crew on a new adventure. As such, the movie nails what it sets out to do: COWBOY BEBOP on the big screen. Familiar characters, great soundtrack, and boosted production values; really well done animation (this is really nice to look at), grandiose shootouts, firefights and a very nice aerial dogfight. It ratchets the violence to surprising heights and just feels larger in scope. The science bogs down the story, but it doesn't take long to get back in the groove.It's a nice capper to the series. And after what Spike goes through in this movie, adds to the final moments in the series' finale (he doesn't make out, at least to me).Good stuff.7/10",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
6,siderite,"A good anime movie, breaking a lot of the patterns in the genre",8,16 December 2005,"I really enjoyed this film. I didn't watch the series, only one episode, but I felt that you didn't really need to see the episodes to understand the movie.I thought that the intelligence community in the movie was really weird, but the atmosphere was very nice. Bio terrorism, hacking, human dimension, all blended into a nice mix, without dazzling with strange and implausible technology.I liked the extra footage after the credits, where they show the people in the city they saved, as to bring an extra value to the actions in the film. The sad-romantic-warrior theme is common to Japanese films, but still enjoyable.I think it is definitely worth a watch.====== after watching the seriesThe series is great and I felt awful when it ended so abruptly after what it seemed like a few episodes. The film captures the ideas in the series very well and this is something very few series manage to accomplish.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
7,ericstevenson,Good to see everybody here,9,19 May 2017,"It's hard for me to address ""Cowboy Bebop"" seeing as how it's the highest ranked anime of all time here. Well, actually ""One Punch Man"" has since gotten a higher rating, but you get the idea. I just love being introduced to all these beloved characters. I've seen about one or two episodes of the actual show and what I saw was definitely good. Possibly the most enjoyable character is the lead Spike. I especially love this guy's voice. Even though he's gone through so much crap, he still remains calm and laid back through all of his struggles and is a damn good fighter too.Ed is nothing but fun to watch. I love her strange mannerisms, her voice, her talents and everything else. Faye is one of the most beautiful characters ever depicted in pop culture. And yeah, her personality's great too. It's of course great to look at the gorgeous animation, which is just as good as the actual show. I just love the atmosphere of the film and how it manages to have a distinct story separate from the actual series. I will admit some of the new side characters here could be better, but it's still a great movie. I simply can't say no to seeing all these classic characters shine. ***1/2",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
8,Irishchatter,Good enough movie!,7,28 September 2015,"I thought this film was alright, the English voice actors were really good like they showed how much they had put into their roles and not muck up. Although I have to say, the action is this should've been more active like it seems to be the characters don't know very much on how to kick real bad guy ass. Now when they were on the space crafts, it felt so real that I was either in Thunderbirds, Star Trek or Star Wars. One or the other, they were some good scene's. I didn't think the ending was the best because I would've thought Spike would kill Vincent and of course, win over Electras heart but unfortunately it was not the case!",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
9,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,14 November 2017,"Cowboy Bebop: The MovieThe upside to living on Mars is that you don't have to travel far for your anal probing.Mind you, there won't be much to probe if the terrorists in this anime have their way.Nearly 50 years after a dying Earth was evacuated in favour of life on Mars, the fleeting human populace once again faces extinction in the form of nanovirus. To prevent further attacks, the Martian government issues a generous bounty, which subsequently attracts Faye Valentine, owner of the spaceship Beebop, and her ragtag crew of bounty hunters, Spike Spiegel, Jet Black and a robotic dog.Based on the popular television series of the same name, this feature length animated adaptation will satisfy long-time fans of the series, but struggles to find new fans thanks to its somewhat goofy standalone narrative.Incidentally, life on Mars is pretty much the same as on Earth except the litter floats.Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
10,Rectangular_businessman,"Basically, it is like any episode of the original show. And that's why it is so good",10,6 September 2011,"I can't believe some of the criticism this movie received.Sure, it was like an extended episode of the series, but's that's the great about this movie. Being a big fan of ""Cowboy Bebop"" I loved this film, mostly because it had all the good things that made me like the original show in first place: The great characters, the excellent animation, the exciting combination of action, comedy and thrills, and last but no least, the magnificent music from Yoko Kanno and The Seatbelts.This is possibly one of most entertaining movies (animated or live action) ever made, being quite enjoyable without having to see the original series first.

The villain in this is the best villain in the whole series (well maybe after Pierrot Le Fou one) and I really loved how flawless he seemed, like he was unkillable and our characters stood no chance against him. Also, this is a perfect Halloween movie and also a perfect covid-19 movie!",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie

13,lewiskendell,I expected more.,5,7 July 2010,"""Well, that's a real shame. But, we're not cops and we're not from some charity organization. Sorry lady, we don't protect or serve. This is strictly business.""One word came to my mind after watching this. Unnecessary.I have been putting off watching the Cowboy Bebop movie for several years now. I'm a huge fan of the show, but I had heard and read so many mixed or negative reviews of the movie online and from friends, that I was hesitant to see it. In the end, though, I figured that any Cowboy Bebop had to be somewhat worthwhile. That turned out to be partially true, but I still find myself disappointed.To be blunt, the story was completely uninteresting. Each episode of the series was like a (good) mini-movie on its own, so I don't get why giving the creators more time to develop and tell this story, ended up producing something that wasn't nearly as engaging as any given one of the original episodes. It felt like the decision to make the movie came first, and very little effort was put into making a worthy plot to go along with it.The new characters are uniformly dull, much of the soundtrack was poor (How did THAT happen? Where's the jazz?), and the film as a whole felt disjointed, at best. I tried as hard as o could to like it all, but the most positive description I can give for my experience is ""meh"".I'll admit that it warmed my fanboy heart to see Spike, Faye, and the gang in action again. The animation was very good, and some of the action scenes were top notch. But without the great storytelling that we've all come to expect, I'd recommend this to only the most fervent Cowboy Bebop fan. You'd have much more fun in the same amount of time by just watching four of your favorite episodes of the show.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
14,brando647,One of My Favorite Animes on the Big Screen,8,22 April 2009,"I am not a fan of anime and it's rare that one holds my attention. Rare, but not impossible. COWBOY BEBOP was an exception to that, as I have been a fan since a friend introduced me to the series. I love the characters and the style, sort of a jazzed up sci-fi western. The movie finds the bounty hunter team of the Bebop in search of a bio-terrorist with plans of releasing a seemingly unstoppable virus upon the world. With a bounty of $3 million on the line, Spike, Jet, Faye, and Ed race to find him before he can strike again. I love the characters from this series: Spike is one of the coolest characters you'll ever find and Ed never fails to crack me up with her constant oddness.Fans of the television series won't be disappointed, as it maintains all of it's best attributes. I'm happy to say that, unlike American television-to-movie adaptations, it doesn't fail epically. The movie does feel as if you're watching an extended episode, but not in a bad way. For the most part, the movie moves at a sleek pace and rarely slows down. There were a few moments towards the middle that started to drag but they never lasted long. The film contains enough action and humor to keep you engrossed. In case you are wondering, the movie is also approachable by people who haven't been exposed to the series before. While it doesn't go into great length to explain character back-stories, it isn't difficult to fall into for the uninitiated. Boosted by a great soundtrack, I really enjoyed this feature length run with the Bebop crew and count it among my favorite animes and a great addition to my DVD collection.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
15,emasterslake,Great Movie.,8,10 September 2006,"I first saw this movie around December 2005. I didn't know a whole lot of Cowboy Bebop back then. So I checked out the movie to see what the series is like.And I did enjoy the movie. After seeing more of the TV series I enjoyed it more than before.This is what you'd call a filler for the TV series. It's like seeing a 4 parter episode. Takes place between Episode 22 and 23.It's October 2071( a few days before Halloween). On Mars, Halloween is celebrated as if it were New Years Eve. Spike Speilgel is still you're humble bounty hunter who has a dark past, Jet is still friends with Spike, Faye is still a young woman with an unknown past, Ed is still her naive self, and Ein is just the same Data Dog you'd see anywhere else.The Bebop crew are doing their usual routing including hunting down bounties and trying to get something decent to eat that's not in a Styrofoam cup. On one normal day on Mars, Faye saw a truck exploded on a highway and spotted a suspicious man who drove and escape from the truck.This was send straight to the news media that the truck is hazard with an unknown virus to medical experts. A great deal of people who were near the contaminated area are infected with the so called virus. This is a threat to the whole Mars economy, and the man responsible for it is worth 30 million Wolongs.That made the Bebop crew want to hunt down and investigate the scene of the crime.As the movie goes on Spike and his friends will learn more about the perpetrator and what the so called virus is. But will they prevent the planet of Mars from being infected with this unknown virus? Cowboy Bebop the Movie is as great as the TV series. It was made and done by the same team that made the 26 episode series possible. The animation, action, acting, backgrounds, and characters are all well done. Those who like the TV series will like the movie a lot. It's rated R for language and violence. So I recommend for mature audiences or those who know what the series is about.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
16,kenandraf,Very Good Anime Sci-Fi Film,9,6 April 2003,"Very good anime Sci-Fi film that is not as good as the TV Series overall.In comparison,the TV series had better screenplay and action hands down.Also,there was absolutely nothing new added to this new adventure.It was the same old stuff with more minutes and slightly less quality.The ending sequence was not good enough.Also,there should have been at least 2 or 3 more good fight scenes and less talk. BUT this Anime film is still one of the top ten all time best Anime films because COWBOY BEBOP ROCKS! Properly combines Noire,Rock-Jazz,Sci-Fi,Action,Kung-Fu,Drama,Comedy and Art-Filming......If one understands Sc-fi Anime genre,this film will be a hands down favorite. But the TV series is so incredibly outstanding,even this movie version could not compete with it.It would be better if one sees the TV series first.....then see this movie.Still,this movie is good enough to impress the genre fans who have not seen the TV series.To all Sci-fi Action Anime fans.....DO NOT MISS ANY COWBOY BEBOP shows! that would be a big nono ^_^.........",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
17,mikayakatnt,"More fanfic than lore, but still good",9,18 February 2020,"Cowboy Bebop is visual eye-candy. It's a genre-defining piece that deserves it place in animation history. The world it opens the viewer up to is unlike anything most viewers see.But this movie feels out of place in the Cowboy Bebop universe.Understand, the soundtrack, visuals, and animation quality was stellar. Each scene is astonishing. Everything about this movie I loved. Yet, the story, plot, and characters seemed out of place. Things that weren't introduced or done in the series was done in the movie.When has Spike ever flirted with other women in the series? He had a thing for Julia and Julia only. Who seriously says ""your friendly neighborhood bounty hunter?"" What happened to Elektra(?) after the end of the movie? So many questions unresolved.Most of the movie seems to be more of a fanfic than an actual piece of the Cowboy Bebop universe. A cash grab for the fanboys, of course.4/5. It's a great movie. You'll enjoy it too, giving that you're able to hold your suspension of belief as the crew travels around space not-New York.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
18,moviesleuth2,Impressive sci-fi thriller,8,3 June 2009,"It's kind of a shame that, for the most part, animation has been monopolized by family movies. There are possibilities for adult fare that only animation can provide (""adult"" meaning not just for the Disney crowd. The MPAA slapped this movie with an R rating, which is completely absurd. This is clearly PG-13 material). ""Cowboy Bebop: The Movie"" is an example. While the film doesn't do anything that couldn't be accomplished live-action (with the help of CGI), presenting it as an animated film gives it a unique feel.The film is a spin-off of the cult TV series ""Cowboy Bebop,"" which centers around four bounty hunters: the ultra-cool and fearless Spike (Steve Blum), the ""Art of War"" loving Jet (Beau Billingslea), the superficial Faye (Wendee Lee) and the computer genius (but otherwise insane) Edward (Melissa Hahn).On the planet Mars, a few days short of Halloween, a truck explodes, killing hundreds. The injured are afflicted with a mysterious illness that the top scientists can't understand. A record-breaking bounty is offered for the capture of the culprit, so obviously our intrepid heroes are on the case.Anime gets a really bad reputation. At least in the United States, when a person thinks of anime, they think of the TV shows like Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh, which, to people outside their core audiences (8-10 year olds) are regarded as complete garbage and an insult to what anime is. That's a real shame, because anime can be just as gorgeous and enjoyable as anything Disney has ever put out. Just look at the works of Hayao Miyazaki. While ""Cowboy Bebop"" is nowhere near as beautiful as Miyazaki's works, it's closer to the films of the Japanese master than it is to the crap that Cartoon Network puts out. It's not perfect (the flow is stilted, and it seems like there are minute pauses inbetween frames), but each image is very beautiful.The other factor that damages the reputation of anime is the dubbing. In the Cartoon Network crap, the dubbed lines are so awful they're torturous. Not here. The dialogue is well-written, and the voice actors are talented. There's no shame in watching it dubbed.Even the best animation can have rather childish plots, but ""Cowboy Bebop: The Movie"" was never meant for the under teenage audience. This is an intelligent motion picture. Apart from a complex storyline, it poses some meaningful questions about the nature of life and death. These are equally fascinating, and because of the way they are presented, haunting.The voice actors are solid. Steve Blum is perfect for Spike. He's a carefree guy who really just doesn't care about anything. Blum perfectly illustrates his personality, but he gives Spike a sense of wit and charm that makes him likable. Beau Billingslea is the lone weak point. he sounds too much like the hack voice-over actors on the Cartoon Network shows. He overdoes the gruffness, and even in the quiet scenes, he sounds like he's screaming. However, the dialogue takes it up a notch. Wendee Lee is solid as the stuck up Faye. She thinks of herself as a princess who is above both the work she's doing and the people she's with. Melissa Fahn is perfect as the scatterbrained Edward. As bizarre as the character is, Edward never comes off as a written character.Apart from the bounty hunters, there are two other characters that factor into the story as well. There's Electra (Jennifer Hale), the mysterious ex-soldier who works for a shady pharmaceutical company. She's a tough cookie, but the filmmakers are not afraid to show her weaknesses.Then there's the villain...One of the advantages of making a film animated is that the filmmakers can tailor-make a character. The physical appearance of the actor doesn't matter. The artist can draw the character exactly to his liking. No where is that more apparent than in ""Cowboy Bebop: The Movie."" The villain is truly frightening. He is drawn just so, and the impact, matched with the voice work, is terrifying. He will give you nightmares, guaranteed.One thing I liked is the music in the film. It's strange thinking of an action sequence being complimented by a jazz tune, but that's what we have here. But oddly enough, it works. I guess the word ""bebop"" from the title actually has some meaning.Adapting a TV show into a movie runs a risk of making an extra long episode. As a 30 minute show, the formula works. But it can't be stretched into a 90+ minute feature; a certain amount of changes have to be made (hence the term ""adaptation""). ""Cowboy Bebop: The Movie"" avoids this pitfall. There is no sense that this is three episodes strung together (like in ""Family Guy's"" film ""Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story""). This is a movie through and through.""Cowboy Bebop: The Movie"" may be hard to find. But it's worth seeking out, even if you're not a fan of the TV show.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie

21,refresh_daemon,A fun romp with some old friends.,8,13 January 2008,"Watching Cowboy Bebop: The Movie is kind of like reconnecting with an old friend. He's got the same sense of humor, the same style and you recognize him, but at the same time, he's matured. Perhaps he's grown sleeker, taken advantage of improved technologies, or perhaps gotten a little wide around the belly.Everything's back in Cowboy Bebop the movie. Because of the characters and plot as we know it, the movie probably occurs somewhere in the late teen episodes or early twenties episodes of the series, which has a positive and a negative effect. If you've already watched the series, then certain things don't surprise you since you know what happens to the characters later. Furthermore, because this was produced after the series, it also doesn't get to tangle with the central storyline of the series (they mythology), where the series, which was excellent even in the anthology episodes, really shined. On the plus side, it hits where we're most familiar with the series, before things get super serious and with the characters in the state that they spent most of the series.The story deals with a bioterror threat and the Cowboys get caught up in it, while trying to nab bounties to make a little change while in an urban city. There is no space travel or dogfights in space, but The Movie does take efforts to include a little of everything that the series has had (minus the mythos), so expect to see martial arts, gunplay, dogfights (but not in space), goofing off, hungry characters, Ed being silly and such.Unfortunately, the story only lives up to the high standard of a stand-alone episode of Cowboy Bebop, but despite the fact that The Movie is considerably longer than an episode, it all flows along smoothly and feels like you just watched a good two-parter rather than an episode that's been dragged out. Nonetheless, since we hardly get into the Cowboy characters, the story doesn't have the same resonance of the stronger episodes in the series. Instead we get to go deeper into a pair of characters for the movie, who have somewhat interesting stories, but aren't strong enough to really carry the emotional heft of the film since they aren't the protagonists.The art, on the other hand, is still gorgeous and the movie benefits from the widescreen aspect ratio as well as what appears to be an improved budget for the animation, as everything, from backgrounds to characters, are treated with a wonderful level of detail. There are a few scenes involving butterflies that are absolutely beautiful to look at. Furthermore, the sound benefits from a great surround sound mix, adding directionality and heft to the soundtrack. Finally, the score by Yoko Kanno is delicious to listen to and perfectly brings you back into the series while presenting some absolutely stunning new songs in the mix as well.Overall, Cowboy Bebop: The Movie is a fun ride. Although, in the end, it's not as strong (story-wise) as the more compelling episodes of the series, the art, the sound, the music and just getting to spend a little more time again with characters you've come to know and love makes this a thoroughly enjoyable film. Recommended for Cowboy Bebop fans--but you must watch at least most of the series before watching this. 8/10.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
22,dussaultjulien,"Other than the annoying English voice actress that plays Edward, this movie is pure gold",10,10 October 2019,"If you can look past the annoying voice actress who plays Edward, this movie is a great English dub version of Cowboy Bebop and has some extremely memorable, as well as fun scenes that really stay true to the characters as well as the original series. They're not a lot of shows where you can say that the movie is just as good as the series, but this is one of them. The Japanese and English dub are both fantastic.

Although it looks fantastic, some of the -best- looking anime to date, technical wise, I almost feel like it was the premise for a major arc in part (or whole) of a season of the show which was quashed from existence.Like I said, overall I enjoyed it, just not as much as the show. It looks amazing the acting is (of course) great and there are true moments of suspense, though I didn't really find myself caring too much for any of the new characters.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
24,ladymidath,The Perfect Anime Movie,10,27 January 2007,"Being a fan of the series, I was prepared to like the movie but I was not expecting to be so totally blown away by it. The story itself was exceptional, it was deep and thought provoking especially in today's political climate. The whole Cowboy Beebop gang was back, Spike, Jet, Faye, Ed and Ein and they were all a joy. Spike with his usual laconic laid back attitude, Jet, the strong almost noble father figure, Faye with her sarcasm and Ed with her out there, stuck to the ceiling personality...and good old reliable Ein. Each one was give great screen time and I loved the way that they were so very much themselves. With the exception of Faye's outfit. A little more skin this time, but hey, that's cool. Vincent would have to be the CB's best villain yet, except for Vicious of course. But I found him to be almost sympathetic. A man experimented on, then cast adrift in a universe that he no longer understands or can take part in. The scenes with the golden butterflies are quite simply breathtaking. One scene I did love in particular was the one where Jet, finding that everyone has taken off-blusters about how he doesn't care and that he's better off by himself, only to jump on Spike the minute he walks in like a worried dad. I have to say that Jet is my favourite character. Ed's encounters while pretending to trick or treat were hilarious and the fight on the monorail was perfect. Elecktra was a good character as was Rasheed and some old characters came back as well for some truly fun moments. All up, this movie could not have been better. You do not have to see the series to understand it, but it helps. Japanese anime at it's best.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
25,pinkarray,Not Cowboy Bebop,7,18 January 2017,"Story:First of all, the story raised some questions and I couldn't follow it. Something about people getting sick from nanomachines? The story didn't seem to do the TV series justice. It takes place around Halloween and the characters are off to try and defeat Vincent and there's a tower that looks like an Eiffel Tower. The Halloween plot just seems to be unnecessarily added in there just to make Vincent look freaky than he already is.Characters:It was nice to see the characters especially Spike again, but I always felt that this movie was was disappointing compared to the series. I felt that something was wrong with the characters like Spike. He just seemed quite persuasive. Vincent is a terrible villain. He's just a Spike copycat for Spike to try and relate to and also defeat.I didn't really think much of Faye and Jet, but Faye in here was annoying with her talkativeness about going out on the race track or something.Electra minus her know-it-all personality seemed like she could be a good character but the end ruined it for her. If Vincent was the guy who wanted to terrorize other people, why was she still in love with him? She's beautiful but this whole love story at the end was contrived.Animation:The Cowboy Bebop animation looks more exciting and surreal than the series. There is some fast camera movements. Though, Spike's clothes look darker than in the TV series. But the problem is that one minor character kept moving his arms around when he was frightened and he was talking to Vincent before he shot him.Voice acting and music:The English dub was probably the best part of the movie. I liked how well Steven's voice captures Spike's interest for Electra, and like the series, the other voice actors did well capturing the characters' personalities. Though, I don't know about Vincent, I think he still needs to shut up. The music captured the emotions well. Though, the music isn't jazzy, disappointingly, but oh well, it sounds more country-like and the music sounds catchy. I don't like country music but the country music here sounds pretty catchy. OverallIt's pretty good for a Cowboy Bebop movie. It has pretty high re- watch value because I loved some of the characters but I still thought the series was more interesting.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie

It had almost everything the anime did: the loveable cast, the fast paced action scenes, and a good plot.It was great to reconnect with the Bebop crew again, too. Despite being made years after the original anime, none of the characters act out of character. It was delightful to see how little the creators changed! And even the new characters were interesting, though the villain was still a bit weak to me.Overall, I'd highly recommend to fans of the anime!",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie

I admittedly was not a huge fan of the series, but it had lots of potential, here's where the potential was finally unlocked.The Story: Not too much to say. The plot is rather hard to understand. A man who lost his memory wants to wipe out all mankind. Perhaps because he believes he died long ago maybe? The Voice acting: Just as good as the series. The cast has not lost a step and Steven Jay Blum has got to have the coolest voice over ever.The Animation: Awesome. The animation is great. How anime has improved over the years. Especially the scene where Spike defends himself with a broom. It looks fantastic.Well, that's a lot here along with a pretty cool villain as well. This also has a much better conclusion than the series.The Last Word: Fun. Possibly for the fans only. Bebop should make movies from now on. A solid presentation.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
28,Shostakovich343,Cowboy Bebop: The Movie,7,13 July 2018,"Basing a film on a popular series has never been a good idea. The average cinema crowd will be underwhelmed by the result, having missed several seasons of character building, while little innovation will be tolerated by fans of the series. Thus, most standalone films end up as little more than feature-length episodes. Considering this, ""Cowboy Bebop: The Movie"" is about as good as it possibly could have been. The film indeed runs like a longer episode, using its extended runtime to carefully set up the events and allow more action, which is well-integrated in the plot, and as masterfully animated as ever. The sparsely used computer animation is better than before, and more attention has been spent on impressive set pieces, all while keeping in tone with the beloved style of the series.The story, however, comes across as somewhat sterile, establishing rather than developing its characters and adding a small dose of existentialism to simulate depth, while favouring action. Especially considering how some episodes could provide genuinely touching drama within the time span of 25 minutes, a little more inner conflict would have been appreciated - but then again, seeing how the film takes place during the events of the series, it may have been wise not to interfere with the character arcs too much.Ultimately, ""Cowboy Bebop: The Movie"" has not much substance, and will not likely attract new audiences, but the film is highly entertaining, and a treat for those who have enjoyed the series (or Tim Burton's ""Batman"").",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
29,toqtaqiya2,A complex dramatic film that humanizes the anime genre as it delivers the thrills.,7,11 September 2010,"The film followup to what is one of the most respected anime series ever does not disappoint. The animation was given a boost. Since the story takes place on Mars (a few days before Halloween) this time expect to see plenty of eye candy. Mars, in Cowboy Bebop, is very much a multicultural place that reminds one of New York City and Tokyo. There is a strong presence of Arabesque atmosphere along with psychedelia. The story itself is a straightforward one, very similar to any one of the episodes of the series. This time, however, the Bebop crew face a much deadlier opponent. In some ways the story isn't original. We also don't really learn anything new about the main characters. The focus in the film is on the villain and his motives. Yoko Kanno put together another impressive soundtrack for the film. It features some memorable tunes that seem perfect for what's taking place on screen. Overall, the film is entertaining and action-packed. There's nothing particularly new or great here, but it's a solid addition to the TV series. If you haven't seen the series before then the film is a good introduction to the world of Cowboy Bebop. I heard that the story here takes place between episodes 22 and 23 of the series. I definitely recommend seeing it.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
30,frankgaipa,No Tank!,6,1 June 2002,"Clearly I'm bucking the flood of ""10's,"" but my heart sank when ""Heaven's Door"" began not with the series' signature theme, but with some country/rock-ish thing I still can't remember though I've watched the intro three or four times. Ditto, the close. ""Tank!"" and ""Space Cowboy Blues"" are unforgettable after a single listening. The film itself hits the mundane and the apocalyptic all wrong. Its convenience store intro, sad case of a creative group that horseplayed to success (see the extras on the series disks) now trying too hard, belongs in any of dozens of throwaway crime flicks. Animation adds nothing. The series' down-and-out-bored-in space intros, pastiches of silence and humor, do the same thing better. The best Cowboy Bebop episodes were tweeners, that had nothing or little to do with Spike's or the others' back stories: the one in which Spike meets the goofy ""real"" cowboy, etc., etc. The extent to which even I doted anyway on the back story episodes, shows care for the characters elicited by the stand-alone episodes. Just look back at the play in the titles: ""Pierrot la (sic) Feu"" nothing to do with Godard, ""Boogie Woogie Feng Shui,"" ""Toys in the Attic,"" ""Cowboy Funk,"" etc. This film betrays the series' glorious illusion of improvisation. It held my attention. I can, as I fear other fans are doing, rationalize a liking for ""Heaven's Door,"" but it was seldom fun.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
31,mweston,3 stars (out of 4),7,11 January 2003,"This animated film opens with a convenience store robbery, which is stopped, although not without incident, by Spike Spiegel and Jet Black. The initial assumption, at least by viewers like me who are unfamiliar with Cowboy Bebop, is that Spike and Jet are cops, but it quickly becomes clear that they are bounty hunters. The attitude is completely different.Soon we are introduced to the rest of the Bebop crew. Faye Valentine is a woman who more or less holds her own with the guys, but is drawn with unrealistically large breasts. A young girl with the confusing name of Ed (short for Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV) is the computer expert of the group, but seems pretty clueless in all other areas. And Ein (short for Einstein, I think) is a dog who seems to have human-level intelligence, although this wasn't explained.The main plot begins when Faye is going after someone who is in a hijacked chemical truck. As she closes in on him with her seriously futuristic flying vehicle (this is *not* set in the present), the truck explodes and all the people nearby die. But Faye sees someone, who does *not* look like the person she was chasing, leave the truck and walk away unhurt.My favorite part was the opening, and the film seemed to drag a bit in the middle. The funny bits seemed to work better than the action, and the drama didn't work at all for me. This Japanese anime film is based on a television series of the same name, and it seems to me that perhaps this film was stretched out a bit longer than it should have been. But the fun parts were good enough to make me glad I saw it, and the music was good too.Seen on 11/8/2002 at the 2002 Hawaii International Film Festival, where this showing was sold out to a very enthusiastic audience, who mostly seemed to already know all about Cowboy Bebop.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
32,Vincent_B,Excuse me I thought you were dead?,7,13 October 2008,"I have watched the entire TV series and anyone who saw the last two part episode ""Real Folks Blues"" would agree with me. Spike died killing Vicious, at the end he lifts his finger at the remaining syndicate thugs and says, ""Bang."" and collapses on the steps. Now are we to assume that one of the thugs yells, ""Hey, get this man to a doctor!"" after the credits roll? That issue aside, this movie is rather typical of the series but lacked the comedy relief the series had in so many episodes. I could have called it a ""filler"" since Spike didn't exactly say his girl died, at least in the English dub I watched he never said it to Electra while in the cell. So I tend to look at this movie as being somewhere in the middle of the TV series and not after it in the time line.The plot drags quite a bit and lacks the thrill, suspense, and laughs the series had going. Even without watching the series or comparing the two together, this movie was still very average and was obviously held back by the 9/11 attack. There was some very Arabic characters one that lit Spike's cigarette with a grenade lighter. Probably funny to most prior to 9/11 but not politically correct humor today.Edward is always a riot but the character was not used fully in this movie. Even Jet Black seemed to take a backseat in this movie as he sat aboard the BeBop and worried about where everyone had gone. It could have been a lot better with less of the drama scenes of Vincent gazing out a window waxing about life and death and more of the antics we expect from the crew of the BeBop....See you later Space Cowboy!",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
33,evansjoshyr,Proof that practically ANY episode in cowboy bebop could be turned into a feature length film,10,11 November 2021,"Three years after the show ended, the quality, the voice cast and the animation is as good as ever only now with a bigger budget and more time to flesh out the action, characters and plot.One of the things I love about the show is how fast paced it is as to cram in everything in just 20 mins. This means every single line of dialogue is important and if you drift off, you might be lost. This also makes the episodes so damn rewatchable.But then with a feature film, there is a worry that, because there is no need to cram information, the dialogue would be less subtle and even over explain to the audience (like many other anime) but thankfully, this film still feels just like cowboy bebop. The script is still phenomenal.An excellent adition to the cowboy bebop world. I cant wait to rewatch it.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
34,Mulliga,A decent feature-length episode of an incredible series,8,29 July 2003,"I'm a diehard ""Cowboy Bebop"" fan, so I have to be honest in saying that the movie version fell a bit short of my expectations. It's not bad, and actually very good at some points, but it's about ten minutes too long and not quite up to the quality of the best episodes in the series (""Ballad of Fallen Angels,"" ""Cowboy Funk,"" ""Pierrot Le Fou,"" ""Real Folk Blues"").(spoilers)Jet never gets to DO anything (I know he's a homebody, but he never even meets Vincent), and Faye, Ed, and Ein are mostly relegated to sidekick duty. There aren't enough fights (there should be at least seven or eight, given the 114 minute running time - 4 episodes in the series worth), and bits like the air combat seemed tacked on, as if Watanabe was saying, ""We HAVE to have air combat - it's Bebop!""Spike is pretty good at contrasting with Vincent, and Kanno and the Seatbelts' soundtrack is superb (perhaps even better than the phenomenal TV OSTs), but these are ultimately not enough to make the film as good as it could have been.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
35,Better_TV,"Compulsively Rewatchable, but Might Not Win Over Anime Neophytes",8,2 April 2018,"This 2001 feature based on the anime series of the same name flirts with being the perfect introduction to anime for viewers unfamiliar with the genre, but be warned that some of its cliches might still put off non-converts. Highlights include:-A mostly great English dub, right down to the ancillary characters. Steve Blum will be associated with the wiry, perpetually unperturbed spacefaring bounty hunter Spike Spiegel till the end of his days, and here he imbues the character with an infectious joie de vivre and a flirtatious attitude to go along with new one-time love interest Elektra Ovilo. I also loved Nicholas Guest as the mysterious Rashid, as well as Michael Gregory as the soft-spoken (though stereotypical) Native American chief Laughing Bull.-Impeccable music. Yoko Kanno's versatile and jazzy tunes are layered over explosive dogfights and tranquil strolls in equal measure. Her music remains one of the most vital reasons to watch the original television series, and it is a major draw for this film. Most of the tunes are joyful and exuberantly funky, as if they were lost Motown classics. But there are quieter, contemplative pieces too, especially towards the end of the film.-Jaw-dropping action scenes. The fight choreography here has to be seen to be believed. Scenes from this film have indisputably gone down in animated film history: the hand-to-hand fight between Spike and Vincent on the speeding frail line, the wild aerial battle featuring vintage WWII biplanes and futuristic fighter aircraft; the improvisational fight between Spike and Electra where the former's weapon of choice is a broom handle; the final, vicious confrontation between Spike and Vincent during a rainstorm. These will suck in just about any viewer, and they almost all top even the better fights from the TV series.An interesting plot. There's a bit of a mystery here, so viewers can get their procedural fix too. Interviewing leads and pursuing suspects involves some actual detective work that leads to a sinister bio-tech company with a front as a generic pharmaceutical entity. As in the show, the main characters (Spike, Jet, Faye, Ed, Ein) all go off on their own in pursuit of the truth, rather than sticking together as a group; they're all loners at heart, which especially became apparent in the final episodes of the TV series.-Moroccan Street. The director wanted to explore a different cultural setting than he had in the TV series, and the scenes that take place on ""Moroccan Street"" provide a unique Middle Eastern aesthetic that feels both respectful and celebratory. The art department was clearly fascinated by Middle Eastern culture, and it shows. Don't know of any other anime that pays this much reverence to the style of the Mid East. What is unfortunately generic is the villain, Vincent. Clad in a billowing cape and with a hilariously dead stare, plus an unintentionally ridiculous voice by Daran Norris, he's about as stereotypical as a self-involved suicidal terrorist mastermind can be. His vampiric appearance is occasionally effective when he sets off bombs or kills one of his lackeys, but his backstory couldn't be any hokier. He creepily romances Faye and Electra; it all comes across as comically emo.Other odd anime-isms that might threaten this film's consumption by a non-anime watching audience include the character of Ed, who is just as loopy as she was in the TV series. She'll be endearing to anime fans and off-putting to everyone else, though Melissa Fahn's performance is great. There's also some slapstick jokes that might feel out of place to neophytes, as well as some cartoony characters like the old coots who help out in the dogfight scene. And the runtime is a bit long at two hours.Still, this is one my favorite anime movies. It's slick, sexy and cool, with a familiar Westernized flair that distinguishes it from other kookier shows and movies in this Japanese medium. I recommend it.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
36,SSJAniFan,BEBOP RULES!!!!!,9,7 July 2003,"I've been one of the lucky people able to see Cowboy Bebop:  Knockin' On Heaven's Door at the box office.  It kicks so much ### on so many levels. Featuring just about the entire main TV series cast at one point or another(with the exception of TV villain Vicious), it is one of the best movies I've seen in 2003.The plot is a bit haunting, especially with the bad guy being a bio-terrorist, but then again, this was made back in 2001, before any of the stuff was going to happen.  I'm not going to say much, except it is a bit hard to understand if you only see it once.  Also, it helps to better understand the characters if you've seen the TV series.Yoko Kanno once again composes the music, and it's awesome.  Just about every tune perfectly fits in with the scenes.And what scenes they are.  The action scenes kick dirt in the faces of most live action movies I've seen recently.  The fight scenes literally make the weak action in the Matrix films look like ballet.  Just see the fight at the end of the film and you'll know what I mean.  It's just...... wow.  I can't really describe it without spoiling anything, and I do not want to do that. Another thing good about animation... you can get away with stuff you could never do in live films, without a ton of CGI.  This helps when you see some really big animation stunt.  And of course, it couldn't be CB without one of those awesome chases in Spike's ship, the swordfish.BOTTOM LINE:  With the DVD out at most stores, including places like Walmart, you have no excuse to miss this thrill ride.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie

It is on a par with the quality of the series (unlike, say, Naruto, Rah Xephon, Evangelion, The Simpsons, Futurama, etc.) and then also has even nicer coloring, animation and so forth than the TV show.There is a completely original soundtrack by Yoko Kanno which just slays, and the songs feature lyrics directly referring to the storyline and characters. No way, son! Also, the fight scenes are some of the best ever animated or put to film, the voice actors are top-notch (I hate English dubs, but even this dub is tolerable) and if you watched the series, you get to see a bunch of cool character cameos. Yes!And thus it was agreed: hooray for Cowboy Bebop, perhaps the most flawless anime ever produced! Yes, I know you like some more obscure anime that is more relevant to your life and you consider to be specifically YOURS because no one else in America knows about it, but let's face it -- you're a troll.

Again to review the pluses fall under music, animation and story.The animation and music are actually even better than in the series and though the only drawback is that it pretty much is one drawn out episode this movie is still worth your viewing if you like the series or would like to enjoy that Bebop feeling again or if you are just looking for a stand alone movie.For those of you unfamiliar with the series this film makes a good action flick with a compelling story that will have you watching.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
40,Nigel St. Buggering,Rather on the slow side for the Cowboy,6,27 November 2004,"Fans of Cowboy Bebop will find everything that the series does right on display here. The action sequences are excellent, particularly the martial arts scenes, which display more fluid and complex choreography than any animation in memory.However, while the action standards of the series are met, there's little character. The new additions are more fully developed than the series regulars. And while the save-the-world plot machinations keep the story moving forward, it's nothing particularly special.What really left me cold was the bad guy. As any James Bond fan can attest, a hero is only as good as his villain, and the film-makers try their best to give Spike a worthy adversary. While his martial arts prowess gives Spike a run for his money, his motivation makes little to no sense. They were apparently trying for an extreme nihilism angle, but he instead comes off as pointless. The man is clearly deranged, as he can't decide whether he's living real life or a dream, and wants to end it all. But how exactly does releasing a plague that will kill everyone but himself solve his problem? Wouldn't suicide be a more sensible option? Nevertheless, he holds forth on his dilemma at great length to anyone who will listen. The writer clearly believes that this is all quite fraught with portent, but it comes off as pretentious and dull.When a series is expanded into a movie, fans expect to see something bigger and more important, and which hopefully fleshes out the characters and brings some growth to their stories. Instead, we get what would be a rather mediocre episode at thirty minutes expanded to nearly two hours.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
41,angelynx-2,"an extended jam on an established theme, with improvisations",9,3 July 2002,"I'll try to avoid echoing other comments here and cut straight to the chase: This is not perfect, but MAN it's so close. I had some trouble with the pacing, which seemed a bit slow to me--as if they weren't quite sure how to work with a feature-length timeframe; I'm still a bit hazy on just how the villain's threat was resolved, which I'm usually not after a CB episode; and gosh, *why* isn't ""Tank!"" on the soundtrack?  Songs with words just don't cut it in a CB score. --But honestly, those seem like such small problems next to everything that's wonderful about this movie. It has all the stuff you love about Bebop the series: the brilliant, flashing action and fight sequences, the character interaction, Spike's nicotine jones =), the gorgeous cinematic visuals, and the dreamlike melancholy that underlies even the funniest moments.  The villain, his grip on the fantasy/reality divide completely erased after a genetic experiment on Titan, makes a neat counterpoint to Spike, forever haunted by his dreams of the perfect future he once believed in. Jet's protective concern for his reckless teammates was never better painted than in a scene where he blusters about how much happier he was without any of them and couldn't care less where they are, only to pounce on the phone's first ring like a worried mom on date night. There's just a *little* more of Faye's skin for the fanboys (but only a very little bit more, honest! we're not talking topless here! x my heart!), Ed has a trick-or-treat encounter that would never make it to American TV,  and even the Big Shot duo put in an appearance (despite having absolutely nothing to say). It's not intended as a wrap-up or finale to CB the series; it occurs in between episodes and should be thought of that way, as an experimental episode both different from and similar to the original sessions. Kind of like an extended jam on an established theme, with improvisations, in the true bebop style.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
42,stargunner,A tribute to the series itself,10,21 April 2003,"If the Cowboy Bebop series in itself was unsatisfying, this film will fill that void. The crew of the Bebop is still intact, along with 2 new characters, Vincent and Electra. Vincent is the antagonist, a man who cannot tell whether the world he is in is a dream or reality. He is the in the center of a biological weapon crisis, a new disease that degrades the human brain. Electra is a policeman, who ends up helping Spike & company attempt stop Vincent from spreading this biological disease. It's just like any other episode of Bebop - a wild, thrilling goose-chase for a bounty, except that it's 2 and a half hours long, the animation is even more enthralling and the tension is higher. The story itself may confuse you for most of the film, but that won't stop you from watching it.

43,josephrygaard,Before Watching: Cowboy Bebop: The Movie (2001),7,27 June 2019,"""Cowboy Bebop: The Movie"" (2001) is a great anime, however, if you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:This movie does not shun away from brutality. Violence isn't served in excess, yet when it arrives, it brings with it a fair portion of blood and realism. Characters will get shot, stabbed, beaten, die in explosions and other mystical circumstances, as well as falling off bridges to name the more common methods. For the weak of heart, this should be remembered. Minors should be kept away.In the same way, there are also occurrences of semi-nudity, with female characters wearing minimalistic clothing while having generous chests, one of which gets half revealed during an impending rape (which nevertheless becomes interrupted). Other moments during the movie can be somewhat suggestive, enough to repeat that this is not a movie for minor or for people who sits comfortably at the more conservative end of this category.Finally, Cowboy Bebop is a very mature anime. In addition to what's been brought up, it deals with the question what makes one's identity, and what's real and not. It doesn't dive too far down those oceans, but it is brought up enough number of times to state that it does require its audience to ponder it. If one accepts this challenge, one will not only have a thought-provoking entertainment ahead, but also an entertainment which features well-made characters, choreography, and a great, energetic soundtrack.My personal grade: a fresh 7/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
44,d4v3cs,bad....FDA,1,17 May 2002,"what's this?the storyline is nothing but exploitation of action scenes, even the soundtrack is just too mesmerizing. This reminds me of Final Fantasy the spirit within where most critics mention that the movie is just a show off of special effect with awful storyline.The usual bebop characters are just put down into some manequine-class action: FRUSTATING!and what's with Faye? This will be rather subjective but I like the lady a lot despite her fashion style (she never appear cheap though, so treat her with respect). And in the movie.....what the....whoever write this script and direct it must be one horny person or someone who is trying to meet the demands of the horny fans; DISGUSTING!The only part I enjoyed were the common bebop jokes and a tiny characterization of Faye and Spike in one part....Well like I've mention, if you are a true bebop fans who reach personal level of the characters, don't bother with this one.

I love the show just as much but I think it's the movie that is very underrated. The film is set on Mars where a lethal toxin is released and a group of bounty-hunters want to find out who and what is behind this terrorist attack. These characters are so well utilized, they are witty, funny and likable. The plot is also very well handled by setting up the villain Vincet as a shadow figure. We are interested in who this guy is, the villain is calm and well calculated but at the same time, he is very insane. Overall definitely check out Cowboy Bebop the movie if you are a fan of sci- fi.

But Wantanabe not only managed to be true to the original manga-series he made it perfectly fit into the totally different structure of a motion picture with all the laconic glory it deserved. Surprisingly it is a lot more violent than one could expect plus it has a sublime nihilistic attitude and a lot of really sad moments which make this movie only more lovable. I really hate myself for not seeing it on the big screen. It's so beautiful.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
47,Simarium,Cowboy Bebop: The Movie,6,7 May 2018,"Pretty decent movie, and it's nice to see the characters after not having watched Cowboy Bebop for many years.

Regardless, it was a fun watch with a friend, and I can recommend it for a lazy day.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
48,mattwakeman,in the shadow of the (much) better series,7,3 June 2002,"i suspect that one of the reasons that this film has such a high score is because it contains two very important words to many anime fans: 'cowboy bebop'. and thus it gets a lot of 10's. but it is because of its title that i cant give it that high a score.this is an ok film, better then sum (spriggan) worse than others but the problem is that it is going with one of, if not the, finest series of anime ever. the characters are there but the story and the dialogue were not. and this is a real shame. eye candy is fine but there must be more to it than this, especially when compared to the epic story lines of 'real folk blues'.
its ok, but with 'cowboy bebop' that just isnt good enough.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
49,rolfesam,See You Space Cowboy,9,14 August 2017,"Cowboy Bebop is without a doubt one of the greatest television shows of its time. It was smart and thought provoking and was more than willing to dive headlong into some pretty heavy philosophic themes in its episodes (especially in the later episodes of the series). But despite its brilliance, or perhaps because of it, the show never lost focus on the importance of emotion to the characters of the show and through them it helped to shed a light on the motivation behind their actions and helped allow the audience to connect with these characters which has helped them to remain iconic and loved nearly 20 years later. The best thing that I can say about this movie is that it continues these feats from its run on television to the big screen. The characters are the main focus of this film which ends up being both the movie's greatest strength and its ultimate failure. The people that watch this movie are more than likely to be fans of the original series and have thus have already become very attached to each of the four main crew members of the bebop and their own mentality over the course of the show's 26 episode run. The point to that is that the focus on the characters of this movie is simply the cherry on top of the already great franchise. We didn't really need it unless it helped further flesh out these 4 and provide new context to their decisions in the final episodes of the series. These complaints obviously don't apply to any of the new characters who I found very enjoyable except for the fact that I knew none of them would have any impact on the rest of the series. I wish that they had as it would have added to the importance of this movie on the franchise as a whole instead of the one-off adventure that this turns out being. Overall I don't think that this is a bad film at all. In fact I really enjoy this movie and think it would be great as a stand alone film, however as part of a series I just do not feel it to be a necessary addition to Bebop's legacy. That's not a knock on the movie really at all though because the music, animation, shot composition, and story are all really rather amazing. I just think that the movie would have benefited from being either more important to the main series or completely separated from it instead of being a tacked on extra long bonus filler episode that it ends up being.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
50,neonadventure,Cowboy Bebop Movie: What is it Missing? (SPOILERS),6,16 June 2019,"BEFORE YOU START DOWNVOTING ME, keep in mind that I still enjoyed this movie and tv show. (Watched the tv show 3 times in a year as a teen) I also haven't watched this movie for years but I still got some parts clear in my mind. ""Cowboy Bebop: The Movie"" is a continuation between episode 22 and 23 in the TV Show which in my opinion doesn't really matter because most of ""Cowboy Bebop"" has their own little short stories in them that doesn't do with anything over the main story of the entire show. The TV Show is definitely a must watch and I highly recommend watching it first before this movie as a fan since you might not get used to the style of this movie which holds a very jazzy and fluid motion into it's style.""Cowboy Bebop: The Movie"" starts off with a rather unintimidating bank robbery, the blue shoes of an important man walks into the store. He's wearing a headset, doesn't know what's going on. He is revealed as a chill guy because he is a chill guy. He pulls the trigger of a confetti and kicks the robber's face. Shoots the other people and the other robber is captured by a buff man coming from the ceiling. And here we are, the scene that we all seen in action films. The gun against the innocent person's head and our blue shoe man is pointing his gun at the baddie. Of course you know what happens to the robber, he dies of course. We've been introduced with a man that holds the power of Keanu Reeve's chillness.That cool man was named Spike Spiegel.The opening credits show a rather interesting black and white style of cinematography showing a normal routine of people's live. (Including cameo appearances of the voice actors of some of the main characters)To cut it short, ""Cowboy Bebop"" is mostly about a bunch of bounty hunters who are hunting bounty hunters and if you watch this movie, you won't miss anything about the main story of the TV Show. The TV Show basically has no links between the movie and the closest the movie has ever gone to even talking about the main story was when Spike was talking about his lover, Julia and just leaves it alone as if it was nothing and it is nothing in the movie anyways.Anyone can notice that the movie has taken a huge jump in animation as most of the animation is actually way more fluid than the actual show. It's almost like a 60fps especially when you watch the entertaining fights which is one of the greatest gifts that this movie holds that not that much other anime movies have. And who could forget about the magnificent music, the MUSIC!!! The several genres of music that Shinchiro Watanabe displays in his shows and movie give off a powerful feeling especially in the fight scenes of the show when the music is catchy, you'll be jumping along the beats.Now here comes the bad part of this movie. I noticed that some of the story kind of feels like the same as Episode 20 because Spike both gets injured after fighting against the villain of the episode and desires to come back to only kill that person or at least harm him. Even though it is nothing related to the tv show, it still feels like you needed to watch the tv show first as a literal requirement before watching the movie. Normally, I can adapt into films like ""Branded to Kill"" when Suzuki fans tell me that I should start off with his earlier works like ""Youth of the Beast"" first but it was too late but I still managed to adapt what I just say and loved. If you have the power to adapt into a movie or tv show easily, then you would be fine with this. I also felt like the reason why this movie didn't hold the force that the show had was because of the runtime. The movie had to be at least an hour long to be even considered a movie. (Basically now a rule and if under an hour, would be considered short film) The show was fast paced and was very energetic as Watanabe grabs you by the arm and pulls you through an imaginary ride of fun and jazz. The movie had to use that power and stretch as much as they could. Only problem is some of these scenes could've been easily ripped out or be cut down into a 23 minute episode. It was like a 20 minute lost episode that turned into a 2 hour epic that is all talking and is most of the time serious.""Cowboy Bebop: The Movie"" holds an energetic and jazzy look into a story which enhances the viewing but seems to lack that creativity that you would love to see. There are actually more serious scenes in this movie than fun which is the opposite way around for the show. (Unless if you're watching an episode that relates to the main story of the entire show)I certainly had something against this movie but not the show. As a fan, I DON'T recommend this movie IF you never seen the original show. BUT, if you watched, ""Cowboy Bebop"" then what are you waiting for!? The band is waiting for you!",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie

52,HPeep,"""The last party is about to begin."" The Greatest Animated Film Of All Time",10,2 November 2002,"VERY FEW SPOILERSCowboy Bebop is an incredible TV series with unforgettable characters, incredible storyline, brutal action, and odd humor. This movie fits it into 114 minutes perfectly.  Some people say it's bad. Don't listen! The movie is just like the TV show. Now the opening and ending songs are not quite what we would expect from Cowboy Bebop but they are still quite good. This movie takes place between sessions 22 and 23 because it would be very hard to make a movie that continues the series. This movie takes when Spike was carefree and not as concerned with his past as he is in the final three sessions. This movie partially explains why he goes back to confront his past at the end of the series.The villain Vincent, is superb and has a very (nay, extremely) odd motivation. He's going to unleash a deadly nano-virus to the people of Mars to see if he is truly alive or in a dream. Spike, Jet, Faye, Ed, and Ein have only a little more characterization than in the TV series. It's fun to see Big Shot again even though they have no information as usual. Yoko Kanno's music score is superb as usual, the action doesn't let up, Ed gets to go trick-or-treating (this scene is a bit off-color), Jet meets Bob again, stuff blows up.The animation is also top-notch. The fights are fluid and camera angles perfect. Vincent's past is a very well directed piece. Look for Andy in the Halloween scene. Grade: A+Rated R for strong animated violence, language, and sensuality.Note: There is a reason why this movie wasn't released in the US in 2002. The whole plot is about bio-terrorism.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
53,HPeep,"After seven viewings and countless times of listening to the music, my complete review.",10,23 November 2002,"VERY SMALL SPOILERWhen I did the last comment I made a few weeks ago I had not seen the film. I had read the translated script three times, watched the trailers at least a dozen times, and had listened to the entire soundtrack with an MP3 player probably four times. I knew what to expect and I knew this was NOT going to be much like the (almost) perfect television series. Many anime fans were appalled by the lack of ""Bebop-style"" and thought it was a throwaway version of the series. Lots of people had my opinion of the film and said that it was a great addition to the series. The movie was something like #8 on my top 140 films list. Now it is #2. Yes, yes. I know that it broke from the great and original style of the series but who cares? This is almost the same style but with a different twist and more action.The ending is bad and doesn't make sense you say? Look at the last two episodes of the series and it'll make sense (you fans know what I'm talking about).Okay enough arguments. The reason why I love the movie so much is the music, the action, the humor, the acting, the characters, Ed, the Matrix-like depth of the story, and the Halloween parade. My only complaint is that the movie doesn't make the aforementioned Halloween parade long enough. Oh and the whole Trick-or-treat thing with the gun maniac and Julius could have been cut. Overall the greatest animated film of all time and the second greatest movie of all time.The movie will finally hit US shores in January. Pray that Destination Films doesn't edit it for a PG-13. Until the American release date I'm going to try to watch it four more times. Grade: A+Rated R for strong animated violence, language, and sensuality.

55,imperial_wizard,impressive,9,28 December 2003,"I have yet to see the tv series, but the film is an excellent anime achievement, and really is more Tarantinoesque than it is sci-fiesque.

56,GavAnderson,Better than any Hollywood Blockbuster and one of the coolest films ever created!,7,17 February 2005,"Having never seen the series I had no idea what to expect when I saw Cowboy Bebop for the first time but when it finished I was quite honestly blown away! This films amazing. Unlike a lot of other Anime movies (such as Akira and Ghost in the Shell) Cowboy bebop isn't confusing at all but that's not to say it doesn't make you think. The plot is great and told brilliantly, weather you've seen the series or not doesn't matter. One of Bebop's strongest and most impressive features is the music. It really is amazing; probably one of the best sound tracks I've ever heard. The artwork Is top notch, its absolutely beautiful to watch and the action scenes are astonishing; Hollywood couldn't even dream shootouts this good! I have found with most anime that the directing is usually very good mainly due to the intensive planning that goes into each shot. Shinichirô Watanabe does a really good job here; I don't think there's a single shot in the entire film that I would call any less than brilliant.Bebop is cool. There's no other way to put it, from the characters to the fight sequences, its just plain cool. It's smart, funny and deeply entertaining. It is possibly the most universal anime I have come across. It really does appeal to all audiences, western or eastern. I hate to call it mainstream but it is, well at least the most ""mainstream"" anime I have seen. Any one could watch it and enjoy it; it could quite easily compete with any Hollywood film and would most probably win. 9/10 Bebop's dark and gritty feel, stunning artwork, brilliant soundtrack and engaging story all add up to make it a true masterpiece and my favourite anime of all time. Hollywood take note, this is how action films should be done!",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
57,dgalloway,A great movie based off a great series.,10,20 August 2003,"Normally, I'm not that big a fan of the anime movies we in the US get. Usually, they're either dubbed and censored to heck (Dragonball Z movies), cut and shredded apart (Digimon: The Movie), or simply terrible kid movies (every anime movie Disney released besides Spirited Away). However, this one stands out, not only because it's a good movie based off a TV series (which doesn't happen every day), but it's a GOOD ANIME MOVIE RELEASED IN THE US!Basically, it's set in between two of the last episodes in the series. An ex-soldier named Vincent seeks revenge against all of humanity. In order to get it, he uses a multitude of beads that contain a deadly nano-machine virus. If someone is infected, the nanomachines spread through touch, kill in minutes, then dissapear without a trace. So it's up to the crew to stop him to save the entire human race, although that $300 million bounty looks pretty nice, too...The characters are good, but I felt that the others should have gotten more screen time. Spike was basically the focus of the movie. He's the only one who really fights Vincent, he's the only one who catches Vincent, he comes up with the plan to stop Vincent, etc. I think I made my point. Although the others each have their moments (*spoiler* I really loved it when Ed ran into a gun-totting maniac and a transvestite while looking for Faye's target */spoiler), Spike is still the star here.Besides that, this is a great movie. If you're a fan, check this out. If you're not, then I doubt you'll understand it fully, but check it out anyway.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
58,Kurt_Cocaine,Anime for the action lover/psychology major...,10,25 May 2006,"Cowboy Bebop: Tengoku no tobira(Japan, animated, color, 2001) A.K.A. Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' On Heaven's Door or Cowboy Bebop: The Movie thanks to Bob Dylan's lawyers and the lackwits at Columbia TriStar Films Cast(French dub): Bruno Muellenaerts(Spike Spiegel) Arnaud Leonard(Vincent Volaju) Stephane Flamand(Edward) Shinichiro Watanabe's 1998 series Cowboy Bebop is considered by many to be a classic of animation on television, oozing style, violence and a great jazz-based score from every pore of it's existence. After a somewhat lengthy absence(long enough for Cartoon Network to release an English dub), the Bebop crew return in this fabulous film(released in North America in 2002 to some quite positive reviews from art house critics) that takes an interesting story and expands it in a way the series couldn't, there's some SERIOUS philosophical depth here, not as much as, say, End Of Evangelion, but enough for your average action flick.Opening with an insanely cool convenience store robbery sequence(replete with memorable dialogue and a cool ""fish-eye"" framing technique) and not letting up until it's VERY METAPHORICAL and beautifully animated ending. CB:TNT packs on humor, drama, thrills and DEEP THOUGHT by the crateful. You'll laugh, you'll scream, you'll shout ""THAT WAS F**KING COOL!!!!"", you'll have the distinct urge to crash a lecture on the human psyche! This movie has it all!Our protagonists are Spike(lazily voiced by a bored-sounding Muellenaerts), a slacking loser of a bounty hunter who harbors an ""interesting"" past, Jet(I couldn't find a voice credit for the French dub on IMDb), a ex-cop and master of vegetarian cooking, Faye(same as last note), a problem gambler with amnesia and Edward(given a soulfully bizarre lilt by Flamand), an androgynous female hacker with zero attention span and an unholy amount of flexibility(which she spends most of the film demonstrating). After a search for a local hacker with a five million dollar bounty on his head goes horridly wrong, the gang are left in pursuit of Vincent Volaju(Who Leonard lends an inherent amount of spookiness to), a bioterrorist with a military history who supposedly has been dead for the past three years., and really is!After close to two hours of comedy, violence and mind-f**k plot developments, the end credits roll and you may wedge your way from the edge of your seat. The film entertains on many a level and will more than certainly please fans of the series as well as newcomers. Despite me having the desire to watch it French, the film is best experienced with the English dub(close to flawless, expect minor characters are wooden and there are a few agitating accents) or the original Japanese(despite the ""authenticity"", I never enjoyed the Japanese voices for the Bebop crew, except Jet) with subtitles in a language of your choice.Verdict: 100/100, not be missed by anyone who loves action or anime.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
59,DrSmooth,"A Lot of Style, Not Much Substance.",7,22 March 2002,"Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door is supposed to be one lengthened episode of the series.  Instead of being typical Bebop, witty, action packed, and entertaining, it strives to be something more in light of the fact that it takes up more time.The main bad guy, Vincent is pretty messed up.  He has no real motivation. Why does he feel that the only way to figure out the solution to his dilemma is to kill off the entire world?  He doesn't know.  If you're going to create a villain who has decided to kill the world, he has to have a real reason for it, dementia, revenge, money, etc.  Having a guy who wants to kill the world, except for a few people he pretty much randomly picked to stay alive, doesn't make sense, and it isn't very fulfilling.  The ending too, is very abrupt, and doesn't have the same wrap-up as even the episodes do.Adding to my disappointment is that much of the film ends up feeling like it has been lifted from other places, namely, Neal Stephenson's ""The Diamond Age"".  Even the part where the Vincent gives Faye the ""cure"" for the nanomachines, is pretty much exactly the way the main female character gets her cure from the evil nanomachines in Diamond Age, a book published first in 1996.I would definitely have to recommend seeing this movie, but don't get your hopes up too much by reading all the rest of the lavish praise being flung about here, if you do, you're in for a real letdown.7/10.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie

I have seen this movie and I loved it.  The plot is involving and keeps the viewer involved in the story.The aspect of Vincent being the one who is searching for a way to see if he is really dreaming or awake is a nice twist from it just being Spike who wonders the question.  The soundtrack fits well with the action in the movie and heightens the action and suspense.The scenery is dynamic and the characters, the main cast as well as the new additions, carry the weight (yes, yes, I know they're not real) of the movie and the script which is well written and very Bebopish.

Seeing Spike getting the living crud kicked out of him by a villian worse than Vicious can be kinda haunting and painful, but the excellent story and animation make up for this. True, Vincent can be really freaky at times, but he is the ideal villian who, if he did turn good, could really kick Vicious's ***.

But the truth is that I actually got interested in Cowboy Bebop after seeing this movie. I had never watched the series before, so I had no idea, what to expect. But boy, it was beautiful. To me, Cowboy Bebop reminds me of why I feel so sorry for people who won't give anime a chance. I honestly don't believe that ANYONE, no matter what kind of movie they are into, are able to seriously dislike Cowboy Bebop. The humor, the the stylish art, the well told story and utterly interesting, deep and complex characters help this world move all of it's own. You should give this a chance, no matter who you are. It's really that good, and this movie is no different. Starting out in the old Bebop fashion, it tells the tail, of the hunt of another bounty for the Bebop crew.

63,thegreatgrundle,Not as good as the series,8,12 October 2003,"But still a great movie.  Most of the elements that made the series the best ever are present in the movie.  But I still don't feel that it had that extra something that made the series what it was.I think the thing that didn't work in the movie was that it was a stand alone.  You can argue that most of the episodes in Bebop were stand alone themselves, but I always felt there was a thread tying them all together. And sure, there were references to the world of Bebop (i.e. the scene in the jail cell), but they weren't in the same style as the series.  They didn't have the brief glimpses of the past, or Spike's flashbacks, that, when added together, built the Bebop series.  Of course, in a stand alone movie it wouldn't have made much sense, so I understand why they were omitted.  Also, I feel that the creators said all they wanted to say in the series, so adding more would have actually weakened the impact of the series itself.Mini Spoiler ahead.Another problem I had was the air battle with the army.  To me that seemed to come out of nowhere and accomplish nothing.  It looked like the animators were just trying to show off.  Of course, they did a good job showing off. It was the most beautiful sequence in the film, and the song ""What Planet is This?"" is a great backdrop.Anyway, those were the problems.  Aside from that, it was great.  The music was excellent, the animation beautiful, and the acting and direction really worked.  The villain, in typical Bebop fashion, wasn't all he seemed, and the plot was effectively creepy.So in conclusion, it was a great movie, but if you want the full Bebop experience, it is no substitute for the series.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
64,bayisatool,butter scrapped across too much bread.,6,12 May 2014,"I am a big fan of the anime series so when I heard about this movie I was super excited and my expectations were extremely high. And I really enjoyed the movie, though if I am being honest I felt a little let down. One of the biggest strengths of the t.v. show was that each episode was only 20ish minutes long. That meant that there was never any wasted time. Each episode could tell a cohesive story in a short amount of time. This movie just felt thin at some points because it felt like it was trying to tell a story that could have been told across 2 episodes. Also I didn't exactly feel like the story made you think either. Mostly because the theme of this movie has been addressed in more comprehensive ways in countless other shows and movies. However having said all of that I still had a blast watching the movie. The characters are still just as quirky and fun to watch as ever. The movie also has some wonderful fight sequences and the cinematography was just beautiful at certain points. Overall I think the movie does a decent job of capturing the feel of the original series.

Vincent and Eleka were cool characters but I've never felt like they were worth the emotional investment to really care. OK, so he thought his whole life was like a dream because they erased his memory. You poor baby, and now he's going to try to annihilate everyone. Couldn't really relate there because I was thinking, just move on then! Beside this, the TV series set such high standards and although it is unfair to compare the two, it really can't be helped.

67,dumiduh,Good watch.,7,10 April 2017,"Like the series, the movie toys with multiple layers of meaning. To me the series and movie both portray how some of us are unable to accept realities we find ourselves in as they are, how we fail to find meaning in what is and instead hold on for a 'how it should be'. A future that one may deserve but may never come true. Just as Spike fails to find meaning in the life he lives with the crew of bebop as he is consumed by his ghosts so does Laurence fail to see past the horrors he has endured. He asks Spike which is real, whether his life ended in Titan and everything after that point is a dream or titan is a nightmare which he fails to wake up from. The question is rhetorical, He already knows which is true but by failing to accept it he can cling onto some kind of comfort or a prospect of vindication. With his dying breath, he admits he was looking for a way out of the nightmare to which Spike ironically replies he should not have been afraid to open his eyes, the very thing Spike fails to do. Not everyone who deserves to leave purgatory gets to do so because there are no doors leading out, to begin with.

72,sunsetrider,"compromise between appeal to both ""cowboy"" faithful and neophyte",7,1 January 2004,"""Cowboy Bebop: Knocking on Heaven's Door"" is an animated feature based on a tv anime series (released on DVD) that has gained quite a following on both sides of the Pacific. It is interesting to note how Mr. Watanabe manages to pull off a balancing act required to satisfy both the loyal following of the tv series, to whom the introduction of principal characters and setting would be redundant, and to those who are relatively new to the ""Cowboy Bebop"" universe, of which I am the latter.To those not well versed in the ""Cowboy Bebop"" lore, it takes some time to get familiar with various featured characters. The film begins in the same fashion as any of its self-contained tv episode would, in that not a lot of exposition is provided for grasping the setting. The characters are more or less introduced as 'bounty hunters' and that is as much of a background the film lets on before establishing the main plot.It is not too much of a setback not to be given any opportunity to become attached to any of the characters. They are there to simply convey various scenes of the main plot and arrange them into place before they culminate into an oft-tread climax. The plot is briskly disclosed (rather literally spelled out by dialogue, no implication) and turns out to be a fairly mundane yarn that does not break any new ground in narrative nor provide any catalyst for any interesting character development or revelation.The symbolism and nuance that are laid thick in colorful locales and poignant sceneries may merit repeat viewings to appreciate them; a careful analysis of the film brings another level of enjoyment to overall experience. Also relationships between the characters and circumstantial developments of the plot seem to rely too impulsively on coincidence, not mindful of what the viewer is meant to discern. This could be attributed to attempting to weave a credible plot involving diverse elements and subplots in a limited frame of time, or it could have been something else relevant in the context of the ""Cowboy Bebop"" tv series. Some have suggested that this film is nothing but a figurative dream, in which the main character confronts the guilt of his past to help him proceed to his ultimate fate in the last remaining episodes of the tv series. If that was the case, then the film ends up being not as complete or entertaining to the ""Cowboy Bebop"" novices as it would have been for those well acquainted with the tv series. To that effect, it is rather disappointing.""Cowboy Bebop"" features lush animation that features some of the most impressive displays of action sequences put to cel, particularly the confrontation at the medical lab between Spike and Electra, not to mention the prolonged martial no-holds-barred showdown between Vincent and Spike. The character designs are fairly distinct and varied, although in some instances they linger a bit too long on stereotypical depiction of some races. The details given to many of the locales are unsurpassed in their variety and ambience; it is a testament to how artists went as far as to include references to mainstream culture, dotting the background with ""WcDonald's"" and ""Kodac"" (although I am lead to believe such play on words is the Japanese equivalent of product placement).The music is another highlight of the film, which is not unexpected of Yoko Kano, who is a renowned composer of anime soundtrack who have previously lent her resourceful talents to other popular anime such as ""Macross Plus"" (another collaboration with the director Watanabe). The compact blend of blues and jazz heightens the urgent mood and graces slower parts with an equally effective repertoire. I don't know about others, but I did not mind the dubbing of the film too much. Maybe because the voices are supported by a script that is partially altered to bring out genuine emotion to the dialogue and to resolve colloquial barriers between the languages.""Cowboy Bebop: Knocking on Heaven's Door"" is a good standard action romp that is further enhanced by superb animation, equally enjoyable music, and more or less succeeds both as a tribute to the series' fans and a good introduction of the series to those who might be interested in one of the better anime licenses to have come ashore.

73,noleinatx,Bebop at it's finest,10,14 October 2001,"For those who are not aware, Knockin' on Heaven's Door takes place during the latter part of the series' timeline.  This movie is exactly what every animated movie should be.  It has all of the elements that made the tv series so popular including some of the best hand to hand fight scenes to ever grace any screen.  The movie is supposed to feel like an extended episode of the television series but with a higher production value and it excels at doing so.  Any fan of Bebop will absolutely fall in love with this film and even those who have a limited knowledge of the series will be able sit down and enjoy it.It isnt licensed for American release yet, but a company will surely pick it up for DVD release in the coming months.

Anyway, I liked it quite a lot, but in some parts it just feels like the spirit of the show is lost - sometimes it feels like the characters have merely becomeoverused catch-phrase spouting devices, and the ending's a bit anticlimactic. That aside, the movie progresses well and there are some great actionsequences. Not to mention the music's great, as always. I give this one a 9 out of 10.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
75,EMDevilman,An excellent addition to an excellent series,9,6 May 2002,"Cowboy Bebop: Heaven's Door is neither a continuation nor a final conclusion to the Cowboy Bebop series.  It is an addition that serves to further enrich a series that was well-known for it's somewhat questionable depth of character.Fans of the series will appreciate this movie moreso than the casual movie-goer.  Those familiar with the series will understand the motives of the Bebop's crew better.  It is, however, able to be watched on it's own, with no previous knowledge of the series.For all intents and purposes, Vincent serves as a parallel to Spike, both characters having chillingly similar views on the universe and life. Vincent's missing past was not a choice, as it is with Spike, but his past is the reason why he has become what he is.Cowboy Bebop is well-known to ""borrow"" elements from books, movies, music, TV shows, and most anything decidedly media-related pop-culture.  Such is the case of he borrowed materials from aforementioned books and movies.Heaven's Door is decidedly well in keeping with CB's style, never getting in too deep with characterizations, instead depending on a myriad of subtleties contained in the dialog to promote character development and stories.There is some remarkable silliness, of course, which is a Cowboy Bebop trademark.  The entire deal with the old vintage airplanes seemed unnecessary, including the `cure' developed for the nanites.Don't get me wrong, this is certainly not the greatest film of all time, but it IS one of the best series' movies made, towering over others of it's kind.  It's a good, fun watch by anyone even remotely familiar with Cowboy Bebop.9/10",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
76,mrplaid2001,Sure to at least please fans of anime or good movies in general.,9,3 April 2003,"I'll start off by saying that I'm a huge fan of Cowboy Bebop. No other anime has characters that are as real and deep, yet fantastic and archetypical as this series. Every episode in the series manages to be visually stunning and/or humorous and uplifting while at the ame time being beautiful and poetic all in a twenty-minute timeframe. So its hard not to judge Coboy Bebop: Knockin' On Heaven's Door under the same light or along the same lines as the series. That said, the movie is very cool and very enjoyable, and from the fansub that I watched, I know I'll be snagging this as soon as (or if ever) it is released on DVD.After the initial five minute attention grabber and wonderfully cheesey rotoscoped-looking opening credits, Spike and the gang set off on the trail of a bearded bioterrorist worth 300,000,000 woolongs who plans to do some bad stuff to whatever planet it is they're on (I think its Mars, but I'm pretty sure they never actually say in the movie). Along the way, we get action, not-so-much action, Maracans, we get to hear some more awesome Yoko Kanno music, Spike reaffirms his position as the most badass character ever in animation, and we almost get to see Faye's boobies. The action scenes are superb, especially two in particular. Spike's first fight with the woefully underdeveloped Electra is easily some of the best martial arts animation ever. Also, the monorail scene is probably one of the coolest and definitely the goriest thing ever seen in Cowboy Bebop.The movie does, however, slow down at parts, especially when the focus is lifted from the main characters. A lot of times I just felt like I was waiting for the movie to pick itself up and get going again, something that never happens in the show, but, then again, this film is nearly two hours long (awesome for an anime). One reason the film seems so slow in comparison to the series is that there are a lot more establishing shots and the like. It makes you wonder whether Shinichiro Watanabe was trying to be theatrical or just padding the film. Its almost as though they got too good at pacing their own show, which, I suppose is a testament to the original series. Every storyline moved so fluidly and was paced so well that the movie seems sluggish in comparison.The movie's supporting characters aren't all that great, either. Electra is pretty bland, as is the antagonist, Vincent. That's kind of disappointing, since the Bebop crew was able to give so much personality to other lesser characters who had a lot less screen time in the original series (like Indian dude and the card-playing old guys, who both, thankfully, show up in the movie and play pretty cool roles in some scenes). Most of the other supporting cast is just fodder for Vincent to off to make him seem less likable. One thing that's sure to annoy a lot of people is Vincent's pseudo-religious rants and vague creepy-talk. The way that he talks and the way that others talk about him is a bit indicative of Shinji Ikari and Evangelion, but really not as good or interesting. If you look hard enough, you might be able to find some meaning in the symbolism they're trying to impose, but most of the time it will just come off as BS. At least he looks cool, and in the end, that's all that really matters in a villain.Electra, on the other hand, is just your average sterotypical good-lookin' hard-ass female cop-type person that shares a mysterious past with Vincent that really isn't all that mysterious or interesting. But the film is really about Spike and the gang, and none of the principal cast go neglected. Each character has some pretty cool/funny scenes, even Ein and Ed (who I'm sure annoys the hell out of some people). The sad thing is that there's none of the ass-slapping hilariousness of ""Mushroom Samba,"" nor is there any of the frenetic and fast-paced shooting action of ""Pierot Le Fou."" But we do get to see Spike use his 'leet jeet kun do fighting skillz to kick a fair share of ass. In terms of pacing and character development, the movie comes off as an extended version of ""Jupiter Jazz"" parts one and two, probably my least favorite episodes, sans any cool character revelations. I guess you can't really expect to learn anything new about the characters since the series tied itself up so nicely.In the end, though, ""Knockin' On Heaven's Door"" is freaking awesome. It may sound like I've been ragging on it, but that's just because the series is so awesome its hard for anything to hold a candle to it. So does the movie do the series justice? Absolutely, if you're a fan, definitely check it out, but you'd probably have to be a fan to really enjoy it. If the movie were a regular thirty-minute episode, it would be pretty forgettable. Even still, chances are that that's ten times better than most other anime out there.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie

Movies like these make me proud to be an anime fan. So much better than the standard Hollywood stuff we're soo used to know. Its good to know such great alternatives like this piece of true art exist to make for such a memorable experience.If you're going to watch this... WATCH it it ONLY in subtitled as dubbing can never be the same and the voice actors cant catch the essence of such powerful dialogues, in that regard the subs can be much better.

79,Goldenboy142,pure blissful Bebop,10,2 May 2002,"I have a been a close follower of the Cowboy bebop series for over a year. I loved the series for its high kinetic action and wonderful sense of humor. The series never seemed rush, and always delivered with perfect timing and execution. Its characters has many verisimilitudes that gave them incredibly believable. They're just a bunch that you cannot resist falling in love with. Furthermore, Yoko Kanno's music composition were simply amazing. The score often times over shadowed the series itself. However, the series redeemed itself almost immediately with the direction of Shinichiro Watanabe and the Keiko Nobumoto's script. When the series ended wonderfully and the movie was announced, I was skeptical to whether the creators are simply trying to cash in (which they deserved every right to do) or they still have enough in them for a big final showdown. Now having seen the movie twice, all my doubts were simply vaporized by what I had seen on the screen. The movie realized and surpassed all limitations that series had, and simply blew all my expectations out of the water. The gang that needs no introductions is back and more glorious than ever. In the movie they are brought alive once again with the talented crew. Shinichiro Watanabe once again gave us those amazing dogfights he specialized in, and impressed us with a-sight-to-behold fistfights. Keiko Nobumoto's script once again gave us a exciting adventure to embark on. And to top all of this off, Yoko Kanno's score breathed passions into every single frame. Cowboy bebop has always been acclaimed with its rich style and high production value. In ""Heaven's Door"", viewers are treated with powerful visuals polished with a high production value. Everything on screen animate extremely well and looked vibrant and eye-poppingly beautiful. There aren't enough words to describe how wonderful Cowboy Bebop is. It never set out to revolutionized the animation world, but only to entertained. That it did, and will do so in viewers' hearts for years to come. Bravo. 10/10",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie

The dialog is smart without being brainy and the whole thing has the same light-hearted feel to it that the series does.  That being said, the only criticism I can really level at Cowboy Bebop: The Movie is that it is too much like the series.  The movie is quite a bit like one or two of the episodes that we have all already seen (if you are a fan of the series).  If you have never seen any of the Cowboy Bebop episodes on Adult Swim or don't have the boxed set then you will still be able to enjoy the film on a purely visceral level as it has so many dazzingly executed sequences (the closing action sequence is amazing) that to not enjoy it you would have to be brain dead.  Even though the film doesn't deviate too much from the series (this is not really a bad thing either) everyone who likes action, anime and the intersection of the two should be thoroughly pleased with this film.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie

There is a perfect blend of action, drama, comedy and a great soundtrack that matches the quality of the Television Series (no Tank! Were is Tank!??) ((for those of you who don't know Tank! is the intro song for the Television Show.)) All of the characters are back in all their glory in this and it makes Cowboy Bebop: The Movie a perfect supplement to the series. Spike is laid back and funny as ever. ""I love the kind of woman that can kick my ass."" is one of his lines during an interesting scene. Faye is her beautiful, sassy, complaining self. Jet is bossy, and as determined as ever. Ed....Ed is just hilarious in this movie! Not as much as Mushroom Samba but just as well. She does this one thing that causes Spike to remark; ""She's like a trained seal. Maybe we can sell her to the Martian Circus.""As with all Bebop sessions the crew is after a bounty and this one surpasses all of the previous. 300,000,000 Woolongs for the capture of the person who was the cause of a tanker explosion on the freeway heading to Alba City on Mars. The thing is this tanker was carrying a virus like chemical that affected everyone within a 3 kilometer radius. So Faye, Spike and Jet all work together to capture the criminal and run into a lot of surprises along the way.Cowboy Bebop: The Movie is the perfect addition to any Bebop fan's collection. I highly recommend it. 5/5.""See ya space cowboy.""",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie

A+To be fair though, you must be at least a little familliar with the series to fully appreciate this movie.  The series itself is a masterpiece; in my opinion one of the greatest television series of all time.  The dub is a cut above most imported anime.  Dialogue is often underapreciated in an animated series, so dubbing companies will be indiscreet with selecting voice actors.

Final Fantasy doesn't even come close when it comes to the story and not to mention the 'actors'. The animation in Cowboy Bebop isn't 'life like' like it was in Final Fantasy but it doesn't prevent the viewer from forgetting that they are basically watching a cartoon.

The motion picture is basically the anime version of a summer action blockbuster, and in that respect the movie seems much more Americanized than the television show. Their is a rather decent plot however, with Spike and Faye becoming intertwined with Vincent and Electra, and some rather interesting foreshadowing done with the end of the television series and the movie. Without spoiling, I'll say Vincent's past catches up to him much the same as Spike's does as the end of the show. In totality, CBTM seems to be a climax before a climax. It's the last epic adventure the whole crew goes on together, and its the last time we see the characters acting like they do throughout the first 23 episodes of the television show. If you over-analyze this movie as some sort of magic bullet condensed version of every thematic expression and stylistic overture of Cowboy Bebop, you will be disappointed. Take it as a 90 minute action adventure flick with some familiar characters, entertaining fight sequences and witty dialogue, that pervade modern main stream cinema, and it's worth a rental.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie

90,nachothecheesyone,"Hard to find, but worth it.",9,23 April 2003,"I really am disappointed in the way this film was marketed.First of all, I had to drive about 90 miles to catch this film in Long Beach, to one of only 5 theaters in the area that even had this title at a non-ridiculous time (12:18 at night?!!)  Second, the little to no promotion of this film from Sony, Adult Swim, and Sunrise tells me that this is not a very low-budget marketing effort in any part (yet films like ""What A Girl Wants"" that fits a very limited audience is plastered all over the small screen) of a film whose plot lines rivals the completeness of any Miyazaki film.  Third, the only time I saw the trailer was online.  Why wasn't this in any theatre??Okay, petty ranting aside, this was an excellent movie... very well written, good for those who haven't seen the series at all, involving action sequences (Watanabe is an excellent director), and very interesting plot devices.  The soundtrack is superb (and I am very disappointed that there is no soundtrack commercially available for this title) with Mai Yamate doing an excellent job with the credits track again, just like music on the series episodes ""Ballad of Fallen Angels"" and ""Real Folk Blues"" Pt. 2.  Yoko Kanno and house-band Seat Belts made the mop-fighting scene irresistable, with stings from the song matching blow-for-blow the action on screen. Musically, this anime is alone a prime example of just how capable music can be on putting anime on a level playing field with other motion pictures.The disappointments?  Just a few:  (as we all are aware than no motion picture is perfect) the story did continue the plot line of the entire series, but it left Ed, Ein and Faye as more flat, predictable characters, as Spike and Jet got even more developed.  This leaves first timers to the series a little disdainful to otherwise very human performances in the series, as you see Faye change from gambler to jaded wanderer to almost back to where she belongs in the world.  In the film, she's just an annoying tag-along for Jet & Spike to take care of.SPOILER ALERT -- STOP READING FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIEAlso, one of the plot devices, the butterflies, were present in some shots of Electra and Volaju, but where were they with Jet and others, and why weren't people freaking out with this at the Halloween Festival?  If I was in that crowd, and saw those flashes of light, I'd think it was a cool effect, but when I got home, I'd be going nuts trying to make them go away! Also, with Spike, would the butterflies affect his already unnatural vision? It'd be annoying using a digital eye with those glasses with butterflies obscuring your vision!Aside from that, I was very satisfied with the movie, and can't wait for the DVD!",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie

However, I thoroughly enjoyed ""Cowboy Bebop,"" and that's probably the most important part. In my mind, it kept clear of some of the pitfalls of the genre, emerging as more than just a glorified episode of the series. The futuristic world was an interesting mix, but it stayed as a backdrop to the mystery rather than demanding attention. The story itself, as an investigation starting practically from scratch by the Cowboys, managed to avoid being predictable, even if it was not as suspenseful as intended. The different threads and incidents of the search varied from the philosophical to the humorous to brushes with death, but progressed at a manageable pace for casual viewers. The dialogue was not particularly riveting, falling flat as it tried to be profound, but I'm willing to chalk that up to translation and dubbing, something to be expected from anime.

Maybe then North America will start to realize that ""animated"" does not mean ""kids only""; that you can covey emotion as well as any other media.This isn't a ""cartoon"". This is a drama written for adults. For adults doesn't mean nudity (which there is none of). It just means that it was written to satisfy the adult mind. The story is about a terrorist, and those who are fighting against him. There is violence and death, just like in any other action movie about terrorism. Don't think you can show this to young children, because you can't.This isn't just a movie, it is animated Art for the eyes and for the mind.

The way they talk, move, look and interact makes this movie feel as real as anything with live actors.The music is top notch, and will be a purchase I shall eagerly seek out. It complements the moods of the movie, without interfering.In short, wow.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
95,bromanagro,One of the best Anime movies ever made!,10,25 December 2001,"I am a huge fan of Bebop and I think it is one of the top 5 best Anime series of all time. With that said, I will get on with my review, however, understand that because I love this series so much this is still an unbiased review based solely on the cinematic display. Ok?This movie is an amazing tribute to the greatness that is Cowboy Bebop. It has all the elements that make Bebop such a great series. Great animation, great sound effects, great voice actors and an amazing soundtrack. The animation is better then anything from the episodes. The CG effects look great and you will even forget you are watching animated sequences. Everything is animated realistically and it does not feel like you are watching some sort of rinky dinky cartoon.The music? As amazing as expected! How can anyone dispute Yoko Kanno? Yoko Kanno is a genius and she exemplifies excellence in the field of soundtracks to anime and is without a doubt the BEST in the biz! This movie featured great new music tracks that I can't wait to get in a cd or MP3 form. Her music sets and defines the tone in every scene in this movie just as it was in the regular series. You gotta hear these songs! I am a huge fan of Kanno and just like everyone of her other fans...I watch the anime fully anticipating her music. It's just that good.Anyway, this movie is full of great action and of course the story supports it all the way. The plot to this movie is one of the best if not better then any plot to any of the regular series episodes. All the pieces to the plot fit together neatly and even though you might not understand certain aspects the first time, later on you will fully comprehend why those things occurred. It all fits together nicely in the end. This movie was more plot driven then anything and the action fits in nicely so the spacing and direction all work perfectly.I don't want to give away any plot details. But I can't complete this review without explaining why I think it will be a long time before we see an American dub of this movie for the States to have. I think it will be at least a year before we get a dub of this in the States. Waiting will be the toughest part. But, it will be well worth it. You will love this movie even if you are not a Bebop fan. Any fan of animation in general will fully appreciate everything about this film. If you are a Bebop fan, this movie is a dream come true.Current worldly events is a big reason as to why it will be a while for this to reach the States, unfortunately.  So, I will label the next part of this review as a *spoiler* and I will get into some specific plot details as to why I think this eerily mirrors current unfortunate events. So, if you do not want to be *spoiled* then please STOP reading this review and go about your business. Thank you for your time. Otherwise...
*SPOILERS**This movie has to do with terrorism. Biological terrorism specifically. However, there are certain events in this movie that can allude certain viewers to the events of 9/11 and others, unfortunately.Examples include: The bio terrorism aspect can remind people of the Anthrax related events that occurred recently in the United States. In the first critical scene, there is a large explosion at the base of a building and it causes havoc in the streets and all over news wires. The main villain (a bio terrorist), is also a former war veteran, looks like someone from the Arabian world and even has his own sick and twisted delusions of grandeur. This terrorist also gets the largest bounty-ever placed on his head. Sound familiar? So this character can be alluded to as a 'Bin Laden' type figure. Also, Spike (the main protagonist) scours an area for clues known as 'Little Morocco', which is a small village that is similar to some place in the Arabian world. Spike even befriends an Arabian-type person for clues. With all this said, there is one specific scene in this film that really stands out in my mind as to why I think it will never be shown for a while. In fact, this specific scene may be deleted for later dubs. This one scene involves the appearance of two large twin towers that look very similar to the WTC. In fact, the artist probably intended these two towers to be the WTC of this Bebop universe, that is how eerily similar they look. It also appears at a very depressing time for our protagonist, Spike, too. It's only a short scene and it can easily be removed so I would not be shocked to see it gone in any future dubs. There are possibly a few other drastic current event related items in here but feel free to e-mail me if you want to discuss them or any other Bebop related items.*END OF SPOILERS*Peace",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie

I really enjoy series like Outlaw Star, The Big O or the Gundam series. I went to see this movie with my wife who is definitely not an Anime Fan and we both really enjoyed it.If you like anime series or a good action pic, see this movie. It is both exciting and funny. It is written on an adult level with excellent voice characterizations by the same cast as the English TV version. Too bad its only in narrow release. It makes Final Fantasy look like puke.April 2008 Addendum:I watched this movie on DVD and I still think it is the bomb.

97,lleshf,The Greatest Anime Movie Ever for the Greatest Anime Series Ever.,10,19 June 2002,"This movie was so perfect that it was almost too good to be true. If you are a fan of the Anime, you will LOVE this series. The Anime is without a doubt, the greatest animated series of all time. Everything else is far inferior compared to the greatness that is Cowboy BeBop. So I remember seeing this movie months ago and I set my expectations low because I didn't want to be that disappointed. Boy was I amazed at what I saw! I loved every bit, every aspect of this film. Once again, the Great Watanabe ,Nobumoto and co. have amazed the world of Otaku lovers with this work of sheer brilliance. Amazing production, amazing quality and I just love these people! Oh and I love Bandai, Sotsu, Sunrise. The music in this was astounding, as expected from the super-talented Yoko Kanno. She is in her own domain of musical excellence. The tracks were amazing, and contrary to what a previous reviewer has stated, the opener to this movie is so hip, funky and jazzy that you will want a copy of it and all the other amazing tracks featured in this film. The entire crew did an amazing job! The main characters that we all love, were treated with grace, dignity and were all handled beautifully. We were even treated to new characters that revealed themselves to be very deep and realistic.  The script was amazing, so humane and real and yet often at times gush of sheer 'poetry'. The action sequences were a treat and are unforgettable. The animation in this is far superior to that of the series and are so groundbreaking that I feel that no hand-to-hand combat scenes or arial fight scenes have EVER been animated with this sort of amazing quality and sheer realism. They are sight to behold. Again, the crew responsible in this did an amazing job! I can't praise the creators of this enough! As far as the plot, everything seems to flow together smoothly and just as the series, at times, is almost 'artsy' in terms of momentum shifts and 'high and low periods' where everything just seems to fit in perfectly and make perfect sense. Folks, this film is a product that far surpasses anything Hollywood has given us in terms of this genre (non-animated even) for the passed 20 years. This far exceeds anything in terms of entertainment for that time period, IMHO. Granted, the characters and source material was so good that nobody could have ultimately 'messed up' a Cowboy BeBop movie. But still, this movie far exceeded mine and others expectations. When you read all these reviews you must realize that they are not all completely wrong. This movie is very very good, at the very least. Now, I see that some of the later reviewers were more critical of this then they were praising of it. Now, that is just silly, IMHO. I think these reviewers were so overanalyzed this thing to death, that they were only looking for what may be the slightest 'wrong thing' in this movie and decided to expound on them in their reviews. Don't take the very critical critics in here too seriously. These people probably have seen this thing 5 times straight and then after the 6th viewing decided one morning that this movie was not as good as they originally thought it was. This movie is so close to perfect that it would take the most anal of critics or the most yuppy of coffee drinking critics to find something even slightly wrong with this work of art. So, in other words, the critical ones on here are reading too into this and think that this is some sort of arthouse project that must contain some sort of hidden message that reveals the 'secret of life' or something.In conclusion, if you are true BeBop fan, you will absolutely LOVE this movie to no end! If you are not a BeBop fan (as if those even exist) but love anime, you will still find this movie to be utterly amazing. If you do not appreciate any animated films whatsoever, you will still find this movie to be the 'exception' for it will be far superior to anything you have ever seen in years (non-animated wise). This movie was excellent in every aspect and is truly memorable in every way.Bottom line, see this movie and prepare to be entertained.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
98,henry-mikitish,Knockin' in the Wrong Places,6,20 July 2011,"I can only look at this movie in one way: in the view of a Bebop enthusiast. In truth, I was disappointed by the movie, and for a number of reasons. Let's look at the bad first:1. Spike doesn't act in character. When ever in the TV show is he getting on random women? I mean, he never does jack crap with Faye; and I find the following even weirder, that he explicitly says in the movie that (random woman) is like ""strong,"" and all this horsey bologna, when in the show he says (even more explicitly) that he doesn't like women with attitudes (Faye). Yet there he is, hitting on a girl with a gun who's trying to shoot him full of holes. Why? Don't know. According to the director, Spike acts oppositely towards the people he likes (always giving Jet the finger in the show, never liking Faye, hating on Ed and the Dog when he obviously cares about them)... Why is this woman (Electra von Random Boobs) even there? She should have been replaced with a female lead we give two s***s about, in other words, Faye. If they wanted to work romance into the show, this *feature length* movie could have TOTALLY brewed a little something more than NOTHING between Spike and Faye. I mean, Goodness Mary Moses! Sure, I said Spike ""doesn't like girls with attitudes,"" but here's the catch: Faye's been around him a long time--enough time to make a serious relationship. This woman pops up randomly--out of nowhere! When Faye popped up out of nowhere, Spike didn't get all ""hey baby"" with her, and both of the women were swinging guns around. Besides, Faye is way hotter than (random woman made for the movie). (Random lady) wasn't even well developed as a character. Who wants to see her? No one. Enough said. 2. Lost feel of what makes Bebop what it is. There were no blues jams (barely), and there was not a single shot of outer space (unless it was in the beginning out a window, or something, or on a computer screen). There was no classic Bebop feel of ""Bounty Hunters,"" except for in the very beginning at the convenience store. That was the high part of the movie for me. 3. Off the last note, I have a Chicken Bone to pick with the music (only the Bebop masters will catch that one!). Where was the good music? Where was ""Tank!""? Not in this movie! 4. Filled with silly mumbo jumbo. I don't care about this whole ""knockin' on heaven's"" door stuff. It wasn't even well portrayed. To be honest, mumbo jumbo doesn't work for me unless it's one: NOT an action movie, TWO, a TV series where it can spread out, or THREE, actually good mumbo jumbo, that really, REALLY makes you think (Inception). Besides, the whole message was gobbled, forced, and abominable. I can barely describe it, it was so f***ed up. 5. Plot. Nano creatures in lymph cells, zzz I didn't know this was Discovery Health. C'mon, let's follow a wild crook through space, get lost among the stars, meet an alien life form! We've seen the whole super soldiers on Titan stuff before, and it's not getting any better the more they dust it off and throw back in the plot. Unlike crime fights, space, and bounty hunting, Titan plots about viruses are not what Bebop's about. Leave the viruses to Dr. House. 6. Putting the bad dude in a halfway respectable light was just... bad. And there's Spike, chatting with him at the end. What's up with that? He has the same voice as Vicious, too, which really blew my mind. His incessant chatter about BS was also dumb, but I already went through how bad the mumbo jumbo was. The ideal bad dude: did the same creepy stuff with Faye but maybe go a bit farther, and then Spike totally whips his ass. That would have been satisfying. 7. With the computer theme, I think Ed should have done more hacking, like she was known for when she first appeared. She's supposed to be the Godchild of this stuff! 8. Not enough Faye. That other (random pair of tits) should have not been in the movie. I was really hoping this movie would get some Spike/Faye going on. Some might then say, ""How would it fit chronologically?"" Dude, I never said they needed to get married. There should just be some romantic tension that basically returns to normal by the end. Easy peasy lemon squeezy. Did I say this already? Yes, I did, but it's the part that most annoyed me.The Good? 1. If you sleep through the boring debriefings and the main villain's lame monologues, the action scenes are quite good, at least animation-wise. I think there should have been a bit more group Bebop action, Faye, Jet, and Spike back-to-back, blowing down the baddies. Wait here I am going on again about what it SHOULD have been. 2. I laughed three times.Bottom line: It was a decent watch. I shouldn't have come with such high expectations, but it's hard not to when it's attached to my favorite series of all-time. So disappointed that there was no Faye-Spike stuff Such a drag. Ugh Julia. Ugh (Random Tits).",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
99,helltobb,Cowboy Bebop: The Movie,10,15 October 2005,"Set on Mars in the year 2071, COWBOY BEBOP: THE MOVIE is based on the much-loved animated television series by Japanese director Shinichiro Watanabe. (The show airs on the Cartoon Network in the U.S.) As the film begins, Spike (Steven Jay Blum) and his gang of gypsy vigilantes are roaming the city, looking for trouble when Faye (Wendee Lee) witnesses a bioterrorist attack. Hovering above the city in her spaceship, she sees a man fleeing the scene. Over 500 people die in the attack, and the city offers a monetary reward for any information. The gang jumps at the opportunity. They decide to branch out, each using their own tactics to research the tragedy. Spike slinks through Chinatown, being led by shady underground characters. Faye traces the image of the man she saw back to military files. And the young Ed (Mellisa Fahn) and her dog Ein do some handy computer research. Meanwhile Jet (Beau Billinglsea), holds down the fort, worried about the gang. When the criminal Vincent (Daran Norris), is identified, with a connection to Spike's love interest Elektra (Jennifer Hale), the real action begins. Cowboy Bebop: The Movie is a perfect example of flawless anime. I guess you'd have to expect the film to be perfect, considering the series was perfect itself.Perfect anime.

101,silentbob1000,Life chnging anime,10,24 February 2002,"Every so often you watch something that changes your out-look and your perception of film, media and sometimes even life. Cowboy Bebop changed me and had this profound effect on my life. As i wannabe film maker I fell in love with the style and the stories that Bebop was all about, and i know if I ever make it, my style will be clearly derived from this influence. So when the movie Knocking on Heavens door was released I was needless to say a little excited, and Shinichiro Watanabe didn't let me down. The film is not unlike watching an extended episode from the original series. You can see that the production value has increased, the animation is cleaner and more advanced. The story is good as does not cause any disprution to the original series as it is slotted in-between episode 22 and 23. Even if you have not seen any of the original episodes (fools) you can watch this film without confusion as it stands alone nicely. The music for the film is also provided by Yoko Kanno, (she does the music for the serise) only she could create such a great sound-track and get away with techno-opera, and the opening and closing songs are brilliant in there own ways. Gotta Knock A Little Harder, the last song has me in tears even when i just listen to it without the film. To conclude this film is an amazing piece of work, so forget what you think you know about Japanese anime and just admire the greatness of Bebop!",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie

Other than becoming an instant classic, this series has also help spread Anime into America(Which is a good thing)  This movie, takes place in between episodes 22 and 23, but if you haven't seen any of the episodes, don't worry, you will easily pick up on everything. The show starts off with the introduction of the main characters and then right away, jumps into the story.  I hate to tell you anything about the story for I feel, that if you go into not knowing much, you will come out even more excited.  The animation is top quality, also, the film itself would easily compare to any action movie put out in the summer.  Chances of this film going to all major theaters in America are very low, but if this is playing near you, go, SEE IT!!!

The show's unique music, strong animation, and brilliant writing made it a level above shows like similar Outlaw Star and Trigun.  The movie (which actually takes place DURING the series, not after) is essentially a long episode.  So, unless you've seen the series (or at least know what it's about) you'll quickly be lost.

I love the characters frm Bebop but they were for the most part unengauging in 'Heaven's'.  The best character was the purple haired chick who Spike meets.  Jet did 'jack', Ed was more annoying than usual, and all Faye did was give us the most insane tease  of her tits.  I could have done without all the boring buildup until the last 2 fight scenes.

109,kenshi,One of the Best Anime Movies Ever.,10,13 March 2003,"The Cowboy Bebop movie really stuck out as a movie in which I really liked. Given most anime movies tend to do poorly, with only a handful (including OVAs) faring well in reviews, Knocking on Heavens Door really performs well.The basic premise of the plot is quite simple.  A record breaking 300 million woolong bounty is offered on a bio-terrorist behind a virus attack. However, as Spike and his crew investigate further into the incident, Spike realizes that he and Vincent are not as far apart as they seem...
The story does not stray far from the basic plot line, which is good. Instead of heading off into different tangents and side storylines, the entire movie is focused on building up the main story behind Vincent Volaju and what will happen.  Even the minor side stories contribute small bits of information as well as help in plot progression.  The four main characters all play a role in the movie, as expected, and like the anime, most of the spotlight is on Spike.  Overall the storyline is easy to follow and comprehensive.  Yet there are themes and concepts which are quite thought invoking, examined thoroughly and as underlying themes in the story and plot.Animation wise, the quality is excellent.  Each movement is fluid and natural, with no attention spared to details.  As this is a movie as opposed to an OVA, there is no change in animation or character art style, aside from a general improvement in quality.  Definitely a plus.Typical to the anime, the soundtrack follows the same general jazz/bebop theme.  As with musical influences, one only needs to look at the movie title to see an obvious one.  However the number of tracks is not considered scarce by all accounts, but aside from themes such as ¡§Pushing the Sky,"" ""Powder"" or ""Cosmic Pretty,"" none of the OST really made a real impression on me.  Nonetheless the sound effects in the movie are done quite well, in sync and fitting the situation very well.All in all, this is one of the best Anime movies, if not, movies overall that I have seen.  With one of the memorable fight scenes ever in anime history as well as an excellent plot, Cowboy Bebop: Knocking on Heavens Door is highly recommended to everyone, and virtually required viewing for all anime and Cowboy Bebop fans.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie

This movie is up there with Bruce Lee and The Simpsons, the art was excellent, the storyline had meaning and kids and adults alike will enjoy this movie, just as Harry Potter, the film could've done with abit more advertising, no, ALOT more.

113,Alan_Gabriel,More than worthy of being associated with the series,10,17 August 2004,"This movie is just as good, if not better, than most of the episodes in the series. If Bebop fans learn to accept the story for what it is--an extended version of a typical(albeit superior) episode, this movie will live up to the exceptional quality of the series. And if someone with no knowledge of the series watches this movie, they will have very little to catch up on. The great thing about the film is its accessibility to all audiences with its stand alone storyline(although Bebop fans can still get new things out of it).With the introduction of the character of Vincent Volaju, the Cowboy Bebop brain trust has provided a great nemesis for the protagonist Spike to interact with. These two characters' fight scenes are exceptional, and the bond that they share works great with the overall tone of the series. The subtle philosophical points of the film may not be mind blowing, but they are definitely above average. Great dialogue is rare in animation, let alone anime, and this is one of the strong points of both the series and the movie. It is obvious that the creators have tried to fit almost all elements of the series into this work, and they have succeeded, despite that great burden. Each of the five major characters from the series(Spike, Jet, Faye, Ed, and Ein) get the right amount of time in the spotlight, while allowing the new characters(Vincent, Electra, and Rashid) time to develop properly. Also, as any fan of the series can vouch for, the music is not only original, but almost like a character unto itself.Ultimately, this film boils down to the centerpiece of the series, Spike Spiegel, and his final meeting with his kindred spirit, the tortured Vincent Volaju. The result of this film helps propel the series into its heart wrenching conclusion and underlying philosophical tone. More than worthy of being associated with the Cowboy Bebop series.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie

If this is what i can expect to see from the series i would think that i am in for a treat. The plot while leaving a few questions unexplained, such as why would the man killing everyone but himself help him, is still attention grabbing and clever. The characters, while familiar to those who have seen the cartoon series, are entertaining even to those who have not so the appearance of new characters made no difference to me.

I'm not saying it is fully realistic, just that it is more realistic than most animes. The characters, they're perfectly created their attitudes intertwine perfectly with each others'. They have more depth than some unanimated movies I have seen. The movie also keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time, not a disappointment to the series in its entirety. As for the people that do not like Anime, they like Cowboy Bebop, showing it is the acme of anime. Although the series was short it was one of the greatest series, not only were the characters meticulously detailed but the story line had every aspect needed to make it good. Any one who thinks Cowboy Bebop is just any other anime, they are utterly wrong. Great movie and series I recommend it to any one ages 14 and older, and those below that age that know the difference between what is right and wrong. The movie also shows different cultures, which is not shown in many other animes which only adds to its greatness.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie

About the blue color an then yellow again of spike shirt, there are different versions i already have one with that error and other is corrected maybe or is more original than the other don't know i like to believe that the original does not have that minimal error, the other observations about mistakes are without sense and no need to say anything about them. do they think something is not moving when you are not seeing it!! i mean Faye flying at start. really like i use to say: people is just bad milk! the same wrong info is said about matrix, they just don't understand it. i am glad to write this here knowing very much people will read it. i always like to give my opinion about great arts and great creations. i am participating in one so.. thanks IMDb. one last note!always look it in Japanese if is Japanese made! no other.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
117,Ostrakon85,Excellent,10,7 April 2005,"If you've seen the series, and liked it you'll love the movie. Set somewhere between episodes 22 and 23 (or 23 and 24) this story follows the normal path of each episode of bebop, but the story is longer and more involved. Since there is no real flow of a true storyline between the episodes, you wouldn't be lost without seeing the whole series, but you might want to check out the first few so you're not lost in the beginning with the characters. When I saw it I had already seen the series through twice, and each time I seem to pick up certain things that i missed before. With the movie, I've only seen it once, but would have no problem watching it over and over again. I guarantee if you are a fan of bebop, or anime at all, this is a great film for you.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
118,trunkslamchest,A Missed Opportunity,5,9 February 2017,"I created this account to write this review.I have been a big fan of Cowboy Bebop since I first watched it back in 2006. I am not a fan of anime, but Cowboy Bebop is the only anime that breaks that boundary for me with it's fantastic retro-futurism, dark undertones and deep character development. My first attempt at watching the Cowboy Bebop Movie came about 4 years ago. I got roughly 30 minutes into it and turned it off because of how unnatural it all felt. The music felt wrong, characters felt wooden...It reminded me of the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 movie...they did it because they had to/knew they would make a lot of money off it. It left a very sour taste in my mouth, although it did not affect my pure love and passion for the TV Series. The TV Series is a SOLID 9/10, and could only be improved upon if they had extended the series a few more episodes. The TV Series is as close to perfect as you can get.Flash forward to this morning. I decided to continue my ritual of watching Cowboy Bebop once a month and decided, ""Lets give the movie another shot."" So as a fan who is still loves the TV series, my opinions will be based upon the movie's comparison to the TV Series rather than how a casual fan or how the average movie go-er might review the film. PROS: 1. The scenery and cinematography is amazing, as it is with the TV series. Backdrops are breathtaking, animation is top notch, action scenes are fluid and phenomenally choreographed. 2. More Cowboy Bebop.CONS: 1. Copy & Pasted Plot: The movie's story line and plot devices are basically cut and pasted from different episodes of the TV series. More specifically: Session 4 (plot to save a planet from biological terrorism), Session 6 (unkillable villain finally dies and has revelations about his assumed immortality), Session 19 (use of old air/spacecraft to save the day), Session 20 (fight scenes on a train), and Session 23 (the real villain uses a decoy to mask his identity...actually there are a handful of sessions that do this). There are a lot more examples but these are just a few off the top of my head. Vicious is basically Vincent, and Electra is basically Julia. Spike & Friends go from low life bounty hunters to unsung heroes of the solar system with the flip of a switch because ""its the right thing to do."" a major theme of the TV series is hopelessness. there is no hopelessness in the movie.2. Spike's love interest in Electra: No. Just...No. Spike Loves Julia. Spike has always loved Julia. I love Julia. Spike only lets Julia go after Session 26, because she dead. The movie takes place between session 22 & 23. Julia is not dead yet. Spike is still searching for Julia. WHAT THE ****?3. Poorly Executed Ending: I said to myself ""this is a 7/10"" all the way up to the last 20 minutes. Pisswater Ex-Machina. Faye magically breaks into a massive weather control station with an Uzi and just demands they make it rain. Jet magically summons a fleet of biplanes in like an hour, even though the crew of the bebop is constantly poor and would have no way to pay for the rental costs since they can barely pay for fuel and food. Vincent dies, reveals he and Electra used to bang, butterflies circle in (Butterflies are this movies John Woo white doves), Jet and Faye have an awkward conversation...and roll credits. It was like a train-wreck, except the train kinda just went off the tracks a little and slid into an open field, rather than slamming into an oncoming train.5. Unnatural Personalities: Edward and Ein were the only two main characters that felt authentic. Faye acted like a high school girl with a gun, not a strong woman who trusts no one and has had to look over her shoulder her entire life. Jet acts like a dad, instead of a hardened ex-cop who doesn't want to admit his feelings for his crew members, but passive aggressively does through his actions. Spike lacks the apathetic wit and clever edginess that makes him so lovable in the TV Series. In the movie, he kind of just comes off as a d-bag.6. Singular Setting: The entire movie takes place on Mars. There is no space. There are no other planets or space stations. The TV Series built an entire solar system of locations filled with lore and mystery that could surely have been expanded upon in the movie. Why the does the entire cowboy bebop movie take place on 1 planet? not just 1 planet, but 1 city on 1 planet. there are multiple cities on Mars, yet no mention of them in the movie. They act like Alba City is the only settlement on Mars. WHAT THE ****?I can keep going and going and going but....1000 word maximum.Am I saying the cowboy bebop movie is bad? no. Am I saying you shouldn't watch it? No. Maybe my disappointment comes from the movie's clear disconnection from the TV series, but as a long time fan of the TV Series, I simply had to vent my utter disappointment with the movie....somewhere.",Cowboy Bebop - The Movie
