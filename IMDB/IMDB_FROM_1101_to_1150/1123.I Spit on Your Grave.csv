0,Leofwine_draca,A horrible movie,5,28 January 2014,"Ever watch a movie that you wish you could un-watch afterwards? That's the case with this needless remake of I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, which is just a horrible, mean-spirited and vicious movie all around. Admittedly the film starts off well on a subtle level, but by the time of the protracted rape sequence I was ready to turn it off. Then the second half features some torture porn-style revenge which leaves an equally foul taste in the mouth.It's hard to know why this film was made, except to shock. The production values are actually pretty decent, and it's also fairly hard to fault the acting of the small cast, all of whom are giving worthwhile performances. The various bloodthirsty special effects are all realistic, and the direction is passable. But the subject matter is so hostile, so obscene, so disturbing, that I can't imagine anyone procuring entertainment value from such a movie. Once watched I was glad to get rid of it.",I Spit on Your Grave
1,SnoopyStyle,I rather follow the girl after the escape,5,2 December 2014,"Jennifer Hills (Sarah Butler) rents an isolated cabin from Earl (Tracey Walter) to spends some quiet time writing her novel. At the gas station, she catches the attention of Johnny Miller (Jeff Branson) and his two friends Stanley (Daniel Franzese) and Andy (Rodney Eastman). Stanley stalks Jennifer with his camera. Mentally challenged Matthew (Chad Lindberg) comes to fix her toilet. The three guys grab Matthew along to rape her. She manages to escape and find safety with Sheriff Storch (Andrew Howard) but it's only the beginning.This starts out competently as a formulaic slasher movie. The rape scene is harsh especially with the cop. It's a disturbing reasonable start for a shock horror. The guys could be more threatening but they are more like frat boys instead of Deliverance. I didn't really like the cop's 'plan'. It has too many loose ends right from the start. I really don't like what happens after Jennifer escapes. I rather follow her than the men. It becomes a bunch of nothing special torture kills. The movie could have done a twist like Matthew taking on Jennifer's persona or if it's actually Jennifer's ghost. I'm fine that neither was used but then I want to see how Jennifer in the woods prepare her revenge. That's way more interesting to me then the idiot guys.",I Spit on Your Grave
2,claudio_carvalho,Deadly Revenge,4,14 August 2011,"The writer Jennifer Hills (Sarah Butler) rents an isolated lakeside cabin in the woods of the peaceful Mockingbird Trail for two months to write a novel. Two days later, she is brutally gang raped by three local bigoted rednecks from a gas station, the sheriff and one retarded handyman. Jennifer vanishes and is presumed dead; however she returns later to revenge against the rapists.""I Spit on Your Grave"" is a poor remake of the brutal 1978 cult ""Day of the Woman"". The original film is extremely realistic and violent; therefore the simple and scary story is absolutely credible. The unknown Camille Keaton has an amazing performance, especially in the impressive long sequence when she is repeatedly beaten and raped, giving the sensation that she is really raped in the filming.This remake is also brutal, but cannot be compared with the original film. The modifications do not develop characters and situations like in the ""Day of the Woman"" and introduce a deranged sheriff. I do not understand why someone could produce and direct a remake of such violent and sick story of rape and revenge. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Doce Vingança"" (""Sweet Revenge"")",I Spit on Your Grave
3,nogodnomasters,OVERRATED REVENGE REMAKE,5,8 May 2019,"This is a remake of the old 1980's rape genre films for sick people. The plots are basically the same. A woman is raped. Woman gets revenge. Sometimes it is an abduction or a home invasion, or in this case, a woman is taken in her cabin by a bunch of rednecks. As compared to the original, the nudity was less in the remake and the rape scene less graphic. There I said it.Oh yes, the characters are more developed and the torture inflicted by the woman is a tad better, but is that why people watch rape films, for character? The same could be said for the remake of ""Last House on the Left,"" they watered down the rape and nudity. I can't believe with all these silicon soft core stars, they could not have picked something with more eye candy for the starring role instead of someone who can act.Decent folks will want to stay away from this movie. Sickos would be better off with the original or a David Hess film festival.",I Spit on Your Grave
4,kosmasp,Holding back/together,5,7 November 2010,"I have not seen the Original movie, so I cannot comment how true it is to that. But it does not pull any punches (or anything else for that matter, forgive the pun). The movie does work for it's actors. For the viewer to go through such an ordeal the actors have to be convincing and really good. And though I do not like to watch the things happening in here (especially if a movie is advertised sensationally and almost seems to exist for the sole purpose to ""entertain"" us with disgusting things) the main actress (though she has not been in many things) and Andrew Garfield carry the movie.There are character beats and illogical things, such as almost the complete end. Let's say that some things should have been better thought of. But then again, with a movie like this, it's not so much about thinking, but about reacting and bringing forth primal instincts (on both sides). Of course it does not get philosophical, but it does have that edge, if you wanna see it.",I Spit on Your Grave
5,Sleepin_Dragon,Beats the original.,8,20 May 2019,"It's not often that I'll favourably compare a remake to the original, but in this instance, I must. I thought the original was a pretty bad film, undoubtedly shocking, and deserving of its infamous name, but the remake I feel captures the essence of the revenge, and desperation of the victim to get her own back.It is of course shocking, and at times is quite sickening to watch, there were plenty of moments when I had to look away, but you can't help but feel a sense of justice as the tables get turned.Very nicely produced, and well acted. A remake I know, but worthy of being deemed something of a horror classic, one to give you a fear of Ravens for life. 8/10",I Spit on Your Grave
6,gavin6942,"A Weak, Toothless Remake of a Cult Classic",6,11 January 2011,"A young woman goes to a cabin in the woods in order to write a novel. Unfortunately, the locals do not think highly of young, unprotected women and she soon becomes their victim. Is this the end, or only just the beginning? Some have praised this version of ""I Spit on Your Grave"" as superior to Meir Zarchi's original film. I could not disagree more. This version is weak, far less stunning, and borders on the ""torture porn"" trend of the last decade that I thought -- incorrectly, apparently -- was dying.Some changes were made, such as updating technology and adding in a police man. But it was a very cliché addition, and the only aspect that makes it an improvement at all is because the officer has a daughter. The rest of it is just one-dimensional fluff.The nudity and rape scenes are toned down dramatically. Some have said the original pushed it too far, but that was the point: violence is not real when it is entertainment. It should horrify, shock and sicken you. This film shortens and weakened the rape sequences, making it more of a gimmick than a real shocker.From there, the film becomes ""torture porn"" -- how can we burn, chop, mutilate the men as badly as possible? It far exceeds the first film. And unlike the original's use of sex to lure the men to their doom (a clever turnaround), here it is just raw violence.I suppose the sound and picture quality are improved due to a decent budget and modern technology, but it is just a disposable film. I will go on pretending the remake never happened, because it is the ultimate disappointment. One more weak plot with weak characters, a remake that does not honor the original in any way or try to improve upon it.",I Spit on Your Grave
7,jboothmillard,I Spit on Your Grave,5,18 February 2011,"The 1978 controversial cult classic seemingly straight to video original is okay, I had a feeling that this remake would be terrible and a waste of time, but I was actually pleasantly surprised. Basically Jennifer Hill (Sarah Butler) has rented a cabin in the woods, somewhere in the deep south, in order to write a new novel, and on the way she encounters three guys while asking for directions at the gas station. She arrives at the cabin, and gets started on her new novel, she hears strange noises in the night, and then she is forced to get handyman Matthew (Chad Lindberg), a simple and quite retarded individual, to fix her plumbing. Then the next night she gets a visit from the three guys at the gas station, Johnny (Jeff Branson), Stanley (Daniel Franzese) and Andy (Rodney Eastman), and of course Matthew who told them about her, it is obvious that he may fancy her, and slowly they try to take advantage. They start assaulting her, and she manages to smash one of them on the head and run out, bumping into police sheriff Storch (Andrew Howard), but it turns out he is in on this attack on her as well. While Matthew refuses to have sex with her when they rip her clothes off, one by one they take advantage and rape her instead, until eventually Matthew does his business too. Limping away they planned to shoot Jennifer dead, but she instead jumps off the edge of the bridge falling into the water, but there is no sign of a body, they assume she is dead from drowning. A month or so later however their evil actions come back to haunt them, she is still alive, having lived on, apparently, eating bugs and stuff, and she is playing mind games on them, including giving them the tape from the camera one of them filmed the rape on. Matthew however is the first to actually see Jennifer, and knowing she is enraged he sobs for forgiveness, she plays like she is accepting it, but all she does is drag him with a rope by the neck, choking him. Next, Stanley steps into a bear trap, is tied with tape to a tree and has his eye lids forced open by fish hooks in them, so that he can be killed by having his eyes pecked out by birds. Then, Jennifer knocks Andy out with a baseball bat, ties him with some boards above a bath tub filling with water, for which she puts some lye, an acid like liquid, in it, and removing the board supporting his head he slowly dunks his head in and out, melting his face off. Group leader Johnny is next victim, he is also knocked out, strung up naked in a room with a ball gag in his mouth, she pulls his teeth out (as he was keen on her's), before finally getting some shears (hedge clippers) to cut off his cock, and let him bleed to death. Lastly, the sheriff, who has a pregnant wife and young daughter, is the final one to face the revenge of Jennifer, he is tied up with a shotgun rammed up his arse, and the trigger activated by the movement of a still living but unconscious Matthew will fire it, killing them both, it does and it ends with Jennifer evilly smirking. Also starring Tracey Walter as Earl and Mollie Milligan as Mrs. Storch. Butler is acting much more than the low budget version's original actress, and the actors playing the rapists do their parts well also, I was quite impressed by how much more violent this version was. If you've seen Saw or Hostel you'll be aware of the similar ""torture porn"" quality, people who have seen the original and the critics may not agree, but I personally say that this is actually a much more improved film, a good horror. Worth watching!",I Spit on Your Grave
8,BA_Harrison,A bold remake.,8,9 May 2011,"For years, a remake of I Spit On Your Grave was virtually unthinkable, such was the moral majority's revulsion at the original's harrowing rape scenes and brutal acts of revenge (Roger Ebert called the film 'an expression of the most diseased and perverted darker human natures'). The 21st century, however, has not only seen horror movie-makers successfully pushing the boundaries of the genre further than ever before, but also remaking virtually every classic horror movie of the 70s and 80s in the process. With the equally controversial rape/revenge classic The Last House On the Left' getting the remake treatment in 2009, it was only a matter of time before 'I Spit' followed suit...Directed by Steven R. Monroe, who must possess a set of brass balls the size of Jupiter to tackle such a project, and starring the equally courageous actress Sarah Butler, whose demanding role requires her to get naked from the waist down in order to suffer her gruelling on-screen ordeal, I Spit On Your Grave (2010) is an intense, raw and uncompromising experience that goes all out to surpass the nastiness of the original, and which often succeeds in doing so.Certainly, as far as the bloodthirsty acts of revenge are concerned, this version is much harsher: with a shed full of wickedly sharp tools and corrosive substances at her disposal, Butler's character, novelist Jennifer Hills, can get very creative in order to get even, and once she lays her hands on a shotgun... well, you'll have to watch to find out, but take it from me, it ain't pleasant!!! This effective remake also benefits from a thoughtful, well written script that expands on the original's basic story, adding a cool new character in the form of a scurrilous hick sheriff, whilst doing away with some of the original's more questionable aspects, most notably Jennifer's seduction of her attackers.I rate 'I Spit On Your Grave' (2010) a very respectable 8/10, which is the same as I gave the 1978 version; that said, if I HAD to choose between the two, I would go for the original, because of its genuinely gritty 70s vibe, its more harrowing rape sequence (Camille Keaton's torment goes on for what seems like an eternity), but most of all for simply being such an iconic piece of exploitation cinema (oh, and the full colour 1978 poster is better too!).",I Spit on Your Grave
9,paul_haakonsen,Wonderfully brutal and straight to the point...,8,18 September 2011,"I recall having seen the 1978 version a long, long time ago, but must confess that I can only recall parts of the movie. So I decided to give this 2010 remake version a go, without having any hopes or expectations to it.Wow! This movie was wicked. And in more than just one way. The story was compelling, even though it was twisted and perverse. But the movie just sweeps you up and takes you along for a ride, and you want to stick around and see what happens next. Basically, the story is about a young writer named Jennifer, who goes to a small town to write, and she is assaulted and tormented by a group of locals. Leaving her for dead, Jennifer comes back and takes revenge on those who wronged her.The ""I Spit On Your Grave"" 2010 remake had me nailed to the chair, especially because it was so brutal. This movie is definitely not for the faint hearted or for those easily offended. I was cringing several times throughout the movie and was curling in the chair in phantom pains as well. The way the brutal scenes were executed and portrayed was just off the charts. It was in a weird way, perfect brutality caught on film. Sounds bad to say, I know, but trust me, watch the movie and you will know what I am talking about. It was like you were right there in the movie yourself.Most of the people cast for the movie was new faces for me, I think I only recognized a single face, and he didn't even have a big role, that being Tracey Walter (playing Earl). Sarah Butler did a good job with the role of Jennifer, and she really came off quite believable. And credit is due the guys playing the tormentors as well, because they did good job with their roles as well (despite it being the roles of perverse deviants).""I Spit On Your Grave"" really surprised me and left me wanting for more. I actually want to sit down and watch the 1978 movie again to freshen up my memory of that version and compare it to this 2010 version.Normally I am not keen on Hollywood remakes of older movies, but this one really hit the nail straight on the head, and as the nail tore through the flesh, you will cringe, groan and want for more.There wasn't much music throughout the movie, or perhaps I just failed to notice it, because I was so caught up in the movie. But ""I Spit On Your Grave"" doesn't really need a hyped up score to work, because the story is selling (and telling) itself.The effects in the movie were good as well, though there wasn't an extraordinary amount of effects. But the effects that were used worked superbly and were straight to the point, showing and telling what needed to be portrayed. The movie has just the right amount of blood, guts and gore without turning into a splatterfest.If you haven't already gotten around to seeing this 2010 remake, then get yourself into gear and sit down to watch it. You will be in for quite an experience. But be warned; this movie is brutal. ""I Spit On Your Grave"" is definitely a movie that I will be popping into the DVD player again sometime in the future. It was wickedly awesome!",I Spit on Your Grave
10,Coventry,No More Miss Nice Girl,7,15 November 2011,"It's very popular to ""hate"" the nowadays trend of horror movie remakes, but you always have to bear two things in mind. 1) If we would collectively stop watching them, Hollywood wouldn't make them anymore and 2) there exist some remakes that are truly worth watching even though they still can't hold a candle to the original. Steven R. Monroe's update of the one of the most notorious cult movies ever made is such a remake. Meir Zarchi's original is a bona fide cult monument. You either love or hate it, but you can't deny it's a powerfully shocking and unforgettable film. The remake is perhaps not as memorable, but it definitely does contain a few sequences that are extremely brutal and hard to digest. Especially in comparison to the remake of that other notorious 70's classic – ""Last House on the Left"", which is rather soft and intended for wider audiences – this film is exclusively meant for experienced horror fanatics with a strong stomach and nerves of steel. The plot is commonly known, I presume. Jennifer, a young writer in search of inspiration for her second novel, withdraws herself to a remote cabin in the Louisianan backwoods area. Upon her arrival, she immediately draws the attention of the local ""tough"" guys working at the gas station as well as from the mentally handicapped handyman Matthew. Few days later, Jennifer gets humiliated and brutally gang-raped by the four men and even a local authority figure. What follows is her hardcore-to-the-bone vengeance, clearly executed with a deep hatred and zero morality whatsoever. The ""I spit on your Grave"" remake blends the raw atmosphere of the original with the more modern horror trend of torture-porn. The revenge that Sarah has prepared for her assailants are carefully planned and imaginative death traps to assure a maximum of agony. Some of the death sequences, like for example the acid bathtub or the eye-picking, would even make the Jigsaw killer of ""Saw"" jealous. Sarah Butler makes a strong impression in her role as not-so-vulnerable young girl and it's definitely a courageous performance. I hope she'll still find other roles without forever being known as the ""I Spit on your Grave"" girl. The rapists, on the other hand, are not as repulsive as they ought to be. Their performances aren't too memorable either, with the exception of Andrew Howard as the rotten sheriff. His whole character is a nice addition to Zarchi's original script, as a matter of fact.",I Spit on Your Grave
11,hitchcockthelegend,Uncomfortable material but worthy to the horror faithful.,7,23 February 2011,"I Spit on Your Grave is directed by Steven R. Monroe and written by Jeffrey Reddick. It stars Sarah Butler, Chad Lindberg, Daniel Franzese , Rodney Eastman, Jeff Branson & Andrew Howard. It is a remake of the 1978 film of the same name. Plot finds Butler as Jennifer, a writer who retreats to an idyllic beauty spot known as Mockingbird Trail to write her second novel. But her life is shattered when she is brutally gang raped and left for dead by a group of locals. But the men may just rue the day they set about this particular woman.OK, there are some fans of the original film out there, where it has enough support to have it listed as a horror cult classic of sorts. It isn't remotely a good film, whether it's judged as feminist wish fulfillment or a grimy gorno exercise in censor baiting, fact remains it's badly acted, badly directed and just leaves a nasty taste in the mouth. Monroe's remake, and lets face it in this day and age of gorno and torture porn excess the film was ripe for a re-imaging, is a film of two tonally differing halves. Two halves that while not making a satisfactory whole, do make for an attention grabbing-squirm inducing-viewing. The unease remains, I mean how can it not with gang rape and revenge fuelled torture as its centre pieces? But it's competently acted, especially by Butler who gives a bold show in a challenging role, and for those who like blood letting grue; the film in its last third delivers by the bucket load. Directing wise, Monroe is guilty of letting the build up drag too long, and even tho the pay off is worth the wait (you go girl), taking its lead from the Saw/Cube movies lacks invention and almost steals what freshness the film had to offer.It will find an audience for sure, while it's equally going to find enemies in critical and PC correctional quarters. But for a horror movie of this time it does its job well, and as remakes of older horrors go it's one of the better ones: surpassing the original by some margin too. 7/10",I Spit on Your Grave
12,Theo Robertson,Violent Restraint Even If It's Not Entirely Convincing,6,14 September 2013,"This is a remake of the infamous 1978 film which was the holy grail of video nasties in the early 1980s . Legendary American film critic Roger Ebert is on record as saying the original was the worst film he's ever seen and it's not often I disagree with Ebert and I think he got that one right . The 1978 fails to work on any level , not even as rape porn and let's ignore the people who claim the original was an exploration of both realist cinema and as violence against women - it was pure exploitation at its most unwatchable and nothing more . Having a remake seems like a strange idea . Certainly from a production value point of view it couldn't be worse but it's kind of like multiplying zero by a million times , you won't end up with a million , you will merely end up with zero In its favour this remake does have good production values . You weren't expecting it to be a contender for best editing or best cinematography at the Oscars but the technical values are more than adequate . What director Steven R Monroe does deserve congratulations for is making the pivotal scenes of sexual abuse and rape very restrained . Often the camera cuts away as Jennifer Hills is beaten and raped by the rural rednecks and it's left to the audience to fill in the gaps as to what type of brutal treatment she is receiving at the unfeeling hands of her captors . Often what you hear off screen is more disturbing as to what you see on screen Where the film falls down is it's difficult to believe Jennifer Hills as played by Sarah Butler would be physically able to manhandle her victims . Ms Butler is of a rather petite build and the men she wreaks vengeance mostly seem to be twice her size and twice her weight . The film is also nothing more than torture porn with a very simplistic story . Despite somewhat superior than to others in the genre - and indeed superior to the original - it's a film that would have probably been ignored if it wasn't for the notoriety of the original",I Spit on Your Grave
13,Scarecrow-88,I Spit on Your Grave,8,16 March 2011,"What's a pretty little thing like you doing out here all alone.It's the perfect nightmare scenario for pretty young women—to be in the middle of some rural backwoods area all alone where your friends and family are far from sight, rescue doubtful, at the mercy of repellent, perverse hick creeps who band together to systematically humiliate and abuse you. Based somewhat on the 70s classick, DAY OF THE WOMAN, a petite, polite, bright young woman secures the property of a wooden cabin in a secluded area nestled in some rural wilderness where trees surround her in every direction for a month so she can write a novel and enjoy peace and tranquility. She does absolutely nothing to deserve her fate at the hands of some repulsive locals with rotten manners who work at a gas station—who have little better to do that shoot the breeze, this woman their topic of conversation when one of the brood shows a recording of her in bra and panties while he was snooping around her cabin. This plants a devious seed in the mind of their ""leader"" (he's not the ultimate leader, but commands the attention of the boys when the masta isn't around)who claims he can bed the woman. This sets off a series of events which will allow them to gain control over her, forcing the woman to ""perform for them"" because they have strength in numbers, a baseball bat and a shiny pistol. The first intrusion inside her cabin is more about tormenting her( they like to belittle her with ""horse insults"", including ridicule with her teeth, having her suck on the nose of the pistol, so on and so forth), but it isn't long before the sexual abuse and rape enters the picture.The true ringleader of the clan is the supposed law abiding sheriff with a daughter and pregnant wife he cherishes. He masquerades as a ""god fearing man"" who seems hospitable when he's around the misses and baby girl, but once he's with the boys, the demon shows up and we see his true colors. The sheriff is evil incarnate, living out a deviant fantasy when he has a ""play purty"" to terrorize. What he does with his shot-gun, having her ""whinny"" like a horse, showing him her teeth, an elated smile on his face, the film ably establishes our sympathy for this poor girl who cannot even depend on a man of the law to save her. She is in hot water and so goes the movie for a while. The idea of rape revenge movies is to make the antagonists so vile and incorrigible and reprehensible, that we'll gleefully cheer when they are treated to some sweet revenge—violent carnage at the hands of what was once a civil and innocent woman. It's a plot gimmick that has become a staple in the rape-revenge genre. If you come to I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE desiring the standards, they are all here. Very similar in ways to LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT (the recent remake, I mean), the villains are perfectly loathsome and worthy of their comeuppance. There's the usual scene where a damaged, naked victim walks numbly and vacantly down a path in a daze, falling into a lake, not to mention the typical run through the woods trying to escape and unable to do so because those chasing after her know the area too well. The rape itself is shot in a way to leave an impression of the abuse without dwelling on the ugly details—fans of actual rape on screen(penetration or sexual explicitness)will be disappointed. I prefer the revenge anyway, and consider the actions of ridicule towards her far more monstrous because seeing a crying woman beg for those around her to leave her alone, all the while having a grand ole time at her expense, almost as menacing as the rape which usually follows afterward. Boy howdy is the revenge plentiful and worth waiting for. She is like a ghost who seems to have adopted a familiarity of the area, always a step ahead of the antagonists, somewhere near and out of reach while the boys grasp at straws trying to find her. And, one by one, each gets his just desserts. Lye water in a bathtub burning one's face off, fish-hooks holding a captive scumbag's eyes open as the crows land to peck them out( he gets to watch his fate by the same camcorder he used to record their activities against her), teeth pulled out with pliers, a castration by way of hedge clippers, and anal penetration through the use of a shotgun(which is tied to a thin rope which will cause the trigger to pull if a certain chosen victim awakens from his slumber). Those who endure the torture of the girl at the hands of her captors might certainly savor what happens to them. I just love the smirk at the very end which closes the film—after all the misogyny, I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE empowers the woman and she leaves the film perhaps to a satisfied crowd who witnessed her retaliation in all its bloody glory. Sarah Butler, not the greatest actress but courageous in what her character goes through, quite a trooper. Bottom line: those who hate these kinds of movies will feel the same about I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE. I think slasher fans should dig it, though.",I Spit on Your Grave
14,poolandrews,A tough film to watch at times but has a certain raw power & intensity.,6,27 January 2011,"I Spit on Your Grave starts as author Jennifer Hills (Sarah Butler) leaves the big city for a relaxing break in a luxury cabin deep within some woods just outside a small town, there Jennifer plans to take it easy & continue writing her latest book. While on her way to the cabin Jennifer stops off for gas & meets station attendant Johnny (Jeff Branson) & two of his friends Stanley (Daniel Franzese) & Andy (Rodney Eastman), Johnny tries it on with Jennifer but she knocks back his advances much to his bemusement. The pipes block at Jennifer's cabin & out comes local retard Matthew (Chad Lindberg) to fix the problem, later that day Matthew tells Johnny & his mates which annoys him even more & together they decide to get even & have some fun. Trapping Jennifer inside her cabin Johnny & his mates abuse, threaten & beat Jennifer but much worse is still to come as Jennifer suffers a gang rape & attempted murder as she is left for dead. Naturally upset by the incident Jennifer seeks a brutal revenge that fits the crime...Directed by Steven R. Monroe this is a remake of the notorious rape revenge exploitation flick I Spit on Your Grave (1978) as filmmakers continue to be obsessed with remaking old (I won't use the term 'claasic' in the case of I Spit on Your Grave) horror films but more often than not coming up well short, having said that I actually think the new I Spit on Your Garve is a better film than the original in almost every aspect. I have seen the original I Spit on Your Grave quite a few times over the years & I don't really want to compare the two that closely & every single little difference, basically the two films run a very similar path in which an author hires a cabin in the sticks & get gang raped & left for dead before embarking on some brutal revenge. The original I Spit on Your Grave is a straight forward film, it's fairly simple with a very long & protracted rape sequence although the revenge part of the film is rather tame while the I Spit on Your Grave remake is far more fleshed out with little incidents to shape the story better. The video tape, the rapists going back to Jennifer's cabin to burn her clothes, the murder of Earl, one of Jennifer's friends trying to phone her, the search for her body, the rapist Sheriff's family & the ways in which Jennifer tortures & kills her attackers are all themed & relevant (the video-camera guy has his eyes pecked out, the ass rapist gets a shotgun shoved up his). With a bit more story comes a bit more depth but not much & there are a few issues with the script (like how Jennifer survives drowning, how she manages to set all the traps up, why would a rapist film the crime & why did the other's let him?), the character's & events are still minimalist & abrupt, at an hour & three quarters long the time flew by while I was watching it actually & overall while not a pleasant film to watch I did like it. I liked it's brutality, I liked it uncompromising nature, I liked it's twisted morals, I liked the bleak downbeat tone & I liked it's nastiness. Don't go into I Sopit on Your Grave looking for morals or an emotional drama of a woman's recovery after being raped, this is hard & often difficult to watch with some disturbing moments of sexual abuse & graphic torture so anyone wanting an uplifting film or anyone even slightly easily offended should give this a miss. However, if you do like to have your limits tested, can take I Spit on Your Grave for what it is & have a twisted taste in films then I do actually recommend I Spit on Your Grave quite highly.While the emphasis of the original I Spit on Your Grave was a forty odd minute gang rape here it's definitely toned down, while the men humiliate & dehumanise Jennifer more before the rape begins the rape itself is much shorter & only two of the men are shown raping her. There's nudity & the rape is as brutal as the original while it's on screen but it's just that it's much shorter. On the other hand the revenge part of the film is far more effective & brutal than the original, there are some really nasty torture & gore scenes here from eyes being pecked out, fishing hooks put into eyelids in a truly painful looking sequence, a face is burned off with acid, teeth are pulled out, there's an off screen castration & the severed penis is shoved into it's former owner's mouth while there's also a fair bit of blood splatter & the torture scenes also go on for quite a while as the terror, pain & panic of the victims are dwelt upon. Shot in full 2:35:1 widescreen I Spit on Your Grave looks far better than it has any right too, it is very polished actually & very well shot.With a supposed budget of about $1,500,000 this had a limited theatrical run both here & in the US although I don't think it did great business which is understandable. Filmed in Louisiana. I thought the acting was very good actually, Sarah Butler was really hot in this & puts in a good performance that goes from scared victim to cold blooded killer.I Spit on Your Grave is maybe the most unlikely remake so far, to be honest I liked it, I liked it's brutality & it's polished good looks & actually think it's a better film than the original other than the sleazy 70's feel is obviously absent & a few minor lapses in the plot. Not bad, not bad at all.",I Spit on Your Grave
15,zardoz-13,Not As Gruesome But Faintly Artsy,6,2 April 2019,"""House of 9"" Director Steve Monroe's remake of Meir Zarchi's controversial classic ""I Spit on Your Grave"" (1978) boasts far more professional artistry than its crude but effective predecessor. Keep in mind, freshman writer & director Meir Zarchi pioneered a genre that has never outlived its infamy. Nevertheless, the new ""I Spit on Your Grave"" adheres to the formula with some finesse. Sarah Butler isn't as subtle an actress as the film required; her performance lacks spontaneity. She neither looks nor dresses like an author. Instead, her depraved assailants are more credibly cast and overshadow her. Chad Lindberg of ""The Fast and the Furious"" has a field day as the mentally deficient fellow, while Andrew Howard is a thoroughly repellent as the sheriff who rapes Jennifer after he discovers she has marihuana cigarettes. The detail that Howard brings to his role is admirable but gruesome. He flattens the unfortunate heroine face down in a pool of water, licks his hand, and then thrusts it out of sight behind him into her. Mind you, all the sex scenes are simulated, carefully photographed so genitalia is never presented in a conspicuous manner. Indeed, ""I Spit on Your Grace"" could be correctly classified as a sexploitation saga, but it never stoops to pornography. The film belongs to the horror genre. Jeff Branson plays the mechanic who ignites the drama when the unwitting heroine Jennifer embarrasses him at the gas station. She got lost in the boondocks and pulled up to a gas station to inquire about the directions to a secluded cabin in the woods. Scenarist Steve Morse has created a troupe of believable savages, but he doesn't make the abrupt reversal in Jennifer's character from Bimbo to Rambo seem realistic.Initially, Jennifer (Sarah Butler of ""Free Fall"") rents a place in the woods where she can work on her novel alone. Little does she know that the backwoods rednecks are ogling her every move. Stanley (Daniel Franzese of ""Mean Girls"") has been playing Peeping Tom and shooting video of Jennifer when she isn't aware of it. Later, this sleazy, potato chip munching moron records the drawn-out rape sequences that ensue. Unfortunately, most of the remake is contrived beyond belief, but strong performances from the rapists make us genuinely abhor these dastards. If you watch closely, a formula of sorts emerges in this unrated saga. The female victim is traumatized and humiliated during an extended rape sequences when the devious dastards violate her with ruthless abandon, while she screams in agony. You must have a strong stomach, and you must overcome the feeling of perversion to tolerate this grisly rape. Later, after they have satiated their lust on this unfortunate young lady, they slip up and allow her to escape. The scene where Jennifer scrambles onto a railway trestle, turns, and spreads her arms crucifixion style to perform a backwards plunge into the river is heavily symbolic. Monroe and Rockoff must have spent some time orchestrating the first half, because the second half is extremely brutal. Miraculously, Jennifer recovers and psyches herself enough to muster the gumption and exact revenge on this cretinous half-wits.Don't read another line of this review unless you want to whet your appetite for what lies ahead. She repays this bastards for defiling her. In one scene, she hangs tough-guy mechanic Johnny up stark naked and wields a pair of large shears. We don't see her cut Johnny's penis off, but we do see her stuff a sausage-shaped object into his smashed-up mouth. Just when you think that is enough, she devises an even worse scenario for the scumbag sheriff. Literally, she ties him down, so he is bent over a table, with a rifle barrel shoved up his anus. Noted film critic Roger Ebert helped forge an aura of notoriety for not only the original but also the remake with his blatantly negative reviews. In an interview, the original director of the 1978 film credited the success of the film largely on Ebert's vituperative review. Unwittingly, the movie that Ebert wanted nobody to see because an item of curiosity that everybody had to see, thus forging a cult hit. Meantime, three sequels have come out in rapid succession from the 2010 remake. There is nothing worse than rape, because the individuals who suffer this atrocity are irreparably broken in both body and mind. Meir Zarchi set out to make ""I Spit on Your Grave"" to show how heinous rape was and the vigilante behavior such an injustice afflicted the victim with when she is shown torturing her attackers. The sequel ""I Spit on Your Grave"" is neither for the tender-hearted nor the those liberally inclined to oppose the death penalty that our heroine imposes on her accosters.",I Spit on Your Grave
16,view_and_review,Probably the best revenge movie,8,30 March 2014,"I'm not from the South although I've visited it more than a few times. I'm not fond of it to tell you the truth, but between ""Deliverance"" and ""I Spit on Your Grave"" they are getting a really bad rap.Jennifer, a novelist, goes to the country to focus on her latest project. Along the way she ran into some of the local yokels that ended up being her tormentors. Five men, including a God-fearing sheriff and mentally handicapped plumber, had their way with her in the most horrendous fashion. After they finished with her, she was just starting with them.I never saw the 1978 original, but this movie was AWE-SOME. Who doesn't love a tale of revenge? The movie got brutal and hard to watch at one point, but I hung in there for the sweetest part.The better revenge/vigilante movies are hinged upon character development, an egregious act against another, and the method of justice delivered thereafter. I Spit on Your Grave was an A in all three categories. Not only was Jennifer's revenge so deliciously maniacal, the way she delivered it was even better. Her stoic demeanor and cold calculation was so nice. I'm not giving away anything here because any trailer or synopsis will tell you that this is about revenge. Some acts of retribution are more fulfilling than others, and this one just has to be seen.",I Spit on Your Grave
17,AlsExGal,Forgiving rapists is for sissies....,8,4 July 2015,"...that is, if you KNOW you have the right rapist, and Jennifer knows she does. In fact there are five of them. She's out in the middle of the woods, helpless, and assaulted by four brutes and one mentally challenged guy, Matthew, that I don't think would have even been there if not taunted by the other four. One of the five is a sheriff, possibly making him the worst, because he knows how to simulate being a decent man, but at his core he is a brute beast. Things escalate past the point of where these five initially intended things to go with the girl, turning into torture and gang rape, and they feel they must kill Jennifer or they will all go to jail. However Jennifer falls into the river before they can. The sheriff, the default lead because of his triple digit I.Q., tells another to destroy the videotape they made of the whole thing (Did these guys never hear of Watergate?). But he doesn't. He loads a blank tape and keeps the tape of the entire assault as a souvenir. Crime lesson #1 - Don't ally yourself with stupid people.The sheriff has a plan of doubling back along the river until the body is found or surfaces. But it never does. So first these guys turn on each other as their panic level steadily increases. Then as souvenirs from the rape appear - one of Jennifer's sandals, the rope they used, the (a copy of???) the videotape of the rape mailed to the sheriff's house, their panic turns to paranoia. All along four of the five show no remorse, just fear of being caught. They collectively turn on Matthew thinking he must be doing all of this because he is the only one not concerned with being caught and full of remorse.The four go looking for him, probably to kill him, but they find something else. Watch and find out what they find. Caution if you have hypertension or a bad heart because this film is intense.There is lots of debate as to whether this is a waste of celluloid or not. I certainly believe the second half of the film is just gore without the first half, and unfortunately incidents like the first half of the film happen all of the time. Google ""home invasion rape"" and see what floats to the surface. The thing is we the people are tired of this sort of thing. We are tired of rapists being treated with kid gloves. Tired of rape victims being told they need to forgive, go to therapy, write feminist poetry and behave like good little victims. Many people, including me, believe rape is worse than murder because there can be a million explanations - not necessarily excuses - for murder, but there is none for rape other than the rapist being a base brute who wants to take the supreme act of intimacy between two human beings and twist it into an act of cruelty. Almost like murdering someone and then magically bringing them back to life to forever remember their own violent death. Since rape is worse than murder, murder is the least rapists should receive in return.As long as the U.S. continues to go down the failed path of Europe of believing everybody is redeemable, expect to see more of these films. I think that is why The Walking Dead is so popular. In a world without law, sure, there would be more lawlessness, but at least we would know who the bad guys are and be able to dispense with them quickly. And let me tell you quick justice like in the days of the old west, does give criminals pause. What does not give them pause is the system we have now.Too late to make a long review short, this movie touches on a couple of interesting ideas. The first is not an idea, it's a reality. Crimes involving multiple offenders are usually much more violent than those involving one because multiple people will meld into one violent whole...until the crime is over and then they turn on each other almost invariably. The second is the idea that what if what/who returns is not Jennifer, but some ""angel of revenge"" that just takes her physical form since some of the things she does involve almost super human strength or speed? The third idea is...did the last half of the movie happen at all? Maybe it is Jennifer's hallucination as she lays dying on the river bank. There is lots to explore here if you have the stomach for it.",I Spit on Your Grave
18,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Impressive effort with a troubling storyline,7,5 October 2015,"Heading out into the woods for a relaxing retreat, a writer's encounter with a group of locals who continually rape and demoralize her lead her to decide to seek revenge on the group for their actions one-by-one.Frankly this here turned out to be quite the enjoyable remake with a lot to offer it. What really stands out here is the fact that this one tends to really bring out the central advance and stalking done to her early on in preparation for the main sequence here, not only going through the early meetings in town while she's preparing for the trip up there but her general attitude and behavior while up there. From their spying on her walking around the cabin in her underwear, going out on her jogging runs trying to snap pictures of her in reveal outfits and the flirting attempts done while having them work on the cabin itself all manage to make for quite an unsettling time here in preparation for the most harrowing sequence here in the central rape sequence. Starting off in the night-before with their breaking in and physically abusing her beforehand with their taunting and sexually-demeaning antics, the main course is the truly repulsive and despicable rapes done in the woods as the entire group take turns laughing and filming the whole thing which has an even greater emphasis here on setting up the course of action to come. Not only that, but to lead into the actual revenge here makes this come off even better with these scenes coming off as a cathartic release over what had happened to her, generating plenty of graphic kills and torture here that's appropriate and comes off quite nicely. Naturally, there are some flaws here to be found in something like this, and most of it is certainly found in the set-up and execution of its central premise. The very act itself is certainly something that in principle most people would never feel comfortable viewing even if in brief segments, and to showcase it as this does in as much detail and for as long as it does is certainly tempting the limits out there for some who might not handle such an activity in the first place so focusing on it like it does here might not be very welcome. As well, the fact that it tends to really throw the group into such a despicable light in order to set-up the main revenge theme throughout here does wear a little thin throughout, concentrating more on getting sure her actions are completely justifiable and wholly welcomed that it loses a lot of reality here in making them just a little too out-there in ensuring her coming back for them happens. That does tend to lower this somewhat, but beyond all of this the ability to handle the film's main centerpiece sequence will be what determines this one.Rated R: Continuous and Brutal Rape scenes with plenty of degradation, demoralization and humiliation of its' main target, Full Graphic Nudity, Extreme Graphic Language, Extreme Graphic Violence, drug use.",I Spit on Your Grave

However, what starts out as terrifying acts of humiliation and intimidation, quickly and uncontrollably escalates into a night of physical abuse and torturous assault. But before they can kill her, Jennifer sacrifices her broken and beaten body to a raging river that washes her away. As time passes, the men slowly stop searching for her body and try to go back to life as usual. But that isn't about to happen.....To start off, this film isn't nice to watch. In fact sometimes it's almost unbearable. If you've seen the original, you know what to expect, and this delivers.Butler is fantastic as the lead, and we feel her pain throughout. The rest of the cast are good, and for some reason, the deaths didn't feel 'satisfying' enough, even though they were highly original and graphic.don't be perturbed by the nay sayers, you know what to expect when you are watching a film like this, uneasy, awkward viewing.It's a good job that the cast put in such good performances, which surpasses the original by a milestone.Just don't make it a date movie.",I Spit on Your Grave
20,trashgang,way to long before things go awry,5,9 February 2011,"Do I have to introduce you'll to the original I Spit On Your Grave? I don't think so. It was a sick flick that you never forget once you have seen it. Once it became a classic and now that it is available uncut on Blu Ray after being a ""video nastie"" it was, sigh, time to remake it. Some things you better leave untouched. Really, the original one was really sickening due the brutality of the rapers as the revenge. It was written by and even directed by Meir Zarchi. So the remakers thought, well, let him be involved. The movie on his own is not that bad, Sarah Butler did well and luckily they chose her for her abilities and not someone for the tits. Face it, most horrors depend on the nudity and mostly you will get plastic hooters. But here we will get the natural beauty of a normal, sigh, boob. Anyhow. In the UK the movie was already cut for the, here we go again, rape scene. I saw the uncut version and must say, there was nothing to see. For me it was a bit lame, go watch Irreversible, then you will see a rape you will never forget. But Sarah acted well but surely it wasn't explicit. She do runs full frontal naked for a while so for the creeps, I mean you out there and not the ones in the film, it's a hurray. But again, I would never made this flick with the pretension of saying, this ""IS"" I Spit On Your Grave. The movie was okay but it took a while before things went wrong. And they never had the atmosphere we had in for example Deliverance or the original version. It's only in the last 25 minutes that the revenge starts and I must admit, it's gory and surely not for the squeamish. But it was a bit too late. Normally I would tear this flick down but due the last 25 minutes and Sarah I gave it a 5. Are the others unbelievable? No they are not but they don't look like bushwhackers they are just a bunch of macho's. I was a bit bored in the beginning and when the cop arrived I could guess immediately that he's a bad cop.

22,Smells_Like_Cheese,Hell hath no fury like a woman scored... and the devil has a date with Jennifer Hills tonite,5,12 February 2011,"The original I Spit on Your Grave is known to be one of the most graphic and horrifying exploitation films of the 1970's, it's also famously known more so as Roger Ebert's most hated movie. I read his review, I think he was more upset with his movie experience even if he disliked the movie, I think the audience upset him more so. I saw the original film over a decade ago when I was in high school, a friend of mine who was my film buddy gave me the VHS and said I would have never seen anything like it and he was right, it was extremely brutal and unsettling. For some reason I bought the VHS a little later wanting to see it again and look to see what the message was or if the director was some kind of a sick pervert just looking to cash in on exploiting violence on women. I think the film is misunderstood, as hard as it is to watch the director had to make the rape scene brutal to help the outcome. The film is like a grindhouse movie though, the acting isn't that good and you can tell it's low budget. So when I heard that there was going to be a remake I was beyond excited because I figured that with better money equals a better movie most likely, so here's the story first.Jennifer Hills is going to the cabin in the woods down south to write her novel. On her way to the cabin she gets lost and pulls into a gas station where she encounters a group of men. She accidentally spills some fluid on the head of the group, Johnny, and hits the panic button on her car, scaring him. The other guys make fun of him for getting scared. Jennifer drives off into the gravelly road to the cabin. Nightfall comes and Jennifer begins to hear noises around the house. Her fears are realized when the gang from the gas station come to the cabin. After they mess with her, she is able to escape the cabin and runs off into the woods. She bumps into the sheriff, Storch, he brings Jennifer back to the cabin acting like he is going to help her. After an improper pat down, the boys come through the door and she realizes that they are all together on their plan to rape her. After they are done, she just gets up and walks out the cabin and into the woods. She is confronted by the gang again for more torture. She gets up again and walks out of the woods and onto a bridge. Just when Storch is going to shoot her, Jennifer jumps into the river. A month passes before Jennifer returns. She has survived in the woods for a month eating, as she explains later, bugs and other things and has been staying in a run-down house in the woods. She starts playing games with the group. Jennifer is Hell's most scorned woman and revenge is a dish best served cold.I have to say that I was a bit disappointed with this film, while the acting is certainly better and the revenge is more hard core, that's what makes it bad to me. In an era where we have the Saw and Hostel films it seemed like the movie more wanted to take advantage of just having some extreme gore vs. telling a story. The rape scene is done well without making that sound perverted, but it is very uncomfortable and just sad to watch and a lot more trimmed down from the original which can either make you grateful or resentful that you don't see as much brutality to justify the ending. I'm still on debate about that but as a woman I have to admit that it's a relief that like with Jennifer you just want to pass out with her and get past the rough parts. But then her revenge scenes, we go from a gruesome rape to comical revenge that is so beyond unrealistic. Understandably, they want to really give it to these creeps that raped her, but it's a little extreme where I thought the original was more realistic on how she lured the guys back and got her revenge. Also I appreciated in the original how we see Jennifer recover back, as hard to see her in such pain but again we needed to see it in order to understand and justify her revenge. Instead we are left with a million questions: How did she survive the jump off the bridge? How did she steal the boy's camera? Why would she come to the sheriff's family now that they've seen her and know her real name and he disappears with her? Wouldn't his family have a better lead on Jennifer that way? You're really telling me that if she survives that jump off the bridge the first thing she wants is revenge instead of getting out of that town or going to get help? Like I said in the original it's understood better seeing her recover.I Spit On Your Grave has some positive qualities about it, being in the acting and the rape scene being more painful to see how they torment this poor girl. But the ending just completely lost me and while the revenge is a lot more brutal and that's what these boys really deserved, it's hard to believe that 90 pound Sarah Butler can drag a full grown man across the woods and set up these traps. Fun to fantasize about but now what the original director was aiming for I think.5/10",I Spit on Your Grave
23,KineticSeoul,More brutal but that is about it,4,26 January 2011,"This movie is different from the original in a way, mostly because the girl that get victimized doesn't seem as graphic as the original cause it skips the scenes where she gets hunted down and constantly raped. Although the parts where the girl gets humiliated drags on and on. And the revenge scenes are more creative and brutal than the original. The redneck villains are more disgusting in this and yet the original somehow got me to hate the villains even more and root for the girl when she does her revenge thing. Besides the revenge being a bit more creative, nothing is all that different from the original. The culprits in both is evil and deserve what they have coming for the most part, but it still wasn't a satisfying movie and overall a pointless remake. Besides the upgraded brutality, there isn't anything that is worth watching in this.4.2/10",I Spit on Your Grave
24,Hellmant,"'Vile bag of garbage', 'Misunderstood masterpiece' or neither?",8,27 January 2011,"'I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE' (2010): Four Stars (Out of Five) Modern remake of one of the most controversial films of all time 'DAY OF THE WOMAN' (which was it's original limited release title in 1978, it was later retitled 'I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE' to capitalize on it's notoriety when it was given a major release in 1980). The film and it's 1978 predecessor both deal with rape, savage torture and murder. Both films have been highly criticized because of this with critics like Roger Ebert giving both films a zero star rating and calling the original a ""vile bag of garbage"". Almost an equal number of supporters (of the original film), including high profile critics, have raised their voices in defense of the film as well, with many labeling it a misunderstood masterpiece. Opposers of the film claim that it's man hating (with reports of some men walking out of the theater in disgust at both films) and some also accuse the film of glorifying violence against women (for it's violent rape scenes). Defenders of the films claim the movies are 'pro women' feminism and cathartic. People have been debating these issues for thirty two years and they'll probably go on debating them for longer than that and that's a good thing. If a movie causes that much discussion you have to give it some respect just for that.Both films tell the story of a writer named Jennifer Hills (played by Sarah Butler in the new film and Camille Keaton in the original, Keaton is the grand-niece of Buster Keaton and won a Best Actress award for the role at the 1978 Catalonian International Film Festival) who heads to a cabin in the woods to work on her next novel. Once there she attracts a lot of attention from some hooligan hippies which eventually escalates in them braking into the cabin, raping her repeatedly and leaving her for dead. She unknowingly survives the viscous attacks and seeks out brutally sadistic revenge on all of the men involved, including a mentally handicap young man who was coerced into involvement by his buddies.The remake was directed by Steven R. Monroe and written by Stuart Morse. The writer and director of the original film, Meir Zarchi, served as an executive producer on the film. Zarchi has said that he was inspired to make the original film after coming across a young rape victim in New York and escorting her to the police (which he says was the wrong decision considering how incompetent they were in the matter) and later the hospital for assistance. He defends the violence of the film as being completely necessary and rejects any criticisms that it is exploitative.As far as the remake compares to the original film it's technically far superior on every level; it's better filmed, acted, written and directed (the original film had to manage with a much smaller budget though). The new film also shortens the rape scenes, in comparison to the much more explicit original, and relies more on psychologically implied imagery (which I think was a smarter decision). It also elaborates and extends the violent revenge scenes with much more creative deaths (much like many popular horror films). Where as the first half is more realistic and believable the second half branches much more into 'grindhouse' style revenge fantasy. While the film is much better than the original in all those ways it'll never be as remembered and cherished as a cult classic by fans.I personally don't agree with the film's critics or it's supporters. I don't think you're supposed to necessarily agree with the heroine's actions or condone them and I definitely don't think you're intended to agree with the assailants' actions (that's a ridiculous argument). I think the film raises a lot of thoughts (most of them unpleasant) and discussion which like I said is something the films deserve credit for. A movie should never be judged by the actions of the characters within it, so however disgusting and disturbing they are (and in these films they're atrocious) it doesn't mean that they're bad films. I think both films are well made to a certain extent and effective at what they attempt to do. They're definitely not for everyone and very hard to watch but they're also memorable and dialogue inducing.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgaAYiwY0g0",I Spit on Your Grave
25,thesar-2,Another Day of the Woman,2,30 January 2011,"It shouldn't be a surprise there wasn't enough spit in the box office to even dampen this remake's grave.There's virtually no reason to see 2010's I Spit on Your Grave. Even with a teen boy's (actually sick) fantasy of a gang bang rape scene that goes on longer than the typical internet's entry, it's not as graphic as one might think. Sure, it's bad, horrifying perhaps, but only for those who haven't either seen the original or any other rape scene in a horror/suspense flick.Personally, I have seen the buck-fifty-budgeted 1978 revenge film, and not for the same reasons mentioned above – of course, those who know me, know that's a given. I just remember Roger Ebert's vile attack on the movie provoking me to see it.It was eh – again, it had less of a budget than the main star had clothes following her attack. This 2010 ""update"" only followed the same pattern/guidelines and increased the budget.That ""same pattern/guidelines"" I speak of? Well, Jennifer (Butler) aka woman (hence the original, original title: Day of the Woman) goes it alone in isolated lake cabin and all but immediately gets sexually attacked and taunted by the local back-wooded gang. Is she to blame since she did the stereotypical no-no's, i.e. alcohol, marijuana and inadvertently mocking her soon-to-be captives? Well, duh, no – watch the 1,000 times better The Accused for proof.Supposedly, she spends some time in the woods when she's able to escape the rapists and in this short time, she's managed to gather herself, obtain money (to ship a video they took of the attack), new clothes, a shower and if those aren't all unbelievable enoughshe also devises extensive Saw-like torture plans for the bad men that caused her indescribable pain.Absolutely, I can state that nothing of this magnitude has happened to me – as probably 96%+ of the population can safely agree, but in my untarnished view – she went far beyond retribution. Granted she couldn't go to the cop (yeah, singular) of this them partsfor spoiler reasons, I'll leave it at that. But there's a line where you not only match your adversary's sins, you become far more evil than what they could've done. This woman, Jennifer, goes so far in this movie that even if you wanted to see a woman scorned get her just deserts, I would think most people would actually start to feel sorry for the men.The only, and again – SICK, example of how anyone could've gone any further than the torture Jennifer caused on the hillbillies following her Inspector Gadget phase, was someone raping an innocent victim and the first objective is for that victim to go and kill the attacker's children.There's nothing here to see but woman attacked and woman attacking back. Unfortunately, it was further torture for them to make this 70-80 minute concept into a spitting 107 minutes. Skip it, like everyone else in 2010 when it came and went faster than you can, well, spit.",I Spit on Your Grave
26,Robert_duder,"The ultimate vengeance, hard to watch but brutally efficient",8,8 January 2012,"Its funny that essentially a slasher flick brings about such serious discussion about whether our anti-heroine was right or wrong and the legalization of it and how it even brings up opinions about rape and torture. I suppose there is nothing wrong with that but for me this is a movie, meant to entertain in one facet or another and I Spit On Your Grave does that in a twisted and disturbing way. I have not seen the cult classic original thought I would like to but I think they really nailed this one because they told the story perfectly in all its brutality. It is the ultimate vengeance flick and its not different than SAW or any other brutal horror flick in its delivery.Sarah Butler is perfect in her role. She seems so innocent and calm in the beginning and you don't think she could ever come back with violent and disturbing behavior and she does and then some. Butler is brilliant in the role. The guys in the film all do a decent job in their role. They are appropriately sleazy and disgusting but none of them really stand out. The only one that gives us a bit of a different twist on the typical villain is Matthew played by Chad Lindberg who is a simple mentally handicapped man who is forced to do horrible things to her. It opens up a whole discussion as to whether he deserved what he got or whether in essence he was a victim too but regardless Lindberg is good.I Spit On Your Grave is absolutely a twisted and disturbing movie. Is it a necessary film? No. Its a lot like Last House On The Left...I like the film for what it is, it does open a lot of conversation about rape and vengeance but I would never watch either that film or this one again because its not entertaining but rather a twisted look into things that do happen. Director Steven Monroe clearly loves horror flicks and is nearly a master of the B-Movie genre and this might be his most serious film when you look at it. Regardless he knows how to put you on the edge of your seat and leave you gaping at the gory death scenes. If you love horror then you probably will like this film but there is no doubt that it is a very disturbing flick, and not something you'd watch just for fun or would want to. 8.5/10",I Spit on Your Grave
27,CuriosityKilledShawn,I thumb through your magazines,2,1 March 2011,"Revenge flicks are among the most simplistic, and it's a genre more over-done than even the dreaded romantic comedy. The original crime and victimization appeals to sadists while offending decent-minded people who are just looking for a good movie. The boomerang effect of the initial violence again appeals to the sadists while the decent-minded people become sadists themselves. No one walks away clean.Very few revenge flicks get the balance right. Most of them become seedy, ugly, and nasty. Meir Zarchi's original (which he cunningly called 'Day of the Woman' to imply that he was celebrating female power) is probably the muckiest revenge flick out there, even dirtier than Michael Winner's Death Wish II. As a matter of fact it might be the dingiest film ever made. Why on earth any sane human being would want to remake it is beyond me, The acting and film-making is TV quality stuff. It's better than Meir Zarchi's effort. But snuff movies have better production values than the original. Despite its slick, modern look, I Spit on Your Grave is just as tawdry as it always has been.Chad Lindberg, who really deserves better movies than this, is the only reason to watch. Just keep a bar of soap handy.",I Spit on Your Grave

A group of local lowlifes break in and begin a shockingly brutal torture and rape on her, thinking she is dead they think its over. She then hunts them down one by one and exacts her own terror upon them. All I've heard about this movie was how shocking and graphic it is. The original was banned in many countries. After watching it I have to say it wasn't nearly as bad as I was expecting. The rape scene was no worse then the one in ""Last House On The Left"", it just went on a little longer (the one in ""Girl With The Dragon Tattoo was worse) and the rest of the killings were actually not as bad as in the ""Saw"" movies. It may be that with all of the ""Saw"" and ""Hostel"" and other ""let's see how many people we can cut up in two hour"" movies I am becoming used to it, but this was not as bad as I expected.

After all of that she wants to take her revenge and we watch how is going to do this.I believe that this movie has many scenes that are really more creepy than in the first movie and more gruesome.

32,Floated2,Straight forward and serves its purpose,7,10 January 2021,"Having not seen the original film but only just watching this apparent remake. No expectations were had as this film was about as expected. A strong and violent revenge thriller about a woman left for dead getting her obvious revenge on those who tortured her.The buildup to the act is quite strong as we are introduced to the lead character of Jennifer and she is likeable enough.What felt somewhat unrealistic is how she was able to survive the rapes and tortures. After the main rape scene in the woods, we see her waking up then start walking out of the woods onto the bridge then lunging herself into the lake. Even though she was just tortured she was able to get the strength and survive under the water for sometime- as the villains didn't spot her.Then of course a month time pass and when she resurfaces, she gets her revenge on the men one by one. She somehow is able to organize these difficult and creative setups all by her self- which felt unrealistic in how she was able to stage all these elaborate revenge schemes. But nonetheless, we are to believe it.At this point we are led to believe that Jennifer is not a typical ""city"" woman and more so deranged and not so innocent. But in the end she got her revenge and things worked in her favor.Although the film deals with strong torture and such, there is a constant engagement in that we are rooting for Jennifer and we want to see what she does next.",I Spit on Your Grave
33,filipemanuelneto,Another remake of an old movie.,6,10 October 2020,"This film is the remake of an older film from the Seventies, which fell into relative forgetfulness due to it's brutality, very graphic and raw. The new film is very faithful to it's predecessor and tells, in essence, the same story.In the film, young writer Jennifer leaves the city and goes to the countryside, where her beauty stands out and attracts the unwanted attention of a group of men who come together to arrest and sexually abuse her. Repeatedly raped, humiliated, beaten and wounded in her body and in her self-love, she is left to die by the group, which also belongs to the local sheriff, one of the most brutal rapists. Attempts to cover up the crime are evident, but nothing works: she survives and comes back to avenge herself, killing them all in a revenge that only a wounded woman would be able to do.The film is quite tough and violent, but the degree of rawness and brutality is much lower than it's predecessor of the Seventies. The older film was much more difficult to see, has a greater and more shocking degree of violence and its cast spends a considerable part of the film undressed, which is why I considered this film highly inadvisable for adults who are more impressionable (of course, it's an unthinkable film for young people or children). More than rape, what shocks and disturbs us in this film is the way men who are perfectly inserted in that social environment and even has some prestigious positions - the sheriff's example - manage to be capable of those atrocities and have such awareness of their own impunity. Another thing that strikes us is the way she kills them, with refinements of cynicism and some pleasure, as we see in horror slasher films. The cast consists of a series of illustrious strangers. Still, I liked the work of Sarah Butler and Andrew Howard, both of whom are very committed to their characters.Technically, it is a film that does not stand out nor has much to present. Not having a high budget, it used what it had. There is a lot of blood, and the makeup work has been done quite well. The film uses a reduced and discreet soundtrack, which lets the plot itself to shine. Cinematography does not stand out, either the sets and costumes.",I Spit on Your Grave

35,TheMovieDiorama,"I Spit On Your Grave isn't enjoyable, it's mentally scarring.",6,24 February 2018,"Honestly, I'm not sure how to wrap my thoughts around this and cohesively write a review. Everything about this film, is just wrong. But that's the point. Does that necessarily make it a good film? Perhaps, perhaps not. A young woman stays in a remote cabin where she is terrorised and ambushed by a group of men (including the local sheriff). Presumed missing, she returns to seek justice by her own twisted methods. ""Twisted"" is gently describing this harrowing story. Simply put, this is disgusting. Two horrific rape scenes, elaborate torture set pieces and an eye wincing amount of gore. Clearly it was going for the shock factor, to which it succeeds. Hands down, I've not seen anything quite like this. The amount of comments I was making throughout its runtime...""seriously!? You're going to rape her again!?"", ""Oh she's going to do it...oh ohhhh...OHHH she did it!!"" and ""Revenge is a dish best served cold, even if it is a shotgun up the bum!"". I'm not a huge fan of the ""torture"" sub-genre, I believe it is rather divisive but I can see its appeal to genre enthusiasts. However, making something shocking just so that it is memorable and intimidating doesn't make a good ""film"". You have to encompass every aspect. At the end of the day, it is a glorified B-Movie about revenge. I'll give credit to Sarah Butler, it cannot have been easy to film certain scenes and I thought she did pretty well. Everyone else could've been replaced and it wouldn't have made a difference. The second act was a slog, the interval where we wait for her to reappear seemed to go on forever. She then all of a sudden becomes an expert at torture, I mean some of those contraptions like the bath filled with lye were just too elaborate. Don't get me started on why she would even stay in that cabin alone anyway! Did we need a remake of the 1978 cult film? Who knows, but we've got one and it is brutally savage.

It was going to be hard to make a better version. To my surprise, the remake contains the elements that the original lacked off.First of all, for a mainstream movie, it's pretty violent and sadistic. We get uncomfortable torture scenes involving raping, beatings, gunshots, a rifle stuck up in a man's butt, castration, a disfigured face, ravens eating a man's eye, and more.The raping scene is not as intense as in the original but still it's painful to watch. The female lead is humiliated in every possible way. She gets sweet revenge by applying torture methods.This movie takes the ""Saw"" direction by creating inventive torture sequences theater hard to believe were done by a fragile pretty girl. Then, when did she become Jason Voorthees to have the ability to teleport?. Well, we can forget these kind of things because the violence is really good.The movie can be divided in three parts: 1) Girl is humiliated, beaten, raped. 2) Boring scenes to fill the running time. 3) She gets sweet and gory revenge.The acting is great. Sarah Butler needs recognition. The girl can become a Scream Queen.Watch this remake in order to witness one of the most brutal and raw remakes. In the likes of the 2009 remake of ""Last House on the Left"" it ranks high on the violence factor.",I Spit on Your Grave
37,jtindahouse,Really benefits from not cutting scenes down,8,25 October 2015,"'I Spit on Your Grave' is a remake of the infamous 1978 film of the same name (or as it was originally titled 'Day of the Woman'). The original became a cult classic for its brutality and debatable sense of morality. Of course by the time the 2010 remake came around this type of film was being released by the dozen every month seemingly and audiences were pretty numb to the whole concept of revenge/torture by then. So while it doesn't have the shock element the original had going for it, this time around it's a much better made film and this is what we as an audience are being upgraded to. Afterall there has to be a reason for doing a remake other than simply making money (not that there always is).The biggest increase in quality was Sarah Butler in the lead role. She was cast absolutely perfectly. A strong woman who was believable in the role and really did act her butt of the entire film. The rest of the cast, while a little hard to understand at times (we'll put that down to heavy accents), were also very good and hid well the fact this was made on a very tight budget by the sound of things.I love that these films are discussion raisers. Is she justified in her actions? Even if she was, did she go too far? What comes next? Whatever your point of view is on all these things, it's likely you have a strong one. I read that they didn't cut anything from the film and left it unrated which is a huge thumbs up in my book, and I wish more films would follow in those footsteps. Let's see the film the way the filmmaker intended to tell it. To do anything else on a film like this would have been a crime.

38,BeneCumb,"Visually scary and naturalistic, but uneven and protracted",6,16 January 2015,"Movies about revenge have always been popular among some audiences, and some of them have even obtained large box offices (e.g. Death Wish series), but it is recommended to have a meaningfully created story, or something based on true events. I Spit on Your Grave, however, has too long introduction, flaws in the course of events, and unsettled issues and elements... For example, how did the woman really get away? What did she do thereafter, where she was before getting her revenge? As she used to be a writer with lanky physique, how was she able to make the strong young men ready for her ""operations""? How everything was carried without any precautions as for DNA and fingerprints? I am sure lots of viewers just shrugged their shoulders, and were forced to watch brutal scenes and perhaps pondering on and over how they could have acted in such situations. It still seems than main focus was brought into nasty deeds and horror, as the U.S. has very hard punishments for rape, thus it is pointless and definitely dangerous to take the matters into own hands - as we see in this movie. Don't do this yourself - I would say.Performances were generally okay, without exaggerations often characteristic to similar movies, that is way I could call the movie in question as a so-so movie experience. Definitely, I can't say it is a flop, because I have seen dozens of really stupid and ridiculous movies on related topics.",I Spit on Your Grave
39,dee.reid,"While a better film than the original, I still PREFER the original...",6,12 October 2012,"I remember watching the original 1978 ""I Spit on Your Grave"" earlier this year and thinking that it packed one hell of a visceral punch while also carrying quite an angry proto-feminist slant. Yeah, it was obviously a low-budget exploitation horror picture with a strong feminist subtext, but it was both shocking and challenging on a deep emotional level - challenging everything you thought you knew about humanity, justice, violence, and revenge & retribution.Anyone who watches the film with an open mind will indeed find a powerful and angry film, one that takes no prisoners, nor does it try to play it safe for the safety and comfort of the audience. It was meant to shock, horrify, and provoke strong reactions and discussions.These are things that the original ""I Spit on Your Grave"" (originally titled ""Day of the Woman"") and its 2010 remake of the same name, directed by Steven R. Monroe, have in common.While sharing the same set-up - about a beautiful young novelist from the city named Jennifer Hills (played by Sarah Butler here, Camille Keaton in the 1978 original) who retreats to the backwoods to write her latest novel and is assaulted by a gang of country lowlifes and later exacting brutal, bloody systematic revenge against them - the remake is still very much a very different film. (It's a much better-made film, with better acting, writing and directing, and has better special effects. It's less raw and rugged, but it's somehow slightly more enjoyable.)For one, the original 1978 ""I Spit on Your Grave"" and its 2010 remake are very much products of their time; Meir Zarchi, who directed the original and was also involved in the production of this film, was reportedly inspired to make the film after his encounter with a young rape victim back in the '70s. As such, he made a film that while it had an extremely low budget and no-name performers (though Camille Keaton was the grand-daughter of Hollywood acting legend Buster Keaton), was nonetheless compelling, challenging, and shocking. (How shocking, you ask? Well, movie critic Roger Ebert gave the film no stars and has been behind efforts to have the film both banned and blacklisted.) The original film, made in the wake of women's liberation, was also slammed as feminist propaganda - allegedly because it features a lone female exacting vengeance on her all-male gang of attackers.By comparison, Monroe's film doesn't carry the same visceral punch to the gut that Zarchi's original did. It was raw, brutal, and ugly; and it was also saying something about victims and their attackers. But because horror films have been getting increasingly gorier in the wake of the ""Saw"" and ""Hostel"" films and their like-minded imitators in the ""torture porn"" sub-genre of horror, the violence here is really not all that shocking. The original film got by on its raw intensity alone, an element of the original film that was helped immensely by its low budget, which gave it an almost-documentary-style feel to it. The one drawback, however, was the original Jennifer Hills's all-too-convenient transformation from victim to avenger in too short a time frame.As such, the 2010 ""I Spit on Your Grave"" seems to more or less conform to these current torture-porn movie standards, with Sarah Butler's Jennifer Hills character torturing her attackers in elaborately gruesome ways before finally executing them altogether. The one benefit of this is that a much longer time frame passes before Jennifer gets her sweet revenge, which makes her actions and subsequent transformation from victim to victor a little bit more believable. On the other hand, though, she's given to making cheesy slasher movie-style one-liners as she tortures her former tormentors to death.Overall, while ""I Spit on Your Grave"" is a better-made film and I enjoyed it more, I didn't get that same level of intensity from it that I got from the original ""I Spit on Your Grave."" Because it abides more by contemporary horror standards, it lessens the overall impact. It is still, however, a valiant remake that was not a complete waste of time (like most horror movie remakes).6/10",I Spit on Your Grave

And I am reminded of a favorite line which my research into this dark realm brought me, it is not a direct quote, but I've reworked it into my own style, thus: ""I'd rather be the songbird. I don't know how the falcon lives with itself.""Okay, so there's the 1978 original, THE DAY OF THE WOMAN, later retitled I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE. So controversial at its time, few would dare to venture telling such a tale. Now there is a spate of them in the franchise. It's this one, with its recent sequel, I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE III - VENGEANCE IS MINE, and the one in- between, the interloper I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE 2. I've only seen this one. But before I discuss it, let me just say that there is an absolutely gloriously filmed 1989 Australian movie by the name of FAIR GAME (now don't get confused by the three other movies with the same title, and, for crying out loud, it is NOT the one with Naomi Watts!) that is absolutely a must-see. It is also a whole lot less explicit and bloody than this one, in fact, a wild movie, a very, very wild movie, of yesteryear (although it was just the other day, really) now suddenly looks tame like a Sunday school picnic compared to 2010's I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE.It's unthinkable for a young girl to be alone out on her own. Even just walking to a corner café at night. I live in a dangerous crime- ridden country and the absence of locked doors in American films always feels kinda weird to me. Isn't crime just everywhere? But if you are a hot, pretty thing like Jennifer Hills, chanced are that somebody has an eye on you, and I don't mean in the flowery romantic sense. And if there is no security (hell, what sense is a padlocked door if the window doesn't have bars in front of it?) and some creep wants to get to you...While the unlikeliness of a soft-hearted girl turning into a vengeful killing machine able to do things that would at the very least require physical strength (how did she get Andy lifted up to balance on those boards on the bath?) reveals a lack of credibility in the plot, one could but hope that at least one would-be rapist viewing this title could forever be turned off by the very idea of such a crime, not that the movie itself would, I'm sure the alpha brutes just scoff at it, but perhaps just the wilting notion striking home of intimately-executed revenge associated with it...Thank you to Sarah Butler for having been very, very brave, and using her body to portray a victim.

In the run-up to ""I Spit on Your Grave II"", I sat myself down and watch this one first. I'm not sure I'm going to watch the second part after this experience. In my opinion it's not really a horror film. It is rather a revenge movie visualized in a very explicit and confrontational manner. This film is a remake of the original film from 1978, which I have never seen and so I can't make a comparison of this remake and conclude if it was a successful remake or not.The first part of the movie is awful and hard to get through. They could have made the whole rape scene a bit shorter. But it would be a very short movie if they did that because it eventually covers just two facets: the rape and the revenge. And in the revenge part she had those hilly-billy's literally and figuratively by the balls. The first part was so violent and to sickening for words. The humiliations were inhuman. The panicky feeling and anguish she endured was screaming from the screen. I felt a vicarious shame all the time.Why would someone still watch this movie until the end ? Because you know how it will end, and you can't wait until those bastards get tit for tat. And most preferably in the most brutal, ruthless and sadistic manner. And this movie fully succeeds in that. Several times I was looking at it with a ""Hehehehe suits you right, you scumbag""-feeling. There were fairly inventive revenge moments that nicely matched in line with what the person did during the raping : peeking/filming, immersing in water, the teeth-provocation and anal rape. They all underwent the same. One more brutal and painful as the other. I even had no sympathy for Matthew despite he was mentally retarded. And actually there were a few who were treated to softly. Suffering a bit more wouldn't be that bad ! This is such a movie where it sounds tremendously weird and inappropriate when you would say ""I've enjoyed it and it was a good entertaining film ...""

45,Jonny_Numb,Spit Redux: Spit Harder,8,14 March 2011,"My in-quotations ""fanfare"" for Meir Zarchi's notorious 1978 rape-and-revenge shocker ""I Spit On Your Grave"" was informed as much by the film's ambiguity and contradictions as by its shocks and relentless, unflinching perspective; here was a film that had a reputation for being one of the Baddest Mothers to play the grindhouse circuit, but was, in reality, a film also inclined toward the kind of contemplative, introspective moments you'd find in a film by Bergman or Antonioni (yes, I said it). Needless to say, I found the revulsion leveled against it both justified and over-the-top; I took greater issue with Zarchi's inexplicable desire to play all sides: the faultless female protagonist (the luminous Camille Keaton) who is brutally violated by four misogynist -- yet also maddeningly innocuous -- hoods who seem to represent the very worst manifestation of inexplicable sexual rage. Despite this, ""Spit"" remains a fascinating, one-of-a-kind work, which makes the notion of a remake something even more curious: while the fan opinion of Today seems to have balanced the scales against the critical opinion of Then, Zarchi's film remains best-known as the film Roger Ebert derided as the worst of all time.By some strange feat, director Steven R. Monroe and writer Stuart Morse have given ""Spit"" a modern face-lift that improves and expands upon the original film, provides clearer character motivation (not to mention more development), and settles into acts of revenge that are jaw-dropping in their audacity, yet strangely justified in their torture-porn excesses. While Zarchi trafficked in predictable payoffs distinguished by geysers of gore, Morse scripts scenes of torture so florid that they border on the abstractly poetic (while hanging on by a delicate string of credibility throughout). The rapists here are three-dimensional nightmares of liquor-slugging (yet backwoods-smart) horniness, and our female protagonist (Sarah Butler, in a performance as courageous as Keaton's) finds the perfect balance between fear and intimidation; empowerment and hellfire vengeance. The plot is suspenseful and largely unpredictable (even during the first act, which uses Zarchi's script as a template but goes into even more grueling, horrifying terrain of negative anticipation), though ""Spit Redux"" sometimes flinches when it should push its excesses that much further (the actual rape is truncated, illuminating contemporary popular attitudes toward sexual violence in film). And some of the machinations of the last act stretch credibility in terms of character consistency. Still, ""I Spit on Your Grave"" is a remake as potent as ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" ""Dawn of the Dead,"" and ""Halloween"" -- an electrifying reminder of just how potent and ugly the filmed image can be (and that's a compliment).7.5 out of 10",I Spit on Your Grave

The film builds nicely (or horribly), to increase tension. The sadistic teasing is drawn out to make it exceptionally uncomfortable. If anything, the beginning is too unsettling. Monroe handles the rape scene well, but it isn't as appalling as some of the previous acts. The vengeance carried out is done in a fairly clever way. It's fist pumping feminist revenge fantasy, but gruesome enough to not make us completely sympathize with her. The big problem the film has is no character arc. Sure, it's interesting to see the power shift between the characters. The woman becoming an ass kicking angel of vengeance and the men left as quivering wrecks. Yet, we only see her vanish and then reappear. She becomes so inhuman, and so adept at offing people, she is presented as some kind of super action hero, which makes her hard to relate to.

In Brazil, even in the most remote cities we have this kind of police investigation.

Revenge movies usually have good endings and leave the spectator happy, but I have to snitch that ""Double Jeopardy"" is a better film of this subject-- albeit not being that gory and agonizing to see.

While there she runs into some unfriendly young men, who brutalize her physically and sexually. They leave her for dead in a river, raped and beaten. She shows up alive and vengeful. The stupidity of the original is cleverly ignored here. She used her sexuality to lure the men in the original, the same men who just raped and woman and left her to die. Would they really be stupid enough to fall for that crap? Here, she simply takes them by surprise and tortures them. To a degree of 'I need to look away'. There was one scene for me in which I cringed a bit, so bravo on that front. I'll never look at fish hooks and birds the same again. The problem the film fails to fix is the mentally handicapped character and his resolution. There is some debate about whether or not he should have died or lived in the end, I won't spoil things for those wanting to see, but I will say that I certainly believe that she chose the wrong option here. The film has some pacing issues, but the content is brutal enough to make you think, or make you cheer. Bravo to Sarah Butler who braves the role, she bares herself on screen and is humiliated. The rape scene is nowhere near as graphic or violent as the original, or even the Last House On The Left remake, but she still deserves and applause for taking on such a role. The original is a failure, and this one corrects those mistakes.",I Spit on Your Grave
50,lewiskendell,"Monstrous violence, monstrous revenge.",7,11 February 2011,"""Tell me again how sorry you are.""I Spit on Your Grave is a remake of a vicious revenge/horror movie for the late 70's, when these kinds of movie were much more common. It's a brutal movie that some people will outright hate, but if you like seeing truly despicable people getting much deserved payback for their actions, you might want to give it a shot.  Jennifer (Sarah Butler) is a young writer who rents a cabin in an isolated wooded area for a few months, in order to work in peace and quiet. She's attacked and terrorized by a group of sadistic rednecks that she had a run-in with earlier, and narrowly escapes to what she thinks is safety...only to end up in a much worse situation. She eventually gets away from them, but only after the group has horrifically assaulted her. They think she's dead, and they don't learn differently until she has already begun getting vengeance on them one by one. I really hope Sarah Butler gets to star in many (perhaps more pleasant) movies in the future, because she's a pretty good actress. These  movies demanded the full gamut of emotions from her, and she delivered. The whole cast was good, but most of the other characters only had to worry about portraying various degrees of evil, pain, or terror. Lots and lots of evil, pain, or terror. Like I said before, I Spit on your Grave is definitely not for everyone. The initial attack on Jennifer is truly horrible, and the deaths she visits on those responsible are absolutely gruesome. It's not as difficult to watch as the recent remake of the somewhat similar Last House on the Left, though. It's also a better movie, overall.",I Spit on Your Grave

But the movie is so cheaply made, you only see how goofy and over the top the gore is. I know I wasn't supposed to, but the revenge part made me laugh. It was too much. Zero tension, only the unintentionally funny aspect of the executions, stood out. As satisfying as some of it might have been (the sheriff, obviously). I'm not a big fan of the way it was handled. And how they would explain all these gruesome murders, once bodies will be found. So it lacked credibility and a real buildup too. But I guess it wasn't the point, was it? I haven't seen the original movie, so I can't really complain about this remake not being as good as this one. One thing's for sure, it's not memorable, and certainly not a good « revenge movie ». As the heroine lacked depth and complexity. And in the end, the way she seeks revenge is anything but cathartic.",I Spit on Your Grave

54,Pumpkin_Man,Better and Gorier Than the Original!!!,7,19 July 2018,"I watched both the 1978 version and the remake today. To me, this was the better movie because I liked Jennifer's revenge better. In this one, she's more sadistic and psychotic, like setting up traps and torturing her attackers and watching them suffer. Jennifer Hills is an author from New York who goes to a cabin in Louisiana in hopes of peace and quiet to work on her new book. Soon enough, three rednecks and their mentally challenged friend show up and begin to violate and attack her. I hate rape, so I had to fast forward during that scene. When the guys think she's dead, a month goes by and they start receiving messages like a dead bird, and a flip-flop Jennifer was wearing. One by one, she attacks and tortures every one of them. It's brutal, but very satisfying! If you like revenge stories and the controversial original, you may enjoy I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE!!!",I Spit on Your Grave
55,educallejero,"Exploitative yes, but really good!",6,11 September 2018,"It's vile. It's graphic. The characters are one note (It's a simple and violent revenge fantasy movie). That's all part of the package. If you decide to watch it, you should be prepared for it.There are fair criticisms for this movie though: (SPOILERS)
-While the start of the movie (which includes the rape) is awkwardly realistic; the survival and revenge aren't. They show a montage of her working out as a reason for her to be ridiculously strong. That's all poorly justified, sure.
-They didn't even try to explain how she survived in a forest, alone and naked. That's lazy (and unrealistic).
-The plot hole of her family/friend asking for her wasn't solved as much as it was just dropped. Also kind of lazy.BUT the movie looks pretty good. The acting is kind of great. The dialogue good enough. And the ""Saw-type"" traps that she uses to get revenge at her rapists are insane, with each one relating exactly to things that characterized the scumbags that raped her.On the debate if this is ""man hating"", ""it glorifies violence against women"" or ""pro woman"", I'm pretty sure women have the right to decide this, but I'm also definitely sure of another thing: It's not man hating.",I Spit on Your Grave
56,gregsrants,Worst Date Movie of 2010,7,20 August 2010,"In 1978, Roger Ebert declared I Spit on Your Grave as ""The worst movie ever made"". Wow. Harsh words from arguably the most respected film critic to ever roam the earth. The film starred Camille Keaton as an aspiring writer that is raped and left for dead by four men whom she exacts her revenge. It may not have been the first female revenge film, but sure was one of the more memorable ones, and to this day it is still banned in various countries throughout the world.Thirty plus years later, I began reading that an update to the 1978 cult classic was looking to go into production. I suppose it was one of the last remaining films from the era that has yet to have a new glossy look now that The Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes have been checked off Hollywood's new To-Do List.Sarah Butler steps into the Jennifer Mills role as the victim who exacts her revenge on the men who brutally torment and assail her. Her fury releasing vengeance will make Keaton's Mills look like a girl scout while leaving audiences either cheering or peeking through their fingers to stomach what's next in store when the baddies become the victims.My first curiosity when heading out to the Toronto After Dark Festival to see the screening of the 2010 update was wondering how they were going to match the cruelty and viciousness of the original rape scene. That now infamous DVD chapter lasted over 20 minutes and consisted of enough full female nudity to garnish an NC-17 rating by today's standards. Surely, director Steven R. Monroe would be unable to match the reboot's predecessor and still get a wide enough release to make some money at the box office. More on that in just a moment.The update follows the same story arc as the original. Jennifer travels to a remote cabin in the deep woods to work on her novel. She stops at a gas station where she meets hick individuals that will show up at the cabin later and repeatedly rape and beat her initiated by the ringleader Johnny (Jeff Branson). Sheriff Storch (Andrew Howard) also wants a piece of the action and turns the tables on Jennifer when she looks for support from the lawman. Even the town idiot, the mentally challenged Matthew (Chad Lindberg) is represented. Each will take a turn raping the helpless writer in an evening of sheer nightmares that will surely unsettle stable audiences.Trying to match the intensity of the rape in the original would seem impossible, but director Monroe does a great job of having the assailants appear menacing (the original failed in comparison) and not shortcutting his way through the assault to get to the vengeful violence that is the film's staple.After the extensive scenes of abuse and humiliation, Jennifer stumbles through the forest then falls into the river right before Stroch has the opportunity to shoot her with his shotgun. As the five men look down into the river, Jennifer's body does not rise above the water and the men panic in an attempt to find their victim and confirm her death.Fast forward a short but undeterminable amount of time, and Jennifer reappears. At first, she emerges back at the cabin where the conflicted Matthew was hiding in his guilt. She seems calm, yet distant and coerces Matthew to sit with her on the couch before she grabs a noose and chokes the helpless half-wit.This will be the launch of Jennifer's vengeance. Over the final reels of the film, she will entrap each of her rapists one-by-one and extract her own type of justice.To have any of the scenes of torture revealed in a review would be an injustice. This film needs to be experienced in all its gruesome and graphic glory to be appreciated for the genre it represents. But what we will reveal is that her tools of torturous trade will include nooses, water, lye, fish hooks and fishing wire, a bear trap, garden shears, dead rats, dead fish, birds (dead and alive), a shotgun, pliers and plenty of rope. Before she is done teeth, eyes, faces, asses, chests and yes, one penis that is fed back to the victim will have their cringe inducing moments.Out of all the reboots that have eaten up my box office dollars over the past few years, I Spit on Your Grave was the most satisfying and the best representation of what a reboot should encompass. It was brutal and relentless, but also stayed true to the characters and the original film so as to not reinvent the wheel.One thing for certain – I Spit on Your Grave is not for everyone. My girlfriend left about half way through the film as the on screen pain and suffering were too much for her to bear. And a gentleman in the balcony section of the downtown Bloor cinema fainted and had to receive quick medical attention. You can't buy that kind of publicity.If you are looking for a good, violent and straight forward revenge flick that has a gorgeous naked woman mowing down her attackers, then this is right up your alley. But be warned. Taking the most memorable ideas from films like Irreversible and Hostel and putting them together in the same film makes I Spit on Your Grave the true 'Worst Date Movie' of 2010.Wonder what Ebert thinks.www.killerreviews.com",I Spit on Your Grave

It's an unrepentant torture porn cum revenge movie, and it gives few quarters. The story follows on from where our lead lady after being brutally tortured raped by a group of locals (rednecks!) manages to survive the ordeal and is out for some serious revenge. Nothing original in it and it's a brutal ride that seems to push certain boundaries of taste. However there have been more disturbing and nasty movies so won't be creating too much mass public mock outrage, although this is not dilute when it does get going.If you've a weak stomach you won't be giving this a go anyhow (so walk away), and the title makes it clear what type of film it is in any case so no one should bother who can't take the genre.

Furthermore, good dialogue reveals much about a character; the better the characters, the better the movie. This movie's dialogue was not it's strongest point; it is unfortunately not a strong point period. There aren't any big name stars in this one and the performances are not as convincing as I hoped for. At times, the movie seems to drag on and you wish it would speed up; usually not a good sign. The story is one of an extreme revenge and the title aptly fits. You find yourself rooting for the victim when she starts her revenge spree because she was cruelly abused, but some of her wrath is more cruel than vengeful and that lack of measure is not tasteful. Not an awful movie, not too bad either but as revenge movies go, it's miles and miles behind Kill Bill; if there are packs of movies in the revenge genre behind Kill Bill, this one would not be in the leading pack.",I Spit on Your Grave

What we have also is a corrupt cop, also involved in Jennifer's rape. Again oblivious to the fact, Jennifer's alive, she returns forth bloody vengeance on her attackers, in some very original and bloody ways. You'll love how the cop buys it.

63,richieandsam,A remake actually worth watching.,7,20 September 2013,"I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVEThe movie is about a writer that goes on a little break in a cabin to do some writing. While she is there she get's brutally raped, beaten and left for dead by a group of local lads. What they don't realise, is she survived and comes back for revenge.I know it sounds like a typical horror movie, and in many ways it is, but this film is really horrible.I have seen the original movie... in fact I have the uncut version of DVD... it is a sick film that I actually feel uncomfortable watching. I like it a lot... it is well made and very gritty. But the rape scenes were horrible to watch.So... 32 years later, Hollywood decides to remake this, just like every classic movie. Was I expecting to like the remake? No. Did I like it? Yes. It was actually surprising good.The rape scenes were again very uncomfortable to watch. It was not as awkward to watch as the original, but it was still horrible enough to make me believe the girl was really going through hell.The acting was very good throughout the movie. I believed everything I watched. The gang of rapists were really believable in their roles that you actually hate them. Jeff Branson was great as the leader. He was so horrible. I wanted him to die so badly. Other cast members were Andrew Howard, Daniel Franzese, Rodney Eastman and Chad Lindberg. They all did a good job. But the main character and the star of the film was definitely Sarah Butler. Sarah played the victim, and she does a fantastic job. I felt so bad for her. I hope she gets a lot more work in the future.Mostly this was a complete remake of the original. There were a few changes though, but not many. There were a couple of extra characters added, one of which was the sheriff. The other big change from the original was her revenge. The killings were much more inventive this time around.The original didn't have much of a budget, and that is what gave it the feel it had. The gritty, realistic, scary feel. The remake had a budget and you could clearly see that. That is why this film felt like a typical horror.Finally, this film has a lot of predictability about it. There were a few twists in the film, but I saw them coming a mile off.All in all, this has to be one of the better remakes I have seen. I enjoyed it and will be watching I Spit on Your Grave 2 soon... but I don't hold out much hope on that one.

Remake of the dreadful 1978 Day of the Woman: A writer is raped and brutalized at her cabin retreat and left for dead - but she lives and seeks revenge against the men who attacked her.The two things that I deeply hate in movies has to be Mindless blood and gore and Rape, and this movie is the full bag of those two. The reason why I watched this because...well I never heard of this film before. I heard a lot of people talk about it and what I heard wasn't very positive. When I watched the film I couldn't help to ask the one question, who enjoys this? seriously who in hell enjoys this graphic, torture porn of mess.I Spit on Your Grave made me feel dirty inside, like I'm covered in muddy dirt that's everywhere around me.When the main character dose get her revenge on them who cause such pain to her. I didn't really give a fuss about her character wining towards the end. It just felt so rushed and if you showed her recover after what happened to her and show about days going by as she trying to deal of what just happened to her then I can see her turning into torture murder herself. But in this her character start's of sweet and harmless, and then out of no where she turns into a killer who looks like she killed most of her life. That's just bad writing.The movie has some good shots of the open view of the lakes where the girl is staying and the wide shots in the movie, but the rest sucks. Bad directing, horrible writing and dreadful acting. Oh and by the way I'm not seeing the second one. Why you my ask? because I'm sick and tried of seeing these horror films with mindless torture porn and rape in it, who the hell enjoys that.Overall I Spit on Your Grave has to be the worst remake I've seen since well the other bad horror remakes in the past.

66,nitzanhavoc,"Sweet, sweet vengeance. I only wish it was longer!",10,8 May 2013,"Most Horror films, especially those involving many gore scenes of blood and severed organs, make the viewer experience the horror by torturing the protagonist with whom the viewer sympathizes. It's sort of a masochistic kind of fun, made for a very specific and esoteric kind of audience. I Spit on Your Grave is very different. In this case, the aforementioned is only true for the first part of the film, as we see (as described in the synopsis) a young girl being brutally humiliated, assaulted and raped by a bunch of stereotypical redneck hicks. It's brutal, vicious, and evil and is not for the faint of heart. However, the second part of the film is surprisingly enjoyable. Imagine being starved for 3 days, only to then be presented with the meal of your dreams. That's pretty much how it felt. Now the poor woman becomes the merciless hunter, and brutally punishes those who have wronged her so, hurting each of them in a way similar to that they hurt her. The catharsis is immense, and it's beautiful.This kind of a revenge film does not appeal to the viewer's logic or sense of reality, but to their basic emotions and concept of true justice. Think of how fun it is to watch films about comic strips vigilantes like The Punisher, and multiply it by one billion. This time, perhaps the most terrible thing a person could do to another is graphically shown, and then graphically avenged in a perfect way. It's almost inhumanly sick, and as we watch it, we know it's wrong, we know that girl is being a feral savage and almost an animal. And we cheer her through it, hoping it never ends. We smile as the sadistic rapists suffer unspeakable pain, and pray for a few more minutes of this glorious feeling. As I've said - beautiful.The screenplay is great and perfect for this type of revenge film, though from what I've understood the credit goes to the writer of the original ""Day of The Woman"" film. Direction and cinematography are also great, showing us just enough shocking footage, without stepping too boldly over the line. The acting is excellent, the entire cast has done a great job. I've been especially impressed with lead actress Sarah Butler and with Chad Lundberg as the mentally challenged Mathew. Everything fits together like a beautifully sickening puzzle.Some people might resent this film, thinking it's nothing more than cheap gore and cheap thrills. It's all a matter of taste and opinion. I for one have really, really enjoyed it. I managed to pull through the first part, and enjoyed every second of the rest. With such a sensitive theme, I'm one of those who understand that seven lifetimes in prison wouldn't have been a harsh enough punishment for the worthless beings who've committed such a crime. In a perfect world, we'd let rape victims do the same to their assailants. And we'd be happy about it.If you have a strong enough stomach, if you enjoy well deserved and well served vengeance, and if you're not ashamed to be only human - I'd very highly recommend this film to you. I, personally, have watched it twice already, and can guarantee there will be a third. I rarely rate a film 10, as I always try to remain impartial and objective. In this case - a perfect 10, as I also rarely enjoy films to such an extent. You're still reading? I'm flattered. Now go watch the film! :)",I Spit on Your Grave

69,bob_meg,Takes a wreck of an original and actually makes a decent movie out of it,9,12 March 2011,"I can name a handful of remakes that are either as good or slightly better than their originals. This, however, is the first incidence I can think of where the remake tops the original AND the original was never that great to begin with. I'm sure all the ISOYG '78 fanboys will disagree, but for every good thing Meir Zarchi brought to his original venture (some interesting ideas on framing and POV shots) there were three or four unmissable loogies (substandard acting, dismal photography, jarring editing, ridiculous nonsensical storyline, etc. etc.). It's one of those ""cult"" films that got its status simply by being ""provocative."" And I never bought the load of hooey that Zarchi likes to haul out when '78 is attacked --- that ISOYG is actually a feminist manifesto. It's too crudely executed for that; it can't decide whether it's an exploitation porno or an Eye For an Eye call to arms regarding violence against women. It wants to be both, does neither well, generally failing all around.What's really surprising about the 2010 remake is that it literally takes everything that was wrong about the first version, and rights it: either with stellar acting, great production, or a script that goes beyond coherence and into good writing territory.As many here have pointed out, if you are not a fan of violence on screen or have no stomach for the evil that really does go on...avoid this movie at all costs. This isn't one you're going to watch with your parents, in all likelihood. On the other hand, the Tormenting/Rape portion of this version goes by a lot faster than the original, simply because it's got a good script with a lot of interesting plot devices. There were long stretches in the original where the goons literally just stood around chuckling at Camille Keaton for minutes at a time --- the kind of stuff you'd see in a home movie (if you lived in a psycho ward, of course). At the same time, this portion will make you squirm a bit more because the emotional violence is the focus in 2010 --- the original literally seemed like a half hour rapefest.The addition of the sheriff character could have been a real boner if not for the menace and mesmerizing vileness Alan Howard brings to the character (ditto for almost all the guys, especially Jeff Branson, who communicates a primitive hatred for women quite chillingly). And it was always stupid in the original to believe Camille Keaton would actually SEDUCE the same guys who raped her just to lure them into her revenge traps. In the 2010 version, Sarah Butler leisurely toys with the men in a stalkerish fashion, layering on the psychological torment, just as they did to her.And that's something else that really makes this version --- Butler's performance as Jennifer Hills. First, she actually establishes her character in the opening scenes; Camille Keaton was an automaton even BEFORE her trauma in the '78 pic. Butler really makes her torment excruciating from almost every emotional angle possible, and that puts you so much more ""on her side"" as opposed to Keaton's robotron cardboard action-figure turn. There are times when she appears to NOT be enjoying herself too much in the payback sequences, and many times when her wrecked emotional landscape is very visible. At the end, she looks far from emotionally ""recovered."" No, five wrongs don't make a right.And yes, the Revenge portion of the movie is miles more brutal, way more effective, and not too logically out of the ballpark. The '78 version had more straightforward believable kills, but I'm sorry --- the levels these guys go to in this movie deserves absolutely no mercy. The script also works many gyrations to ensure that each is paid back in a way appropriate to the character's torment of Jennifer.Does that justify all the on screen rape and degradation? Probably not...I wouldn't want to live in a world where just anyone could turn on network TV and watch this stuff. But, if you're a consenting adult and want an ultra-violent revenge horror film that's well-written and executed, at least ISOYG '10 does it right.",I Spit on Your Grave

71,squeezebox,I Spit on Your Remake (Because it SUCKS),1,8 April 2011,"The ONLY positive thing that can be said about the remake of I Spit on Your Grave is that it has made me realize how good the original is. I never liked Meir Zarchi's rape-revenge shocker, but I now can appreciate it for the gritty, basic thriller that it is. Remakes are almost always pointless, but in horror cinema, remakes are an opportunity new filmmakers to polish, upgrade and outdo the original. In attempting this, director Steven Monroe has more or less made a movie which lives up to the unfair negative press the original received. In other words, it is a movie which is misogynistic, exploitative and far sleazier than the the original.Jennifer Hills (Sarah Butler) is an independent young woman who has rented a cabin in the wilderness to write a book. She gets unwanted attention from the local rednecks who eventually attack and rape her. After enduring several hours of sexual assault, she wanders off, lays low for a while, then takes violent, poetic revenge on her attackers in various gruesome ways.Sounds pretty similar to the original plot-wise. So what are the significant differences that make this movie so horrendously awful? First, the character of Jennifer is turned from an average, likable young woman into a smoking hot model who also happens to be kind of a bitch. I found the character to be pretty obnoxious. It doesn't mean she deserves what happens to her, but making me not like her made it that much harder to care about her.Secondly, the rape scenes, while not outright glorifying the rapes, are far more exploitative than the scenes in the original. My biggest gripe about them is the attempt to make sure Butler always looks attractive before, during and after the rape scenes. In the original, Camille Keaton looked like she'd been run over by a truck. Despite being completely naked there was nothing sexy about her appearance whatsoever. On the other hand, Monroe makes sure there's not TOO much dirt and blood on Butler's face and body, as he wants to make sure she still looks at least a LITTLE sexy. There's a conspicuous effort to get as many shots of her ass on screen as possible - and to make sure it always looks cute.Third, the ridiculous revenge scenes. Here's where the movie basically stops being a remake of I Spit on Your Grave and becomes a rip off of SAW. Apparently being raped and beaten has shocked Jennifer into suddenly becoming an expert in the engineering of Medieval torture devices. Whereas she seduced and killed her attackers in somewhat plausible ways in the original (except maybe for the over-the-top outboard motor disembowelment), here her revenge is pure fantasy. She sets up absurdly elaborate mechanisms to torture and eventually kill her attackers. And the movie is so eager to hurry up and get to the third act bloodbath it leaves inexcusable pot holes unresolved.I Spit on Your Grave UNRATED (as it is proudly titled) is not just one of the worst remakes I've seen, it's one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. It's a waste of time and energy for all involved including the audience. Once again, in their attempt to make the ""sickest movie ever made,"" a group of filmmakers have succeeded only in making a movie that is trite, boring and stupid.Skip it.",I Spit on Your Grave
72,jhpstrydom,Definitely a classic film of its genre.,8,15 April 2011,"Out of the many violent films I've seen from the notorious french horrors FRONTIER(S), INSIDE and MARTYRS, to the very disturbing JACK KETCHUM'S THE GIRL NEXT DOOR, there is only one film that makes a greater impact than all of them and that is the 2010 remake of I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, even though its also very violent and extremely disturbing, its the only one that really gets you thinking.For instance say you as a woman were the victim of the kind of torture depicted in this film or you as a man had a girlfriend who was raped by these types of men in this film and when it gets to the part where Jennifer starts to exact her revenge, would the acts of revenge in this film be the kind of ordeal you'd want to put the people responsible through? Because I'm sure every single person at some point in their lives have plotted a form of revenge against the people that did them wrong and that's what this film is, a story about a woman that was humiliated, beaten, tortured and raped and that exacts the kind of revenge that anyone who was put through something like this would exact, some of the scenes few people might say are far fetched but so are some people's ideas and most of all, if you heard the person responsible for your whole ordeal start to beg and plead for his life, would you show sympathy or would you remember when you begged and pleaded for them to stop when they never did? This film hits all these notes and believe it or not if you really look at it certain way, you'd be asking yourself these same questions and I'm sure that even Roger Ebert who gave the film zero stars has also at one stage in his life plotted revenge against someone.Overall, its ten times the film the original was and it is thought provoking in the most unique way, definitely a classic film of its genre.",I Spit on Your Grave
73,PoisonKeyblade,Savage and unrelenting.. utterly excellent.,10,22 September 2010,"Remakes of horror classics can easily make people angry, unless of course they find some way to improve on the original or just take the story in a completely different direction. I Spit On Your Grave, the newest in a long line of horror remakes takes a cue from some of the greats like last year's The Last House on the Left and 2003's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (among many others) in changing the movie's original story into a slightly more complex but awesome gritty thrill ride with plenty of intense gore scenes and deeply intense moments to go around. The remake is directed by Steven R. Monroe from a script by Stuart Morse, and starring in the production are Sarah Butler, Chad Lindberg, Daniel Franzese, Jeff Branson, Rodney Eastman, and Andrew Howard, most of whom are relatively unknown and do very competent jobs in their respective roles.Going deep into seclusion to stay at a cabin and work on her newest novel, Jennifer Hills (Butler) expects a quiet few months in the middle of nowhere. After a brief run-in with a few folks from town, she is assaulted in her home and savagely raped, then left for dead. The bulk of the film deals with the aftermath of this event and Jennifer's fight to get revenge on those who wronged her.Having just watched the original, it was a real treat to see how much the filmmakers really put into giving it justice. There are several scenes that are lifted from the original, but this remake adds so many modern aspects to the plot that almost every inch of it is something fresh. I loved how the ending was a perfect wink to the original, although this one goes out on a much more awesome note.While the original had a few plot holes and some inconsistencies as well as a lack of any real edge-of-your-seat suspense, the final act of this remake pumps it into full gear with some superb kill scenes. The violence is incredibly extreme and admittedly made me cringe more than a few times. While the original's kills were less about the gore and more about the simplicity, the brutality of this remake never seems to hold back. Probably the most brutal of all is the ultimate ode to the most famous death scene in the original, which I won't mention here for fear of spoiling it for the uninitiated. The particular scene made me slightly queasy, but it's extremely effective.The female empowerment quotient that is so obvious and evident in the original is all the more powerful here; the audience almost has to question if the sort of overly sadistic torture that Jennifer grants her victims has been rightfully deserved. So much exposition is added to the story that it makes us care much more for Jennifer and root for her as soon as she comes back a bit later in the picture. The introduction to our characters and the subsequent horrors is a very great one; there are many great camera angles utilized, as our director clearly has skills behind the camera.The acting has very few holes and was actually pretty impressive. While few of these actors have been seen in major studio productions, they all manage to impress and mostly shatter audience expectations. Sarah Butler delivers her lines with a sarcastic witty nuance that few actresses with as little experience would have been able to pull off effectively. The hillbillies are all particularly horrific, but it's Jeff Branson that really shines here. He has massive charisma on the screen, and several scene-stealing lines throughout the movie. It's a shame he hasn't had the chance to do more with his career yet, but I easily see a bright future ahead for him. The rest of the cast is not without their own respective merits, and they carry the film's crisp runtime easily on their shoulders.This movie was above and beyond one of the best horror films so far this year. It's incredibly brutal and deeply controversial with its depictions of death and rape, but it's message is a very interesting one. The acting and direction are exceedingly perfect and the movie's final act is sure to be remembered. To say it surpasses the original movie by a country mile would not be inaccurate; I Spit On Your Grave is a hugely entertaining and outrageous thrill ride.",I Spit on Your Grave
74,MovieGuy01,Wow....This was even better than the original film,7,26 February 2011,"I found the remake of I Spit On Your Grave to be even more brutal than the original 1978 film. It is about a young woman writer Jennifer Hills (Sara Butler)who decides to take a break from the city for a while, so she takes a trip to a quite cabin in the woods to start work on her next book. She drops over at a local gas station on the way there. whist there she meets a groups of guys that seem to be attracted to her. When arriving back at her cabin in the woods, she finds that her cabin has been broken into. all of a sudden she finds the four guys in her cabin. they begin to start humiliating and intimidating her really badly. Jennifer somehow manages to escape away from the men. They try to look for her, but finds no sign of her As the time passes, the men stop searching for her body. Unknown to them Jennifer is still alive and she wants to get her own back on the men torturing them using terrible and horrifying ways. I found this film to be much like the original 1978 version, but with much more brutal and violent scenes in it. It was tough to watch the torture Jennifer put on the men. but it was an excellent film overall I give: 7/10",I Spit on Your Grave
75,AndyVanScoyoc,Did I watch a different movie? What's with all the glowing reviews?,5,26 September 2019,"This movie wasn't bad, it was just ridiculous, to a degree, once it got to the rape scene.The first rape scene was at least believable. After that, it's like someone had no clue what they were doing.If you're going to make a supposedly sick film... the sickest ever made, then research rape.OBVIOUSLY no one bothered to research anal rape.With anal sex, unless you're used to it you're lucky if you can walk afterward.This was supposedly her first time (the sickos talk about how ""tight"" she was) yet the victim gets up, little behind still intact...no blood - at all ...anywhere except where the Sheriff hit her in the face.There'd have been blood on her body... and I doubt she'd have just stood upright like nothing happened.Yet she just gets up with no problem and saunters off with just a few twitches, swan diving into a disgusting river where she is able to become a mermaid obviously and swim away.The revenge scenes were MUCH better than the rape scenes but too quick and unsatisfying.I'm not into torture porn...I'm really not, but if you're going to bother, do it right and make it worth MY time.If you're going to hype a film to be something...it had better live up to it.This was like watered down milk. While not a waste, I won't recommend it.",I Spit on Your Grave
76,loomis78-815-989034,From the bottom of a soul,5,17 April 2015,"Remake of the notorious 1978 film of the same title, that doesn't waver much from the original in content, just updated. Jennifer Hills (Butler) is a hottie from the big city who rents a cabin by a lake in the middle of Hicksville USA. She's there to write a book and immediately has a run in with three local idiots and their slow friend Matthew (Lindberg) who obviously has never heard about women's lib or equality. To them she is a piece of ass and only that. They spy on her for a while and one night they just walk in and proceed to terrorize and eventually take turns at raping her. She somehow escapes and walking through the woods in shock and nude from the waist down she runs into the local sheriff Storch (Howard) who is out hunting. Thinking she's safe he brings her right back to the Cabin and ends up being part of the gang taking his turn. Knowing they can't have a witness they are about to shoot Jennifer until she drops into the lake and disappears. They think they're in the clear, but Jennifer has survived and one by one plans a horrific fate for each member that tops what happened to her. This is a really well made movie by Director Steven R. Monroe with an outstanding performance by Sarah Butler as the unlucky Jennifer. The shocking subject matter once it starts, never stops. The violence is brutal and nasty and very hard to watch. It's hard to enjoy watching a movie like this (just like the original) because it is truly horrific. If you can sit through the subject matter you will feel some twinges of redemption as Jennifer starts her revenge killing spree. The men in this movie are so despicable that the audience members that can bear the lengthy attack on Jennifer will no doubt enjoy her revenge. Just like the original, you have to make the decision before hand if you want to watch the true bottom of the human soul in action.",I Spit on Your Grave
77,happyendingrocks,"If you're looking for a 45-minute rape scene, stick to the original; if you're looking for an actual movie, this is the version to see",8,15 June 2012,"Of all the infamous grindhouse offerings of the genre's past, I can't think of a film I'm less interested in revisiting than Meir Zarchi's reprehensible cavalcade of misogyny I Spit On Your Grave. When I heard a remake was in the works, I decided long before it was even released that nothing in the world could compel me to sit through a rehash of the horrendous atrocity catalog that Zarchi had the gall to present as a legitimate piece of art in 1978. The original I Spit On Your Grave sickens me to my very core every time I think about it, and while I hope my review history will clearly show that I have no aversions to controversial material, the pure malevolence of Zarchi's voyeuristic rapist daydream has always struck me as an irresponsible juxtaposition of sex and violence that seems to exist for the sole purpose of titillating viewers who enjoy watching women be abused and degraded under the guise of ""entertainment."" It was sheer morbid curiosity and a bargain-priced Blu Ray that led me to reluctantly give I Spit On Your Grave version 2.0 a look, and while I wasn't looking forward to the viewing experience, I have always imagined that this story could function as a thought-provoking and visceral revenge narrative if placed in the right hands. It turns out my speculation was correct.This is not an easy film to watch, nor should it be, but every aspect of this remake is a drastic improvement on the inept, bargain basement torture porn of the original. The tone is grittier and more realistic, the characters are well rendered and portrayed, and the film as a whole eschews settling for a knuckle-dragging pure exploitation approach and sets its sights much higher. The '70s Spit never resembled a horror film, it was just horrible, but this re-imagining configures the same scenario into a tense and suspenseful morality tale that is less about a woman being repeatedly raped by a gang of goons and more about a band of cretins who participate in a reprehensible act and end up being haunted and stalked by their victim until they are forced to suffer the consequences of their horrendous deed.The prolonged rape itself is once again displayed in graphic, unflinching detail, but director Steven R. Monroe also shows admirable restraint, and he's able to create just as shocking an impression as Zarchi did without dwelling on the unsavory assault for longer than is necessary to get the point across. Zarchi's version featured a continuous visualization that occupied nearly half of the 1978 Spit's run-time, but Monroe is apparently intelligent enough to realize that the audience doesn't need to see each of the despicable neanderthals have their turn for us to grasp how savage and demeaning the violation we're witnessing is. The presentation here is far more effective, providing an indisputable impetus for us to submit to the events that follow while also sparing us an underhanded glorification of the loathsome details.All of the performances are excellent, but Sarah Butler's lead turn is absolutely stunning. Zarchi's clueless hand guided original Jennifer Hills portrayer Camille Keaton to go about her vengeful business in a blasé manner and deliver her lines as if she was ordering a sandwich, but Butler is a furious dynamo, capably channeling the rage we know her character is harboring as she dispatches her tormentors one by one. Butler's intensity as she inflicts unspeakable injuries upon her deserving targets is devastating and frightening, and handily underscores the violent reprisals she's meting out.Of course, the revenge angle is supposed to be the driving force of the film, and on that front, the modern-day Spit doles out a series of punishments that will test the boundaries and gorges of even the most seasoned horror fan. The comeuppances orchestrated by Zarchi in 1978 were largely underwhelming and unfolded in such a brief and unspectacular fashion that they felt like afterthoughts, and one of the most tasteless aspects of the original I Spit On Your Grave was the victimized Jennifer opting to seduce each of her rapists, presenting the impression that she ultimately enjoyed what happened to her. Monroe's Jennifer is far less demure, and her specialty is trapping and torturing her prey as she tailors a demise specifically modeled after the atrocity they inflicted upon her. I won't divulge any specifics, but suffice to say that every single bit of clever vengeance she doles out here is incredibly graphic and heinous.The film also wisely deviates from its moronic source material at times, and the incorporation of a few unexpected new elements provides some twists for those familiar with the original, while subsequently augmenting the bleak and misanthropic vision of the piece.Spit 2.0 succeeds on every front that Zarchi's undeservedly venerated exploitation vehicle resoundingly failed, and in doing so it becomes a rare remake that doesn't merely outshine its predecessor, it handily displays how mindless and ultimately abominable the original is. Granted, it's not terribly hard to improve upon the absolute sleaziest bit of filth ever excreted into the film lexicon, but this incarnation of I Spit On Your Grave is such a surprisingly powerful and disturbing outing that it should be considered mandatory viewing for anyone with the stomach for the material.",I Spit on Your Grave
78,rlaine,"Quite good, except for the last act",7,20 March 2013,"I haven't seen the original and I'm not that much into modern ""horror"" movies. I decided to give this a chance anyway, because this had such a good score and it was on in the movie channel. I was prepared to stop watching at some point, because lately I've found so many ""horror"" movies to go into the ""torture porn"" territory that I don't want to watch.The ratings weren't really wrong, this was a pretty good movie compared to quite a few I've seen. I'm just not 100 % sure I'm giving it credit for the same reasons as everyone else. Reading the reviews here it seems as if most think the revenge part is what makes this movie. I on the other hand think the finale, or the last act, was a let down.Two thirds of this movie is quite good. What makes this movie special in my eyes, is that the so called bad guys are given proper screen time, actually even more than the woman. After the bad guys have done what they did, the focus turns to them completely. How do they get away with it? You see the story evolve from their perspective. Despite the fact that there is a prolonged rape scene and some seriously disturbing gore images, the most striking scene is probably when the sheriff goes home for the first time. You realize he has a lovely daughter, a pregnant wife and a cozy home and since the acting is really good thru out, you really feel it. Did the ""baddies"" just get carried away or are they complete psychos, this is something that the movie couldn't necessarily take it's side with. It portrays the bad guys as both, on the other hand they are harmless slackers and a seemingly respectable family man, but on the other hand they are capable of horrible deeds. You don't really know if they had a history of violence and abuse, at least it wasn't emphasized.I just watched a Swedish movie Jägarna 2, which deals with a similar theme. Rural cop is put between backing up his local boys and big city copper defending the law. It also had the local sheriff being involved in a horrific event with a girl. This movie wasn't a horror movie, it was a crime thriller drama. I Spit On Your Grave could've been similar strong on drama and not so strong on gore and shock factor.The finale put me off, it's horrible stuff and somewhat waters down the rest of the rather good movie. You get your revenge, cheap revenge by horrific gore and disturbing images, those which some call ""imaginative death scenes"" in horror movie jargon. I decided not to watch them all, but rather covered the screen at times, I could say what was going on, but didn't like watching .. at all.Nobody here is better than the other, there's no winners in this movie.",I Spit on Your Grave
79,stevenfallonnyc,Garbage,3,15 December 2019,"I say ""garbage"" not because of the subject matter, as the original is an exploitation classic. This remake is completely pointless and frankly is so thin it barely holds any interest at all.The story kind of follows the 1978 original, with a few minor tweaks (mainly videotaping the rapes, and a bad sheriff). It's interesting how virtually identical plots can give such different results.This remake is so void of any substantive characterization (yeah we get it, rednecks are bad, whatever), it pretty much runs as a cheap fan film. Actually, it seems the only reason the film was made at all was to film some torture scenes, and even they are dull.Funny thing is, the rape scenes in the '78 movie are much more brutal than what is seen here, which is mostly humiliation towards the girl. But the camera shakes and the music is so cliched, and add the characters themselves and the film almost seems like a comedy. The lead actress making all ""angry"" faces during her revenge scenes as the ""scary"" music plays on cue while she drops a few not-so-clever bon mots was particularly amusing. Her wooden acting makes you hope for yet another shot at her butt because that's the most interesting thing about her. The character, who isn't likable to begin with, also turns into a female ""Jigsaw"" in a sense, an expert at minor torture devices, a skill out of the blue. The rednecks have some funny lines like ""City boys are fags,"" and similar life observations.The star has an amazing body though, and in true exploitation style there are some gratuitous scenes of her jogging through the woods to highlight it. While the addition of the bad sheriff had potential, that won't make the film any better because everything involved is so poor.There are also some plotholes you can run a semi through, but the film is so bad it isn't much of a bother.So sure, if you want to see the lead actress sleepwalk her way through the film, some funny rednecks (I was expecting the ""Deliverance"" music actually) and some boring torture scenes, this one's for you. Or, simply watch the original again.",I Spit on Your Grave

The way this girl gets back at those men is at one hand great but at the other hand I'm asking myself; ""Where did she get these ideas to kill them that way?""

81,Tcarts76,"Disturbing, Unsettling....Great Horror movie",9,26 September 2012,"This one I give a big ole 9. I thought it was fantastic as a Horror film goes. This is a remake, and admittedly I have not seen the original. Now, the story is somewhat of the basic horror film layout. An attractive young woman goes to spend time alone in an isolated cabin in the sticks surrounded by nothing but horny white trash men. Gee whiz, what do you think is going to happen....That's where it lost 1 point for me. Of course she is brutalized and left for dead, then returns to exact some justice for herself. OK, that is just the run of the mill set up, but where this movie gets its 9 pts. from me is the disturbing scenes through this movie. This movie shows you why rape is considered such a horrible crime, even by those behind bars. This movie is not for the squeamish at all. The rape is deeply disturbing and at times even me, a lover of great horror movies, found myself wanting it to get over with or look away. The revenge scenarios were just as graphic and creative in their love of gore. The first horror scenes in the movie are so disturbing because they contain things that the viewer not only can imagine happening, but they know that these type of things have happened. That is the hallmark of great horror. Scenes that show how inhuman to fellow humans actual people can be. In the end you feel a little bit ashamed of actually liking a movie like this, but then again isn't that what this kind of gore is actually intended to make you feel? 9 out of 10, even if I am not proud to say it.Like my reviews, hate em, any DVD's you would like to see reviewed?

She revels in the silence of being alone and one with the woods. She soon realizes she is anything but alone. Enter some town folk who are hellbent on having a good time and savagely rape her repeatedly. The act is quite graphic and definitely not for young viewers or those that are squeamish.The film pushes the boundaries of the torture and rape scenes, this is meant to do that and stun the audience. The woman does not go quietly, she comes back and with revenge and vengeance fueling her.

83,homecoming8,Wow.. Makes the original classic look like a Disney-movie !!,8,5 February 2011,"The original ""I Spit On Your Grave"" (aka ""Day Of The Woman"")and the original ""Last House On The Left"" have a lot in common; - They're both so-called 'video-nasties' from the 70's which were often banned in several countries. - They have both a brutal, much alike, revenge story. - Both titles have had a recent remake. I loved the original movies and I certainly loved the remake of ""Last House"". A good remake honors the original but has to expand on it. Think of the excellent ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Halloween"" remakes. All remakes have something in common: they're way more extreme in graphic violence as their notorious originals. That is also the case with this remake. The story is true to it's original but adds some interesting new elements to surprise the audience who's familiar with the '70's version. The acting is very well done, the pace is high and the impact of the realistic violence is maximum. The torture- and rape scenes are extreme and hard to sit through. But it's nothing compared to what happens next. But if you don't show it, the movie will be pointless without any impact. I can understand that the Unrated version will go too far for some people. It's certainly not meant for just anyone. People who hate this movie shouldn't have watched it in the first place. I think the title says enough ! If you're not into horror or violence, than just don't watch it. Unlike the brutal and senseless censorship of the ridiculous MPAA back in the late '80's (Friday the 13th Part VII anyone ?), today anything can be shown on screen. And after 7 Saw movies, people expect the next step. This is it.. Hard to top in the future.",I Spit on Your Grave

Monroe Review ITS DATE NIGHT This of course is the remake of the 1970's exploitation film that for reasons I don't know has a cult following. The Film is about a young female writer who is raped in the woods by a couple of hillbillies and is left for dead. However she survives and exacts her revenge by finding sick,twisted and prevented ways in killing them. And I got to say I hated every second of this film. In this remake less time is devoted to her revenge then it is too,verbal,psychological and physical abuse.People give this film credit for having great female empowerment. News flash dummies these films are pure exploitation,why do you encourage female empowerment cause she kills them all in the end,bull.They constantly show this poor woman being raped by hillbillies. it's as stupid as it is sickening. The fact that she gets revenge later in the film does not encourage female empowerment,it just shows us that in order for this film to have a plot in motion it had to constantly show a woman being brutally raped and beaten so she could get to them in a way that's just as sick. He is just afraid of them when she kill as she was when they raped her,she kills them out of fear in what sick twisted world could you call that female empowerment. The tag-line for the film is just as tasteless,the tag-line is ITS DATE NIGHT,its date night,yeah guys I may have never had one but if you take your girlfriend to see this they will break up with you the before it's over. I think a better tag-line would have been you will never be more ashamed to have a dick. The shots are lazy and hack,the actors are not only bad but should all be ashamed of themselves as well. Every second,every inch,every frame of this GODAWFUL movie was assening and made me want to shower ten times. All the brutal and rape in the film is completely unnecessary. Why was this movie made?

I know this film is a remake but i haven't seen the original as of yet so this remains unchartered territory to me. OK i do not recognize any of the acting talent used in this film but usually that mean's it will be a good . Sometimes a film of this nature can be ruined by casting big names. it sorta wrecks the indie feel and charm. Sarah Butler portrays writer Jennifer Mills who after the success of her first novel has decided to run to the woods so to speak for some uninterrupted laptop time (and loads of wine drinking) to work on her next book. Her first mistake. Word to the wise...If you are young and beautiful, do not go out to a cabin in the middle of butt **** nowhere all by yourself cause you never know! She stops on route for some much needed directions unfortunately gathering them from a motley looking crew of dudes and pretty much announcing that she is all alone. Her second mistake. Of course most of you by reading the synopsis for this flick know what happens next as she arrives at the cabin and is later paid a visit by the band of backwoods hicks that gave her the directions. Only they are not visiting to see if she is OK, they have other things on their minds. now i have seen a lot of films with this kind of genre, however i wasn't prepared for the violent rape scene that ensues. All i will say is that the tension that this scene brings only adds to the satisfaction of Jennifer's revenge against her attackers. And revenge is sought out in very barbaric ways which pleased me as i totally felt they got what was coming to them!!! Sorry folks i'm an eye for an eye kinda guy.

88,FKDZ,A Better Remake,5,2 October 2021,"First off the quality of this movie is 10x better than the original, whilst still a small budget it feels more refined and is acted much better.Going into this type of movie, you know what you're getting. The original focused heavily on the assault and less on the kills. Here it was better balanced, but I still felt like it dragged and gave too much time to the assailants. I wish we got to see more of the protagonist working her way back up and devising plans.The pacing was alright, but as I said, it gets really slow at times. The acting was good, from pretty much everyone involved.The kills, even though these are arguably much more gruesome and bloody, I can't say they blow the original's kills out of the water. I guess I wished for a bit more creativity, that the original did have like the bathtub scene. The visual effects are good and nasty, lots of bloody drool and that personally just sets me off. That said there is one CGI element with the crows, not that good and it took the realism out of it.Soundtrack, not much to say, just a lot of generic suspenseful music that was used a bit too much in the early sections of the movie.The ending was fine, I didn't expect more.

Female lead, Sarah something, was just dreadful. Over acted all the way through. You wanted her to get killed in the end. She was way more cruel then her attackers. Evil, sick human being in her revenge.The guys were just as bad. But none deserved the torture she gave them. It amazed me when she was so helpless when they were attacking her. But she must have pumped iron or something to be able to carry their limp bodies all over the place. Amazing. She suddenly became superwoman.If I could give this a minus rating I would.

91,chow913,Surprisingly Superior,6,7 December 2015,"As I die hard exploitation fan I'm going break the rules and say, I hated 'I Spit On Your Grave.' It wasn't bold, it wasn't brutal, it isn't a classic. It's bad acting, bad film making, and a boring and unimaginative story.So as much as I hate quick cash in remakes, which is exactly what this is, it is a far better film than the original. It's only major problem is that... it is a remake hence it has a very limited story to work with.They do try and improve on the story as much as possible so it's more logical. After the local yokels attack her in her cabin she actually escapes and runs to the sheriff for help. However, he joins in the gang rape. And this time instead of the attackers simply leaving her alive they do actually try and cover up their brutal crime by trying to kill her. But of course she escapes and lives in the woods as a fugitive. This makes far more sense than the original which simply had her and the attackers merely returning to their normal lives like nothing ever happened!!! It was also an improvement to cut the actual rape scene down to five minutes from THIRTY MINUTES IN THE ORIGINAL! We get the point. Rape is bad.Weeks later she returns to town for revenge. Now, it's time for the meat of the movie, the torture porn. I'm not a fan of torture porn so the only thing I ever hope for is some imaginative torture methods. This film is far more imaginative and brutal than the original.The most gruesome elements take place off camera which is better since we don't actually need to see them as long as we know what she's doing.The weakest scene which everyone rightfully always complains about is the bad CGI birds pecking out the bad CGI eyes. Yes, the FX here are atrocious but that's the only bad scene.My only other gripe is redneck annoyingly filming everything with his 8mm camcorder. Alright, I know they're poor rednecks but 8mm camcorders have been out of production for over ten years! Overall the acting is solid and so is the production quality. Nothing fantastic but certainly above average.",I Spit on Your Grave
92,nikitalinivenko,I Spit On This Movie!,1,5 February 2020,"Roger Ebert said the original '78 version was the worst movie he'd ever seen. I thought it was passable, (and makes for a pretty good double feature with Craven's original Last House on the Left), especially after this remake, which might be one of the worst things I've ever seen. It's a soulless video that exists to leach away at your time and brain cells. At least the original felt more authentic and had that real 70's grit where they weren't afraid to show you the s#*t. This one, like all other sanitized overly-sensitive 2000's garbage, (don't think I'm being gratuitous just to be gratuitous, but it's literally the rape scene that defines I.S.O.Y.G.), completely waters everything down, neutering the rape for a delicate snowflake generation and robbing the movie of any actual effect. This was just a female 'Saw' clone/knock-off, but even cheaper, lazier, idiotic, and so, so, so goddam empty. At least in the 70's they knew how to handle exploitation, with realism, balls, and a flourish; this generation of so-called ""exploitation"" is more offensive because it's child's play lacking any true grit; it tries to be more gratuitous for no reason while still being sterile and relatively clean. It has none of the artistry that made the 70's counterparts at least watchable. Avoid this like a toxic dump (this movie even has the lifeless grey texture of the dead zone of Chernobyl), you're better off watching the original - at least you can call that a film, instead of this cheap idiotic internet video.",I Spit on Your Grave
93,By-TorX-1,"Initially Brutal and Intense, but Falls Apart Like a House of Cards",6,16 March 2016,"Given the rape narrative that lies at the heart of the story, the film is brutal and uncompromising, adding to the level of horror and cruelty displayed in the original. However, sadly, this intensity falls apart once the revenge killings begin simply because they are unfeasible, if not impossible. Rather than direct and realistic attacks, Jennifer opts for Saw/The Hooded Claw-style elaborate killings that simply make no sense and cannot withstand any reasoned scrutiny. Aside from where she gets such pristine (and perfectly fitting) clothes having lurked in the woods for 3 months, there is no way she could hoist the various male characters into their respective torture devices without help, and she has none. Thus, credibility dies with each male brute. This is a shame as the film opts to ape torture porn (a subgenre already jaded well before 2010) and just serves to make the film seem derivative of Saw, Hostel, etc., all of which were made long after the original I Spit On Your Grave. Sarah Butler certainly gives a powerful performance, it is just a pity that this intensity could not have been extended into realistic acts of revenge. As such, with every convoluted and implausible killing, a card is removed from the filmic house to the point that it ultimately collapses in on itself by the denouement.",I Spit on Your Grave
94,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,Unadventurous,6,13 November 2013,"This film consists of three parts: the build up; the rape; the final revenge. Now you don't have to see it ;/It took a little too long to get going. Tedium kicked in after 15 about minutes, which would normally be the time for effective character building and scene setting, but instead, I just wanted to get on with it.Although I enjoyed the film in parts, there were still a number of things that let it down. Questions popped into my head and shattered the immersion factor. The girl jumps into the river to escape, followed by a mass search attempt for her body. She doesn't come up for air or surface anywhere. No explanation was given as to how she survived, where she resurfaced or why the men didn't find her - she just survived and that was it, destroying much of the credibility and plausibility of the film.The best part of the film is the revenge section, however, which was done pretty effectively, but again I had questions. How did she survive, where did she live, what did she eat, where did she get the equipment from, how did she attain new clothes when all her possessions had been destroyed, how did she heal her wounds, where did she get the car from, how did she do her make-up for the family interview scene, etc? Plain logic and unanswered questions.The director could have cut the first twenty minutes of the film and given us much more depth and answers.Generally speaking it was an interesting and pretty well made piece of cinematography, but which dragged at the beginning and posed too many unrealistic questions. At least it was a decent terror flick with plenty, but not too much, graphic detail.Watching this film won't be enough incentive to dig out the original or watch the sequel though.",I Spit on Your Grave
95,MovieProductions,I spit on your good script,5,8 March 2011,"** out of (****)Alright, I'll save you the time and day. Want to see these blood-thirsty rednecks get hacked to pieces? ""I Spit on Your Grave"" is right up your alley. You know exactly what you're getting yourself into. No questions asked. However, I must confess, this film was actually well done, and for that, I can appreciate it. The acting is slightly above average, the direction was just right, and the deaths certainly had me squirming in my seat. The big question is: what's the point? The original is still alive and running, this story has been told before (and better too), and it's just so uninvolved. Also, this whole ""Unrated"" charade is a tad bit misleading, and frustrating too. Both ""Hatchet II"" and ""I Spit On Your Grave"" supposedly ""fought"" the MPAA because their content was deemed too ""wild for theaters"". I honestly think that was a publicity stunt because both films are R-rated material. It's nothing you haven't seen before. A little gorier than the average Saw film, but not enough to get such an intimidating rating. First off, I won't go into plot details. I find it pointless to talk about the story when the film is a remake, the story is very copy-and-paste, and it just wastes a paragraph. Now onto the movie. The acting was actually not too shabby. Granted the actors don't have much to work with, they were convincing for the most part. Moreover, the direction was well handled. The director provides some nice atmospheric shots, nice scenery, and knows how to work his way behind a camera. Also, the film never lagged, even though that's kind of expected. I thought the pacing worked because the scenes felt fleshed out, and I feel the director has an eye for suspense. Now what went wrong? This movie's tone is just inconsistent. The film's first third starts out like a crafty, Hitchcockian thriller. Then, the movie's second third is very melodramatic, depressing, and just flat-out juvenile. The remainder of the picture acts as a dark comedy, except the joke is not on us. I think the director had a little too much fun with this film seeing as how it starts out outrageously upsetting, and then works its way around like a black comedy.All in all, I can come to terms with ""I Spit on Your Grave"". It's well-crafted, especially for a film of this nature. Although, couldn't all this money and hard work be put to better use? If I was a director, and had a budget of what, a million dollars, I would think of something inventive, unique. Not something that anybody else could do. And if you have to know, this movie is highly undeserving of its ""Unrated"" label. Even the penis death has been allowed in R-rated films, (i.e. ""Teeth"", ""Piranha 3D""). I think it's just the filmmakers trying to build up hype. But seriously folks, there's nothing new to see here. Just the same ground, except bloodier.",I Spit on Your Grave
96,chris330r,Implausible to the point of absurdity,3,18 February 2021,"I love a good revenge flick, but to believe this tiny girl masterminded an elaborate revenge plot against 5 brutal men all by herself without a hitch is laughable. What's worse is we really don't get much character exposition to care anything about this girl in the first place.
When we meet her, she's off to an isolated cabin in the woods to write, drink and toke marijuana. She lets rapey looking country hick gas station workers know exactly where she's staying too...alone. We know from the get go she's not the brightest bulb on the Christmas tree.
Then when she's there, she leaves all the curtains open at night while in her bra and panties, sunbathes outside in a teeny bikini and takes runs in the woods wearing next to nothing.
No i'm NOT saying stuff like this makes her ""deserve"" it...but any sane person would show a little more self awareness and be more mindful of her surroundings, especially when you're a young pretty woman all alone in the woods. She seemed completely clueless to any potential danger that may have been lurking. And drinking and getting high only lowers your defenses even more. For a city woman she was lacking basic common sense.
Then there's the whole revenge plot where she freely murders 5 men and leaves their bodies all over the place to easily be found. And the kicker is that she actually goes to the wife and daughter's home of one of her victims and SAYS HER FULL NAME right in front of the wife, easily identifying her when her evil shotgun raped husband is found with his butt blown off.
Sure she may have the tape depicting the crime for the police, but that's not going to get her off a premeditated murder charge of 5 men. And the way her traps were all elaborately staged, she's looking at the death penalty now.
So the whole film is rendered illogical and senseless. I guess the whole point was to show the brutal murders but I could just watch any Saw film for that. I'm giving this 3 stars because I stuck around till the end because I had to see how she'd get her revenge.
I see there's a part 2 & 3 to this trash....Oh good lord do I want to torture myself any further? I hate to admit my curiosity is probably going to get the best of me and I will lol. At least after this, my expectations are low and I know what i'm getting into.",I Spit on Your Grave

99,nixskits,"New ""day of the woman""!",9,13 July 2010,"I must admit, I haven't seen the original version of this film. I went into the Fantasia festival screening of this Meir Zarchi produced remake fresh, with no personal comparisons to make to his landmark picture (both he and new director Steven R. Monroe were in attendance, along with lead actress Sarah Butler and producer Lisa Hansen). And not knowing many more specifics than the 30 year+ legends of this story. I can say I was impressed with what new writer Stuart Morse and the fine cast have presented and how the talented director interpreted it! Be warned, those who don't like gore or explicit depictions of heinous events. This is probably not the flick you should check out! But if you're strong stomached enough to handle recent ""torture porn"" that has little or no conscience in it's artistry (which this will be dismissed as by many, but I think it's really NOT), then you might dare to watch.Sarah Butler's Jennifer Hills character is a young writer seeking serenity to help the process of completing her newest book. What she has forced upon her soon after arriving and adjusting to the rustic peace of a lakeside rental cabin are amongst the most disturbing scenes I have ever witnessed and I've seen many intense, horrifying films in my life. Her performance for me ranks with the great turns of fellow big screen rape survivors, such as Ned Beatty in Deliverance and Jodie Foster in The Accused (AND fellow Fantasia breakout star Amanda Fuller in Red White & Blue)! Butler's shattering, heart stopping and completely believable performance of a woman in this nightmarish ordeal is never exploitative and neither is Monroe's direction of the attack. The raw brutality of sexual assault is shown in the proper context. That is, a crime of power, domination and humiliation. I had much doubt before the show about how I'd react to these moments. And my feelings are Butler is so good in the role originated by Camille Keaton that this remake will become a worthy debate subject fuse for the limits of extreme subject matter in modern mainstream film. One might not like ISOYG as a work of art about deadly serious hypotheses on crime, but nobody can find artistic fault with Butler's terrific work here. Bravo, Sarah!Chad Lindberg has almost as difficult a task, portraying a mentally challenged man who's compelled by the thugs he grew up with (uniformly great Daniel Franzese, Jeff Branson, Rodney Eastman and a new contender for the most despicable poster boy for smiling evil, Andrew Howard) to lead the gang rape proceedings. His take on the fragile, but still capable of unspeakable violence Matthew is heartbreaking in it's delicacy AND ferocity. Watching him and Butler together during the prolonged attack was among the most painful moments for me. Lindberg delivers a multi-dimensional, impressive turn and his talent gives it an unforgettable resonance.Monroe has a long attachment to ISOYG and realizes he will be lambasted for directing a new take on one of cinema's most reviled and legendary tales. What he gives us is not a hollow 2nd generation quickie to cash in on it's predecessor's infamous name, but a searing, realistic effort and for that I admire the job he has done here. It's a man unleashing a vision of a female's violation, then vengeance, with plenty of reason to be. The 21st century will give us hard to watch epics, but this was truly a worthwhile experience for me. I won't elaborate on what happens post-assault, but will say anyone who can see their mother, daughter, sister, friend in Jennifer Hills and her suffering will be very interested in her revenge and how THAT plays out. It was incredibly well handled!The announcement this film would be released this fall in it's uncut form, not bowing to the 100+ cuts the MPAA requires for the more commercially desirable R rating, raised many eyebrows. I hope if it indeed is released unaltered, there will be enough moviegoers to give this a fair viewing. You can already imagine the hateful reviews some are ready to write and publish merely hearing the title. I just want the market for those filmmakers not bowing down to the antiquated and far from perfect MPAA ratings system to have an alternative in this day and age.",I Spit on Your Grave
100,jmatrixrenegade,Inferior Remake,4,15 June 2011,"(from a blog post of mine; I reviewed the original on IMDb too)The original is not to be exaggerated as to merit. The remake, which I saw on DVD, was disappointing. The trailer for the original speaks of five attackers, though there were only four, but this one adds a fifth (a redneck sheriff). The original had Camilla Keaton, the actor's granddaughter (though at least one source as I recall suggested some doubt on the matter); this one has a character actor in a bit role. I toss that in as trivia. Anyway, the addition of the extra person, having the lead talk a lot more, a few touches updating the time period (such as her having a laptop and cell phone) and so forth really doesn't add much positive to the film. Some suggested the original star didn't have much acting chops, but I think her overall silence added to the proceedings. A few more sarcastic revenge tinged comments didn't.I think the lead-up and intermission (after the rape, before the revenge) was done better in the original. A scene in some cuts of the original where the guys talk about the ""city girl"" was particularly powerful. Jennifer being being harassed by two of the guys passing in a motorboat (sorry fans of the original, not much motorboat related early or late here) not here. For some reason, they cut the scene of her going to church, praying for forgiveness for the sins she will do. And, unlike the retarded guy not being able to go through with killing her in the original, this one has a lame ass scene of her falling into the water, them not shooting at her or anything and then she pops up some time later ready for revenge. The original showed her right after the rape, the horror of the situation clear.The rape itself is not as explicit as in the original (that really drew things out) and it suggests how remakes often are less gritty these days. The remake of Assault on Precinct 13 or The Taking of Pelham One Two Three both appeared from previews and what I heard about them to have similar problems. But, it's not really necessary to draw out the rape. That's not really the issue here. I do like the original Jennifer. This one seems more like someone out of some WB show. The clip of her walking nude after the rape was briefer here and as unrealistic looking as some stylish show there too. The original was gritter and dirtier. You might feel dirty watching it, but that's the point -- she was abused horribly and her revenge is psychologically understandable if not defensible (for some). The guys are not really much different though again the original set probably did the job better.The revenge of the original has her trick the retarded guy and ringleader (the latter by having a bath with him!) in ways that turned their use of her around. Since she basically had died inside (the last shot again underlines this more powerfully in the original), use of her body toward this end was understandable. It was not merely some exploitation device though the honest viewer realizes that is part of it. What else is an extended nude scene in a bathroom, including her putting pins in her hair while talking to the ringleader, right before she castrated him with a pair of scissors? The second half of the revenge was quicker, but also turned around an earlier bit of harassment by two of them in a motorboat as well as the desire of one for oral sex.The sequel does have an original worthy twist, this time concerning anal sex (with a gun) though The Descent probably has the best answer in that department. But, overall, the scenes were stupid. The basic problem was believability -- how did she actually move the guys around to set things up? She didn't need such strength (didn't seem to break a sweat) in the original, where surprise and guile did the trick. The bit where she pretended to be the cop's young daughter's new teacher (the remake gave the family man one less kid) was a nice touch. Still, if you didn't like her using her body in the original as much as she did, fine, but the remake's revenge scenes left something to be desired.Overall, the remake was okay. As suggested, it didn't have the style of the original and some aspects hurt the overall flow of the film. The lack of a portion between the rape and her starting to gain revenge particularly was a major deficit. The deleted scenes showed that a scene in the church was shot, but that's all that we see even there. The lack here robs the film of a key dramatic element. It is as if The Descent skipped from her rape to her revenge, with her dealing with the trauma of the situation basically off scene or basically assumed. That is quite possible, but that's like assuming grief in a portrayal of tragedy -- the audience generally should see some evidence of emotions, not just take them as a given.",I Spit on Your Grave
101,austin-takahashi,I Spit on Your Grave - 0 Stars,1,8 June 2012,"""I Spit on Your Grave"" is a horror film that is sickening, sadistic, cynical, disgusting, depressing, revolting, maddening, dirty, empty, and eternally worthless. This is one of the most deplorable things I have ever seen so far in my life. And I'm not just talking about the movies.Let's get this over with. A novelist by the name of Jennifer Hills decides to spend some time alone in a cabin in the woods. Five wicked men, along with their mentally retarded ""pet"", stalk her. She is later verbally abused, beaten up, humiliated, and raped. The men don't feel the need to hurry as they take turns in imposing their evil upon Jennifer. While one of them rapes her, the others assault her with spiteful words or actions. Sometimes both. She manages to escape. She disappears for awhile. When she returns to the screen, she captures and tortures each of her punishers until they are dead. When the last of them perishes from a shotgun blast, Jennifer releases a cold, faint smile, and the movie ends.Filled with grief, disbelief and contempt, I glared at the screen. Who would do such a thing? How dare its makers use the art form that is film for something like this? While viewing it, I could not help myself but be curious of the actors. Why did Sarah Butler, the girl who played Jennifer, agreed to be here? What did her friends and family thought of her decision? Did they support her?

106,shannen-l-c,Brutal and disturbing horror that is let down by dramatisation and cliches,3,17 February 2018,"Being such a huge fan of the horror genre, I knew I had to watch 'I Spit on Your Grave'. I'd heard from a relative that the original was so gory and uncensored that it was banned in a number of countries, so my interest was immediately piqued. However, I was recommended by another friend to skip the original and go straight to the remake, so that's exactly what I did. Going into the movie I expected something similar to 'The Last House on the Left' and it does share it's similarities, the main one being the premise of a rape/revenge plot, but there are also a lot of differences. The movie is incredibly predictable and lacks in any kind of creativity or originality (which is a pandemic in the horror genre over the last couple of decades). The length, brutality and realness of the rape scenes is by far the most memorable part, since it's so disturbing. Having watched so many horror movies over the years, I've become rather desensitised but that really did affect me. In that way, at least, it succeeded because I strongly believe that all horrors should have an impact on the viewer and this one certainly did with me. However, unfortunately, that's where the good ends for me. The complete lack of build-up, one dimensional and unlikeable characters and over-dramatised and unrealistic murders completely detracted from the potential the movie had. Admittedly, the cast did the best with the scraps of material they were given but even that didn't save the characters. The antagonist's (the rapists) were a bunch of men that for some unknown reason were all totally okay with participating in a brutal gang rape and torture, and actually found pleasure and humour in it. Not one of them showed any ounce of remorse, humanity or regret and it makes no sense that these young men would be so incredibly evil and black and white. Whilst the Sheriff was expanded on slightly more with the introduction of his wife and daughter, the others were completely undeveloped and bland. Even the main character herself, Jennifer (Sarah Butler), was lacking in any kind of personality, back-story or intelligence. Why was she even at the cabin in the first place? The reason we're given is that she's writing a story, but why would she go to that tiny, off the grid town that she clearly knows nothing about all on her own? There were numerous signs from the get go that the men she'd met around town were strange yet she did nothing about it. But the scene where she escapes from the cabin into the woods and bumps into the Sheriff is where the stupidity really starts. What Sheriff would take a young woman that has just been raped and tortured in the most horrendous way back to the scene of the crime? Why the hell did she go with him? Anyone in that position would be screaming and begging to get in the car and drive away to the police station. Even as the Sheriff was in the cabin asking odd questions, Jennifer still didn't catch on to the shadiness of his character. Her stupidity continues after she escapes the rapists into the stream and apparently goes on to live in the wilderness for months where she admits she fed on rats, pigeons and other vermin of the like. This is where the story really does get too far-fetched. Why the hell would she do that? Why wouldn't she return home to safety and then plan her revenge from there? How would she even have survived out in the woods on her own without even the basics of clothes? Supernatural or fantasy horrors may be better able to get away with this kind of far-fetched nonsense, but 'I Spit on Your Grave' is supposed to be a realistic story of a woman who was a victim of a cruel and senseless crime that sought revenge. That means it should be as authentic and realistic as possible. The revenge killings during the second half of the movie only take the movie to new levels of stupidity. Instead of just killing the men, Jennifer somehow manages to fashion complex devices and methods of killing them that she would be completely incapable of executing on her own. Whilst the rape scenes resonated because they felt so real, the murders entered into Saw-esque territory which felt unfitting with the first half of the movie. 'I Spit on Your Grave' is definitely what I would consider to be a mediocre horror movie that's seeping with over-used cliches and lacking in logic, coherence and thought. It also suffers from bland, unrelatable and boring characters that are impossible to invest in and incredibly over the top violence and gore. The only reason this movie has managed to get a 3 star rating from me is because the rape scenes do have a lasting impact as it really hits home how many women (and men) are victims to such evil and brutal crimes everyday.",I Spit on Your Grave

111,Healing_Process,A film concept that I'm not ashamed to enjoy. But this missed the mark.,4,30 October 2019,"The 1978 was a different movie at a different time with a lot to say. Though movies from that period sometimes seem to age poorly, some remakes must be done to give awareness of the first or shine new production techniques with an old idea.This however, does not do well in almost all regards. The movie has no sense of thrill or horror and tries to show a movie with high production values and falls short.I could care less about the controversial topics involved but the way it was directed really turned me off. It took nearly an hour and 10 minutes for the rape and hillbilly shenanigans to even finish which is 60% of the movie.And the worst part about it is the lead actress Jennifer (Sarah Butler) did not give me a convincing show of scared, hurt, and ""shut off"".And to top it off, I thought her transition to her revenge phase was more silly than scary or intimidating.After the long wait for the source of the movie to even begin, the revenge was not even fulfilling. They were over the top morbid torture methods that only a weird game show would come up with. Though I find it super hard to even beleive that someone as city girl as the main actress would be able to go through these torture methods without being disgusted first or even having a hard time going through with them. Because she is not a psychopath or depraved like the ones who raped her. There was absolutely no character development or real character struggle besides acting in the actual rape scene and torture scenes.In conclusion, the movie really wanted do nothing but show a rape scene and some mediocre creative torture methods. Which I think is missing the point completely from the original which was showing more of the turmoil and less of the special effects that try to be on par with the ""Saw"" sequels and ""Hostel"" movies

A lady who goes to a secluded cabin to write her latest novel is rudely interrupted by a trio of rednecks who viciously rape her. After she licks her wounds and heals, she sets out for revenge and gets it. In extremely graphics ways. One unfortunately redneck is castrated and then has his eyes pecked out by birds. The other two meet their end in equally horrible but justified ways. Definitely not a movie for the squeamish",I Spit on Your Grave
113,longcooljolie,Visceral thrill ride,6,19 May 2013,"This review comes from someone who has not seen the original, so it will be reviewed as a stand alone horror movie.For the past ten years a new sub-genre of horror has emerged, which can be best called ""Extreme horror."" The ""Saw"" series unofficially started the genre, roughly ten years ago, then came the ""Hostel"" series and the Rob Zombie Halloween remakes could also be considered extreme horror. Some of the ""Final Destination"" movies also fall under the category. They give otherwise sane people a chance to delve into the ultra macabre for ninety minutes to two hours, the way a theme park mega coaster gives a thrill to otherwise safety conscious and down to earth people.""I spit on your grave"" succeeds as the type of entry extreme horror enthusiasts will enjoy. The movie was impeccably cast and the acting is first rate. Sarah Butler as Jennifer Hills projects the right amounts of beauty, innocence, and vulnerability that help make the rape scenes especially harrowing. Lots of thought was given to the character and look of her rapists. They all have separate and distinct personalities and they all perform various ""jobs"" during the rapes.The revenge Jennifer enacts on all her rapists is shriek worthy and probably got cheers in crowded theaters. Without giving too much away, a can of lye is shown early on in the movie and it turns out to be a deft foreshadowing of one of the revenge plots. All of the rapists receive wickedly horrible retribution that's painful to watch.As many other reviewers have pointed out, the movie falls short from a plot standpoint. Again, without giving too much away, would it have helped matters to show how Jennifer recovered and later, how she was able to overcome guys twice her size in some cases and maneuver them into the torture contraptions? To flesh out those details would have resulted in a different kind of movie. Some scenes show her looking ghostly in the revenge scenes, so maybe that would explain the supernatural powers.Is it great cinema or even a great horror movie? No. It is, however a well-done and satisfying entry in the extreme horror genre and a better- than-average horror remake.",I Spit on Your Grave
114,cthetrancedone,Revenge Done To Perfection,8,9 November 2020,"I would've given this a 10 but for the horrific rape scenes. The second half of the movie would get a solid 10. Although the first half as well as throughout is superbly acted with excellent scenes and direction.I've always been disappointed with revenge acts in movies as they just aren't vengeful enough!
But this wow this IS ENOUGH and more!After the horrific abuse Jennifer goes through in the first half, the writers if this movie had a seriously real challenge on their hands as the revenge had to be good, real good. And it was.
I really wanted to feel better about myself watching this movie and thankfully i did as the revenge acts on each person literally suited each type of abuse she suffered! Horror movie torture at its ultimate creative best.
Sarah Butler gave a fantastic brave performance throughout.
All those other lazy torture movies out there don't come anywhere near close to this in terms of revenge done properly!
The amazing ending leaves you wanting more from brave Jennifer so now I'm ready to watch 2 & 3.",I Spit on Your Grave

I have the original version of this and it for its time was very well made and disturbing to all that watch so I was not sure what to expect with this remake.Its one of the few films i have seen that made me look away and wince a number of times and I am a horror fan. The rape scenes in it are not as harrowing as the original (thank god) however its well acted in my opinion and my wife and another female viewer could hardly watch as the Sarah Butler is abused in many ways. However getting her revenge was something all men would shudder at. Yes the way she exacts her revenge would not be possible for a girl her size however, the way in which she disposes of the clan of rapists is eye wateringly good.The last guy to get polished off left me thinking he well deserved that ..All in all a good remake, harrowing to watch still but a great effort.

This is one seriously messed up movie!As others have said, watch it at your peril.In terms of the movie itself in terms f acting, storyline, etc, I thought it was good. I haven't seen the original others talk about though, so I don't have a comparison.The disturbing part is the scenes that make up the story. The revenge scenes were full on! I found these more ""disturbing"" than the rape scene (and no, I'm not condoning rape at all!). As I'm writing this, I'm trying to think of a revenge movie that is similar- Man on Fire comes to mind though it wasn't as graphic.I'm definitely going to have to check out other Sarah Butler movies though. She played the part so well. I'd also be curious to read her thoughts on making the movie and whether it had any affect on her.....",I Spit on Your Grave

But once you get to the revenge stage it starts transforming into horror. The movie in a way is very predictable, but it's nevertheless pretty scary put together. The characters are believable and well played. So why only a 7 and not higher? It's the predictability factor that drags the movie a bit down. Then if you expect a thriller but it ends in more horror like scenes it knocks an other point of the numbers. If you're not easily scared and like a bit or horror like events, go and watch it. If you only like pure thriller, don't watch it, you'll be disappointed.",I Spit on Your Grave

First of all she jump in the river and was able to survive after they waited there for a long time. Then she suddenly got clothes and they search all over for her but she found another cabin with a mattress but they didn't stumble there? Was the clothes hers? which means she would have to have gone back to the cabin she original stayed in. Then again they burned her stuff so where she got the clothes from. After she got away she could have find a way back to city especially after months because they would think she died but instead she stuck around and learn how to build traps and stuff?? I assume she was also stalking them since she knew where the sheriff lived and the others. Why didn't her friend come looking for her or send the cops? Then she took way to long to return it was 28 minute into the movie where she just torture them... All of this just didn't make sense, Where did she find tape from and all the other stuff from?????

120,ckinnair205,Incredible,10,28 September 2012,"I Spit On Your Grave is about a young woman, retreating into a desolate cabin far into the woods. As you can see the film is already quite spooky just by the short sentence. ISOYG is incredibly disturbing and very hard to watch, Although the element of horror is included I would definitely class this as a Drama/Horror Revenge film. It reminds me a lot like This Is England 86' last 2 episodes. It has the same element and theme of it, only it is generally much more graphic and pretty twisted. I must say, I enjoyed this film although it did upset me a lot. The hour and 40 minutes went increasingly quick, to say how bad it was. Normally films like this drag out for me but this one felt like 5 minutes. But it was horrible. There was multiple scenes where I closed my eyes because the noises were enough and was disturbing. I did not need to see it happening. all in all it was quite a good revenge horror/drama!",I Spit on Your Grave
121,parkerrodney,Sad Commentary on the state of human affairs,5,8 September 2019,"I Spit on your GraveMy usual tagline while reviewing movies is movies are seldom just movies, but rather a metaphor of larger issues about culture and civilization. In this regard, I Spit on Your Grave is no different. In its purest sense ISOYG is a revenge movie. A movie about a woman who seeks revenge on a group of men who humiliated and brutally raped her. But it is so much more. It is about differences between class in city versus rural cultures within the US. It's about success and failure and stereotypes. It is about male emasculation, male crudeness and uncouth male behavior all of which has been demonstrated over centuries throughout the world. Although male rapists come in all forms, these particular men are unsophisticated country bumpkins who don't seem to possess much intelligence and are clearly motivated by feelings of economic and social inadequacy. In other words, they are not on her level and they know it. Seemingly, the mere awareness of women who possess poise and confidence is enough to bring out the hatred in them. If rape is truly about power, then it is also about powerlessness. In this case the social, economic, and political powerless of a group of people. In this regard, ISOYG, is the collective revenge mind set of women and men who want to see severe and just punishment taken against powerless male assholes - societal losers.In general, there is nothing special about the details of this movie. The graphic brutality of watching a woman humiliated and raped, even if only for acting purposes, is difficult to tolerate but is necessary to appreciate the revenge scenes which pretty much mirrored what was done to her, minus the murder. The underlying message in movie is that men who gang rape a woman deserve to be sodomized and shot through the rectum with a shotgun (yes, she did that) neutered with a hedge cutter (yes, she did that also) and killed at the hands of their victim.Most people will likely have no qualms with how the victim took her revenge. I certainly didn't. However, I have to remember that movies are never just movies, and the underlying message is that gang rape is such a heinous crime that it is okay under these circumstances for women to take the law into their own hands. I don't know if people would feel the same way if an immigrant from Africa did the same to a police officer who in the basement of a police precinct, shoved a night stick up his rectum and punctured his bowel (yes, that happened in NYC).In the end, promoting revenge killing where the victim gets away with their retaliatory crimes may be entertaining and warm the heart and be morally acceptable, but may corrupt our culture and civilization in other ways. Nonetheless, with the exception of the end, like many others, my heart was warmed.",I Spit on Your Grave
122,0maro0,So bad it's hilarious,1,4 January 2021,"Somehow, this film manages to be disgustingly graphic and not graphic enough at the same time. Rape scene is a joke, I've seen non-horror movies presenting this in much more tragic and unnerving way. It's filmed to be ""scary"", but it's completely censored and lacks any pshychological tension. Similar with revenge scenes: they are gory and stereorypically ""horror-like"", but not holding any shock value beyond blatant violence. There's splatter genre, of course, but film's concept honestly deserves better. Besides, it's not even that graphic, this totally could be filmed in much more revealing way. I mean, if they were going for it, at least should've done their job right.
But this is not the worst thing about this movie. It has two: writing and acting, which brings us to hilarious part. How characters act, what they say - this can't be percieved normally. At some point, you will probably start to laugh because of how idiotic all of it is. People can talk like that, of course - in cheap pornography, that is.
The only believable character is Matthew. I suspect it's because actor who plays him, well, actually decides to play. Also, Matthew doesn't have a lot of lines, so writer can't really ruin the image here. Too bad, though, since one actor can't really hold the whole story on their shoulders. It's just... Everything. Bad cinematography, predictable plot, characters that seem completely fake and average attempt to ""cure"" it with gore. Doesn't work like that. Can't work like that.",I Spit on Your Grave

124,weemonk,Revenge done right,8,21 January 2011,"If you're going to take on a remake of a notorious film you have to do it right. If said remake is notorious due to it being one of the 'video-nasties' of the 80's, maintain the core element of the film that put it on the list! If you do this then you end up with a good (and sometimes better) remake. The Hills Have Eyes and Last House on the Left remakes worked by doing this and not trying to water down shock content. For a remake of 'I Spit on Your Grave' the same had to be applied otherwise it would have been pointless.The original 1978 movie was a brutal and shocking film for its time. Still today you can not get an uncut version of the film in the UK. It's not an amazing film and will only have been watched by fans of the genre. So, how do the filmmakers approach this remake?........with a brutal vengeance! Like the LHOTL remake did, the filmmakers have kept the raw, brutal violence of the original whilst polishing the story and injected some new life in to it.Sarah Butler does a great job as the woman who is raped and brutalised who sets out for revenge. I thought the acting from all the cast was spot on. It must be really hard to 'act' in such a horrendous way for this type of film.What elevates this film above the original is that they decided to reduce the rape scene in its intensity and go full hog on the revenge part of the film. Whilst still quite brutal and disturbing, when we get to the part of Jennifer being raped, it's not as drawn out or horrific as it could have been if they wanted to piggy off the original.In this take of the film the main portion/concentration of the film is given to Jennifer getting her revenge....and boy does she do this in some really nasty ways....and when we get to those parts of the film, thanks to the scripting and direction, we're 100% behind Jennifers character in the justification of her actions. It may be gory and some may call it torture porn but when she exacts her revenge you'll be cheering on. I actually think this film should be shown to rapists as a deterrent (unfortunately you'd need a woman like Jennifer to back it up in real life).So, this isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea due to its content but if you've seen the original, or you're a fan of the video nasties era, definitely check this out.Very good remake.",I Spit on Your Grave

I understand the second part as a little bit over fictional, but so delightful to watch, not only for the creativity on the revenge scheme, but also on the effectiveness of the action itself. I would like to know how Jennifer survives the fall into the river, and how she managed to recover and design the vengeance, but I understand that the gap in the script is for suspense proposes.

After watching it, I can finally say that it is indeed disturbing. Note that I have never seen the original, so I can not compare it to that. However, this film resembles The Last house on the Left, where a woman is beaten and raped, and revenge is set out for the perpetrators. The revenge sequences against each perpetrator are so bloody and gross, almost unwatchable. I had to close my eyes, and almost threw up, especially at seeing the teeth pulling scene. I've heard people call this a feminist film, as the girl goes against her attackers, but the message that seems to come across is that she needs to commit violent acts against the violence inflicted on her. I love horror films and am always looking for new movies to watch, but I can honestly say this is one of the more unnerving and revolting movies I've seen, and will probably never watch again.

It's not giving anything away to reveal that there's a rape scene in this film but be warned it puts anything you saw in ""Last House on the Left"" the remake to shame. Graphic doesn't even begin to describe what the audience are subjected to by the voyeuristic intentions of director Stephen Monroe as he puts the audience in the front row seat for almost two hours of pure abuse.But this is a good thing. Surely rape is visceral, brutal and sadistic and this film embodies all these elements. And once the reported revenge begins it's even more brutal than anything done to her.Superb and bold performance from Sarah Butler in a role that is probably considered by most to be career suicide. When her character takes revenge it truly is the stuff that nightmares are made of and some scenes made me cringe for at least an hour afterwards.Watch this one at your peril.This is highly recommended only for those who sit through a showing of cannibal holocaust without vomiting.

I read the movie had to be cut a few times in different countries and I understand why. Unfortunately in the world three are some sick individuals who might get an inspiration from this.
But let's talk about the movie in cinematic terms. Well, there are too many holes in the script for my taste. For instance, it's already bad enough to get 3 friends country morons willing to rape but to include the village sheriff joining the party is a step too far. Later, she jumps in the river so how does she manage to scape fully naked and make a return? We don't know. Once the revenge starts she seems to have the ability to knock people out into unconsiousness really easily, big men you know and then like it was in the ""saw"" series she manages to drag the guys and tie them up in readiness for torture.
It's everything very predictable, you know they will fall one by one so really you're just looking forward to how the guys will die.
I know the movie has a low budget but it could have been improved with a better script. The leading actress is good, the others are ok but unfortunately it's just the lack of imagination, originality and a better script that let the movie down badly.
Technically it shows its low budget.",I Spit on Your Grave
133,d_3434_d,Finally a good horror movie with guts!,8,22 January 2012,"These days any form of alleged ""sexuality"" is portrayed as good and acceptance of promiscuity and perversity is considered ""open mindedness"". Just think of Paul (2011), Mysterious Skin (2004) or I Love You Phillip Morris (2009). Bashing Christianity is ""trendy"" in Hollywood movies. Bashing Rednecks is also ""trendy"" in Hollywood movies. It's no wonder why the movie industry (and it's even worse in case of the music industry) is loosing so much money these days. Who wants to watch the same thing over and over again? Most movies we see in the theater today are predictable. If it's about aliens, the aliens are portrayed as superior to us. If it's about rednecks or Christians, Christianity is bashed and rednecks are portrayed as inbred retards. If it's about gays, you are most likely in for some gay porn (or something that will border gay porn). If the movie features drug addicts, drug abuse is portrayed as normal. If it's a horror movie, it's most likely going to focus on gore, cheap CGI, a (mostly deformed) serial killer or anything along those lines. American movies have become so predictable, there is no point anymore in going to the theater. Hollywood has developed a habit of remaking movies in the last decade, I guess as a last resort because coming up with anything new seems to be impossible for them. Unfortunately, their remakes are downgraded to the level that Hollywood has sunk today. So there you can skip them as well. I Spit on Your Grave is an exception. The movie is a breath of fresh air, as compared to all the other (horror) remakes.Jennifer Hills (portrayed by Sarah Butler) is a writer who goes to a cabin to do some writing. As the description of the movie states, when she is attacked she begins to seek revenge. That's when the movie begins to differentiate itself from the typical ""serial killers/rapists/sexual perverts/anyone abnormal are (completely/somewhat/totally) innocent victims"" movies. Since such movies are so rare, the R rating of the movie feels very welcome. There is finally a good reason for a movie to be rated ""R"" (and not just for shock value). You can identify with the protagonist. You see a story that is normally trashed and ""spit"" on - not surprising when you look at how the Western world treats criminals today (complete with a TV, video game console, porn collection, etc in their prison cells). That is what makes watching the movie also feel very liberating. You finally get to see a realistic movie - without the Hollywood clichés.Excellent movie, totally recommended!",I Spit on Your Grave
134,mrda1981,The notorious rape & revenge flick gets a modern-day torture porn reworking,7,4 February 2013,"I have to say that watching this newer, grimmer remake made me appreciate the humanity that informed the original film, flawed though that was. In the '78 version we had a heroine who was defiled yet not destroyed, a protagonist who reasserts her autonomy, and femininity, and, yes, humanity by taking revenge over her id-driven attackers. Here we have an innocent, naive girl, effectively eradicated by a more menacing, calculating crew of assailants, returning as something of a wraith (complete with visual nods to The Ring) to drag her rapists to Hell with her.Far from regaining her autonomy, femininity, and humanity, this 2010 version of Jennifer Hills re-emerges from her ordeal as half-spectre, half-Frankenstein's gestalt, poetically mirroring the calculated cruelty and sadism of her torturers. Her victims being utterly reprehensible fu cks, the fitting punishments she inflicts on them prove both amusing and satisfying to watch; yet that haunting, final shot of her, staring blank-eyed at the camera, hammers home her reduction to a patchwork of a person, effectively recreated in the image of the same elements she set out to destroy.

However, when I saw how many people have no idea what they've watched and still post their ""reviews"" - I had to.
I won't compare this movie to the older version because every movie is a new story, new actors, new time...
""I spit on your grave"" is a great movie, although with heavy theme and gory details. Sarah Burton did an amazing job acting a rape victim, fragile city girl with no idea of what is going on and why. And then the transformation into a cold blooded killer looking for revenge. This is one of a few horror/thriller movies where we see a real person turn into a real monster. Because she had to, the debt had to be paid in full and with interest. And there are no superpowers and similar, just pure revenge and rage, brought up by a few sick individuals.

137,mdarmocida,Better than the original but it still sucks,5,4 September 2012,"This movie was far better than the original because, to me, it was far more realistic. In the original the woman seduces the men that raped her. Really? Do you think any man would willingly let a women that he just raped seduce him? Even an amoeba would know that she's just out for revenge - not to mention that keeping her around would add to jail time. Secondly, the original movie went straight from rape to revenge without even trying to contact the authorities before she was safe. Luckily the second movie had the authorities angle covered.Here's were (like the first movie) it goes off track. In the first movie this tiny woman is able to pull on a rope to hand her first victim. Come on! They could have at least set it up with a little more leverage to make it believable. Perhaps a bowed branched that is tied down and then released to carry the man's weight. In the second movie, this tiny woman apparently also obtains super human strength by being able to move and lift these huge men after she knocks them out.Then there's the satisfaction angle. You really want these guys to get what they deserve. In the first movie the protagonists were more stupid than vile, so the satisfaction quotient just wasn't there. It was like killing a retarded bunny rabbit that accidentally got in your garden. The second movie did a much better job of making you hate the low life scum that compromised the protagonists. However, even with the elaborate setups the satisfaction quotient wasn't there for me (much better than the first movie, but still not there). It would have been better if she made them do the things that they did to her before she tortured and killed them. For instance, it would have been great if she made the sheriff's wife watch the video of the rape so she would know what a low-life he was before he died.

Right off the bat when she goes to pick up the key 4 her rented cottage, anyone else would run before going in the place. Besides, she has a smartphone, won't she Google Map the place before going? But, instead she follows a hand-drawn route to the cottage. Oh c'mon!It's a skimpy version of teenagers, here only one girl, taking a trip to the wilderness. The rest is beyond predictable.If you manage to the last act: vengeance, the acts are interesting from the actor/director perspectives, how the he'll actors put up with the scenes.

So when I saw they remade the original I Spit on your Grave, I was intrigued at whether it was better than the original which was a low budget B horror movie for it's time.

2. The rape was a bit disturbing but it didn't last long . I mean I watched movies like irreversible and Siberian film. It's not that disturbing.
3 . Here comes the best part of the movie the revenge . I mean she used her skill and intelligence .
I personally liked the way she took revenge from the sheriff . I mean the stepup was quite surprising. And when she said ""It was fun while it lasted"". I was like On your face.Definitely watch this.",I Spit on Your Grave

2. The right amount of rape content. I thought the director would prolong the scene just like irreversible. But it's just sufficient.

143,IPreferEvidence,A Solid Remake,8,1 May 2011,"I was actually quite skeptical of this even though I had heard a lot of good things about this. This time the rumors were right, it was good. The remake tones the rape down a bit but it makes up for it in gruesome revenge(and I have always preferred the revenge part). Even the famous dick slicing is there (a lot more graphic than in the original I might add) but not as intense because the victim already knows whats coming unlike the original. The kills in this one are actually really f***ing cool and funny as well(like the one with the shotgun and the dick- slicing) This movie was maybe a bit more believable then the original because the characters aren't so over the top but than again it doesn't have the charm of the 70s one. I spit on your grave(2010) is a gorier and less original re-imagining with an OK cast and nice special effects. Also I think the phasing was great and it was really fun.I'd recommend this for fans of horror/exploitation and fans of the original. Check it out",I Spit on Your Grave

I should say that emotional part was very well done,, I definitely felt that.Lots of people say that, it was not good and it doesn't make any sense, because they don't understanad why she felt like that after just one month, but when you are victim you feel too much anger, specially first times, it's the hardest part in your life. You are everytime thinking about that and planning everything in your mind how to destroy thouse life who destroyed once yours and how to take revenge.And yes this movie has some flaws but still it has huge emotional boom for thouse who felt for victimes.

147,rstout3526,Why was this movie re-made?,3,5 July 2012,"In the early years of the 1980's when video was in its infancy I watched some of those sensationalist 'nasties' such as Driller Killer, Texas Chainsaw and I Spit on Your Grave. Low quality, poor acting, bad plot lines, grainy colour et al. They held a curiosity factor but were of little merit when compared to the likes of Straw Dogs. These cheap movies had a limited market and exposure. So it begs the question as to why these should be re-made? If the theory goes that you re-make a movie to make something better than the original, then that is fine. However, in most cases the re-make is nearly always inferior. That refers to both mainstream cinema and gore/horror low budget flicks. This re-make of I Spit, although it has better camera work and production values, is nevertheless a like for like piece of work with elements of the original flimsy plot excluded. If you haven't seen the original then the plot would seem weak.The first half of the movie builds up to the violent rape scene followed by the girl throwing herself into a river, presumed drowned. Not a comfortable viewing experience. But then the second half immediately delves into the individual acts of revenge by the girl, despite a month having lapsed without her body being recovered. The original movie showed the girl having returned home to get well before she returns to exact her revenge. In this movie her acts of revenge are just standard gore. The movie ends with many questions unanswered. Above all, why did these actors agree to make this rubbish. They surely will not be invited to appear in mainstream movies of any merit when this flick is on their CV's. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, except for those who like shock horror gore. If you must see it - try the original first.",I Spit on Your Grave
148,pabald9480,This version is better on many levels!,8,28 August 2012,"I like both versions of this film, both for their own merits. However, this film is so much better on many levels. The script is more believable, the acting is more convincing and the added story lines didn't hurt for me. Weirdly enough, I do like revenge movies, but only in movies, but these films whip up some wild revenge fantasies for rape victims. The only person other than Jennifer that I had any empathy for was Matthew(like so many others on here and Amazon). Usually, I have no compassion for rapists, but with Matthew, I had to make somewhat of an exception, but his killing was somewhat more merciful, if you can believe that. I've watched it five times, and find something new each time. However, certain people will find both versions potentially disturbing, but you still may enjoy the ride involving her revenge.

149,miked6022,Extremely Disturbing...A One Time Watch,6,30 April 2012,"Never before has there been a movie that would motivate you to pack a shotgun before you leave for your next vacation in the mountains. The movie is nothing more than 2 hours of long, drawn out torture scenes. Every bit of psychological, sexual, and physical torture is very graphic, and very long.Perhaps the director of this film should have curtailed some of the violence in favor of a little bit more of a back story on these characters and their motivations. Perhaps, then, the characters would be fleshed out a bit better. There is no reason given to why these men are vicious and seem to pretty much hate women. They come across, simply, as a bunch of redneck lunatics.The main protagonist, the writer Jennifer Hills, is a pretty sympathetic character. Her treatment in the early part of the movie validates the fitting demise she plans for each of her attackers. The problem with her character, again, is lack of a back story. There is nothing in this film to suggest that she can live in the woods for a month and not only survive, but thrive. When she finally comes out of hiding, she is not malnourished or dehydrated at all, but stronger than ever. She is able to physically overpower much stronger individuals and torture them one by one.Major plot hole: If the rednecks burned all of her belongings after their assault in an attempt to destroy evidence, where did Ms. Hills get the clothes she wears later in the film? She didn't seem to pass any Hollisters or Abercrombie & Fitches on her way down Mockingbird Lane towards the cabin. And what about the black car she is filling up at the gas station when she confronts John...where did that come from? Does she know how to hot wire a car? Did she go to the Chevy Dealership on the mountain and lease it? How did she get it? This is not a Date Night movie. It is something to watch one time, then try to get the horrific images out of your mind. Perhaps the most frightening part of this movie is how plausible it really is. This film can really make you question where, and how, you vacation.All that being said, the actors and actresses do a fantastic job in this movie. Sarah Butler is terrific as Jennifer Hills. As stated earlier, you sympathize with her character's treatment and are not critical of her character's ultimate response to that treatment. Tracey Walter is great....but Tracey Walter is great in anything he touches. He is truly one of this countries greatest character actors. Andrew Howard, who plays the Sheriff, really does shine in his role. Howard walks the line between devoted father and sheriff and psychopath extremely well. His portrayal can send shivers down your spine.",I Spit on Your Grave
150,fvwyk1-804-458094,Good Revenge film! Worth a watch! Spoilers ahead,7,30 September 2013,"This is a remake of a 1978 film, that I never watched, and have no interest in watching.We are so used to see all these thriller/horror - films go extremely bad for the poor victims, that we sort of expect the lovable character, in this case Jennifer, played by Sarah Butler (Very good performance!), to perish in a somewhat brutal way. But not Jennifer! She actually does something that I so many times wished for in similar films. She finds the balls to fight back and take proper revenge! And boy does she make the creeps that terrorised her, suffer.. Good on her! This film left me with a moral dilemma though, as it makes you question what your own response to a horrific and brutal attack will be. Jennifer got away after the attack and she actually had very proper proof of being tortured by the sheriff and the boys. She could have easily gone back to the city and spilled the details on the corrupt Sheriff of the town and what they did to her.. But then again, it would not have been such an interesting story, and who knows, maybe I would have also preferred revenge instead of justice? I have never been through such a thing, so I am in no position to predict what my response will be.The acting was good, some scenes were quite shocking, but I have seen much worse.Overall a very interesting Revenge film, with quite a gruesome revenge kill at the end.. I also enjoyed the acting of the creepy Sheriff Storch, played by Andre Howard. I will definitely recommend this if you are sick and tired of films where most of the victims die after fighting for their lives. In this case the tables are turned!",I Spit on Your Grave

152,Yarayaraman,"Well made and brutal remake, but lacks the potency of the original",6,29 May 2013,"Having only recently seen the original 1978 film and now the 2010 remake, the comparison here is untainted by having an unrealistically nostalgic view of the original.As a long term horror film fan, I have always found sexual violence especially difficult to watch. It is arguably an odd point of view for a horror buff, but if there is going to be sexual violence, it should be central to the story or point of the film, and is probably why it took me so long to see this or the original. In this film of course, the point is crystal clear: Revenge. It has long been debated as to whether the original was simply a disgusting and brutal exploitation horror, or whether it contains some sort of feminist empowerment message. My view is the former, as the horror is too sustained and harrowing to claim any moral high ground. However, what elevates the original as a visceral film experience is that the 'victim' uses her own power of seduction and emotional manipulation to exact her revenge, just as her attackers use their power of overwhelming physical strength to violate her in the first place. While extremely hard to watch, it gives the film an incredible potency as the events unfold, right up to the closing credits. This key element is lost in the remake, so while appearing more polished in many respects, it lacks the cut-with-a-knife tension and almost documentary like realism of the original.The bigger budget and modern special effects result in an overall improvement in production values, acting and the ability to portray far more brutal and imaginative revenge scenes. Regardless of your capacity to watch either film, you cannot help but feel sympathy for the victim and empathy for her subsequent actions in the original. In this version, while there is no doubt some satisfaction in her attackers getting what's coming to them, you leave the experience having little sympathy for anyone. The way in which the story unfolds also feels rushed, and subtle changes to the original storyline make it unnecessarily disjointed and less believable.This was never going to be fun to watch, but I felt compelled to see what could possibly be done to top the original, and was a little disappointed with the result. By upping the brutality and gore to a ridiculous level (in the vein of the Saw movies) and by removing that sense of female empowerment, the film actually lost much of what made the original so powerful. It is still worth watching for the comparison, and is reasonably paced, but do not expect anything beyond a bloody-as-hell revenge horror.",I Spit on Your Grave
153,SmakethDown638,"Good, but lacked the overall viciousness of the original",7,23 March 2011,"The original exploitation film from the 70s had that viciousness to it. When Jennifer is tortured and raped, you really feel for Jennifer. The intensity was there and the storytelling in that film was really good. The revenge was pretty cool, and it made for a solid rape-revenge film.The remake felt watered down when it came to the raping of Jennifer. If you're going to remake an intense exploitation flick, you'd better bring it all on when it comes to the intensity. Sure, the torturing and the taunting by the antagonists were a nice plus, but when it came down to the raping, it just felt tame. The storytelling in the remake was not as good. Just like it was mentioned on the boards, you have to suspended a ton of disbelief. In the original, we somewhat see Jennifer go through the recovery process and get an idea of what she is doing in hiding. Here, Jennifer is gone for many minutes! How does she survive? The highlight of the remake was the revenge factor. The stuff that Jennifer dishes out on the antagonists was awesome! I really enjoyed that part a lot more than the original. Overall, I Spit on Your Grave (2010) is solid, but tame in comparison to the original.",I Spit on Your Grave

155,SouthSideChgo,I AM Woman Hear Me Snip That Off!,10,29 September 2010,"SouthSide's not a fan of the ""chick flick"" movie genre. Nor is she a fan of classic movies updated for the millenial generation. However the updated (and unrated) version of I Spit On Your Grave is, in her opinion, the ultimate chick flick ...on suspenseful revenge by a woman horribly wronged featured in any horror movie. Believe, this reviewer, Jigsaw would probably get very squeamish (like many of the men who attended last night's screening) from viewing the graphic, horrific yet creative and inventive ways the main character, Jennifer Hills (Sarah Butler) got her revenge.SouthSide vividly remembers the original I Spit On Your Grave (1978) and was quite shocked and intrigued by the graphically intense subject matter. She skipped viewing the 2009 loosely-based teen version titled Jennifer's Body (starring Megan Fox). Yet in 2010, comes two versions of the same movie (rated and unrated) of I Spit On Your Grave still retaining the original premise - a young woman viscously attacked and assaulted ...brutally raped and then left for dead ...but with a modern twist. Unlike the '78 version, this new version involved five men attacking our victim-turned-heroine ...there's more suspense and intense drama throughout the movie which definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat ...and plenty of creepy movie mood music to add the element of surprise that that there's something horrible lurking around the corner. SouthSide liked how director Steven R. Munroe used a pseudo-documentary camera style which moves with the characters throughout the film as well as sets up the scenes about to happen next instead of stationary camera shots. Though it might feel a slow drag towards the gripping brutal rape scenes this gives the audience a chance to familiarize themselves with the six main characters (and a few minor ones) involved in the storyline.Within the unrated version of this movie, be prepared for not only scenes in which Jennifer was brutally raped but assaulted by three men (Johnny - chauvinistic pig, Andy on harmonica, and Stanley - the nasty voyeur)before the rape with Matthew, a mentally handicapped who refuses at first but is goaded into raping Jennifer. Add the fifth man, a sadistic sheriff (with a pregnant wife and young daughter) into this terrifying mix and it turns into a graphic scene with most of the rape nicely blacked out ...yes, you have to use your imagination in what the others did to her. This reviewer enjoyed how the director gave the audience a sense of calm when life returns to ""normal"" for out bad guys after unable to find Jennifer's body in the river. This where the ""fun"" of getting her revenge begins ...and NO ONE is spared from her wrath not even Matthew who's the only one feeling a bit remorseful for what he did to her. The others do get their just ""desserts"" in the most creative ways as she systemically picks them off one by one. And the way she does it literally had the men during this screening either squirming in their seats from the intense horror scenes (especially during Stanley's and Johnny's deaths) or actually walking out of the theater (waiting for their dates/spouses/girlfriends outside). Yes, horror fans, the sheriff gets the worse punishment out of all of them. Hell knows no fury like a scorned woman bent on revenge! Justice served with a smile....SouthSide has never seen SO many men running out the theater (those who ""survived"" the screening with all their bits and pieces still intact) when the lights were turned back on. Even the critics attending the screening were NOWHERE to be found except outside the theater ...""I AM woman hear me roar"" probably had that disturbing effect on them, SouthSide supposes.So be careful, men, this isn't your ordinary ""dinner and a date"" movie. The unrated version is definitely NOT for the squeamish and/or children under 17.Oh one last thing - look for hidden clues referencing to the original throughout this movie ...plenty to be spotted...",I Spit on Your Grave

I want to warn you here in this paragraph there might be some spoilers but get this. Is it possible for a skinny 120 pound woman (or probably less) to lift 300 pound men (or more) for such long distances and have them tied by ropes in the ceiling and on the floor ? Where the heck did she get her clothes from? How on earth did she escape unnoticed from the river? where did she find food? How did she get so strong and vicious all of a sudden? Not only that but get this, in couple of days she has become (JIGSAW) and started making traps like an engineer. I have no idea what people who produced this pathetic movie were thinking but they might have been on drugs!

157,brad_the_metalhead,Not for the faint of heart.,8,2 June 2012,"I really liked this movie, but it is by far the most disturbing movie I have ever seen, this film is not for anyone with a weak stomach, but the acting in this film is phenomenal and very realistic which is another reason why this movie is so disturbing.The film starts off with a sweet and beautiful woman going to an isolated cabin to write a novel when these sick and twisted guys come in and brutally rape and torment her and leave her for dead, but she does not die and starts killing and torturing the men.This film is so realistic that it is extremely hard to watch, the rape scenes really shook me up, it felt like I was there and there was nothing I could do to help her, its that realistic, Sarah Butler did a brilliant acting job she is super talented and I can tell after viewing this film that she must have gone through hell while making this movie.After she is brutally raped and beaten, the once beautiful and sweet woman turns into a savage killing machine, inflamed with rage and revenge. Once she starts killing and torturing the men that did terrible things to her you start to cheer for her because what she does to these guys is extremely brutal, and while you watching her do these things even though at times you might want to look away you can't help but say they deserved it.Also, the sick twisted men in this film also did a great acting job, they were very convincing when they were acting sick, sadistic and disturbed, and while they were being tortured by Sarah Butler's character they did a great job at acting like they were in pain and pleading for their lives they really pulled off a good acting job.This is a good film with very talented actors, however I don't recommend anyone with a weak stomach to watch this.",I Spit on Your Grave
158,dylan-ramsay91,I Spit On Your Grave,6,26 February 2011,"So this is the remake of the 1978 horror classic, and as soon as you hear the words 'remake', 'horror' and 'classic' together, usually the first thing you think of is 'aww man this is gonna suck, why? Why did they have to remake it?' Especially a rape/revenge film like 'Last House On The Left', which in case you haven't saw, the remake failed incredibly in my opinion. But, on the other hand, I found this film wasn't the case. When I started watching this film, I thought it got into it a bit too quick and assumed the film would drag on, but it didn't. Without giving too much away, it's a well-executed remake that has twists and turns that you wouldn't expect.As far as the acting goes it is believable and pretty good. The characters were portrayed excellently, except maybe for Tracey Walter who played the role of Jennifer's redneck cabin-owner a bit too Southernly to be believable. Plus in my opinion, I thought this Sarah Butler chick was more attractive than Buster Keaton's granddaughter from the 1978 version.So if you want to see a remake that may live up to the original, check it out. It's pretty graphic so be warned, but other than that I recommend it for hardcore horror fans.",I Spit on Your Grave

I get it bad things need to happen to get to the point of the story. The set up scene just keeps going and going and yes it is uncomfortable but at a point it became miserable to sloggy. The second half of the movie picks up but also changes tone pretty quickly and doesn't provide a reason for doing so. Plot was OK. Kills were solid. That setup scene was long but good.

I wish I never watched it because it's so disgusting and gross. It's all about rape and the rape scenes went on for too long. 5 dudes each took turns of rapping her and it's disgusting. She cuts of one dudes you know what then shoves it in his MOUTH!!! I almost vomited in this movie it was that revolting.

It's the creme of the crop of revenge horror, you get terrible people and the charismatic main character and then everything goes to hell. It's the best ending of a horror movie, one that managed to keep me interested and amazed, since The Hills Have Eyes. There's no twist like Saw, and it is rather linear at times but if you like horror, this is going to be a religious moment. There's violent flesh wanting animals, chemical horror, shotguns, and a main character that won't let you down on gore. Don't take it seriously and watch for talented acting or fine filmmaking and you should have a very good movie experience.",I Spit on Your Grave
164,SeanBatemanJr,Modern exploitation which I didn't find believable,6,10 April 2013,"I think I should give the movie some points for being different and making you conflicted about what you see. This is is subjective, but for me personally violence against the protagonist in the beginning seems like nothing compared to her surreal revenge. So it elicits very mixed feelings in you, you almost start to sympathize with the villains in the second half of the movie.The biggest problem for me is I didn't find the protagonist's transformation believable. She becomes some kind of slasher sadist, sure it is only toward people who wronged her, but still I don't get how such character could change so much. From the way she is portrayed in the beginning I would expect some other kind of transformation after a traumatic event. I would at least expect to see more conflicted emotions and less comfort while torturing people from a character, who is not a serial killer with 30 years of experience but just a friendly girl next door.Maybe the director didn't sell the transformation enough (I won't blame the actress, she seems to be quite good if you look at the scenes by themselves), or maybe it can't be sold. Anyway, for me the protagonists becomes a completely different character after the traumatic event. The violence is quite hardcore, I was surprised. I've seen most of the modern gory horror and felt comfortable with it, but some scenes in this film were too much for me, I even activated ""chick vision"" and couldn't look at the screen, which was very surprising and probably deserves some points, but also makes it harder to objectively judge this film.",I Spit on Your Grave
165,savaovi,Rather bad,3,11 April 2011,"This film is 50 minutes too long. It has some boring parts that do not build up characters or plot. Though it's gory in a good sense, the entire movie emanates an aura of lack of credibility. Hell, I even laughed at some scenes that were no comedy! If someone can tell me how a 50 kg girl with a frail structure can carry an unconscious man of 80 kilos and then rise him over the bathtub without anyone to help her...Another thing I did not liked was that the bad guys really stole the show when it comes to acting. The main character should have appeared as a mad woman, yet I still saw the same frail girl until the end, while the bad guys did a rather good job as victims.Overall, this is a passable movie for those who have the stomach for it. Just skip the boring parts and you have around 50 minutes of real action. Just 3 stars.",I Spit on Your Grave
166,TodayIsTheDayOurSinsWillBeOver,Stands on its own feet.,8,27 February 2011,"This review MAY contain spoilers or important plot details that may spoil the movie for you. If you haven't watched it, you may want to stop reading now. This review is intended for the US Unrated version of the film which my review/comments are based on.Now that's over with, here we have the remake of the 1978 film, I Spit on Your Grave. Man, who would ever have thought this film would have been remade? I certainly never did. For those who have seen the original, you'd understand what I mean, for those who haven't well, you're about to find out. I Spit on Your Grave tells the story of Jennifer Hills. A woman who goes for a break in a cabin to finish writing her novel, but soon finds herself in the hands of the 4 local men at the start, until she runs into the Sheriff. In this remake, it appears these guys have a strong hate for any women from the city, and, this leads to them beating, and raping Jennifer several times. She is humiliated, forced to dance around, and treated like an animal. Although only 2 of the rape scenes appear on-screen, they're unflinching and very harrowing. The abuse of Jennifer lasts for at least a good 30 minutes of on-screen time. What appears to be even more disturbing than the original is the fact that Matthew appears to be even more mentally challenged, and is heavily bullied and pushed around by the other men to take part in their sadistic violence. Every male character in this movie is BAD. There is no exceptions to it really. Would you even believe the sheriff also turns out to be a rapist too? Now that was a real twist. I can't imagine police departments in the US being too happy about this character but hey, there it is. I have to say, the Sheriff was probably the most sadistic character I have ever seen, and without doubt, a man without any morals (All males are in this movie). Here we have a man who participated in raping and beating a woman, but can go home to his wife, and kids, without any guilt or anything. Hell, he can talk to his little girl over the phone while doing this. Now that's what I call messed up. Not to fear though, Jennifer is alive and let me tell you, the revenge she gets is something else. I'll let you be the judge of that.One thing the film might have forgotten about was the aftermath of the rape, I mean there was barely any of the aftermath shown. It was just, okay this is over, now it's revenge mode. I think there should have been more of the aftermath shown, to justify her revenge - not to say it isn't, it is, but it was an important factor in the original movie.The thing they did make good use of in this film, was the soundtrack - something the original lacked, big time. The soundtrack to the movie lends it a feeling of threat and suspense from the very beginning. If you didn't see the original, from the opening credits, it's like she's already almost in danger especially when she meets the local men at the gas station.Seeing how brutal the original was, I would have thought this would be a tame version compared to it but no, this updated remake certainly didn't leave out any of the brutality of the original, and delivers the goods in flying colours. I personally believe this remake is more suited to be a stand-alone title, but it's obviously a remake. It seems remakes these days are getting better, with this and the remake of Last House on the Left, my faith in remakes is almost restored.If you seen the original, check this out. If you haven't seen the original, CHECK THIS OUT EVEN MORE SO! 3 versions of the film are available. US unrated version is uncut, and the Australian version is also uncut. There's a UK version too, but it's been censored by 43 seconds. I'd go for the US unrated version since this is what I got.Anyway, excellent remake, good film, definitely for adults only, if you're into horror, watch it.",I Spit on Your Grave
167,KittyKelly1976,Excellent film ruined by bad writing and acting!,6,5 February 2011,"This is going to be a hard one for me... I've not written a review for a film on IMDb before, and I just finished watching the Unrated version of I Spit On Your Grave (2010). Right, here's the few good things that I found in this (another) remake of a classic film:1. The Pr-vengeance scenes were excellent, the torture and the build up to the eventual rape. They were among some of the best scenes that I have seen recently, and the acting by the male parties was excellent.2. The overall 'gore' (if you can call it that) was cool, and CGI was kept to quite a minimum, which is always nice to see3. The atmosphere of the film was quite foreboding and dark, keeping in check with the original's values.Now... nobody is going to like me here, but this is what I found bad...1. The acting of Sarah Butler (all throughout the film) was atrocious. Her attempt at trying to sound and act scared was a complete failure, and her vengeance acting later on was even worse. 2. What the HELL was up with the terrible script in this film? More-so after the rape scenes, during all of the killing scenes, they've written in ridiculous one-liner quirks which are meant to be 'funny' in some way, shape or form - it just doesn't work!!3. The character of the Sherri f?? Where the hell was HE in the original, and why did he need to be in this? Why did the director feel the need to add yet another rapist into the mix, was four not enough to satisfy? And come ON - Andrew Howard's acting as ""Storch"" (WHAT A NAME!) was atrocious at best - when he was angry he looked like he was happy, and when he was pleading for his life he sounded like he was going to crack up laughing!4. And now...this is what everyone's going to slam me for - America, STOP MAKING GODDAMN RE-MAKES OF GREAT FILMS. I could leave it at that, but I don't think I will. America has ruined some fine foreign films by remaking them into worse products (think Let Me In, the Ring trilogy, The Eye etc), and now they're even ruining classics of their OWN making! How screwed up is that? NO other country is making remakes, only America - why do they see the need to 'cash in' on films that have made themselves popular and devoted a following?All in all - a bad remake.",I Spit on Your Grave
168,miltruiz506,"It's a Revenge Thriller, People. Furreal.",9,7 November 2012,"I can't understand all this people getting on their moral high horse saying that Jennifer Hills should go to jail for the killings that she did, or several other things along those lines. This is a revenge thriller. If that's not your bag, don't watch it. Some have said that it's a horror movie, or torture porn. I disagree. I would compare it more to Charles Bronson's Death Wish franchise; but better acted, written, and directed. Alternatively, I might compare this to Boondock Saints, which is all kinds of awesome salt. In this day and age, when we have grown increasingly distrustful of authority (seriously, every cop I've ever met is either incompetent, corrupt, or both. If somebody breaks into my house, I'm not calling the police, I'll deal with it myself, and I'm going full vigilante afterwards on the robbers' families, because that's how gangsters intimidate their victims, and I always repay with the same currency, also, whether the cops are corrupt, incompetent, or both, every single one of them is a douchebag. I've never met a cop that I went ""I wanna hang out with this guy""), this movie is one of the few that reflects that reality. The buildup of tension, of seeing how Hills is going to deal with her attackers is excellent. I love movies like this. You don't really wonder whether or not she's going to kill them all, you wonder how she's going to do it, and she does not disappoint, except maybe for the fact that she does not go full medieval. Off the top of my head I can think of one particular method of execution that would be way more excruciating than the ones she uses, and would totally be viable in a rural setting like the one the movie takes place in (hint, it takes several days to die like this; but just a few hours into it, you know that there is no way you can possibly survive it, that is the psychological torture aspect of it, you know you are dead way before you draw your last breath). I think at the end of the day, the morale of the story is to not mess with people you don't know. They just might have a different definition of justice than yours. Whether you like the movie depends on whether or not you still believe in the rule of law. I don't, so I loved it. Now, the spoiler, and I'm only writing about it because I saw somebody ask about it in the comments: The tape. Hills stole the cam and had the tape on her for a while. When digital video was still a thing, all you needed to to is put a blank tape in your VCR, plug the camera into it as input, and it would record in real time. It doesn't really matter if Hills gets caught, she probably has a few copies of what was done to her that drove her to such extreme behavior. I certainly would, and I bet dollars to donuts that no jury in the land would convict her after seeing that evidence. Remember, a conviction has to be unanimous. This case of violent gang rape, attempted murder, and subsequent vigilanteism would always be a wash. Nobody could be a juror on that trial, and not question themselves after seeing this evidence, whether or not these men had not done this multiple times. I would give this woman a medal (my solid gold one, in fact, which is for something else entirely; but is awesome), and I think at least one of any 12 people would do the same.",I Spit on Your Grave
169,Stoneybudzz,"Disturbing, but very good..",10,10 February 2013,"one of the most disturbing Movies, I Spit on Your Grave for the most part it seems like the average B-line horror/thriller flicks the plot is the same girl goes to a cabin for the weekend local punk guys break in rape her etc,, now the acting is Not your typical b line movie, it's tight and well out together, actors didn't miss a beat, not much of a plot to follow but none the less understandable, but where it get's you is first what they do to the poor girl it makes you sick, but still nothing that Hasn't already been done, the now what wasn't the same was this poor girls revenge, VERY GRAPHIC AND DISTURBING!!!!!!, I've seen a few movies like this but not Quite as bad, If you can stand Gruesome disturbing Movies then watch it, If not then pass it will turn your stomach a Little, but very good movie.definitely not a disappointment.....",I Spit on Your Grave
170,ben6464,Accidentally watched this twice,4,28 December 2020,"It's the sort of average film you put on for a bit of fun when you're in the mood.Violence and revenge but it's so boring and forgettable I'm pretty sure I've watch it twice now.The villains of the film make very stupid decisions, the main character gets her revenge but I didn't care. There were some creative kills but needlessly elaborate.One thing that was bothersome, the protagonists spends a month living in the woods after being beaten, raped and living off vermin. She's is going around murdering with perfect skin and hair.Watch ""Revenge"" instead, a much better film in the same genre.",I Spit on Your Grave
171,spikemaze,Mixed review,6,27 May 2011,"I watched the original when I was 18 and was simply blown away. Therefore I had very high expectations to the remake, but at the same time I've seen enough remakes by now to know better. I was very disappointed by the first half of the film. The rape and torture in this movie was nothing compared to the original. Also, we hear too much about the men which isn't interesting at all. We're only gonna feel sorry for the woman, so we don't need any knowledge of the men. The rape and brutality scene was, like in the remake on The Last House on the Left, cut way back on. She wasn't beat up and left for dead, but instead jumped into the water herself.However, the second half was great. I hated the fact that a month had passed, that she wore clothes and she talked so intelligently after a month in the woods, but the killings were great.I think that if you took the first part of the original and the second part of the remake, you would have the greatest revenge movie ever made.",I Spit on Your Grave

177,cthulu48,"I'm not a big horror-remake fan, but this was better than I expected. Absolutely gruesome and vicious. 7 out of 10.",7,27 January 2011,"I watched this movie very reluctantly, as I usually do not like horror-remakes. The form has become incredibly trendy, and the remakes rarely hold a candle to the originals. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the remake of ""I Spit On Your Grave"". First of all, as the viewer, you need to know what you are getting into here when you are watching this film. If you aren't familiar with the original 1978 film, it was an absolutely brutal exploration of rape and revenge. The remake actually stays fairly close to the original, except the remake was filmed 32 years later, which means that the violence and the sexual assaults have been elevated to an absolutely extreme level. As far as I'm concerned, AWESOME! Yet, I know that lots of people are going to call this film ""trash"" or ""porn"" simply because it deals with the topic of brutal rape. There are plenty of ghastly and grisly images in modern horror films, yet everyone seems to think that rape is absolutely the most offensive and the worst violence you can commit to film. To me, it's not much different from the type of violence you would find in films like ""Saw"" (series), ""Hostel"" (series), ""Martyrs"", ""Frontier(s)"" ""Inside"" or ""The Human Centipede"". But, I know some people just can't handle something about rape scenes. If you are one of these people, you need to search elsewhere for entertainment. Even though the sexual assault scenes really don't take up that much screen time, they are pretty degrading and nasty (nothing like you'd see in ""Irreversible"", but this film's sexual assaults can keep up with about any other rape you've ever seen on film). DO YOU THINK I'M SICK YET?? Hahaha, OK, maybe you have a point. However, I'm not especially thrilled watching rape scenes in horror. To me, it's not very creative, although it has an incredible power to shock people. Yet, I was actually way more uncomfortable watching the rest of the violence in the film. I'm trying not to write any spoilers, but let's just say there are some ""traps"" that the ""Saw"" franchise would be jealous of. Absolutely vicious. This was the most satisfying element of the film for me. If you like your horror tough and brutal, you very well may like this film. You must remember a few other things going into this film. This is not the kind of film that's going to get critical praise. The plot is virtually non-existent. Or at least, it's very, very simple. I didn't find this to be a huge problem, because the sequence of events in the film form the story. The dialogue is INCREDIBLY cheesy, to the point of making your skin crawl as much as the violence in the film. Also, the acting is somewhat sub-par (with the exception of Sarah Butler's performance in the lead role). It's the only element of the film that doesn't seem real, which I think detracts from the overall value of a serious horror film. There's also a loose end that isn't tied up at the end of the film, which left me scratching my head wondering why they didn't address what happened to this particular character. These problems are very common in horror films (as most people know), so if you know what you're about to watch and you allow yourself to be entertained, these little problems don't seriously detract from the overall experience of the film. These few negative elements led me to give this film 3.5 stars instead of 4.5, which it would have earned simply for the level of violence and intensity. Overall, as far as horror-remakes go, this one is one the better ones, IMO. I probably still like the original better, due to the novelty of 70's horror films, but I'd actually say it's a fairly close race, and I never say that about these remakes. If you are a fan of this type of cinema, I'd say it's definitely worth a view. 3.5 stars.",I Spit on Your Grave
178,kimjarman19,much better than the original.,10,23 January 2011,"i will start by saying that i made this IMDb account especially to review this film.a couple of months back i was given a stack of old horror/thriller films to watch. amongst them was the original 'i spit on your grave' and i have to say, that was pretty gruesome and disturbing. but i love how the woman gets her revenge afterwards.now a lot of people have been dissing this remake, saying that the rape and violent scenes have been 'shortened and weakened'.. well, what do you expect? this is the 21st century, no one has real sex in a film, no one smokes in films (at least properly).. how would you expect the full on sex scenes that were in the original? i have to say, the violence and rape was aplenty. enough for me to handle anyway. also it has been said that when she gets her own back on them, it wasn't done as well as in the first one, because she wasn't showing herself sexually to lure them into her trap. well i agree, she didn't. i think overall her aggressiveness and rage made it for a whole better ending!i won't say anything else because this isn't intended as a spoiler, just a general review. if you like revenge type films, this is a good watch.",I Spit on Your Grave
179,lashawill,aversive but not scary,5,16 December 2012,"This is an exemplary movie of contemporary trend in horror movies. The trend changed horror movies from 'scary' movies into 'disgusting' movies. Disgusting not in the sense that movies themselves became disgusting (although one might also argue just that) but rather that their main 'trick' became provocation of disgust in viewers instead of provoking fear. But maybe that's not so much a 'trend' in the sense of 'fashion' but rather a desperate attempt to save the genre of horror by somehow provoking aversion in viewers. In fact though, a 'disgusting' movie is as different from a properly 'scary' movie as an erotic movie movie is different from a pornographic movie. This is not to say that 'disgusting' movies are bad in any way. It's just that they're not horror movies, in the sense of ""The Shining"" or ""The Thing"".",I Spit on Your Grave

I was thrilled by the original movie, because you must see the element of female power in it. When a girl is raped and tortured we can't just imagine what would happen to her or about her feelings. This movie deserves thinking viewers not any just viewers. The rape scenes are ""beautifully"" dramatized to make us think of the plight of todays girls.Surely it glorify the violence against a innocent girl, and also cruel killings of men. But there are several rape sites also nothing showing emotions.So before criticizing it understand the moral.

181,kimmed51-45-875436,Entertaining,8,13 July 2019,I enjoyed the revenge flick I Spit on Your Grave. The revenge killings were quite graphic more so than the rapes. I actually use movies like this to practice not reacting or becoming angry. The problem with revenge is it does not cure ptsd and if you get over ptsd you don't need revenge any longer. Emotions are our achilles heal. Conquer those and you've found salvation. The devil if you believe he exists makes most of the movies made these day. If the devil can scare you you aren't tough enough yet. BTW I've pulled out some of my teeth with pliers when money was tight.,I Spit on Your Grave

183,DarrylBrian,Intense and brutal story-telling; you really root for the main character. Worthy upgrade to the original.,9,26 September 2012,"I recently watched both the original (1978) and the remake (2010) of I Spit on your Grave. If you're not familiar they are revenge movies. Both really leave you thinking about it for days like the original Straw Dogs did. The original absolutely pushed the limits for its time and definitely still a hard hitting movie even today. As for the new version, unlike most remakes, this one is a worthy upgrade. Directing, acting, and story-telling were much better than I expected too. There are a lot of changes but for all the better. As I watched the original I could see where updates could be made and this remake sure does that. All the attacks are totally different from the original. I also like that it is not the same exact story with just a modern setting. The story is different but the overall theme is still the same and worthy of keeping the same title. (The remakes for Straw Dogs and The Last House on the Left were just that; the same story just in a modern setting.) Remakes should be handled more like this movie - paying tribute to the original but still be it's own movie; not a carbon copy. The original is available on Netflix Streaming. I rented the remake through Netflix Mail (or you could rent it on amazon instant video for $2). Not for the faint of heart.Sarah Butler does an excellent job considering she is playing a Swan Queen like role. She plays the innocent, young, beautiful, yet down-to-earth girl in the first act of the movie and for the final act she is the revenge-seeking hunter killer. My only wish was that she let out a little more steam during her revenge scenes. In spite of this she still does an outstanding job as does Jeff Branson who plays the lead thug. Also watch the 'making of' documentary in the special features. It is good to see the actors being themselves talking about their roles and what they talked about with each other and how they each handled how to do such intense scenes. Even the menu for the blu-ray keeps you on the edge of your seat - although if you are watching the movie for the first time hit play as quick as you can because it does give you too much of a sneak peak of the movie. I scored this movie a 9 because of how impactful it is. Just as impactful as the original but in a totally different manner. Again, Sarah Butler's performance was superb; I just wish her rage peaked at certain moments. Intense and brutal with good story-telling; you really root for the main character.-@Darryl_Brian",I Spit on Your Grave
184,batteredcakes,Was this supposed to be a revenge movie?,3,25 March 2014,"There might be spoilers in this review so be forewarned. This movie, I'm thinking, is supposed to be a revenge movie. This was not a revenge movie. Most of the movie was the rape and freaking foreplay. The revenge only took like 15 min of the movie. Gory? BARELY. The revenge didn't even amount to what they did to her. 15 min. versus 1 hour of rape (including the foreplay)...that does not add up to a revenge movie, especially when you factor in the weak revenge. Most of the deaths were quick. That is not how you would take revenge for all of that fear, anguish, and pain. It was almost too unbearable to watch because of how long the rape was taking or building up to it. Then add the nudity. First, they show you the main character half naked like as if, in a way, she had it coming, strutting around as she did. Then they do the disgusting deeds. Then show her naked for more time after. It was painful to watch the scenes before that, it just felt even weirder to see her naked afterwards. This movie would've been better if the rape scene was not basically half the movie and the revenge was gory-er and longer. If you're going to make a revenge movie with rape involved, make it a revenge movie with rape involved, not a rape movie with some revenge.",I Spit on Your Grave

188,arinkleff-725-861016,A violent film,10,17 August 2011,"What we have here is a film which clearly portrays rape and murder, although it is hardly the pornographic snuff film that critics have claimed. Indeed, in my opinion, the most intense scenes had very little to do with either nudity or sex.At a deeper level, what we have here is a social commentary upon poverty, alcohol, mental-retardation, and corruption. The 'redneck' culture depicted here is indeed quite real, and arguably the moral collapse of American culture is serving to only foster such forces. Rather than being a titillating exploitation intended to provide 'rape porn', what we thus have is a warning about something which not only can happen, but in fact does happen regularly. Do we only care when the victim is a pretty 'city' girl, or should we also care when the victim is a 'redneck' meth addict? These are the sorts of thoughts which this film dwells upon.Meanwhile, rather than diminishing the horrors of rape, the film serves to make it crystal clear to the viewer just how unstable and unsafe many parts of America truly are. Do we need to be reminded of this? Yes, of course we do, even if we think we 'already know'. In this way, I would consider the film to be comparable to Taken (2008) starring Liam Neeson. In both cases, the viewer is graphically shown what can await a naive girl, and in both cases we are shown the vengeance which unfortunately is very rarely directed against the perpetrators of such crimes.The last half of the film is less philosophical and more focused on revenge, and it is thus more akin to a violent horror-torture film (such as Saw or Hostel), but it would be unfair to argue that this is ""not realistic"" or simply intended for ""entertainment"". Instead, what we see here, is a depiction of the sort of punishment which many individuals would agree is appropriate punishment for rape. Do you agree or disagree? The question is certainly pertinent, but it cannot be seriously addressed unless the actual punishment is described in some detail.Ultimately, by viewing the movie, no doubt is left in one's mind that rape is a serious crime, and that mere imprisonment may not really be 'enough', particularly when the individuals imprisoned would actually -benefit- from being imprisoned. Therefore, I would venture to suggest that the film might serve to deter rape by serving as a warning to potential rapists, by reminding them that the victim (or the victim's family) might choose to act as a vigilante.",I Spit on Your Grave
189,rainbowijij,"Impressive, not as disturbing as I thought.",8,12 April 2011,"I m a horror film lover, decided to watch this film was just to fulfill my curiosity. Especially warnings on some reviews, that make me really want to see how far can it go. I did enjoy the movie, not the tortures but the way a poor woman fights back for herself. I guess it was all because I m a girl so I have much sympathy for Jennifer. For each of the guys in the gang, they deserve everything.I agree that this movie can raise lots of concern to serious crimes to women. I m not trying to ""evilize"" all the men but women did suffer a lot from horrible things done by their opposite sex. Living in a society with laws and regulations, such revenge really shouldn't be preached. However there are thousands of victims can't walk out from the shadow of pain, and many criminals are still out there. Was it fair, if a person hurt you so much and left you for dead, and he could free from any punishment? When legislation is not enough, revenge seems to be a good way to go.I love when Jennifer tortured the gang in almost the same way they did to her. That's what REVENGE is. I especially love the scene when a guy tied on tub, he said:""Please"" and Jennifer replied:""Please is what I said to you, but you said suck it bitch!"" Another scene that the sheriff begged for her daughter, he said:""She is just an innocent girl."" and Jennifer replied:""So am I."" This is one of my favorite scenes too. I enjoy the revenge as I think nothing is better than letting those who hurt you take back what they gave you. Besides, I was surprised and deeply impressed by the last killing scene - which Matthew pull the rope and killed the sheriff and himself. This was shocked and adding Jennifer's creepy smile at the end, I thought the whole film was perfect! I expected there would be more bloody scenes before watching - for example scenes about human organs - which I don't think I can take a lot. But things turned out quite good, not as disturbing as I thought, at least I could still stand it. The tub killing scene and the fish hook scene would be the most disturbing, others are okay with me.Overall this is a very good thrill movie, I would recommend to those who enjoy seeing bad guys being punished. If you can stand ""Saw"", I m sure ""I Spit On Your Grave"" is a piece of cake to you. Try to enjoy the script and tiny details of the film, you will find it very worth-watching.

190,stephanie-06,"Amazing , Amazing , Amazing",10,30 May 2013,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie , every second of it. There was not one bit I thought ' why was this bit put into the movie?' It's one of them movies though , that are an acquired taste. Is gory , is quite brutal at times but it's not just a run through the woods randomly killing like a lot of movies are these days.The movie got quite a lot of stick due to how she handles her abusers , but too me personally , this film is NOT promoting being a vigilante and too take justice into your own hands , to me or how I perceived it as, is with every action there is a consequence and unfortunately these men learnt the hard way. I think why I enjoyed this movie so much is it is not your average horror , with a dumb tart running through the woods crying that she does'nt want to be killed. It's a girl who got attacked , then had her trust abused by someone she thought she could rely on which led her once again to get attacked. And for there actions she goes on a brutal and deadly rampage showing no remorse. The murder she inflicts on her attackers are well thought out and having a meaning (once watched you will understand why she killed them the way she did) , instead of just simply stabbing them or shooting them. The reason this movie got some stick in my opinion is , it's not a common genre of a movie where a woman is attacked by multiple men quite graphically and then goes on a killing rampage.This movie is NOT for the faint hearted",I Spit on Your Grave

I started watching this movie, because I wanted to watch ""I spit on your grave 3"" So I binge watched all three movies back to back to back. I knew nothing about the franchise. Never even seen a trailer for any of the movies. So I had no idea what they were about. I thought for sure it was just going to be another low budget horror movie that I'm so used to watching. But I was oh so wrong.This movie kept me on the edge of my seat for the entire movie. Just trying to anticipate what would happen next. The rape scene in my opinion was a little too realistic for my taste as it was extremely hard to watch. But I guess that's what made the movie so good. The acting was just stellar on all fronts.Like I said earlier, I had no idea what this movie was even about. I had no idea she was to survive the ordeal. And then to see her get even with the rapists. And how she got even was something out of nightmares. After borrowing the movie from a friend to watch it. I went out and bought the movie to support the people that made it. I may never watch it again, but I felt they earned that money.",I Spit on Your Grave
193,mikefoxx666,Superior remake in every way!!!,9,30 January 2011,"This 2010 remake of 'I Spit On Your Grave (Unrated)' is no longer on at the cinema as far as I'm aware, but if you didn't see the movie and you're reading this review contemplating whether or not to buy the DVD, then here's a review for you....(and yes, you should buy it!!): I'll review this movie in comparison to the original as you will probably only be reading this if you're a horror fan and so consequently would more than likely have seen (or have) the 1978 version. The original is of course an undoubted classic and a shocking horror movie and I have every respect for it, but I have to say that this remake is far superior and here's why: It has much better production values; it's beautifully filmed, it had a small but decent budget and it looks slick and very atmospheric with wonderful lighting throughout. The male actors are totally superb and scarily believable; serious kudos to each and every one of them (especially Jeff Branson and Andrew Howard); they are far, far more convincing than the cartoony, generic red-necks of the original. As for the female lead, I could never take anything away from Camille Keatons brave and gut-wrenching performance in the 1978 version, so let's just say that Sarah Butler is a wonderful find and without a doubt this actress does absolute justice to the role!! The storyline is basically faithful to the original but rightly so has been updated to include modern technology. I've read a few moans about the lead character Jennifer Hill accidentally dropping her mobile phone down the toilet thereby rendering her cut off from help, but come on!! something like that had to happen or else there wouldn't be much of a story now would there??!!! The addition of a new character in the form of the Sheriff is very welcome, providing a nice (if a tad predictable) twist. For what it is, his character is so well constructed that it's a genuine treat to watch every scene with him in it.The rape scene is mercifully shorter and more compact than the original and I think that's probably a good thing. Perhaps by shortening this scene it lacks a little of the impact of the original, but it still works extremely well and the utter horror of what the poor girl endures is more than satisfactorily conveyed. If anything the humiliating lead-up to the rape is almost more powerful and horrifying to watch than the rape itself which again I feel betters the original.Finally, the revenge....I've read several reviews bemoaning the fact that in this version the victim does not seduce her attackers as she did in the original but instead just steams in and 'captures' them. Well excuse me, but after what that character endured I just don't think that she or any other woman could then sexually offer themselves up to a foul monster of a man who has robbed them of all their humanity and who has defiled, broken and violated them in such a brutal and horrendous way. The two female friends that I watched the movie with are in total agreement with me on that point too.Some have sneeringly described what happens next as 'torture porn'... Well SO FRICKIN' WHAT??!! Those characters deserved everything they got and as far as I'm concerned the worse the better!! It's a horror film for goodness sake, people do actually want to see some gore and horror when they watch a 'horror' film!!! As the type of guy who lives to see 'baddies' get what they deserve in a movie (and LOATHES it when they don't!!), the fate of the rapists was personally my fave part of the film and if anything I would have like to have seen even more, especially the scene where Johnny get's his just deserts! I'm guessing that budgetary constraints prevented us from actually seeing ole Johnny get the snip, but I would have liked to have seen something similar to the ending of 'Hostel 2' where that nasty piece of work get's de-junked, but you can't have everything I guess!!! The other killings are imaginative and brilliant and are executed (if you'll excuse the pun) in a far more thought-out, well crafted and visually exciting way than in the original.Some people think I'm weird cuz I tend always to prefer re-makes over the originals (The Hills Have Eyes, The Last House On The Left, Dawn Of The Dead, etc)...Well DUH!!! It's because they're loads better!!!! and believe me, great as the original is, this remake of 'I Spit On Your Grave' is truly loads better. Whether you've seen the original or you haven't, if you love great horror films and if you love great re-makes, then this is a Grade A movie - see it, buy it, then add it with pride to your DVD horror collection!!!",I Spit on Your Grave

199,paranjcoolguygamer,Great!,7,5 May 2011,"This is a re-make of the 1978 classic 'Day of the Woman'. Now with a name as sinister as 'I Spit On your Grave', the movie was bound to attract controversy. The original 'Day of the Woman' itself was a very controversial movie with it receiving bans initially upon it's release in many countries. Now I am a violent movie fanatic. I like gore, horror, chills and blood in my movies. I started up with this movie with a lot expectations. Some were fulfilled, some weren't.The thing that stands out the most is the acting. Not only Sarah Butler (who does a phenomenal job) but the whole cast acts very well. They make the movie seem very real. The second thing is the ambiance of the setting where the movie is filmed. The woods, the lonely cabin... it all adds to the realism of the experience that is 'I Spit on Your Grave' The directing is nice too. No out of the world shots but it is adequate. The dialogs seemed a bit to generic. But this are little nit-picks, let's get down to the things that this movie is known for. The explicit rape and torture scenes of Jeniffer Hills and then the scenes of the revenge.The rape scenes seemed pretty well played. They were too in-depth and disgusting. The rape and torture scenes went on for about 20mins and I guess that's what is controversial about the movie. I was astonished by it but that wasn't what I watched this movie for. I watched it for Jeniffer Hill's revenge.The revenge scenes were great. The film let my expectations down on the violence and gore front. I expected more blood but I was let down. But what's good about this scenes are that they are gruesome. The way she takes her revenge is disturbing. Especially the final two. The movie's violence does not hold up to movies like Cannibal Holocaust or Men Behind the Sun but it's adequate. It's done nicely and for an average movie watcher, the movie will be down right disgusting.Overall, it's a great movie for people who like this kind of stuff. It's listed as horror but it isn't. There are no scary/spooky scenes. It's more about the torture, the violence... so if you are in house for some chills then this isn't the movie for you. It's great for what it is. A cult classic and rightly so. Now I am trying to obtain the 1978 version to see if it can surpass this one on the violence front!",I Spit on Your Grave

The film's story is exactly identical to his original, presented his developing certain changes in the characters; including a sheriff as part of the perpetrators of the unscrupulous Act, as well as the order and form of the murders (those who have seen the original understand).The tape is fairly crude and violent especially killings products of the revenge took the young girl against the anti-social that you transformarón life in a negative way; being less morbid and shocking rape sequence, if compared with its original and various killings revealed in the film that criticizes!Extremely repulsive and unpleasant without ceasing to be shocking scene of sodomy suffered by the Sheriff, as well as his friend and ever violation Johnny, feeling of rejection that it suffers and feels at a level higher if it is of the masculine gender!",I Spit on Your Grave
201,KirnehGlitch,Too Hyped!,8,31 January 2011,"I came to IMDb and read a user review about this movie, the person said it to be on the level with Cannibal Holocaust, that could be true if you have a weak stomach. In my case, however, I do not think so. Should be mentioned I have never seen the original version, and found the plot to having been seen many times before. So perhaps if you have seen the original, you will like this more than if you haven't seen it.The acting is top-notch. I, however, found the movie to be going a bit too slow. I was waiting for the action to start, which took longer than I anticipated. The first 15min, I was excited and on my toes, but after that the excitement slowly diminished. In my opinion the best moment of the movie was the last 15-20min.If the movie hadn't been so hyped I would have written a better review, but as it stands, I cannot do that. My advice to those of you who haven't seen the original, do not expect greatness, instead, have no opinion before watching it and make up your mind after watching it. I will watch this movie again in 6months time and hopefully I will like it better then, because it is a good movie.",I Spit on Your Grave

I kept hoping the gratuitous rape scene would end but it just kept dragging on and on and it really seems like the only reason this film was made. There is only minimal satisfaction in the revenge scenes but they take a back seat compared to the rape worship. Also some ridiculous plot holes. Why would she go back to the cabin instead of heading to the police station to file a report? Why does this sheriff who is a father not seem to care that he is committing such an act (he has a daughter)?It is definitely not a horror movie, more like a 'this is why you should not rape even though the director loves it' cautionary tale. Very disgusting and really no point to the whole thing, quite a waste of time unless you like watching a helpless woman get raped and yelled at for what feels like most of the movie.",I Spit on Your Grave

205,mafster-34-787950,Could the remake spit on the original?,10,1 July 2014,"I'm not a great fan of horror remakes. It is simply because a majority just do not need to be done. I can imagine the Hollywood minds, sitting round a large table, smells of coffee cloaking the room. Counting their money they believe that the only way to make horror movies is to... remake them. To hell with the fans of the genre and what they think and feel, they plod along a release constant remakes with nearly all being pointless. They lack intuitive, intelligence and originality.However, there is the odd one that does seem to prove me wrong. Just like 'The Hills have Eyes' and Rob Zombies 'Halloween', 'I Spit on your Grave' is exceptional.The original was drenched in controversy, outlawed in many countries, and to this day remains cut on the UK shores.The remake is following the originals footsteps with countries having scenes cut and substituted, bringing more controversy to this infamous title.The film itself is incredibly well shot. The scenery is amazing and you can feel the lead actress played by Sarah Butler becoming increasingly isolated. Her acting throughout is remarkable and although some scenes must have been incredibly difficult to shoot, she remained focused on her character and the result was first class.A couple of extra dynamics have been added in over the original and I feel it is a good thing and makes you really feel hurt for the lead. The gang of rapists are incredibly nasty and the feel for this does come across very well. The revenge scenes are brilliant. They have the user cheering to do the nasty but then leaving you a little uncomfortable for thinking this. I love these kind of movies that provoke these emotions, bringing out the vigilante in us!I like the blend of calm nature, which will also be the horror scene, giving people a sense of safety and pleasantness but will soon be left invaded and molested by the horrors that come to be.The director has done an amazing job with this remake and one I can say was truly worth while.This film is not for the squeamish and can be difficult to watch for some. I think it puts all the Hostel's and Saw's to shame.Is this better than the original? Well, I loved the graininess of the original, but this seems more polished and easier to watch.

206,alpahcx,Watchable but not a great movie,5,26 September 2017,"I like the revenge/horror genre as much as anyone but this movie is totally forgettable. The acting and the writing are pretty bad. Every situation is foreseeable, over-exaggerated and nothing unexpected ever happens. The first part of the movie, is in my opinion the least mediocre one even though it's full of clichés, it is still watchable through and through and even somewhat entertaining with no real boring parts.However the second part, the revenge one, isn't boring either but it is where all the inconsistencies, clichés and absurd situations really start to show off. Just to list a few : It was obvious the woman was going to jump in the river and try to disappear in the muddy waters, how they just didn't see it coming is beyond me. Then she reappears somewhere between a month or a few years later (it is unclear when exactly) and starts knocking out her rapists with a baseball bat and a tire iron. This is the usual cliché you'd see in every 80's action movie : Hit a bad guy on the head to knock him out for a while... ""He will -always- wake up later..."".Except that in really it does rarely work like that. Chance are, if you hit someone with a baseball bat to the head, he's never gonna wake up or if you miss your swing or don't hit it the right way (which is very likely if you're a woman vs 4 big guys) he's not even gonna get knocked out. The middle ground ""knock-out effect"" is extremely hard to obtain consistently especially with a baseball bat and a tire iron which are gonna brake bones and leave some serious injuries or just do very little damage if the guy you're targeting starts walking towards you with his hands in guard, reducing your momentum and swing distance. This was never though of in 80's movies and still isn't, worst part is that a girl has to wield these kinds of weapon makes it even less believable... I would have believed it if she went for shooting tranquilizer darts while waiting from a safe distance, or if she'd laced their food with drugs... But this frail woman who KO's all those big guys ? Sorry, not buying it for a second.To me, the most important part of a story like that is that it has to believable. But this one, despite being watchable, just isn't.",I Spit on Your Grave

208,cody_perkins88,Far better than I expected but still not a pleasant movie *slight spoilers*,8,26 January 2011,"Unlike most horror remakes we all hear about nowadays I for one found slight potential in a remake of I Spit on Your Grave. It may just be because of the 70's style of filmmaking but I still prefer the original over this one but that does not mean it's a terrible film in any sense of the word. My biggest gripes before going into the movie was the whole modernized aspect of it (cell phones and laptops) and its modern clichés (cop is introduced and as usual turns out to be a bad guy) but all in all I felt it to be a very well put together movie despite its minor flaws. It's definitely NOT a date movie and it's definitely NOT a popcorn flick. In fact, I'd recommend watching this movie alone in the comfort of your own thoughts without having to deal with the awkward silence of the others around you. The plot is pretty much the same but like a recent edit I did of the original, the music score suggests an underlying but yet unexplained reason why Jennifer is leaving the city to be in solitude. The creators of this remake did manage to keep the oppressive tone of the original while spicing things up a bit to give you a tad bit more room to breath. The rape scenes are still extremely graphic and half the time I kept thinking to myself ""were they acting in this scene?"" because you don't really get to see rape handled like this anymore. It's not as raw as the original given that there is virtually no nudity (maybe a little I missed) but the acting ability of the actress made me believe she was actually in trouble. Another rarity in slasher movies these days. My biggest gripe with this remake is that the mentally challenged guy is not really that likable. His acting feels very staged and I didn't fully believe it. At heart, this film is a revenge slasher. And once everything begins to settle down that's when the real plot of the film begins. After being assaulted, double crossed, gang banged, and left for dead, well, you know the rest. It's your standard by-the-numbers slasher but there's just that special charm that sets it apart from all the other crap slasher movies being given the opportunity to waste our time but this one will definitely keep your attention until the end. As a warning, if you've seen the original and get a sense of deja vu, it is very much okay to zone out since you pretty much know how it's gonna go anyway. It's a fun ride and it's likely I'll watch it again at some point.",I Spit on Your Grave

The lead female, Sarah Butler, in my opinion has some talent certainly. Her portrayal as first victim then predator is very convincing.The movie fails though on two fronts. Firstly, the rape and torture scene went on far too long. I'm not sure what the director wanted to achieve on this front but it came across as somewhat gratuitous. I got the point after 5 mins, I didn't need to see another 20. Secondly the story has far too many plot holes in it, even for a horror movie, and it doesn't really enable you to relate to the victim at all. The movie is certainly not one for the faint hearted, it has plenty of violence and some very graphic scenes. That aside I still found myself watching until the end, just to see what would happen.All told, a very decent attempt at a horror.",I Spit on Your Grave

Oh well, I thought, it takes all sorts but as the movie progressed the froth that was coming from their mouths (at least that's what I think it was) almost put me off my popcorn, as was some of the content in this movie.If you are into snuff porn horror then this would probably come highly rated, although I wouldn't really be the one to comment really as there are probably a bunch of ghouls out there more qualified to say on whether the cock-ball torture or anal mulching scenes or whatever they are called were sufficiently get-offable-on. For a big part I Spit on Your Grave is devoted to visually exploring the themes of brutal torture, rape, revenge, sodomy and a number of other deviant topics such as gelding, de-cocking, etc.The movie itself was well acted and believable enough in a strange way, although if you started to notice you were watching and enjoying too many films like this you should probably be worried and seek help.

Sarah Butler is now my favorite queen of retribution and justice, she played the role of Jennifer Hills with guts and passion, I felt the tension in every scene she was in. I said it was Oscar worthy and in my opinion, Sarah Butler should have won the best actress Oscar, she put heart and soul into the part. It was good to see an established actor also play their part in this movie, Tracey Walter is a great character actor and played it well. As revenge movies go this is by far the best I have seen and I put it all down to the cast playing their roles with so much conviction and passion. Each bit of justice handed out was pure cinema magic and eye popping ""Holy S*** did I just see that happen"". This film is a must see revenge thriller with you screaming out ""you deserve everything you get"" to every one of the perpetrators that took a hand in raping Jennifer Hills, no matter how disgusting and nasty it gets. The scene in the cabin near the end will have all men squirming and shaking with fear. All credit goes to the fine acting of the cast but especially Sarah Butler for pulling off what must have been a harrowing rape scene with so much conviction that you do feel so sorry for her because it seems so realistic when you see the fear in her eyes. SARAH BUTLERs performance is 10/10 in this movie.",I Spit on Your Grave

Both the assault scenes to our main character and the second part of the movie, which are the scenes where the main character get back on full force to the guys are fantastic! The acting were good, I can feel the satisfaction seeps through my veins as the main character's super violent vengeance scenes are on. What also satisfies me is that the main character does back what the bad guys did to her - in some ways. Kudos to this movie. This movie has really set the bar very high for action/thriller/gory movies to me. Since I watch this movie, i think only less than 5 movies that could match my need for this terrific kind of action/thriller/gory movie. This might be one of my favorite movies of all time.",I Spit on Your Grave

218,ebert311-1,Don't know which was worst? The Torture/Rape or Wasting Time Watching This,1,21 February 2011,"There are bad movies. There are terrible movies. There are movies that should never be seen by anyone. And then there is ""I Spit on Your Grave"" remake. Unlike the Last House of the Left, which is a similar brutal horror/revenge movie, the whole premise of this movie is as crazy as a crackhead running your bank account. Just like the original, the movie starts with a lot of interesting setup. It's creepy and when they finally get to scaring the lead character (Jennifer), you start to squirm. It's makes you feel really uncomfortable and that's what you should feel. The rape/torture scene is tough to watch and you pretty much want to stop watching the movie at that time. If the movie swerved from this point and did something original, it would have been cool. I've seen the original and it's a mess as well, but this is suppose to be an updated remake. Not retread. I was expecting something cool and new. Dangit, I was expecting too much. Oh and the logic behind this movie....Jennifer isn't a big girl at all. But we are suppose to believe that she is strong enough to choke out a mentally challenged boy who was earlier strong enough to force her to the ground. We are also suppose to believe that she could carry another grown man and tie him to a bathtub. Jennifer might weigh 90 pounds at the most. She's a writer and supposedly she survived in the woods for a month after falling naked into a dirty pool with gaters. Question. How come her clothes are completely clean? Wait, where did she get clothes? She was naked when they thought she was killed! She not only has clothes (which were burned when they thought she was dead) but boots that were her perfect size and are just as clean. I suppose she found them in the woods along with lye. Lye? Yeah, that's something you find when you go camping. When did she get a chance to wash her hair? The water didn't work in her cabin that well. But she had enough clean water to torture someone and shower. OK, when she's ready to take on the main guy of the trio, again, she supposedly carried a grown man and was able to hang him on the ceiling. Again, she has a change of clothes...from where!?!!? Oh and how is she strong enough to pull someone's teeth out? Oh and how can you choke someone out for HOURS (this is in regards to the last murder) and then have them wake up. Again, she's able to carry people all over the place, rig traps and hoists like she's a professional carpenter, and talk like she's the baddest woman on the planet.I could go on and on about how unrealistic this is. The title character's name is Jennifer Hills and if anyone tells you to watch this movie with them, HEAD FOR THE HILLS!! The opposite one that isn't playing this movie.",I Spit on Your Grave

This film looks clean and professional, some of the acting is quite good. Ms. Butler and Mr. Branson especially. Effects are very good. What made the original so effectual was the sunshine, the playful music, and the way the men talking about Jennifer started so much more innocently than it ended. They seemed like they hadn't done this before. Here the film is dark from the get go. The atmosphere, the music, the boys, are all screaming, 'bad things happens here'. These boys torture here methodically (psychologically) before touching her, and they look very well practiced. For me that detracted. Then Jennifer gets her own back. She is creepy, yes. Violent fulfillment, yes. But it's unrealistic for such a realistic film. It becomes exploitative in a way the original didn't. Any way around it. Highly recommend for those with nerve, but the original is altogether a darker, more meaningful piece.",I Spit on Your Grave
222,EndlessUniverse,"A pointless remake, but better than most.",5,10 March 2019,"A remake of the 1978 film of the same name, this update contains the same story of the original while not being an exact copy.""I Spit on Your Grave"" follows the character Jennifer, a female writer coming from a big city, who makes her way south to a more isolated, wooded town. Planning to spend a month in a cabin alone to work on her next novel, she catches the attention of 5 men who stalk, torment, assault, and finally gang rape her. Being left for dead in a creek, Jennifer resurfaces to seek bloody vengeance.Much like the original, this remake is incredibly difficult to sit through. Scenes of rape and violence are directed as raw as you would expect from the material . You feel the complete helplessness of Jennifer's character during the first half and there is some satisfaction to be found in the gruesome ways she murders her attackers. Credit must be given to the cast for playing these roles so believably. Most notably Sarah Butler as the protagonist, who generates equal parts vulnerability and strength for the character exceptionally well. Right up there with Camille Keaton.What holds the film back though is the attempt to modernize the material in its style.The 1978 film almost came off as a war documentary in its execution. Raw, grimy, and with no filter. A result of the low budget, no doubt, but that lack of cinematic polish made the events feel more real. The remake comes across more like a conventional horror film of the moden day, in terms of framing, cinematography, and pacing.The music follows the same path, with the obvious stings and scare chords you'd expect from any contemporary horror film. The original, on the other hand, completely omitted any non digetic sound. While I don't think either way is wrong, I do feel that the '78 film's approach worked better for the material.There are also additions and omissions in the writing that weakens the film. The rape sequence isn't anywhere near as drawn out as the original, which makes it easier to sit through, but also loses much of the impact.The second half strangely follows the antagonists, showing details on their cover-up of the crime and their family lives. When Jennifer finally comes back into the picture, it's structured just like a typical slasher, with the audience and soon to be victims wondering just when the killer will show up. The scenes of murder are extremely graphic, but even they're flawed in that Jennifer spews out one liners related to each victim's death, making the tone uneven.Clearly I have mixed feelings on this film. While the material was handled as well as it probably could've been in this day and age, it is a simple rape and revenge story. You go into it knowing exactly what to expect.If you're a fan of the rape and revenge or torture porn subgenres, I would recommend this film.If not, then you aren't missing much in skipping it.",I Spit on Your Grave

In this go around story is about the same, pretty female writer rents a secluded cabin to write a novel. Four losers and a mentally challenged man terrorize, rape and try to kill her. She revenges herself on all the creeps. The big difference is in this movie she tortures and kills the men in disturbing, sick ways. Any sympathy we may have felt for her is totally gone by the end. We're left with a psycho who appears to enjoy killing too much.Do yourself a favor and watch the original. It's more realistic, gritty, better acted, believable and satisfying.",I Spit on Your Grave

I too have been sick of the countless remakes of old horror movies Hollywood has been churning out the past couple of years,but this was just as intense, if not more than the original. Decent acting all the way around, very intense, disturbing, and the revenge scenes in this movie parallel anything seen in any of the Saw or Hostel movies. This movie also avoided what a lot of horror movies do nowadays, which is adding an extremely obnoxious score and loud bursts of musical sound effects every time we are supposed to be scared. The score is more subdued, making the film feel more like you are actually there. I definitely recommend this one for those not faint of heart.",I Spit on Your Grave

But remake it they have and the storyline is a mirror image of the original but for some reason this new version doesn't seem to be as nasty as the original. The reasons for this might have to do with the fact that the actors can actually act, its shot in a cleaner, more professional manner and maybe most importantly of all : we are just not that shocked by anything anymore. With more and more films pushing the boundaries of violence and gore, this just doesn't offend as much as the original did in its day. Having said that its still a tough watch and anybody not familiar with the original and not a fan of this genre will find its extended torture and intimidation scenes very difficult to stomach, but with a title like I Spit On Your Grave this movie will only attract a certain type of viewer.",I Spit on Your Grave

232,CinemaDan,It Is What It Is! A Great Revenge Flick!,8,16 April 2011,"Wow! What do I say about this movie? It's a retelling/remake of the original cult classic from 1978. This movie (as did the original) deals with rape, torture and murder. Both movies have been highly criticized. Even Roger Ebert (Who I usually agree with) has given both movies a zero star rating and has called the original a ""vile bag of garbage"". Now there have been an equal number of supporters (of the original movie) that have defended the movie as well, a lot who call it a misunderstood masterpiece. People who are against this movie say that it's man hating (and there are reports of some men walking out of the theater in disgust at both of the movies) and some also say the movie glorifies violence against women (I do not see any glorification at all, as a matter of fact... CinemaDan (sorry... first person reference) wanted to jump through the screen and kill these guys himself.) Now there is the opposite side of this discussion who defend the movie and say it is all about women and empowerment! This has been debated for like thirty-two years now... whatever!! If a movie causes this much discussion .. then fantastic! This is what art is all about. Discussion is good. Not discussing.. That's where the problem's come into this world. I understand the subject matter in this movie is sensitive to some viewer's. Hence... this is not for those viewers. My goal and review of this movie is as a genre fan of the original and how the remake played out.Here ya go:I put this right up there with the remake of ""Last House On The Left"". I really enjoyed it! It's a popcorn flick. I myself still find the 6'o'clock news more horrifying then anything ""Hollywood"" glorifies. We live by our stories and are entertained by them. And.. I am sorry... but right now if there was a car crash outside your window you know you are running to see what happened and maybe even get a camera to take pictures and show people.. ""Hey I was there man.. look"" So anyway, this movie was great! The first hour you are horrified, the brutality, the way it is shot, it's uneasy, uncomfortable.. kind of like.. why am I watching this?... But then... The second half!!! Oh Yeah!! This is why!!! BAD ASS!!!!!Also, Some great iconic lines that you will repeat!!!!Again... this is not for everyone.. But... for those who know me AND.... listen to me when I say this... AND.... CAN handle.... the first half... will cheer at the second.. I Promise you!Also.. I highly recommend the making of documentary and behind the scenes feature that is on the DVD. Some of these actors will impress you with how different they are in real life as opposed to their character portrayals. Oh and Sarah Butler..... if you ever read this... Great job! Amazing performance on such a grueling subject yet great revenge flick! Here is a quote I totally agree with and could not say any better. This is from Paul McCannibal from dreadcentral.com""From my standpoint, ISOYG 2010 sits squarely on the good side of remakes. Very good, in fact. I should clarify that by ""good"" I mean well executed, punishing, and viciously rewarding. If you've got the stomach for this kind of thing, and you can endure the horribly unpleasant and drawn-out rape/degradation scene, you'll be ratcheted into a headspace that is screaming for retribution. The bad guys in this movie are so despicable that you will have absolutely no qualms with seeing them get what is coming to them.""",I Spit on Your Grave

Nobody even has a grave they actually stay in. It sounds like it was a committee of 14-year olds that came up with the title. That said, I have to admit the torture scenes are the most watchable, even enjoyable, I've ever seen, I mean after sitting through what these animals do to that poor woman. And I hate torture scenes.

And the pay back was pretty 'fitting' exactly how i hoped it would be. I like how u can see how innocent she was and how brutal she became. Great acting on everyone. There's really nothing i didn't like about it. I don't think i had any spoilers in it just some minor ones but i checked the box just in-case.

Later, she jumps in a dirty river after being raped, and disappears under the surface: she returns to avenge her rapists a few days later, but NOTHING about how she survived the river is revealed. The lack of anger she demonstrates while methodically killing her rapists is incongruent with the mercilessness of the sadistically sophisticated manner in which she kills them.

As the heroine stacks and lures her prey, to their ends.I feel there are many things wrong with this type of film, but the main one is the principle. I feel the film simply tries say if someone gets raped and they get revenge that victim WINS, it simply doesn't work that way barring the tremendous psychical damage the female character endures the psychological damage would be far greater yet this is never shown or implied. Sadly what is shown is a supposedly empowered female getting revenge and winning as she sits on the swing having dispatched of all her tormentors.No doubt rape and revenge flicks can make for interesting, shocking and effective movies like Irreversible. I spit on your grave was the first one I saw and its remake pays homage to that unfortunately it stays to true to the original although quality and acting has improved, the evolution from a cinematography and psychological perspective were clearly needed.

Usually remakes do terrible compared to the original. I was thinking about not even seeing it because the 1978 version was just pure trash and didn't deserve much credit. Now when I saw this I was amazed. There were scenes where you should cover your eyes if you are very sensitive with gore and torture. Unlike other slashers, and horrors, this one drags you in with the less music it has. It makes you feel like you are there. This is a great revenge movie. I would recommended it if your into Saw, Hostel, Even Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino films like Kill Bill, and Machete and other movies in that genre that have a lot of grossness in them.",I Spit on Your Grave
249,red81468,Totally Destroyed Movie,1,21 January 2011,"I Spit on Your Grave was years ahead of its time in 1978. It was and sadly remains the best rape/revenge movie of all time. Stuart Morse has totally ruined this move be taking out the reality and trying to make a SAW inspired film. This remake does not even come close. Here is why:(1978): the rapist stalk her through the woods and raper repeatedly as she tries to get back to her cabin where they leave her for dead. (2010): the rape happens in her cabin and leads to the wood, to a bridge that is not high enough to kill her..(1978): she recovers in her cabin and plans her revenge. (2010): she recovers in an abandoned house in the woods and becomes JIGSAW.(1978): she uses seduction to lure them in to her trap. (2010): she kidnaps them and some how this tiny woman carries them all to the house in the woods.(1978): the men don't think that what they did was wrong and that in some way she enjoyed it, this adds to their mindset. (2010): they know they did wrong and want to keep it hidden.The addition of the camera and the fifth rapist were points that made this movie totally unrealistic.",I Spit on Your Grave
250,tausiscool,Flawlessly crafted and very slick revenge movie,9,11 January 2018,"This remake is surprisingly well executed (excuse the pun)! The suspense builds in a slick and stylish fashion and all the actors playing their parts brilliantly (even the weird little hillbilly old man- this performance is probably very accurate in fact, haha).The director builds hatred in the viewer against the rapists by the prolonged scenes of sexual injustice. This makes the revenge all the more satisfying and the way the violence is carried out is super entertaining. The director uses the same technique of anticipation and gratification in ISOYG 2 (which is also a decent watch) but in that film there is pointless dialogue to pad the film out when it really doesn't need it. In This classic remake however, every moment is golden and necessary. Top marks to the maker who clearly understood the genre and how to do it right, avoiding the trap of diluting the film through moral and ethical cliché. Lets not talk about the third ISOYG as by then he seems to have moved away from all that made this one great. What was he thinking?! So much credit for this though, superb.",I Spit on Your Grave
251,cecilbarton,My pick for a good horror flick!,7,2 August 2011,"I Spit on Your Grave is very well done and the camera work is quite charming. Sarah Butler did a great job at playing the sexy, pothead novelist, Jennifer Hill. Out of all of the 'revenge' movies I have seen this one has to be the one to draw me in most. Some of the scenes are so morbid that you can't look away, no matter how much you want to- Scenes of blood, human skin being eaten away, and even castration- Quite difficult to stomach for most viewers, but definitely attracts a certain audience that seeks gruesome footage, but done most tastefully. This movie easily earns an 8/10 because it does what most modern horror movies don't do- Sure, it makes you cringe in disgust, but at the same time you draw a connection with the protagonist, and I feel that's something senseless blood and guts movies look past.",I Spit on Your Grave

The whole storyline is cheesy and the acting is poor. Woman gets raped and then seeks revenge. -wow cool! You can rather compare that film to a horribly sick porn movie than a horror film.Not only that you see that poor girl getting raped about 3/4 of the film - also her revenge is stupid and impossible. She changes clothes that were burnt after she was raped, she drags heavy men around and tortures them, the conversations are horribly stupid and the acting is poor quality. I didn't expect much of the film but I was still surprised how low something can get.

253,jake-flys-helos,Effectively scratches that sadistic revenge itch,8,2 October 2019,"The violence is sufficiently well-acted and well-filmed that it need not be super graphic. There will be no mistaking what's happening to the characters and how they feel about it, even without explicitly seeing. You may be unsatisfied if your expectation is to see graphic gore. The gore is visualized in the after effects, not during the action itself. That said, the gory effects are well-made.
My disappointment with the film lies in the story itself. The plot is weak, but straightforward and uncomplicated. After the climactic final kill, there is no falling action or resolution. It's just straight to roll credits.
Remakes of older films are usually known to update the original story to include more modern technology and reflect the social climate. There was little of that in this film.
The movie was entertaining. I would have liked it better with a final scene. My ending would have Jennifer driving out of town, back to civilization, with a little satisfied smirk on her face. also a short shot showing the sheriff's daughter was not harmed, and another copy of the tape delivered to the sheriff's wife.",I Spit on Your Grave
254,RReak1946,Gore Porn,3,10 April 2014,"I like my low budget films and this one, masquerading as a 'horror' of sorts seemed to start off promisingly. The idea of some young woman going out of her way to cut herself off from the world, inhabiting some dangerously isolated cabin, and then frolicking around half naked in the grounds was a bit hard to believe but I set that aside and gave it the benefit of the doubt. Then these guys break into her house - obviously!!!! - and I am subjected to a 30 minute (or more) rape scene, during which my wife gets up and leaves the room despite my protestations about giving it the benefit of the doubt and telling her I'm sure it'll kick in with a good story soon!...to no avail! She gets thoroughly raped in every possible way (the woman in the film, not my wife), and then escapes! Only to come back and murder each man one by one. There's no real challenge to it either, she seems to have concocted a perfect plan for each revenge torture killing, and - no matter how elaborate - they all go down perfectly. Not enough of a story for me, but a lot of gore porn for those that like that sort of thing.",I Spit on Your Grave

But when you are a woman, and subjected to the violence as portrayed in this movie, I can only say: Her actions are therapeutic. I wished more woman in the real world would behave like this, instead of remaining a victim. Woman have been under suppression for thousands of years. It's time they stand up and teach male macho's a good lesson. Celtic woman 2000 years ago were a good example. I found the acting quit real. Yes there are crazy men who behave like this. Stupid men who like to abuse their power. And yes there are woman who don't take it all and revolt. It's not like a horror movie to me. More like movie about setting wrong things right.

257,leonardoervatti,Enjoyable Vengeance Trip - Talion Law,10,13 April 2021,"The first time I saw the film I was disturbed by the shocking scenes.However, as the film went on, I was shocked at how delighted I was with the vengeful sadism of the main character.When I finished the film, I was even more shocked to read the reviews. I felt a tone of hypocrisy in most of them. Some with this point of view:""the film has a false sense of moral equivalence"", ""if I rape someone, I have committed a crime. However, if you kill me, you will be committing another"".Analyzing such criticisms based on ethics, they even make sense.However, I doubt that if that happened to us, we would not have the same sense of justice, or rather, the more well-known ""law of talion"" - eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.The film takes the principle of talion to the letter, revealing a disturbing, emotional, almost pleasurable and sadistic journey into the sweet revenge of a rape victim.",I Spit on Your Grave
258,jesse-darvas,Way inferior to the original,4,22 August 2011,"There are some funny parts in this movie if you don't take them too seriously: the torture scenes that seem taken right out of a Jigsaw installment. Apart from that addition (the other addition being the implausible ""assman"" sheriff who is ready to rape and murder any girl from the city just because he's a redneck)the film adds nothing to the original but substracts a lot. The first film was actually quite comparable to Deliverance by J Boorman: it steadily built tension. The actress (Camille Keaton) was remarkable. The other guys had some kind of plausible stupidity.This one is more a ""torture porn"" flick. Too many long scenes in between: for the same kind of enjoyment, better watch Hostel or any of the Saw movies. The subplot with the Sheriff trying to cover up the murder is not necessary. What is striking is that the film is far tamer than the original in the rape scenes, but far more gruesome and graphic in the revenge scenes. It seems people are not able to stomach a long and credible rape scene but can watch without any qualms eyes being plucked by crows, faces burnt in acid or blown to pieces by a shotgun. That is very telling about the morals of our society.",I Spit on Your Grave

This certainly complimented the original and then took it to a whole new level. Acting is much better, the pacing is certainly improved, characters are more refined, sound design is crisp, cinematically it is right in your face and looks great, all the motivations of the characters make sense, and there are certainly a few unpredictable surprises. While some woman may have a hard time getting through the rape scene...close your eyes for a minute and please stick around. The revenge turn will make any man cover their groin and cringe nervously.

The woman has punished even the disability man. Too stupid for me and I am tolerant to movies. It is the only film in my life which I did not felt sorry for what happened to the woman.

Yet, this is one of the sickest revenge movies i've watched in recent times. The plot, albeit a bit predictable, was fairly nice and the acting was okay to good at times. It is one of those gruesome films that ADULTS ONLY can watch and go ""oohh"" & ""ahhh"" while not eating of course. Although men might check to make sure their testicles are in tact at some point during the film and women might feel deep pity or anger during as well, both men and women should feel good because of the way things turn out. It was good in terms of sound and the special effects were nice as the blood and gore seemed realistic and quite graphic most of the time.

I personally know several women who won't watch this because it has rape in it. Rape, regardless of what the 'story' is, is horrible & traumatic and to some, it's too personal. In almost all movies, the strong female roll is (at some point in life) raped. I also know many men who won't watch this because it's simply another movie casting men as rapists.At any rate, if that is the extent of your talent, a tired old scenario of another wronged woman out for revenge, perhaps you should see if McDonalds is hiring.",I Spit on Your Grave

This film was very graphic and I can imagine disturbing to the more sensitive right wing, Christian population who might view it as gratuitous or pornography; it isn't. Rape is violent; it is brutal; it isn't over in a minute; and a little soap and water doesn't wash it away. It doesn't necessarily happen only to ""loose women or bad girls"" and that is what makes this movie unsettling to others.

Not only is this just some gruesome and pointless movie, but completely unrealistic.I think people who commit serious crimes should get the death penalty and preferably without some long delay in between sentencing and just get it over with. Do it right after sentencing with a shotgun to the face. Save so much money that way.Anyway, the whole woman getting revenge deal is what has me hating this movie. Completely unrealistic how a woman who just got raped...twice...would just try and get revenge and somehow be some badass and overcome multiple men.I didn't even try watching the whole movie. I skimmed through parts along the way and hated every second of it. Sure, I guess if you like pointless and gruesome movies like Saw, then this might be for you. If you have a brain and like to use it to watch decent movies, then avoid this one at all costs.Truly a garbage movie. Even ""Irreversible"" is a rather horrifying movie with it's long rape scene, but it at least feels like a movie instead of whatever this is.I gave it a 2 just for it's creativity with the torturing.",I Spit on Your Grave

The torture scenes were also so unbelievable, the contraptions she comes up with are pretty elaborate for a city girl who couldn't get the water running at the beginning of the movie.

If you haven't watched the movie go do it. This i'll point out though; notice that the critics argue/discuss the moral/theme of the story. Not plot,direction,editing,screenplay(incl. dialog),characters,setting,execution etc. This owes to the piece being perfect on each one. Director Steven Monroe(Babylon 5, The Wonder Years) and writer Jeffrey Reddick (Final Destination series, Day of the dead) plus their all too perfect cast make sure sure of that. Roger Ebert is left, unlike in the original, to site only the defecating(according o him) moral premise. Past great films that have received same 'finger of human gods' style of criticism include Scarface, Psycho, Dirty Harry, True Romance, Pulp fiction, kill bill, The Godfather, Natural Born Killers, Reservoir dogs,Heat, se7en and many more. If a critic is arguing on the morality of a film, then it goes to confirm the filmmakers having done their JOB. Really, think about it. Audiences need to get around this and take it as not being asked to forsake a viewing of it, but as encouragement to have a looksie and decide on their own. See if the critic is right.more or less. It is the promise of having to test and ultimately choose whether the theme being crusaded stands on its own against an audiences perception of what life is or should be. that should any filmmaker endow us with a vision that rises above mediocrity and equivocal statements of a films intended purpose, to give us a clear stand on how they see the world by the way their heroes re/act, is the very essence of the medium. i'm a film lover and I say this is one of the best of such work to come out of late!

273,simic79,Refreshingly good work... for a remake,7,16 January 2013,"Few months ago, while i was getting ready to watch this one, i choose to watch the original once again. I remember the acting, few scenes but nothing besides, so i figured it would be better to remind myself. And that was a mistake, like always in original-remake connection. Original is much, much better in almost every aspect. Allow me to start from Jennifer Hills. Sarah Butler is a beautiful girl, very good actress, and she played the role very well, i have no doubts about that. But, i must say i am not convinced with her transformation. Her's writer job-i am not buying it. Definitely not buying the other part of her, and she is not the one to blame for that. I suppose that there are a few actresses that fit this role perfectly. Besides that, Sarah did her work magnificently, and i cant wait to see her somewhere else. The other ones, complete failure. Retard is maybe on spot, sheriff close, other ones was missed. Simply, they just don't seem like guys from town.The movie itself, is good... if you did not see the original.Every comparison between original and remake is at the side of the original. This one plays at steady pace, not rushing anything, that i liked. Then again, some scenes are too long, without any purpose, some, on the other hand, are too short. The other part of the movie we watch from quite different angle. There we see strange connection between sheriff and the other guys, which is at some points pretty unexplainable, but also irrelevant for the purpose of the movie. When the big show starts, once again, i am not convinced. And again, i blame the original for it. Anyway, show goes well, every scene is packed out well, and that is it. The last scene should not be there, as there is pretty obvious that the movie did not managed to follow whole story to its origins, and did not recognized Jennifers feelings like it should have. It is her story. At the big picture, it does not look bad, i find it pretty refreshing in the sea of the bad remakes, so it is definitely worth watching.",I Spit on Your Grave
274,demon74,The original fails to top the remake,10,21 April 2011,I spit on your grave is a top notch revenge movie and the remake owned the original in many ways. In this masterpiece we got a young writer from NY who wants to get away from the city and have relaxation time and to write her book of course this sounds to good to be true. In the movie she finds some suspicious men and basically gets tortured and raped. The comparison of this and the original is that the viciousness and characters have changed. In the original they did not make a good attempt to cover their horrific deed but this one they do also a corrupt cop is in on this too. another thing they decrease the rape scene which was great on their in my book and finally which I was impressed the character of the victim changed big time from a nice girl into a angry blood thirsty avenger. This is a awesome movie where critics say its trash due to the nature where I believe this is a inspiring film for women who dealt with this situation. This is a must see of course the nature of this is graphic but a suspenseful masterpiece of terror and heroism in one bundle.,I Spit on Your Grave

Again,when she went to visit the wife and daughter... how she have the good dress? and make up in other parts of the movie? jumping backwards from a high bridge barely you can survive? maybe she did it but I will wake up in a hospital.

276,mr-tobias-jansson,Lacks the human impact of the original,5,17 June 2011,"Like one previous reviewer scribed - this is a film about exacting revenge in it's purest form without any remorse or compassion for the people you target; about deliberately putting aside all of your humanity in order to do what you feel is justified. I can relate to it, so can just about anyone who is NOT Mother Teresa. That said this movie is nothing more than another violent fair cashing in on an already established classic without ever trying to say or make anything new out of it. It's not a re-interpretation. It's not a re-imagining. It's just violence for the sake of blood mongering. I love horror, and detailed acts of sadistic violence can be put to good use if the movie has a deeper meaning and purposeful intent. Since Meir Zarchi was actually involved in the process of making this film I'm starting to believe that his 1978 classic was nothing but a fluke. That movie became an emotional and thought provoking journey into the darkest corners of the human soul because it depicted what people, mostly good ones, are actually capable of doing in a given situation. And I'm talking, of course, about BOTH sides of the crime. The antagonists of the original were pretty ordinary guys who saw a chance and actually did what some (not all though) might have fantasized about but never did. Failed group dynamics, you might say. That same movie also got you thinking: Why would I never do that? Is it because I'm afraid of hurting another person... or is because I'm afraid of getting caught? Scary thoughts, huh?! The only one ever getting a touch of real life personality in this movie is sheriff Storch. He has a family and has probably never done anything like this before, even though he might have fantasized about it and maybe even became a cop purely for the sake of social credibility, and made a terrible detour to a cost greater than he could ever imagine. Johnny though, is an uncleaned psycho from the very beginning and I'm very surprised he managed to stay out of prison for so long. And the sheriff would never be able to protect such a person for that long without losing his public support. Besides, Johnny has way to much charisma for the type of sociopath he's supposed to be. It's not believable and it's not scary. And Sarah Butler's Ms. Hill isn't portrayed as much of a human being either. She rather quickly becomes a cute victim of a rather cleaned up ordeal compared to the original and soon becomes an almost supernatural killing machine with hissing voice and glaring eyes and smirking psychotic intellect. Wheres in the original she used her femininity, that very same femininity that jolted and confused her perpetrators, as a weapon to bring her them about their demise. These days the world really could have used a movie making us ask questions about our own sexual nature. There is so much confusion about the connection between sex, the power of control, affection and love. I obviously looked in the wrong direction on this one. I really didn't have much hope for this movie and unfortunately my predictions were rather correct. But I'm sure a lot of people will find this enjoyable in a sense.",I Spit on Your Grave

And is far from the grind-house, low budget original.But I believe that fans of the original movie will enjoy this remake. The rape scene is just a harrowing as the original and still very graphic. And the way that she exacts her revenge is much more cunning and twisted, the death scenes are very well thought out.If you like the original or are a fan of teen horror films you'll love this.

281,taylorarod,So much for equality...,3,9 December 2011,"First off, I skimmed through most of the first part. I watched a big portion of the rape scene and saw the entire revenge plot. Let me first say this: rape is evil...I know. I have encountered many who have been raped and molested...both female and MALE. A few reviews above me, someone said something that truly relieved me, ""What would a girl have to do to a guy to deserve such cruel and sadistic torture?"" The answer from most, especially the female population, is ""in no way would a girl deserve such pain and torture."" So, here's my question...where's the equality? Think about what happened in the film. She was brutally raped and beaten...yes. However, she walked off. She had enough strength to escape. She came back later completely healed, at least physically, from whatever happened to her. Now, I'm all for the ""eye for an eye"" mentality, but does this fit that picture? Does torturing 5 people beyond what they tortured you and killing them equate to an eye for an eye? That would be like a girl kicking a guy in the crotch and, in return, getting slammed with a baseball bat. The problem with today's society is that people have no problem portraying men as the evil villains when, in reality, there are quite a few female devils as well. To make this film feasible, it would have to be accepted if the situation were reversed. If a group of females beat down and humiliated a guy, would he be authorized ""just revenge"". And, if he did, would the females out there accept that and feel a sense of relief for his vengeance? I HIGHLY doubt it. Moral of the story: Society is twisted. Personally, if the situation was reversed, I would still feel bad for the culprits. The same people who agree with the torture of these men are the ones who protest against the torture of terrorists and insurgents. What makes killing many innocent people less severe than beating down and sexually assaulting one person? Nothing, yet we do not accept torture as a means of revenge. Why, we are better than that. Basically, this movie upset me and disturbed me for quite some time because it did not show a realistic or ""fair"" form of revenge. Especially considering the revenge resulted in 5 gruesome deaths when the original rape consisted of one injured individual. Another war reference, we get attacked on 9/11 and thousands die? Would it be right to bomb the whole country and kill as many of them as possible? I think not. I don't mean to throw the whole Christian thing in here, but is all that violence and revenge really necessary? She prays to God before committing acts of unspeakable evil? You messed with my teeth, so I'm going to pull out yours! Also, I'm going to cut your d*ck off because I am a female and I can get away with it! In conclusion, this film is best suited for narrow-minded, sadistic feminists who love the idea of taking things to the extreme and displaying true ""girl power"". This movie, albeit a remake, is just another reason why there is still societal struggles regarding the mistreatment of men versus women.",I Spit on Your Grave
282,razberryjam,lots of suspense with a touch of gore,9,20 January 2012,"I disagree with some of the negative reviews about this film. I liked it. It was tense, sick in places, and allowed you to identify with the characters just enough to enjoy seeing what happens to them. I would compare it to films such as Funny Games and Last House On The Left. It may put you off staying alone in log cabin however and contains scenes that may upset some viewers, but if you've seen the Saw films and weird ones like the Human Centipede, i doubt it'll come across as anything new. That is to say it is a remake, and if i remember correctly, the two are fairly similar. Probably not a film you'd want to watch with the girlfriend if you were planning on a 'cosy' night in.",I Spit on Your Grave
283,arundekev,Previous reviewers are dumb.,8,12 July 2014,"This was not really a bad movie. The acting was good. The storyline follows this genre. It's not supposed to be Schindler's List or anything.....it is a remake of a 70's cult movie. Whoever said it was pornography is either stupid, or has never seen the original. This movie contains 1/10th the nudity and rape of the original. I liked this movie and there was very little nudity......lots of violence, but that is what the movie is about. How dumb are the people writing reviews on here. I will challenge ANY critic. Excellent cinematography, excellent acting,believable storyline.....and regardless of what these asses say......minimal nudity... Screw you, good movie!!!",I Spit on Your Grave
284,cowls7168187,Still no spitting after 30 years....,8,2 November 2012,"As the title suggests, it's quite ""gravey"". As with any movies you want to criticize, it is a courtesy to watch the trailer first, as with this movie, it is not specifically designed for ""all ages"" or ""all kinds of audience"".Overall, this is a very good example of remake. The casting was nearly perfect, with exceptional performance for Matthew and Sheriff. Some of the characters have ""switched"" from 1978, with Sheriff being a family guy instead of Johnny being one. I was very impressed at the subtlety of this character switch and how the movie managed to pull the characters together even better.The 1978 film justified the guys' actions as ""excusable"", claiming that Jennifer gave ""signals"" to the guys, that are ""undeniable"" to straight men. The remake film focused more softly on sexual attraction of Jennifer, but more on the way Jennifer was ""treated"" (having no boyfriend or any other parties to accompany her). The softer focus on Jennifer's sexual attraction failed to create this fantasy about ""city girls"". The movie could have zoomed on a perky cleavage, at worst.Jennifer's revenge is fired back in tenfold violence, yet her efforts to remain ""soft on ears"" just didn't work well; I would have preferred to hear Jennifer with more demeaning, sadistic, and angrier voice.In masculine perspective, it felt understandable about these 4 guys' views of ""city girls"" and ""small town dirts"". The way they treated Jennifer, the words they said to her, will be repeated back to the guys ""appropriately"". This helped create the sense of what revenge really is about, unlike the 1978 film where Jennifer's violence just seems random and impulsive.The most ""unpleasant"" outcome of the movie is the fate of Matthew. It just didn't make me feel ""right"" about what Jennifer did to him. This ended up failing to achieve a ""Sweet & Satisfying Revenge"" award, if you get the joke. In my opinion, the revenge on Matthew actually made me feel sorry for him.There are two things that felt left out, which would have helped the audience more satisfied. First is Chastity's whereabouts and her fate at the end. Will Chastity grow up and revenge her dad? (Maybe a hint of sequel?) Second thing is the ending. My preferred ending would be Jennifer saying ""That's what you get for ****ing with a City Girl, you piece of dirt!"" and spitting on the guys.",I Spit on Your Grave
285,cruther-638-59479,Repulsive!,1,13 October 2019,"I love how one of the actors in this cast is now an ""Advocate"" for all kinds of different causes. Wasn't an advocate to take on this film, was he? Just proof that the system is rigged..",I Spit on Your Grave
286,KracKils,Amazing movie and I hope other reviews don't make you shy away.,9,13 October 2013,"I've never written a movie review before but after reading several within the ""best"" category that didn't even come close to what I experienced I felt compelled to at least try to provide people a different perspective.You have to go into this knowing it's a revenge horror flick. Many comments and reviews state her revenge was sadistic or too over the top but when you compare it to torture/gore flicks of this age such as Saw or Hostel I think it was appropriately somewhat tame. Yes, you're gonna experience the hopelessness and lack of control of rape but that's the point. It triggers something in most of us which makes you connect with the character more than nearly any experience but then that leads to a gratuitous satisfaction when justice is served.I didn't watch this for many years just because it was rape oriented but I had no idea how much depth went into it. I can't even imagine how difficult it was for any involved to film these scenes as emotionally and artistically as they did. I highly recommend this film but you have to approach it as an experience.",I Spit on Your Grave
287,lanalorenzen-665-83361,"Very good writing, editing, directing, and acting.",8,9 November 2019,"I caught this film on Amazon Prime recently and was impressed with the script, the editing, the directing but most especially the acting. There isn't much suspense because the viewer already knows what's going to happen to the protagonist. I do admit it could have been more suspenseful, especially when the woman returns from the ""dead."" The punishments were fitting to the crimes--after all, the sheriff was going to kill her:intent is nine-tenths of the law. The movie held my attention throughout which is rare (most acclaimed movies, like the Peanut Butter Falcon and Get Out bore me to tears). I was very impressed with the actor who played the Sheriff. I found online that he is a Welsh actor. That explains it. It's almost just worth the time and effort to watch his performance.",I Spit on Your Grave
288,dvcooldlt,The Horror of Rape for all sick perverts..!!,9,30 April 2013,"If u don;t like to know just anything about the movie.. then this could be a spoiler for u.. so ""SPOILER ALERT"" Just finished watching the movie, & came on IMDb to see more about it.. and then i saw a stupid man's review on the movie so i decided to register and tell the real truth.. this movie ain't a comedy flick or something.. nor you can relate it to some stupid entertainment.. this is reality.. No fancy lighting. No mood music hanging in the background. Simply, the horror of rape. The story is about the victim who was horribly tortured and raped. but mostly it was about her revenge on those who committed that horrible crime. i have seen movies like Saw, The hills have eyes, etc. but this one was with a message. And the one who will see this movie will definitely get the message like never before. And i would like to say that RAPE IS A TRULY HORRIBLE CRIME! Horrible beyond what most of us could ever imagine. I rate it 9 out of 10. And request IMDb to put this one instead of the one that give wrong information to the viewers.",I Spit on Your Grave
289,evilguitarfagot,"Leave your brains at the door, and get through the first hour.",8,1 November 2013,"This movie was fantastic. I thoroughly enjoyed the torture scenes. However the first half of the movie you have to stomache through. I was about ready to turn the movie off but I stuck with it and I must say. It was a piece of excellence. I'm a fan of ""sadistic torture"" and the ending was very gratifying.The dialogue is terrible. Most of what Ms. Mills says and the way the actor portrayed it came off as ""not real enough"". However she succeeds in bringing a fantastic end to it all.There are a lot of holes in the plot and a lot leaves left to be explained, all I can say is 'don't think about it and enjoy the gore.'I originally watched this movie because my friend made a joke about it after I quoted ICP's ""Jump Around"" 'I got sick jokes for you, they're not fun, f*ck you in the as* with a shotgun' Yes somebody get's f*cked in the as* with a shotgun. It's at the end. Stick with it. It's very satisfying.",I Spit on Your Grave
290,poyson_gyrl,this film makes a realistic point of society.,8,10 June 2016,"First of all, i want to make a point about the value of a film as a work of art. The production and the directing might not be the best BUT it's a move based on realistic facts that you might called them tragic. I like the fact that this movie makes a point of the relationship between victims-authorities-rapists, you might call this tragic but it s the truth. This movie made it to picture the truths without including sexism. The story focuses on the character that is willing to get the justice so much but society is not capable of doing this, leading her into an obsession for making things right from a victim's point of view. If you think that this movie says that ""men are monsters for doing this to women so women can kill them"" your level of understanding is below under-mediocre. The facts sais that in USA, 3 of 100 rapist get in jail. THIS IS A SHAMEFUL FACT OF THE WORLD. What a surprise, the movie shows low interest for making people alive get their justice, unless someone is dead, and if the dead person is a criminal, they stop getting any justice for the victims. This movie has the courage to say that we have trouble into getting justice. The criminals today can do wrong, and the system still allows them to be free, leading to no justice and more victims. Sad...but the truth is ugly!",I Spit on Your Grave

If the start wasn't so slow and the killing would have been a bigger and longer part of the movie, I would have given it an 8/10!It's not that amazing but I recommend you watch it just for the amazing torture scene's",I Spit on Your Grave

Just a warning if seeing a female getting raped in a horrific way will make you cry, do not watch this. this movie is not for the weak hearted.

294,annabellavance,Be carful.... what you alow your soul,8,23 February 2019,"First of all , this movie was presented to me in a verry mysterious way.
i felt force to keep watching so i could feel her satisfaction
The scenes were horribles .
You can't just change the movie and focus on something else , you won't be able to forget or not to try anticipate the next massacre their about to show you
This movie is full of dead curses and nasty spiritual parasites
Do not recommend this movie
I wanted to see , by respect for her devastating adventure
If you watch the begging you have no choice but to wait for the end .
The scenes were non-stop violence and the script was made by a sexually frustrated person with alot of control issues
I think this is the kind of movie that let you with a thousand pounds of heavy emptiness and make you feel like you wanna puke you'r feeling and mercy tills you start to feel guilty for even though about continuing the danm movie
The plaisir you get when she's makes everybody pay is a sins .Go to church after this movie and pray the universe forgiveness",I Spit on Your Grave
