0,SnoopyStyle,madcap caper doesn't quite work,5,13 December 2015,"Eddie 'Hudson Hawk' Hawkins (Bruce Willis) gets out of prison after 10 years. He's picked up by his best friend crime partner Tommy ""Five-Tone"" Messina (Danny Aiello). They are forced by mobsters, the CIA and couple Darwin (Richard E. Grant) and Minerva Mayflower (Sandra Bernhard) to steal the works of Leonardo da Vinci which are hiding crystals that combine to power a special machine. There is also Anna Baragli (Andie MacDowell) from a secret Vatican organization.This is a madcap caper. This is utterly ridiculous and some people may actually like it. This put me off a little. Bruce Willis does a bit of comedy at times but this movie needs a real comedian as his sidekick. God bless Aiello but he brings a different tone to the movie. I think everybody is expecting something closer to Die Hard but this is really a spoof of those movies. That's probably what put me off. It doesn't make me laugh but it certainly tries its darnedest.",Hudson Hawk
1,classicsoncall,"""I feel like a dolphin who's never tasted melted snow.""",5,10 November 2021,"For years I've heard about how bad this picture was. Well, I finally got around to watching it, and can confidently say that it's reputation is well earned. It could be because the film makers couldn't really decide what kind of movie they wanted to make, something between perhaps a clever heist film and an all out comic parody. Or maybe coming off the success of 'Moonlighting' and the first two 'Die Hard' films, Bruce Willis wanted to try his hand at something a bit out of the ordinary. In any case, either everyone got what they wanted here, or they failed miserably, but I guess you'll have to be the judge of that on your own. For me, there were too many gimmicks that didn't amount to anything, Like Hudson Hawk's (Willis) innate ability to rattle off how long popular songs were, or his being bundled up in a crate of styrofoam chips to be shipped off to Rome to pull off a cat burglar grand prize consisting of Da Vinci rarities from the Vatican Museum. If that weren't awful enough, enter Richard E. Grant and Sandra Bernhard as the Mayflower siblings, either working with or against the James Coburn character, George Kaplan. It was just too hard to tell with all the goofiness going on. With dismal dialog and disconcerting but not too hard on the ears duets offered by Hudson and his friend Tommy Five-Tone (Danny Aiello), this is one picture you'll either love or hate. Or maybe that's too strong. You might or might not like it.",Hudson Hawk
2,gavin6942,Catch This Hawk in Your Local Wal-Mart!,8,9 February 2006,"Bruce Willis has made some great movies in his day. This is one of them. And not only does it star Willis, but he wrote the darn thing, too. It's the story of Hudson Hawk, a reformed thief who is blackmailed by the mafia, the CIA, the Vatican and a large corporation into stealing Leonardo da Vinci artwork to be used for some secret purpose. You probably want to watch this before watching ""The Da Vinci Code"" because some parallels are likely to appear.The film is great as an action film, and also great as a comedy. Rarely does a film balance the two as well as this film does. The running jokes are great. What's Nintendo? How long is that Whitney Houston Super Bowl performance? Will Hudson Hawk ever get a decent cappuchino? These questions will be answered.My only complaint is that Andie MacDowell was supposed to Isabella Rosellini, who would have fit the part a bit better, I think. But Andie's dolphin monologue is brilliant just the same. Highly recommended!",Hudson Hawk
3,jboothmillard,Hudson Hawk,2,21 February 2011,"I knew the leading actor of this film, I knew it was rated one star out of five, and I hard that it was a really big box office flop, so I was interested to see why, from Razzie winning director Michael Lehmann (40 Days and 40 Nights). Basically Eddie Hawkins aka Hudson Hawk (Razzie nominated Bruce Willis) is a retired master cat burglar, and is being blackmailed into stealing separated pieces of a valuable artifact created by Leonardo DiVinci. The bad guys of the film are the husband and wife team the Darwins who run Mayflower Industries, Darwin (Razzie nominated Richard E. Grant) and Minerva Mayflower (Razzie nominated Sandra Bernhard), and there is also some mean activity by George Kaplan (James Coburn). Along the way Hudson gets some help from friend Tommy Five-Tone (Danny Aiello), whose life is threatened, and he keeps running into and slowly falls for museum architect Anna Baragli (Andie MacDowell) who may have more involvement than meet's the eye. That's really all I can be bothered to say about the plot. Also starring Donald Burton as Alfred, Don Harvey as Snickers, David Caruso as Kit Kat, Andrew Bryniarski as Butterfinger, Lorraine Toussaint as Almond Joy, Burtt Harris as Gates, Frank Stallone (Sylvester's brother) as Cesar Mario, Carmine Zozzora as Antony Mario, Coronation Street's John Savident as Auctioneer and Frank Welker as Bunny the Dog. It may have had one or two alright action sequences, but the story is boring, the attempted jokes, slapstick and dialogue based, are awful, the acting is just as bad, and it is too childish to take seriously or even watch, a stupid action comedy. It won the Razzie for Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay, and it was nominated for Worst Picture of the Decade. Pretty poor!",Hudson Hawk
4,Quinoa1984,"On the whole, this is a dumpster fire of a production",3,6 December 2015,"I've read some of the good reviews of Hudson Hawk, and if those folks (many here on IMDb) found enjoyment out of it, that's your prerogative. But you can call it a surrealistic/absurdist/satirical masterpiece all you want; the question has to come down for every single person watching Hudson Hawk: is this FUNNY? Perhaps in those large capital letters you may think so. I didn't find any of this BS funny. Hudson Hawk isn't surreal, and it wouldn't know surreal if it came and bit it in the dick with a toothbrush attached to a giraffe on fire. It's a movie made by clever people (no, really, they are, the guys made Heathers right before this, Michael Lehmann and Daniel Waters) that shreds genuine cleverness for self-satisfied smugness. This film is so satisfied with itself, but it never lets the audience see something just remotely close to reality so that the absurdity can find a foothold.I knew of this movie just by reputation - it was a bomb so notorious in its time it almost (just almost) made the previous year's Bonfire of the Vanities (also, coincidentally, with Bruce Willis) not seem so bad. It's a movie that cost upwards of 45 million dollars - at a time when that sort of thing wasn't done - and the movie is and isn't there at the same time. Sure, you have a super-star like Bruce Willis (and other names like Danny Aiello and Andie McDowell and, uh, Richard E Grant and Sandra Bernhard and James Coburn, people who may not have cost much but they're there I guess). Sure, you have locations in New York city and Rome, so there's a lot of action and fancy locations. And sure, there's... what else is there? I'm sure the actors were game for this, but the script is one of the biggest piles of dog crap I have ever encountered in all of my years of watching movies. Every other line has to be a joke, or some witty/smugly clever line. But it's not, it's stupid, it's lines that constantly, consistently, take the audience out of the movie (or it did for me). It's one thing to have a caper involving some sacred object from centuries past that multiple parties are after - right now I'm sure you can think of a number of movies right off the top of your head (Notorious and an Indiana Jones movie were ones for me). But here, it's completely artificial.It's not that artificial can always be a death knell; filmmakers for decades have used a sort of heightened, stylized form of dialog for characters to be kind of cool and interesting - watch the Ocean's 11 movies and you see it done with actual style and sincerity, since a) it's actually funny lines being delivered, and b) the filmmakers know to give a few minutes to let the characters be sort of real people. Here, from right after a prologue showing the DaVinci whatever thing, when Hudson Hawk is leaving prison onward, it's an onslaught of snappy dialog that doesn't snap, and things like, oh, musical numbers (?!) set as Willis and Aiello pull off a cat burglary/heist and it's so, so bad.This comes down to just being cartoonish; I almost wish it had been a cartoon, even an episode of f***ing Chip N Dale Rescue Rangers, whatever, and at least there could be some context for some of the things that happens with the supporting characters. Not even Andie McDowell, who appears at first to be possibly the straight person to react to all of these who-cares-about-a-top-lets-go-to-outer-space actors, can resist making dolphin noises when under some hypnosis/paralyzing drug from the bad guys. And any thought of Willis showing just some restraint is thrown out the window (apparently Willis got in clashes with the director and kept putting in his ideas, and incidentally has a 'co-story' credit, goodness).I'd tell you more about the story, but who cares, really? This is a movie where the writers and director think they've got a smash comedy on their hands - jokes about Nintendo and Cappuccino drinks abound, for example, and about stuff like the Vatican but it's so safe, even as it's an R-rated movie - but no arbiter of good taste seemed to be on the set while every actor made themselves into jerks. Sometimes for things to be funny, you have to play it STRAIGHT, to not make it like you're in on the joke, and that is the central problem with this movie.There's actually one almost decent sequence, where Willis has to steal a sacred notebook from a Roman museum, and here there is very little dialog (there's no show-tune, thank god), and how Hawk goes about stealing this item and getting away shows a few good ideas that the filmmakers had. But, on the whole, I just felt bad for a number of people here (Aiello especially, and Grant as well after seeing him be hysterical in Withnail & I). For Willis... this seems about right for his career at the time. I just didn't find it funny, and even then it would be a mess.",Hudson Hawk
5,edwagreen,Hudson Hawk *1/2,3,16 July 2013,"We would have been so much better off if the film had remained where it started-circa 1481 with Da Vinci trying out his flying machine.Instead, we're relegated to modern times with thief, Bruce Willis, is released from prison only to get involved with a bunch of the weirdest crooks imaginable in their attempt to steal Da Vinci items at various museums so as to achieve world domination.The picture becomes one of foolish comedy with a variety of slap-stick sketches, where Willis and co-star Andie McDowall along with Danny Aiello try to outwit the nonsensical thieves. We even have a Roman priest uttering Jewish expressions.The whole thing is just one big farce.",Hudson Hawk
6,BandSAboutMovies,"Well, umm...",5,15 July 2019,"Whatever Hudson Hawk is, it's not what it started out to be. It's totally different than the movie Joel Silver wanted to produce and it's completely different than the script Steven E. de Souza wrote. As Bruce Willis became a bigger and bigger star, he just took over, bringing on screenwriter Daniel Waters to add plenty of strangeness to De Souza's straightforward adventure tale.It didn't even have the same bad guys. Originally, Joss Ackland was going to be the Bond-style bad guy. Then, director Michael Lehmann actually had conversations with Audrey Hepburn before Willis said, ""Let's take the guy from the first draft and the girl from the second and make them a couple.""Hudson Hawk is really the story of how a small and fun film turned into a $50 million dollar loss for TriStar Pictures. In fact, this was the last movie produced by the company before they merged with the struggling Columbia Pictures. The film lost so much money, Sony had to salvage the companies by purchasing the remaining stock, then reorganizing the company as part of the recently-formed Sony Pictures Entertainment.Eddie ""Hudson Hawk"" Hawkins (Willis) just wants to celebrate his first day of parole with a cappuccino, but to get there, he has to deal with his parole officer, the Mario Brothers mafia family and the CIA, all of whom want him to do one more heist.Finally, he and his partner Tommy ""Five-Tone"" Messina (Danny Aiello) are forced to comply with Mayflower Industries, which is run by husband and wife Darwin (Richard E. Grant) and Minerva Mayflower (Sandra Bernhard), along with their blade-slinging butler, Alfred (Donald Burton). Their goal is to rebuild da Vincy's La Macchina dell'Oro, the alchemical machine that converts lead into gold.There are crystals in da Vinci's art that will power this machine, as well as a nun named Sister Anna Baragli (Andie MacDowell) who is an operative for the Vatican's secret intelligence. Also - our heroes use different songs to time out their robberies. Still with us?That said, It's hard for me to hate a movie that features James Coburn as George Kaplan, the name of the fake agent from North by Northwest, complete with handcuffs and a phone that emit the same tones as his famous Flint series of films. Or one that has David Caruso as an agent named Kit-Kat (all the CIA guys are named for candy bars).However, this is a film that proves that there really can be too much of a good thing. The end takes a long time to get there and when it does, you'll wonder why so much effort went into it.Hey man - it was the 1990's and these were the movies people wanted to see. This is the story of ego out of control. Yet the film that gave Willis so much power - he had tested really high with audiences in test screenings of Bonfire of the Vanities - crashed too.Between the throes of trying to release Meet the Applegates and the way he was treated by Willis on this film, it's a wonder Michael Lehmann ever directed again. But he stayed with it - he's been behind several American Horror Story episodes.",Hudson Hawk

8,poolandrews,An odd film that almost works but doesn't quite.,6,2 August 2007,"Hudson Hawk starts as the world's best cat burglar Eddie 'Hudson Hawk' Hawkins (Bruce Willis) is let out of jail after a long visit, he isn't even out of the place when his corrupt parole officer Gates (Burtt Harris) tries to get him to rob an auction house. Hawk isn't interested & just wants a coffee, however back at his friend Tommy's (Danny Aiello) bar the Mario brothers (Ha!) who run New Jersey's third largest crime family threaten to cut his balls off which is all the motivation Hawk needs (whimp). Hawk is told to steal a bronze horse made by Leonardo Da Vinci which he does, afterwards he is contacted by CIA agent George Kaplan (James Coburn) & a pair of billionaire megalomaniacs Darwin (Richard E. Grant) & Minerva Mayflower (Sandra Bernhard) who blackmail him into stealing a book by Da Vinci, which he does. But it doesn't stop there as Hawk finds himself in the middle of a plot to overthrow the world's economy! Wow.Directed by Michael Lehmann Hudson Hawk was absolutely mauled upon it's initial release by critics & was a major flop at the box-office, however having said that I didn't think it was all bad & there's a certain odd entertainment value here. The script by Daniel Waters & Steven E. de Souza is a slapstick comedy action adventure that doesn't quite work, it has some amusing moments & it has some mildly exciting ones but it doesn't quite gel. The goofy slapstick comedy moments overshadow the more serious action ones & it's hard to get excited especially when there are scenes like when Willis is sliding across as zip-wire & when shot he lands on top of a lamp post, perfectly balanced too. There are all sorts of odd double crosses & a bizarre collection of character's although the Mayflower's should have been in it much more as they were actually quite funny & sinister at the same time. Some of the jokes & gags work while other's don't, the little sketch at the start with Da Vinci & the Mona Lisa is amusing for instance while scenes like bad guy's with bombs stuck to their foreheads desperately trying to remove them aren't. The action scenes vary as well with Hawk being pulled along on a stretcher behind an ambulance & smoking a cigarette thrown from a nearby car coming across as very silly. It's really hard to review Hudson Hawk because I think it's one of those films you will either love or hate, although having said that I'm now going to totally contradict myself as I thought it was somewhere between the two being OK!Lehmann's career was more or less over after this tanked at the box-office, he's since gone on to make TV episodes of various show's & the odd film as well. The film looks nice enough thanks to a big budget, the action scenes are alright if a bit silly & it's got a bit of style about it. Back in 1992 Hudson Hawk won 3 Razzie awards for worst director (a bit harsh), worst picture (I'd have to see what it was up against) & worst screenplay (again I'd have to see what else was nominated) & was nominated for another 3 for worst actor, worst supporting actor & worst supporting actress while in 2000 it was nominated for another Razzie as the worst film of the decade which it clearly didn't deserve to win & didn't. That's a lot of hate amongst that lot, wouldn't you say?With a budget of about $65,000,000 this had a lot of money spent on it & it shows as it looks nice enough with that Hollywood look to it, the special effects are good & it's well made. The acting is very over-the-top especially by villains Richard E. Grant & Sandra Bernhard although they are fun & make for the best two character's in the film.Hudson Hawk is a difficult film to recommend as most people hate it although it does have some fans, personally I thought it was OK & is something a bit different even if it's not a total success.",Hudson Hawk
9,dbborroughs,You will either groove on its knowing brand of low comic silliness or you'll hate it,10,13 August 2005,"Just sprung from prison Hudson Hawk finds himself being chased by an insane and insanely rich couple, the CIA and the Vatican in a mad chase to get bits of a gold making machine made by Da Vinci. Along the way stupid jokes are told, the plot is ignored or twisted in the name of a joke and the entire cast winks at the audience repeatedly as if to say that even they can't believe the silly things they are doing in the name of fun.When this movie opened it was crucified by critics across the country as an unfunny vanity project. It sunk the promising career of the director and made people take a second look at Bruce Willis. very few people braved the reviews and saw this in theaters. Me? I'm one of the six people in America that went to see this on opening night. I've loved this movie from the first and my opinion has grown with each viewing. I remember arguing with people for weeks afterward that they should see this movie because it was damn funny. No one listened to me, and it wasn't until cable and home video that people discovered this wrongly dismissed gem. This is more proof that sometimes critics don't get it.Then again all humor is subjective and what one person finds funny is not what other people find funny. I love this knowingly dumb, puny, go for the obvious, nothing is sacred or too stupid to try collection of jokes and gags. Other people are offended or utterly bored by its often infantile antics. I find it charming and harmless, other people find it cruel (Bunny Ball Ball!). I can't say which camp you'll fall into, but I think that you should ignore the critics and just see this movie. Its mindless fun of the highest order.",Hudson Hawk
10,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Easily the worst comedy I've ever seen,1,7 February 2004,"When I sat down to watch this, I had reasonable expectations for it; I was sorely disappointed. I don't think my expectations mattered much though; no matter what I had expected, no matter how low my expectations were, I couldn't have been prepared for how horribly bad this was. It was complete and utter garbage, from the very beginning to the very end. I didn't laugh one single time. I don't know if this was a failed attempt at making a spoof of something or other, or just someones horrible idea at making a comedy. The acting is horrible, the characters are so cartoony that even a kid would feel embarrassed by how bad it is. The plot is so ludicrous that you can't possibly take it seriously; it's so stupid that no one could possibly like it, and is at the same time so complicated that it's hard to follow. I can't name one single aspect of this movie that is the least bit enjoyable, or could be, to anyone. No one should waste their time on this worthless piece of junk, this mocking of modern cinema. I wouldn't recommend it to anybody. Even most kids will think it's too stupid to like. 1/10",Hudson Hawk
11,HotToastyRag,"Cute and wacky, fun!",7,15 July 2019,"In this zany comedy, Bruce Willis stars as a cat burglar whose claim to fame is singing classic songs to time his heists. Sounds a little odd, doesn't it? Just be prepared that Hudson Hawk is a bit wacky, and you'll be in the right mindset to have a good time. I read the synopsis out loud when I rented it, and while everyone fled the room and refused to watch it with me-only a slight exaggeration-I ended up enjoying it!When Bruce Willis gets out of prison, his parole officer asks him to steal a statue from a museum. Bruce and his good friend and partner Danny Aiello sing ""Swingin' on a Star"" while they break into the museum's safe, and it's so adorable! As you settle into your seats and expect the rest of the movie to be a cutesy heist-musical, Bruce gets kidnapped and forced into another robbery. Two rival gangs, one led by James Coburn and the other by Richard E. Grant, keep tabs on Bruce as he stumbles through Rome trying to keep out of trouble. As if keeping out of trouble while getting into trouble isn't complicated enough, he also romances the beautiful, mysterious Andie MacDowell, who has her own secret agenda.The script of Hudson Hawk is very witty and quick; any movie that references David Niven as the perfect cat burglar will win me over in a wink. The pattern of the film keeps you constantly on your toes, shocking you with a bit of weirdness just when you think it's settled into a bit of consistency. Every line Richard E. Grant gets to deliver is hilarious, and his sparkling energy easily steals-and I mean that as a compliment-every scene he's in. He's delightful and charming, almost becoming a cartoon character in an equally wacky movie, and almost making you root for the bad guy.If you're in the mood for an oddball comedy, you'll probably get a kick out of this one. You get to hear Bruce Willis and Danny Aiello sing, see some Italian scenery, and appreciate the eye candy of Andie MacDowell. Also, keep an eye out for David Caruso, Frank Stallone, Lorraine Toussaint, and Sandra Bernhard, who gets to prance around in a different, gorgeous outfit in every scene.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. There's a scene where Bruce Willis is on a hospital gurney on the freeway, and the rocking camera movement will make you sick.In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""",Hudson Hawk
12,FlashCallahan,Hat conventions in July....,9,31 May 2012,"Hudson Hawk has just been released from ten years of prison and is planning to spend the rest of his life honestly.But then a crazy couple called the Mayflowers blackmail him to steal some of the works of Leonardo da Vinci, as they carry the secret to mass fortune.If he refuses, they threaten to kill his friend Tommy....First thing you need to know about this movie is if you don't like Bruce Wilis in smirk mode turned up to eleven, you will hate this.If you want one of the most daring, original summer blockbusters ever made, then this is for you.The reason that this is original, is because it was one of the big releases in 1991 behind T2 and Robin Hood, and it has one of the strangest narratives I have ever seen.And I fell in love with he film because I just went with it. Yes there is cheesy singing and people falling from one building and landing in another, but isn't this a Bruce Willis vanity product.apart from the fashion, Haircuts and earrings, the film has aged well, and even though the jokes are stale, you cannot help but to sit and watch it in all it's entirety.I've yet to meet anyone else who actually likes this film (or admit to it), but it's fun, over the top and just tongue in cheek all the way.",Hudson Hawk
13,Wuchakk,Sincere comedy caper sort of lost in translation,5,30 May 2018,"RELEASED IN 1991 and directed by Michael Lehmann, ""Hudson Hawk"" stars Bruce Willis as the titular expert cat burglar who has just been released from prison and intends on going straight, but he's blackmailed by the eccentric Mayflower couple (Richard E. Grant & Sandra Bernhard) into stealing works of Leonardo da Vinci for a gold-making machine that will destroy the world's economy. Danny Aiello plays Hawk's partner and Andie MacDowell his maybe babe. James Coburn is on hand as a top CIA agent.The film advertises right out of the gate that it's a goofy comedy, a parody of caper/spy flicks. The creators & cast bend over backwards to amuse the audience, but there are too few lulls to catch your breath. It's an almost constant barrage of over-the-top camp and comedy. I laughed several times, but too often I didn't. Still, it's a likable albeit curious throwaway comedy and should especially be worthwhile for fans of the cast. It cost an incredible $65 million (no doubt due to the costly globetrotting) and understandably flopped at the box office.THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 40 minutes and was shot in California, New York, New Jersey, Italy, Vatican City, Hungary and London.

14,Mr-Fusion,"Could've been so-bad-it's-good, but that's apparently asking too much.",4,21 July 2014,"HUDSON HAWK is one of those movies you just have to see to believe ... mostly to believe it ever actually happened. It's like a movie version of Bruce Willis' The Return of Bruno shtick, but without the actor's natural charisma. It's an unlikable performance, which is surprising, seeing as he wasn't yet the complete prick we all know today. The idea of Willis and Danny Aiello timing their cat burglar heist to the length of a song was kind of amusing, but the movie needed more of that jackassery. Instead, there's a lot of forced comedy, Sandra Bernhard (agh!) and long stretches of ridiculous story that you wish would go somewhere. This movie was already pretty silly while we were still stateside, but once we land in Rome, it all goes whacko. But it's not the good kind, and this thing was a real chore to sit through.4/10",Hudson Hawk

16,thesar-2,Wait. There's a Hat Convention in July?,1,12 April 2014,"Ever since my favorite summer movie season of all time, 1989, I looked more forward to the summer blockbusters than Christmas time. While I was slightly disappointed in 1990's summer slate, I thought it might be an off-year.Nope. NOPE. At the beginning of the 1991 Summer Blockbuster buffet, I went to go see the ""sure thing,"" a Bruce Willis Comedy/Adventure/Action. He could do no wrong, right?And the funny thing was, I was a ton less critical back then than I am now in regards to movies. I absolutely hated Hudson Hawk when I left the theatres during the credits. Again, back then, I was much more forgiving; I truly felt this was just a mess and it would get better. (Note: it really didn't, but had some notable films: Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Thelma & Louise, Soapdish, The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear and City Slickers.)This movie left such a bad taste in my mouth and even made me completely dislike Danny Aiello, even if he was in better projects. Thankfully, I moved past it and vowed to never see it again. And I would've kept that promise had it not appeared on the How Did This Get Made podcast which I vowed to watch/re-watch movies they hilariously review on their show.So, 23 years later, I finally give it a second chance. I sincerely don't recall hating it back then as much as I did this time. As a matter of fact, watching it this time, the thought: ""I fvcking hate this movie"" kept repeating in my head.To the movie's credit, I didn't hate on it until the bumbling and so-called best of the best burglars started singing. Yes, it wasn't perfect before that, but that one scene where both Danny and Bruce sang in sync was so awful, so distasteful, I never recovered from my hatred from that moment on.Recently freed from prison Bruce, à la Hudson Hawk, does the obligatory ""one final job"" but only to be double crossed and must face many opposing sides, such as the CIA, the Catholic CIA, Candy Criminals, a Nun with No Sense and two flamboyantly awful characters that made me turn my head away from the screen every time they showed up. Literally, they were like the traps set in the movie series: Saw. They were so gruesome and disgusting they either belonged in Saw or in Nothing But Trouble.When this movie pretends to be a comedy, it fails. When it states it's a heist movie, it's too damn easy. When it turns into slapstick, it's out of place. When it wants to be romantic, it's like dating your sibling.Nothing works here, nothing to take from it. Leave the hawk, or shoot it down before it makes it to your place.* * * Final thoughts: I see where they were going with most of this. Sadly, it's hard not to check out long before they prove what genre they want to represent. By the movie's end, it's so lost, even the actors seem to be throwing their arms up in defeat. Thank God this bombed so no sequel or talk of a remake.",Hudson Hawk
17,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,One of the worst films Willis has ever been in and an understandable box office flop...,2,6 July 2005,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits Freshly released from jail, cat burglar Eddie 'Hudson Hawk' (Bruce Willis) is approached by two crime brothers to pull off another caper. But this turns out to be just the beginning of a crazy plot involving an eccentric couple (Richard E Grant and Sandra Bernhard), his best friend (Danny Aiello) and a curator (Andie McDowell) with a, er, holier real profession...In 1988, Willis had appeared in Die Hard, the unforgettable action classic that pretty much re-defined the genre and pretty much cemented him as a bona fide Hollywood star. But then the 90s dawned. He attempted a more dynamic drama role with the disastrous Bonfire of the Vanities which was one major box office disaster, before returning to his action roots with this and scoring another big time flop. It had all the right ingredients, an all star cast (namely, headed by Willis himself) and no doubt plenty of publicity to back it up, but then the reviews came out and the film lost takings at a very fast rate. And the vast majority of the people who saw the film agreed with them.The film has a nonsensical and irritating plot that seems unsure what to do with itself throughout the film and is never exciting or amusing at any point. It's very self-indulgent in every respect, thinking the knowing action (the big bangs) and the knowing humour (Willis's smug cynicism) will pull it through. Willis is his usual smart-aleck self, but it's not enough to rest a film on. In the villains role, Grant and Bernhard are annoyingly hammy and over-the-top. Supporting players Aiello, McDowell and James Coburn are okay, but they are as lost in the mess of everything as everyone else...It wanted to make a big bang, but everyone agreed, this is a hawk you didn't want to catch. *",Hudson Hawk
18,cricketbat,I was expecting this to be a terrible movie and I was still disappointed.,2,6 August 2018,"I've often said that the worst movies in the world are comedies and Hudson Hawk helps to prove my point. Practically every time this movie tried to be funny, it failed and it was painful. I was expecting this to be a terrible movie and I was still disappointed. Bad acting, weird story, over-the-top goofiness - it just doesn't work.",Hudson Hawk
19,CuriosityKilledShawn,You could be better than you are,8,4 April 1999,"In May of 1991 the world was just not ready for Hudson Hawk, and apparently this caused a lot of confusion in the marketing department. How on Earth were they supposed to sell this strange oddity of a film? Eventually they settled on Bruce Willis brand recognition and built an ad campaign that would promote it as a sort of Die Hard-lite. When audiences eventually found out it was an absurdist, cartoon caper comedy they didn't quite know what to make of it and it was widely panned by critics and filmgoers alike. Not fair. Hudson Hawk is actually a wonderful little movie with a reputation is simply doesn't deserve.By the time July of 1991 rolled around the movie was getting its UK premier and the ad campaign had changed to play up the comedy and adventure more than the action. I remember 10-year-old me (already a Die Hard and Willis fan) sitting alone in a screen at the old UCI cinema in Kinnaird Park thinking ""this looks awesome"". If a kid could tell the difference...Being a 15-rating here in the UK (and rated R in the US) I had to wait until it hit home video. As soon as the end credits rolled I was fascinated by this new Cappuccino thing that Hawk was always harping on about. It became my go-to beverage whenever and wherever it was being served (an idiosyncrasy that has since been ruined by the horrific advent of ""fashionable coffee""). As you can tell, I've been a fan of Hudson Hawk since I was a kid.Bruce Willis is Eddie Hawkins, the world's greatest cat-burglar, who is determined to go straight after a long stretch in prison. Too bad for him that an assortment of eccentric villains are determined to force him to do their dirty work in a crazy world domination plot. Take the usual tropes of James Bond, Crosby and Hope, the Pink Panther, and retro heist movies and you'll have something close to what Hudson Hawk attempts to be. It is handsomely shot in real European locations with lots of quotable dialogue courtesy of Daniel Waters who co-wrote the script with Die Hard scribe Steven E. De Souza, based on Willis' original ideas. Yes, Bruce Willis created Hudson Hawk himself.The movie is far from perfect though, even the biggest Hudson Hawk fans know that. It is way too complicated and will take several viewings just to fully grasp what the hell is going on. However, even in 1991 it seemed that De Souza and Waters knew that the European Union and forthcoming ""single currency market"" would be a terrible idea. The plot to ruin the world economy would probably be lauded in these more politically turbulent times.Also,the literal bookends are an indulgence too far, and Andie McDowell (a last minute replacement for Isabella Rossellini and Maruschka Detmers) is just about tolerable in a role that she clearly didn't understand. The scene where she feigns mental illness by speaking in Dolphin-ish is yet another eccentricity that the film could have done without. But the main fault here is the swearing. The cast are dropping f-bombs and mofos all over the place and it just doesn't sit well the overall tone. There is absolutely no reason why Hudson Hawk should have been anything more than a PG. When I was 10-years-old I was overdosing on episodes of The Young Ones (a similarly anarchic and crazy TV show) and this movie really appealed to me. I do believe that kids and family audiences were the people that Hudson Hawk should have been sold to and the R-rating harmed the films appeal a lot.McDowell aside, the cast are all either wonderfully over-the-top or strangely quirky. From James Coburn's enthusiastic CIA crook, to a restrained David Caruso as the mute Kit Kat. He doesn't even have any lines and he has a character arc. If you are in need of light- hearted, good-natured entertainment then Hudson Hawk never fails. It is a real shame that this never had the chance to develop into a franchise. If so we might have been spared the awfulness of Die Hard 4 and 5.",Hudson Hawk

21,The-Sarkologist,"Great Movie, shame about the actors and the script",7,2 November 2012,"I have mixed opinions about this movie: the plot and even the character of Hudson Hawk are very good and draw me to the movie, yet the acting is quite appalling at times. Some of the lines were delivered very badly, and in fact some of the lines are simply quite bad. I wonder how it is that some of the actors actually were cast to play the roles in this movie when they are obviously quite bad. Personally I think the script still needed a lot of work, but disregarding that, this is still a very good movie and I very much enjoy it.Hudson Hawk (Bruce Willis) is a master catburgler who was set up by the CIA after breaking into a government installation. Hudson Hawk is a very fifties type of character that has been brought into the nineties. In fact he is getting old and loosing his touch as both burglaries that he performs do not go off perfectly. Yet it is interesting to note that he tells the time by the songs that they choose, such as Swinging on a Star.As soon as he is released he is approached by the third biggest crime family in New York, the Mario family (and I wonder why they are the Marios, especially how Nintendo is mentioned twice, maybe it is a play on words representing the Mario Brothers) commissions him to break into an auction house to steal a horse, but even though he does it, the horse still goes on auction. This leads Hudson Hawk into a plot to reassemble Leonardo Davinci's machine that turns lead into gold by two of the most wealthiest people in the world. It is a plot that twists and turns and involves everybody from the CIA to the pope.I won't go deep into the intricate twists and turns, crosses and double crosses that make up this movie. The two bad guys are the Mayflowers, Darwin and Minerva. The names are interesting, though I doubt they mean anything. Even so, the Catholic Church is involved so it is not surprising that their enemies are Darwin, after the evolutionist Charles Darwin, and Minerva, after the Roman Goddess. Minerva is a funny God because she is modelled on the Ancient Greek God Athena, who was a war god and patron goddess of Athens. Even so, both of them represent the anti-church forces, and represent the monetary forces which seek to push the church away. This is too intellectual for the movie though, yet some of the jokes are on a more intellectual, such as the what did I miss jokes. It is the characters that I appreciated, especially the big, dumb, CIA agent who reads Green Eggs and Ham out aloud.One of the themes though is for Hudson Hawk to get himself a proper Capachino. He tries throughout the entire movie but always seems to fail. Then there is the love interest, who turns out to be a nun, which does complicate matters a bit. Yet Hudson Hawk wants to give up his old life and start a new one, yet he cannot seem to do it. In fact, it turns out that the nun remains with him purely to make sure he stays on the right track. This, to me, is a metaphor describing humanity in general. Left by ourselves we will continue to sin, no matter how hard we try not to. We will always get caught up in things and continue to do things. It is only with God's help, as portrayed by the nun, that we can finally escape the endless cycle of sin and death. The people behind his sin were defeated by him, which is not the real case because Satan was only defeated by Christ as there was no way we could do it.This movie has a lot of potential, and it is ashame that it falls down in a lot of other places. I was told that the movie flopped, which is a shame because I do think there is a lot in the movie that makes it interesting.",Hudson Hawk

Plot In A Paragraph: Hudson Hawk, the worlds greatest cat burglar, has just been released from prison in New York. He is immediately blackmailed in to stealing some of Da Vinci's finest work in order to aid a world domination plot. Bruce Willis gives one of his worst performances as Eddie Hawkins/Hudson Hawk, likewise Danny Aiello is not up to his usual standard as Tommy Hawks best mate, Andie MacDowell is very blah as Anna, Hawks love interest. David Caruso and Frank Stallone are both fine in their supporting roles. However Sandra Bernhard and Richard E. Grant are simply awful. Cringeworthy bad. They ruin EVERY scene they are in. The movie doesn't seem to know what it wants to be, a slapstick comedy or an action adventure, and sadly ends up being neither. One thing I did like was a running joke in the movie that has Hudson and his partner Tommy (Aiello) singing songs concurrently but separately, to time and synchronize their exploits. Willis-Aiello duets of Bing Crosby's ""Swinging on a Star"" and Paul Anka's ""Side by Side"" are a bit of fun in an otherwise mixed bag.",Hudson Hawk

He plays a cat burglar, who's just got out of the can, and no sooner is he forced into stealing something from the Vatican, where some other baddies are after what he has. The music sequence of ""Would You Like To Wish On A Star"", sung by dangerous duo Willis and Aiello was admittedly and undoubtedly the best thing about this misfire of a movie, left in the hands of a trio of writers, one of them being Steven De Souza, where we would expect more from the guy.

There are several ridiculous scenes throughout the movie not the least is Willis and co-star Danny Aiello singing ""Swinging on a Star"" during a heist.There are villains galore in the story. The leaders of the gang are the Mayflowers, Darwin (Richard E. Grant) and his sister Minerva (Sandra Berhard) - both way over the top. A visibly aging James Coburn turns up as associate George Caplin the man who framed Hawk into a 10 year jail sentence.Also along are Donald Burton as the ""knife up the sleeve"" villain and Don Harvey, David Carouso, Andrew Bryniarski, and Lorraine Toussaini as the Candy Bar (or some such title) gang and if that were not enough we have Frank Stallone (brother of Sly) and Carmine Zozzora as the Mario brothers.The story has Hawk being released from prison after 10 years. He joins up with his partner Tommy Five-Tone (now there's a name for you). Hawk you see is a renowned burglar who is pursed by the bad guys to rob several institutions of works of art created by Leonardo da Vinci.It seems that Leonardo built a machine in the 15th century that will turn lead into gold. The machine is driven by a prism like device that is broken into several pieces and hidden within several works of art. It's still around apparently, in the 20th century.The various villains coerce Hawk into robbing several institutions including the Vatican of their treasures. And here's the best, Anna Baragli (Andie McDowell) is a NUN working under cover for the Vatican.Well there's several chases including Willis riding a guerney on the free way, explosions and many impossible stunts (well done mind you).

28,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Loopy classic,9,27 October 2015,"Hudson Hawk is the most fun I've had watching a Bruce Willis movie. It's also Bruce at his looniest, playing a slick heeled cat burglar swept up on a globetrotting adventure of epic weirdness and supreme tongue in cheek mayhem. It's what would happen if Mel Brooks, Indiana Jones, Bugs Bunny and James Bond got to drinking one night and decided to collaborate on a movie. People didn't appreciate its style at the time of release, and were no doubt confused by its abstract, off colour antics. To certain people who have a strange sense of humour (like myself), though, it's a treasure trove of priceless encounters, whack job characters and a ludicrously entertaining, larger than life plot line. Willis is Hudson Hawk, a cunning cat burglar who is blackmailed into stealing priceless Da Vinci works of art for evil billionaires Darwin and Minerva Mayflower (a coked up Richard E. Grant and butt ugly gargoyle Sandra Bernhard). They employ a quartet of demented goons named after chocolate bars, including a mute David Caruso as Kit Kat. Also pursuing him is smart ass ex military prick Kaplan (scene stealing James Coburn). He's aided by his wise cracking buddy Tommy Two Tone (Danny Aiello), and catches the romantic eye of beautiful Vatican nun Anna (Andie MacDowell) who's got a few tricks up her sleeve. The plot is an inane goose chase of setups, double crosses, lighthearted banter, and pure whacked out fun. Willis puts his million dollar smirk to great use, making Hawk a sarcastic, charismatic goofball and carries the movie quite well. It's the constant vibe of demented hysterics thrumming through the script, performances and lavish production design that make this one a winner, though. I promise you've never seen an adventure movie quite like it.",Hudson Hawk

31,Spleen,"No, I can't work out why everyone gives it a hard time, either",8,14 July 2000,"The idea of a cat burglar who times his heists by SINGING as he works (""Mack the Knife"" - four minutes, seven seconds; ""Swing on a Star"" - five minutes, thirty-two seconds - not that I believe either time is accurate) is a great one.  As he sings, the invisible orchestra and backing vocals pipe up, and the heists become production numbers ... or at least, the first one does. For a movie about a cat burglar there's remarkably little theft.  The Hawk only steals two things and he only sings during the first theft.  And singing is his schtick!  It's what prevents him from being just another boring old crim; why doesn't the film have the courage of his convictions, why doesn't he get to sing more than once?  Oh, there's a few bars of song buried somewhere in the laboured and confusing rescue sequence at the end, but no-one's heart is in it.  It IS a pity the way the film ends.  Things had been so deliciously off-beat until then, but the conclusion is so bog-standard the characters have mud on their feet.  And the final scene even collapses into self-reference: a sure sign that someone's imagination has failed.  (Can anyone fail to be disappointed, for instance, at the way ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" ends?)But all the same ""Hudson Hawk"" has so many good ideas, some of them well executed, I fail to see how anyone could hate it.  I like the fact that one of the shadowy organisations fighting for - well, something shadowy - is the Vatican.  (They give it a nice, and accurate, combination of menace and kitsch.)  I like Willis's performance.  I even like, or think that I like, the villainous plot: to flood the world market with alchemically produced gold, thus destroying the world's economy.

34,pyrocitor,Manic cool,6,7 February 2010,"Looking back at the wave of '90s action films and the hard worn standard of predictability they largely wore into the ground, it comes across as particularly refreshing to see a film which distinctly dared to take the initiative and try something different. And make no mistake - while the premise of Bruce Willis playing a veteran thief, recently out of prison and attempting to go straight yet roped into 'one last job' might seem as formulaic as any, the ensuing film, Hudson Hawk, is about as willfully atypical as a genre film might get, gleefully mangling one of the most typical genres of all. And of course, through attempting to pass itself off as a routine explosion-fraught romp, the film was riddled with disappointed expectations, scorn and outright dismissal. As such, examining Hudson Hawk for what it is, an unashamedly whimsical send-up of the expected 'Bruce Willis film' exposes a work permeated with unmistakable flaws, but also such a charming, barefaced uniqueness that one cannot help but take to it regardless, making it one of the most frenzied yet fun films of its time.Even the opening scene, an expositional flashback involving Leonardo DaVinci and the motivation behind his famous inventions, manages to set the film's exuberant yet surreal tone to a tee: a bizarrely stylized voice-over, cartoonishly over-the-top performances, and an overall sense of lunacy and chaotic madness which somehow remains captivating in the midst of the calamity. Then, abruptly, as the narrative leaps forward to present time and Hudson Hawk's release from jail, and, as the tone suddenly switches to smooth jazz, sanguine cinematography and Willis' impeccably suave character introduction, the viewer is given the sense of being momentarily entrenched in a different film. At the time, this transition feels like a reassuring return to reality after a curious introduction. On retrospect, the sudden tonal shift comes across as bait, a way of guiding viewers to again expect a typical heist thriller only to again derail any sense of normalcy.From that point on, the film continually flip-flops between icy cool and unhinged lunacy, often achieving both simultaneously, such as in the now infamous scene where Willis and Danny Aiello sing a duet to 'Swinging on a Star' in time with their first heist, complete with non-diegetic big band accompaniment. And while the frantic alternating of tone may often come across as awkward or downright befuddling, somehow director Michael Lehrmann manages to wrangle a serviceable product out of the mayhem, keeping the dynamic breezy and the pace lightning quick and speckled with spectacular throwaway gags, whether verbal (Willis' ""constipated warthog"" line remains the classic), physical (to see silly slapstick in the midst of a brutal fight scene is both incredibly surreal and deliriously enjoyable) or circumstantial. While the film is miles away from coherent, consistent or even sensibly advised, there is no doubt that it is never, never boring.Capping the film's outlandish sense of manic fun is its roster of 'have-to-see-it-to-believe-it' performances, pitched somewhere between 1960s B-movie hamminess and cartoonish, explosive hysteria. There is no question Bruce Willis makes the film worth watching, if only to see him not subvert but bizarrely amplify his trademark steely cool and caustic wit with bursts of downright silly overacting - to have Hawk screeching like a six year old with his pants on fire in one scene yet utterly convincing with a suave seduction in the next is a wonder in itself. Danny Aiello also delivers a welcomely lighthearted departure from his usual serious intensity, being charming and lovable while still retaining a necessary sense of threat, and showing delightfully offbeat chemistry with Willis. Andie McDowell also gleefully skewers the standard love interest/femme fatale figure with welcome inventiveness, a deft comic touch and charisma to spare. The film's antagonists come across as the most objectionable, with Richard E. Grant and Sandra Bernhard's petulant billionaires careening over the top to the point of downright gaudiness (particularly Bernhard), yet watching them screech, contort and grimace remains a strangely enjoyable, albeit uncomfortably alienating, experience.Thoroughly flawed, and liable to alienate most audiences unwilling to suspend disbelief to the point of tolerating its indulgent lunacy, Hudson Hawk nonetheless remains a daring experiment and welcomely satirical deviation from the standard action/heist film. Nonetheless, audiences willing to accept the film's grotesquely strange elements as pointedly self-effacing (and even, on retrospect and given a considerable benefit of the doubt, strangely clever) and to subscribe to the cheerful insanity of it are likely to emerge humming the typically strange yet fun closing credits 'Hudson Hawk funk theme song', having undergone one of the most bravely different, downright dopey and oddly enjoyable films of the age and survived to tell the tale.-6.5/10",Hudson Hawk

Sure it was never going to be an Oscar favourite or a critical darling given that much of the humour was quite abstract and that there were so many pratfalls, but c'mon it's reasonably funny and likable if you don't hate Bruce Willis in smirk-mode Which he is from first frame to last as Hudson Hawk, the very last image you see is a freeze-frame of Willis tossing away a coffee cup with a half grin. But the 90 minutes preceding that had some good moments.Hudson Hawk is a cat burglar of the highest calibre, who in true A Team style was framed for a crime and spent a great deal of time in prison. Upon release he decides in classic style to go straight along with his buddy Tommy (Danny Aiello) and run a bar/coffee shop in Joisey.But, the duo are blackmailed not once, not twice, but thrice, each time the target is priceless artworks created by one Leonardo Da Vinci, and along the way Hawk and Tommy must ward off the unwelcome assistance or competition from the police, the mob, the shonky CIA, billionaire criminal nutjobs and the Vatican.I can totally see how someone can see this film as mediocre, even below average and that's fine everyone can have an opinion – as long as it's mine.About half an hour in Darwin and Minerva Mayflower enter the frame as eccentric billionaires who are behind everything. Richard E. Grant and Sandra Bernhard ham it up so much that you either have to laugh or turn off the film, I keep watching ... They also are responsible for most of the subsequent laughs in the film. Richard E. Grant wrote a book about his career and had an entire section devoted to what a calamity making this film apparently was. (I have since bought the book.) Sandra Bernhard has always been ugly, but here she is distractingly, hideously ugly. The fact that she doesn't seem a mite self conscious is amazing to me. If you don't pay attention you'll miss three of the better jokes in the film, all revolve around the Mayflower's dog Bunny.Sure the second half is too rushed and packed with 'huh?' moments, but if you can check your brain at the door there are laughs to be found, and if you can call a million other Sandler and Aniston films dumb fun then why not this one? In summation: Hudson Hawk aimed too high, it lacked focus and in the end – like a fat man having a heart attack it just had too much cheese and ham(ming). The songs were also the weakest point, but the same can be said for Mariah Carey albums – and she's rich.What Hawk has on the PLUS side are some terrific quotables, great bit-characters that went for broke and ended up redeeming the film, and some good jokes.I understand that you might say you either get it or you don't, but all-time turkey?

So he and his partner Tommy do the job (and perform a catchy tune as they work), which sets off events that lead to an adventure they had no intention of trying to find (going to Italy, stealing from the Vatican, dodging a lot of bullets, etc).They don't make em like this anymore.

38,classicalsteve,"Good Talent and Premise Wasted on Poor Screenplay -- Instead of a 1990's ""Hot Rock"" we get Warner Bros Cartoons",5,28 June 2014,"It isn't enough to come up with a good premise in terms of a storyline for a film script. The script has to realize its potential. Unfortunately the talents of Bruce Willis and Danny Aiello weren't enough to save this disjointed and largely un-entertaining excuse for a movie. What makes ""Hudson Hawk"" so frustrating is that the initial premise is actually a good one which had a lot of potential. While I understand the filmmakers probably wanted to make a movie which was a kind of comedy-caper, much like similar films of the 1960's, they made so many over-the-top efforts to ""to be funny"" that ""Hawk"" is nearly unwatchable in some scenes.Usually heist films and other similar fair where the baddies are essentially the main characters have a lot of comedy which can evolve out of the situations rather than being forced. ""The Hot Rock"" and ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" are cases in point. I wish the screenwriters of ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" and/or ""The Hot Rock"" had been the ones to write this screenplay, or at least they should have offered advice to the writers of ""Hawk"". In ""Butch and Sundance"", some of the funniest moments are when the two outlaws are arguing with each other about what to do next and how to handle the situation. Never do we feel like the jokes are forced upon the characters. That's what I felt with ""Hawk"", that the humor was forced by the hand of the screenwriters rather than coming from the characters' mouths naturally.The premise is simple but could have been affective if handled better. A cat burglar is let out of prison and takes on some ""jobs"" to lift some of Leonardo da Vinci's artwork. Unfortunately, as a kind of introduction, we meet da Vinci and his world and it looks like a bad scene from Mel Brooks' ""History of the World Part 5"". From here on out we know the film is not only going to be over-the-top in the humour department, but it's never going to take itself seriously enough for there to be any real meat to the story. It's over the top humour for humour's sake, and I felt I really didn't care about anything the characters were doing, unlike ""Butch and Sundance"" where at every moment I was riveted by their actions.Even films like the first Superman film with Christopher Reeve had a lot of humour but ultimately took itself seriously enough that we cared what happened to its characters. Hawk could have been a really good film if the writing had been better, the characters less cardboard, and the humour less cheap. Instead, the filmmakers made a film not unlike many of the Warner Bros. cartoons of the 1940's and 50's. The action is over the top, the acting is over the top, and the lines were just downright ridiculous at times. And yet at other times, the plot seemed a bit more serious, as if the film didn't quite know what it wanted to be. Great potential wasted.",Hudson Hawk
39,gbheron,"They Couldn't Be Serious, Could They?",8,30 March 2002,"*****Minor Spoilers*************Hudson Hawk, a master thief played by Bruce Willis, is released from prison in the first scene. He's a real wiseguy (as in smart-ass), very New York, an urban good old boy. Not left alone to start an honest life, he's immediately set upon by bad guys who coerce him and his sidekick (Aiello) to return to a life of crime. Hawk's job is to acquire the components of an alchemist's machine, discovered centuries ago by Leonardo da Vinci, that can render lead into gold. Da Vinci hid the components in three priceless works of art, so there will be a series of high-tech thefts. Out to stop him is Andie McDowell, an intelligence agent for the Vatican.Is this movie any good? Well it depends on what kind of movie you think it is. If you believe that Willis and company are serious, intending to make a Cary Grant type crime caper you'll find the movie virtually unbearable, a disaster. If you believe the intent is to make an over-the-top spoof of the genre, it's a tour-de-force. I side with the latter company and found ""Hudson Hawk"" an enjoyable lark.",Hudson Hawk
40,Bob-45,More Than Just `Dudson Dork',5,10 September 2001,"Those in the film community who dismissed `Hudson Hawk' as `Dudson Dork,' failed to appreciate many of the better features of the film. If one could imagine the results of throwing elements of `Die Hard,' `Our Man Flint,' `The President's Analyst,' `Masquerade, (1965)' the Marx Brothers and Dr. Seuss all into a mixmaster, one might be able to approximate `Hudson Hawk.' Too sadistic and violent to be satisfying as a comedy, `Hudson Hawk' is too silly to be taken seriously as an action film.  Nevertheless, how could anyone not enjoy David Caruso's hilarious `Kit Kat,' Lorraine Toussaint's smarmy `Almond Joy,' James Coburn's sardonic sendup of a rogue `Derek Flint,' the incisive interjection of the Catholic Church into the melee or the witty repartee between Bruce Willis and Danny Aiello?  Willis must have been smoking some pretty good stuff to come up with this amiable mess. However, he must have been saving the best stuff for the producers he convinced to finance it.Better if taken in small doses, ""Hudson Hawk"" is certainly not a complete waste of two hours.",Hudson Hawk
41,carbuff,"Not for everyone, but I liked it.",7,3 September 2018,"I watched ""Hudson Hawk"" with my 80+ year old parents. To put it bluntly, they hated it. They just didn't get any of the cultural references or the fact that it was a parody of James Bond-type and similar action movies. By no means is this a great film, but it's got quite a lot of funny lines and scenes, with a bit of somewhat harsh violence thrown in sporadically. For instance, it's best to be able to reference James Coburn from his ""In Like Flint"" movies, along with his more serious roles in this same vein, to appreciate what is going on with his character. Same with the supervillains, who are just grossly exaggerated characters out of something like an 007 flick. This movie isn't meant to be deep, but it is a decently humorous romp if you get where it's coming from. One of the easiest ways to tell if you might like this film is whether or not you cared for the ""Austin Powers"" series, even though those are even much less serious. If ""Austin Powers"" falls flat for you, ""Hudson Hawk"" will probably likewise disappoint. Do go in with the understanding that this really is nothing more than a popcorn flick, not a serious ""work of art"".

44,Bolesroor,Sometimes Bad Is Bad,1,9 July 2005,"Let me begin by saying I love Bruce Willis. He proved in Moonlighting that he has a knack for comedy and in Die Hard that he belongs on the big screen, as great an action star as Hollywood has ever had. I also love comedies of all kinds- spoofs, black comedies, trash, generally everything on the Cult shelf at your now-extinct video store.When Hudson Hawk came out I was just a lad laughing at the negative hype, the hatred that was directed toward the film. How bad could it be? I rented the video and learned just how bad. Bruce Willis, despite what I detect was some genuine emotional investment, creates a high-flying, sensory-numbing ego trip in which he tries to be the action hero, the comic relief, the romantic lead, the song and dance man, and the narrator all at the same time. What worked in the movie? Simply put: ""Swingin' On A Star,"" the sequence in which Willis as cat burglar Hawk times a precision robbery with his partner not by synchronizing watches but by singing the standard while skateboarding past security guards. Had the movie remained this gentle, this clever, this much of a kick, we might have had something. Sadly, this is all that works in the entire movie.What doesn't work? Where to begin: the entire supporting cast, with the stone-faced Andie MacDowell proving yet again why she's the worst actress to ever appear on the big screen. I don't know what's worse- the fact that she cannot express any emotion or the fact that every time she tries to she looks hideous, bucktoothed and backwards and paper-bag ugly. Speaking of ugly we're also treated to uber-nothing Sandra Bernhard as one of the villains, and you only have to watch her for ten seconds before it's plain she has no talent whatsoever. Last time I saw her was Nick @ Nite hosting the ""America's Funniest Mom"" Competition. That seems about right. Richard E. Grant as her villain partner is equally loathsome, and you'll come out of the movie literally hating the both of them. Gangsters and goons appear and disappear with no logical progression, David Caruso appears as a mute who holds up a card that reads: ""My name is Kit-Kat. This is not a dream,"" and Bruce Willis breaks the fourth wall by smirking directly to the audience and delivering wry one-liners about the quality of the film. We didn't need him to tell us it sucks.So anyway I watched the movie just recently, fifteen years later, with an open mind and no hype to distract me... it's still terrible. The fact that so many people here are saying good things about the movie honestly frightens me... I think they find it outrageous to proclaim one of the world's worst movies was really ""not that bad."" I don't know about you but I look for more than ""not that bad"" out of my viewing experiences. The movie was such a failure many predicted it would kill Willis' career, and while the critics were nasty about him and the movie they were not wrong. Hudson Hawk literally wiped the smirk off of Willis' face for a long while and brought one of Hollywood's biggest stars down to Earth for a much-needed reality check.I can't stop you from seeing this movie. You'll probably have to learn for yourself... but don't say I didn't warn you.GRADE: D-",Hudson Hawk

We had already seen Airplane! and Naked Gun, so Hudson Hawk was somehow doomed to fail.Willis was of course riding high after his success with the first two ""Die Hard"" blockbusters, so Joel Silver must have given him total creative control because he must have been absolutely positive that Willis could not fail entirely. You can even see it in the credits where the name Willis is all over the screen. He even gets to sing but not that great, Aiello does better.So, despite the slamming the film got from both critics and audiences this is absolutely worth seeing because of the almost insane energy that drives the whole show. Willis is determined to bang you over the head with every possible joke and it is not kiddy jokes that are most frequent here. The writing is excessively incoherent and some of the scenes look like they were spliced together at random. Maybe this movie was not supposed to be high art but some of the jokes fall flat on their face, especially regarding David Caruso's non-speaking part as Kit-Kat.Andie McDowell does a fairly good job at keeping a straight face through all this but remember, this is definitely not a chick-flick and it is quite possible she would rather forget the whole experience. Then there are Richard E. Grant and Sandra Bernhard and the less said the better. Grant does say his lines without losing all dignity but Bernhard is as shrill as chewing on ice cubes.There are many more points that goes both for and against this movie but the thing that puts it a little over the top is the shear guts it took to release it in the first place. Willis is of course still on top and I think that he quickly got over the bomb when Pulp Fiction came out 3 years later.",Hudson Hawk

If the movie's creators don't take the material seriously -- why should we?""North by Northwest"" is hardly a serious film. The climactic scene on Mount Rushmore is //intended// to be ridiculous, a parody of Hitchcock thrillers. ** It gets away with this silliness by doing a slow build in which the normalcy and predictability of everyday life are gradually stripped away. What ought to be absurd is accepted as realistic.You can't have a film that's ridiculous/absurd from the beginning -- unless it's an obvious farce (""Airplane!"") or a Warners cartoon. ""Hudson Hawk"" is neither.There are moments of real humor, especially one involving a ketchup bottle. But these are too few and far between to even begin to save the film.

This comes from believing the critics and the (long dead) negative hype for this movie-- even after seeing most of it, and liking it, I still never bothered to rent the thing or watch it from start to finish. Finally, recently, I got lucky with my cable and saw the opening credits for the first time.""Hudson Hawk"" takes a lloooongggggg long time to get going. The first 10 minutes are slow, boring, not very funny, and don't have any jokes. It's all set-up. Set-up that, today, 14 years later, is at the top of the best-seller list with ""The Da Vinci Code."" Go figure.In the entire opening (14th century) scene, about eight minutes along, there are only two jokes. Once we meet Bruce Willis's present-day Hudson Hawk, he jumps into his repertoire with buddy Danny Aiello so quickly, it's a jarring change in pace that takes the viewer several minutes to adjust. If you're a film critic, and you saw this movie before its release in 1991, of course you're not even paying attention at this point, maybe no longer in the theater. It gets better.Once the slapstick/farce aspect picks up speed (and it really does take too long), the film just whistles along like a goofy train ride. The filmmakers aren't smart enough to cut the jokes that don't work (""The dolphins are speaking to me!""), so 1 in 5 fall flat. But everything else makes this wacky caper comedy really about a 7 out of 10, and not the 5.1 it currently rates. What's not to like about a singing thief? At least it's original. Richard E. Grant and Sandra Bernard make super-annoying megalomaniacs, James Coburn gives the other bad guys the necessary gravitas, and an evil butler has not a single funny line, but a great weapon of choice.I've always been on the fence about Andie McDowell, and this movie doesn't tip the scales either way. She's there, she's female, Hawk has a crush on her. Whatever. It's the snappy patter that was amusing, and makes this one for Aiello or Willis fans only. Er, mostly.",Hudson Hawk

But on the day he's released from prison, Eddie (Bruce Willis) is blackmailed and forced to once again use his skills. This time, Eddie is required to steal some of Da Vinci's artworks and inventions, all of which will lead to world domination and the bad guys being loaded with gold. Eddie accepts and from here on in the film is nothing but pure random odd comedy.Considering the lead star is Bruce Willis, I can't bring myself to say this is a normal action film, especially for him. Hudson Hawk is simply a nutty, random comedy (and I really mean Nutty). It should be known that this is the only film where actor Bruce Willis managed to have input in the film's writing and script and got credited for it.Throughout the film Bruce Willis is confident about himself and I love that. His random jokes and one liners are so bad... that they're actually funny. It amazes me that certain things were actually written for this blockbuster film. It's darn near impossible to take anything in this film seriously and so many things are also unrealistic. For example, Eddie sits at bar to drink a Cappuccino but someone shoots his cup while in his hand. Eddie is totally calm about it and just raises an eye brow. Oh, and everyone around him doesn't even notice that shots were fired.The film's villains also have jokes similar to Eddie's and naturally they also go way over the top like comedic Bond villains, consistently using unnecessary violence and evil laughter.The film's editing is also questionable. The resulting film is choppy but I don't know if this was purposeful or due to lots ending up on the cutting room floor. One gag (if I can call it that) involves Eddie jumping off the roof of a vehicle and landing perfectly in a chair at the table and restaurant where he was to meet his date. What the!?Overall, I can't really recommend Hudson Hawke to anyone, but actually... I changed my mind, I will. But not because this film is amazing, but because it's not. Because sometime you need to see a film that's so bad, it's funny.

53,ReelCheese,What The...,6,6 June 2006,"I'm torn on HUDSON HAWK. After watching it, part of me went, ""What the hell was that?"" But another part suggested that maybe I wasn't hip enough to ""get"" what it was trying to do. Part of me thought it was a completely ridiculous waste of time. Part of me thought it was just good, clean fun.Though certainly not for everybody, there are enough redeeming qualities in HUDSON HAWK to avert its dismissal as a multimillion-dollar turkey. Bruce Willis is Eddie ""Hudson Hawk"" Hawkins, a cat burglar intent on retiring but who is forced to steal Da Vinci works of art for a (gasp!) world domination plot. Along for the ride are Tommy Five-Tone (Danny Aiello), mysterious nun Anna Baragli (Andie MacDowell) and conniving bad guy George Kaplan (recognize that name?) played by the late James Coburn.The plot sounds like it could have made for a good DIE HARD-style caper, but director Michael Lehmann had other ideas. As he reveals in the DVD version's audio commentary, HUDSON HAWK was meant first and foremost as a comedy. Trouble is, it was promoted more as a Bruce Willis action blockbuster. Audiences were left scratching their heads as their favorite tough guy engaged in Stooge-like slapstick, sipped cappuccino and, most astoundingly, crooning Crosby classics.Not that mistaken expectations are the only thing wrong here. Indeed HUDSON HAWK is simply too silly for its own good. The gags frequently fall flat, nearly embarrassing the talented performers involved. The plot is overly convoluted, and Richard E. Grant and Sandra Bernhard as the villainous Mayflowers are a bit hard to take.

It defies logic and categorization. It's an action comedy, but it's an adventure movie too.

It's all over the place, and will turn some, no, many off. It would've been nice to see Willis and his sidekick be zany characters in a serious movie, but it's still entertaining to see the whole thing be a live action cartoon.There is action. Some fight scenes, a cool ambulance chase with a great stunt in which Willis rides a gurney on the freeway, a long scene outside a mansion with Willis engaging in the most cartoonish fight scene ever, and a long final battle that's well-done. There are some brief moments of R-rated violence that clash with the tone, which were weird. The movie should've been PG and had light action and no cussing, for the kind of film it is. Maybe then it would've done better.If I haven't convinced you of the movie's brilliance in its stupidity, than let me put it this way. It's an action movie...with musical numbers.

The movie portrays a nostalgic burglar identified as Hudson Hawk(Bruce Willis), who's too good at stealing that not a single bad guy on this earth would let him go without a mission. So, Hawk, reluctantly accepted this final work to steal 3 of the Da Vinci's artifacts which contain the pieces of a magical crystal that can transform metal into gold....The first half of the movie has the comedy in its light side, action and story on heavy side, which gives audiences a lot of expectations in this way. However the second half of the movie went out of control. It just went out too far on the ""no-brain"" comedy genre. Even the fat partner presumably blown up had returned alive. Ridiculous?

The visual effects created by ILM are fabulous and it would be interesting to know that wire removal is used here for the first time.There are some additional problems mainly with the make up in some scenes, especially in the auction house and also with the overall lighting, which is somewhat bad.I believe that a little editing would transform this movie into an instant classic, without changing the general feel. Some of the scenes make this action comedy into a self parody, which makes it a bit annoying, especially towards the end.It was a daring task to make 'Hudson Hawk' and while it is not perfect, it still is a very entertaining movie.",Hudson Hawk

62,pswanson00,Pleasant surprise,7,5 January 2007,"The reviews I read caused me to avoid Hudson Hawk when it was first released in theaters, but I happened to catch it on TV one afternoon and enjoyed it thoroughly. What the critics seemed to miss is that this is a satire, not a tooth-grinding, edge-of-your-seat action flick. It's SUPPOSED to be funny, people! The cast of this film is terrific, and no one moreso than Danny Aiello. Having seen him play everything from Cher's schmuck of a fiancé in Moonstruck to very vicious bad guys, his performance here as a burglar who sings to time his escapes is sheer over-the-top hilarity. Bruce Willis again showed me that he doesn't take himself too seriously, and Richard Grant and Sandra Bernhard are perfect as the cartoon-like villains. To get full enjoyment from this film, think of it as a member of the same family as ""Boris and Natasha,"" not ""Die Hard."" You'll have a lot more fun.",Hudson Hawk
63,guyfromjerzee,Should become a cult classic,8,22 January 2005,"Whenever you combine genres, you're always treading dangerous waters. In this case, the general public didn't seem to like the combination of action and comedy. But for anyone who hasn't yet seen this movie, keep this in mind: You're not supposed to take it seriously! Director Michael Lehmann's whole agenda was to poke fun at the goofy conventions of action cinema. Since I like Bruce Willis and for some reason possess an odd curiosity about movies that were universally panned by critics and audiences alike, I gave this movie a try. And boy, am I glad I did. I was amused from start to finish! Accuse this flick of being ridiculous, accuse it of being ludicrous, but you cannot accuse it of being unoriginal. One thing's for sure: it's a hell of a lot better than those stupid ""Charlie's Angels"" movies. Don't ask me why people don't mind taking trash like that with a grain of salt, but feel the need to bash the hell out of a movie like ""Hudson Hawk."" I mean, how can you possibly hate a film where there's a chase between an ambulance and a gurney on the Brooklyn Bridge? And to top off the gag, Bruce Willis, who's stuck on the gurney, still has to pay the toll! I'm no fanatic when it comes to musicals, but watching two masculine actors like Willis and Danny Aiello perform a duet of ""Swing on a Star"" while doing a heist is quite priceless. The script is filled with hilarious one-liners, most of them perfectly delivered by Willis, who has a gift for wisecracking humor. People tend to forget that he's a talented comic actor (remember ""Moonlighting""?) as well as being a successful action star. ""HH"" gives him an opportunity to combine those talents. Aside from the verbal humor, there's also plenty of great slapstick. Once again, how can people possibly hate this movie? It has everything! It really sucks when a filmmaker tries to do something creative and different, and ends up getting shot down. Ignore the barrage of negative reviews and poor box office records, and see this movie!",Hudson Hawk
64,Zoooma,Let this be the last Bruce Willis movie you ever see,3,2 October 2014,"My second time seeing this and first time since it was in the theaters... so it's been awhile and there's barely anything at all that I remembered. I knew it had a reputation for being spectacularly bad and that's exactly what it is. Well, I've seen much, much worse but it's still pretty stupid. I do like Bruce Willis so I wanted to give this a completely fair shake. He actually does a great job with the material he's given but the script is just ridiculous. It looked quite promising for the first five or ten minutes but it goes downhill fast and stays there. Moronic characters appear and the plot takes strange twists. Lame. Just lame. Anyone watching the Bruce Willis catalog should either save this for last in case you die first and never have to see it or watch it first to get the worst out of the way.5.2 / 10 stars--Zoooma, a Kat Pirate Screener",Hudson Hawk
65,bernie-122,"If you don't mind your intelligence being insulted, then go ahead and watch.",1,30 April 2008,"I will admit, I had some expectations going into this; somehow, I never managed to hear about its reputation. It had some stars I really like, such as Andie MacDowal, Danny Aiello, even James Coburn. Well, even Bruce; yes, I liked him in the Die-Hards, at least. He wasn't bad in Pulp Fiction, but most of his other stuff I could well do without.I certainly wasn't expecting one of the worst films I've ever seen. That's what I got. There were some funny bits, for sure, like the Mona Lisa part, and... Umm... Oh, there must have been more, surely. Maybe not.As to those here who declare that this turd is headed for cultdom, I say that they have no idea what makes a cult classic. This movie will only go down in history as the biggest failure of all time. It actually didn't need to go that much further to land in the Ed Wood camp, except that Ed didn't know that he was making camp classics.Another thing that prompted me to write this is that I noticed that all the really bad reviews for this film are stuck in the last pages. I have to assume that the editors can and do order the reviews how they see fit, and so they can, as in this case, make a bad film appear not so bad by putting all the good reviews first, as not many are going to read through them all as I did.One other thing; there are lots of people who post reviews here which are quoting so many stars out of 5. These are obviously intended for elsewhere. Since it is well known that IMDb uses a 10-star rating, is it too much trouble for you to adjust your second-hand review to suit? Obviously so.So, one out of ten it is. If you must watch it, leave your brain at the door.",Hudson Hawk
66,Animus,It's a *Comedy* people.,9,26 April 1999,"Sooooooo many people told me this movie was bad, they said the plot makes no sense, they said too many jokes, they said it was unrealistic, and that there was not enough action. That's the *point*! Admittedly this movie came out at a time when Willis was better known for Action/Adventure flicks, and the cover does seem to indicate an action movie, but please, if you can't figure out it is a comedy in the first 10 minutes, please leave the theater. Funny, funny stuff.",Hudson Hawk
67,Newsense,Hudson Hock,1,10 November 2008,"Who told Bruce Willis he could do comedy? Better question: Who told Bruce Willis that he can write comedy? Bruce is funnier in movies he doesn't write. Hudson Hawk is not only a vanity project, its the worst vanity project ever made(at least Harlem Nights had its moments).Story: Bruce Willis plays Eddie Hawkins also known as Hudson Hawk, a well-known cat burglar. He does his last job with his partner Tommy Five-Tone(Danny Aiello) and decides to call it quits until he is forcefully shoved back into stealing by a nefarious crook called George Kaplan(James Coburn) who is in cahoots with two theatrical idiotic masterminds known as Darwin(Richard E. Grant) and Minerva(Sandra Bernhard). In Europe, Hudson Hawk is befriended by a spy posing as a nun known as Anna(Andie MacDowell).Opinion: None of the jokes work and most of the time Bruce Willis is smirking in front of the camera like a spazz. The humor consists of poorly executed slapstick and cheesy one-liners like Bruce telling a decapitated butler that he wont be going to a hat convention. Doesn't that just tickle your funny bone? Eh, no. Danny Aiello's performance was slightly better here than it was in Harlem Nights but it was still weak. Andie MacDowell is as bland as usual as Anna and have you ever seen a more excruciating performance than Sandra Bernhard's Minerva Mayflower? Sheesh, how insufferable can one woman get? That insufferable. Bruce Willis has no comedic timing and Hudson Hawk is such a bumbling airhead that you want George Kaplan and his stupid goons(which are all named after candy bars)to put him out of his misery. I mean, who the hell just stands there and gets shot with a dart? Was that supposed to be funny? No, its just painful and the same goes for Hudson Hawk, the worst vanity project of all time. Now for the age old argument that you have to be deep to understand those jokes. My reply: that's a load of bull because anybody whose seen Monty Python and The Three Stooges can see those jokes coming two miles away. Stop writing these positive reviews for this movie, Bruce! I know thats you trying to recoup your losses. Charge it as a loss and give it up already.",Hudson Hawk

I like Bruce Willis, but he couldn't save this. Sometimes it seemed like even he couldn't believe how dumb this movie was. It has the IQ of a Saturday morning cartoon. You'd think the screenplay was written by children.
Sure, I laughed a couple of times, but it didn't make up for how bad the rest was. The plot is too complicated but stupid at the same time. They get out of situations out of sheer dumb luck.
It had a promising start, but just got stupider and stupider as the movie went on. You know how in movies cars go over a cliff and explode for no reason on the way down? Well, that basically explains this whole film (and yes, this happens in the movie).

I noticed nuances I'd missed, and just thoroughly enjoyed the subtle and the slapstick.George Kaplan! Ball bunny, ball.It was an ego trip by Willis, but there are by far, more egregious, more offensive examples.I'll bet the actors thoroughly enjoyed making the film and it shows.

72,kira02bit,A complete mess,2,10 February 2016,"Comic action film centering on crackerjack cat burglar Bruce Willis, fresh from prison, who is blackmailed into stealing priceless works of art by a psychotic wealthy couple (Richard A. Grant and Sandra Bernhard) lest they murder his best friend Danny Aeillo.Hudson Hawk is notorious in the annals of legendary horrible film-making as a total debacle. Still, such films can be fun in retrospect. Not so much for this one. Willis is the driving creative force behind the film (and I use creative cautiously), having been a producer, writer and lead actor. One wonders why he stopped himself from stepping into the director's chair, but I guess even Willis has his limits, so he graciously allows director Michael Lehman to fall on the sword in that capacity. One would think since Willis wrote the mess of a screenplay that it would at least play to his strengths. If so, then one can only presume that constant smirking and smug arrogance are Willis' only cards to play. Truthfully, if an actress had perpetrated this worthless spectacle, her career would have been over before the print on the first reviews was dry. As evidence of the Hollywood double standard, Willis was allowed to carry on despite disastrous box office with nary a blip.The film's biggest clever flourish is having Willis and Aeillo carry out their heists in time to music. It sounds much better than it plays. And one comes to the fast conclusion that this was less an interesting idea, then an attempt to allow Willis and Aeillo, neither particularly good singers, to defile some otherwise sturdy old standards.The plot - or whatever you call this - is so insane and all over the map that it is virtually incomprehensible. It plays like something someone wrote after a major bender and while still experiencing intermittent black-outs. A perfect example is the leading lady role. Andie MacDowell looks luminous, but literally seems to have no idea what she is doing in this film (nor do we for that matter). She is cast as an undercover secret agent nun dispatched by the Vatican to...who knows. Ironically casting MacDowell as a nun means that Willis does not have to waste time developing any romantic chemistry with her and, although she manages to be present for the film's concluding action scenes, she functions as little more than adornment or furniture for all the impact she has.The less said about Willis in the title role, the better. Grant and especially Bernhard are virtually unendurable contributing unwatchable performances as the Nick and Nora Charles of villainy. Truthfully, we never have much of an idea of what they are up to and they seem less villainous than simply an endurance test for the viewer, often shrieking their lines as though they caught their big toe in a mouse trap. Aeillo is equally appalling. With Do the Right Thing and Moonstruck, Aeillo seemed briefly to actually be a decent actor, before degenerating in whiny second banana/bad character roles. Here, he is supposed to be funny and winning, but instead seems oddly pathetic and has never more than here resembled an overgrown mutant man-child. One can easily see him cast as the big screen's Baby Huey with no make-up or costume required. At one point, his character seemingly hurls to a fiery death and one realizes what a relief it is to no longer have him on screen.Willis's vanity piece is perpetually dumb where it should be funny, smug where it should be clever, loud and chaotic where it should be exciting, boring where it should be fast-paced, and finally a complete waste of space and time.",Hudson Hawk
73,darrenbjones,Brilliantly funny slapstick adventure.,9,25 September 2018,"Bruce Willis in 1991 was still John McClane and after the high octane thrills of the first two Die Hard movies, this is what audiences were expecting. But this is far more Moonlighting than Nakotomi and audience expectations were not managed and sadly Hudson Hawk bombed.
It is however a brilliantly funny slapstick adventure. Hudson Hawk (Willis) gets out of prison only to be blackmailed into committing one more burglary, leading him down a rabbit hole filled with mafia, CIA, Vatican and ruthless billionaires all seeking to protect or exploit a 500 year old secret.
With it's tongue firmly in its cheek, the film runs through a series of entertaining set pieces with a dazzling array of colourful characters and a script full of music, jokes, bad language and cappuccinos.

74,MCL1150,Everyone's A Critic,3,10 May 2008,"Three Razzies? C'mon! I mean, not one ""Porky's"" nor even a single ""Police Academy"" earned a Razzie as worst picture of the year, so just how fixed ARE the Razzies?IMHO, the Razzies are a Hollywood scam. You know. Even bad publicity is good good publicity? Every film deserves to be seen at least once by anyone who loves movies. OK, so Hudson rates no more than one viewing, but it didn't deserve WORST FILM OF 1992. Just like Plan 9 shouldn't be tagged as Worst Film Ever. That honor should at least go to a $75,000,000 budgeted stinker. At least Ed D. Wood tried his best with what he had. Ed Wood also had a passion to make films and certainly wasn't in it for the $$$. And anyone who tried to revive the career of a Hollywood legend like Lugosi at least had his heart in the right place.My guess is that Hawk received the Bottom, or is that Top, Razzie because Willis ruffled too many feathers and the industry punished him accordingly.IMHO, Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"" should have fetched at least a Razzie nod if not the grand whammy itself! Talk about awful!As for me. I watched it once. Not as bad as some would have you believe, but do make sure to see it on DVD or at least on your TIVO box to avoid having to wait through four minute commercial breaks.

76,underfire35,HUDSON HAWK is Silly Fun.,7,22 March 2003,"HUDSON HAWK is a film people either love or they hate.  It is hard to say who is right.  I personally greatly enjoy this movie, but the case can be made, if you look at HUDSON HAWK in a certain light, that it is a terrible waste of time and money.  The story is high-concept, the actors chew the scenery, the plot makes little or no sense and it is over-directed almost to a fault.  The one thing that saves HUDSON HAWK as a film, is that it is damned entertaining. I do not contend that every film that is made has to have some lofty goal or socially important message to be successful.  HUDSON HAWK proves this statement.  The film-makers know it: Micheal Lehmann has not made a film as enjoyable before or since (has anyone seen MEET THE APPLEGATES?), but here he finds that ephemeral ""fine-line"" that allows the material to flourish.  The actors know it: observe Richard E. Grant as Darwin Mayflower, where else could such a fine actor get to cut loose like this (also, see Grant in HOW TO GET AHEAD IN ADVERTISING).  Bruce Willis is perfect for the lead role, I mean who takes Bruce Willis seriously?; he hams it up with sincere determination.  The screenwriters, including Willis, know it: timing bank robberies to 'Swinging on a Star', the secrets of Da Vinci's gold machine, Andie MacDowell chirping like a dolphin, CIA agents named after candybars...c'mon, this is not a serious dramatic effort. HUDSON HAWK is goofy, campy, ridiculous and inspired.  Will this film enter the archives of cinema history?  Answer: no.  I don't think that this film will even become a cult classic because it tries to hard to be quirky and weird.  It is destined to be forgotten in the wash of early 90's comedies, and is not the brightest spot in Willis' cannon (although that may not be saying much when you've got junk like COLOR OF NIGHT or STRIKING DISTANCE under your belt).  HUDSON HAWK will continue to be a fluke.  It is obvious that this was one of Willis' pet projects, and that he pushed it through to production.  HUDSON HAWK exists because of him...but without the support of the spirited cast and crew, this production could have been career ending.  So sit back and relax, its really not as bad as you've heard...  7/10",Hudson Hawk

The only punishment appropriate for the huddled mass of sheep is to be condemned to watch Gigli, another movie of which I strongly suspect ten claim is awful for every one who actually saw it.

81,Colonel Ted,For lovers of terrible films only,1,25 January 2000,"After watching (or surviving, I should say) this awful film I had the same buzz in my body that I've had after seeing superb films like Blade Runner, The Piano and even Willis newest film, The Sixth Sense. That is how bad Hudson Hawk really is and it has sealed my fate as a watcher of bad films! It actually starts well, with a couple of amusing jokes, but steadily plummets into a mire of bad jokes, dreadfully over the top performances and numbing action that make it thoroughly exhausting to watch as well as terrible. The plot has Willis forced to steal several artifacts for crooks, Bernhard and E. Grant, while being pursued by the CIA, with the help of sidekick, Aiello. However this is merely an excuse for Willis and producer Joel Silver to waste $40 million dollars on showing off, as if the audience has been invited to Hollywood party. You have to wonder as well whether they WERE drunk whilst making this film. The script is as weak as they get and it just seems to be an opportunity for Willis to show for his hip irony and `rare sense of humour' as he put it. It's a sad day for the human race when anyone thinks that the line: `You won't be attending that hat convention is July', after a bad guy gets his head cut off, is funny! True, the special effects are impressive and director Lehmann puts together some good action set pieces, but all that is drowned in the film's inherent stupidity, that numbs its audience to such and extent that nothing seems to register after a while. By the end we don't even feel sorry for a bunch of people who have seriously damaged their careers. Hudson Hawk is a truly awful film that no words could ever truly convey how bad it really is. It's quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen to date. And Christopher Columbus: The Discovery takes some beating.",Hudson Hawk
82,Venge,"In spite of being terrible, I enjoyed it",6,22 December 2019,"What can I say about this movie, that I just rewatched after more then 25 years. I enjoyed it, even while I was grimacing. I was laughing, even while I was groaning. It was like a combination of Airplane, Blazing Saddles and the worst B adventure movie ever made. Sometimes a clear ""1"", while other times bordering on a ""10"", I decided to split the difference, err on the side of generosity, and give this treasure a 6. Bruce Willis is always enjoyable to watch, Danny Aiello was a treasure, Andie MacDowell was a blast from the past, and James Coburn could still light up the screen with that great smile. The rest of the cast was, to put it mildly, absolutely abysmal. Sandra Bernhard was probably the most annoying actress of her generation, and though this part called for overacting, she took it way beyond the borders of what was bearable. Every time she was on screen, it was like fingernails on the chalkboard. Richard E. Grant was not far behind Bernhard in the ""too annoying to be believed"" category. If villains were judged by their ability to be unwatchable, than Grant and Bernhard were the most fearsome villains ever to grace the silver screen. Or they were just simply god-awful terrible. Most of the supporting cast were brutally weak, sounding like they were reading their lines off of cue cards. One startling exception was the very young David Caruso, playing the mute character, Kit Kat, who never really got a chance to bungle any lines.

86,jack_malvern,I once liked this. Then I saw it again.,4,3 August 2005,"It is a love-it-or-hate-it film, and I have done both. In days gone by I admired the mixture of absurdity and action: the car chase with Bruce Willis being dragged through the streets on a stretcher; the heists featuring skateboards, fishing rods and singing. So much so that I bought it on DVD. Oh, God.What I thought would be a nostalgic reunion was in fact an unpleasant awakening. Bad acting, contrived plots and glaring continuity errors are forgivable if the film is endearing, but there is an air of self-indulgence here that is just insulting.A typical slap in the face is the fate of Danny Aiello's character, who is driven off a cliff in a limousine which crashes and bursts into flames. Yet he appears at the end, to Willis's incredulity. ""Airbags! Can you f***ing believe it?"" Aiello shouts. What about the explosion, Willis inquires. ""Sprinkler system in the back! Can you f***ing believe it?"" Well, no, actually, we cannot be expected to believe it. Nor any of the other manifold jarring plot twists that seem to have been added to the script as a misguided attempt at a bit of fun.Richard E. Grant (whose performance is awful) wrote in his excellently bitchy autobiography With Nails that Aiello's survival was one of many late additions, often imposed by Willis, to a sprawling script packed with unfunny wisecracks. It grates, and it demonstrates that Willis should never have any role behind the camera.One thing I will say for the DVD is that the director's commentary is strangely compelling. Michael Lehmann is obviously aware of how crappily his film turned out, and chatters away about how it ""did very well in Europe"". The rest of his commentary reveals how he had to cut a third heist scene, set in Moscow, because of budget constraints, and how he had to hire the dreadful Andie MacDowell at the last minute because another actress withdrew.Should you, as other reviewers suggest, watch it and judge for yourself?

After watching several movies with him (Of Course he is one of my favorite Actors) I still find this movie one of his best.

89,mhthehammer,Too crowded and too limp,3,28 May 2020,"To say that this film is crazy and silly from start to finish is an absolute understatement. Hudson Hawk (Bruce Willis) and Tommy Five-Tone (Danny Aiello) are cat burglars who are blackmailed on a mission to steal Renaissance artifacts that contain diamonds. These diamonds are used to resurrect a Da Vinci alchemical machine that turns basic metals into gold. Of course, Hudson Hawk combines elements of tongue-and-cheek dark humor, Hope and Crosby adventure comedies, surreal humor, cartoony slapstick humor, and screwball comedy. However, a good chunk of why the movie doesn't work is because the humor doesn't impact the story at all or lead to anywhere, like the writers are presenting every over-the-top joke in a desperate attempt to grab the audience's attention. Worst of all, the writers wave their keys so often that it leaves no room for the movie to pause, breathe, and examine character, so the viewers are kept out of the movie's environment. Also, almost every minor character, including The Mayflowers (Richard E. Grant and Sandra Bernhard), Sister Anna (Andie MacDowell), the Mario Brothers (Frank Stallone and Carmine Zozzara), and CIA head George Kaplan (James Coburn) and his candy-named agents, are absolute hams, up to a point where they distract from the plot and jokes. To add insult to injury, no one seems to have a reason to behave that way, so the humor falls even flatter than before. It's actually a shame because I wanted to like this movie, as the out-of-context clips I saw before viewing weren't too bad and earned me a chuckle. However, in context, Hudson Hawk, while not without charm and with some impressive stunts, is all about behavior and restless humor, all without structure or meaning.

I'd been extraordinarily busy in the years surrounding the film's release, so a video with friends became my initiation, and I hadn't known the critical opinion.Hollywood casting is a 'no brainer' concept. People like Hugh Grant are musts for some roles. The same goes for Bruce Willis, who, while being a great actor with a diverse range of talents, is particularly brilliant with a type of role, like David in Moonlighting or Jimmy in Whole Nine Yards.Willis gags and great, tasteful music decorate Hudson Hawke like paint in a concrete unit. Characters are idiosyncratic and nothing should be taken seriously, except the fun.A curious relationship with the 'Da Vinci Code highlights the fact that neither story is strictly speaking, original, so much as descendant from folk tales and dreams. For me, this is what movies are about.",Hudson Hawk

However what my reviews will tell you is an everyday movie fans look at if it was entertaining and whether they did their job to telling a story. Don't listen to critics they have their own agendas.This movie won more Razzie awards than any movie released that year (1991) and was rated as one of Bruce Willis's worst movies (Obviously they didn't anticipate Once Upon a time in Venice). I think this is one of his best aside from Die Hard of course. This movie bring him back to what made him famous (Moonlighting), his comedic delivery and snarkieness make every scene work.The Cat Burglar has charm and an innocence that matches well with some slap stick and a great crime caper.

93,kdladage,Not a complete waste of time...,4,15 June 2005,"Hudson Hawk (Bruce Willis) is a thief. He is a thief that would like to be rehabilitated. But crooked cops, crooked CIA agents (with candy bar code names) and a comical pair of criminal masterminds do not want the world's greatest cat-burglar to go on the straight a narrow. In other words, this is not a serious film. It is a pure, silly, slapstick-like comedy that never touches on anything serious at all.Hudson Hawk is blackmailed into stealing three priceless DeVinci artifacts. Two of these are owned by the Vatican, so while he is being pushed by the various crooked individuals forcing his hand, he is being tailed by a Nun (Andie MacDowell) who is a secret agent of a Vatican order charged with protecting such things.As a comedy, the film is lacking. Although there are some funny moments, most of them are not handled very well. For example, one of the candy-bar agents (Kit Kat) never speaks, and always has a card with whatever he wanted to say written on it -- as though he planned everything that happens around him. This could have been funny had the character managed to have any depth so that that we might actually care what he has to say. But the character is as two dimensional as every other character in the film.The three bright exceptions to this cardboard character syndrome are Bruce Willis (as our lovable thief ""Hudson Hawk""), Andie MacDowell (as the Nun/Agent ""Anna Baragli"") and Danny Aiello (as the perfectly cast ""Tommy Five-Tone""). These three have a definite chemistry and play well off of each other. Had they actually had some decent writing to go with their talents, this film might have been a lot better.There is some potential in the movie -- and I firmly believe that had the film gone through a re-write or two by a seasoned screen-writer, this could have been an excellent film. The story is solid, but we never really get a feel for the crimes that Hudson is pulling off. They are in and out and over too quickly to appreciate.Overall, I would like to see this film re-made someday -- perhaps even with some of the original cast (Willins, MacDowell, and Aiello most definitely). I think that, given a second chance, this film could really shine.",Hudson Hawk

Has that sunk in? Do you feel the urge to scream, what in the holy living hell is he on about? You should do because Hudson Hawk is a dreadful, product placement veichle for Bruce Willis to mug the camera and do over the top things.It's a vanity project, and it's a shining example of what happens when people with power just don't give a rat's ass.

Hudson Hawk is the kind of movie made by stuck up, overpaid, clueless bastards with money to burn.Eddie Hawkins (Willis) is the Hudson Hawk, the greatest cat-burglar who ever lived and he has been blackmailed by the CIA and an OTT camp villain couple called The Mayflowers (Richard E. Grant and Sandra Bernhard). Against his will he is shipped off to Rome (literally) to steal some of DaVinci's greatest works. His friend Tommy (Danny Aiello) and an undercover nun (Andie MacDowell) assist him as he robs the Vatican and tries to shake off a bunch of MTV-generation CIA agents called the Candy Bars (Kit-Kat, Butterfinger, Snickers and Almond Joy).What a load of total and complete trash.

I know it's uneven. Somehow, that makes it more fun -- watching it, you'll wonder why someone thought this would work -- and when it does -- it's amazing, and when it doesn't -- it's amazing they did it anyway. Released at a time when audiences were expecting a new Die Hard from Willis, this was, instead, a parody of action films and a throwback to crazy plotted 60's spy films. It was sold as an action movie, but in actuality, it's a continuity defying, do anything for a laugh movie -- more Moonlighting for WIllis than Die Hard. Coburn is excellent as the evil CIA guy, and the rest of the players chew up their scenes nicely. I suspect for a lot of people in Generation X, this is a guilty pleasure, their requisite ""bad"" movie they love anyway. And I agree with other reviewers -- the directors commentary from Lehman is hilarious. One of the best I've heard on a DVD.",Hudson Hawk

This movie started off pretty good.  Then all the sudden I said to myself, what the heck am I watching.  This movie turned out to be absolute garbage.

98,kjs-2,Slapstick comedy with modern quirky humor,8,18 March 2003,"This movie is charming and sweet and crude and sharp and oh so funny! ""Hudson Hawk"" harks back to the great slapstick comedies of the past while advancing the genre to modern cinema standards. This is another film that has been made fun of a lot by the media but everyone I ask who has seen it all really like it. It seems to me that some films that are particularly dense or strange just turn some people off. Heaven forbid that they might have to pay attention and have an open mind to enjoy the quirky humor and sometimes frantic pace of the story and jokes in this film. I laughed just as hard the second time I saw the film and part of the reason for that is that I just couldn't catch all the jokes the first time around and what I did not miss (the first time) was so dense that by the time I wanted to see it again I had forgotten many of the jokes and plot details. Great movies, books, or music always surprise me when I see them again because they are always better than I remember. This movie surprised me when I saw it a second time and I bet the same will happen when I see it again. If you liked the fast-paced humor of ""In and Out"" or the slightly surreal slapstick of ""Taxi"" then this film will leave you in stitches. Filled to the brim with eccentric characters all perfectly cast and charm and goodness to spare this is a movie I will see many more times in my life (I have seen it twice so far) and I will probably laugh just as hard each time.

99,Jacques-Kinnaer,Entertainment at its best,9,10 February 2006,"This movie did not do well at the box office, and I honestly do not understand why. It is a funny movie, pure entertainment at its very best.At first sight, the story of this movie is fairly simple (as is to be expected from a story that Bruce Willis wrote), straightforward and rather stereotyped. The good thief is pressured by a bad cop to steal one more item. But the setting, which includes the Vatican, is quite unique and the humorous way the story unfolds makes me enjoy this movie every time I see it. Not the action movie that one has come to expect from Bruce Willis, but one of the funniest movies he ever made.",Hudson Hawk

Yeah it's dumb, yeah it's over the top, yeah it's crass, but who cares if your laughing your arse off all the time?Today I sat one of my friends down, she's 19, female, has barely even heard of Bruce Willis [really], so I sat her down just having watched another classic 'bad' film 'Cactus Jack' and I didn't give an opinion, she was just sitting about and I put it on and left her too it. It finished and what did she say? 'It was a crass over the top laughing stock, which I can mock for it's stupidity like I would a retarded child' nope. She said, and I quote 'That was a f**king cool film' 'Why have I never seen it?'That's the problem really, it's not a classic, it's not great but it is great entertainment. Sadly the critics and pretentious idiots who happily suck up critics opinions have killed the film, killed it dead. In fact they killed it as soon as it was born and that's the simple reason it made no money.The final reason as to why it's so cool? It lets me find out straight away if someone I know is gonna be a friend of mine. If they like it then they will be, if they don't then they are so closed minded that they will let other people's opinions interfere with their own fun.

In fact the ""singing thieves"" bit is in fact the best part of the movie. The story is a mess, the characters are forgettable, the performances are ridiculous. One might think they were GOING for laughs and absurdity here but that's not exactly the case as at every other turn they try to dazzle us with action and effects sequences. (explosions that go boom. whee.) It isn't funny. None of the over the top performances are funny. The plot has enough loopholes to make you think that the script was written by an 80's sitcom writer, and all of it smacks as bits left over from Willis' Moonlighting days. Thank God he eventually learned how to act three years later with Pulp Fiction.

But rest assured I know what i like and who knows maybe you are interested in this movie and would want to know what kind of person would actually love this movie since it seems so many actually don't like it.Well, i'm actually a big fan of Bruce Willis in Moonlighting and the Die-hard Movies. This one is like a good blend of the two. Overall the character here is quite similar in many respects to David Addison on Moonlighing except he's a former thief and was highly regarded as the best. He has a thing for singing songs just as he did in Moonlighting, yet here it's even more appropriate as the Hudson Hawk is familiar with song lengths in order to time how long it will take to do things.In writing this, I don't want to put any spoilers in here. But basically this is a caper film. It revolves around Bruce's character as he gets out of jail... and the caper he's forced into. Like Moonlighting, the movie really packs in a lot of overlapping talk, hidden jokes under lighter jokes, and an overall air of humor even in the toughest situations.OK maybe it's not a full 10 out of 10 movie... but i really love this movie and something has to counter some of those horrid reviews... right?",Hudson Hawk

Light-hearted, whimsical, almost Looney Tunes at times, this film was a breath of fresh air that I acquired and viewed out of a whim having read that it was a misunderstood comedy.

It instantly appealed to my warped sense of humor and my love of heist flicks.While certainly not a masterpiece (as many of the jokes fall flat), Hudson Hawk was vastly different from other action/comedies out in 1991.  It was a silly story told in an absurd way with very weird characters.  I think Hudson Hawk's closest cinematic cousin is Buckaroo Banzai in that both movies don't care about traditional story-telling techniques and conventions of their respective genres.For me, who will always love the odd and bizarre (such as 1999's Being John Malkovich), Hudson Hawk will remain a personal favorite.Where else can you find such a cool quip as:HUDSON HAWK (after decapitating a villain):  I guess you won't be attending that hat convention in July!Need I say more?",Hudson Hawk

I like wild movies, like The Holy Grail. I hated this. I stayed to the end, believing in Bruce up to the end, believing that it had finally hit its low - it could not possibly get any worse - only to be proven wrong again and again. I like the naked gun series; I like silly stuff. But it has to have something to hold it together! Until reading reviews on this site, I had no idea anybody anywhere could possibly like this &@#%!!

'DH' was such an amazingly kick-azz movie that Willis became THE new iconic action hero of modern cinema (making 'DH' the definitive action movie). For him to follow up with a bumbling comedy caught moviegoers way off-guard.Had this movie been made BEFORE 'DH' - when Willis was coming fresh off of his run on the hit dramedy series 'Moonlighting' - 'Hawk' probably would have fared better at the theater.Besides, the 1980's were chock-full of bumbling caper-comedies.",Hudson Hawk

The premise is fine, a singing cat-burglar makes about as much sense as a singing cat, but within the realm of a caper-comedy, this one is acceptable. The terrible sound editing and sub-par jokes however, are harder to forgive, along with the eternally bewildering Andie MacDowell. No matter how many films try to convince me otherwise by cramming her down my throat, I simply cannot understand the appeal. She is cast as the deep and soulful dream girl in Groundhog Day (truly not convincing as such) and here as the mysterious femme fatale. She is not believable in any part that is supposed to convince us to fall in love with her immediately, and here she does some terrible acting to boot. I have very few good things to say about this film - but I will say this.. it is always a pleasure to see a young, handsome Bruce Willis come on screen.

The Richard Grant and Sandra Bernhard do a superb evil duo impression. Danny Aiello and Bruce are constantly getting into and out of impossible situations and having fun and being funny while doing it. The bottom line here is that I don't think Bruce Willis intended this to be a serious film. It was a joke from the beginning and it provided a host of great and memorable laughs. When Bruce is on the hospital gurney and catches a cigarette, has a puff and then grimaces ""Ewww, Menthol"" and throws it away. I nearly split my side. To a non-smoker that probably isn't funny. As a former smoker and hater of menthol cigarettes I thought it was classic! Bottom line, the humor is subtle for this film. It relies on you to suspend your reality and you'll have a great time.

I don't care how cavalier a person might be, nobody is going to start singing out loud in a guarded museum.

120,philly-17,Great movie if you are willing to think unconventially,9,13 February 2004,"What I loved about this movie was how it took twists and turns different from anything I ever would have expected.   I had actually seen this movie in the theater, and expected to see a typical Bruce Willis action film. When the movie started, I actually wondered if I had entered the right theater.    Well, even though it started off strange, it just seemed to get stranger throughout the movie.  Many twists and turns, that you just have to go with.......the movie doesn't follow any sort of normal convention. However, if you can just let loose, I think this movie is great, much in part to the fact that it is so different from normal mainstream movies, but still provides the basic comedy and action that I enjoy.  I rate it an 8.",Hudson Hawk
121,Nick_Charles,Clever con-film,8,15 September 2005,"""Hudson Hawk"" is slightly smarter than it might appear. It seems like just another all-American ""saving the day"" film, but it's really not. In fact, the smallest country in the world plays a much more significant part in this plot.The hero, Hudson Hawk (Willis), is involuntarily hired to steal a number of original da Vinci items for two of the most revolting bad guys in history (Grant and Sandra Bernard), whose idea of fun is trying to control the world. The film revolves around a crystal that supposedly can turn lead into gold, but this is really just the story to tie in all the wise-cracks.The story isn't the main reason you watch the film. The wisecracks between Coburn, Aiello and Willis is the real reason. Also, the ""American lost in Europe""-routine is really good. If you're looking for symbolism, there is an interesting parallel between Hudson Hawk leaving prison and him leaving USA. In both cases he is like a stranger. In USA, things have changed (""What's Nintendo?""), in Europe things are simply different. Willis' portrayal of an American who believes he'll get by with speaking English and acting cool is excellent, especially when he orders pasta in passable Italian to impress the waiter and then asks for a bottle of ketchup, or, when seeing the Forum Romanum for the first time, he comments ""why have they left all these rocks in their back yard?"". This is typical Willis, he enjoys being the the schmuck to prove a point. And, as he always does, in this film he gets beat up a lot.As most of the film takes place in Italy, it is good to see that most, or even all, Italians actually are Italians and speak Italian. Most of them don't even speak English (which is true for 1990, and partly also for today). The Italy portrayed in this film is likely, unlike many other portrayals of European countries.There are imperfections, however. Maybe it's just me, but neither of the Mayflower couple (but especially Sandra Bernard and her dog) are any good, or even interesting. And while the pyrotechnics department is taking a holiday for most of the film, it is back with a vengeance in the last 20 or so minutes. The slapstick/Mtv routine can get tiresome. The film isn't exactly Bergmann, but it was never intended to be either. It contains some good cutting and all around good casting (in particular James Coburn being his own parody and Danny Aiello being, well, himself), and is mainly designed to entertain. Which it can do.",Hudson Hawk
122,Paul-116,Mind-numbing dross!,1,2 May 2001,"This is one of the worst films of all time. A terrible waste of money at $65 million. I could not find one redeeming feature in this whole sorry mess. I didn't smile once during the film (it was meant to be a comedy), and after five minutes I really wanted this to end. Willis' character was among the most annoying ever.

It's obvious Willis, Danny Aiello, Sandra Bernhard, et al are having a real giggle attempting to make the first Post-Cold War Cold War Comedy Heist Caper, and the movie starts out smoothly enough, but things quickly spiral out of control. Too many failed gags, too many eccentric performances. But I'll give you this: ""Hudson Hawk"" is a one-of-a-kind flick. Thank goodness.",Hudson Hawk

127,lance-62,A brilliant and crazy adventure/caper comedy for the ages,9,2 June 2008,"Take one part Three Stooges, one part Indiana Jones, one part...I dunno...The Time Machine? Baron Munchausen? The Fifth Element? The DaVinci Code? Then make all of your characters 25% or more insane, eat a bag of psychedelic mushrooms, and shoot for the stars. Voila! You have the Adventures of Hudson Hawk - the most underrated movie on IMDb.The insanity level of this movie cannot be overstated. From about 5 minutes in, the film begins to careen into a world of zany improbability. This is embraced rather wholeheartedly by all involved, from Sandra Bernhard and Richard E. Grant, to James Coburn and Andie MacDowell, to David Caruso (in a non-speaking role) as Kit Kat, and the rest of the candy bar crew.But don't write it off for its madness. What action adventure tale isn't far-fetched? So why not go for it, with the pedal to the metal in terms of wildness? Why wouldn't master cat-burglars use popular songs as a way to time out their burglaries? Sure they would! (Or, as Danny Aiello's character says, ""Fucking airbags! Would you believe it?!"") There are so many ways to end the sentence ""Hudson Hawk is worth watching just for..."". Here are a few: Hudson Hawk is worth watching just for......Sandra Bernhard at her something-est....James Coburn and the candy bar CIA crew....the outrageous adventure....the wise-cracking comedy....""Hey mister -- are you gonna die?""...Bruce Willis channeling David Addison....Andie MacDowell's ""speaking with the dolphins"", and other delirious exclamations (""You must pay the rent! But I can't pay the rent!"")...and so on.There's nothing like Hudson Hawk. It should've inspired a franchise, if you ask me. (Which you implicitly did.) Tommy: ""So what do you say Eddie...2 and a half minutes to save Anna, 3 and a half minutes to save the world...?"" Eddie: ""6-0-0. 'Side by Side'?""

128,bstormy,One of the Best Mel Brooks films he never made,9,19 July 2013,"At the time of release this film was poorly reviewed by critics who mistook it for a straight up action film with comedic pretensions. It is, in fact a straight up farce in the manner of Mel Brooks classics such as ""Blazing Saddles"" or ""High Anxiety"" - it even has musical numbers!That critics could fail to see this is perplexing, when many of them are educated men and women, with one would assume, a functioning sense of humor. It goes to show how big an effect expectations have upon a film.I don't think anyone watching today could fail to see that Hudson Hawk is a slapstick, knockabout comedy with some very entertaining characters, a unique idea and a very original and worthwhile film.Many people object that the plot is rambling and disconnected. Of course the 'plot' is ludicrous - but the plot matters about as much as the plot of ""Young Frankenstein"" or ""Monty Python & the Holy Grail"". It simply serves to set the scene for comedy sketches and throwaway gags, many of which are hilarious and inventively surreal.If this were billed as ""Terry Gilliams"" Hudson hawk, I think it would have done much better in critical circles. Written as it was by Bruce Willis, they were obviously more predisposed to dismiss it.All in All Hudson Hawk is an overlooked comedy classic full of inventive fun.Hudson",Hudson Hawk
129,Shimazu,Catch the Fun,8,6 May 1999,"Willis once again reprises his role as the reluctant hero that gets beat up throughout the course of the movie.  This seems to be his favorite role for it is used countless other times in movies such as Die Hard, and Fifth Element to name a few.  Hudson Hawk is unbelievable, corny, predictable, and sometimes just plain wild, but I found myself enjoying every moment.  I found myself enjoying the campiness and the corny action and hero lines. If you go to see a movie to be enriched socially, and intellectually, then avoid this movie, but if you what to enjoy two hours of comedy, action, and just plain fun then this would be a wise choice.",Hudson Hawk

At first I thought it was a mistake for first rate actors like Willis and McDowell to do such a bad movie, but after I saw it, I loved it. It made me laugh until my side hurt, and was worthy of it's own cult status. It was silly, rude, had toilet humor, political-incorrectness, and one-liners, but still kept a professional-movie feel to it, while full of style and grace. For this alone, it was worth seeing. But the jokes and the outlandish historical references pulled it off. -It also made my later trip to Italy much more entertaining! I give it a 9 out of 10.",Hudson Hawk

Loaded with quotable one-liners (see the list on IMDB) and more subtle humor (the name of the Italian American crime family is the Mario Brothers), this is a movie that gets better with every viewing.  The script was so densely packed that you can't take it all in in one sitting.Just when you think you know which way the plot goes, it twists and turns. If you're looking for satisfaction, all you need is this movie, a bottle of ketchup, and one of those unmasculine european coffee's known as a cappucino.Bruce Willis now wishes he never made this movie, but this movie is closer to his natural humorous style than anything he has done since he left TV.Not to mention, it's Sandra Bernhard's most challenging role to date.

Bruce Willis plays the title character (whose name comes from a song Willis was working on -- indeed the whole movie grew out of it; you hear it in the ending credits) with the same dry slapstick style he perfected on ""Moonlighting"".  But I can tell you the very instant the movie goes bad -- the first appearance of the Mayflowers.  I really think that their parts (and the braindead story around them) must have been written by somebody other than whoever wrote the other parts of the movie.  The whole Mayflower plotline (and the horrifc acting by Grant and particularly Bernhart) positively reeks.  If you can somehow get someone to record the movie and remove all their parts (which includes the climactic battle, but who cares?), you will actually enjoy this flick. If you have to sit through the Mayflowers, you lose (I did, and I'm doing you a favor by warning you.)",Hudson Hawk

There are other ""bad"" movies that a small percentage of people always like, like ""Ishtar"".  However, where Ishtar pretended that it was a good comedy, Hudson Hawk was filmed with the intention of making a bad movie.  Nothing serious was intended.  Everything from the acting and the dialog to the camera angles and special effects were intended to be over the top and FAR from believable.My suggestion is, one Sunday afternoon when you can't mow the lawn because it's raining, rent this movie, turn off your brain, and let it all wash over you.",Hudson Hawk

My husband also loves it and we have watched it many times together. It is funny and silly and I think that's why the critics hate it. If you're still a child at heart, you will probably love it.

After watching it, I can tell that those who thought it was a flop were expecting some kind of blockbuster.  Take this movie for what it is, a little poking of fun at an otherwise serious premise, two madpeople wishing to take over the world.  Darwin and Minerva Mayflower were hysterical and the candy bars were even funnier.  I'm not a huge fan of Caruso but his role of kit kat was actually pretty funny.  Willis and Aiello were really pretty good together and I've always thought that Willis was a comedian trapped in an action hero's body.

Though Citizen Kane (in a big screen revival) and Princess Mononoke both came close to unseating it.  Hudson Hawk is my favorite film because it understands it's a comedy, and keeps raising the ante as it goes along. Those who doubt that just watch the gurney ride on the Brooklyn Bridge.And for those of you freaked out by character's breaking into song, how come you never wonder about that when watching West Side Story, or The Sound of Music?

This is not a thinking person's film. It is a great way to escape into a fantasy world and relax. I actually just watched it on my PC with Netflix and had not heard of it before. It is a small film but great fun. I loved watching the locations and was surprised during the credits that Budapest was also part of the locations. I love Rome and was glad it was shot on location and not backdrop.

I am glad to say that the years have been kind to the ole singing cat burglar.Bruce Willis plays a smart-mouthed jailbird named Eddie Hawkins who has to steal DaVinci artifacts from the Vatican and elsewhere to help two rich twits rebuild Leonardo's ""gold machine"" and turn lead into gold. The movie is filled with bad wisecracks, those corny song-and-dance routines and gratuitous violence. Sandra Bernhard and Richard E. Grant are particularly grating on the nerves but there's enough warmth from Andie MacDowell's dolphin-tongued nun and sly in-jokes (James Coburn's presence alone) to make this light-hearted Hawk fly straight. And hey, it's almost as funny as ""The Da Vinci Code""!",Hudson Hawk
144,MCbirfday,Interesting spoof . . . Or is it?,6,2 January 2015,"Hudson Hawk is Bruce Willis' pet project in which he plays a world renown cat-burglar. Fresh out of jail, Hudson Hawk is forced to do a job by the mafia with his best friend Tommy. This one last job however spirals out of control and leads the Hawk all the way to Italy. Here he steals the works of Leonardo Da Vinci and unknowingly becomes part of a world domination plot by the CIA and a wealthy family.I've never heard of this movie until last night. My friend had recommended it saying that it was one of his favorites growing up. Being a fan of most Bruce Willis movies I decided to give it a try. After shaking off that skeptical feeling I have to say that from the beginning to the end I was hysterically laughing. The acting is over the top, the dialog is awful, the script is plot-hole riddled, but it delivers an effect that keeps the audience laughing. It's like a movie that's playing with the Indiana Jones adventure style of film making and spoofing it. However, it's hard to tell if the filmmakers of Hudson Hawk made these jokes intentionally. It is questionable whether the movie is a self-parody, or just an action-adventure made very poorly. For example the character of Hudson Hawk is clearly the worst cat-burglar around, despite his reputation. He sings loud jazz music through heists, skateboards past guards and takes his sweet time to open up a safe. It's clear that Hudson Hawk is anything but a professional, and it is hilarious to the audience to see him act so outlandish. The film might be doing this on purpose, but sometimes it seems that it's not aware it's doing this at all. Is this is a clever spoof movie, or a movie that just went hilariously wrong and is great to poke fun at?",Hudson Hawk

It's as funny as it's silly, and that's what makes it enjoyable. Characters are all dumb, the good guys are no saner than the cartoon-looking bad guys, the story is just the basement for a set of somehow childish jokes that, even being a grown up, I really enjoyed when I watched it a couple of decades ago. I decided to watch it again today, to find that it's still funny enough to have a nice time in the couch.",Hudson Hawk
146,kinetic-6,Pure Cult,6,25 November 2005,"Hudson Hawk is a film with a average beginning and a poor ending. But the middle is personal comedic bliss. This film is how I would define the the pinnacle of cult. It is definitely one of those films that you will adore or abhor. Just ride the film out past the introductory blather every film needs to build its world, let the film roll, and if the first heist doesn't get you laughing out loud, you might as well turn it off. Because if you don't like that scene, you may as well turn off the movie. The films humor maintains that style for the rest of the film. But if you like it, definitely keep watching. Because for the half to two-thirds of this film will be bliss to your demented humors. Hudson Hawk received a lot of initial bad press and bad reputation because it was very different, racy comedy/action film when everyone was expecting a variation of a Die Hard action film. And while not the bravest and boldest of film making adventures, it did challenge the edges on where an action/comedy's humor was able to tread. That is why it has out lived it's bad start out of the financial gates and is still talked about semi-occasionally and built a small but rabid group of fans. Hudson Hawk's premise creates an absurd world right from the start. Hudson Hawk is a master thief who is getting released from prison after serving a ten year sentence for a heist that was set up. Upon his release, his parole officer propositions him with a new job before he can even get out of the jail. Hawk discovers that the world has moved on without him in those ten years. Not that he was entirely up to date to begin with. He has yet to own a watch, but he knows the length of many popular songs and uses them to mark the time needed to commit his heists. Add in a demented butler with blades as cuff links, two psychotic antagonists, a nun as love interest, and a former CIA operative group whose nicknames are candy bars and the absurd glee only deepens. So if you are into absurd, quick paced humor this is your film. Just have patience with the beginning and the end.",Hudson Hawk

148,Maverick-Werewolf,"A highly underrated, good film - why was this bashed so badly?",10,25 June 2008,"I'll keep this short and sweet.Hudson Hawk wasn't just badly received when it came out - it was horribly received, and everyone tried to tear it to pieces. I disagree with the critics. This film is a shining success as a comedy, one that's lighthearted and makes you laugh every time. I've seen it a number of times now, and I still laugh hysterically at the jokes in the film.However, I'll admit the film isn't for everyone. You can't watch this film expecting another Die Hard, which I believe may have been part of the problem at the time of its release, but it's still great. What's there to complain about? It has hilarious jokes, great lines, outstanding actors (Bruce Willis is excellent in this film - but then again, he always is, so...), memorable characters (especially Hudson Hawk, who is easily my favorite, with Tommy Five-Tone probably in second), and a good story... and it's far better than basically ALL of the comedies released today. It was released ahead of its time, ""too hip for the room,"" as Bruce Willis put it. If this film had been released last, or this, year, it would've been a huge hit.As it is, the movie was trampled upon and beaten for no reason at all. I recommend this film to Bruce Willis fans, and fans of comedy, adventure, and probably action genres. It's a very enjoyable movie you're not likely to forget. I give it a 10\10, not only for the reasons previously stated, but also to combat all of you who hate this movie for reasons unknown to me. I have a few complaints, yes (mostly the Mayflowers), but overall this movie simply does NOT deserve even half of the flak it receives from everyone, and even if it had been rated 10\10 overall on IMDb, it still would've received a high rating from me otherwise. It's grossly underrated. I hate to see movies like this fail and be bashed while some other movies that may be very similar to it (not to mention far worse than it) be praised today.I wish it could've fared better, Bruce Willis & the rest of the cast\crew, wherever you are.

Sometimes, audiences just don't like a film that's smarter than they are, and I certainly believe that to be the case with this film.  It cross-references pop culture like mad, and asks that you be open to even the most outrageous plot twist.  Skulduggery in the Vatican, CIA operatives named after candy bars, timing burglaries with pop standards..... if only most Hollywood films exhibited this kind of go-for-broke creativity. Instead, we're ladled feel-good crap like PATCH ADAMS, or STEPMOM.Preston Sturges used to write with this kind of reckless abandon.  They'd probably pan his movies nowadays, as well.Also, if you look back on the climate in which this film was released, it came on the heels of Die Hard 2.

But don't be fooled you may be thinking this is going to be a great action movie, but trust me this is far from it. This movie is more like your Naked Gun Style with Lesley Nelson. I myself think this movies storyline would have made a great action movie which is Bruce Willis's speciality. Overall great Storyline but would have been better as an action movie I just cant see Willis as a Singing Cat Burglar.I recommend this movie to anyone who liked the Naked Gun Series and cheesy comedies with one-liners.

Maybe its simply my perception of things, but it appears to me as if this film has been covertly appreciated by those in the film industry, while the ""huddled masses"" missed the cue to do so.",Hudson Hawk
156,depastino,This movie defies classification.,9,3 April 2003,"If your personal all-time top ten list is populated with the likes of ""Schindler's List"" and ""On Golden Pond"", you will NOT enjoy this movie. If you feel that a movie should ""make a statement"" or, for that matter, have a point, you won't think much of Hudson Hawk. However, if you watch movies to be entertained and to have fun then I would highly recommend HH. It's not for everyone to be sure, and at times it suffers from a major identity crisis. But it's consistently funny without resorting to toilet humor like a lot of current comedy fare. Some of the jokes are incredibly stupid, but that's part of their charm. The characters are quirky, the stunts totally bizarre, and the dialogue a  perpetual stream of one-liners and in-jokes. The actors appear to be having a blast and it shows. It reminds me a lot of the old ""Carol Burnett Show"" in the way that the cast seems to be laughing as hard as the audience. The movie is rated 'R' for language, violence and the brutal, senseless slaying of several cappuccino's.",Hudson Hawk
157,ragnarok47,"Yet another film, hated by some, loved by others.",9,13 August 2003,"MSN just came out with a list of Hollywood's greatest bombs, turkeys, and flops.  This film was listed as number nine; a travesty.While true that the film did not make as much money as was spent, that seems to be a fluke combination of expensive sets, and just plain old bad timing in that the public wasn't in the mood for this movie at this time.The entire feel of the movie is very akin to the Fifth Element, also starring Bruce Willis.  Let's face it, both movies are comedies.  If you watch expecting a deep, subtle movie, just give up now.  Hudson Hawk is pun filled, featuring a plot starring the CIA, the Vatican (yeah, the Catholic Church is a main player), a common thief (Bruce Willis), and maniacal rich people (Sandra Bernhard in one of her few watchable moments).  This movie simply must be watched to be truly understood however; a description just won't do it justice.Plan on comedy and terrible, if mostly clean, puns.  Again, very similar in style and sense of humor to the Fifth Element (which is much more favorably ranked; maybe this genre just plays better in space).  I, personally, loved it, and while the box office seems to disagree, I think this is one movie that can be safely moved from the terrible movie rack to the cult hits...movies that were enjoyed only after their theatre run.I give it 9 out of 10.",Hudson Hawk

This movie is definitely not your typical action movie. Bruce Willis is hilarious as Eddie ""Hudson Hawk"" Hawkins and Danny Aiello as his partner Tommy Five-Tone was the perfect counterpart. Willis and Aiello created characters that will last a lifetime in the hearts of everyone with a sense for adventure and a need to fill their lives with laughter.Eddie ""Hudson hawk"" Hawkins is the worlds greatest cat burglar. Unfortunately, the day of his release from prison, he's immediately pressured into stealing priceless pieces of artwork created by Leonardo Da Vinci.

Not out of the ordinary. The thing that was unusual was that I was just about the only one laughing. Not only out loud, but almost to the point of distraction. The song references, the quick exchanges between Hawk and Tommy, the moronic gangster Mario brothers (Mario brothers!)...it's all funny. Richard E. Grant as the evil Darwin Mayflower is brilliant. Alfred, the Butler (just his name is funny) actually knocking someone out by pinching his neck? Come on! Why isn't anyone laughing at this?! The historical connections to da Vinci give the thing a very interesting through-line. This is a really funny movie that does not take itself too seriously.

It doesn't make any sense, it's not intended to, don't look for jokes, let the weirdness of the plot and characters find you and make you laugh.  I was expecting a conspiracy theory action flick and I was laughing after the second scene.  (If you were lucky enough to see this movie on The Movie Lounge on TBS as I was, you probably had a great time courtesy of Paul Gilmartin's hilarious analysis)Anyway, watch the movie but don't be prepared for a thought out plot or a thought out joke for that matter.

It's too bad that in the movie industry something this original is cast aside as stupid and pointless and we're left with such pearls that are obviously rip-offs of each other. This has action, comedy, romance, intrigue, music, madness, slapstick, all rolled into one neat bundle. I wish Bruce Willis and Michael Lehmann would be brave enough to get together and treat us to Hudson Hawk 2. I'm sure Danny and Andie would gladly come back for more Hawk, and I can only dream of the insanities and the commentaries that could be presented nowadays, on our total PC age. Politics, society, religion, the movie industry, it's all tackled at here, and could be done again! And the lines! Wow, this movie is almost entirely quotable! Come on guys, think of a sequel! It's not like Bruce Willis is doing any incredible movie these days...And if you haven't seen this because somebody told you it was a bad movie, open your mind and go watch it now!

It just goes further than most with a good helping of meta-fiction and comedy.Bruce Willis thinks that this was his best movie.  And I agree with him.Richard E Grant just knows how to over-act without over-acting.A 9 (I don't give anything a 10)Just remember - it is meant to be fun.,Hudson Hawk

I use this movie, and this movie alone to judge how intelligent a person is.  If they liked this movie, then it's definately worth my time getting to know them.  It shows me that they have an open mind, and a GREAT sense of humour.  That's what's needed for this movie.  Everyone thinks that this movie was intended to be a ""serious"" movie... Not at all.. it was a parody of itself.. It was brilliant.  I can't call myself a Bruce Willis fan.. I HATED the Sixth Sense.. One of the worst movies EVER, but I did enjoy Moonlighting....

I found it in the ""Action"" section, but it could very easily fall under the Comedy genre. Sure, it can be over the top at points, but when taken with a grain of salt, this movie balances out very nicely.  And while the plot is quite farfetched, we have forgotten that that's why fiction was created, to indulge ourselves in fantasy.  If you want absolute realism, then watch the news and stop complaining when someone utilizes their creative thought and turns out a decent film.  I say, rent this movie the next time you see it, and don't over think it.  Kudos to some very well done acting as well.",Hudson Hawk
169,Diapertime,Criminally Underrated,9,24 March 2011,"This is one of those movies that had the unfortunate luck to come out ahead of its time, much like other films such as Reservoir Dogs. But unlike Reservoir Dogs which gained a cult following, its very rare that i ever meet a person who has ever even SEEN Hudson Hawk let alone likes it.The movie is about a thief named Hawk who is blackmailed into robbing several museums the day he gets out of prison. He is meant to collect various works by DaVinci, which each contain pieces of an sculpture which can be used to direct a machine to turn lead into gold.The characters make it all work, Hawk and his friend Tommy have great chemistry, and the two main villains are delightfully over the top insane. Also the ensemble cast does a great job, EVERYone in this movie does something funny at some point. The main problem with the film is that it uses childish slapstick but was slapped with an R-rating due to a few scenes with some violence (hardly enough to even warrant an R rating but i digress) Its a underrated gem, and has the makings of a cult movie. If you like slapstick and popcorn movie entertainment Hudson Hawk is about all you could ask for. Its a comedy, action/adventure, mystery, with even some elements of Noir. Truly ahead of its time, and bursting with comedy, check it out!",Hudson Hawk

I felt so disappointed ! The story is just too complicated and too silly for a comedy. The whole jokes and humour comes flat and is not funny at all.Don't misunderstand me : I love comedies, from Chaplin to the Monthy Python, from movies by Howard Hawks, Billy Wilder or Ernst Lubitsch to ""a fish called Wanda"", ""4 weddings & a funeral"", ""commando"" or ""twins"" and so on. It's just that this is too much : lots of money and a good cast spoiled !With Willis, I would much rather see the ""die hard"" movies over and over..., and that's just what I suggest you to do !",Hudson Hawk
172,cpvivier,Fun to watch,8,13 March 2003,"Some movies take themselves too seriously, or try too hard to be funny. Hudson Hawk is neither. Nor, is it believable. If any of these things bother you in a movie, you probably won't get it. However, if you like to see movies making fun of movies, and story lines that just ask you to accept them in the guise of humor, then you'll love this one. I never understood why this movie didn't rate well. I liked it the first time I saw it.
Bruce Willis and Danny Aiello make a great team. Danny Aiello's role in this movie really made me want to seek out other films he was in. He's a subtly funny and self-deprecating actor when the role calls for it.<Spoiler ahead> To me the funniest thing is still the means that they use to ""Synchronize their watches"" before performing a ""job"". This always happens in any big spy/war/thief movies and they found a very entertaining way to work it in. Of course, it makes it more believable for those of you that remember what 45s are. </Spoiler over>",Hudson Hawk

The character interaction is excellent, the story line is inventive and the plat moves right along,it has everything that make a great movie. The first time I saw it I laugh so hard that I saw spots,and every time since then I still get spots, and of course a coughing fit.

A real blender of a movie, trying to be like 10 kinds of films/abominations one right after the other, and becoming unwatchable for the most part. If I had to guess I would say Bruce had too much of a hand in making this thing, but only in small chunks. Either that or the director went nuts during filming and starting mixing his meds to boot. Watching this movie one imagines, this is what it must be like to talk to one of those people with a multiple-personality disorder. I guess you could say it's a positive that you don't know what will happen next, other than the good guys win in the end. The only thing this movie is missing is a scene with some undead zombies, that would pretty much fill out the genre cavalcade.",Hudson Hawk

Where-else have you seen catburglars use songs to know how much time they have to finish their robbery. Bruce Willis is of course as brilliant as usual, and Danny Aiello and Richard E. Grant ain't bad either. And besides, Bruce Willis uses the Frase ""Reindeer-goatcheese-pizza"" just as he does in The Last Boyscout, and that's enough for me to make it a classic. Just see it for yourself; you won't be disappointed.8/10",Hudson Hawk

This is basically a live action cartoon, and that is how it should be taken. It's a comedy, it was meant to be funny. I don't think that all of the people who slam this film have actually watched it.My piece of advice is to watch this film as a comedy, where anything, no matter how unrealistic, can happen.  This movie is funny, try watching Bruce Willis and Danny Aiello together, they look like they are having a blast filming this.A good comedic effort, and deserves better than it gets.",Hudson Hawk
177,zenevangelion,One of my favorites,8,9 July 2003,"Whenever the subject of Hudson Hawk comes up during a conversation, it always lightens my heart to hear someone mention how much they liked it.""I don't know why everyone says it's so bad,"" they tell me, ""I liked it a lot. It was fun.""It IS fun, movie snobs be damned! Granted, it's written by the same man who brought us Street Fighter and Beverly Hills Cop III, but he also wrote Die Hard, so we can't totally hold it against him. Steven De Souza peppers this script with silly banter (""Hey, Tommy. Why'd they leave all these rocks and sh** in the yard?"" ""Those are called ruins, Eddie.""), insane characters (especially Darwin Mayflower, hilariously played over-the-top by Richard E. Grant) and some clever gimmicks.Personally, it's always nice to see Bruce Willis having fun when making a movie. You can tell he's obviously having a blast filming this, as are his co-stars. It does make me wonder why Hudson Hawk wants to have sex with Andie McDowell so badly, as she's not really that attractive (even though she's playing a nun, which should make her EXTRA hot). But then again, the character HAS been in prison for ten years, so I guess that makes sense.Having some friends over? Want to watch a silly movie you can laugh atand not take seriously? Love movies that have some great, repeatable lines (""How long were you in prison?"" ""Let's just say I never saw E.T."")? Rent Hudson Hawk, make the popcorn, pour the booze and enjoy a great comedy that deserves to be a cult classic.",Hudson Hawk

For me it's a guilty pleasure, it is so terrible that I can't help but to love it.Hudson Hawk is released from jail, only to be blackmailed back into the business of stealing.  Only this time, he's the pawn of a crazy Euro-trash couple.  Hilarity ensues... if you can call it that, and there is a happy ending.The pleasure of this movie is in the, ""Are you f'ing kidding me"" factor. Falling from a 30 story building they have just robbed and somehow landing in a lazyboy... that happens to be their meeting point with the boss. Segue?  What's a segue?  Flying off a cliff in a limo and surviving. Plungers with bombs on them.  Don't believe it?  Then don't bother.

But that doesn't mean that I don't find American films hilarious and this is one of them! I genuinely laughed out loud several times during this film. I haven't seen this kind of wacky comedy since Police Academy. If you like Police Academy, you'll like this. These types of comedies are not supposed to be taken seriously, they are purposely ridiculous. Bruce Willis and Danny Aiello work brilliantly together in this film and they even share a lovely duet of 'Swinging On A Star' together, both have wonderful voices. Although Richard. E. Grant criticises this film as he is embarrassed by the films bad reception (how fickle), this is actually his finest performance to-date. This is one of my favourite films and if you were toying with the idea of watching it but were put-off by the reviews, don't be! I highly recommend it!",Hudson Hawk
181,trapani2,Pretty bad....,3,7 March 2012,"What doesn't work? Where to begin: the entire supporting cast, with the stone-faced Andie MacDowell proving yet again why she's the worst actress to ever appear on the big screen. I don't know what's worse- the fact that she cannot express any emotion or the fact that every time she tries to she looks hideous, bucktoothed and backwards and paper-bag ugly. Speaking of ugly we're also treated to uber-nothing Sandra Bernhard as one of the villains, and you only have to watch her for ten seconds before it's plain she has no talent whatsoever. Last time I saw her was Nick @ Nite hosting the ""America's Funniest Mom"" Competition. That seems about right. Richard E. Grant as her villain partner is equally loathsome, and you'll come out of the movie literally hating the both of them. Gangsters and goons appear and disappear with no logical progression, David Caruso appears as a mute who holds up a card that reads: ""My name is Kit-Kat. This is not a dream,"" and Bruce Willis breaks the fourth wall by smirking directly to the audience and delivering wry one-liners about the quality of the film. We didn't need him to tell us it sucks.So anyway I watched the movie just recently, fifteen years later, with an open mind and no hype to distract me... it's still terrible. The fact that so many people here are saying good things about the movie honestly frightens me... I think they find it outrageous to proclaim one of the world's worst movies was really ""not that bad."" I don't know about you but I look for more than ""not that bad"" out of my viewing experiences. The movie was such a failure many predicted it would kill Willis' career, and while the critics were nasty about him and the movie they were not wrong. Hudson Hawk literally wiped the smirk off of Willis' face for a long while and brought one of Hollywood's biggest stars down to Earth for a much-needed reality check.",Hudson Hawk
182,jemmo-1,Bizarre,3,9 April 2008,"A live action film made to play like a cartoon, but which doesn't really work as either. I got the feeling that the makers were taking the business of making something light hearted really really seriously.The jokes are so cheap (""There are 640 Wongs in the phone book!"" ""That's a lot of Wong numbers!"") that it's hard to raise a smile at the script, but some of the set scenes, like the theft of the horse statue that starts it all, are actually really nice ideas.Presumably if Willis hadn't been behind it, it wouldn't have had a chance of getting great actors like Richard E Grant involved, or even of being made. The plot is nonsense, the dialogue forced, the editing awful, the jokes thin and the acting several steps beyond hammy.

183,markwaldbc,"30 years later, a cult classic",7,14 June 2021,"As the title of my review suggests, this movie got better with age. Don't believe me, check out the reviews. Check out the score timeline. The more time expires, the higher the ratings. That's because when this came out it was panned as a vanity piece - a work of Bruce's ego. But it really wasn't. It was a bunch of mostly A list actors at the time having fun with the script and in general, over acting every scene. When I first saw it, I laughed the entire movie and then the hate started. This was pre-internet so it was mostly movies reviews in magazines or TV like Siskel and Ebert. I began to wonder if there was something wrong with my humor. Was it me? What did I miss? Or was it simply some people just didn't get it. I think it was the latter and with the internet to quickly overrule the critics, this movie went down the tubes.So it depends on how you approach it. If you look at it as a serious ""Cat Burglar"" or ""Heist"" movie, you're going to say, ""WTF did I just watch?"" If you watch with a big bowl of popcorn and want to se some actors having fun with a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, you'll like it. Bruce said him self in several interviews that Hudson Hawk was intended as a satire of the genre. He insisted the absurdity was supposed to be part of the charm. Meant to be a joke, but few at the time saw the funny side. If it had been made, just a few years later, maybe after Pulp Fiction, it could have been viewed differently. Don't panic - I am not comparing Pulp Fiction with Hudson Hawk. Where Pulp Fiction sewed comedy and drama perfectly, Hudson Hawk was ham-fisted and comically awkward. Both were ahead of their time with it's mixture of genres: the movie spoof and a violent action film common of the time. Audiences and critics weren't ready for Hudson Hawk's sometimes shaky deliver and thus, by and large generally misunderstood since it fit into neither category neatly.",Hudson Hawk

This is a comedy using action as the vehicle, so it's tongue in cheek stunts all the way. However, unlike typical spoof movies where series of skits get tied together for the sake of trying to appear clever, this all flows together seamlessly into a great heist caper.I've seen this movie many times in the 20 years it has been out, and I'm always picking up more gags that I missed the previous watch.There are very few comedies that appeal to all, but if a lot of fast banter in a plot that moves at a rollicking pace carrying the unwilling protagonist along with it sounds like fun to you, Hudson Hawk will be worth a watch.The one let down for me is Andie McDowell, who tries pitifully to keep up with the wise-cracking cast, but just comes across a bit awkward.",Hudson Hawk

Well I doubt that very much, but it is a cruel fact that when this gem was released it didn't receive the reaction it deserved. Que a few years on the movie store shelf, some slightly brighter viewers and an audience just waiting for the hilarity of the early 90s and Hudson Hawk was back.Perhaps the greatest piece of brilliance in this whole film is the meta-cinematic perspective taken by Willis. What is so hilarious about Hawk is that after years of Willis making movies which expected us to believe that these characters could survive all these harrowing tumbles and falls, he turns around and says, yeah, that doesn't make a whole lot of sense does it? When Aiello returns from a particularly gruesome accident Bruce actually says, ""yeah, okay, I can believe that."" He is admitting that he too will suspend his disbelief to enjoy the events around him, just as we as viewers of all his classics have as well.It's great over the top acting, and if you can track down a recording of Willis and Aiello singing ""Swingin' on a Star"" I can promise it will get stuck in your CD player for weeks. It's a great film, probably the best cult action classic from the 90s. If you can catch the Hawk, it's definitely worth the two hours.",Hudson Hawk

The humour in it seems so *English* (possibly because a lot of it is very camp) and it's the only film I've ever been able to stand Andie MacDowell in (except possibly Groundhog Day).Bruce made this film as a vanity project, and stuffed it with all his mates - which is why Danny Aiello survives being thrown off a cliff in a car that bursts into flames - Danny decided he was going to survive after Bruce had already gone home, and no-one could say no to him :-)If you like your humour zany to the point of surrealism, peppered with lots of quotable lines, then this might be the film for you too. It was by all accounts a total disaster to make as well as a box office flop - but it has cult written all over it. I never understood why it was hated so much by so many people.",Hudson Hawk
190,dutch_raven,"I do not understand why people would rate it low, I've fallen in love...",8,18 November 2005,"with the movie that is.. It makes me feel good, I think it's funny even after watching it a couple of times. Warm, uplifting and a bit odd. My kind of chocolate pie.I like Bruce Willis in comedy and his acting works well with Andy and Danny's I think. The villains are something from another planet! (figuratively speaking) It's very light comedy, very very light. And if you like a night of relaxing entertainment hanging out on the couch alone, with your mate or with the family, I would say yeah go for it. If you are more of a critic and a movie has to ""mean something"" or ""go deep"" or ""very real"" or something else of ""higher quality"", better not choose this one. It's way too flaky. I don't think it's meant to be anything more or less than a feel good movie. When you watch it, don't think, let your mind forget about the stress of daily duties, just go with it thoughtlessly and let the atmosphere tickle your funny-bone.And it's also probably just a matter of taste.. I've read reviews that burned this movie down completely... so it's at your own 'risk'. It's for easygoing people who appreciate that kind of goofyness I guess ;-)",Hudson Hawk

People say ""Blazing Saddles"" is hysterically funny, what's different about ""Hudson Hawk""? It's a spoof, it's funny, that was the point. It wasn't meant as a serious action film, the actors weren't trying to make a political statement, it was supposed to be a tongue-in-cheek fun time. It succeeded in spades. It's one of the few movies that everybody in my household can agree on as being great to watch. And we don't agree on much! One of the 100 worst movies? I think not!! I think it's way funnier than ""Blazing Saddles"" or ""Airplane"". See it, then judge for yourself. Don't go in thinking it's an action film. It's a spoof, and a darn funny one at that!",Hudson Hawk

Danny Aiello and Bruce Willis were perfect for the roles of Tommy and Hudson Hawk, not to mention the numerous others who made this movie hilarious.  Sandra Bernhard made an excellent villain, and Andi Macdowell was no less than perfect in her performance.  This movie was very under-rated.  I give it an A+.",Hudson Hawk

I am also never surprised by the number of people I lend the video to, who bring it back and say, ""That was brilliant!""This film is a classic example of what a movie critic can do.  It was panned by just about everyone and, as a result, the film flopped big time.  But did it deserve it?  The answer is a big fat, ""NO!""This film is one of my all time favourites and one of the funniest films you are ever likely to see.  It doesn't pretend to be anything that it's not. It's just great fun.There is no-one that could play the part of the ""Hawk"" except Bruce Willis and this film is far from being the lowest point of his career. This is a film that has seen great injustice.  I can't begin to list the number of reviews I have read in the last year or so for the top 10 biggest flops of all time.  And each time they get to Hudson Hawk they say the same thing, ""Why?"" These are probably the same critics who panned it when it first came out for fear of going against the grain.  If only they'd been brave enough to speak up then.It has great locations, a genuinely funny script, a fabulous original idea, wonderful cast (Minerva is a classic character) and a quirkiness that is missing from a lot of Bruces' work.I have seen this film over and over again and laugh every time at it's brilliance.  It doesn't set out to be an Academy Award winning epic it just says, ""Shut up, sit down and let me entertain you for a couple of hours."" And that's exactly what it does.  If you ever look for anything more than this from a film then it's time to call it a day.  Wonderful, is the word, and I'll be watching it again soon.",Hudson Hawk
196,mpangerl,This will someday become a classic.,9,21 August 2000,"Some movies come along that no one is ready for.  This is one of them. Hudson Hawk is always off-center and insanely quirky.  The jokes are dumb, dry, hilarious, and unexplainable. The plot is goofy and very unpredictable.  That's why I love this movie. Fifty years from now this will be considered a classic.  It was hated during it's first release just as Citizen Kane was.  There is hope for this movie. Another charming point about Hudson Hawk is the over-acting and the ludicrous antics of the stars.  Bruce Willis smirks more, Danny Aiello plays over-Italian and the rest of the cast hams it up wonderfully.  You either love this movie or hate it.  I LLLLLLLove it!",Hudson Hawk

Famous smirk, crooning voice and smart image what more could a fan ask for;) It is a pity the critics trashed the movie, it had a corny theme, is cartoonish and all in jest.

Yeah, some people think it's a little corny.. but I actually enjoyed this movie. If you haven't seen it you can probably buy it for around $5. It's worth it.It had good character development a ""fair"" story and LOTS of great gags (my personal favorite is: ""there's 657 Wongs in the phone book... that's a hell of a lotta Wong numbers!"" then they play ""Chinese"" music in the background. You just can't beat that!! If you haven't seen the movie... Bruce Willis plays a cat burglar that just gets out of prison (Aiello is his partner) and they pull of HUGE capers with low tech. They don't even use stop watches to keep track of time... they sing songs (like swingin' on a star) to keep pace. Truly funny.Slainte!! -D",Hudson Hawk

Perhaps they are too used to having every funny line spelled out for them in the crap that passes for comedy these days, perhaps the dumbing down of society has reached such a point where the average IQ has fallen back to double digits, who knows.Hudson Hawk is a classic, it is a unique movie that requires you to abandon all preconceptions of what you expect it to be. Put simply, forget about what you want it to be and enjoy it for what it is!If you can't enjoy this movie, don't understand the puns, then I feel sorry for you. If you get what this movie was meant to achieve, then ignore the sheep-like critics (sorry, that's an insult to sheep) and just keep enjoying it...",Hudson Hawk

Overall a very good movie.If you like Monty Python, Underover Blues (K.Turner/D. Quaid), you will probably get a real kick out of this one.Enjoy!",Hudson Hawk

This movie demands that you watch it at the right time and in the right frame of mind. Watch late at night after a few beers or whatever and let it suck you in. There is a lot about this film that is perfect. Once you accept that it is ""fantasy-comedy"" ,to coin a genre, the music, acting, direction and clever writing will win you over. This is not a Saturday afternoon popcorn movie, give it a chance and make up your own mind.

If the answer is yes, you will like Hudson Hawk.I evaluate film on two criteria.  First, is it an important piece of art? Second, did it entertain me?  Hudson Hawk is not an important piece of art but it sure as hell entertains me.  Those who insist on searching for the Meaning of Life (another film that falls into this category) should look elsewhere-might I suggest The Seventh Seal.My advice for anyone who has laughed themselves to tears watching the Coyote survive yet another 1000 foot drop(we know who we are)is as follows; grab one or more adult beverages (if you are of legal drinking age), kick back in your favorite chair, and enjoy.As a final point, does anyone else find it interesting that HH features a Bing Crosby tune when the nearest movie comparison I can draw to it would be the ""Road to..."" series?",Hudson Hawk
207,AlphaFactor,Hell yeah!!,10,14 December 2002,"Truly a movie that is best enjoyed in of itself, not by comparing it to other ho-hum motion pictures from the scattered vaults of American cinema!!Fresh, hip, and savvy... Hudson Hawk isn't meant to be basked in by the establishment. Hell, if anything, Hudson Hawk MAKES FUN OF the establishment!! Hudson Hawk moans Tommy's bar being converted into a coffee-house for Wall Street yuppies... It prods art-critics as being in a world of their own... Questions why they leave ruins lying around in Rome particularly when they're actually CALLED ruins... The anti-establishment premise maxes out by bringing-in snobby billionaires hellbent on world domination as the story's villains.The unlikely heroes in Hudson Hawk are a pair of cat-burglars from upper Jersey one of which was recently paroled from jail. After reminiscing about how things used to be and how they've changed with the elitists and the snobs taking over everything in the past 10years, they get blackmailed by the Mario Brothers (the Jersey Mafia in this case) to go rob a museum. Narrowly sneaking past death in accomplishing that, they try to back-away from their life of crime. Fate's dealt them an odd hand, however, and before they know it, the CIA, the Mob, and a billion-dollar crime empire have them by the napes of their necks with an offer they can't refuse: WORK FOR US OR DIE.Hudson Hawk revels in the cynical - with Bruce Willis (aka Hudson Hawk) tossing out one-liner after one-liner. Its American flavor is enhanced further with inside jokes (eg ""Will you play Nintendo with me?"") and stock-characters (eg Igg and Ook, the mute, ruthless, twin henchmen) interwoven throughout. Oh yeah, and in spite of the odds, the GOOD GUYS WIN!!Final word of advice? If you haven't seen Hudson Hawk, go see it. But don't go see it with the intention of judging it beforehand, instead, just kick back and enjoy in the laughter.

209,meri-frost,Very entertaining and clever spoof!,7,12 April 2008,"Hudson Hawk may be rated by movie critics as one of the worst movies, but they got this one wrong. Hudson Hawk is a very clever spoof movie containing action, adventure, romance, humor, wit, friendship and a plot line that follows through. You really have to know you history to get some of the wit involved in this movie. I love those references to Flint, North by Northwest, The Last Boyscout, Sylvester Stalone, Mario Brothers, ET, Da Vinci/Mona Lisa, the butler, and maybe more. David Caruso plays a wonderful Kit Kat, and you'd never guess that Butterfinger (Andrew Bryniarski) would play Leatherface in Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Both James Coburn and Danny Aiello play wonderful supporting actors, and who doesn't love Bruce Willis and Andie MacDowell! Sandra Bernhard and Richard Grant are just hysterical as the Mayflowers. There has to be some sort of do-over on this one. It's available on DVD and worth buying!",Hudson Hawk

212,MorningBoredom,Mindless Comedy with a great sound track,8,5 June 2003,"Many things have been said and written about Hudson Hawk, but one thing that many people can agree on is the fact that the movie has a great soundtrack. As an audiophile, any movie that contains old jazz pop songs will always get my approval. The playful music works perfectly with the mindless dialogue and plot. To understand what I mean by the last statement, just watch the ""Swinging on a Star"" scene. This scene always brings a huge smile to my face. The scene is great because you learn two things 1) Stealing priceless art is easy and fun and 2) Bruce Willis can actually sing.Regarding the non-musical scenes, one might find themselves wondering ""What the hell is going on?"". To best enjoy the movie, I recommend you ignore plot holes, random characters, bad editing, and cliche puns.

215,holowastick,Unacknowledged masterpiece of american cinematograph,10,13 December 2003,"This movie is considered to be Bruce Willis' biggest flop. Critics used to say that it was nothing but unsuccessful mockery. That's right, this movie is laughing at you continuously, but it's wrong to get irritated by that. It's much better to laugh along with it. American viewers didn't like it because they never managed to classify it. Was it a parody or action movie? If it is an action - why it's so frivolous? And if it's a parody - why sometimes it becomes way too serious? I think a one shouldn't be so genre dependant, in this case especially it is not significant at all. What really matters is a wonderful dynamic plot with great twists, good mixture of subtle and farcical humor and, of course, remarkable and unique set of personalities. They are all brilliant - Bruce Willis himself, Sandra Bernhard's Minerva Mayflower, silent KitKat, english butler, emaciated enzygotic twins, in a word - all.Till now it is my favorite Willis movie.",Hudson Hawk
216,darigaaz,Fun to watch if you know how,8,27 February 2004,"What I notice about this film is that a lot of people expect this to be a true action movie, probably because of the other action movies Bruce Willis has made. This makes one miss out on the fun of the movie imo. This film takes the action part of an action movie and puts it a little  over the top. This together with, what I like to call sillyness (i.e. the CIA-agents are named after candybars), makes this film fun to watch. Viewing this film as a pure Willis-action movie is the same as viewing Mel Brooks' 'Spaceballs' as a pure Sci-Fi movie imo, which, I hope we can all agree on, it is not. 'Hudson Hawk' should be viewed lightly and with the right type of film in mind (action/comedy instead of pure action). Of course it also depends on your sense of humor, but if you like movies like 'Spaceballs' and 'Airplane!', you'll like this one too, though it's not quite the same genre.",Hudson Hawk

One day at work, the theater was giving away movie promotional extras left over from years past to the employees. One of the items was a promotional T-Shirt for Hudson Hawk. Being a fan of Bruce Willis and a fan of t-shirts, I picked it up. I also decided that if I was going to wear the shirt, I might as well see the movie.I had heard the rumors: bad bad Bruce Willis vanity project, not worth a damn, much less a rental. Well, that sounded like a challenge to me! So, I rented it, popped it into my VCR and prepared to be in agony. I was very disappointed.I was stunned at not only how madcap it was, but how well written it was. Sure, it felt like an excuse to rattle off witty one-liners amongst a non-sensical plot, but it did it so WELL. Some of my favorite lines from any movie are in this film.""How long (were in you prison)?"" ""Let's just say I never saw E.T.""Some of the references are very early-mid 90s, as to be expected. Still, there's some great, wacky characters, and it's just a good stupid caper movie. Don't listen to the critics - this one is definitely a great film to watch with a group of friends.",Hudson Hawk

A ""Desert Island Download,"" for sure, one of my top ten! (I've been spouting great quotes from this movie since it came out!) Pure entertainment. The only reason I gave this one 9 stars and not ten, is that it's a tiny bit long for this kind of movie. But, I can see why they had a hard time cutting anything, really. I wish they'd make a sequel! Hudson Hawk has a laugh-out-loud zaniness to it that just sticks with you. Even though I've practically memorized the script, whenever I'm reminded of it, I just have to watch it again. ""Hey Mister! Are you gonna die?"" ""Exact change!!??"" ""Ceasar! Anthony!

Willis plays a great role as a smart-mouthed anti-hero forced into a ridiculous set of circumstances. I highly recommend the movie if you like movies such as ""Airplane!"", ""Naked Gun!"" or ""The Hangover."" Some of the plot points truly make no sense such as the auction scene. But if you can get passed these bad points of the movie it really shines. Not Bruce's best stuff but certainly up there. The location is really great as well.

The supporting characters are cross between the riddler and barney.

I'd also read about the making of the film in Richard E. Grant's excellent film diaries ""With Nails"", so I was fairly curious and willing to be pleasantly surprised.Well the critics were right.The problem is none of the actors have the comic ability to play it for laughs(except possibly Aiello) and the script isn't strong enough to be a quirky action adventure. It's not funny, nor is it exciting. It might have been a half decent heist movie, but the robberies are played for comedy rather than suspense. The cast and the script aren't funny enough to call it a comedy, the film isn't stylish enough to be cool, or knowing enough to be 'so bad its good'. It's just pretty bad.Sorry to stick the boot in, but really, if you are considering it, don't bother.",Hudson Hawk

Maybe the critics were expecting an action packed thriller or drama? But given Willis' popularity in Moonlighting (was that what his TV series was called?), and the character which he portrayed in it, it seems natural to expect that kind of camp and tongue-in-cheek humor. I thoroughly enjoyed it when I rented it way back then, and again even now in 2005.The movie laughs at other movies, itself, the actors seem to have a great time during the movie, and the chemistry between all the characters seems genuine and good.Enjoy the fun, and don't think too hard about it.",Hudson Hawk

It was a fun caper flick with some funny twists and some really crazy characters. Hawk has a special comradery wiyh Aiello, and it really showcases Williss' comedic side. Think Die Hard, with a softer plot and much more comedy...... All in all it is a fun ride, and a great caper. Watch this movie a try not to laugh",Hudson Hawk
