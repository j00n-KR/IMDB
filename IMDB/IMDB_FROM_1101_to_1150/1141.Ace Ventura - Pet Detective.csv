0,TheLittleSongbird,The film that made Jim Carrey an overnight sensation...,8,26 January 2011,"While Ace Ventura:Pet Detective is not my favourite of Jim Carrey's movie, it is a lot of fun. It may be a tad too short, and some of the silliness is overdone. But even with any problems, that still doesn't change the fact that I enjoyed this film immensely. The film looks good with the cinematography and scenery top notch. The script is incredibly funny and I like to quote it too. The story is quite silly, but it is a nice one too, and the film is also very snappily paced. Tom Shadyac's direction is also very energetic and imaginative. This was the film that made Jim Carrey an overnight sensation and a fine one it is too to receive that honour. He is excellent in this film, his style of humour mayn't be for everybody, but when he is at his best he is funny or nicely understated as he is in his dramas. All in all, fast, furious and fun. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
1,SnoopyStyle,Jim Carrey's crazy antics,6,29 September 2013,"Pet Detective Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) is the man you call when crimes happen to animals. When Miami Dolphins' mascot dolphin Snowflake is stolen from its watertank, team official Melissa Robinson (Courteney Cox) must ask Ace Ventura to investigate. Police Lieutenant Lois Einhorn (Sean Young) hates the brash pet detective, but he always seems to be out-think everyone.Jim Carrey has made a virtue of going over the top. And he is extremely virtuous in this movie. He's at his rubbery best playing with animals and talking thru his butt. It's shocking at first. Then it gets cute. Then it gets a bit tired but the movie ends before it became annoying. For some, the movie probably didn't end soon enough. The antics get tiring. It just doesn't end. Although the final reveal is hilarious. The movie is just good enough to be fun.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
2,mark.waltz,"Jim Carrey proves, ""You are what you imitate.""",1,29 September 2016,"...and that being fake talking buttocks. Yes, that's the humor mentality that drives this trashy comedy that took another sketch comic from TV and moved them into the big screen. Carrey's schtick can get pretty tired really fast, and while he tried to tone it down in later films, did not have a memorable start in spite of box office success. The fact that his idiocy doesn't get him punched out (or worse) is head shaking. So once teenage boys and post teenage boys who never matured got him onto the list of top box office draws. For the rest of us, we stuck with our Hope and Crosby ""Road"" collection.I did laugh a few times (especially at the mincing muscle man whom Carrey for some reason checks out while using the urinal, followed by the eye roll), but I have to say, these films do not hold up with the exception of a few sequences taken out of context. I can't say if I would have laughed more when I was younger, but I really doubt it would have been much more. Ace Ventura is simply crude, idiotic and beyond annoying in every single aspect.So for the plot...it surrounds the escapades of the moronic pet detective hired to find the Miami dolphin's mascot, kidnapped right before the super bowl. Ventura, who has a collection of some cute (and not so cute) wild creatures, and perhaps they understand him, because he's definitely not human. What moments I did laugh at were almost embarrassing to me, and as a result, I could barely make it through.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
3,kosmasp,Obvious,6,21 July 2009,"If the movie was only called Ace Ventura, than I guess it would be a spoiler, to talk about Jim Careys job/character in this movie. But since it's pretty obvious what he does, I won't be taking too much away. Not that that is really possible, because the story is pretty thin as it is.But Jim Carey (who alongside ""The Mask"") got pretty popular with this movie, has an energy that is really breath taking. Even if you don't really like his attitude or his characters, you can't deny his dedication to ""milk"" (no pun intended) the most out of everything he does. And the same goes here, where he acts pretty ridiculous, but while others might have had a safe routine, he dares to do things, you wouldn't expect to see ... And while the movie has it's flaws, it's a pretty enjoyable watch",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
4,lee_eisenberg,"""Lee, he's crazy!""",10,7 July 2005,"We saw ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" right after ""The Mask"" came out. We could not have possibly predicted how wacky it would be. At the moment when Jim Carrey started butt-talking, my dad shouted out: ""Lee, he's crazy!"" And believe you me, he really was. Anyone who knows anything about the movie probably knows that Carrey plays the title character, who has to find the Miami Dolphins' mascot. But mostly, the whole movie is an excuse for him to be silly. And of course, the woman who played reporter Melissa (Courtney Cox) went on to play the reporter in the ""Scream"" trilogy.Well anyway, Ace Ventura really is a master of disguise, and it's almost hard to believe that after almost ten years of stagnation in comedy, this movie came and changed the way that we think about humor. Hilarious.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
5,jboothmillard,Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,8,9 March 2005,"This was Jim Carrey's first official role and launched his brilliant career. He stars as Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. ""He's the best there is. Actually, he's the only one there is."" The mascot of the Miami Dolphins ""Snowflake the Dolphin"" has been kidnapped. It is Ace's job to find this dolphin. He has help from Courney Cox (Arquette) and Sean Young who has a funny but sick story towards the end. There is also an appearance by legendary Miami Dolphin player Dan Marino (as himself). A hilarious film with wonderful slapstick and cuddly animals thrown in. The best part for me is seeing Ace being thrown about by a shark! Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls followed. Very good!",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
6,ccthemovieman-1,"Believe-It-Or-Not, This Was A Hit Movie",4,17 June 2007,"I actually saw this movie one and one-third times. The ""third"" was the second viewing where it hit me that this was going to go from ""fairly funny"" to ""incredibly stupid"" in one viewing, so why continue? This kind of lame-brain humor is tolerable one time, is all I am saying.Carrey is good at what he does, and he's far better than the script. I can enjoy moronic humor many times, but this takes it to another level! How I sat through this the first time makes me shake my head in wonder, except that I was with a friend at the theater so was a big Miami Dolphins fan and wanted to see how quarterback Dan Marino acted in here. The story revolves around the pro football team's dolphin mascot being stolen. ""Ace"" may be weird and a bit stupid, but he has a good heart and that's why he make a likable character.Carrey can be funny with the stupid characters he plays - which includes this film - but he also be extremely annoying and wear thin fast. This is a great example of that. It's also an example of crude humor insert into what - on the surface - looks to be a ""cute animal picture."" This is not a kids' film - certainly not appropriate. It isn't much an adult film, either, but it sure served Carrey well and it helped catapult him into stardom.Apparently, a lot of folks like this movie because it spawned a sequel. If you thought this film was bad, don't see the sequel. It makes this movie look like ""Citizen Kane.""",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
7,dbdumonteil,The animal lover,6,15 January 2005,"1994 was a beneficial year for Jim Carrey for three movies revealed him to the general public and lined his pockets: ""the Mask"", ""Dunb and Dumber"" and ""Ace Ventura"". At the level of quality, ""Ace Ventura"" finds itself between the two movies. It is better than the ""dumb"" movie made by the Farrelly brothers although it doesn't match the success of ""the Mask"". And precisely, in France, unlike the USA ""Ace Ventura"" was released after ""the Mask"" consequently to the commercial triumph of the latter and probably in order to arouse the public's interest for Jim Carrey. Having watched the hare-brained sequel, ""Ace Ventura: when nature calls"" (1995) before the present movie, I was able to compare the two movies and it is arguably the first one which is superior. Tom Shadyac isn't a renowned film-maker but in ""Ace Ventura"", he shows his ability in bringing a story to a successful conclusion while keeping an eye on his main actor's acting. The main difference with ""Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls"" lies in the fact that the detective story isn't too spoiled by Carrey's grimaces and his bombastic gestures. In another extent, the humor verges on bad taste, but fortunately, rarely. And there are some good gags without vulgarity which make honestly laugh.""Ace Ventura"" is more bearable and slightly higher the average of comedies in which Carrey acted. A last thing: if your favorite pet, one day goes missing, you've got someone to bring it back as fast as possible in your home.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
8,Quinoa1984,One of Carrey's best,9,15 April 2000,Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is classic comedy with rubberface Jim Carrey making his breakthrough performance to stardom.  His antics kept me rolling in the isles and have always given me a laugh when the film is on TV. Kudos to Carrey and everyone else who  worked on this film.,Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
9,sunwarrior13,Carrey Showcases Physical Comedy Skills,8,12 October 2012,"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is a comedy film starring Jim Carrey,who plays the title role. It was developed by the film's original writer, Jack Bernstein, and co-producer, Bob Israel. It co-stars Courteney Cox, Tone Lōc, Sean Young and former Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino.Ace Ventura is a low-rent private eye who specializes in recovering lost animals, so when Snowflake, the Miami Dolphins' aquatic mascot, is kidnapped, team representative Melissa Robinson puts Ace on the case. However, Snowflake isn't the only Miami Dolphin who has gone missing; several key members of the team also disappear, including quarterback Dan Marino, who is spirited away while filming a TV commercial. With the Super Bowl only two weeks away, will Ace be able to find Snowflake and the missing athletes in time to salvage the big game?Unlike famous bumbling sleuths such as Inspector Clouseau and Lt. Frank Drebin, there's no consistency to the ""Ace"" character, and the whole movie shifts in tone from social satire to sophomoric pranks and traditional cop show plotting.But nevertheless,this is a perfect platform for Jim Carrey to showcase his physical comedy skills.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

11,Theo Robertson,Is This A Family Comedy ?,2,9 October 2004,"You have to worry about how some producers market a movie . ACE VENTURA PET DETECTIVE is a case in point . It's about a detective who loves animals , he keeps all sorts of furry and feathered friends in his house and there's nothing more family friendly than a movie featuring lovely animals , you can just see the little ones begging mom and dad to take them to the cinema to see this movie . Just to hammer the point home the main plot centres around a dolphin mascot being kidnapped and there's nothing more heartbreaking to a family audience than a dolphin in peril So with got a set up and plot that Walt Disney would have been proud of and what do the producers do ? They decide to inject lots of crude humour into it . I was going to write "" Crude adult humour "" but it's not even sophisticated enough to reach the standards of adult . Are there any adults who think references to veneral disease are funny ? Will children get the in jokes to THE CRYING GAME ? I should hope not . Bizarrely the BBC decided to show this earlier today at a traditional family slot in the early evening which proves the BBC know as little about movies as the average Hollywood producer That's bad enough but what really disgusted me is that ACE VENTURA PET DETECTIVE turned Jim Carrey into a film star . Now that is unforgivable",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
12,Hey_Sweden,Still quite funny over 17 years later.,8,26 November 2011,"Jim Carrey hilariously mugs his way through his break through role in this screwy comedy / mystery that wouldn't be as memorable as it is without an actor of his intense energy. Jim plays the title role, a hip, macho, wild kind of guy written and played as basically a cartoon character come to life; it's no surprise that the character would eventually get an actual animated series. The mystery element is handled pretty seriously, and everybody else here basically plays the straight man (or woman, or whatever, as it were) to his in-your-face antics. Ace is hired by the Miami Dolphins football team to retrieve their purloined mascot, the beloved Snowflake; soon he must rescue star quarterback Dan Marino (playing himself) as well. Ace is set up very well right from the start, intentionally bashing the hell out of a package that he delivers to a big ugly bruiser (Randall ""Tex"" Cobb, in a priceless cameo) as a cover while he really intends to take the man's dog and return it to its rightful owner. Not all of Carrey's catch phrases may have caught on, but some of them (""Allllrighty then!"", ""Liiiike a glove!"", etc.) would quickly come to be quoted, particularly by kids who delighted in a character who goes so far as to ""talk out of his ass"" at one point. Some of Carrey's highlight sequences include his 'Mission: Impossible' spoof, which leads to the show stopping ""Do NOT go in there!"" moment, the send-up of ""The Crying Game"", the trip to the home of disgraced place kicker Ray Finkle (""I'm in Psycho Town, and Finkle's the mayor!""), and Ace's determined attempts to find one member of the Dolphins organization missing a stone from their championship ring. Carrey is surrounded by lots of familiar faces, with Courteney Cox, who had yet to achieve her greatest fame on 'Friends' at that time, Sean Young, truly a good sport considering the nature of her role, rap star Tone Loc, and Marino himself who is quite engaging and willingly makes fun of the whole Isotoner Gloves thing; rock solid character actors fill out supporting roles, such as Noble Willingham, Raynor Scheine (talk about a great name!), Troy Evans, Udo Kier, Frank Adonis, Tiny Ron, Bill Zuckert, Mark Margolis, John Capodice, and David Margulies. Alice Drummond deserves special mention for playing a sweet, loving, yet not-all- there mother who still finds the time to utter another of the movie's more show stopping lines, which you'll know when you hear it. Debuting movie director Tom Shadyac, who reworked Jack Bernstein's original screenplay with Carrey, is good at really keeping the pace going, managing to create great moments throughout. Originally intended as a less wild story, which had Rick Moranis attached to it, it became what it is today once Shadyac and Carrey got involved, and has created something of a brand name, with Carrey returning in one sequel, the aforementioned animated series, and a more recent direct to home video sequel with Josh Flitter playing Ace's son. True enough that it's crude, silly, and maybe too politically incorrect for some folks, but it still does today what it did 17 years ago, and that's consistently deliver the laughs. Eight out of 10.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
13,Calicodreamin,Not my style,4,19 August 2020,"Cringey humor coupled with a ridiculous storyline makes for a very long hour and a half. I could get where this is enjoyable if you like that kind of humor, but for me, most of it fell flat.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
14,Boba_Fett1138,The movie that launched Jim Carrey into orbit.,7,21 May 2008,"This is one crazy comedy that is totally being carried by Jim Carrey's performance.Sort of the problem with comedies though is its simple written story. It's as if the best writers don't want to touch the comedy genre with an 10-feet pole and they are above the genre, which is sort of understandable since comedies simply never have been amongst the most appreciated or high class movies. But than again on the other hand comedies also shouldn't ever be too complicated, or else they wouldn't be really comedies. But at least you should always trow in some originality. Basically the only thing that makes this movie truly original is Jim Carrey.You can say that this is really the movie that launched Carrey's comedy career. Shortly after this he got parts in movies such as ""Dumb & Dumber"", ""The Mask"" and ""The Truman Show"". It's as if director these days keep him more on a short leach but in this early movie from him there is no holding back and he goes totally over-the-top with his Ace Ventura character. This is perhaps also the very same reason why Ace Ventura has grown out into a well known comical character. It's really Carrey that makes this movie and its humor work out so well, since lets face it; the movie its script really doesn't provide the movie with that much comical material to work with. I really can't imaging how this movie would had been without Jim Carrey in it.The movie further more also has a good supporting cast with fine actors such as Courteney Cox, Sean Young, Udo Kier, Troy Evans, John Capodice and more.No it's not its directing or overall style that makes this really a special comedy to watch. It has a very typical style in directing, character treatment, it's music and other little things such as this. The '90's just wasn't the best decade for movies in terms of style and its way of film-making. You didn't really realized it at the time but looking back at it now, the '90's is perhaps the decade of movies with the least distinctive- and stylish style.Luckily Jim Carrey's presence compensates for basically everything. He makes the movie a real worthwhile one, although the eventual movie still is just not as classic as its main character is.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
15,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Typical Carrey comedy,7,10 August 2004,"I guess movies like this are the ones that established Jim Carrey, and secured him a good, long career. It's definitely one of the more easily remembered of his films, and one of those that made him known as the comical genius that he is. The script allows for plenty of facial expressions and sounds by Carrey, and he makes the most of every second that he's on-screen. He is the very center of most of the comedy, and that's exactly the way it should be in his movies. The plot is pretty good, it allows for many entertaining scenes, and the mystery in it is pretty good, too. The film is primarily carried by the comedy, but the plot is carried forward by the mystery, which isn't a bad idea at all. The acting is all fairly good, nothing spectacular, but not bad either. Carrey, of course, steals the show as the eccentric but smart pet detective, by the name of Ace Ventura. The characters are well-written, though admittedly not terribly deep. The film has a lot of crude jokes and gags, but they work well, as the same joke is rarely repeated, like it is in many other crude comedies(Scary Movie 2, various Adam Sandler films). The comedy is pretty good, very few jokes fall flat, and many gags will have you rolling around on the floor laughing, as well as Carrey's facial expressions and eccentric behavior throughout the film. All in all, a pretty good, typical Carrey comedy, but I guess it isn't anything special or unique. I recommend it to any fan of Jim Carrey, and fans of comedies in general. 7/10",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
16,neil-476,"Inspired, but the trend overstayed its welcome",8,19 April 2011,"If you look at Jim Carrey's career, he had been around for nearly 15 years before Ace Ventura came along, doing voice and small featured parts. Ace Ventura was his first solo lead. It was also the first opportunity for him to go into zaniness overdrive, mixing a wide variety of outrageousnesses into his performance - costume, dialogue, delivery, hair, body language, and face pulling (or ""gurning"" as we call it here in the UK).Credit where credit is due - it worked brilliantly. Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is an immensely entertaining film, and I am happy to recommend it highly. It has a decent story, and a bravura (and very funny) performance from Carrey.It put Carrey on the map. Not a bad thing. What it also did was make him the go-to guy for zany face-pulling parts. This worked a treat as far as The Mask (Carrey's immediate follow-up) was concerned: this was an even better vehicle for his brand of physical outrageousness. Dumb And Dumber followed, upping the ante even more.But then Carrey delivered a similarly mannered performance in Batman Forever, and it was the wrong performance in the wrong film. Three further movies followed cut from the same cloth, with diminishing returns (Liar, Liar wasn't bad). It wasn't until the straight role in The Truman Show that Carrey shook loose of the Ace Ventura legacy.Don't let that stop you seeing Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, though!",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
17,AaronCapenBanner,Finder Of Lost Pets,3,30 November 2013,"Jim Carrey became a comedy superstar with this big comedic hit that sees him star as wild(bordering on insane) pet detective Ace Ventura, who is called upon to locate the missing mascot of the Miami Dolphins Pro Football team. Along the way, Ace encounters many strange things and stranger suspects, when he isn't dodging angry pet kidnappers or hungry sharks... Carrey's broad(with a capital ""B"") comedy antics are an acquired taste, and though there are some undeniably funny bits, most of this is just idiotic and scatter-shot, if not downright stupid. Still, seeing Ace imitate ""Star Trek"" characters or using a plunger on his face may provide some fleeting laughs.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
18,Wuchakk,A laugh riot!,9,14 January 2016,"Released in 1994, ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" stars Jim Carrey as the titular detective investing the case of the Miami Dolphins' missing mascot. Courteney Cox plays Ace's girlfriend while Sean Young plays the chief of police who's at odds with Ventura. Dan Marino plays himself.I rank this with my all-time favorite movies simply because Jim Carrey's outrageous goofiness makes me laugh so much. And isn't that the ultimate purpose of a comedy? A great example is when Ace mimics speaking to a dolphin as he addresses snooping reporters. The second half isn't as funny, but it remains compelling as Ventura zeroes-in on the culprit. There are a couple of vulgar scenes that I could do without, but otherwise this is a great comedy where Carrey and the other filmmakers went all-out to entertain and succeeded with spades.The movie runs 86 minutes and was shot in Miami and Virginia Key, Florida.GRADE: A",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
19,Aaron1375,"Sometimes funny, sometimes awkward.",6,17 July 2007,"I prefer the sequel to this movie, however, it is noteworthy as it is the film that started Jim Carrey on the fast road of success. Still, I am surprised he made it after this flick. I think it is okay, and that the humor is funny for the most part, however, at times Carrey goes so over the top that it almost gets embarrassing to watch. Throw in the fact that Dan Marino is my favorite quarterback of all time and seeing him in this is also painful. Still, it has its moments as Ave Ventura is a pet detective as the title implies and gets wrapped up with a missing Dolphin, the team mascot of the Dolphins no doubt. So that is all there is to it, or is there more. Funny revelations and some surprising scenes near the end make this movie for me in the end as does Carrey's performance in parts of the film. If only he were not so over the top in some scenes this film would have rated a higher score from me. Still, it was neat watching my Dolphins go to the Super Bowl, a feat that only the movies seem capable of making happen these days.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
20,namashi_1,Jim Carrey At His Best!,9,10 September 2011,"Jim Carrey is a wonder actor. His performance in the box-office blockbuster 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective' is worth immense praise. The Golden-Globe Award Winner delivers hilariously in this slapstick-comedy, that is full of double-meaning jokes & over-the-top sequences. As a film, it works and manages some truly funny moments, but it's Carrey who makes this film a must watch.'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective': Synopsis: A goofy detective specializing in animals, goes in search of a missing dolphin mascot of a football team. 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective' is meant for those who like slapstick-comedies. This cult-classic is not meant for the pseudo intellectuals at all. Reason? The Over-The-Top sequences, and the unexpected digs at transsexuals, will surely not attract them. I, how-ever, had a good laugh and I mainly credit Carrey for it. He is fantastic as the Ace Ventura and in many ways, he immortalizes him. In terms of screenplay, there is not much to say, apart from the fact, that it is true to the genre it follows. Tom Shadyac's Direction captures Ace Ventura's journey, most convincingly. Cinematography, Editing, Art Design & Costume Design, are worth a mention.

How funny it was and that this was the true movie that kicked off Jim Carrey's career. So, naturally, being a fan of his, I figured despite some annoying trailers for this flick, I'd watch it. While it had some funny jokes, Jim was just actually as weird as it sounds, too hyper for my taste in this movie. I mean, don't get me wrong, I loved the ending and the humor played into the villain. I loved more than a few scenes, especially the first scene where Jim is kicking around the ""fragile"" box and him trying to catch the albino bird was also great. Over all, I mean, I thought it was a funny movie, just not my favorite Jim Carrey flick. I'd rather watch Liar Liar or The Mask.6/10",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

Just watching Carrey walk is so overacted. He purposely throws his legs into the air. And while things like this may seem stupid, it kind of fits the Ventura character.

23,sddavis63,Jim Carrey's First Big Role And His Fans Will Love It,6,27 August 2017,"You really need to be a fan of Jim Carrey and his rather unique style to truly love this movie. I confess that I'm not. Frankly, after a while, Carrey starts to grate on me with his antics and his over-acting. However, you do need to put this movie into the context of his entire career. This was his first leading role, so at this point no one was tired of him. It's a very short (well under 90 minutes) movie and there's nothing about it at all to be taken seriously. So actually, Carrey worked for me in this - or at the very least I didn't get tired of him. There were some things, mind you. The gag of him driving with his head stuck out the window to see because his windshield got smashed in (in literally the opening scenes of the movie) got tired quickly, and the scene in which he reacts to realizing that he had unknowingly kissed a man was way overdone. But for the most part this was an enjoyable, if completely stupid, movie.It focuses on the search for the Miami Dolphins mascot (Snowflake the dolphin) and quarterback Dan Marino - both kidnapped just days before the Super Bowl Game. Carrey, of course, plays Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (as the title tells us) and the whole story is about his frantic and even frenetic search for the two. It's funny at times. The cast (even Carrey at the time) is mostly what you'd call a B-list cast with no significant stars (although Sean Young had a reasonable profile, and Courtney Cox was just beginning her run on ""Friends."")The basic story doesn't really make any sense, which is fine because it's not supposed to. It's just supposed to be a silly little movie, and in that it succeeds. Personally, I can't give it higher than a 6, but fans of Jim Carrey will probably love it.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
24,FeastMode,my notes,6,26 June 2019,Strictly as a comedy this movie was very funny and Jim Carrey is amazing. Overall as a movie it is horrendous in so many ways. But I don't really care with dumb comedies like this as long as they make me laugh. Some of the jokes miss but most of them made me crack up (about 3 viewings),Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
25,ElMaruecan82,You'll laugh! You'll howl! You'll meow! You'll tweet ...,8,5 October 2012,"Coming from nowhere, a hand is grabbing his shoulder, and a voice says in a very ominous tone: ""Mr. Ventura?"" to which the character of the same name replies: ""Yes  (brief pause) Satan?"" The chances for such jokes to work only depend on the believability of its lead character even as a comical protagonist, but it's Jim Carrey who carries the film, and for some magical reason, he turns a very wacky script (in a simple-minded way) into a funny, and sometimes hilarious, comedy. Granted it's not the most elegant or sophisticated one, but I liked it, I liked it so much I could watch it again, and still laugh at the lousiest jokes.Now, that's still a tough review to give, because as much as I have the deepest respect for such distinguished critics as Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, it would be a lie if I said that I didn't laugh at ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"". They're right that the film had a kind of immature appeal and uses a character that plays the same one-note nerdy twisted geek all along; still, it made me laugh. Maybe it's the most primary and raunchy level of humor, maybe I shouldn't even be entitled to judge another film, let alone a comedy, if I was capable to appreciate Tom Shadyak's film. But I guess I would be more to blame if I was pretending not to love it just to look smart. Hell, I don't even know why I'm feeling sorry to love the film, I really do, and too bad some people couldn't laugh at it.""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" is so straightforward in its approach to comedy that it's nearly impossible to find it unfunny. Even when the jokes don't work and actually, I can't think of one (well, I didn't like the performance of the kidnapped athlete but never mind), you have Jim Carrey who saves the day by playing the most obnoxious cinematic character ever. Two things I don't get by the way: how could he ever get a Razzie nomination for his performance and how could Roger Ebert hate the character for what was his most defining characteristic? It's precisely because he was obnoxious that Ace Ventura was funny, think about it, a man who loves animals so much that he hates human. Does it make sense? What's the matter, as long as it makes laugh?And the opening scene of the couldn't have set the tone any better, Ventura carries a sort of fragile bag with such carelessness, any clairvoyant mind would automatically wonder if there is some fragile stuff inside or if it's just an undercover. The whole opening credits consists on showing him mistreating the little case, just in case we forgot that. Tom Shadyak, who directed ""Dumb and Dumber"" the same year, directs the film as if he was exaggeratedly taking his viewers for dumb people. But seriously, I don't mind having my intelligence insulted when it's done for humorous purpose, and when it starts being funny, it becomes most intelligent than any traditional gag. Let me explain this better: just because it's Jim Carrey, the movie can get away with everything. Really? Like he would ""Re-he-he-he- heaaaally?"" (And I laughed at that line, too)So, Ace enters the houses, gives the case and take the kidnapped dog back, the chase scene that follows is so over the top, especially when Ventura finally starts the car and screaming ""it's alive"", Shadyak gives the final deathblow to any expectation of a ""serious comedy"" and to the last skeptical minds, you have Ventura's award from the little dog's mistress. What can I say about this part? Well, Mel Brooks said once that ""The Producers"" 'rose below vulgarity', ""Ace Ventura"" is probably the comedy that comes the closest to that definition. Indeed, ""Ace Ventura"" belongs to a special kind of comedies, dumb enough to be funny, without being annoying, and smart enough to  nah, it's not that smart, or maybe it's smart in the way it's funny when it shouldn't normally be. Bad acting? Over-the-top situations? Don't ask me why but in the very context of Ace Ventura, they all work. The plot? The Miami football team's mascot, a dolphin, has been stolen and Ace Ventura must find it, he meets the beautiful Courteney Cox and two of them make a strange pair. We know how it would end between them but then again, it's handled in an over-the-top comical way. It's outrageous, raunchy, but how about when Jim Carrey is looking for one of the ex-football team champions, and has to check if they have a ring in their fingers. At one point, he's looking at one athlete in the toilet with a strange eye, and this is not even the funniest gag. There is one scene where he realized that one person he's just kissed isn't a woman and his reaction is priceless and for very gutsy when you think of it. Some would say it's homophobic but it mocks more the homophobic attitude than homosexuality. And if people can't get that, no wonder they would find the rest of the film unfunny.Dolphins, football, a cruel and tough but beautiful police inspector played by Sean Young, the beautiful Courteney Cox, and Jim Carrey teasing people, being nerdy, obnoxious, calling them ugly, talking with his ass, you almost have the feeling, it's a one-note performance, but it takes some great acting skills to carry one film alone like Carrey does. With ""The Mask"", ""Dumb and Dumber"" and ""Ace Ventura"" (all of them in the Top 10 highest-grossing films), 1994 was the breakthrough year of Jim Carrey, that launched his career and put him in the Hall of Fame of the greatest comedic performers. And you have to give credit to Jim Carrey, especially because he played three different characters  and he's just too damn funny.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
26,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A surprisingly dark and layered mystery runs underneath all the wacky comedy.,7,11 April 2018,"For all of Carrey's wacky antics and the, at times, overbearingly silly tone of the piece, there's actually a really dark, surprisingly layered mystery running through 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994)'. This isn't all that unusual for films starring the eccentric but sometimes unsettling star, though, as he tends to pick projects with somewhat of an underlayer to them. It is actually this rather accomplished piece of storytelling that cements the flick as one much better (despite some problematic moments later on) than the 'stupid, vulgar comedy' some critics have 'relegated' it to being. That said, the flick still is funny and the laughs are the primary focus, though here they aren't quite as intense or as cohesive with the concept as in some of Carrey's other work. We're asked to root for, and tolerate, an undeniably over-the-top and abrasive main character, and that can be difficult at times. It's certainly not impossible, however, and the flick is usually a good time throughout with plenty of laughs and a decent plot, to boot. 7/10",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

I thought that Jim Carrey was too weird for his part. Yes, he was funny, but some things go too far. Courtney Cox was amazing in this film, but that's about it. The plot was mediocre and the script was fairly weak. But, Cox and sometimes Carrey kept me watching this film. The best part of this film was the ending(a very good ending). My mouth dropped open when Lois Einhorn was actually Ray Finkle. Overall, this movie is sub par, but Carrey kicked off his career somewhat decent. This film is not as good as The Mask or Liar Liar.

30,CuriosityKilledShawn,"Funny, but lacking in plot",6,15 June 2000,"This is the movie that really kick-started the careers of Jim Carrey and, to a lesser extent, Courteney Cox although it is Carrey who makes this movie all his own by his wild and energetic performance as a half-insane Pet Detective. In case you're wondering that's a detective who tracks down missing animals. Ace is a great character, with his wacky clothes, groovy swagger, wild hair (LOVE that do) and unpredictable behaviour. He's a page right out of Howlin' Mad Murdock's biography.Courteney Cox plays a boss for the Miami Dolphins who hires Ace to find their missing cetacean mascot Snowflake. They can't play without having their mascot y' know. It's paper thin and despite lasting about 85 minutes, it is stretched too far.What could have been a half decent plot soon descends into lame-brain juvenile humor as Ace does his class clown bit, offends many people and uncovers stupid and unfunny 'plot' twists. Tom Shadyac tries his best to make the film look colorful and vivid and, for the most part, succeeds but sometimes the production design looks a bit shoddy and I have no idea who allowed Sean Young to be in this movie. She's a terrible actress and makes every scene damn painful to watch. However, she is quite a MILF these days. Not in this movie though.There are some funny scenes and easy to see why Carrey went on to become such a big star but compared to the rest of Carrey's career it's a bit of an insult to his talent. I prefer the sequel, even though Ace is a full blown lunatic in it and appears a tiny bit more normal and human in this one.A fun movie to watch once in a long while.

32,The-Sarkologist,Probably one of Jim Carey's more irritating movies,3,1 August 2011,"Many people swear by this movie; I swear at it. I do not particularly like this movie. It is crass, funny in parts, and in other parts down right disgusting (just as discovering Mr Winkle on Sean Young). This movie is about evil transvestites, homosexuality, jealousy, being a sore loser, refusing to take the blame for one's actions, and generally other things that I don't particularly want to watch. The mascot for the Miami Dolphins has been kidnapped and a secretary recommends a pet detective named Ace Ventura (Jim Carey) to solve the case. Ace discovers that somebody involved with the Dolphins kidnapped the dolphin and his trail leads to a player that missed a field goal and cost the Dolphins the grand final a few years back. This player has received a lot of hate mail from psychotic fans, and you start to feel sorry for him; that is until you learn that he blames somebody else. Thus he has created an elaborate ploy, in which he becomes a woman so as to get back at the Dolphins for his humiliating defeat. My main criticism about this movie is the character of Ace Ventura; I don't think that it suits the movie. In a way he is disgusting, the most horrid character Carey has played. Now I don't mind Jim Carey, his comedy style is a little over the top, but generally he is a reasonable actor. It is just that this movie really puts me off him. It seems that the character of Ace and the plot of the movie clash and doesn't work. The plot is not that important though because it is Carey's character that people come to see. This is not what I watch a movie for, and as such this causes problems with the movie itself. Adlibbing: Carey probably did a bit of this in the movie, and if done properly then it can come out well. I think ad libbed lines are best when the actor has the gift of doing it, and Carey probably has. Eddie Murphy is a dream at it, but then Murphy is one of my favourite comic actors. Carey on the other hand is reasonable. I think he has done some fine movie, but Ace Ventura is not one of them.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

35,zkonedog,Jim Carrey At His Comedic Peak,9,12 March 2017,"Much like ""Dumb and Dumber"", which actually was released in the same year as this film, ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" showcases the side-splitting humor of Jim Carrey at his comedic peak.Though the basic plot has Carrey's pet detective ""investigator"" on the trail of a missing dolphin, it is the crazy plot twists (much like ""Dumber"") that make this film so hilarious. From the opening credits, where delivering a simple package turns into an adventure, to the hunt for a missing Super Bowl ring, and finally to the hilarious jaunt through a mental institution (where Carrey must ""play"" a potential patient), pretty much every scene in the film will have you laughing out loud. Plus, with each viewing, you will find a different hilarious scene that you may have overlooked before.Of course, it truly is the physical comedy style of Carrey that puts this movie in my top-three comedies of all-time. Where some films just have to rely on good jokes to be funny, this one combines those great jokes with Carrey's ability to make every single scene an exercise in hilarity. The guy must have a face made out of rubber, as he can transform/contort it to meet every emotion known to mankind. On a few occasions, when the actual intended joke may fall flat, Carrey's facial/bodily reactions will still render it hilarious.Thus, this film is a must-own for pretty much everyone, but especially those who appreciate Carrey's style of comedy. Let's just say it will fit you ""like a glove"", while rendering the competition ""La-Hoo, Sa-Hers!""",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

38,Anonymous_Maxine,"Sure, this is cheeseball comedy, but Jim Carrey makes it memorable.",9,17 July 2001,"Ace Ventura is the kind of comedy that stems directly from a TV show, and in this case, that show was probably In Living Color, where Carrey got most of his publicity before he became famous as a movie actor. A quick look through Carrey's filmography will prove that Ace Ventura is the film that really acted as a springboard for his career. He had a few small roles in films previous to Ace Ventura, the largest of which was probably his role as one of the aliens in the awful film Earth Girls Are Easy, but after Ace Ventura, his career skyrocketed. The Mask (hey, he's still new, give the guy a break), Dumb & Dumber, a sequel to Ace Ventura, Liar Liar, The Cable Guy (oops), The Truman Show (ah, better), Man On The Moon, Me, Myself & Irene, The Grinch, and there's no end in sight.Sure, Ace Ventura does not compare to half of these movies, and is clearly more on the side of the bone-headed comedy that he was doing on In Living Color, but his talent is unmistakable. I first saw this movie when I was in high school, and I remember that I would ditch school and go to the theater to see it and I would laugh hysterically until my sides hurt every time I saw it. There's something about seeing a slob at a tremendously rich party who just doesn't care about the etiquette of the rich people. Did anyone not laugh when he was `testing' the food at Ron Kamp's I'm-the-richest-man-in-the-universe party and stuck his tongue out at that poor guy next to him? That whole scene at that party is classic!And, of course, it only gets better with Ace's dealings with Lois Einhorn. The whole crying game idea may have gone a little too far, but it was always amusing. Jim Carrey saves Ace Ventura from sinking to the totally brainless level of more recent crapfests as the Scary Movies, and even makes this into one of the better comedies of 1994. This is not the type of movie that is likely to win any awards, but you will remember the hilarious dialogue and Jim Carrey's immediately recognizable rubber-faced antics in this film that served as a spring board to his career, which later brought us many more excellent movies. Way to go, Jim.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
39,lisafordeay,Hilarious film that wouldn't be made today from funnyman Jim Carrey,6,11 August 2014,"Jim Carrey. This guy sure has a thing for making us all laugh. 1994 was the year he made alot of films from The Mask,Dumb & Dumber and of course this film Ace Ventura Pet Detective. As well as doing the screenplay for this film he also stars in it too. In this 1994 comedy he plays a guy named Ace Ventura(hence the title)who is a pet detective who is solving a mystery on the whereabouts of a dolphin named Snowflake who apparently gets abducted by some former American Footballer named Ray Finkle who is out to get revenge on Dan Morino(playing himself). So its up to Ace to solve the mystery and discover who was the culprit behind it. Meanwhile there is a new Lieutenant in charge at the police station named Lois Einhorn(played by Sean Young) who is a no nonsense chick who doesn't like Ace Ventura,BUT is she all she seems to be?Bottom line if you are a die hard fan of Jim Carrey's than this is for you,as there is a lot of slapstick humor going on in this film and also Jim Carrey making funny faces and acting like all daft and crazy throughout the film. Also stars a very young Courtney Cox as the love interest,this film is thoroughly entertaining stuff.If this film was made today it would get alot of hate due to the homophopic theme with the culprit being transgender and Ace making fun of the person at the very end. So if you support the LGBTQ community then this isn't for you,but if not then check it out.Overall its a 6.5/10 and out of 5 stars I give it 3.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
40,robert-temple-1,"'Wait five minutes, and if I'm not back, wait a little longer.'",10,19 August 2010,"This is one of those hilarious Jim Carrey films, where he plays an idiot savant. It comes so naturally to him, I worry. In fact, this was the film that launched a thousand laughs, followed the next year by its sequel, ACE VENTURA: WHEN NATURE CALLS (1995). It was not only Nature but audiences who called, and thus history was made. Would Jim Carrey by any chance be an exhibitionist? No, surely not! Not since the days of silent films has there been someone so outrageously funny who can make us laugh just by slightly altering his facial expression, and Jim Carrey really is one of those phenomena of Nature, like volcanoes, which keep going relentlessly. In this early work of his, there are so many excellent sight gags and so many brilliant lines that it is a comedy classic. We might describe Carrey as 'the man with four cheeks', due to his very rude habit of talking with his buttocks. But I suppose putting buttocks to good use like that is better than just sitting on them. He must be lovable because animals crowd round him, birds sit on him, pretty girls kiss him, squirrels and otters adore him, and we pay money to watch him being the smartest fool that ever was. His style goes back to the days of court jesters. In this film he is pitted against the intimidating Sean Young. Now as for Sean Young, we have there a true glamour gal. She was sensational in NO WAY OUT (1987) and countless other films. Here she has to play a tough cop who is suspected of being a man. If you can imagine Sean Young being a man, then you are ready to be taken away by the men in white coats. The scene where Jim Carrey strips her clothes off her intending to reveal a different anatomy than might be expected show us some of the reasons why Sean Young is so alluring, and they have nothing to do with being a guy. This film is so hilariously over the top that it is impossible to describe, just as Carrey himself is impossible to describe. No one who has never seen him can possibly imagine him. Courteney Cox does an excellent job of taking him seriously, as every Groucho needs a Marguerite Dumont, although in this case she is a delightful cutie rather than a matron. The film features real-life football quarterback Dan Marino playing himself, as the story concerns the Miami Dolphins, an American football team who breathe air while they swim round a large bowl known as the Super Bowl. Also playing himself is manic comic Carrey, bless his wobbling buttocks. This kind of crazed comedic insanity is something that only comes out of the good ole U. S. of A., the only country in the world that could ever produce a Jim Carrey (oops, I forgot, he is really Canadian, but Canadians are honorary Americans, aren't they?). I long to see him play a major Washington politician. Can you imagine letting him loose in the corridors of power? I recommend him for Secretary of State because that would sort out American foreign policy in no time.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

42,dee.reid,The Pet Detective is in!,10,19 February 2007,"Let it be known that Jim Carrey is a comic madman. He may not be the smartest cat on the stage, but there's no question that his act, especially in ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,"" is the real deal.Director Tom Shadyac saw fit to put the Man with the Rubber Face, later The Man on the Moon, in his own starring vehicle with this comedy hit from 1994. I've never laughed so hard in my life; that was from the first time I saw it. I saw ""Shaun of the Dead"" 10 years after Carrey's vehicle; that was another time when I laughed myself silly.Sure, the humor is immature from time to time. But that's part of Carrey's act, as the colorful gumshoe of the title, who takes on the case of retrieving the Miami Dolphins' prized mascot, Snowflake, after it's stolen from its tank one night. Of course, as the title would lead you to believe, Ace Ventura is no ordinary detective. ""I don't do humans,"" he asserts to us. His specialty is pets. It's hard out there for pet detectives, since it's a field that nobody takes too seriously, except Ace, that is. So when he gets the call for duty, he's all over the case.His investigation pairs him with Melissa Robinson (""Friends"" Courteney Cox), and the two uncover some startling details about the Miami team's history, and one of its most controversial players, who missed the field goal kick at the 1984 Super Bowl that would have won the game and blames Dan Marino for the whole thing. That player hasn't been seen since. Meanwhile, Ace runs afoul of Miami police department lieutenant Lois Einhorn (Sean Young), who seriously needs to take a chill pill and is hiding something more than just a gun under her skirt.""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" is a comic tour de force. Of course Carrey has done plenty of better things since this flick, but for commercial purposes, so let's just leave that in the future.

If you ask me, Einhorn (Sean Young) was sort of snobby. It's hard to explain why without spoiling anything. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, ""If you're going to see this movie, prepare to laugh until it hurts!""

46,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Aaaaaallllllrighty then,9,15 August 2016,"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective shouldn't really be as funny as it is. It's random, head scratching and just deeply juvenile, and happens to be one of the funniest films ever made. Why? Jim Carrey. The man is spun gold on camera, and he sells every outlandish minute of this gonzo Looney Toons goofball of a flick. It really wouldn't work without him. I mean, could you imagine, say, Dustin Hoffman, or John Travolta trying to pull of this kind of malarkey? OK, I did just laugh really hard picturing that, so it would be funny, but only in an embarrassing way. No, it had to be Carrey, and he's an engine of unbridled comic mania the entire way through. One acting technique involves basing your performance off of the mannerisms of an animal, and I've heard that he chose a cockatoo as the blueprint for Ace. The head bobs, squirrelly movements and that epic, instantly recognizable ocean crest of a hairdo. Makes sense, and I couldn't unsee it after hearing that. Ace is probably the most eccentric, beloved character Carrey has ever fashioned, and for good reason. He's like a cannon loaded with jokes, quips, pop culture references, personal space invading antics, a complete lack of inhibitions, a treasure trove of rubber faced muckery and a deep love for any and all creatures of the animal kingdom. Those are pretty much all of the qualities one should look for in a human being. I say that now, but I feel like after spending ten minutes with the guy I'd look for the nearest exit. Ace is on the case, when he's not goofing off, which is always. Somehow he finds time to search for the missing mascot of the Miami Dolphins, an actual dolphin named Snowflake. The story dimly unfolds in the background of all his tomfoolery, and includes Dan Marino, a suspicious billionaire (Udo Kier, whose exasperation at Carrey's behaviour looks very un-faked), and an ice queen of a Police Chief played by Sean Young, with an arc that goes to some pretty disturbing places for this kind of light fare. He also finds time to have hot jungle love with Courtney Cox, and speak to people through his asshole like a deranged Muppet, among many other things that will have you questioning why you're watching it, only to realize it's like your twentieth viewing and you have no plans to ever stop. It's Carrey's show, and he takes it into orbit, never letting the mania subside for a nanosecond. He's borderline certifiable, which comes in handy when he has to infiltrate a mental facility, because the guy halfway to belonging there anyway. There's just so many cherished little moments, mannerisms and scenes that don't ever get old, for those of us that love this character. Carrey shaped the landscape of comedy a lot during this portion of his career, and the mile markers that he released stand tall and undiminished to this day, bringing hilarity to all. The sequel is genius too, and one of those rare follow ups that is just as solid as the first.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

Now, he was the lead actor in a summer comedy that had no limits. To his advantage, Carrey took it and pushed it to the limit. It would be the film that launched his career into movie stardom.

49,Boyo-2,Flimsy excuse for Carrey's relentless mugging,4,26 August 2002,"Not exactly burdened with a subtle nature, is Jim Carrey?Here he carries a sledgehammer and a talking ass into every scene as his mugging becomes a contest between him, who can do it 24/7, and you, who might not be able to tolerate it that long.  Its all so continous that it comes as a shock when he actually says a line straight!He is given the task of finding the Miami Dolphins mascot, which happens to be a dolphin named Snowflake.  They need the mascot back because the Super Bowl is two days away, and the poor animal was taught some tricks to do at half-time.  The only real laughs come when Ace visits the local police station for some info and gets his chops busted by the cops who don't admire his chosen profession.  Not the overacting, they like that just fine, because it gave them a job in his movie.  They just don't respect a pet detective. 
Sean Young screws up virtually every single line she delivers.  I think she must have been determined to get a least one laugh so she tries too hard to upstage her manic leading man.  Not a chance!  He really does have to get not just a laugh, and will do anything to get it, but every laugh.
I did laugh a couple of times.  I really like Jim Carrey but he was stuck in his 'all-righty then' stage and maybe because I know how much he's grown as an actor, its a little distressing to know he had to do all that to get where he is now.  He COULD have been slightly more generous with everyone else in the movie.  Probably he's learned to be less selfish, too.
Lastly, casting Udo Kier as a Euro-trash millionaire is as original as casting Dan Marino as Dan Marino.  4/10.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
50,adamjohns-42575,Laces out!!!,6,8 February 2021,"As the film started I did cringe a bit and wonder if I would make it through the whole thing. It's been a long time since I saw it last and my sense of humour has changed somewhat, not to mention that I have to be in the mood for Jim Carey and only in a few films. I prefer his nephew Sean William Scott, who is hottttt!
I was glad then, when after about 15 minutes I found myself having a good giggle and remembering what had appealed to me before, when I had owned it on VHS, oh so many years gone by.It doesn't help your enjoyment when you're watching something and you have your very own Statler & Waldorf heckling from the cheap seats, especially when your Mother has laughed as hard as you at this film many times before too.It is a funny film, but it is definitely not for everyone as the type of humour could be grating. A lot of the pleasure I got from it I suppose was the nostalgia, but it does have its own amusing storyline and the lead character is a one off cult figure.It's actually quite a clever crime story, worthy of at least Jessica Fletcher if not the C.S.I. Miami team and the simpler way it's told through Ace makes it easy to follow.It was a shame that the version I watched had been so blatantly edited for afternoon TV. The censors ruin everything!Still a good giggle, but as with any crime film, once you know who it is, it loses its edge a bit. Like knowing that Bruce has been dead all along or that Kevin got the Kaiser name from the bottom of a coffee mug.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

I was never a massive fan of his zany personality but realize his humour, plus all of his facial contortions are pretty much unique. There are also some fine slapstick situations in 'Ace Ventura' and surprisingly some pretty dark jokes to. The latter aspect make it far less of a throw away movie and keeps it relatively fresh for future viewings. Apart from some pretty good gags, it does start to wane during the last 20 minutes. Still his many adoring fans will rate this as possibly his best ever performance.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
52,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,The Beginning of Jim Carrey's Career,10,6 December 2011,"When you go to see a comedy, most of us expect to see something so unusual that we will burst out laughing. Many times it's to the point of where you start getting cramps in your stomach. That's what I got when I first saw this film and I still do every time I watch it! Jim Carrey's first starring role as Ace Ventura: Pet Detective may seem obnoxious to some but to others, he is the definition of a living cartoon. Much of Carrey's humor is relied on body movements which does an excellent job at keeping the audience curious to what he really is doing.Although the character of Ace Ventura is quite rude; it's a kind rudeness because of his knowledge as a detective. There are so many parts of the film where people put down Ventura as a loser who really doesn't have an occupation because he IS the only pet detective. But he uses this to his advantage because he is also very smart aside from his wise cracks. For those people in the movie that chastise Ventura's actions, they are all proved wrong by his wit and reason.Director Tom Shadyac is brilliant for picking Carrey. It almost seems like Carrey was just told by Shadyac to ""do whatever you feel like doing on screen"". Everything looks genuine on film and nothing looks like it was really directed. This is good though because this is how Carrey's character worked. It focused more on impulse than directionality.Co-starring with Carrey is Courtney Cox. She acts her part out well too and of course because of Carrey's antics, Cox's character and many others are forced to always be a step behind. This is what makes Ace Ventura's character so effective. To think that Ace Ventura was written into the script as just a stupid character that has no idea of what he's doing would be a complete folly. Instead of a comedy having dumb fun, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective has smart fun.Ace Ventura: Pet Detective may seem silly, but it is packed with intelligent dialog and unforeseen humor that no one will ever experience until being introduced to this film. From funny motions to clever conversations, Jim Carrey lays on heavy slap-stick to create multiple laughs.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

For it to end up in a movie where Jim talks from his ass, that's the surprising part to me. It is a detective movie after all, and I appreciate that they kept it in mind.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
54,Kingslaay,Jim Carrey in his element,8,30 May 2017,"This was a very enjoyable film and a point where Jim Carrey brought a new and insane brand of comedy to the screen. Saying this film is funny is an understatement, Carrey hits it out of the park and introduces us to his crazy comedic style many of us love. His outright stupidity is done with such bravado and care that is almost an art. You can't stop laughing and are in for one hell of a ride. We enjoy a coherent mystery that would intrigue the viewer while also being treated to first class comedy. As a Pet detective he is too amusing as he sets about solving his crime. The beauty of Ace Ventura is he can make his quirkiness and stupidity seem intelligent. He is insane but also very good at what he does. Jim Carrey's comedy endears himself to the audience and makes his mark in comedy genre.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
55,PredragReviews,"""If I'm not back in 5 minutes, just wait longer.""",9,13 June 2016,"Jim Carrey's breakout role, Ace Ventura is one of the funniest films of the 1990s. Written by the former In Living Color writer himself, the film centers around an oddball kook of a lead character who investigates missing pets. If you enjoy Jim Carrey's brand of humor (and it's not for everyone), then you'll love Ace Ventura. On a personal level I find this film to be a true legendary performance, entertaining from start to finish. However, Jim is an acquired taste and not everyone will be amused with the childish antics.The plot is a cracking one involving him tracking down a kidnapped dolphin and has great chemistry with Courtney Cox and a great couple of scenes with beautiful Sean Young (until he learns her secret) which makes up a brilliant last half an hour and some of the funniest moments happen in the finale. Unlike some of his poorer films that used ad-hoc excuses to show Carrey's slapstick style, here his humor is cleverly deployed to enhance scenes within the story-line. His demonstration with the double glazed patio doors, his slow-play interpretation of a super-bowl move, these are things that very few people can do, and even fewer can do as amusingly. Watch out for former pro American Football player Dan Marino playing himself. A masterpiece comedy film and the start of a Hollywood genius's career.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

But because this was a sequel and because I already had seen ""Ace Venture: Pet Detective"" before and liked it back then, I decided to give it another try. And I must say, it may not be his best movie, but it sure was a lot better than the sequel...Ace Venture is the only existing pet detective and he's good at what he does. He's not only able to understand the criminal's mind, he also understands the animals. When a dolphin, the mascot of a football team, is stolen just before the Superbowl, Ace Ventura is put on the case. And despite the fact that everybody laughs with him, he's capable of finding out who would want to steal this dolphin and why...If you are looking for a subtle comedy, than you better don't start watching this movie. What you get in this movie is the typical Jim Carrey with the absurd humor and weird faces. A good story or a surprising ending? You'll not find it in this one. But when you just want to have some brainless fun, than this one certainly is worth a try. Even though not all the jokes made me laugh, I still had a good time with it. Especially with the man-eating shark, I was very amused.Even though this is far from a perfect movie, I must say that I've already seen much worse. It's not the best comedy ever, but it offers some decent fun and that's why I still give it a rating in between 6/10 and 6.5/10.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

Ace Ventura is far from perfect, but it is still great fun to watch and has plenty of over the top lunacy and laughs to please most comedy lovers.Sadly this is still one of Carrey's weaker movies, but for Carrey fans everywhere; this is worthy of recognition.6/10",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

60,Howlin Wolf,"If you like Carrey's manic brand of humour, you're golden.",9,13 May 2001,"This is without doubt a one man show.  Cast most other actors in the lead role and the movie may well have sunk without trace, but with Carrey as ""Ace"", you've got the makings of a comedy classic.  The humour is definitely not for everybody, and if you express your love for the film I guarantee that some people will think you nuts.  Nevertheless, if absurdity's your bag, you will almost certainly enjoy this.   Other actors fade into insignificance when confronted by Carrey's comic genius.  The one person who almost manages to keep pace with him is Sean Young, who displays a hitherto untapped flair for comedy in a VERY strange role.  Then again, the entire movie can be seen as 'strange'.  The football players also do well.  There is little attempt to make the 'plot' at all logical, but that hardly matters when you can't stop laughing.  Critical dissection of this film is totally inappropriate; you either love it or hate it.  Frankly, I love it. Kudos to Hollywood for putting money into such an odd idea and making the then-unknown Carrey into an international star.  This is a gem.

63,oneguyrambling,A funny film that lives and dies with your response to Carrey's antics.,7,27 December 2010,"In some ways Jim Carrey is like Will Ferrell, both came from skit based comedy shows where they played reasonably bit roles and were generally found to be quite funny in moderation.Both somehow managed to wangle that into starring roles and survived and thrived largely on their wacky antics to short term stardom. This is where their career paths diverged Ferrell still makes the same stupid film over, and over, and over again. ""Look! I'm Will Ferrell making fun of an occupation by playing it dead seriously and yelling a lot when the situation probably doesn't require it! Look! I make increasingly unfunny comments and get nearly nude a lot."" That's showing your range Will. Now go and invent some new ""ad-libs"" to crack the low IQs up when you spout them as you ""improvise"" on your next sh*tfest.Carrey branched out and did different things. (OK I admit that was just to allow me another cheap shot at Will Ferrell the most overrated ""Star"" in cinema today.) But for a while even while he was totally one-note and relying on his shtick to get laughs there was no denying it Carrey's shtick was good.Carrey has a pretty unique, look and is willing to make himself look stupid at the drop of a hat, a key advantage in comedy. He has exaggerated features, elastic limbs and an incredibly flexible face capable of seemingly everything short of turning itself inside out – and don't think he wouldn't have tried it for a laugh.Carrey can also come up with quotable one-liners and put downs with seemingly effortless ease.In Ace Ventura someone pointed the camera at him and said go nuts and he did just that. Without Carrey Ace Ventura 1 & 2 would've been lousy, he is an explosion of comedic elements, trying literally everything including talking out of his arse for a laugh, and as this was so new and different at the time most of it worked.Ace Ventura is a pet detective given the case of finding the mascot of the Miami Dolphins NFL team just days before they appear in the Superbowl. His search is aided by Dolphins staff member Courteney Cox and slowed down by Police Chief Sean Young, who it must be said looks very ordinary in this role (if this was deliberate it was genius).When the clues lead all the way towards NFL greats the situation becomes admittedly ludicrous, but in a pretty inspired and creatively daring way, much better than a ""silly"" comedy might ordinarily deserve.But the plot is merely a coathanger for Carrey to drape his improvisational genius on; a shoe to jam his awkward mannerisms and throwaway jokes into; a garage for him to drive his bit characters and random shrieks into I don't know where I'm going with this.Final Rating – 6.5 / 10.

Carrey makes it watchable - his energy and enthusiasm alone is enough to keep the viewer watching in spite of the inadequate storyline.I was surprised to learn that 'Ace Ventura' was released in the same year as Carrey's career best movie 'Dumb and Dumber' and there are certainly parallels between Lloyd and the pet detective.

Pictures came out with the funniest film of the decade, err, 1994, with the Jim Carrey super-vehicle, ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE.Right off the bat, it is a Jim Carrey showcase: chasing missing albino pigeons, rescuing a pampered shiatsu, and making high speed getaways, this all works because it is Ace Ventura, a hilarious, live-action cartoon character who spouts one-liners like an M-16.The premise of the film is that the Miami Dolphin's team mascot, Snowflake the dolphin, has been captured and needs to be found in time for the Super Bowl. Ace is hired and the sexy Courtney Cox is made his partner until the dolphin is recovered. With an assortment of funny situations like Ace falling into a great white shark tank (!), a montage of Ace searching for a missing jewel, Ace head banging in a CANNIBAL CORPSE concert, it's all gold, and as you have read, Ace is what drives this film into comedy genius! It was a busy and successful year for Jim Carrey, as he came out with another pair of comedy blockbusters, the LOOSELY translated Dark Horse comic THE MASK, and his hilarious buddy comedy with Jeff Daniels, DUMB and DUMBER.Thanks to Tom Shadyac for letting Carrey out of the bag and letting this damn funny Canadian strut his lanky stuff.It has some offensive, adult-oriented material, but if caught on television, this is nearly perfect family entertainment: as long as you don't mind your kids talking from their a$$es for the next couple months.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

Whether you love him or hate him you cannot deny his comic talent. In this 1994 crime comedy he plays a smart crazy pet detective who has the best catchphrases of any character, of any comedy, of any film, of anyone, ever.Opening with a delivery man kicking a package and destroying it with every step he takes and you feel as if you know this person and you simply have to love him for it. His character never slackens, always entertains and gets funnier with every scene. He is a comic master and he is this film.Carrey's performance does take the shine off a well written plot. The script is a great incentive for Ventura to be wacky and spontaneous.The pursuit of a missing dolphin is interesting, if not quite as intense as it should be. We see Ventura using his 'skill' and his 'charm' to give the older viewers plenty of laughs where the slapstick moments are undoubtedly aimed towards younger generations, however years on it is still as funny as when I was young. The sarcastic yet sophisticated undertones still remain classic.Flowing all the way through, this nineties comedy follows the mad detective in an intriguing investigation. There are lapses in the majority of modern comedies where the stereotypical hero has to redeem himself to find the answer and everything is super come the final piece but there are many twists and turns and a difference in the comic formulaic style here which gives the film a uniqueness that required Carrey's special touch. No clichés, stereotypes or cringing romance sequences that don't shine off the plot, unless you count the atrocious made for money sequel.The supporting cast are good enough to add some extra laughs but they are always standing in Carrey's superior shadow.Sharp, witty and exceptionally funny, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective justifies the genre and is worth watching whatever age you may be.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

Ace Ventura is one of the self-proclaimed successes of Jim Carey, but its only fans seem to be teenagers who confuse stupid and funny. The only reason I watched it was for Courtney Cox; I've had a crush on her since ""Misfits of Science."" Unfortunately, it's painful to watch her suffer through this movie dealing with Carey trying to prove to her why he's considered a comic. Truth be told, Carey does better drama than his flailing loose-limb antics, but he's no Robin Williams or Benny Hill when it comes to turning into a cartoon.

The movie is very funny. It will make you laugh throughout the entire movie or duration all because of ""Ace Ventura"". He's the main character. He's a pet detective. He finds and rescues missing animals. It's his expertise. I like his hair by the way. He also looks funny. He's unusual. The story is simple. The detective, Ace Ventura, is tasked to finding the missing mascot of a football team called the Miami Dolphins. The missing mascot is a dolphin. Can he find it? You need to see it in order to find out. It's important Ace finds it because the Miami Dolphins will be competing in the ""Super Bowl"" very soon. It's believed the dolphin has been kidnapped. Jim Carrey was perfect for the role as ""Ace Ventura"" the pet detective, and I don't think anyone else could've played it any better. I also like the other character called Lois Einhorn who is the counterpart to Ace Ventura. She's cruel and mean. She dislikes Ace Ventura. It was those two characters why the movie was enjoyable. Let's not forget the football player called Dan Marino who made a ""special"" appearance in the movie. There are many good parts to choose from, but the best part will have to be when they're at the apartment where one of the characters falls to his death. That part was hilarious! You have to see it. I just liked the way Ace Ventura investigated the whole thing. He's a genius! He made it look so easy. He owned everyone during that part. I liked it. Yes, he's a pet detective, but he'll also make a good real detective. Sadly! Ace Ventura is a joke to everyone at the police department. If you're looking for a movie where you just want to laugh, this is the movie for you. There also happens to be a sequel.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" is just that, Jim Carrey acting like a nut throughout the whole movie.  There are so many unforgettable lines and scenes in this movie that you can recite and have a good time with your buddies.If you haven't seen this movie, then you may not want to keep reading.  But if you have seen this movie, read on!The opening sequence to this film is probably the funniest opening sequence I've EVER seen in a movie.  I'll never forget how hard I laughed during the scene.  If you watch this opening sequence and don't at least chuckle a little, then you must have some serious problems!The only complaint I have about the movie is the ending, I thought it was just a bit too bizarre for me. And by this I mean (MAJOR SPOILER) that Einhorn IS Finkle!  That is just too weird for me, but it still is funny the way they explained it.If you get a chance watch the commentary on the DVD, it's got some really cool information in there.

83,policy134,A thin story saved by Carrey from back when he could do no wrong,4,25 March 2005,"Ace Ventura was actually only a direct-to-video release at the time The Mask was in theaters and therefore I would probably never have rented it if I hadn't seen ""The Mask"" first. Although Carrey gives it his all, I still think this is the lesser of the two. The storyline is so weak that it should have been just a series of Carrey's mannerisms which made the final cut. All the supporting players are just reciting lines. We don't feel they are at all interested in being in this movie, except maybe Sean Young. She has expressed her gratitude to Carrey for recommending her to play this rather tasteless character back when she was blacklisted by many directors and producers. Courtney Cox is just smiling and looking embarrassed and what can be said about Dan Marino other than thank god he didn't choose acting as a living.The whole plot about the Dolphin's mascot is boring. It could just as easily have been a missing kitten. The thing that keeps the film going is Carrey and he has a field day with catch phrases that would live long into the end of the 90's. It's also funny to think that he essentially started his career in movies as being the straight guy (eg. Once Bitten, Peggy Sue got married). If he hadn't been discovered in ""In Living Color"" he probably still would have played those roles. Like so many comedians he also tried out for Saturday Night Live and he probably would have risen to stardom much faster if he had been accepted there. But will we ever see him doing this kind of movie again? Very doubtful and that's not a big loss.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

88,CinematicInceptions,"Well, it could have been worse.",6,21 July 2018,"This movie would not fly in the 2010s and for good reason. The chief reason being that it has one of the most homophobic scenes I've ever seen when Ace freaks out about having kissed his transvestite boss. Another reason that it wouldn't fly today is that it just isn't that funny. The only time I remember laughing was during the montage of Ace tracking down all the Dolphins players. And, for better or for worse, Jim Carry now seems to be a name that does not draw crowds and may even repel them.
The movie itself is not exactly bad, but it's definitely bland, forgettable, and standard. Ace Ventura as a character is not a forgettable character, but the actual content of the movie is. The character, much like Jim Carry, is someone that I think most people could be entertained by, but the comedy that he is given is just LCD and not particularly funny.
I'm not going to say that you shouldn't watch this movie or that you should feel bad or uncultured or whatever if you like it. Maybe it's just not my cup of tea.

89,baileycrawly,It's Okay,6,15 March 2020,"It's been reported multiple times that Ace Ventura was made out of desperation on Jim's part. He already had an established and successful television career but he had yet to make his feature film breakthrough with an ever-ticking clock looming in the background. If he didn't make a movie soon, he would miss his prime window of relevance.
It's been reported (though not officially verified) that Carrey may not have been wholly satisfied with the script for Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. But he took the project on anyway, and with great success. It showcased his trademark zany antics in the form of a feature film and helped set in motion his catapult to superstardom, further cemented with the release of The Mask and Dumb and Dumber later that year.
Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is far from the crowning achievement of Jim's career, but it did for him exactly what he needed it to do, and for that the film can only be called a success. The result is a flawed piece of slapstick comedy, but it's slapstick that, in the hands of Jim Carrey, creates a product you can't help but love and admire.

If there were an Oscar for best acting in a comedy, Carrey would get it without a doubt in my mind. But hey, judge for yourself. A movie I'd recommend to anyone. Even if you don't like facial comedy you'll have to admit that it truly is a funny movie.The only downside to this one is a weak ending, but hey, is there a comedy without it?

It makes for often hilarious viewing: the vigour with which Carrey throws himself into his endless caricatures is freakishly fascinating to watch.Regardless of one's overall opinion of the inimitable Mr Carrey, what's undeniable is his uniqueness as a physical comedian - and nowhere are those talents given a freer reign than here.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

It proves that low-brow humor isn't dead, and you don't have to be ashamed of laughing at it. Like ""Home Alone,"" four years earlier it was slammed by the critics,and admired by the fans. Unlike ""Home Alone,"" none of the critics ever changed their minds. When I first saw it, I thought it may have had a few good laughs, but instead, the laughs never stopped. The scene where Ace catches a bullet in his teeth was a bit overblown, but then so was the rest of the movie, and it worked, so I'm not complaining. On the other hand, the sequel wasn't so hot, and the Saturday Morning Cartoon Spin-Off based on this comedy classic suffers from the same problems as most Saturday Morning Cartoons based on successful movies...endless repetition of notable catch-phrases.

And yet millions of people including myself and Jim Carrey still can't stop laughing. Clearly one of the hits of 1994, Jim Carrey gives a brilliant and funny performance that helped launch his superstar career. You have it Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) simply is the best there is. In fact, he's the only one there is! Pet Detective (Jim Carrey) ventures out to find the Miami Dolphins' missing mascot after it is kidnapped from team headquarters just a week before the Super Bowl, to worsen matters dolphin quarterback Dan Marino is abducted. Along the way the good and the bad happen first a meeting with dolphin secretary Melissa Robinson (Courteney Cox) leads to a blast-off bed moving romance! Great acting by Cox hey she's got talent. I must say that Courteney Cox is a great piece of eye candy! Literally speaking Courteney is my chocolate delight! Plus Ace goes eyeball to eyeball with a man-eating shark, and his investigation of the Miami Dolphins team simply woos everyone as the persistent search for the missing mascot continues with a clue that is linked to a missing AFC Championship Ring from 1984. Boy does the fun begin then all starting with Lieutenant Lois Einhorn (A.K.A. Ray Finkle), when Ace takes a trip to nearby Collier County to meet with Finkle's parents he discovers the revenge and hate Finkle had for Marino and the dolphins after missing that critical field goal in the Super Bowl. I must mention to all you researchers, archivists, and investigators that have interest in The Florida Skunk Ape which is said to actually roam the woods of Collier County never fear you should hire a professional that being Ace Ventura: Pet Detective! I know the movie may see or spell it Culler County, but they actually mean Collier county and I feel Collier is more suitable. I just felt that a Skunk Ape mention was a nice little note to add to my Pet Detective comment! Now finally Ventura learns the horrible truth that Einhorn is really Finkle and is also guilty of the kidnapping of both Marino and the dolphin. Can you believe Einhorn a man! Better late than never Marino and the dolphin mascot back for the second half of the Super Bowl! All great performances from Carrey, Cox, Sean Young, and Tone Loc. So if you haven't watched, please do but I'm sure your like the millions who have watched Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. Plenty of laughs plus enjoy the film that really made Jim Carrey a star.

As the name of the movie goes, Ace Ventura is a pet detective and an animal lover.Living in the house of a landlady who doesn’t really like pets, Ace has a way to hide them. The scene where he enters a seemingly peaceful house and invites all animals unto him is so neatly done and adorable. Ace gets down to serious business when he is hired to investigate a missing dolphin called Snowflake, a mascot of a local Miami Dolphins which is believed to have been kidnapped before the next Super Bowl match.Ace finds a piece of stone from rings the 1984 champions wore and stars to find his target from a picture of that winning team. After exhausting the list, the lone one left is Ray Finkle who missed to hit the winning kick years ago and was later thrown out. Ace tells Lieutenant Einhorn that it has to be Finkle who kidnapped Snowflake because the dolphin got the former’s jersey number 5 which did not amuse to the former footballer.While investigating Finkle’s past, his dog sits on the Finkle’s face with hair all over. Ace realizes that Einhorn is actually Finkle and that he kissed a man.

What we see then is what Jim Carrey has become. It shows Carrey carrying a UPS-type package down the street, destroying it with every step he takes.

Most of the first half of the film is full of immature humor, but I found as the movie went along, the laughs were actually earned, not products of toilet jokes. I found Dan Marino to be particularly funny in a cameo role, and as an Eagles fan, it was nice to see them finally make the Super Bowl, though it did remind me that this was indeed Hollywood. Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is a flawed comedy, but I liked it enough to not be too hard on it, especially with how funny the second half of the movie is when compared to the first half. It was like we were seeing the maturation process of Jim Carrey over the hour and a half that the movie lasts.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
116,ryangilmer007,Hillariously funny original (skip the sequel),7,13 July 2006,"""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" (1994) can be so funny and so silly that at least in my case we rewound the tape and placed it again and gut-belly laughed all the way threw it for a second time.Be wary though because eventually Jim Carrey and Ace Venture may ware on you. In my case the third time was not the charm and the movie was not funny and really hasn't been since. However, just for the history and the possibility of really deep laughs you should give Ace a shot.Maybe Jimbo will pull an Ace out of his sleeve and revive the character in the future as really the laughs stop here. The sequel should be skipped and really we shouldn't have hopes for any form of revival.Heck, the movie has Dan Marino in it and a pot shot at the Dolphins. So why not check it out.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
117,CrassActionHero,A Better Comedy,7,22 February 2007,"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994) Review: This is what made Jim Carrey a star. No surprises here. Ace Ventura is more than a comedy and let me tell you why.Ace Ventura is a pet detective who will not stop till he is done. We see Carrey's excellent and wacky charisma light up the screen. He indeed has a nice level of charm. What really helps this film is that it is intelligent. Hear me out, Ace, despite his comedic and witty attitude is rather smart. He gets hired on a case of a missing dolphin. He seems rather jovial, but is very bright. He is not a dumb ass comedy figure, he is a wise-cracking, clever detective. That gives this movie some depth. Ace is nobody's fool.Carrey is entertaining as Ace. We also get a good plot as well. This movie is a little smart. Many viewers may not notice due to the hilarity that is constant here, but this is a clever movie.One more thing, kudos to Cannibal Corpse for the cameo. Death Metal mayhem always helps.The Last Word: Good movie. It's no wonder Jim Carrey became a star after this. He has excellent comedic charisma. Get the popcorn and have fun.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

They like it, and call Jim Carrey the best. Any one can make a fool out of themselves. It isn't really that hard at all. Really, a movie that an actor makes a fool out of himself to make people laugh. Most any comedy now is just this. I really got out of this in my 20's. I do not see it really funny any more or Jim Carrey at all. Its just dumb, like the title Dumb and Dumber.Being dumb is actually not funny. You will never really grow up by being dumb, and people learn to be dumb, by watching these kind of movies, thinking it is the coolest thing to try what they do to make people laugh. OK, that really makes no sense at all, but people will do it. Might as well, go get plastered from drinking, and make people laugh too. That is exactly the same thing people do as Jim Carrey does.

120,Torgo_Approves,Jim Carrey is GOD!!,7,26 July 2006,"(r#45)There are so many reasons for why I loved the nineties as a decade for movies, and Jim Carrey is one of those reasons. He created so much fantastic comedy during his raging box office career 1994-1999, it was inevitable that his works from 2000 and onward would be a bit of a disappointment. Now I'm not saying Bruce Almighty, The Grinch, Lemony Snicket or Me, Myself and Irene were bad (far from it, in fact), but none of them can hold a candle to his absolutely ingenious stuff from the nineties, Liar Liar, The Mask, Dumb and Dumber, Batman Forever, and Cable Guy (yes, the Cable guy! You can smite me all you want!) Now I've finally seen the movie that jump-started Carrey's career, Ace Ventura. Ironically I saw almost all of his later comedies before this, which could have been bad. In some cases a comedian doesn't find his ground until he's made a few movies to ""warm up"". Not so with Carrey! This is arguably his best performance, and it gives him some of the most iconic lines of his entire career. ""Alriiiiighty then"", would seem like the most obvious mention, but there's also ""Looo-hoooo-ser"", ""Reeaaaa-lly"", ""If I'm not back in five minutes - just wait longer"", ""To capture ze dolphin you must zhink like ze dolphin!!"", and I'm sure a lot more which I've forgot at the moment.To put it bluntly, Ace Ventura is possibly the funniest movie you will ever see. And I mean it. Tom Shadyac, who also worked with Carrey on the box office smashes Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar, as well as Eddie Murphy's The Nutty Professor, knows what the audience wants to see (Hint: it's not extensive character development!), and makes sure that Jim is never off screen for too long, never wasting too much time on the plot (which is of course redundant in these sort of films). No, as much screen time as possible is devoted to Jim shouting, babbling, wailing, coughing, barking, quoting Star Trek and Frankenstein, talking out of his ass, breaking things, and creating as much havoc as possible to the dismay of the more normal characters around him. And damn does it pay off! Totally devoid of the cheesy Hollywood ""drama"" that plagued Liar Liar and Bruce Almighty, and without the pointless subplots in The Mask that no one cared about anyway, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is precisely what it should be: Pure, unadulterated Carrey madness from beginning to end!A definite must-see!",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

The performance put on by Jim, especially regarding his facial expressions, attitude, and voice, create this style of humor that was never executed to such perfection before now. The plot is fun and convoluted and even a little insensitive nowadays. I am not one for most pure comedy flicks but this one really got to me.

I believed that I wouldn't enjoy it. How stupid of me. Aside from the humor, there was actually a well-thought of plot!If you're seeking for a good comedy, be sure to watch this movie!

While it was a different plot, it felt like basically the same as many of his other films. A little raunchy, a dash of romance, and over the top acting. Truth be told, while this has been a character trope that he has perfected over the years, I feel that he had excelled in other tropes better such as in The Truman Show. Overall, not too bad of a comedy, but non of the jokes were gold, the romance underwhelming, and overall for this trope, others such as Me, Myself and Irene did it better.

125,chucknorrisfacts,Horrible movie!,1,18 December 2010,"I'm going to make this short and sweet: If you value your brain cells, don't watch ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective."" Maybe it's funny to little kids, or to highly immature adolescents, but it shouldn't be funny to any self-respecting adult.Jim Carrey acts like an absolute idiot the entire film, and it's very irritating to watch. I can't believe the movie got a sequel. That says a lot about society, and that fact scares me. This movie, and its sequel, pander to the lowest common denominator and that's a problem. There should be higher standards for what movies get the ""green light"" in Hollywood than this.I remember not liking this movie when I was a kid, and recently a friend asked me to watch it again, thinking I'd have a different opinion of it now. Well, nothing's changed. I still think the movie sucksand so should you! The plot is so stupid. Jim Carrey is a pet detective who gets called in to help investigate the disappearance of Miami Dolphins' mascot, Snowflake, a rare bottle-nosed dolphin. Come to find out that the individual responsible for stealing the dolphin is the police captain who just so happens to be a man dressed in drag, although played by a woman, who used to be a disgraced field goal kicker for the Miami Dolphins. What? What a waste of time! What an insult to the intelligence. I can't believe this is the movie that catapulted Jim Carrey to superstardom.That's not to say I have anything against Jim Carrey, I do like some of his movies, ""Liar, Liar"" in particular, but this movie just plain sucks. Do yourself a favor and avoid it like the flu. If you don't, you just might find yourself exhibiting similar symptomsnausea.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
126,xbrad68,Moon 168 Readback: Strive for porpoise crays polly mer,9,30 January 2006,"Ace Ventura Pet Detective is an amusing film. Actor Jim Carrey makes this movie work. A critic said that this movie did well at the box office because it was the only comedy in the theaters at a time when people needed a good laugh. Director Shadyac does a competent job especially with the shark tank scene. Ordinarily that kind of encounter would be scary but somehow the Ventura character makes it look humorous. In my cryptic title Cray is slang for supercomputers even though the Cray company is not around anymore and the NSA uses Japanese Yottaflop speed computers. Apparently there are porpoises on Moon 168 Artevan as well as primates. Wow thats a big moon when you you consider that some moons are only 6 miles in diameter. The Creators Moonfleet is impressive and I am glad to be the skipper of Moon 168. You'd be surprised how many meal variations you can make with wheat, corn, potatoes, and chickens for the Humans and leaves for the other primates on Moon 168. I am still trying to determine if there is a dairy on board although there probably is. The number of smaller spacecraft and missiles is apparently classified, but if you think that the Creator of Humans is in three galaxies, the Triangulum, Anromeda and the Milky Way Galaxies and has been around for tens of billions of years through big bangs and big crunches it is reasonable to assume that there is a lot of diversity to Moon 168. I think that the deer, wolves and dogs are on another moon in answer to an American Government question. Faq4HGlf.

128,T-ZER0,"Jim Carrey has some great moments, but the film can be skipped.",2,1 August 2019,"Ace Ventura was a movie that I heard had a big cult following, and if you like it, that's alright. You're entitled to your own opinion. When I first saw it, I thought it was a piece of garbage. Then I told myself, maybe you're being too hard on the film. So I convinced myself to see it again. It's not as bad as my first viewing, but it's still not a good film.I'll give credit to Jim Carrey. He does a great job of playing an eccentric Pet Detective. He quotes movies and has great facial expressions. The problem that the film has to me is the weak plot and lack of reality. For example, the Love Story in this film is so unrealistic. We expect Melissa Robinson to fall for the guy who littered nut shells on her desk, and now she's willing to go to his apartment to have graphic sex with him?Or a horny client of Ace offering to engage in sex with him just because he found her dog. I'm sorry, that wouldn't happen in real life.The whole Einhorn is a man thing I had a problem with too. I'm torn in two on this one. I'm giving it a negative, not because I'm against people of transgender, but the way it's portrayed is like it's very horrifying. Seeing that bulge in Einhorns underwear after Ace undressed her/him was way too much for me. I don't think my stomach could take much more.So I'm sorry. I can't bring myself to like this Jim Carrey movie. I'd rather watch the Mask or Mr. Popper's Penguins.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is just outrageously hilarious and Jim Carrey's tremendous performance as the so called ""goofy"" detective is just beyond words can describe. His constant sarcasm combined with his smart & quick wit and the outrageous shenanigans he's always putting himself in make the movie irresistibly amusing. Though the supporting cast didn't really hit their mark at delivering solid performances, Jim Carrey's undoubtedly amazing performance belittles the flaws and makes the film seem the best ever.

131,Snake-666,A fine example of Carrey at his zany best!,7,18 September 2003,"Following the kidnapping of Miami Dolphins' mascot `Snowflake' Melissa (Courteney Cox) hires Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) to track the dolphin down before Superbowl Sunday.The Nineties were generally good for Jim Carrey and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective' is a shining example of sheer Carrey hilarity! Jim Carrey plays his character with his typical, undoubtedly unrivalled, madcap charisma that has now become so famous throughout the world, yet this movie probably remains the greatest example of just how outlandish a Carrey movie can be. The plot is so thin that it becomes obvious that the story was made to suit Carrey's style rather than vice versa and surprisingly succeeds well. Carrey's extremely arrogant and oddball Ace Ventura' character is unexpectedly likeable and continuously places the viewer in a fit of hysterics with the increasingly wacky scenarios he finds himself in. Carrey's off the wall antics are what made this film and direct attention away well from the flaws that the movie has.It is safe to say that Carrey was the star and provided all the highlights of this movie and while Sean Young (playing Lt. Lois Einhorn) and Courteney Cox in some ways aided the movie they simply came off as bit-part characters rather than stars as Carrey stole the entire show. Capable direction from Tom Shadyac is a further high spot in this movie and recognition should also be given to Jack Bernstein who co-wrote an astoundingly funny script with Jim Carrey.Ace Ventura: Pet Detective' is certainly one of the finest comedies Jim Carrey has offered the world so far and despite missing the more heart-warming moments that later films such as Liar Liar' (1997) offered, is a good movie in it's own right. However, as humour is viewer dependant it would be unfair of me to say I recommend this movie to everyone. Those people who dislike many of the Jim Carrey movies will probably not enjoy this one and I can understand why some would condemn this movie as being puerile nonsense. Many of the jokes do border on bad taste and much of the movie has an atmosphere of schoolyard humour to it. I am aware that some people will not find Carrey's zany antics and silly noises funny at all. That being said I personally do enjoy this movie and feel that fans of Jim Carrey and many other people will find this entertaining fun. To sum up  I feel this is an enjoyable movie for teenagers, young adults and probably for the more open-minded older audience despite being somewhat childish and risqué. Not for everyone though.

Ace (Jim Carrey) who is a Pet Detective (good laugh right there) summons himself to become the one man army that will find the Miami Dolphins Mascot 'Snowflake' (who has been kidnapped) and bring the Dolphins kidnappers to justice (the Ace Ventura way of course!). Courtney Cox joins the ride as Venturas info booth and main squeeze throughout the film, while the rest of the characters (Even Tone Loc!) are subjected to be at the butt of Mr. Venturas slew of anarchanistic humor. Yes the assorted bits in the film are funny but after a couple viewings the humor and content therein tends to grow off of you rather than on to you. The wonderful Dan Marino makes a rare appearance as himself, and there is quite a unique twist in the plot towards the end of the film so don't say I didn't warn you! Definitely better installment than the second film 'When Nature Calls' but still it loses its funniness after a few viewings.

Five years older and wiser, I can see why it had them in such a state and why it still does nothing but annoy me: it's classic Carrey, all right, but it's not the Carrey that I've come to love as an actor. 
That isn't to say that Jim Carrey is not funny: he is dreadfully funny when properly directed and controlled.  The Farrely Brothers Dumb and Dumber was a hilarious film, and though it's jokes were only a few levels above Ace Ventura's, it certainly clicked better thanks to their direction.  Liar, Liar had me in hysterics, but only because Shadyac this time around exercised restraint over Carrey.Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is basically Jim Carrey's chance to go all-out and engage in whatever sophomoric act he wants to, the most infamous, of course, is talking out of his ass.  Certainly only for die-hard fans of Jim Carrey's brand of hijinks, this ultra-silly, thin-plotted, and gag-driven movie's only good point is that it gave Carrey his start.

135,Criticalstaff,The only redeeming element: Jim Carrey,7,25 December 2020,"I was a wee child when I saw this movie for the first time and I had never seen anything like it before. For my younger self this movie was the bomb. For adult me, it does not quite hold up as much.On the surface, the movie is a fun spin on the Film Noir detective genre. Even if we are more inclined to remember the more wacky scenes, I have always liked the more investigative segments. Like the one where Ace gets punched in the face in order to see if the ring has all its gems or how he demonstrates the victim could not have been heard from the inside of the apartment. It is definitively in a cartoonish tone, but it sorta plays in the same way a Hercule Poirot or Columbo reveal would.The movie is unabashedly dumb, but it has these tiny clever sparks, which makes it interesting for me. The movie is dumb, not in a bad way. It is in the same sense as Dumb and Dumber or any pre-2000 comedy. Because, it's geared towards (younger) children and it relies mainly on visual gags and of course Jim Carrey's goofy facial expressions. It borrows heavily from cartoons and there is an understated homage to pre-war Looney Tunes, very much like in The Mask. It doesn't really work, but it is rather unique. Yet, it is interesting to note that before the Apatow revolution, this what American comedies where. Where the plot and characters were secondary to the tone and the slapstick comedy.All this, puts the entire movie on Jim Carrey's shoulders. I like him, so therefore I enjoyed his antics, but if facial expressions are not you cup of tea: skip this movie. His performance is weirdly fascinating, and you're watching asking yourself what will he think of next. The sequence at the mental institution, where he mimics catching a football and then the slow-mo rewind is glorious!American comedies have that tendency to rely on quantity over quality. Throwing it all at the wall and see what sticks. One thing that absolutely does not ""stick"" anymore is the whole 3rd act's transphobia.This is bad for reasons too many to enumerate. I'll give three:
It comes out of nowhere, it was not established nor foreshardowed earlier. It really feels like an extra joke, a tacked on one.It has only minor consequences plot-wise, the lieutenant does nothing to stop the investigation, nor does the relationship with Ace have any impact.It is so mean-spirited that my empathy almost went to the antagonist: he was so shaken by a minor mistake that it made him question his sexual identity entirely.It does not take away too much from this film because the visual gags are its forte anyway. But, it is interesting to see what was acceptable in a mainstream comedy in the 90s. Thank God they also had Jim Carrey.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

Therefore, some people may not get the humour and discard the film and Carrey's performance.Get the humour or not, Carrey's fearlessness towards his roles in film has made him one of the most unique comedians of all time and he should be praised for that.I give this film 5/10 because although it was very funny, the story was very weak and the acting other than Carrey was very mediocre which brought the film down.I wont tell you any of the gags just watch it with a bunch of friends and enjoy yourself! 5/10",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
147,Xophianic,Fairly funny,6,6 February 2000,"I like Jim Carrey's later stuff. MAN ON THE MOON was good, LIAR LAIR was good, and apparently THE TRUMAN SHOW (never saw it) was good, but I didn't care so much for his early stuff. I think ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE was OK, but nothing great. It's certainly better than DUMB AND DUMBER, anyway.Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) is an eccentric detective who only takes cases about animals. When the Dolphins mascot is kidnapped a few days before the Superbowl, he comes in to investigate. Many of the police, including Lois Einhorn (Sean Young) don't approve of Ace Ventura, but he won't let them get to him. He also starts to fall in love with Dolphin employee Melissa Robinson (Courtney Cox).The plot is actually better than I would have expected in such a movie, which isn't too much. There are quite a few funny parts, but there are some jokes and gags that don't work. The acting is OK, even though Jim Carrey overacts way too much at this stage in his career. Courtney Cox, I think, did the best acting job in the movie.It's worth watching if on TV, but I wouldn't say it's worth buying or renting. Jim Carrey fans will, of course, love this movie and probably not MAN ON THE MOON. For me, it's the other way around.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
148,LeThAlWeApOn389,Funny,9,7 July 2003,Definitely one of the funniest movies of all time. Jim Carrey is the king of comedy. He was acting as a stupid person in this movie that it is impossible not to laugh. I laughed through out the whole movie. The plot was kind of stupid but the more stupid it is the funnier it will be. It was a great movie and I recommend it to all viewers who like comedies and like Jim Carrey because this was one of the best movies he has ever made.,Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
149,jason_13,The funniest movie i have ever seen-Jim Carrey,8,20 September 2005,Jim Carrey is my favorite comedy actor and i love almost all of his movies.This is Ace Ventura.WOW.Very funny movie.VERY VERY FUNNY.You will ask why do i like this movie so much.And also you will ask why do i think that this movie is that funny.First i will tell you the story of Ace Ventura.Jim Carrey is the eccentric detective Ace Ventura.The opening scene is very funny.Ace has to make a delivery to one man.This delivery is in box and Ace crashes this box almost everywhere.He reaches the place and the man comes out takes the box and his dog comes to see Ace.Ace catches the dog and hides it in his shirt and lets a false dog.He starts running and gets in the car and escapes from the tricked angry man.And about the story.A dolphin was stolen and the pet detective is called to solve this case.Watch the movie and you will laugh all the time.Really one of the funniest movies ever made. Carrey's funniest movie and he deserves admirations for the fact that he did this movie in 1994 when he shot 2 more movies.,Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
150,KingBrian1,Very Funny Film,7,25 May 2014,Jim Carrey works wonders in this movie. Less animals in this movie I am disappointed to say in a film that is supposed to be about animals. The movie was a huge hit in the 90's but as time goes by the humour has soured.Ace Ventura Pet Detective is a funny movie as you would expect from a comedy with Carrey in it. The story is about a missing Dolphin and how to rescue him from an evil Transgender. A movie that would probably annoy the hell out of PETA and the Politically Correct crowd.Despite the obvious laugh at the expense of those groups in society the movie is light hearted and what I would describe as silly. The film kind of appears like a Charlie Chaplin of the modern age. While Chaplin made fun of Hitler and authoritarian government Jim Carrey acts like an idiot on screen and we see him humiliating the Police Department the exact same way.,Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

Jim Carrey is classic in this, his best movie by far. I have never seen anything like it and probably won't again. It's fresh, the pace is good and the acting by Carrey is very funny.It's light, entertaining and no too serious which means you can tune in and out without really missing much.Everyone who has seen this has loved it and I can't see why you wouldn't.Pet detective 2 is also good but not a touch on this original.If you want a laugh and haven't seen this go and buy it now.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
152,eragonbookfan,Happy 20th Anniversary... NOT!,2,13 October 2014,"Did those who've written glowing reviews of Ace Ventura see the same movie I did? Jim Carrey has done some great movies, but this is not one of them. Look, I wanted to like this flick, I really did. But it&'s an astounding dumb film, and a complete waste of celluloid, IMO. Understand, ""nostalgic"" doesn't mean ""better"" - it just means you're more attached to it. It boggles my mind that Carrey is one of the highest paid actors out there. This movie, and the one he appeared in following it (""Dumb & Dumber""), are unbelievably awful & overrated. These films utilize slapstick/absurdest humor, as opposed to Carrey's running gag of distorted faces and talking out of his butt. Plus, him dressing up in a tutu is NOT FUNNY!Oftentimes I felt like saying, ""What the &%$#@? are you doing???"" The character of Ace Ventura is sure no ""ace"".Even if you liked Carrey's brand of humor, wouldn't it get old after 30 minutes or so??? My advice, go watch Jim Carrey's ""The Grinch"" - he plays a much more convincing & less annoying character than in this. The makeup he got to wear was REALLY well-done, and it was the first Jim Carrey movie I ever saw.But this film film was so cringe-worthy that the only reason I sat through it was to see how ridiculous it would get. The story as a whole was difficult to follow, due to Jim acting like a distracting fool most of the film. This movie is about evil transvestites, bad language, abuse for women, homosexuality, jealousy, being a sore loser, refusing to take the blame for one's actions, and generally other things that I particularly don't want to watch. Long story short, ""The Mask"" was the only ""good"" Jim Carrey film that came out in 1994.I'm all-round so glad I didn't grow up with this flick, because likely, I would've lost HALF OF MY BRAIN if I did! I just to have my memory erased for acknowledging it exists!Overall, this one is a real dud in my opinion, I give it 2/10",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

154,fullonrobotchubby,The Essence of Ace,8,15 August 2006,"There's something about the character of Ace Ventura I find appealing, and it's not Jim Carrey's over-the-top delivery which can be brilliant but, in all honesty, can also be trying a time or two. The root of Ventura's likability is his genuine affection and obligation to protect all animals - it's almost as if he's an animal himself born in a human being's body, using his super powers to help his innocent peers and making the sacrifice of dealing with other humans at the same time. Ace's services are needed when Snowflake, the dolphin mascot to the Miami Dolphins, is stolen from his tank before the Super Bowl (Snowflake is scheduled to perform for the halftime show). As long as he gets to work by his own social and professional rules, Ace proves to be a more effective detective than the rest of the investigation department. My favorite scene is when Ace goes undercover at a mental institution disguised as a nucking futs football fan; if this sequence doesn't capture the essence of Carrey's own brand of humor, I don't know what does. While the film has a pretty thin plot and its fair share of preposterous moments (bullet-catching teeth, talking butts, so forth), it proved to be an excellent vehicle to launch Carrey into superstardom. Some - no, many skeptics of Carrey were also created with Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, but he went on to have a long, illustrious, still continuing career. Sorry skeptics, but you have been had.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

Lots of funny things happen along the way. Definitely watch it, it's very funny!",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
156,ninjawaiter,"It's classic Jim Carey, which is either very good or very bad, depending on you",2,7 May 2020,"NO SPOILERS IN THIS PART
Obviously this film is for a lot of people, and I am simply not one of them. Everyone agrees it's stupid, but whether it's stupid hilarious or stupid annoying is going to depend entirely on you. If you've seen Jim Carey's other early comedies you can already predict whether you'll like this or not, because they're all just Jim Carey doing Jim Carey. Silly faces, silly poses, silly phrases, exaggerated movements - Jim Carey.SPOILERS BELOW
That having been said, this film is amusingly dated. Remember the mid-1990's, when literally every character could be utterly disgusted by the idea of a man living as a woman? (A gorgeous woman, at that. Sean Young is a stunner, arguably stealing the sex-appeal spotlight from Courtney Cox.) The lovable protagonist flips out in an extended scene where he burns his clothing and cries in the shower after having been kissed by her (and realizing her secret), and the entire police force and Dan Marino are spitting in horror (literally) at the final reveal. Perhaps more tellingly, the gender dysphoria/sex change is presented as a result of a severe mental breakdown and psychological problems. This film would never get made today, and if it did it would be protested and picketed into oblivion. How times change.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

That said, it still ain't a funny movie.This is kiddie humor but involves adult themes, mostly the sex part of it. Not something I would recommend for anyone above about fifteen years old to see.Still, it's a good ""tweener"" movie; not quite a teenager and a bit past a child. The story follows this guy called Ace Ventura who, as you might have guessed, is a pet detective. What does this mean? He solves cases dealing with pets. And he's the only one of his kind.When Snowflake, the Dolphins' mascot, is kidnapped, Ace is called in by Courtney Cox. He slowly solves the case while making stupid jokes.

161,paulmamak,This film is all about Jim Carrey's performance.,5,5 August 2007,"The theme of this film is creative, it stands alone in the genres of pert detectives. The overall storyline is quite poor though about the kidnapping of the Miami dolphin mascot by an ex-football washout in order to gain revenge, with a cameo appearance of Dan Marino. What this film is all about is Jim Carrey's portrayal as Ace Ventura, no one watches this film for any other reason.Jim Carreys is at his best for what he does in this film, despite the Razzie nomination. His overall energy keeps the film going with his loony appearance, humorous gags and quick wit. With some of the best catch phrases to emerge,at times though there was a little too much of this.The overall plot was very poor though, especially the outcome you find out that the ex-football player decides to have a sex change, take the place of the chief of police and do this all for revenge.

This movie has some of the best one-liners I've ever heard and one of the best comedians of all time in my opinion. That would be the one and only Jim Carrey. Jim Carrey has the funniest hair style I have ever seen. This movie has a good plot too. It has a real detective plot, but it's the mystery of a missing dolphin. This movie is hilarious though. The plot is basically this: Ace Ventura is detective for animals. He is very good at what he does. Meanwhile a rare dolphin is stolen during superbowl week. This dolphin by the name of Snowflake is the mascot for the Miami dolphins. Ace (Carrey) is hired to find the dolphin just in time for the superbowl. Other strange stuff happen during this time, but as you're watching this movie have a fun time laughing you're head off.

Only problem is that at times he acts very silly and it was more annoying than funny, but apart from that, hilarious movie. This is the movie that made Jim Carrey famous.

The storyline is silly, the dialog is silly and the concept is silly, with one extraordinary exception: Jim Carrey, who, in contrast, uses his extremely intelligent wit and hugely humorous body actions to make this movie what it is, hilarious.The fact is, this mans arguably a genius, he made a possibly average, run-of-the-mill, 'straight to TV' comedy into an all-time classic. You can switch your brain off and literally laugh yourself to tears watching the scenes in which he acts in. He CARRIES this movie, no doubt and his performance in this is extremely underrated. Being one of his first major roles and to actually manage to single-handedly make this movie what it is with his sheer brilliance at being a comedian-actor, well, it should not be overlooked.But of course, it has it's flaws. The fact is, the scenes without Carrey (Albeit, they're not many of them) really just shows this movie doesn't have much else going for it besides the man himself. Many of the other actors/actresses (Including Courtney Cox) just aren't funny. But this movie, in my opinion, deserves an 8, because it's just really showcasing Jim Carreys excellence.

This giving him the edge over the real police.Starting off by rescuing a stolen dog from a very angry man by posing as a courier right through to then end by rescuing the beloved mascot of an American Football team, a dolphin. Ace is pure comedy and still manages to win the heart of Melissa Robinson (Courteney Cox).My verdict - If you want to spend over an hour laughing your head off and in suspense then I fully recommend you watch Ace Ventura Pet Detective.

Some people (and critics) say that Carrey acts too goofy in this. Almost like a live action cartoon character. I would agree that he plays it over the top, but it works. It's not like ""Bruce Almighty"" where it seemed, at least to me, that Jim was trying too hard for the laughs. And in Bruce, it didn't work. I read the critic reviews and, of course, most of them didn't like it. But how can you not like a movie with great memorable scenes like Ace getting into a fight with a mascot or Ace sneaking around to the ""Mission Impossible"" theme. It's just good stuff. This movie also has a good supporting cast. It has a really good story as well. Most critics said that the plot was thin, but at a closer look you can see the complex plot. Lots of layers. Of course I'm exaggerating a bit, but to say that the plot's thin is an under statement. I mean there's a double kidnapping, murder, plot twist, it has it all. I know now I'm over selling it, but it's really a good movie. It's also the first time Jim Carrey and Tom Shadyac team up. They would go on later to do ""Liar Liar"" (which is another good Carrey movie) and, the movie mentioned earlier, ""Bruce Almighty"".

This is a really funny movie in which Jim Carrey gives a really good performance. His mannerisms, the way he speaks, and the way he acts in general is so funny that it never gets old every time I watch it. Everyone in this movie gives a really good performance and all have good characters. Jim Carrey and Courteney Cox have really good chemistry with each other, and he also plays off well with Sean Young. Tom Shadyac did a really good job directing this movie considering the fact this was his directorial debut. I also really like the script, which was written by Jack Bernstein, Tom Shadyac, and Jim Carrey. These guys knew how to make this funny, and they succeeded with the script. This movie is just fun in general, and a good spoof movie of detective movies. There are so many good things about this movie, and that mainly is from the talent of Jim Carrey, and it's crazy to think that Jim Carrey wasn't even the first choice for Ace Ventura. The filmmakers of the movie wanted Rick Moranis to play Ace Ventura, but Rick Moranis turned down the role. There were many other actors considered for Ace Ventura, but I think we can agree that Jim Carrey was the right choice for this role. My only problem with this movie is although Jim Carrey does give a good performance and is very funny, there are times where he can get annoying. Jim Carrey doesn't get super annoying, but there were times where I was kind of getting annoyed from him, but don't get me wrong, he is still so funny here. Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is a good and funny movie with great performances, great characters, good directing, a funny script, and multiple scenes where I just die laughing.

It's just so bad, and people are saying ""no it's not Jim Carrey, he did amazing"" no, honestly, it WAS him, because he was just too much here, and it's just not funny, it's stupid.

As well as Snowflake being kidnapped, Football star, Dan Marino is also kidnapped and therefore the police (who are against Ace) work on it. There are numerous hilarious scenes for example, i love it when Ace is trying to find out who's ring he found in Snowflake's tank and goes round harassing football stars- brilliant! Also at a rich guy's party when he almost gets eaten by a shark in a tank looking for snowflake and of course the part when he finds out that Ray Finkle, a fallen football star, kidnapped them both and goes to a mental asylum to find more info, he then finds that the police lieutenant Lois Einhorn, was a missing hiker. He finds the document with it on in Finkle's box at the asylum, how are they connected? This is simply great, I'm a huge fan of this and the sequel, but this is far,far better.

It isn't that original — Cherry Falls, for one, is based on a very similar premise — but it could have been a great psychological thriller if given center stage and developed properly. Instead, center stage is given to Jim Carrey, who redefines obnoxious and over-the-top. I don't even know what kind of audience the comedy portion is aimed at; it is obviously not for kids, but I can't imagine who else would find it even remotely funny (well, aside from the part where Jim Carrey fights a mascot at the end, that's pretty hilarious).

211,chrisbloggerg,Ace Ventura: I do not care,4,12 August 2021,"1.5/4
Ace Ventura is a private detective who specializes in finding lost animals. When Snowflake, a football team's aquatic mascot, goes missing, he is called to investigate.It appears to me that the only thing Ace Ventura excels in is in its comedy, mainly coming from the hilarious and energetic performance by the to-be superstar Jim Carrey. His character hilariously handles a delivery package (by kicking and throwing it), and he does ridiculous actions like using his bottom to make signs while saying, 'Can I 'ass' you a question?' that cracked me up a little.Besides the laughable scenes, the plot of Ace Ventura is relatively silly and dull for older audiences like me to appreciate. From a Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino's disappearance to a disgraced member of the football club named Ray Finkle to the main characters encircled by the police, I frequently found myself on the verge of dozing off. I felt that I was laughing inconsistently throughout the movie.The characters and their so-called 'relationships' suffer greatly too. I felt that there was rarely any chemistry between Carrey and Courteney Cox, which felt like they just met each other, and then they proceed to go to bed. We are bombarded by laughable dialogue like ""Listen, pet dick. How would you like me to make your life a living hell?""One more thing, Ace Ventura is a pet detective, right? He finds pets based on clues, right? Then why did we watch him in his apartment flooded with pets and no mention about it later on, and why were the clues involving mental hospitals, disgraced football members, apartments, and large pool tanks?Only Carrey's enthusiastic performance, peculiar faces, idiosyncratic actions, and charisma rescued Ace Ventura from becoming an absolute disaster. Please, I beg you, please do not watch Ace Ventura once you a gripped a sense of logic in movie watching.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

Its a simple story really, the Miami dolphins mascot (a dolphin) is stolen before the Super Bowl and Ace is hired to try and catch the crooks and rescue Snowflake (the dolphin).I saw this first when it came out in the cinema so I was quite young which meant some jokes I didn't quite get but still didn't take away from the fun. When I watched it several years later, it was great cause now I got all the jokes which made me even like it more.

The film has a decent enough plot, and delivers enough laughs to coincide with the running time. It is obvious that Jim Carrey carries the film from start to finish and that it looks like the film was composed for him. Jim Carrey is excellent as the flimsy bodied man, who has to retrieve lost pets, but the film could've avoided such tedious plot twists, namely one. The ending is very poor and doesn't live up to the liveliness that was contrived throughout the preponderance of the film.

217,2FLI,Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is better than you think...,10,26 October 2001,"Directed by: Tom Shadyac. Written by: Jack Bernstein, Jim Carrey, and Tom Shadyac. Starring: Jim Carrey. Co-Starring: Courtney Cox, Sean Young, Tone Loc and Dan Marino.Favorite line: ""If I'd been drinking out of the toilet I might have been killed.""*******WARNING: Possible spoilers ahead*******Believe it or not, but Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is one of the pinnacle movies of the 90s. It launched Jim Carrey's career and was the first ""gross-out/moron"" comedy to hit it big, both of which have went on to make millions. Personally, I can't even remember any hype when Ace came out in the theatres, but through strong word-of-mouth, we finally went and saw it in, I think, its fifth week of release. I had never laughed so hard in a theatre before (and wouldn't for another five years). Each scene was so off-the-wall and so outrageous you couldn't help but laugh. The movie was chalk-full of silly lines and catchphrases that they were just as funny when you repeated them later in similar situations (in fact I still say lines out of this movie when the situation presents itself). What's more, for those of us who were in the know and up until the sequel, Ace was a pop icon. At the time there was a uniqueness about this film, even after Dumb and Dumber and its more outrageous scenes came out later that year, Ace Ventura was still the fan favorite because it was the first and (still is) the most genuine.Plot/Story: The plot is paper thin. This is usually a bad thing, but making something complex out of a movie like this would have been counterproductive and could very easily have ruined it. The plot serves as a central point to keep the movie going, while still allowing Carrey run rampant all over the screen. Unlike most of the copycats since, you didn't have to believe something like Dan Marino and Snowflake could (or would) be kidnapped two weeks before the Super Bowl. Shadyac and Carrey weren't trying to insult your intelligence, they were trying to entertain you and in that respect the plot served its purpose.Acting: You wanna know why Carrey made $20 million for his movies? Because he nailed his character here and you couldn't have asked for a better performance from anyone. That said, the only other notable performance came from Tone Loc (of all people), as Emilio. Sean Young and Courtney Cox did what they needed too, but they didn't do anything I couldn't do. Dan Marino was acting as ""himself,"" and while it's funny to watch, the reality is he sucked... unless of course he was supposed to look like he sucked in which case he was brilliant. Just kidding, he sucked, otherwise Hollywood would have been kicking his door down.Characters: Because of its genre, this category is often overlooked, but THIS is what really made the movie for me, the characters. As outrageous as many of them were, I've always had a feeling that these were realistic portrayals. I know that sounds crazy, but tell me after watching Ace destroy the UPS package in the beginning of the movie, that everything he did after that seemed normal for him. Sure the stuff he did was nuts, and it likely shocked you, but that was Ace and that's how he did things. What really worked, though, is this: out of all the ""moron"" films since, how many of the morons were just misunderstood geniuses? None, not a damn one, that's why Ace was fun and the movie was great, because he wasn't stupid, just strange. Everyone in the movie was a character, even Dan Marino who was playing ""himself."" The reason a lot of the characters worked was because they were all extensions of the real person playing them (although I doubt Sean Young was ever a man...). You don't notice that in most films... it was as though Bernstein wrote each character to fit the actor.Effects/Setting: Seeing scenes of Miami for two hours is never a bad thing, I can't think of a better place. The sun was always out, keeping the film light and upbeat. There's not much else to say, the location was a perfect fit with the movie's misfit style.Score/Soundtrack: Same deal as the setting, it worked because there wasn't anything wrong with it. The Mission: Impossible theme and ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"" spoofs were great fun. These two categories are what typically do ""it"" for other films, but Ace Ventura's tech people did their jobs and got out of Carrey's way.Many will say out of all the movies in 1994, why did you pick Ace Ventura, what was wrong Forest Gump or The Lion King or Pulp Fiction? They were critically acclaimed and audiences loved them. My answer is they were no fun. Forest Gump is touching, but hardly stacks against the real tearjerkers, The Lion King is not Aladdin and never will be, and Pulp Fiction makes my head hurt, I still don't get the purpose of not knowing what's going on for two hours until the very end. P*** on all that, audiences clamored to see those because they were supposed too. If you ever get a chance to read the reviews on Ace you'll hear the critics complain about the sexual innuendos and the toilet humor, yet you'll notice the film was rated PG. By today's standards (like There's Something About Mary which, ironically, got great reviews), Ace Ventura is tame, hell the only thing Ace had in his hair was gel... I may not seem grown up for liking this film, but so what, a true intellectual doesn't watch movies, he reads books.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

The story is also not child friendly as in the opening scene there is a oral sex joke and there is s sprinkling of adult humor throughout the movie. Cringe alert.

Jim Carrey maintains his humorous, perverted, rubbery face self, with this movie highlighting all of it to full extent.So basically, this movie features the amazing Jim Carrey as an extremely sassy pet detective (a person who finds People's animals and pets) with super hair and a Hawaiian shirt. Extremely promising beginning and a blast of laughs the whole way through. It gives you the ""the character's a jerk, but I'll still root for him because he's awesome"" feeling because throughout the film he does upset quite a number of people, but makes even more people, including you and I happy and full of laughs.Many find this movie to be a classic cheesy football comedy, and technically it is, but it is packed with stupid jokes we all need once in a while, it's like a classic version of iFunny in a movie, very entertaining. Personally I've seen it a dozen times and whether I get a lousy grade or a close family member dies, it can always knock 1 hr 26 mins of sadness outta my day, and provide me with unlimited laughs after wards and also at all time (even if we're trying to take a test and I do burst out in laughter for no absolute reason at all) WARNING: I'm still stuck replying ""alrighty then"" to everything, but it truly is worth the watch multiple times, a very fun group movie for a small party with friends to a fancy business movie party. Maybe it's just because I'm a Carrey fan, but I think it's quite a masterpiece.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

228,OwainBevan,Carrey makes it big with a comedy classic.,8,9 September 2007,"Jim Carrey's trademark manic comic style was implemented brilliantly in his first big screen hit. One of my favourite films of the nineties, Carrey is allowed to shine thanks to an excellent script by Jack Bernstein; Tom Shadyac, a director who knows how to control Carrey's talent and superb supporting performances from Courtney Cox and Sean Young. None of which Carrey had in the lamentable sequel 'Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls'. Carrey's character, the eponymous Ace Ventura, works as 'pet detective' (finding lost pets) and is employed to find the dolphin mascot of the Miami Dolphins football team after it is kidnapped. Ace is portrayed as a kind of zany Doctor Dolittle who is far better at dealing with animals than people. In the words of Ace himself: ""I don't do humans"". The movie doesn't get too deep in terms of plot or character; it is principally concerned with arranging comic set-pieces for Carrey to strut his stuff. The pace of the movie never lets up with scene after scene almost tailor-made to show off Carrey's comic abilities. Though I personally don't think this is Carrey's best work, thirteen years later, this movie is just as funny as it ever was. Owain Bevan",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

231,FireSpirit13,My take on this Classic,5,23 February 2006,"Jim Carrey stars in possibly his first biggest break right after ""In Living Color"" (Also a GOOD series!) And, doesn't disappoint!For those of you who haven't seen Pre-""The Mask"" Jim Carrey, I can Highly recommend this and ""When Nature Calls"" If only for Archival or fan-love of Carrey's crazy, erratic comedy!Also, If you still haven't had your fill of psychotically funny behavior, I can also recommend Some of Kevin Smith's awesome flicks, unless your into censorship or totally into anti-realistic comedy, you should see a few of his hilarious movies, or ""Clerks""Or, if you're into squeaky-clean comedy, I can recommend ""The Pacifier"", but if you hate violence.....then too bad!",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
232,Lassi-4,I don´t like Jim Carrey (in this picture).,1,11 January 1999,"I don´t like Jim Carrey and his acting. His facial expressions and gestures are funny, but just when seen the first time. Who wants to watch a picture of lunatic man longer than ten minutes? The story is also very silly. I suppose this movie was made for five-year-old kids. Then it serves its purposes better. The only good thing in this movie is Courteney Cox who could maybe become a big star. In my opinion, Jim Carrey's career can´t last a long time if he keeps on making movies like this.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

238,metalarmr,Silly but Fun,8,5 January 2011,"Wow, this movie came out in 1994. I saw this when it came out and I was 8 years old. Even at that time I understood the silly/adult humour. This movie is far greater than When Nature Calls.Again, this movie in my opinion was Jim Carrey when he was fresh. His oogly googaly faces were still new to me and the world ( I think the Mask was prior to this movie). This movie is like I stated silly but fun. It has a very interesting case for which Jim needs to unravel. I thought it was well planned out. I especially liked Einhorns character. She's a great villain.While it is a detective-esquire film it doesn't take itself too serious. It leaves you with just enough curiosity to stick around and see what happens next and Jim's character keeps you enticed. It has some action scenes but not like James Bond or the Die Hard series. It has suspense but its not too overbearing that makes you scratch your head. Its a friendly middle of the road filmIs it made for kids to watch? Not to sure, but regardless its a movie to put on for the laughs and such.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
239,cburby79,Good flick!,8,20 February 2012,"Sure, Ace Ventura does not compare to half of these movies, and is clearly more on the side of the bone-headed comedy that he was doing on In Living Color, but his talent is unmistakable. I first saw this movie when I was in high school, and I remember that I would ditch school and go to the theater to see it and I would laugh hysterically until my sides hurt every time I saw it. There's something about seeing a slob at a tremendously rich party who just doesn't care about the etiquette of the rich people. Did anyone not laugh when he was 'testing' the food at Ron Kamp's I'm-the-richest-man-in-the-universe party and stuck his tongue out at that poor guy next to him? That whole scene at that party is classic! And, of course, it only gets better with Ace's dealings with Lois Einhorn. The whole crying game idea may have gone a little too far, but it was always amusing. Jim Carrey saves Ace Ventura from sinking to the totally brainless level of more recent crapfests as the Scary Movies, and even makes this into one of the better comedies of 1994. This is not the type of movie that is likely to win any awards, but you will remember the hilarious dialogue and Jim Carrey's immediately recognizable rubber-faced antics in this film that served as a spring board to his career, which later brought us many more excellent movies. Way to go, Jim.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
240,mohammed-hassan-324-46026,Very funny!,7,24 March 2012,"Undeniably juvenile, but funny and entertaining comedy stars Carrey—in his breakthrough role—as a goofy, wildly eccentric pet detective hired to find the missing Miami Dolphins mascot. He's the right man for the job but his childish idiosyncrasies, uncanny bond with animals, and aberrant investigative techniques cause outsiders to question whether or not he can actually make good on his word. Aimed mostly at fans who really enjoy silly humor, others will probably find it lame and tiresome. There are some amusing cameos by real Dolphin football players (including an engaging Dan Marino) but this film belongs to Carrey and his constant outrageousness. Sure-fire entertainment for fans of this genre. **½",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
241,wereallmadhere,One of my favourite movies,9,26 February 2005,"Very rarely do you come across a movie you can watch over and over again without having it lose any of its greatness. With this film, it was one of only 2 I've had on VHS (Rest In Peace, dear friend) where the tape actually wiped from over playing (the other being Batman, with Michael Keaton, the bestest Batman of them all).Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is Jim Carrey's best piece of comedic work. It's is soooo funny, my favourite scene is the one in the mental institution! Followed by the scene after he finds out Lois Einhorn is Ray Finkle he's crying in the shower and he burns his clothes and makes himself puke in the toilet...great stuff.I think Jim really proved he's more than your average comedian!!!",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

Yes he was on ""In Living Color"", but this where people began to take notice of him. JIm started his career off with a bang, with not only this, but two other movies that followed: The Mask and then Dumb & Dumber. What made this movie work was Jim and the way his costars worked off of him: Courteney Cox, Sean Young and Dan Marino. Cox has stated in past interviews that she had a great time working with Jim. In fact, Cox was one of the reasons her ""Friends"" co-star Jennifer Aniston decided to sign on to Bruce Almighty. Look at how Sean and Dan worked off of Jim.

246,tammylewis-31606,A 1994 Classic,8,13 December 2020,"Have you ever seen Sherlock Holmes? Well this movie basically summed up what it is about. In the film, Jim Carry, who is probably most famous for In Living Colour before he became a serious actor. Jim Carry takes the role of Ace Ventura, a pet detective. The Miami dolphins dolphin goes missing and Ace is on the case.Probably the funniest scene in this whole movie is the last half hour. We find out that Louis Ieinhorn, is really quarterback Ray Finkle in disguise. The way Ace finds out is also pretty comical. But the way the rest of the cast figures it out is where the movie really shines. Ace tries to prove that she is really a man. The way he deals with it is to strip her down to prove she has male anatomy. Once we do find out that's pretty much the case solved.There are more comical scenes in this movie, but didn't make me laugh as hard. Ace Ventura seems like a character who tries to do well but ends up flat on his face. I also enjoyed Dumb and Dumber the same year with its stupid humour. This film is a classic and a hilarious one too. But do me a favour. Don't watch the sequel. 13/12/2020",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

When it first came to video my siblings and I watched it so many times that the tape wore out.The real surprise, though, was putting the film in a couple of weekends ago for the first time in years. It is still hilarious. I laughed just as hard as I did when I was eleven. I also got a lot more of the humor. It is stupid, but dang it, it is funny. Carrey is a genius. The physical comedy in this movie is outstanding, stuff like Carrey dancing around in a tootoo and hiding in a box. Classic.With films like the Majestic and the Truman Show demonstrating Carrey's impressive and worthy dramatic talent, it was refreshing to look back at where he got his start. I don't care if he ever gets an Oscar, the best performances of Jim Carrey's career were Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and Dumb and Dumber.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
249,TeddyBare,An absolute classic,10,9 February 2003,"Jim Carrey goes all out in this fabulous first movie in the long line of AV endorsed cartoons, toys and even the sequel (which isn't quite as good as this, but still great!). Ace is a Pet Detective, on the run (he doesn't even have a gun!) but still manages to capture the villain every time. Courteney Cox is brilliant in this as Melissa who assists him as, if memory serves, a police agent who's also looking for the dolphin. Great movie and a great cast!",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
250,TheEye5000,One of Carrey's best.,10,13 February 2005,"First of all, I would like to issue this warning: This movie is not for everybody (especially if you were raised with morals).Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) is a self-described ""pet detective"" who works to return stolen animals in a variety of bizarre and unorthodox methods. In this case, he gets hired by the Miami Dolphins to find their kidnapped mascot, Snowflake. Ace quickly delves into the case and from here, all sanity and decency go south.I originally saw this movie as a little kid and laughed my ass off. I saw it again as a teenager and I laughed even harder.Most of the humor here is crude and obnoxious, though not in the teenage ""American Pie-esquire"" way. Carrey, with his uniquely entertaining sense of humor, performs in various eccentric and somewhat disturbing scenes that most actors probably would refuse out of dignity (In one scene for example, Carrey portrays a mentally disturbed football player, complete with slow-motion ""instant-replay"" moves. In another, he demands information from a cop. When his request is refused, he proceeds to literally ""ass"" a few questions until the cop finally concedes out of annoyance). Though there is little plot to the movie, the jokes are probably enough to keep you entertained.Perhaps the only downside to this film is the rather mediocre performances of the supporting characters (with the exception of Sean Young, who employs a stern, cold, and unemotional foil to Carrey's laid-back, comical lunacy). But of course, Ace Ventura is a rather big character so I guess that it was better this way to make him the only spotlight.Also, for any death metal fans out there, Cannibal Corpse (who are apparently Jim Carrey's favorite band) also make a short (and hilarious) cameo in this movie.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
251,davich86,Aaaaaaaaaaalriiiiiiiighty Then!!!!!!,10,20 May 2005,"I'm guessing that everybody knows the story of this movie by now, but for those who might not have had the opportunity to see this great movie, it's quite a simple formula. The Miami Dolphins mascot is stolen and by word-of-mouth advertising Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) is called into manic action. His job is to find the dolphin and return it before The Miami Dolphins' crucial game.Jim Carrey is quite simply amazing, I never stopped laughing the whole way through the movie. This is surely Carrey's best work, even now. OK, Dumb and Dumber and The Mask are very funny movies too, but this takes the biscuit. Everything Ace does made me laugh, from whipping football player's with a towel to get a ring imprint to showing up at a mansion party and being his usual manic self.100 laughs per hour, if you have a sense of humour, then this movie is for you!!!",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
252,windusc96,"Almost a ""Jim Carrey"" solo act",6,19 December 2014,"I expected big things from this film. Everyone I know who has seen Ace Ventura raves on about how it is a ""Must See Movie'. Is it though? Well, sorta. The film is VERY funny, but nearly all of the comedy stems from one man, Jim Carrey. Thankfully, and unsurprisingly, Carrey's performance is spot on. Like always, his unique comic style makes us laugh, and his incredible and over-the-top performance makes this film. Jim Carrey is the strongest presence on the screen, and thats not a bad thing, but it does overshadow the rest of the characters. What makes this film good is Jim Carrey, and that's the problem. The Story doesn't stand out on its own, and is hindered by a fair few outrageous plot devices, which is only saved by Carrey's equally as outrageous body language. None of the other characters made me laugh, and in a comedy that is a problem. Its not like the rest of the actors do a poor job, but there average performance is buried under loads and loads of Carrey's insane dialogue. However, Jim Carrey is still widely entertaining and hilarious. I genuinely laughed throughout this film, and would defiantly rate it much better then many other comedies out there. This might as well be a Jim Carrey solo performance, but at least he is funny enough and has a strong enough stage presence to really make this movie laugh-out-loud good.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

254,fajardani,A Misdguided Attempt at Family Comedy,5,25 February 2019,"Family films have always faced a big dilemma, as the name suggests for a movie to be considered in the genre of 'family' it needs to be able to connect and pleased every part of the family. Many filmmakers assumed that this meant they need to make their films to be more kid-friendly like Home Alone or The Karate Kid, both are perfectly adequate films that were clearly targeted more for kids than for adults and while there are a few pieces in the movie that can be enjoyed by adults or even teenagers, those moments were few and far between. There are also a lot of movies that able to blend the elements together well, giving a pleasant watch to all parts of the family, both the kids and the adults. movies like Up and Inside Out contain a deep emotional message that adult could appreciate but still provide more than enough bright colors, fantastical images, and ideas that a kid would enjoy.Of course, on the other hand of the spectrum there exist family movies that while it is still kid friendly decides to pander more to the adult elements rather than the kid. This technique, when done right like in The Princess Bride, could provide a better more enjoyable watching experience. The adults won't feel too forced in watching a supposedly kid-friendly movie while the kids could possibly learn something to accentuate their growth if the message shown in the movie was delivered correctly and all part of the family can have a good time. But, when it was done wrong, well you get Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.Released in 1994, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective was a story of a, well, a private-eye for pets (obviously). It stars Jim Carrey as the titular character Ace and he was given the task of finding the kidnapped (sorry, PETnapped) mascot of the NFL Miami Dolphins. When it first released, the movie becomes somewhat of a sleeper hit, grossing for a total of $102. million dollars against a $15 million dollar budget. However, the critical reception was abysmal, the movie was criticized for its raunchiness, the childish hi-jinks and overall mean-spirited humor portrayed by the main character.My personal opinion, I don't think this movie was made with the intention to make it a family movie, the level of raunchiness presented and the final villain twist are perhaps a bit too much for kids, especially at that time. Hell they even cast Jim Carrey, who at that point in time has only played in mostly adult-oriented comedy film like Earth Girls are Easy even more in that same year he starts in The Mask and Dumb & Dumber, both are not kids-friendly by any mean and both are widely more successful. No, this movie was not made to be a family-friendly film, however, this movie begins to be accepted as family films thanks to one specific group of people, parents. Any parents anywhere in the world at some point in their life would just pick up the first movie on the shelf that seemed harmless enough to show to their kids. those parents see Ace Ventura at the video store (it was released in 1994 okay, BlockBuster still relevant then), saw the word Pet and just say 'eh good enough' because kids love pets as much as they like to annoyed the closest adult they can find.So, that's why Ace Ventura would later be group under the category of family movies (even though it's not) and there were the weakness shows. As previously stated, a lot of the jokes did not connect to the kids' audience and even if the adults understand it, they won't like it because they felt it was inappropriate to show to children. Furthermore, there are not many scenes that could trigger the imaginative mind of children to keep them engaged. The scene where Ace walks into his apartment building and animals pop out everywhere and come to him was great but there are not enough of that. For a movie titled Pet Detective, other than that one scene there weren't that many animals seen.If you want to take the family aspect of the movie it still doesn't work well, the main character was just too goofy to be taken any seriously even by the standard of a comedy movie. In many adult comedy, there is often exist a straight man opposite of the quirky main character to instill a little bit of realism in the story. In this movie, Ace Ventura has a too big of a quirky personality that the straight-man character just doesn't work and there were 2 of those in this film (Courteney Cox's Melissa and Tone Loc's Emilio, three if you count Dan Marino). This made the movie lose every sense of realism needed to keep the adults' viewer more engaged in the story.However, this movie is not bereft of a good point. Jim Carrey, for all his downside, plays the titular character perfectly. Every line he spoke, every move he takes, the nonchalant swagger he shows, he basically commands every scene he's in. Every time he's on screen (and given he was the main character, he's on it a lot) you can't take your eyes off him. His facial expression, his body movement, he has truly taken this character to heart and made him, by far, the most entertaining parts of the movie. Yes, I did mention that his character basically engulfed every other character that he shares a scene with (except, surprisingly, Dan Marino) but well, what else is he gonna do, he's the titular character, this movie is about him so he plays it that way to keep your focus on the screen.Overall, this movie is quite disappointing, It started quite well to engage you and then give you another one of Jim Carrey memorable performance but then it dwindles into a tedious detective movie, the mystery was not engaging and quite predictable, it takes to much liberty in how they could incorporate more animals into the movie, took itself to seriously despite its goofy premise and quite frankly, it becomes a little bit inappropriate towards the end.A nice guilty pleasure but keep this one locked up from your kids.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

266,Cajadecarton,"Ace Ventura, Peeeeet Detective!",7,27 August 2010,"Hi there, In this film i love the way Jim Carrey make us laughs, with gestures, with his role that fits so well with their expressions, with that peculiar humor, laughter and those still finding their way from the beginning of the film to end.I love the way he, in a comedy for all ages, we are happy after each review, after every minute, so I think this is a film suitable for everyone with sufficient dose of humor.I hope you enjoy it as I do, because since then, I enjoyed as a little boy of all his crazy adventures as Ace Ventura, and that's why I love Pet Detective.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
267,sadib,laugh!,9,24 October 2003,"I laughed from moment 1 to the end of the movie. Don't watch if you're in a serious mood. I think Carrey is a slapstick genius. I'm not a native English speaker so when I watched it a second and a third time I heard more and more jokes. The jokes are so many, you can't hear them all in one time (at least I was too busy laughing).",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective

269,durgeshwarojha,Jim Carrey rocks!!!!,7,4 July 2014,"If there was something amazing in the movie it was Jim Carrey's acting. The faces he made & his acting forced me to laugh out loud after a long time.If you like comedy movies, don't miss this one.The story is about a kidnapped dolphin and Ace Ventura is a Pet Detective who is trying to find the dolphin.The story was pretty good but the film could be a little boring at times.That's why I gave it a 7.Watch it if you are a comedy fan, must watch if you're a Jim Carrey fan.Jim Carrey's my favourite comedian after this movie.I'm definitely gonna watch Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls after watching this one.Overall pretty good movie go and entertain yourself!!",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
270,JanTuts,Transphobic plot twist,1,20 October 2020,"Starts well enough, though quite forced and cringey at times.
But ultimately the plot twist is just utterly transphobic...
My advise: steer clear of this, there are plenty of actually good Jim Carrey movies to watch.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
271,pimpwitoutahand,Ill say this again...dont listen to these mentally ill apologists,10,5 June 2021,Its a great comedy that has decades worth of laughs never mind those individuals thatll shame you for liking this film cuz they are enablers to mentally disturbed people with body dysmorphia. Be your own critic and dont let others shame and belittle you for it. And you ppl name calling others for liking the film stop the conformity already. Stop the oppression of free thought!!!,Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
272,champion_girl_6,the funniest movie you will ever see!!!,9,22 July 2005,"Ace Ventura ,Pet detective is about an animal lover!! The movie is funny and enjoyable for all ages. Its when the Miami dolphins have there mascot snowflake taken and by circle of gossip he finds himself looking for a bottle-nosed dolphin. In a strange way ace ends up in a murder investigation. If your interested in a great,action filled comedy that this is the movie for you. Sure liar liar is good but this movie blows off the competition.I was laughing through the whole thing , man this movie always gives me a laugh no matter how many times I've seen it i will still laugh 1000 times and more!I think if you ever saw it you would be laughing your socks off too!!! its a great movie too watch any day of the week.Even when your feeling low it'll get you up!!!!",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
273,chris-00658,What were we thinking back then??!,2,13 December 2018,"When I watched this as an impressionable 12 year old I rembete finding it mildly funny but also uncomfortable but could not put my finger on why..
I now watch it as an adult and realise why.
This film is so dumb and really offensive. It is homophobic, transphobic, horrible to women and in poor taste of mental illness.
This would not get made today and belongs in the past.",Ace Ventura - Pet Detective
