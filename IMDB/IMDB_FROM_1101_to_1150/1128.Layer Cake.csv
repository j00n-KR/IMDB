0,Leofwine_draca,"Dumb, wannabe British gangster film",3,16 August 2016,"I'm a big fan of Guy Ritchie's British gangster films LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS and, especially, SNATCH, so when I saw this Daniel Craig-starrer was directed by the guy who produced those two films, I thought I'd check it out. Sadly, LAYER CAKE is a dull and derivative piece of work that shows what happens when film-makers churn out familiar, predictable movies in a bid to cash-in on the perceived current popularity of the genre. It happened with Japanese long-haired ghost girl movies, and it happened with British gangster movies. LAYER CAKE contains absolutely nothing we haven't seen before and it's a case of style over substance. Ritchie's films provide a liberal inspiration, as does Tarantino's PULP FICTION, but the difference is that LAYER CAKE has no heart and the style ain't that great, either.Things begin on a bad foot with some truly atrocious comedy from some 'chav'-type gangsters and after a while the story begins for real. Basically, it involves Daniel Craig and his criminal buddies getting involved with stolen drugs and rival gangsters, and it all gets very complicated and not very interesting. This might well have been the reason Craig became Bond, because his acting's great and the best thing in this film, but his character is unlikeable and doesn't get a chance to be developed enough. Elsewhere, the supporting actors seem to be just going through the ropes: Michael Gambon and Kenneth Cranham as older generation gangsters, Colm Meaney as yet ANOTHER shouty-sweary-sweaty guy (basically THE SAME as the character he played in CON AIR), Sienna Miller as a dumb bimbo and others besides.Granted, the film does have a few stand-out moments of genuine goodness; the sniper scene is one of these. There are some other memorable moments, usually the violent bits, a couple involving hot tea and an iron, but these are mere minutes in what seems like a very long film. The 'twist' ending is ripped straight out of CARLITO'S WAY and really was the final insult for this viewer. LAYER CAKE is a dumb, wannabe film and fans of the genre should stick with SNATCH.",Layer Cake
1,SnoopyStyle,got good intensity in a Guy Ritchie style story,7,3 September 2015,"XXXX (Daniel Craig) considers himself to be a business as he quietly and carefully becomes the biggest cocaine supplier in London. Morty is his loyal muscle. Then crime boss Jimmy Price forces XXXX to find Eddie Temple's daughter Charlie. Jimmy assigns his man Gene (Colm Meaney) to help. At the same time, he's trying buy a large shipment from Duke who stole it from a gang of Serbian war criminals. He falls for party girl Tammy (Sienna Miller).Matthew Vaughn delivers a harsh twisty crime movie. Daniel Craig has a tough menace that allows him to take center in a wild and densely packed crime story. There are a few too many characters with a couple of too many twists. Craig maintains the attention. Vaughn has taken a bit of Guy Ritchie's sensibilities and added his own intensity.",Layer Cake
2,Prismark10,Have your cake and eat it,8,18 October 2013,"Matthew Vaughn who produced the Guy Ritchie gangster films steps in for his directorial debut with Layer Cake.The film opens with a stylised sequence that grabs you buy the lapels as Daniel Craig goes through a few house rules on being player in the drugs trade.This is the film that is said to have convinced the Bond producers that Craig was the man to get 007 status.Craig plays a suave cocaine dealer who is more a businessman than a gangster and with a sideline in a legitimate business. With enough money laundered he is on the verge of calling it quits but like the Pacino character in Carlito's Way, things are never that simple when you want to walk away.When crime boss Jimmy Price wants him to do a few favours things rapidly spiral out of control. He is implicated with rival gangsters, a Serb hitman and various double crosses.Craig holds your attention from the very beginning, the plot rattles along at an entertaining pace. It maybe is one of the better British gangster films in the last 20 years.",Layer Cake
3,claudio_carvalho,The Intermediate Has Low Risks,7,17 November 2007,"The successful drug dealer Mr. X (Daniel Craig) plans his criminal career intermediating business with drugs without calling the attention, working with a small gang and honoring his payments with the suppliers. On the day planned for his early retirement, the powerful mobster Jimmy Price (Kenneth Cranham) gives two assignments to him: find Charlie, the addicted daughter of his associate Eddie Temple (Michael Gambon) and negotiate um million pills of high-quality ecstasy with the stupid smalltime gangster Duke (Jamie Foreman). Mr. X hires two acquaintances crooks in a night-club to find Charlie, and he unexpectedly meets Duke's cousin Sidney (Ben Whishaw) with his sexy girlfriend Tammy (Sienna Miller) and flirts with her. But Mr. X discovers that the ecstasy was stolen from the dangerous and wild Serbian drug lord Dragan (Dragan Micanovic) that wants the head of Duke and the drugs back. Further, Eddie shows a tape proving that he has been double-crossed by Jimmy, and also wants the ecstasy. The smart Mr. X plots a scheme to resolve the situation and meet Tammy.""Layer Cake"" is a hilarious entertainment that follows the style of ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch"". The unpredictable screenplay has many plot points, disclosing a cynical story with amoral characters in a very-fast pace. The anti-hero performed by Daniel Craig is very clever and smart, and the twist in the conclusion is a great surprise. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Nem Tudo É o Que Parece"" (""Not Everything Is What Seems to Be"")",Layer Cake
4,lee_eisenberg,James Bond meets Albus Dumbledore meets Bane meets Michael Banks meets the woman who loved the fish-man,5,7 March 2019,"Had I seen ""Layer Cake"" and not known who the director is, I would've guessed Guy Ritchie. It's an unabashedly violent look at organized crime in England. Daniel Craig plays a cocaine distributor who's not fond of violent acts but remains immersed in a world of violence. Just get ready to see every form of violence imaginable here.Having never seen the movie until now, I was impressed to see a number of people in early roles. Michael Gambon and Colm Meaney were the established actors, and Daniel Craig was still two years away from James Bond. Aside from Craig, there's also Tom Hardy, Ben Whishaw and Sally Hawkins, all of whom have played notable roles since the movie's release. ""Layer Cake"" is no masterpiece but still a piece of nice fun if you're looking for brain candy.",Layer Cake
5,jboothmillard,Layer Cake,5,3 November 2008,"Before he became James Bond for the 21st Century, this film demonstrates the leading actor's range, in a pretty good drug filled crime thriller, from BAFTA nominated newcomer director Matthew Vaughn (Stardust, and producer of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels). Basically successful cocaine dealer XXXX (Daniel Craig) plans early retirement from the business, but he is given a tough assignment from big boss Jimmy Price (Kenneth Cranham) to find Charlie Ryder (Nathalie Lunghi), missing rich daughter of Jimmy's pal Eddie Temple (Sir Michael Gambon). Besides this, the other main plot is XXXX trying to find some pills and give them to the right person. Also starring Colm Meaney as Gene, George Harris as Morty, Jamie Foreman as JD 'The Duke', Marcel Iures as Slavo, Tom Hardy as Clarkie, Ben Whishaw as Sidney, Sienna Miller as Tammy, Dexter Fletcher as Cody, Sally Hawkins as Slasher, Jason Flemyng as Larry, Burn Gorman as Gazza and Tamer Hassan as Terry. Craig is playing someone nowhere similar to Bond, and a good character it is, Gambon has his moments too, a good near gangster movie. Worth watching!",Layer Cake
6,rmax304823,Interesting Genre Piece.,6,5 July 2016,"Daniel Craig does well in the role of a middleman between the higher-echelon drug dealers and the users. He's asked by his superior to do one last job. And at that point I got lost. I wish these blokes would learn to speak proper English so that a educated end tacitful man such as myself could unnerstand them. I mean, really. ""Child"" comes out ""chow."" And ""Pal"" becomes ""pow."" It's pretty violent, although the violence isn't dwelt on with the kind of relish we find in American horror movies. Okay, a lopped off head here and there but they're tastefully half hidden under the blue ice and soft drinks in the cooler.Craig is constantly referred to as ""a smart fellow."" That, at any rate, is what the superb Michael Gambon calls him. Geeze, Gambon could easily be on Mount Rushmore with much alteration in size -- a monument of a face made up of an infinite number of wrinkles and folds of flesh.Others have compared Craig to Steve McQueen in ""Bullet"" but I don't know why. Craig gets the stuffing beaten out of him, and he hates guns, and he bleats with fear when they hang him over the edge of a rooftop. But, though he may not be cool, there is a faint physical resemblance to McQueen.There are some nice directorial touches too, as well as some crummy ones, as in the scene in which the camera takes the POV of a victim being beaten half to death by a huge black guy.Definitely worth a watch if you can follow the twisted plot and the dialog that serves as trailway markers.",Layer Cake
7,Tweekums,The story of a businessman whose business happens to be illegal,9,5 March 2011,"Before Daniel Craig shot to international stardom as James Bond he proved he had the acting skills to play such a character in this film. Craig's drug dealing character might sound very different to Bond but both are very much in control and will do what it takes to stay in control. Here his character is less reckless even though he is a criminal; he doesn't seek the limelight, want to be a 'name', carry a firearm or associate with people who do. In fact he is planning to retire until his boss Jimmy calls him in for two jobs; find the daughter of a friend who has disappeared from drug rehab and purchase a consignment of ecstasy that has just arrived in the country The problem is that the importer is 'The Duke', a man who thinks he is a big time gangster but is really just a muppet who is bound to get caught or killed sooner or later as he has no idea what discretion means and has got hot drugs by stealing them from some incredibly dangerous people; people that want them back. Craig initially has no idea the drugs were stolen nor does he know that Jimmy has been setting him up; the father of the girl he is seeking does not want Jimmy knowing where she is as Jimmy holds him responsibly for a disastrous business deal. When Craig realises what is going on he must deal with these various problems while avoiding the Serbian hit-man who wants him dead or the drugs and 'The Duke'.This film was very stylish and Daniel Craig was brilliant in the lead roll; you may wonder why I haven't mentioned his name, it is because we are never told; even the credits just refer to him as XXXX! He isn't the only actor putting in a fine performances; Kenneth Cranham is great as Jimmy, a man not as intelligent as he believes and Michael Gambon was suitably menacing as Eddie; the father of the missing girl. Being a gangster film there are a few violent scenes some of which are quite brutal even though little is seen. The ending, which I won't spoil is quite a shock and will not be forgotten once seen.",Layer Cake
8,blanche-2,Crime doesn't pay,6,12 May 2010,"I watched the 2004 film ""Layer Cake"" because of its star, Daniel Craig. I recently saw Craig in ""A Steady Rain"" on Broadway and was blown away by what a great actor he is. In fact, had I not known it was Daniel Craig on stage, I would not have recognized him.Craig is a natural for movies with his blond good looks and striking blue eyes. Here he plays a nameless cocaine dealer who wants to retire. He's asked by a crime boss named Jimmy Price (Kenneth Cranham) to find the drugged out daughter of a friend, and he doesn't give the Craig character much choice in the matter. Before he knows it, our potential retiree is blamed for a drug heist he didn't engineer, and if he doesn't recover the goods, he's toast.There are some heavy accents here which can be difficult to understand, but first-time director Michael Vaughn does a solid job with what could have been a confusing and convoluted story. In his hands, even with dozens of characters and several plots, it is fairly easy to follow.Craig is convincing and sexy, and Michael Gambon does his usual terrific job as Eddie Temple; Sienna Miller is on hand as a potential girlfriend for the Craig character. The supporting cast of assorted low-lifes, killers, and addicts, are all very believable.I have a feeling a lot of the reviews on this site were written by men. I found the violence in this film, while appropriate to the story, a little too graphic for me. Neat film, though.",Layer Cake
9,hitchcockthelegend,"I'm not a gangster, just a businessman. And my commodity happens to be cocaine.",9,30 April 2009,"With a considerable amount of cash saved from his, ahem, dealings. A London drug dealer is all set to retire abroad and start a new life. However his mob boss Jimmy Price has two jobs for him to do immediately...Layer Cake is directed by Matthew Vaughn. Vaughn is more well known as Guy Ritchie's producer on his early British gangster genre forays. Suffice to say he had some insight into what made those films {Snatch et al} hugely popular with the watching British public. How pleasing it is then to say that Vaughn, by showing restraint and an unfussy approach, has crafted a film that's more than equal to the best of Britain gangster faves, and actually sets new parameters for toning a film. By focusing more on mood and atmosphere over bombastic scenarios, Vaughn, aided by a superlative Daniel Craig as the nameless dealer, lifts the film above its conventional plot arc. In what could have been a standard tale of a man doing one last job before going straight, we, along with Craig, find that all roads are blocked, it's as if there is some higher force at work here.Layer Cake also scores high for its more easy on the eye filming of London, this is no destitute capital where tower blocks loom like monsters over the characters. This London is thriving, vim and vitality, the place to be, seediness is far from the ebullient crowd. Ben Davis' photography perfectly complimenting the engrossing score from Lisa Gerrard & Ilan Eshkeri, both of which serve to make London an extra character in the story. The film however is not perfect, at 105 minutes it's actually too short, something that only becomes apparent when all the plot strands come crashing together in a rushed last quarter. Yet in spite of that failing, the ending delivers a jolt to the system, to crown, what to me at least, is one of Britain's finest and tidiest gangster offerings. 9/10",Layer Cake
10,Theo Robertson,The Fault Of British Film Making Strikes Again,7,13 November 2012,"This was something of a sleeper hit and you can understand why it wasn't an overnight success on its release in 2004 . "" Goodness me another Brit flick featuring gangsters haven't seen one of those since the last British film was released £ . Come to think of it that's what everyone in Britain would have said in 2003 , 2002 and well what year was LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS released ? That said LAYER CAKE sticks out from the Guy Ritchie clones because of its leading man and its director with Daniel Craig and Mathew Vaughn going on to bigger and better things . Deservedly I might I add and for the most part LAYER CAKE is superb but then like so many British films it falls apart. The cake obviously needed a bit more foundation in its making It does get off to a great start where Craig's nameless anti-hero recounts his life of crime and right away it has social relevance as he makes a very cogent and simple point that drugs are bad but the criminalisation of drugs is much worse . This intelligent thinking is complimented by the use of intelligent language of cinema . All too often a British movie looks like it's made for television but despite having a relatively low budget Vaughn lays on an eye catching visual style that hypnotises the audience as we're told a tale involving a drug heist going wrong , Serbian war criminals on the rampage and a man who is willing to pay anything to find his missing daughter So far so good but as stated like so many and too many films from Britain the first half can't keep up with the second half . As soon as Michael Gambon's posh gangster turns up the film starts to meander all over the place . Looking at the trivia section it says that JJ Connoly's novel was 344 pages long whilst his original draft of the screenplay was 404 pages so he effectively wrote the screenplay for a film lasting 404 minutes and has had to ditch half of it . This explains the unsatisfactory nature of the narrative and aspects involving characters and plot turns appear and disappear for no reason . The screenplay is if not a mess then at least over complicated to say the least What stops the film being ruined by it - and which why it was a success with the critics who'd no doubt seen too many of these type of Brit gangster flicks - is that the audience will be swept up by the visual style of the film and its lead actor . It'd be very easy to say that it's style over substance and to be honest that's what it is . However the directing , editing and musical score is so good that all the flaws with the story telling can be instantly forgiven and forgotten",Layer Cake
11,jotix100,"Tiramisu, or ecstasy?",7,18 June 2005,"""Layer Cake"" the stylish neo noir film by Matthew Vaughn, making his directorial debut, shows a man with enormous potential to do much better in future projects. The film, based on J.J. Connelly's novel, is a study about the drug business by some ruthless people that are making a lot of money with their illegal commerce.Point in case, the nameless hero of the story who figures he has played the game right and now is about to make an exit from the business. Little does he know that his friend Jimmy Price has other ideas for him to execute, no doubt driven by a desire to get him in trouble, as proves to be the case.""Layer Cake"" screams for a second viewing. In fact, it is probably a requirement because it will make things clearer to the viewer who might get lost in this story with so many twists and turns.Daniel Craig is the best thing going in the movie. In fact, he kept reminding us of a young Steve McQueen because of his cool demeanor and how he seems to move effortlessly throughout the film. Kenneth Cranham, as Jimmy Price, is also another actor whose contribution is an asset in the film. Michael Gambon, leaner and tanner, is a cool drug lord who rules a vast empire. Colm Meaney also is excellent, as well as the extensive cast.Look for the next film by Matthew Vaughn!",Layer Cake
12,poolandrews,Dull & turgid British gangster flick that has no spark.,3,16 February 2010,"Layer Cake is set in London England where a cool,calm collected man (Daniel Craig) is a middle man for drug trafficking but after making a million pounds he intends to retire. Drug lord Jimmy Price (Kenneth Cranham) has one last job for him his cohorts, Jimmy wants him to negotiate a deal between himself & the Duke (Jamie Foreman) who has just stolen a million ecstasy tablets from Serbian war criminal drug dealers from Amsterdam & find a potential buyer as well. He does as he is told but soon finds himself caught in the middle of an international drugs war as the Serbs want their ecstasy back, big time gangster Eddie Temple (Michael Gambon) wants the drugs for himself while it seems that our man has been caught right in the middle as everyone holds him personally responsible...Also annoyingly known as L4yer Cake this British gangster flick (yes, another one) was produced & directed by Matthew Vaughn, it was written by J.J. Conolly based on his novel of the same name & maybe I was expecting another Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) or Snatch (2000) but I thought Layer cake was a dull & lifeless crime thriller that plodded along making me more bored by the second. For a start there are too many character's who are too similar, men in suits who swear a lot & act tough for instance, cocky young drug dealers & ruthless bosses & the fact that the main character played by Daniel Craig is so flat & personality free, I mean he isn't even given a name let alone any sort of background. Then there's the fractured plot which I found confusing as things would suddenly happen or change & there would be no time to take it in, it just seems to go from one situation or one set of character's far too quickly & it just ended up feeling like one big unfocused mess. Layer cake has to be one of the longest 101 minute films I have ever sat through. Unlike other notable British gangster flicks there's no comedy here, the over the top eccentric character's are nowhere to be seen & there's very little incident. I also want to point out that the plot revolves around drug dealers & I just can't agree with glamorising this activity, I know it's a film but it stresses the point that dealing in drugs is an easy way to make loads of money & it never shows the consequences of what drugs do. Besides being boring it just left a bad taste in my mouth.Apparently Guy Ritchie was set to direct Layer Cake but he dropped out & it really could have done with his humorous & sarcastic dialogue, his pacing & his style of plot twist's rather than the lifeless dull affair we end up with. Layer cake is a lot, lot more restrained than either of Ritchie's films & boy does it tell, not a whole lot happens considering how long Layer Cake lasts. The title Layer Cake refers to the multi layered structure of the crime world, most people probably won't know that so that point will be lost on them. The film has it's stylish moments but too many long dull stretches, I saw this on telly after walking past a dirt cheap second hand Blu-ray in a shop for months & I ma very glad I didn't spend any money on it. As far as I am concerned it stay on that shelf gathering dust.With a fairly modest $4,000,000 (Daniel Craig probably earns more than that per film now) this looks good & has nice production values but I doubt I will remember much about it by the end of the week. The acting is alright but restrained & Daniel Craig is surprisingly flat & lifeless & just doesn't seem interested.Layer Cake is a film that I really disliked, the average user rating on the IMDb would suggest that I am in the minority but that's OK with me just so long as I don't have to watch Layer Cake again. A big disappointment & contrary to the IMDb user rating no-one I know who has seen it likes it either.",Layer Cake
13,dbborroughs,Well made but confusing story of a drug dealer who can't get out of the business despite his best efforts,7,26 November 2005,"An unnamed drug dealer is considering retirement. Unexpectedly his boss asks to see him. During lunch our hero is asked to perform two favors which will spiral his life wildly out of control. The first is finding the missing daughter of his boss's friend, the other is dealing with a large shipment of pills from Amsterdam. How the two tasks take over his life and make retirement less certain than a casket is the bulk of the movie.From the producer of ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch"" comes ""Layer Cake"" a film trying to become a companion piece to the two earlier Guy Ritchie films. It has witty lines, excellent acting, explosive violence and confusing plot. It all makes for a good but far from great thriller. The trouble is that where the Ritchie films made sense eventually, the plot here just gets more and more convoluted as they go. Tension is kept up because we are never really sure what is going on. I was an hour in and had to pause the film to confer with my dad to see if we missed something, apparently we hadn't. While it could be argued that we know as much as our hero knows, It seems to me that there are times when he does things that are based on what he knows, not what we know. I liked the film, but I didn't love it. Its a great style piece or calling card, but its not anything great in and of itself.If you like crime thrillers give the film a try but I think you'll be likely to like it more than love it. 6.5 out of 10.",Layer Cake
14,Bunuel1976,"LAYER CAKE (Matthew Vaughn, 2004) ***",7,28 May 2010,"In a way, director Vaughn's first film is his most conventional – being basically an addition to the recent spate of British gangster movies. It is particularly indebted to Guy Ritchie's acclaimed entries in the field (though these always felt to me like pale imitations of the hipper Quentin Tarantino style); the comparison is unsurprising given that Vaughn had actually produced the first two of them (even if he seems to have drawn bigger inspiration for his own film from the work of Martin Scorsese)! Anyway, having myself watched a few titles made in this vein in the past (citing from memory, those would be Ritchie's LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS [1998], SNATCH [2002] and REVOLVER [2005], as well as Jonathan Glazer's SEXY BEAST [2001]), I have to admit to not being a fan. They often provide convoluted yet thoroughly dreary plot lines, revolting characters with invariably impenetrable accents and an even more mannered (i.e. alienating) approach to technique. To be sure, LAYER CAKE suffers from all of the above to some degree or other, resulting in a patchy overall effort; however, it is noted as the film to have put lead Daniel Craig definitely into the running for the coveted part of James Bond, and that must account for something! Indeed, his character is unusually smart for this type of fare (though there is always somebody else who manages to upstage him); that said, equally impressive is the contribution of Colm Meaney (evoking Gene Hackman) and Michael Gambon (lending class to the whole set-up as a gangland boss), while Sienna Miller is featured as a girl with whom Craig hooks up briefly.Incidentally, having various factions of diverse stature embroiled in the ongoing shady business, gives rise to one of the movie's ultimate pitfalls: with the myriad twists and double-crosses involved (some of them presented merely in flashback), one is liable to become confused where individual characters' loyalties actually lieso that the film's lasting impact depends on its ability to supply a steady flow of memorable incident (punctuated by a typically fantastic soundtrack). This is certainly the case here, as can be attested by such scenes as the impromptu aggression in the diner, the threat of a roof-top plunge, the stealthy settling of scores (with Craig in a ninja-like costume, thus preceding Vaughn's own KICK-ASS [2010]) – actually reprised at the finale, albeit now carried out in broad daylight and being off-set by personal matters rather than professional ethics – and the sniper getting a dose of his own medicine.When all is said and done, though LAYER CAKE (the metaphorical title, by the way, is only explained towards the very end) is clearly above-average for a modern gangster outing, it is not quite in the same league as such wide-ranging classics of hard-hitting British cinema as Alberto Cavalcanti's THEY MADE ME A FUGITIVE (1947), Joseph Losey's THE CRIMINAL (1960) and Mike Hodges' GET CARTER (1971)",Layer Cake

16,zardoz-13,Crime Doesn't Pay,8,5 January 2012,"Matthew Vaughn's British ultra-cool crime thriller ""Layer Cake"" reminds me of something that either Martin Scorsese or Guy Ritchie has wrought. Interestingly, Ritchie was going to helm it but scheduling conflicts thwarted it. This atmospheric mobster melodrama concerns rivalries within the underworld rather than with the law. A brainless, wannabe gangster steals a cornucopia of drugs at gunpoint from an Amsterdam dealer and pays the price for his perfidy. The standard complaint about charismatic crime films like Vaughn's trendy thriller is that they encourage immature people to enter the world of crime. Nothing could be farther from the truth about ""Layer Cake."" This profane, sometimes violent, 105-minute opus amounts to more of a cautionary tale rather that a celebration of lawlessness. Vaughn and scenarist J.J. Connolly, who wrote the novel, filter the narrative through the eyes of a successful cocaine dealer known only as Mr. X. Indeed, Vaughn and Connolly never reveal his name. Our anonymous protagonist has a set of commandments that he follows rigidly, but nothing that he does keeps him from paying the price that all do who live by the sword. Daniel Craig is terrific as the enterprising coke dealer who winds up doing the very things that he hates so that he can secure his future. The trouble is that he is surrounded by treacherous people. The people that he trusts the most are the ones who abhor him the most. Everybody between those people who XXXX associates with on a buddy-buddy basis are as snowed about this one particular crime lord. Essentially, the individual who winds up creating the most trouble is a boorish, well-to-do, middle-aged mobster named Jimmy Price who has been getting away with murder. Jimmy is churlish, ignorant, and thoroughly treacherous. Meanwhile, XXXX and his friends treat him like a father. Unfortunately for our hero, nothing goes right because he has made a bad mistake about treating Jimmy with respect. The gallery of hoods who surround XXXX are an interesting, colorful group. The only thing bad about this entertaining opus is the killjoy ending. Happily, the DVD and the Blu-Ray contain two alternate endings.",Layer Cake

18,Boba_Fett1138,It's a well made but unnecessary confusing movie to watch.,7,28 September 2007,"This is a rather well made and flashy movie, that in the end is still nothing more than an average British crime movie.The fact that this movie doesn't really raise above the level of average is due to the story. It's not necessarily a movie with a confusing story but its more a movie that makes things unnecessarily hard on itself, just to let the story seem more complex than it in fact truly is. It's as if the movie tried too hard to be something that it just isn't. On top of that the story also isn't always interesting or original enough to follow. The beginning is good and so is the ending but the middle drags a little and offers little new.So you can say that the story-telling is worse than the actual story. Sure the movie is made with lots of pace and style but it seemed to me as if the director lost track of things at times. Matthew Vaughn is also still a beginning director, so I'm sure of it he will learn from his mistakes and he'll become a better director one day. It isn't really a tough gangster flick, though the intentions are definitely there. I feel that the movie would had been a better one of it was even more brutal and straight-forward. Also some more humor and less serious characters would had worked out better for the movie. No, this really unfortunately ain't no Guy Ritchie movie, who still makes the best British gangster movies.But of course this still obviously is a good movie to watch. The actors carry the movie and in the end the movie also offers some nice and thoughtful twists, like you always could expect from a British gangster movie.Daniel Craig was a surprising and great leading actor. It's not his best role but still he mostly carries the movie entirely on his own. The movie is still filled with lots of fine supporting actors, such as Colm Meaney, Michael Gambon, Dragan Micanovic, Sienna Miller, Dexter Fletcher and George Harris. Especially nice to see Colm Meaney in a big production again. Sienna Miller's role seemed to be completely redundant on some other characters on the other hand got underused, such as the Dragan Micanovic's one.A rather good movie to watch but not the must-see everyone makes you believe it is.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Layer Cake

21,Uriah43,An Exceptional Film,8,25 September 2012,"This is a very complex film. Not only are there several plot twists which require adjustments but there are also multiple characters who come and go throughout the movie as well. If that wasn't challenging enough, the heavy English accents were sometimes very difficult to understand which further complicated everything. If anything though, this made the film more interesting because it required my full attention. Essentially, Daniel Craig (the main character who is never identified by name) plays a drug dealer who wants to call it quits. Unfortunately, his boss doesn't want him to and gives him two assignments to accomplish before he retires. Both have difficulties which get him in over his head. Rather than spoil the rest of the movie I'll just leave it at that. To that end, allow me to say that he performed exceptionally well--as did George Harris (Monty), Kenneth Cranham (Jimmy Price) and Colm Meaney (Gene). Overall it had a good cast, good script, and good location (Amsterdam). I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to those who like this type of movie. An exceptional film.",Layer Cake
22,ferguson-6,What's in your freezer?,8,5 June 2005,"Greetings again from the darkness. British drama is usually at its best when subtle humor abounds. The English are masters at underplaying very funny lines and situations. First time director, Matthew Vaughn, like it or not, arrives with very high expectations after producing two classics: ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch"".There are two ways to look at ""Layer Cake"". First, it is quite a disappointment because it has neither the frantic pacing, nor the sharp humor of the previously mentioned films. The second option, and my preferred method, would be to embrace Cake for what it is; a stylish, taut crime drama with terrific characters.The film begins with the lead, actor Daniel Craig, providing a synopsis of his business philosophy as it relates to the drug peddling industry. He is matter of fact and views it as any other business. Although, we believe HE believes this, it is our first warning that he is in for quite a ride. Men of honor do not earn their livings in such ways. The next two hours are a fun, interesting, twisting ride through the drug underworld and a lesson in how deals are done and transactions are confirmed. The setting could be a private room at an exclusive country club or a dark room in a deserted warehouse. It matters little to the players.Daniel Craig (""Road To Perdition"") has been mentioned as the next Bond. I had hoped ""Layer Cake"" would help me see this. Sadly, it reinforces my belief that he has not the looks, talent or presence to pull off the role. He is more Timothy Dalton than Sean Connery. On the other hand, he is a perfect fit as the no-name, smarter-than-you, afraid of guns, in it for the money drug dealer.Veteran Michael Gambon adds a punch of welcome evil to the film as Craig's nemesis and overall, director Vaughn has assembled a nice collection of gritty English actors who successfully pull off their characters.The English rock soundtrack begins with The Cult and ends with Joe Cocker's wailing rendition of ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood"". How can you go wrong with that? A little more humor in the script and Vaughn would have had another instant classic, but we will settle for an interesting and watchable film!",Layer Cake

This task won't be nearly as simple though, with all the double-dealings, and whatnot. This film was a very nice foray into the English gangster drama, all the actors do a magnificent job, the cinematography superb and I found it to be quite gripping indeed.

24,gradyharp,Meltdown: The Rise and Fall of a 'Good' Criminal,8,24 August 2005,"LAYER CAKE is a film to be watched with all of your senses alert: it is best viewed after a caffeine jag, or way before bedtime as it demands full attention to follow this circuitous and at times meandering plot. You have to work at this one but in the end the work pays off - sort of.To begin with the main character (Daniel Craig) is a nameless 'good criminal' middleman working quietly producing Ecstasy pills. His motto is work small, stay quiet, pay your people on time, and get out when you can. The remainder of the story is how our nameless 'hero' becomes insidiously involved in the various layers of his chosen crime of drug trafficking and the results of his blood-streaked rise to the top layer of the cake. There are so many characters involved in this story (each well acted, tidy cameos) that soon you lose track of who's who and who just got whacked. It is a violent climb to the top and a surprise ending that in retrospect should have seemed apparent.Daniel Craig plays his heart out with this character and he is joined by such luminaries as Michael Gambon and Colm Meany in pulling off a pulsating crime drama. Yes, it is in the same realm as 'The Usual Suspects' and other British wham bang high-density flicks. The goods are delivered - but the question arises as to who cares? Perfect for this genre, but keep the coffee brewing lest you let your attention lag. Grady Harp",Layer Cake
25,The_Void,"Slightly, but not much, more than the average Brit crime flick",6,19 September 2005,"Layer Cake is the latest in a long line of British crime flicks, which was started off by Guy Richie's excellent 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'. Despite claiming proudly on it's poster that this film is from the same producers as the aforementioned flick; Layer Cake lacks the exuberant fun element of Lock, Stock and although it's certainly not a dead loss; this is only a decent crime flick, as opposed to a must see. This film has been based on a book, and so as you might expect; it has rather more to say than Guy Richie usually does. The film outlines the hypocrisy and stupidity of the way that drugs and drug dealers are handled by the British government, while also delivering a streak of the age-old 'crime doesn't pay' idea, which is analysed by the way that our hero isn't able to up sticks and leave his old life of crime behind just like that. The film follows a man whose name is never mentioned. This guy has been dealing cocaine successfully for years, but wants to quit while he's still ahead. His efforts to do that are thwarted by his business contacts; as this guy can't get out if they wont let him.The film is very slick and very glamorous, and it's portrayal of drug dealers is always done in a very positive light. This is offset by the way that the users are portrayed, but on the whole; this razzle-dazzle style that so many crime flicks go for doesn't interest me much. The downtrodden atmosphere that Lock, Stock created fit it's subject much better and is easier to relate to. Still, seeing the good-looking stars prance around glamorous settings does have it's own certain appeal. Up until about the hour mark, slight niggles aside - I was really enjoying Layer Cake. The film takes a downturn at about that point, however, when it's slightly confusing narrative used throughout the rest of the film goes into overdrive and cant really resolve itself. The ending also annoyed me, as it seemed like an attempt to be clever but came off as being more of a cop-out. Despite it's flaws, however, crime fans are bound to like this film. It has some good dialogue, it looks lovely and the way that it analyses the structure of the crime underworld is well done and, mostly, interesting.",Layer Cake
26,zetes,"Not the kind of film I usually like much, so my opinion wasn't much of a surprise",5,8 March 2015,"I have to admit, I'm no fan of British gangster flicks. For one thing, I find those slangy British accents pretty difficult to understand. I do like Matthew Vaughns follow-ups - he's become a pretty reliable Hollywood director. This isn't particularly different from the Guy Ritchie movies I hate so much. Too clever by half, too convoluted, and at best it only feels like cut-rate Scorsese. Daniel Craig stars as XXXX (his character has no name, and he makes that a big point right at the end, like it's really important or something), a mid-level drug dealer who wants to treat his work as a real business, that is, without the violence usually associated with it. But that wouldn't make for a very fun movie, so some of his associates decide to muck things up and Craig gets caught up in the middle. Colm Meanie and Michael Gambon are the biggest co-stars, but nowadays one might be more interested in the small roles of Tom Hardy and Sally Hawkins. Hawkins in particular is fun to watch as an uzi-wielding drug bandit named Slasher.",Layer Cake
27,JamesHitchcock,Low Life and High Society,6,15 March 2021,"Although there have been some excellent examples, such as ""Brighton Rock"", ""Get Carter"" and ""Mona Lisa"", gangster films have traditionally not had the same cultural importance in the British cinema as they have in America, possibly because organised gangsterism has not been such a problem in this country. (The heyday of the Kray and Richardson gangs in the 1960s was about as close as we ever came to having our own homegrown Mafia). Since the success of Guy Ritchie's ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" in the late nineties, however, there has been a modest revival of the British gangster flick.""Layer Cake"" was directed by Matthew Vaughn, who produced ""Lock, Stock..."". It revolves around the life of an anonymous London cocaine dealer (referred to in the cast list as ""XXXX""). XXXX, who prides himself on the professionalism with which he runs his operation, has made a handsome amount of money and is hoping to retire from crime so that he can enjoy life in his elegant mews residence. Before he can do so, however, his chief supplier Jimmy Price has two final tasks for him.The first task is to track down Charlotte Temple, the missing wayward socialite daughter of one of Jimmy's associates. The second is to supervise the purchase of a million ecstasy tablets from a gangster known as ""the Duke."" Unknown to XXXX, both these tasks come with complications. Jimmy claims that he wants to find Charlotte as a favour to her father Eddie, an old friend. The truth is that she is not really missing but Jimmy wants to find her to use her as a hostage in his dealings with Eddie. (The two have fallen out over a business deal that went wrong). As for the ecstasy tablets, the Duke has stolen them from a ruthless Serbian gang who are determined to get them back. The plot gets very complicated, so I will not attempt to summarise it any further.The title ""Layer Cake"" refers to social strata, especially in the criminal underworld, but also to those in wider British society. The film has some sharp points to make about the British social system, as there are certain points of contact between the ""layers"" of the criminal world and those of society as a whole. At the bottom of the pile are the criminal underclass of crude low-life thugs. Just above them are small-time gangsters like the Duke, whose nickname is clearly ironic as nobody would take him as part of the criminal aristocracy. Next come people like Jimmy Price, a big-time gangster who likes to pose as a legitimate businessman, and finally someone like Eddie Temple, a legitimate, or at least semi-legitimate, businessman who retains links to the underworld yet whose wealth enables him to pose, if not as a bona fide aristocrat, at least as a respectable High Society figure. XXXX seems to believe that by giving up his life of crime he can achieve a similar respectability, but of course cutting his links to the underworld proves more difficult than he imagined.The film reminded me in some ways of ""London Boulevard"", another 21st century British gangster movie. Both were the work of first-time directors, Vaughn here and William Monahan in the case of ""London Boulevard"". Both films are, on a technical level, accomplished pieces of film-making, telling their story in a fluent and compelling manner, and both are attractively photographed, with good use made of London scenes. Both contain some decent acting from the cast. Daniel Craig's XXXX may be a villain, but at least Craig makes him a cool and stylish one, and there are some good supporting performances. The one that stood out for me was from Michael Gambon as Eddie Temple. (It is said that Craig's performance here was responsible for his inning the coveted role of James Bond).My main problem with ""London Boulevard"" was that all the characters, virtually without exception, were so unsympathetic, and this was perhaps an even greater problem with ""Lock, Stock..."", a film which has always struck me as greatly overrated. (As has its director, the former Mr Madonna Guy Ritchie). I will not pretend that this was not also a problem with ""Layer Cake"", but because of its intriguing analysis of the nexus between criminality and social class I am prepared to rate the film higher than ""London Boulevard"", and certainly higher than ""Lock, Stock..."". 6/10",Layer Cake
28,jdesando,Energy and Irony.,8,8 June 2005,"Layer Cake is a slick caper, noir import from England with energy and irony enough for both sides of the Atlantic. XXXX (Daniel Craig) is a very satisfied drug dealer, wealthy and in control of his little world. His initial voice-over, reminiscent of Ray Liotta's in Casino, has the bounce of a man who found his calling, from which he plans to retire.Enter an uber-boss with a small job for XXXX to do: Find the cocaine-addicted daughter of an even more powerful lord. XXXX finds himself in a much bigger world of much tougher hoods, who don't respect his control of his world. The intricacies of this dense plot, with enough minor characters to start a clown troupe, are challenging because of too many ends not tied (What happened to the girl?) and those damnably beautiful but often incomprehensible British dialects. Anglophile that I am and English major that I was, I sometimes have difficulty understanding anyone in the film but the memorable Michael Gambon, whose thespian experience is so varied that he instinctively straddles the line between upper class diction and lower class cockney.The real business of Layer Cake is business itself, how to conduct it, be successful, and get out alive. Advice such as sticking to a plan and being a good middleman takes a life or death cast to it and retains emphasis as those who don't follow the advice drop away in the film. The cake has too many layers to be underestimated.Daniel Craig is rumored to be the top candidate after Pierce Brosnan for the next James Bond.

30,Buddy-51,classy English crime drama,8,2 November 2006,"""Layer Cake"" is one of those gritty, down-home gangster pictures that the Brits routinely toss off with such remarkably little effort. Daniel Craig plays a seasoned cocaine dealer (known only as XXXX) who's recently had visions of ""retiring"" from the job, but who finds it's a lot harder getting out of the ""business"" than it ever was getting in - but then it always is when you've sold your soul to the devil, as Craig's character clearly has.With its plethora of characters and profusion of subplots, the script (by J.J. Connolly, derived from his own novel), presents a challenging labyrinth for the audience to make its way through. And even though we do find ourselves a bit confused over the minor details at times, the main storyline remains largely in focus, thanks primarily to Craig, who makes this latter-day Faust such a charismatic and compelling figure, and to Matthew Vaughn, the director, who keeps the action percolating along at an exciting clip.

32,Lejink,All in the mix...,7,29 November 2008,"Stylish, stylised if ultimately soul-less modern British gangster film, very much in the style of ""Pulp Fiction"" with its intricate plotting and circular-time narrative. As such it repays at least a second viewing, when you can see the bits fitting better and thus make all the various connections intended. From the brief slick title sequence onwards it's a film which keeps you watching as its numerous underworld characters are unfurled in a story really too complicated to go into but centring round Daniel Craig at its epicentre. Portrayed, unlike anyone else in the film, as an ""ordinary average"" criminal, who professes to hate guns, he nevertheless is so caught up in the maelstrom that he turns cold-blooded murderer before the credits roll. The rogues gallery of villains who enter Craig's orbit is the usual mix of borderline psychopaths and steely cool Mr Bigs but given life by some fine acting particularly Col Meaney as loyal henchman Gene, who dishes out a violent beating with the same detachment as filleting a fish and Michael Gambon, effing and blinding as the ""Misstra Know-It-All"" biggest shark in the sea. Craig is very good in the pivotal role, the soft centre of the cake if you will, who just when you think he's somehow come through it on top, if not unscathed, gets taken back down from an unexpected source - little fish can kill too. There are some excellent set pieces here, Craig's dispatching of his treacherous employer Jimmy on the latter's manicured, floodlit lawn is like a tableaux from a medieval ""Book of Hours"", Craig's run-in with the Serbian assassin when his own hit-man gets beaten to the punch and two beatings so savage (Meaney on Craig and Morty on Crazy Pete, the latter finished off, literally with a pot of tea) you almost have to turn your head away. In this man's man's man's world, there's not much room, as you'd expect, for women, but Sienna Miller gets a neat cameo as an underling's moll, who transfers affections to Craig, leading to an archly comic hotel seduction scene rudely interrupted by room-service. The direction is spot-on sharp, with too many camera tricks to mention, but the choice of the eclectic soundtrack (Rolling Stones, Kylie Minogue, The Cult), like in Scorcese's ""The Departed"" left me scratching my head as to its relevance to the plot or the characters. Even so, a fine UK film in its own right which hopefully will be remembered in the future for being more than the film that gave Daniel Craig his big break.",Layer Cake
33,paul2001sw-1,"Slick, cool, but less clever than it thinks",6,8 November 2008,"British gangster thrillers seem ten-a-penny, more common maybe than authentic British gangsters, and 'Layer Cake', while certainly entertaining, never manages (or even tries) to transcend the genre. The film's complex plotting requires a fair amount of exposition and directorial trickery, while the soundtrack drives the story but alienates the viewer from true empathy; and when the music gets spiritual, it feels misplaced in a movie that seems mostly concerned with it's own sense of cool. Daniel Craig isn't bad in the lead role, but it isn't quite clear if his character is meant to be rough playing smart, or vice versa; best of the cast is Michael Gambon, stealing every scene he appears in. It's a slick movie, but with none of the raw honesty of 'Get Carter' or 'The Long Good Friday'.",Layer Cake
34,MOscarbradley,One of the best British thrillers in ages,8,17 May 2007,"One of the best British gangster films in ages even if the plot is virtually indecipherable. Perhaps that's what makes it so good. It keeps throwing you curve-balls; it's not called ""Layer Cake"" for nothing. There are so many layers here it's hard to tell who's doing what to whom. Daniel Craig is the drugs dealer whose easy-going life on the pig's back is turned upside down and inside out when he gets involved as the middle-man in a very shady deal involving a million tabs of ecstasy and at the same time is asked, as a favour, to track down the missing daughter of Mr Big. The daughter scenario proves to be something of a red herring of which there are a lot in this movie, though Mr Big figures prominently.Adapted by J J Connolly from his own novel, (so fidelity is not an issue), and brilliantly directed by Matthew Vaughn it's the kind of picture that gives you a buzz if only for its bare-faced cheek. It's smart and clever and often very funny and it knows it. It wears its 'Goodfellas/Get Carter' credentials proudly. The cast, too, are terrific. Craig's casual insouciance is just about perfect. You should know from the offing that he's not as clued up as he thinks he is, but he is so winning and sexy you just don't see it or are prepared to forgive him anything. He's a villain but you identify with him because he's the most likable villain on screen and like him you are drip-fed the same information he's getting so you are never a step ahead of him nor he of you.And as old-time bad guys Michael Gambon and Kenneth Cranham are having a ball. Gambon, as the Mr Big character with the missing daughter, is magnificent. He gives an already good movie that extra lift and you just wish he were on screen more often. And the young turks ain't half bad either. If these wise-guys have watched too many Scorcese movies, so what; it's to their credit. If anyone wants to do a British version of ""The Sopranos"" they don't have to look further than here. Ultimately it may tick one too many boxes, but better that than ticking no boxes at all.

36,bowmanblue,A middle class Guy Ritchie film,9,31 January 2016,"Yes, Britain is famous for its classic and gritty gangster films (but then it's also got its fair share of pretty mundane and forgettable ones, too). Guy Ritchie made his name showing us the exploits of his working class (anti) heroes and, for a while, it seemed like every film was about the 'rougher' element from London. Then came Layer Cake. And, briefly, Ritchie's name was associated with it. You can see why. It does share certain traits of one of his films – gangsters, multiple plot lines and characters and, of course, the violence and double crossing.But, once you start watching it, you soon see that it's not just a poor clone, but something all of its own entirely. A pre-Bond Daniel Craig stars as the main character (of whom we deliberately never learn his name!) who is a class A drugs dealer, only not the type to hang round on dodgy street corners. He just produces the stuff for others to supply and snort, therefore he can tell himself (and us, the audience) that he's more of a respectable type of criminal.And, he's so respectable, that he's basically thinking of quitting the whole business (now that he's made his millions of course). Sadly, a very large spanner is thrown in his works when the local kingpin decides to utilise his services to find the missing daughter of a colleague. Now, this hardly fits in with Craig's usual skillsets, but then that's the point. It's all a bit too out of the blue to be above board. And, what follows is a chain reaction that leads to the afore-mentioned violence and double crossing.It's one of those films that you can't really have on in the background. You'll need to watch it. There are numerous characters who you'll need to keep track of so you can follow who's working for who and therefore who's about to stab who in the back. If you like your 'Richie-style' films then you should love this. Daniel Craig is excellent in the lead role (better than he is in Bond in my humble opinion) and the supporting cast all play their parts well. You'll only get the one chance to watch it through without knowing what's going to happen and I advice you sit down and spend some time getting to grips with it.Plus it's got a great soundtrack and Sienna Miller in – arguably – her finest role to date (*rolls eyes*).",Layer Cake

It's a high thrill ride from start to finish and it never slows down thanks to strong acting and a story that will have you nitpicking. I find this story nearly impenetrable and it's nice to see there are still films which do this.Matthew Vaughn's film is about a drug dealer named Mr. X who is on the eve of retirement from his life in drugs. But he gets forced to do two tough jobs and in the process, may result in someone being unhappy with Mr. X.The acting is one the strong points about the film. Daniel Craig gives a fresh take on portraying a London gangster and I really love how he incorporates the use of voiceovers in the film. Michael Gambon does a solid job as well. However, I could not find why Sienna Miller was even in this film since I find she's not essential to the story.Overall, this is a well-made and highly-complex film about gangsters and drugs.

38,CuriosityKilledShawn,The name is XXXX,7,18 August 2014,"I'd never heard of Daniel Craig pre-2004. Within a short space of time he starred in Enduring Love and this movie, and all of a sudden there was a new British leading man. But don't go thinking that he's a super-suave secret agent in Layer Cake. If anything XXXX is a bit of a helpless wimp when it comes to physicality.The unusual marketing for Layer Cake, featuring a yellow Land Rover with an iron scalding the hood, is what drew me in initially. I was worried that it would be horribly flamboyant in the vein of Guy Ritchie. Thankfully director Matthew Vaughn wanted to develop his own style and the resulting movie is much more refined and laid-back.XXXX is a coke dealer with low ambitions. He wants to make a neat fortune and escape into retirement. His boss Jimmy Price has fallen on hard times and manipulates XXXX into a compromising position between rival crime boss Eddie Temple, brash loudmouth wannabe gangster The Duke, and Serbian war criminal Slavo. If he is smart enough he just might be able to get out alive, get the money, and fool around with Sienna Miller.At 106 minutes Layer Cake is sharply edited and crams in loads of plot, more so than many movies much longer in length. It passes in a breeze and features a great soundtrack and a score by Lisa Gerrard. Ben Davis' anamorphic photography (in the now-defunct JDC-Scope) makes it all look very slick while somehow never drawing attention to itself.You can see how Craig got the Bond gig from his performance in this movie, but it is much more than a career stepping stone and seems to have been neglected by wider audiences in light of his more recent successes.",Layer Cake

40,tomgillespie2002,Rises above its imitators,7,23 September 2012,"This British gangster film was originally intended for director Guy Ritchie's typically heavy-handed approach, but thankfully, duty took him elsewhere and the gig landed in producer Matthew Vaughn's hands. Vaughn is now well-established amongst the Hollywood elite, having since gone on to direct the underrated Stardust (2007), the hugely entertaining Kick-Ass (2010), and the rather hit-and-miss X-Men: First Class (2011), but he made his name with this now-cult and extremely stylish little thriller that also paved the way for star Daniel Craig to become James Bond and an A-lister in one swoop. Vaughn's ability to stamp his quirky humour onto relatively familiar grounds is clear from the off, with Craig nameless protagonist (credited simply as XXXX) giving us the narration to his world, only this protagonist is about to get a massive life-lesson, and one that is quite suitable to our times.XXXX is a successful cocaine dealer who, along with his cohorts Gene (Colm Meaney), Morty (George Harris), Terry (Tamer Hassan) and Clarkie (Tom Hardy), is on the verge of making the big deal that could see his retirement. ""Have a plan, and stick to it,"" he tells us, only crime boss Jimmy Price (Kenneth Cranham) has different ideas. He sets XXXX the task of finding the daughter of larger crime lord Eddie Temple (Michael Gambon), a promising girl who has taken to drugs and since gone missing. Meanwhile, in Amsterdam, cocky gangster Duke (Jamie Foreman) has made a huge ecstasy heist but has stolen from the wrong person. All roads lead to XXXX, who finds himself pulled into a labyrinthine crime world where he starts to truly know his place.This world of loud-mouthed gangsters and powerful old men in expensive suits that London (and the UK film industry) seems to enjoy mixing itself up with is frankly tiresome and has been done to death (especially in the straight-to-DVD market). Yet Layer Cake has less of the colourful, wise-cracking cock-er-neys and slow-motion bloodshed of Guy Ritchie's back catalogue, and shares more with the sleek, neon-lit world of Michael Mann. Although it does quite often border on style- over-substance, and the multi-stranded plot is not quite as clever as it thinks it is, the film is funny, entertaining and frequently surprising. The final moments especially pull the rug from beneath you when you think everything is nicely wrapped up.The title refers to the social stratification of XXXX's world, and shows that it applies even to the criminal underworld, as well as business, social and political systems. XXXX thinks of himself as top dog, and in the opening scenes, we see him coolly going about his business - shades on, snappy suit, and he even takes the girl (Sienna Miller) of Duke's ridiculous nephew Sidney (Ben Whishaw). But his world, like our world, doesn't quite work like that. In the past year or so, we as the public have learned that we are mere cockroaches in a crushing capitalist country that vomits luxury onto the rich and powerful, and steals from the tax-payer. Like us, XXXX is chewed up by the system, giving him a slap-in-the-face dose of realism that he didn't see coming. The system is embodied by the towering Eddie Temple, in an effortlessly brilliant performance by a ridiculously fake-tanned Michael Gambon.

41,johnnyboyz,Layers of Goodness,10,3 October 2004,"I was really looking forward to seeing Matthew Vaughn's turn at directing a film and what better genre to see him make his debut in than the British gangster genre especially after his roles in the fabulous 'Lock,Stock...' and 'Snatch' even though they were Guy Ritchie's. Fans of those two movies may notice a few references in this one, most notably two of the actors used and some of the dialogue sounded fairly similar to a few lines out of 'Lock, Stock' but they didn't detract from the films quality. For a while, I thought I was watching 'Snatch' from a few years ago as the pace and the amount of characters that were piling up in the film was at times overwhelming. This may be the downside to many people's opinion of the film but I could cope. I realized the main characters, 'got to know them', and focused very much on them. Characters like 'The Duke' and 'Morty'; that way, I wasn't totally confused at first sight.The acting was good and there are moments which creep along silently that will have you on the edge of your seat. This included the factory in Amsterdam being robbed by 'The Duke' and his cronies as well as the scene during which our main character: 'XXXX' is pinned down in a park by a psychopathic Eastern European hit-man whilst on the phone to him.The acting is faultless and flows all the way through. When there are scenes which perhaps do go on longer than you'd like them to, the acting and dialogue just manage to keep them going to the end. The humour element is also there as I expected it would be. Most of the time they're 'chuckle to yourself' moments but there are two or three moments where you'll really find something funny and want to laugh out loud.Overall, it was great fun and a damn good film. I think it can just about stand it's self up there with Ritchie's two acts of brilliance as a result.I think you can tell; I enjoyed my piece.........",Layer Cake
42,TheMovieDiorama,Layer Cake energises London with an overstuffed yet vigorous gangster-driven story.,6,17 February 2020,"""The art of good business is being a good middleman"". XXXX. An anonymous criminal that has nothing to do with Diesel's high-octane spy shenanigans (xXx reference if you didn't get it...). A professional London cocaine distributor, narrating the tainted drug industry as if addicted himself. ""Good times today, stupor tomorrow"". Signifying the rise in recreational demand, with easy accessibility and affordability in the coming years. XXXX refuses to view himself as a gangster. Only a businessman. Reporting to a ruthless mob boss for two final tasks: track down an associate's drug addicted daughter, and oversee the purchase of one million ecstasy tablets. Taking a valorous step into the social hierarchy of the criminal underworld. The layer cake.Vaughn's punchy directorial debut can often be mistaken for an early Ritchie flick. With 'Snatch' and 'Lock, Stock' being clear inspirations for the feature's execution. And, let's face it, you wouldn't be incorrect. But that shouldn't be perceived as a detriment, as even the greats must source expression from somewhere. Vaughn consumes the narrative structure and memorable characterisation that Ritchie perfected, and injects his own vibrant synergy into the film. Think of it as low-fuelled heroin. From the café brawl, which is undoubtedly one of my favourite POV shots of all-time, to the betrayal revelation on top of a chaotically mid-constructed building.Vaughn's flavoursome vitality intelligently encompasses the surrounding mayhem of London, and concentrate its chaos into Connolly's characters (whom originally wrote the novel too). XXXX maintains a level of professionalism, even during times of desperation. Then you have the intimidating Jimmy Price, the street-wise ""Duke"", Eddie ""Dumbledore"" Temple and many, many others. The ""expansive"" list of characters was borderline endless, especially during the first half. Which seamlessly brings me to my primary criticism with Layer Cake. Characters are introduced in every direction, nearly every five minutes. Well over twenty supporting individuals in just one third! Consequently, this resulted in the story being quashed by the numerous character sub-plots that infiltrated the primary narrative. The hunt for Charlie and the purchase of pills took a backseat position in the initial half, mostly due to the unfocused juggling of entities.Fortunately the second half, after the revelatory betrayal, the plot becomes far more streamlined. Connolly's screenplay is brilliant throughout, with a plethora of memorable quotes one could recite daily. However, condensing his own dense novel into a mere hour and forty minutes, proved to be a difficult task with several characters garnering less screen time when really they should've been at the forefront. An example? Miller's Tammy for starters. Acting throughout was decent, with many conversations flowing organically. Various TV actors though were excessively shouting in an attempt to produce a commanding presence, but ultimately fell flat. In saying that, to end the entire ordeal on an ambiguous conclusion, as XXXX contemplates his uncertain fate, definitely created a haunting allurement well after the credits had rolled.Layer Cake may have more layers than a gangster's half-eaten wedding cake from CostCo, but remains sweet and filling enough to extinguish that rumbling starvation for Ritchie inspired grit.

46,Turfseer,"Convoluted plot, dialogue-heavy scenes and too many sub-plots spoil the broth",5,8 September 2010,"Here's a movie that I had to watch four times to basically understand what was going on. And I'm still not completely sure about all the details of the plot. Part of the problem was those thick British accents and all the local references which I was clueless about. Fortunately, I swallowed my pride and put on the English subtitles for my third and fourth viewings. Boy did that help! And the pithy Wikipedia plot summary also worked wonders!Layer Cake is based on J.J. Connolly's talky novel and you could say that the film version is dialogue heavy. Sometimes that's a good thing (the dialogue is very clever) but at other times, scenes seem a bit too long and draggy.We never learn the the name of the protagonist who's played by Daniel Craig (the character is referred to 'XXXX' in the credits—let's just call him 'Craig' for short). Craig reminds me very much of a modern-day Steve McQueen. He's a drug dealer who views himself as a businessman, not a thug. His supplier is the older gangster Jimmy Price who summons Craig to a ritzy club for lunch and demands that he find Charlotte, the drug addict daughter of Eddie Temple who's disappeared (Temple, another older gangster is far more sophisticated than the impulsive Jimmy). The search for the missing daughter is merely a sub-plot in the film; the main plot involves Jimmy ordering Craig to purchase a large amount of Ecstasy pills under the control of 'The Duke', a foul-mouthed psychopath who always has Slasher at his side, a nervous nilly of a girlfriend who always seems to be putting her foot in her mouth.Director Matthew Vaughn (who produced Guy Ritchie's 'Lock, Stock & Barrel') has made it a point that he wanted to make a 'serious' gangster picture and not copy Ritchie's style which often employs humor (mainly black comedy). Unfortunately, some of the characters in Layer Cake are unintentionally funny. Take for example Duke and Slasher fumbling for directions as they try to locate the Serbians' lair. And what about when Slasher loses control of her machine gun during the robbery and shoots one of the workers? Other instances of pure idiocy occur later in the film.I had a hard time believing that Duke and his hapless crew could so easily rip off the nasty Serbs (how exactly do they catch the Serbs by surprise?). And why doesn't The Duke simply kill the Serbians—they are supposed to be ruthless, aren't they? The Duke ends up falsely bragging on the street that Craig is connected with him and before you know it, the Serbians are after him too! Craig and his crew want to slap The Duke around for his indiscretion, but when they arrive at the boatyard where Duke's middleman was working on moving the purloined merchandise, they find the man dead, obviously the victim of the Serb's enforcer, the dark assassin, Dragan.I forgot to mention that Craig has already met Duke's gangster wannabe nephew and his sexy girlfriend, Tammy (Sienna Miller). The story begins to drag when Craig's hired associates find Charlotte's boyfriend, Kinky, dead up at the drug rehab facility (the scene could have been easily cut by a good ten minutes). And then there's Director Vaughn trying to imitate early Tarrantino when he has Craig's right hand man, Morty, stomp and scald low-life Freddie Hurst (Jimmy's right hand man, Gene, explains to Craig in a flashback that years ago, Freddie was responsible for Morty going to prison for ten years-- the bizarre tales involves a hoodlum committing suicide in a crowded restaurant, Morty being found with the body in the back of the van by the police after Freddie falls asleep as the getaway driver).More unintentional comedy occurs when Gene gives Craig a gun and Craig states, ""I hate f-cking guns"", only to deftly use it a short time later on. Sienna Miller has one short unconsummated sex scene with Craig who's suddenly kidnapped by Temple who plays him a recording proving that Jimmy is a police informer. More dumb criminals: Jimmy, it turns out, has been suckered into a bad investment by some African scam artists. In the most ludicrous scene in the entire movie, Craig somehow gains access to Jimmy's estate and murders him (how does he get past security?). Despite no longer having access to his laundered money (his accountant has flown the coop), Craig makes a deal with Eddie to sell him the stolen Ecstasy pills. Oh yes, more silly Tarrantino stuff: Jean beats Craig to a pulp for killing Jimmy but then forgives him after hearing the recording of Jimmy spilling the beans. Craig is as dumb as the rest when he convinces his Liverpool gang associates to lend him their hit man so they can ambush Dragan in a public park. Wouldn't you know it, but Dragan has been waiting for them all along and easily takes out the hit-man.The Layer Cake climax seems rushed (and not very 'layered'). The police end up confiscating the pills during a raid and Dragan lets Craig off the hook once he brings him Duke's decapitated head in a cooler (the Serbs aren't upset since they're now manufacturing gobs of Ecstasy pills). How does Eddie end up with the loot? I think two of Craig's associates manage to pilfer some in an armed robbery of a Serb courier (?). As for Craig, the gang wants to make him the new boss but just as he walks out, he's cut down by Sidney, the Duke's nephew, who's jealous that Craig has taken his girl.I'm afraid 'Layer Cake'has a few too many 'layers' for me. With its unnecessary subplots, gratuitous violence and convoluted plot that doesn't always make sense, I can't claim to be a big fan. On the other hand, I did enjoy trying to figure out what was going on. I guess that does count for something.",Layer Cake
47,freemantle_uk,A Very Good Crime Thriller,9,7 February 2009,"This was the film that made Daniel Craig into a star, and shows that Matthew Vaughan was a talented director.Layer Cake is a multi-layered, complex film, but is surprising easy to follow and a fairly short film: similar to a John Le Carre novel. The focus of the film is a successful middle-man cocaine dealer (Daniel Craig). He plans to retire young, but he is asked by his boss Jimmy (Kenneth Cranham) asks XXXX to find the missing drug addicted daughter of Edward Temple (Michael Gambon) and at the same time negotiate a large deal with a wannabe gangster The Duke (Jamie Foreman) who just stole one million ecstasy pills from some very angry Serbian gangsters. This leads XXXX in a dangerous world of treachery and double crossing and murder. This leads XXXX to doubt who to trust and what do to. As well, there are sub-plots involving a love-interest with Tammy (Sienna Miller) and XXXX's right hand man Monty (George Harris) gets revenge against the man who put him in prison.Layer Cake is based on a novel by J.J. Connolly, who wrote the screenplay. He shows he could write a complex film. Originally Guy Ritchie was due direct but he had to put out because of scheling conflicts. This was a blessing really because we all know that Ritchie would have just made Layer Cake a comical mockney fair. What Vaughen did was he played the material as straight as possible, keeping comedy to a minimum and a made an good example of a British Gangster film. Vaughen shows that he could handle the material and do some stylist directing trick like a pro, fitting in with the film. Vaughen assembled an excellent cast. Daniel Craig was brilliant and according to statements by Barbara Broccoli, this was the film that gave him the Bond gig. Michael Gambon was excellent, and they were good performances by Colm Meaney, George Harris, Jamie Foreman and Kenneth Cranham. Sienna Miller also shows she can act.

After about thirty minutes with this, though, the truth of the matter became painfully clear: Vaughn needs Ritchie just as much as Ritchie needs Vaughn. It's an unpolished picture, all twist and no character - the polar opposite of Ritchie's latest caper flick, ""RocknRolla."" Layer Cake's heart is in the right place, with a setup so familiar it may as well have come straight from the same brainstorming sessions that produced the duo's earlier collaborations. But try as it might, this film just can't manage to grant its players the same kind of mettle that was so present in those preceding pictures. They're lifeless before running into a violent end, going through the motions but lacking the conviction to make their words feel authentic. And there are no less than three dozen of them, many of whom are on screen for less then ten minutes, playing major off-camera roles amidst all of the twisting and the turning.

49,alindsay-al,An Average film filtered with good performances,5,6 September 2014,"Now I am a big fan of gangster films like this but I thought this was a pretty average film to be honest. This sees the character XXXX a drug dealer about to retire sent out on one last job that ends up being much larger then he could ever imagine. Now this was before Daniel Craig was James Bond and you can clearly see why they thought he was perfect for that role. He is great in this film and is the largest strength for the film as his character plays this flawed character that has his human characteristics that makes him easily connectable to the audience. Also the majority of the supporting cast is really good as well with the rest of his crew all having really good moments in the film. I also believe Michael Gambon was really good in the film for when he was in it, even though I thought Sienna Miller was very underutilized. Now a really weak part in this film is the story, it is so convoluted and made little sense throughout the film. There was also just too many small stories going on and they took away from the whole film, and also the end of this film just sucks. The script is usually a driving force in films like this but its only okay in this film as lots of lines aren't delivered that well but okay and is alright.

50,estebangonzalez10,Vaughn's directorial debut and Craig's breakthrough role,7,4 May 2013,"¨Always remember that one day all this drug monkey business will all be legal. I'm not a gangster. I'm a businessman whose commodity happens to be cocaine.¨Layer Cake is the film that made Hollywood turn its eyes on Daniel Craig to become the next James Bond. Despite playing an anti-villain in this film, he displayed several qualities that we actually see in some of his recent roles as Bond. If it weren't for Layer Cake, I can't imagine Craig being considered for the role. But Layer Cake wasn't just a breakout role for Daniel Craig; this was also Matthew Vaughn's directorial debut. Vaughn who had previously produced some of Guy Ritchie's work including Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch was heavily influenced by his directing style and Layer Cake is living proof of that. After the success Vaughn had with this film he went on directing different projects like Stardust, Kick-Ass, and X-Men First Class, which in my opinion were superior to Layer Cake. In Layer Cake I felt, Vaughn took a lot of things from the British criminal genre that Ritchie made famous, but in his next movies he was able to break free and try new things. That doesn't mean I didn't have a good time with this crime thriller, but I felt like it didn't stand out from the rest of the films in this genre besides Craig's superb performance. The film requires its audience to play close attention to the story because several things are happening at once and at times I felt the pace of the film was a bit rushed. There were way too many things going on to fit everything in a 100 minute movie. The screenplay was based on J.J. Connolly's successful novel.The story centers on a cocaine dealer who considers himself a businessman and not a gangster. He's working as sort of a middle man between the underground wholesalers and street dealers. He's not named, but the credit roles call him XXXX (Daniel Craig). XXXX is a very intelligent and cautious businessman who knows what he's doing, but happens to work for very dangerous people who sometimes get him into trouble. He's planning on retiring from the business, but before he can do so his boss, Jimmy Price (Kenneth Cranham) asks him to locate Charlotte Ryder (Nathalie Lunghi), who happens to be the daughter of another powerful underground mob leader named Eddie Temple (Michael Gambon). XXXX works alongside with Gene (Colm Meaney) and Morty (George Harris) who watches his back, but he also has two other employees who work for him: Clarkie (Tom Hardy) and Terry (Tamer Hassan). Everything gets complicated for XXXX when a group of junkies steal two million pounds worth of ecstasy pills from a wholesaler named Dragan (Dragan Micanovic) and he's forced to find and give back the drugs. The person who stole the drugs is Duke (Jamie Foreman), and he's not willing to give them back. While Duke's hiding out, XXXX encounters his nephew and ends up falling for his girlfriend, Tammy (Sienna Miller), making matters even worse. XXXX will soon find out that the British mob is like a cake which consists of several different layers.The film has so many characters and different thing going on at the same time that it's very difficult to follow everything. Layer Cake is a bit too complicated and messy, but it is still a great crime thriller in which Daniel Craig gives a very solid performance. The rest of the characters don't get too much screen time. Sienna Miller is much underused here and her character doesn't bring much to the film. I love Tom Hardy as well but he has almost nothing to work with here and goes unnoticed as well. Michael Gambon and Colm Meaney give the best supporting performance in my opinion, but the rest of the cast is totally forgettable. We've seen many crime thrillers and this one doesn't stand out from the rest. It is above average but nothing groundbreaking in my opinion. I love Vaughn's films, but this is probably my least favorite film of his. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Layer Cake
51,noralee,"Gritty, Twisty Brit Gangster Film For the Mind, Eye and Ear",8,30 May 2005,"""Layer Cake"" fulfills the stylishly gritty Brit gangster film tradition from ""The Long Good Friday"" to ""Sexy Beast"" through ""The Long Firm"" mini-series.Debut director Matthew Vaughn has learned his lesson from producing Guy Ritchie films like ""Snatch"" to not let the flashy techniques dominate the story. He's helped that J.J. Connolly adapted the twisty screenplay from his novel, and the stylishness inventively communicates visually the complicated exposition of intertwining generations of competing criminals in flashbacks, simultaneous activities and strategic ""Rashomon"" angles for coy release of information as manipulatively needed.Like the out-law side of the TV series ""The Wire,"" a la ""Stringer Bell,"" the film looks at post-""Godfather"" lessons of drug dealing criminal enterprise through the bureaucratic eyes of ""the New Breed"" as an intelligence meritocracy who see themselves as Prohibition middleman entrepreneurs who just happen to have ruthless methods of enforcing market prices. Even with the heavy Brit accents, slang and legal references American audiences can follow the details of the plot through the context, though I assume that's what's keeping it in art houses instead of in the multiplexes.Vaughn takes wonderful advantage of Daniel Craig's magnetic blue eyes (it's hard to resist calling them the cliché piercing) and protean body language that can change with his outfit (or hunky lack of it). Craig incorporates but now goes beyond the street smart alcoholic cops he could have gotten stuck playing on TV shows.Part of the shiftiness of the action (and judging by murmured predictions in the audience all got as fooled scene by scene either by the what or the who or the why as the gob-smacked characters) is due to playing on our assumptions about characters if we relax into thinking they are stereotypes, from masterminds to enforcers, thanks to a marvelous cast of character actors.Visual jokes pop up throughout, like a close-up of a copy of ""Dante's Inferno"" in a king pin's library, a negotiation in a gentleman's club and the ironically titular dessert at the center of a celebratory meal, to keep the very cynical humor going when the going gets bloody.While the score by Ilan Eshkeri and Lisa Gerrard is very propulsive, the British pop song selections, even in the background as helping to establish flashback periods, are choice.",Layer Cake

That's it. Anyone who says it is anything more is missing the point of this chick flick. It's meant to depress young men, period. It's the same Hollywood hate formula we see over and over. New names are added to the mix of the demonic Nazi machine, and it's obvious the writer and director idolize Adolf Hitler, and want to keep his spirit alive. To be honest, this demonic spirit was in effect long before Hitler. He was just another part of it. It's not natural, but these human monsters possessed by the Nazi demon want to keep preaching that it is.The movie is just another bit of Hollywood Nazi preaching, and overkill.

""XXXX"" (""if you knew my name, you'd be as clever as me"") is no stranger to the underworld, but he is neither a thug or a professional hard man - in fact, he doesn't even own a gun. So once things go wrong, his involvement with the criminal types - who routinely employ violence, torture and murder as means to an end - is fraught with far more suspense and anxiety than the ""Goon Show"" aura of a film like ""Snatch"". As a consequence, the stakes feel considerably higher than in those fine Guy Ritchie films...death isn't just a payoff to a slapstick scene with guns and goons, it is very possible and very real.I liked this film a LOT. The Brits continue to show everyone else just how to be interesting on camera without overacting or chewing the scenery. The movie packs on the machismo and revels in the outlaw's contempt for the ""straight"" world without ever losing track of the menace and danger of the outlaw way of life. The plot is full of twists and turns and may take more than one viewing to take in, which is good for movie fans who like their films ""chewy"". Part of my problem may have been that the accents are pretty thick, and I had trouble catching some of the lines which may have held important info as to what (and why) events were happening on screen. No problem, I'll just watch it again (gladly) with subtitles turned on.A word about Daniel Craig - I don't want to get too enthused about him too early based on one role, but I like his ""McQueen""-ish style and his intriguing ""stillness"" in this movie. He's good enough in this that I will go see the next film he has a major part in (including, possibly a Bond film) and see if he's still that good.While the cheap irony of the ending irritated me somewhat (I'll have to go read the novel now to see how the author treated this), I think this was a great, lean, mean , cool gangster film.

However, big boss Jimmy Price hands down a tough assignment: find Charlotte Ryder, the missing rich princess daughter of Edward, a powerful construction business player and gossip papers socialite. Complicating matters are two million pounds' worth of ecstasy, and a whole series of double crossings.Here is a British gangster movie that will automatically be compared to Guy Richie film's Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, even though this movie is something of it's own. Where Richie's films were more of a comedic tone, Layer Cake takes itself more seriously, which is why you must pay attention to what is shown to you on the screen.Matthew Vaughn take special care with the translation to screen from JJ Connelly's novel. Here we see that he has an eye for great crime/gangster movies. One particular scene will stay in my mind as one of the most memorable scene's in any gangster movie. When Morty is beating the crap out of Frankie in the diner, while the music Ordinary World by Duran Duran is playing in the background. Beautiful camera work, editing, music all blending perfectly together to give you a raw emotional and jaw dropping scene.The music throughout the entire film is perfectly suited for the style. Right from the beginning we get ""She Sells Sanctuary"" with the guitar stringing cords played beautifully, the music prepares you for the intense film you are about to see. Every piece of music used in Layer Cake fits that scene perfectly, great ears were put to use here.Colm Meaney plays the same type of character in a lot of movies, a p'd off ""I can kill you whenever I want"" attitude...and he pulls it off differently every time. Daniel Craig, while I was introduced to him in Tomb Raider, shows what he can actually do in with his talent, and those freaky blue eyes. His character, who's name is never mentioned can be the next 007. The only thing that I didn't like about the his character, was that he fell in love with this girl, who he just met. To me that seemed rather sudden and random.The movie's plot is clichéd, a bad guy will do one last deal, before quitting, but gets pulled into a twisting plot of bad things. Yes, we've seen these bad thing happen before in numerous movies, but this movie pulls it off with style and shock value, I was ""shocked"" twice during this film. When the sniper, out of no where gets sniped from Dragon. That was totally unexpected and worked so well. Of course the ending as well, which again comes out of nowhere. Ironic how throughout the whole movie XXXX believes that his job, dealing with drugs and what-not would be the reason behind him dying, and yet it's a woman. Not saying that he dies, this is left unanswered, he does get shot, be we never see him die, so his death is debated by the many fans of the film, who indeed hope for a sequel.What else is there to say besides the fact that this movie is not only stylish, but it's ultra cool. It's a different take on British crime from a Guy Richie movie, but a step up from the film Gangster No.1. Layer Cake take twists and turns left right and centre, and for once in a blue moon, they actually make sense. So pick it up, because this film has more then one layer to it itself.",Layer Cake

There's an excellent mixture of fear in his character's actions/dialogue which is well placed earning believability. His adventure is a good one. The supporting cast, on the whole English produce polished snappy dialogue with cool, collected energy. The editing is fast paced, but thankfully the director has chosen a fairly linear storyline. Some movies these days try to push the novelty too far in messing with time sequencing to where its a distraction. This movie does not. I thought the movie was especially strong in the beginning to draw interest. The only 2 Nit-picks for me were the very ending which was a bit too much and the fact that there is perhaps a bit too many characters for the 100 min or so to support. These of course are minor. Layer Cake is a polished well done movie with a good lead character definitely worth a look.",Layer Cake
59,lewiskendell,Another fine British crime film.,8,20 March 2010,"I've seen a number of these British crime movies lately, and they all seem to be consistently good. Layer Cake is less-stylized than some of its peers, but its great cast and well-layered (pun intended) plot are more than enough to make it as good as any of the others that I have seen. Daniel Craig is the star of the show, and his performance here makes me want to watch  more of his pre-Bond movies. He really is a great actor with a pretty diverse range. And  I've never seen Sienna Miller this blindingly sexy before. I wanted to see much, much  more of her. The plot is suitably twisty and never dull, so fans of these kinds of movies  are likely to be as pleased with Layer Cake as I was. It's the kind of movie that starts off strong and finishes even stronger.",Layer Cake
60,brando647,Awesome British Gangster Flick from Ritchie's Former Producer,8,23 February 2012,"After a few years of establishing his awesomeness as Guy Ritchie's producer for his hits LOCK, STOCK and SNATCH, Matthew Vaughn realized it was his turn to shine and popped into the director's chair for his debut in 2004. Before he'd go on to direct KICK-ASS and X-MEN: FIRST CLASS, he burst onto the scene with LAYER CAKE. Now, the movie never really saw any mainstream success in the United States and the only reason it caught on with me is because I'd been working at a Blockbuster Video (remember those?) that year and spotted it when it arrived as a new release. Having been a fan of Guy Ritchie's work and noting that Vaughn had worked on both his early hits, I'd grabbed it and discovered a new director whose work I knew I'd have to follow. Vaughn didn't venture too far outside his previous experience and followed in the vein of Ritchie's British underworld motif. Based on the novel of the same name, LAYER CAKE follows a nameless cocaine processor/dealer played by Daniel Craig. Intelligent and cool-headed, he's saved a nice nest egg and he's ready to retire from the business but his employer has a couple final requests for him. He's asked to mediate a deal of one million ecstasy pills that have found their way to London, and in the meantime he's asked to track down the missing daughter of his employer's friend. Of course, there's a lot his employer hasn't told him and he becomes involved in a clusterf*** that could end with a bullet to his head.This movie has all the flavor of your usual Guy Ritchie underworld action movie but with more flair. Ritchie's movies had a sort of gritty, gloomy vibe as their main characters were bumbling about in the midst of some serious heat and just hoping to get out alive. Vaughn's unnamed protagonist (listed in the end credits as XXXX) is smarter than your average Ritchie hero. He's in some serious crap too, but he's scheming to make sure he comes out on top. Vaughn's underworld is a lot flashier and more attractive. Vaughn's criminals are sulking in slums and alleys; they're making deals in country clubs and penthouses. It's big business. Still, these are bad men who aren't afraid to get their hands dirty. There's a lot of what we loved in Ritchie's movies present here, thanks to Vaughn and author/screenwriter J.J. Connolly: violence, drugs, underhand dealings, corruption, and a charismatic anti-hero to lead the way. No criminals are more interesting and fun to watch than British criminals, or at least that's what movies have taught me. If you enjoyed LOCK, STOCK and SNATCH, then LAYER CAKE is definitely for you. Vaughn ha proved himself a talented director and this is more than impressive for a breakout movie. I really wish this movie had gotten more attention on this side of the Atlantic, but most people I mention it to aren't familiar with it.The cast is a perfect mix of heavy-hitters, strong supporters, and even boasts a few big names before they broke into the mainstream. LAYER CAKE was my first exposure to Daniel Craig (I'd forgotten he was in TOMB RAIDER a few years prior, but let's be honest: there's only one thing anyone remembers about TOMB RAIDER and it isn't Craig) and it was the reason why I totally excited for his casting as the new James Bond for CASINO ROYALE in 2005. The man oozes cool. He's joined by a young Tom Hardy and Colm Meaney in his crew. Meaney is awesome. Between his tough guy turn in LAYER CAKE and his hilarious role in GET HIM TO THE Greek, I have to wonder why he doesn't get more mainstream work. The man is so much cooler than I ever thought he'd be when watching him on ""Star Trek The Next Generation"". Kenneth Cranham and Michael Gambon are the crime bosses treating Daniel Craig as the pawn in their little game, and Sienna Miller brings the sexy. There's even a few Ritchie regulars popping up in minor roles (Jason Flemyng and Dexter Fletcher). Aside from Craig, there aren't a lot of names that the general American public will recognize and I'm sure that hurt any chance of distribution over here. LAYER CAKE is an awesome gangster film, probably one of my favorites. It may not have gotten the attention it deserved but I'm glad to see Matthew Vaughn has skyrocketed into a position as one of coolest directors working in Hollywood.",Layer Cake

62,sme_no_densetsu,A worthy addition to the British gangster film canon,8,25 September 2008,"The director of ""Layer Cake"", Matthew Vaughn, acted as producer of the Guy Ritchie hits ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch"". This film covers much of the same ground, though with a slightly different approach that harks back to earlier British films like ""The Long Good Friday"". In that respect, it's a nifty little crime flick likely to be appreciated by fans of the genre.Vaughn's approaches are somewhat similar to Guy Ritchie in that they both toy with narrative structure and inventive camera-work. However, Vaughn (in his first directorial effort) is not quite as successful as Ritchie in either area. Consequently, the film has a bit of a convoluted feel as we follow the story's zig-zagging path to its conclusion.The acting is capably executed with Daniel Craig in the spotlight portraying a nameless cocaine dealer on the verge of retirement (there's always one last job, isn't there?). The rest of the cast is peppered with familiar faces like Michael Gambon, Colm Meaney, Sally Hawkins & Tom Hardy, some of them in small roles at an early stage of their careers.As stated previously, the storyline is somewhat convoluted, which seems to be a combined fault of the screenwriter and the director. Nevertheless, it's an engaging story told with a certain amount of verve. While many of the techniques employed by Vaughn are mere imitations of better work by other directors the complete package is not by any means unattractive.So, for those who enjoy films about the exploits of gangster lowlifes this is an easy recommendation, particularly if you're fond of British examples of the genre (like the movies of Guy Ritchie). As for others, your mileage may vary.",Layer Cake
63,leftbanker-1,Loaded with Great Characters,9,24 June 2018,"Just about everyone in this movie could walk out of it and have a decent movie built solely around them. With that said, I think there were a few too many characters. I know this is the whole point of the ""layer cake"" but I would have preferred that there be about one less guy at the top. Constantly trading up to bigger bosses deflected the focus from the peril. One moment a guy is the big cheese and the next he isn't. The dreaded Serbs aren't all they are cracked up to be, which was a real shame.Still, there are few films as slick as Layer Cake. It was a bit much of a Tarantino wannabe, but enjoyable.",Layer Cake
64,KUAlum26,"Cool ""gangster"" movie",8,23 May 2007,"Actually,this movie is much less a ""gangster"" movie in that,even though there are organized criminals here,it works more as a sort of crime caper centered around drug runners,nearly all of whom are working at a more selfish,singular level. I have yet to see(please suspend your gasps of disbelief)Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,but what I know about that film and after seeing this film,I kinda feel like Layer Cake might be a slightly lower energy companion-piece/counterpart to Lock Stock.Mr.X(DAniel Craig,in what is said to be the role that clinched his getting to be the next James Bond)may deal in contraband,but you know right away that at heart,he views himself as merely a businessman. A very VERY successful businessman. But even at that,he still knows he wants out of the business,and is about to get to do just that until his boss/financier puts upon him the task to find a rival crime lord's missing,runaway daughter. To compound matters,it seems that some associates of X's have managed to swipe a large and valuable stash of Ecstacy that is being wanted back by a vicious Croatian drug lord. When the rival crime lord(Michael Gambon)wants to buy away the amount of Ecstasy that is somewhere in his asoscate's possession,the pressure is on for Mr.X to deliver the goods and not get killed in the process.While the architecture of this film's plot(i.e. what happens to whom and when)feels a little muddled and the skittish speaking from some lesser characters is a trifle tough to understand,this is still the mark of a well-executed,cool movie. Craig's performance alone makes this a watchable,intriguing story. He's able to be both tough,cool,and yet incurably vulnerable and normal. Solid supporting turns from Colm Meaney(as X's sub-boss),George HArris(as X's peer),Jamie Foreman,Sally HAwkins(as the unstable loose-cannon's of X's outfit) and Dragan Micanovich(quietly menacing as the Serbian drug lord)compliment Craig's leading,nameless character. The move to make the main character an anonymous figure with not much back story is probably the film's best move,making him a presence of the her-and-now,whose morality,integrity,past and future all in doubt,thus keeping the story lean and ticking. It's probably not nearly as kinetic as stuff like Lock Stock...,Snatch or Trainspotting,but it doesn't need to be. This was a free rent for me,but I suspect I would've paid to rent this if I'd been more aware of this movie when it was first released. Not a favorite of mine but not a waste of time,either.",Layer Cake
65,seymourblack-1,Heading For A Fall,7,29 September 2017,"A London drug dealer who regards himself as a businessman rather than a criminal, operates by a set of rules that he believes will enable him to retire shortly with the huge amount of money that he's accumulated. With a letting agency as his front and an accountant who systematically launders his money, he's convinced that he knows exactly what he's doing and says that ""life's so good, I can taste it in my spit"". In reality, however, because he's oblivious to the true levels of treachery that routinely permeate every layer of the criminal hierarchy within which he works; he's heading for a fall.The dealer (Daniel Craig) whose name is never mentioned in the movie and is listed in the credits as XXXX unwittingly reaches a pivotal moment in his career when his boss Jimmy Price (Kenneth Cranham), calls him to a luncheon meeting and gives him two jobs to carry out. One is to find the missing drug-addicted daughter of his long-time associate, Eddie Temple (Michael Gambon) and the other is to acquire and sell the one million ecstasy pills that are currently in the hands of a low-level gangster called ""The Duke"" (Jamie Foreman). It's from this point onwards that everything starts to unravel for XXXX as he discovers that the ecstasy pills had been stolen from a gang of Serbians who've sent a ruthless hit-man called Dragan (Dragan Micanovic) to recover their property and also to eliminate anyone who's involved. This puts XXXX in immediate danger because the Serbians had been given the impression by The Duke that he had been working for XXXX.After he's surprisingly kidnapped by Eddie Temple's men, XXXX learns that, as well as having had an ulterior motive for wanting Eddie's daughter to be found, Jimmy was also involved in a major act of betrayal against his own criminal fraternity and a plan to relieve XXXX of all of the money he'd made as a drug dealer. Further revelations, betrayals and an act of revenge then follow before the full extent of XXXX's downfall suddenly becomes apparent.""Layer Cake"" is a complicated, character-heavy crime drama that's full of double-crosses, clever twists and dry humour. It's based on the novel of the same name by J.J. Connolly and in adapting it for the big screen, he's retained so many of the story's minor characters and subplots that the end-result is more involved than it needs to be and as a result, fails to consistently convey to its audience what is important and what isn't. First-time director Matthew Vaughn does a good job of injecting clarity, vitality and stylishness into the whole undertaking and its large cast of talented actors also do well with Daniel Craig, Michael Gambon and Kenneth Cranham providing the most powerful and memorable performances. Overall, the movie is gritty, violent and lacks any likable characters but its soundtrack is well above average with especially good use being made of tracks by The Cult, The Rolling Stones and Duran Duran.",Layer Cake

It's the typical British gangster movie, violent and funny as well, and shows the usual types of Guy Ritchie's stories. Gives a view of UK drug underworld and, though a plot that is not very original (truth be told), it's certainly stylish and riveting. Daniel Craig, the future James Bond, is certainly the best in this flick but also the other performances are fairly convincing. The film stars Sienna Miller but she appears for a very short time;last but not least, the English accent is really difficult to understand.",Layer Cake
67,hall895,Lots of layers? Yes. Lots of entertainment? Not so much.,6,23 September 2005,"As the title would suggest Layer Cake has a lot going on. Just when you think you've got something figured out you discover the next layer and the story goes off in another direction. It seems there's always something hidden under the surface that will eventually lead you to rethink what you're seeing at the moment. But all the twists and turns can't hide the fact that at heart it's a really simple, unoriginal and only moderately entertaining story.Daniel Craig plays the lead character, a nameless London cocaine dealer. Call him XXXX because, well, that's what the credits call him. Anyhow, XXXX has the business down to a science, minimizing risk all along the way. And now he is looking to get out of the cocaine business but things are never that simple. His boss, Jimmy, orders him to sort out a massive, complicated ecstasy deal and while he's at it find the wayward coked-out missing daughter of Jimmy's boss. Two tasks which will prove to be fraught with the types of risk XXXX would much prefer to avoid. And here the layers start to peel away and the film threatens to careen completely off track. Seemingly major characters disappear, seemingly minor characters take on great importance and seemingly everybody is hiding something. At times it's rather difficult to get your bearings with XXXX being the only thing holding all this together.Craig's performance as XXXX is a good one and it has to be as all the many strands running through the film eventually lead to him one way or another. Outside of Craig only Colm Meaney as another gangster, Gene, really stands out. All the other characters come and go and the actors playing those roles don't have much to work with. The story is all over the place and threatens to collapse upon itself. A few less layers and much more concise storytelling surely would have helped. It all adds up to a decent effort, highlighted by Craig's fine performance. But there is surely a sense that this could have been something a whole lot better.",Layer Cake
68,phubbs,Layer Cake,7,30 July 2015,"Along with Guy Ritchie, Matthew Vaughn is the probably the second biggest director from the UK at the moment with some huge films under his belt, he is also the British gangster film maker of our modern age along with Mr Ritchie having made 'Lock Stock' and 'Snatch' together.Those two films pretty much flash started the British gangster/underworld flicks back into being and created a whole load of copies in film style and imagery. 'Layer Cake' is Vaughn's attempt without his partner in crime (pun intended) and you can obviously see how that collaboration has rubbed off on him.The film is pretty much like 'Lock Stock' and 'Snatch' and could almost be the third in a trilogy really, the plot is a hotpot of subplots wrapped around one main plot which all intertwine and work off each other well. Although its very familiar by now in visuals, dialog and concept its still somehow good fun to watch hardcases, fumbling crooks and foul mouthed crime lords all batter each other trying to get money/drugs/women/guns etc...one or the other.It really is nothing new after the last two big Ritchie films it has to be said with virtually the same cast yet again, bar Vinnie Jones, the same outcomes and the same kind of violence all topped off with outrageously harsh cockney accents. Craig fits in quite well with this world as the well spoken sensible dealer and he does a good job unlike his usual wooden pouting performances, you do want him to win the day and its nice to see someone play a role in these types of films without a whole load of attitude and mouth.Don't expect anything new to the genre with this as its the same again from Vaughn but its neater, tighter and not as ludicrous as the previous big two Brit gangster flicks, its still a lairy little sod of flick though, bosh! 7/10",Layer Cake
69,Stampsfightclub,Craig shines in good gangster film,7,24 November 2009,"Wanting to get out of the drugs business a dealer (Craig) is roped in further to help a fellow gangster locate the whereabouts of a missing girl.Lock, stock and two smoking barrels, Snatch and many Ian Fleming James Bond adaptations have been viewed around the world for many years and each has their own elegant portrayal of the gritty British crime scene.Guy Ritchie's films epitomise the use of drugs, robbery and fighting where the Bond films reflect a more outlandish portrayal with a heavier use of action agenda to get a glorified representation of villains across to the world, now being world based since the first release all those years ago.So, how does Layer Cake compare with these renowned beauties of the crime genre? For starters it has the beginning of them all as Daniel Craig's unnamed protagonist narrates the sequence as he walks around a futuristic styled shop where drugs are packaged under a popular brand being sold to any recipient. A horrifying prospect yet somewhat glorified in this instance and soon we are right at the heart of more controversial drug concepts as Craig wades through his story whilst other characters have their say.Of course there have been numerous other drug related films released over the years. Goodfellas is arguably the best American film to adapt the issue whilst none are more poignant from Britain than Danny Boyle's Trainspotting. Bearing in mind those two films have other issues to resolve in their respected scripts, going into this film with a fresh approach is desirable.The ball is already rolling at high speed with Craig's eccentric presence dominating the early stages as he explains to the viewer how he goes about his job, how it's important to know the right people and the simple fact that at the end of the day, he wants to retire and have a nice home in the country. Alarm bells ring and he is soon wrapped up in trying to find a runaway drug addict and her boyfriend. This allows the film to develop more of a high octane underlining feel as guns, women and rivalries start to filter to the surface. Vaughn allows us to see enough to get our minds attached to the feel of the situation the central character is involved but the tension elapses in face to face confrontations. The garden scene late at night is actually pretty terrible for the characters to know better. There is a slight apprehension in the overall conclusion, given what the character has let himself in for. But the final act was completely unnecessary and hindered so much on my personal outlook of the film as a whole. Such an ending dos not generate the feeling of sorrow it intended, which is a shame.What is a major let down in this film, and many other gangster films, is the inclusion of a multitude of characters. Having so many names and faces makes us lost in awe at the vastness of the crime world and the plot loses its footing because of it. This is a good film but could have been great.",Layer Cake
70,fwomp,Layers Aren't Enough,6,6 April 2007,"Plans within plans within plans. That best describes LAYER CAKE, director Matthew Vaughn's (SNATCH) crime-drama about a man with no name who's need to get out of the drug running business leads him to a surprising end.Daniel Craig (CASINO ROYALE) stars as XXXX (he has no official name but one can surmise that it may have to do with a Faustish character). He wants out of his illegal drug profession but is swept back into play by a large market intro of ecstasy by a wacked-out guy named the Duke (Jamie Foreman). XXXX's boss orders him to meet with the Duke and to find out what happened to a friend's daughter who'd disappeared with her boyfriend.Come to find out, XXXX's boss is out to pull a fast one on this supposed friend with the missing daughter by kidnaping her himself (should XXXX find her) and forcing a showdown that'll allow his boss sole access to the street-bound ecstasy.But an additional layer of deceit quickly gets piled on as we learn that the Duke stole the ecstasy from a very nasty character called Dragan. Dragan is not to be messed with, killing anyone or anything that gets in his way. We never see Dragan but only hear his ominous voice or the back of his head.Another layer is added as XXXX learns that his boss is actually a police informant and Craig's character is forced to kill him in order to survive  something that wreaks havoc on XXXX's sleep and psyche ...for a while.XXXX's friends Gene (Colm Meaney) and Morty (George Harris) act as grounding forces that keep XXXX in line, until he kills their boss and Gene is forced to thrash him in order to get the truth from him.The final layer involves a sort of femme fatale named Tammy (Sienna Miller, CASANOVA) whom XXXX becomes infatuated with and will unknowingly bring about his downfall in the most ironic of circumstances (not having to do with drugs or money at all).An entertaining if overly drawn-out layering of plots that sometimes feel forced or contrived and other times hitting their mark, Layer Cake is an interesting look at Daniel Craig just prior to his rise to the 007 ranks.Personally, I prefer director Vaughn's aforementioned Snatch and his now cultish LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS to this flick. It's engaging enough to be interesting, but not much more.",Layer Cake
71,Benjamin-M-Weilert,Hints of Vaughn's and Craig's future successes.,4,9 May 2020,"I always find it interesting to go back and watch breakout films by directors who would come into their own years later. In the case of Matthew Vaughn, I have enjoyed his work, which includes Stardust (2007), Kick-Ass (2010), X-Men: First Class (2011), and the Kingsman franchise. With Layer Cake (2004), I could see the kind of filmmaker he would become-with plenty of neat visual tricks-but there's so much that's lacking polish that I'm not even sure what happened in this movie. I kind of got the general sense of the plot, but I found myself lost by what was happening by the end of it all.Perhaps part of my problem is that the action is quite loud, but the dialogue is all quiet. I kept having to adjust the volume on my surround sound as a result. Maybe I should have put subtitles on because I had trouble understanding what most of the characters were saying through their thick English accents. Still, this movie had a lot of scenes that were-for lack of a better term-just there. I hate any movie that does close-up camera work of someone sloppily eating with their hands, even if that character receives their comeuppance in a randomly violent event only minutes later.I will attest that Daniel Craig's performance was quite exemplary, and is likely the reason why he was cast as James Bond 15+ years ago. If anything, Layer Cake should be seen as Craig's resume for the iconic Bond character. In the end, this film isn't wholly un-redeemable; it just felt unnecessary. Sure, every director should start somewhere, but maybe we don't always have to go back and see where they started. We might end up disappointed with the result since we expect the refined work that drew us to these directors in the first place.Hints of Vaughn's and Craig's future successes, I give Layer Cake 2.0 stars out of 5.",Layer Cake

73,gregsrants,Ultra Cool Classic,8,6 June 2005,"Seven years ago, I sat in a movie theatre with little to no expectations for the viewing of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, a British crime/comedy/drama from producer Michael Vaughn. I had never heard of the director (the future Mr. Madonna, Guy Ritchie) and there wasn't a single cast member that I could say I had seen before.A few years later, Vaughn was back producing another Guy Ritchie film that put American actors Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro and Dennis Farnia amongst all the chaos in the British underground in Snatch.Despite the low fanfare (they have since become cult hits), both movies were refreshingly fun flicks that ended up on my top ten lists in their respective years of release.Now, five years since Snatch made a splash on North American soil, producer Michael Vaughn is back, this time behind the lens, for the new crime thriller, Layer Cake.Layer Cake follows a cocaine dealer without a name played by Daniel Craig who is working towards his retirement from the underground biz. He doesn't see himself as a bad man. In fact, his voice over reveals that he is not a gangster. He's a business man. However, if Carlito's Way taught us anything it is that escape from a lifetime in the seedy crime world is not easy to dissolve oneself of.And things start to go amok immediately when crime boss Jimmy Price (Kenneth Cranham) forcefully delegates the task of finding the lost daughter of an old powerful friend to our protagonist. Reluctantly, but without option, the job is accepted and this begins the wicked spiral deeper into the drug and criminal underworld than he had ever hoped to venture.Soon, there will be a drug trade gone bad, an introduction to a character named Dragon who lops off the heads of his victims, friends who will both have a drink with you and kick the living life out of your body in the same afternoon and enough crosses, double crosses and screw-you's to keep you riveted to the screen.Much like Lock, Stock and Snatch, there are enough characters in Layer Cake to keep your head spinning. Vaughn doesn't try and spell things out for the audience and throws the kitchen sink at our small brains leaving it up the viewer to try and keep pace. Probably requiring a repeat viewing (if for no other reason that to try and understand what is being said under the cover of some very strong English accents), Layer Cake veers from the traditional cookie cutter type drug/crime caper by delivering a complex mix of violence and drama that is anything but packaged with a bow on top.By the time we are introduced to yet another group of players, headed brilliantly by the always-reliable Michael Gambon, you may need a second to collect your senses and figure out which end is up. It was like watching Memento except with more lively characters and a story that's actually worth your involvement.I was surprised to learn that this was Michael Vaughn's directorial debut. As a novice he was able to weave a complex web of multiple stories like a seasoned veteran in what I can only suspect to be a more realistic depiction of hit men and drug lords than anything Bad Boys waved in our faces a few years back.Lacking the dark humor of Lock, Stock and Snatch, Layer Cake is more like Goodfellas and to some extent Reservoir Dogs than its two closest relatives (an ass kicking scene to Duran Duran's Ordinary World was reminiscent of Dogs' Stuck in the Middle With You). It's a film composed with characters that are so unique and interesting, yet violent and criminal that you don't know who to root for. Case in point, Gene played by Star Trek veteran Colm Meany. As Jimmy Price's right hand man, Gene is a gangster that wouldn't hesitate to put a bullet in your brain if so ordered, but portrayed as a human being who is just doing what he is told to survive in a world to which he is too accustomed. He is maybe the most charismatic bad guy since Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction.Rumor in selected Trades is that Daniel Craig is the frontrunner for the Bond franchise if Pierce Brosnan decides to jump ship, and his performance in Layer Cake proves that he is up to the task. His steely blue eyes and Steve McQueen type looks can ensure that we haven't seen the last of him, and if we are lucky, in his next film his character will get a name.Layer Cake is definitely not for all types. If you have problems following CSI, then this movie is not for you. But for those of you who do stick around through the reveals and character developments, I can assure you that the payoff is worth the investment. Layer Cake will be one of those films that in a few years, men will be talking about around the work water-cooler, using words like 'ultra-cool' and maybe even 'classic'.www.gregsrants.com",Layer Cake
74,cchase,Here's Your Last Chance...,8,16 July 2006,"Matthew Vaughn learned quite a bit, it seems, while serving as a producer on Guy Ritchie's gangster romps (LOCK, STOCK...and SNATCH). But rather than simply regurgitating the best bits of those two films, LAYER CAKE is an interesting study all on its own that probably owes more to the same category that SEXY BEAST comes from, than any of the more familiar ""geezer"" pics.Now newly indentured by ""Her Majesty's Secret Service"", though it was perfectly right casting, it might be perfectly wrong for the career of Daniel Craig. From his roles in films as diverse as ""Enduring Love,"" ""The Mother"", ""Sylvia"" and even his bit in ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider,"" he's always been an interesting bloke, highly watchable and refreshingly unpredictable. LAYER CAKE may be the last chance that fans may have to see this side of him for a while, especially if CASINO ROYALE, his first outing as Bond becomes the hit that it's been predicted to be (and I have no doubt it will be.)In CAKE, Craig is in the same kind of dilemma as many actors before him, from Al Pacino and Steve McQueen to Ron O'Neal and Ray Winstone.

75,agmoldham,Haven't we seen this before,5,17 October 2004,"It seems the British film industry is in something of a rut. We churn out two types of film, the Hugh Grant rom com or the London based gangster movies. This film falls into the second category and it's hard to feel any sympathy for any of the characters here. The characters here are basically soleless which results in the viewers caring very little who bites the dust and who survives.Done very much in the lock stock style Layer Cake starts off with the feel of a pop video. It jumps around quite a bit and one or two useful acting slots are somewhat wasted on this. If anyone fancies a bit of a London gangster movie I'd recommend renting Lock Stock from the local shop. 6/10",Layer Cake

It doesn't matter that we have been here before, seen it before, heard it before, because some things that are good remain despite repetition. Cliché has been given a bad name.Indeed I have enjoyed some films more on the second sitting than I have in the first. What we have here is a professional product from professional people that treat everything as if it were an elongated 30 second television ad. Lots of clever lines (criminals in movies have more one-liners than Oscar Wilde), lots of posing and lots of film convenience.Call it cool if you want - I find it a bit dubious. Being a criminal shouldn't be portrayed as easy and the only way to make a nice living. There are too many bad messages being pushed here without an alternative voice. I don't care about ""the bad things happening"" -- bad things are happening because of mistakes, the viewer can think, ""I wouldn't be so stupid."" Let me give you the basic laundry list: Clever criminal, stupid criminal, violent criminal, sexy girl, Mr Big and what else - oh yes drugs and money (repeat twice). I haven't read the novel but if you are based on the above you cannot escape the fact that this is pulp dressed up as art. Nothing wrong with pulp, some of my favourite movies are pulp, but this wants to be smart pulp. And it isn't as smart as it thinks it is.Craig's face is strangely ugly and beautiful at the same time, but he can't really act, but here it doesn't really matter because he plays someone who doesn't want to act. He wants to turn coke in to money and then in to more coke. Although he says ""he wants out"" (should we believe him? We only have his word for it.) If it wasn't a sexy business no more interesting than someone who imports tulips from Amsterdam.Let me continue my laundry list: Guns are fired, Craig looks wide awake, danger, heavies are put in motion, cross is followed by double cross and British lovies overact their little socks off not believing that they - the limping TV actors that they really are - have finally got on the big screen.Layer Cake won't linger long in your mind, but it does zip along and keep you watching.

Daniel Craig is the sussed cocaine dealer looking to make one last deal, who suddenly finds himself forced off into tangents involving missing junkies and stolen Es. The film works in the drip-feeding of the relationships between Morty, Gene, Jimmy and all the other former members of the Crazy Larry gang. It is less effective in its employment of Dragan the Bogey Man. Quite why a bunch of gangsters would fear another hardman just because he has a bit of ethnic cleansing form is never really explained. Where the film falls down badly is in Craig's lust for the moll of one of The Duke's henchmen. That particular plot line pops up as a distraction every now and again, its function only becoming clear - and annoyingly contrived - at the very end. Good performances, fairly well plotted, and brilliant use of The Cure's 'She Sells Sanctuary' on the soundtrack.",Layer Cake

Now I eventually gave it shot because of Daniel Craig - and I had been discarding the DVD for years since knowing that producer Matthew Vaughn stepped in as director never helped me feel I was missing something.Simply put the plot is erratic with matching clumsy directing. Characters are all shallow fat stereotypes that fine actors barely help look real in the revolving doors rhythm. Daniel Craig plays a naive passive hero who constantly gets outpaced by cleverer - if elusive - characters. He happens to succeed twice to do what he wants and even then we are not at all convinced (a loser that starts to use his brains?). Neither is the director, so what is it all supposed to be? A zoo? For all the mess in Layer Cake I'd say Daniel Craig was miscast since I think he can't do comedy. Clenched teeth, steel stance: some like him cold as a dead serious 007, but clearly farcical cockney mob circus is way beyond his range. Or he simply did not meet the talented comedy director who could have opened him up.",Layer Cake

It looks as though it is going to be a slick, fast-paced organized crime caper flick along the lines of Goodfellas or Snatch. Instead, it's a garbled mess of stereotypically stupid low-life criminals whose thin storylines are all tangled together.The best analogy I can offer for this movie is that despite having the initial outward appearance of a beautiful Layer Cake, by the end it has all melded together to produce an unsightly and unpalatable caloric glob devoid of any structure or nutritive content.

I am a big fan of Trainspotting. That to me is the best film about drug use. This was not about people taking drugs, but more about people selling it.There were a few good moments in the film, but all in all I was a little bored through it. There were a couple of funny moments in it. But nothing that made me laugh out loud or anything like that.Daniel Craig looks so young and skinny in it. But he does a pretty good job in the movie. I don't have any complaints about his acting. There are some really good supporting actors in this too. Tom Hardy is in this, which I didn't know. George Harris' character is really good in it also.The thing I did like about this film is it was so English... the language they used in the movie was so raw.

The 8 out of 10 was for the difficulty of the script; I thought that there were too many bits left untied and for a simple person like me there were too many actions that I could not string together. The many changes in the script involving characters, locations and plot changes proved a little too much for the old boy. All of this certainly says more about me than the film so as a movie it will test your ability to follow the many changes in the script. If that is to myour liking then this movie is for you.As I wrote in the title this film does not emulate the silliness of Hollywood-there are no car chases, no massive mounts of blood and no stagy shootouts on city streets.

He puts in an altogether enjoyable and solid performance as the slick business like gangster planning for his retirement from his life of crime.Layer Cake is a solid film, even if it does find itself adopting many of the usual tropes of the genre and appearing a little cliche at times.Craig's character is what keeps the film interesting for me. Far too often these sorts of films rest on a central character who is unhinged and unpredictable. Craig's character breaks this mould, portraying a far more prudent and business like criminal who resents the ideas of getting his hands dirty.Without this and without Craig's performance the film would have felt more lacklustre and generic, so this was very welcome.The supporting characters felt more like the usual suspects I would expect to see in such a film. and this is where I found Layer Cake going through the motions slightly. Similarly the stylistic choices and dialogue felt somewhat familiar.The plot was a times confusing and a little convoluted, however the resolution at the end was pleasing if a little predictable.Somewhat unique of the genre, somewhat derivative, Layer Cake is enjoyable and toward the upper echelons of British Gangster films.",Layer Cake
93,Flagrant-Baronessa,Great showcase for Daniel Craig's talent - and solid entertainment,7,10 August 2006,"I can IMPOSSIBLY outline the plot of Matthew Vaughn's Layer Cake, so I'll just say it's about a nameless guy (Daniel Craig) doing some criminal stuff in London.In my observation there are three approaches to gangster characters in crime films: 1) The overly-amateurish 'gangsters' that are scared sh*t and mess up, like in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, 2) The kind of gangster who is an amateur, but picks up on criminal ways quickly and effortlessly if the occasion calls for it, like Max the cab driver from Collateral and 3) The stone-cold professionals who can do whatever, whenever with whatever, like any mob-boss, contract killer, etc.What is so endlessly refreshing about Layer Cake (2004) is that it applies none of these approaches to its main character Daniel Craig. He is a drug-dealer, but reluctantly resorts to violent ways. He hates guns. Murders and violence disturb him. He takes time to cope with things. He shows fear and hesitation. He actually bleeds when he is hit. In short, he is an extremely realistic person and this facilitates the film's realistic atmosphere - there's no glossy visuals or over-the-top violence.Now, it is my opinion that Layer Cake could have perhaps used some of the latter to spice things up. Its director is the producer of Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and it is clear here that he is trying to move away from flashy Ritchie editing and effects as much as possible, making his own film just a bit too barren in order to be 'different'. It works fine, but as a result, the gangster characters aren't very funny or colourful - rather they are down-to-earth London men trying to make a living. A shady living, true, but still a living.A few bland characters and an extra-template romantic storyline featuring Sienna Miller (I like her, but she is redundant in this film) drag this film down, but overall it is a very solid crime thriller, superbly acted by Daniel Craig. The score is great. In particular, please note the great use of ""Ordinary World"" by Duran Duran. Layer Cake isn't gloriously entertaining or anything but it feels very real and engaging and it is interesting to see the acting abilities of future Mr Bond - as well as his bare chest.7/10",Layer Cake

Then it just became more and more convoluted, throwing in twist after twist after turn that I just wanted to scream out, ""enough already""!. No one should have to work this hard to follow a film, and believe me, I strongly prefer films that have a little bit of depth and substance.Since so many are comparing this to the Guy Ritchie movies, I'd put it solidly ahead of ""Snatch,"" but solidly behind, ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.""

There is a LOT going on in a relatively short span of time. Numerous motives and events collide into each other at a break neck pace and if you blink, you might find yourself wondering what the hell just happened or at least wondering why it happened or how. I came into the movie expecting this since I had seen lock stock and two smoking barrels and snatch and expected a lot of side plots to smash into each other with reckless abandon. This movie delivers the goods with lots of creepy characters and totally insane situations. It really captures the feel of what it's like to hang around in the circles of the underworld trying to make a buck. It's that desperation to do anything to make the money but at the same time, an equal if not stronger desperation to get the hell out of the business with the next job. Unfortunately, the next job always leads into the next job, not anywhere out- that's the nature of the business. This movie is complex, fun to watch and gritty all at the same time. Even if you are used to the retarded linear plots that Hollywood barfs up and calls a script you will still like this movie, even though you will probably miss half of what is going on. I caught everything but I wound up explaining a lot of the movie to the person sitting next to me because they didn't know the brit slang and they weren't particularly swift upstairs. If you are familiar with the genre, you will get what you came looking for. A slick highly detailed movie about gangsters in a progressively more desperate situation with lots of plot twists and turns.

But ultimately what you end up with is a James Bond cross Snatch movie, which I gave the benefit of the doubt of being good. On the opposite end of the spectrum is that it does feel predictable, forced, clichéd and copied from other films of a similar type. Though Layer Cake wasn't as good as I was led to believe, it did benefit from a good cast. The characters were generally likable and genuinely fun to watch.

102,paudie,Brilliant British thriller,9,8 April 2010,"A friend gave this to me with a very high recommendation and I certainly wasn't disappointed. This is one of the best thrillers I've seen in some time.Daniel Craig plays an ""ordinary decent"" drug dealer in London. He has tried to be as businesslike as possible and is planning to retire soon with the fruits of his hard work.However one of his more prominent criminal contacts asks him, as a last favour, to help find the daughter of an even more high-ranking drug lord (Michael Gambon). At the same time Serbian criminals come to London looking for Craig after being ripped off by some of his associates.The plot takes so many twists and turns and so many characters move through the film that it is pointless to go through them here. Suffice it to say you never quite know who has the upper hand and who is telling the truth. I admit I was glad to be watching it on DVD as I found it helpful a couple of times to rewind and confirm what had just happened time. The running time is less than two hours but it feels a lot longer as so much happens.First time director Matthew Vaughn has done a fine job. He was producer on ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch"", both directed by Guy Ritchie. There are some similarities with these films such as the criminal underworld setting and the London locations but this film is much more serious and lacks the tongue in cheek air of those two films.The film is based on the novel by JJ Connolly. The acting is excellent from the stars and the many character actors such as Colm Meany.Like the friend who gave me the DVD I would highly recommend this film.",Layer Cake

You sort of have no one to root for cause you don't want to see the crooks do better than you who follows the rules, but you also are human and have some sympathy so you don't want to see them all killed. That essential problem limits the genre's potential. I thought that some of the filming was really great and creative, but some scenes they took it too far with the shaky camera and moving around, making it too hard to watch. And this film is set in England so has some good scenery of that country. The real reason I watched it was cause I wanted to see a pre-Bond Daniel Craig film and he was good here. I can see why they picked him for the next Bond. I also saw that it was a Sony Pictures Classic film and I have liked several of those in the past and am interested in seeing more of them.

Then there's George Harris as X's partner in crime, Morty, the always excellent Colm Meaney as X's mentor, Gene, Jamie Forman as the impulsive Duke and Sally Hawkins as his psycho girlfriend, a young Tom Hardy as X's cooker, Clarke, and in a tour de force performance, Michael Gambon as the deliciously corrupt Eddie Temple. Credit also has to go to JJ Connolly for being able to adapt his novel to the big screen as well as first time director Matthew Vaughn for creating a sharp, focused and fast moving film that never bores its audience (along with some rather creative shots like the scene where X makes his first kill). It all comes together to create a story so real that, although it may take place in Britain, one feels it could happen anywhere and undoubtedly does in one form or another. So, enter the ""Layercake"", if you dare! Cheerio!!",Layer Cake

109,oshram-3,A little too clever for its own good,6,22 December 2005,"Sooner or later (and I expected sooner to be before now, frankly), someone would follow up on Guy Ritchie's brilliant work in Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels and especially Snatch. It's an overstatement to say that if you've seen those, you've seen this film, but they are cut from similar cloth.Layer Cake follows an unnamed cocaine dealer (Daniel Craig) as, on the verge of retirement, he is drawn into a crushing web of deceit, betrayal, and murder. It seems a rogue dealer known as The Duke (Jamie Foreman) has ripped off a cartel from Amsterdam, and our unnamed character has been fingered by his boss, Jimmy (Kenneth Cranham) to set things straight. There's also a subplot about a kidnapped girl that goes nowhere, and a hell of a lot of backstory about several characters thrown in for good measure.Layer Cake is competent enough, but you have seen this huge-cast/who's-screwing-over-whom thing before. There are the requisite characters: the loudmouth idiot, the cool-as-ice killer, the colorful right hand man, etc. While the movie prides itself on being clever, it's only mildly so, but I give points for some style. The plot gets a little too convoluted and the flashy camera-work and by now requisite out-of-sequence storytelling don't particularly help, either.Where Layer Cake does work is in the performances. Craig has a nice presence that helps glue the film together (you can start to see why they chose him as the new James Bond after watching this) and he's very easy to like. Having the ever-terrific Colm Meany along for the ride doesn't hurt, either, and he provides the film with what little humor it has (a huge difference between this and Ritchie's work is that this film takes itself a little (too) seriously, a feeling you never get with Ritchie). Everyone else  including Michael Gambon, better known as Harry Potter's mentor Dumbledore  is perfectly cast, and the performances are all spot on, from spastic amateurs to ruthless old pros. The casting excels here, and that can cover a lot of sins.Layer Cake is an enjoyable enough film, but in its desire to be archly clever it goes too far; much like the old Kevin Costner clunker No Way Out, those behind this film couldn't resist tossing in one last twist  which, it turns out, was at least one too many. Clever is a wonderful thing to be; but you can get so caught up in being clever that you stop being good, and one should never lose sight of that particular forest for the trees.",Layer Cake
110,Jamie_Seaton,A brilliant British gangster film with style,10,12 August 2009,"this is a top notch gangster flick that seems to get better and better with each viewing. it really should be on longer though, it really pulls you in and when it finishes it leaves you wanting more. the film is very stylish and well directed by Matthew Vaughn who i haven't heard of before.the cast in this film is superb. there's a lot of good British actors in it like Daniel Craig, Michael Gambon, Ben Whishaw, Sienna Miller, Jamie Foreman and new upcoming superstar in my eyes ""Tom Hardy""..... Tom Hardy is an awesome actor that will be the biggest British star soon. he is in other titles such as Bronson, Rock n Rolla, The Take and Cape Wrath. Daniel Craig is brilliant in this as a cocaine dealer that has more than he bargained for as the film goes further into the story.the story on a whole is nice and complex and keeps you excited until the very end. a very good British gangster film that gets better with every watch......... 9/10........j.d Seaton",Layer Cake
111,extravaluejotter,The Dessert that Satisfies,7,19 March 2007,"Matthew Vaughn has learned a lot from Guy Ritchie. The producer of ""Lock Stock"", ""Snatch"" and ""Swept Away"" made his directorial debut with ""Layer Cake"" and provided his audience with everything that they expect from a modern British crime thriller. Vaughn is clearly a man who loves London, and he has worked closely with cinematographer Ben Davis to show the city's glamorous side, as well as its dark underworld.There is a lot of surface glitz in ""Layer Cake"" and the story is hardly an original one, but it is well written (adapted from his own novel by J J Connolly) and well acted by a fine cast that includes some of the UK's best character actors. What sets it above the slew of post-""Lock Stock"" Brit gangster flicks of recent years is its conviction. The story is played straight and any moments of humour arise naturally from the interplay between the characters. The cinematography is blessedly free of pop video tics, but Ben Davis is not afraid to view things from odd angles. The scene where a beating is viewed from the victim's perspective is particularly well shot.This is the most important lesson that Matthew Vaughn has learned from Guy Ritchie. Shooting a film like it's a pop video and filling it with comedy stereotypes only works once. Vaughn deserves credit for taking a stale Brit-flick genre and giving it a much-needed injection of style, instead of trying to copy ""Lock Stock"" like so many before him (including Guy Ritchie's ""Lock Stock"" re-tread, ""Snatch""). ""Layer Cake"" is up there with ""Get Carter"" and ""The Long Good Friday"". It doesn't get much better than that, son.",Layer Cake

113,dtb,Chameleon Craig Does a Steve McQueen in Brutal But Sleek Thriller,9,16 July 2005,"After an art house release everywhere else in the civilized world, LAYER CAKE (LC) unexpectedly premiered in our area, the Lehigh Valley, at the $4 theater in Easton (this joint started as a second-run theater, but it's been getting some acclaimed imports and indies lately, too. Somebody there is a good programmer!). This British import, adapted by J.J. Connolly from his novel, is a taut crime drama that moves with the sleek menace of a tiger. Imagine THE BIG SLEEP with an ever-so-slightly more coherent plot and, as its protagonist, a prosperous, wily drug dealer looking to retire after one last score instead of tough but noble private eye Philip Marlowe. Our hero's problem is that he's a careful, calculating businessman in a dicey business where he's surrounded by loose cannons who shoot, stab, or punch first and ask questions later. Director Matthew Vaughn has been best known as Guy Ritchie's producer, but in his directorial debut Vaughn is like Martin Scorsese to Ritchie's Barry Sonnenfeld (that's meant as a compliment to all concerned, I assure you). It helps that Vaughn gets excellent performances from Daniel Craig as our cool but in-over-his-head unnamed antihero (usually films and books that refuse to name their main character strike me as trying too hard to be clever, but it works here), Michael Gambon nearly stealing the show as a cultured but ruthless narcotics kingpin, Colm Meaney and THE INTERPRETER's George Harris as our protagonist's partners in crime, and many folks from Guy Ritchie's films. Sienna Miller doesn't get to do much beyond being eye candy, but she's tasty eye candy indeed. I'm as heterosexual a gal as they come, but after seeing lithe, leggy Miller strip down to black lingerie and garters, I couldn't help thinking, ""That Jude Law is one lucky guy!"" :-) One of the things I liked about LC is that the protagonist, while thoughtful and competent, is never quite as clever as he thinks he is; somehow everybody manages to be one step ahead of him, if only because they're all so damned unpredictable. Though I've only seen Daniel Craig in three of his many films (the other two were THE ROAD TO PERDITION and THE JACKET), he's clearly one of those actors who never looks or sounds the same from role to role, so if he does indeed end up being Pierce Brosnan's successor as James Bond as rumored, it'll be interesting to see how he fares playing the same character in more than one film! :-) In any case, Craig certainly lives up to the ""new Steve McQueen"" rep that LC has garnered him. I look forward to seeing what he'll do next!",Layer Cake
114,scobbah,Decent piece,9,18 June 2005,"Before I went to the cinema to see this film, I was told by friends who had seen it that this one delivers more violence then the previous pieces by the director Matthew Vaughn. I really enjoyed this as I was gladly surprised. This one is a bit different in my humble opinion compared to Vaughn's previous works, and it contains even more small funny intelligent details then usual, but I'm afraid I missed some of those wonderful fast dialogs we're used to from Lock Stock and Snatch to mention a few. Anyhow it is well worth the time and this one does best at the cinema! Daniel Craig plays his role with a neat touch and I really enjoy his character. Go see this one today!",Layer Cake

The perfect vehicle for the current 007 Daniel Craig as we are drawn into a perhaps unlikely tale of Craig's character XXXX locating the missing daughter of his boss' friend. Standing in the way are millions of pounds worth of Ecstasy and a violent Serbian gang....This ain't going to be as simple as XXXX likes to think....Craig and Michael Gambon are the purveyors of strong acting, while Sienna Miller adds a touch of glamour to a seemingly seedy and gloomy underground world, where nothing is what it seems....Follow a plot full of intriguing twists and smart, strong performances, and the story arrives at an extremely powerful and (at the same time) ominous conclusion.

116,tmpsvita,A good first project from Matthew Vaughn,7,20 January 2018,"First project for Matthew Vaughn (""Stardust"", ""Kick-Ass"", ""Kingman"") as director, he had previously played only roles as producer, and this is the first proof of his great talent as such.
""Layer Cake"" has all the features that have made Vaughn a very influential personality in the world of entertainment cinema, especially in recent years; also here the director is often dynamic, very fluid, fast, almost frenetic, extremely original and imaginative, especially in the appropriate but never predictable use of certain tools to create sequences with a strong visual and emotional impact thanks to beautiful camera movements and long shots.
A script certainly interesting and engaging, as well as well designed but that in its being quick to keep up with the (masterful) editing and directing, lose a few pieces. Given also the considerable amount of details and information that are added with the advancing of time and that make the story more and more complex, more ""calm"" moments would have been pleasing to be able to rework the whole and be able to better understand the plot that in some points get confused.
This is why the film although technically is incredible and the interpretations are quite satisfying, in the end it gave me the feeling of being a half-exploited opportunity that, yes, in general is more than sufficient, but that if better managed from the narrative point of view could really have left a more significant sign in the ""modern"" cinema, it could have turned into a small pearl destined to become a cult.",Layer Cake
117,Ben-Hibburd,Layer Cake Review.,9,17 September 2017,"Layer Cake is the directorial debut from British director Matthew Vaughn. The film stars Daniel Craig as XXXX, a man with no name. XXXX is, as he eloquently states ""I'm no gangster, i'm just a businessman whose commodity happens to be cocaine"". The main plot of the film sees XXXX tasked with two objectives his supplier Jimmy Price(Kenneth Cranham), before he can retire from the business.Firstly he's tasked with finding the daughter of a powerful businessman, Eddie Temple(Michael Gambon), whose a friend of Jimmy's. Secondly he has to negotiate with an unhinged dealer named Duke (Jamie Foreman). Duke and his gang have stolen 1,000,000 ecstasy tablets, from a gang of Serbian war criminals. The gang unleash an assassin only known as Dragon to track down and retrieve the stolen merchandise and exact retribution on anyone involved.Layer Cake is an extremely well crafted gangster thriller. The film has a-lot of plot threads intersecting throughout, which is both a benefit and a hindrance. It can take a couple of viewings to piece together everything that happens. However when it is put together the film makes sense and there aren't any glaring plot inconsistencies, which makes for a rewarding experience.Daniel Craig gives a fantastic performance as XXXX, in a role many credit for him receiving the role of James Bond. The film also has a brilliant supporting cast, filled with plenty of recognisable veteran British actors peppered through-out. Michael Gambon, Colm Meany, Tamer Hassan and George Harris all turn in solid performances. Featured alongside them are the newer faces of Tom Hardy and Sienna Miller.After a spate of rubbish British gangster films in the early 00's, Layer Cake hits the mark. The films screenplay is treated with maturity unlike a-lot of other films in the genre. The characters are also developed beyond having a cool nick-name like Bullet-Tooth Tony. The film is also well paced, rarely getting bogged down in too much plot exposition. Except for one flashback scene, which stands out like a sore thumb, with too much exposition being thrown at the viewer.Matthew Vaughn's debut feels more subdued stylistically then his more recent films. His direction is more minimalist and not as flashy as other directors in the genre. The film focuses on characters first and foremost. Instead he uses his style to add depth to a scene, on in- particular being a scene in a diner that is spectacularly violent, but shot from the victims pov.The only downside i have with this film is that, even as a Brit some of the dialogue is hard to understand. Especially actors with thick Northern accents. Whilst the film congeals together in the end, there are A-LOT of characters in the film. I found it near impossible to know who was who and what there motivations were. The film definitely plays far better upon a re-watch, but that shouldn't be the case.Layer Cake is the best British gangster film since The Long Good Friday. it's a film that stands amongst the giants of the genre. The film is a tense thriller, with multiple twists and turns. It's a film that has substance to got with the style.",Layer Cake

119,mdewey,Layered out criminal saga,9,1 March 2009,"Not your ""James Bond"" Daniel Craig role in this movie, which consists of a down and dirty melange of assorted thuggies and druggies in a complex tale of double and triple dealings in the ""layered"" London/Western Europe drug empire. Craig's role as ""XXXX"" starts out as an interloper/middle man for the London big-wig drug kingpins, which is a left-handed way of saying he keeps his hands clean of the normal day-to-day street operations and makes big cash as a squeaky-clean go-between for the money men. But the so called Mr. Big, Jimmie Price (Kenneth Cranham), has some additional work for our pristine college boy that most assuredly leads him into unsavory territories where he must get his hands dirty (and bloody). His normal crew of Clarkie, Mortie and Terry are now to include the likes of Gene, Duke, Slasher, Sydney etc., who comprise some the street riff-raff he has to associate with to carry out the boss' directives. Add to that, another big boss emerges who may, in fact, be the ""real"" Main Man. The local constabulary along with the Liverpool boys also have some pivotal involvement in this nefarious mix.What ensues is a complicated but engrossing tale of criminal crosses and double-crosses as the Serbs, the Liverpool boys and others in the London mob and law enforcement intersect one another's paths in this melodramatic tour-de-force. The layers of our metaphorical cake are eventually stripped aside and lead to a most dramatic conclusion. I don't think I'll see another film of this mettle for quite some time. The contributions by all involved in this project were realistic, poignant and entertaining. My only knocks on the film are the ""overkill"" scenes of gratuitous violence.

But it was truly Daniel Craig and Dumbledore himself who stole the show. All the cast was awesome but these two, with the few scenes they had together, truly shined.

One of the difficulties (at least in the cinema in which I saw the movie) was the dialogue if often hard to catch, making the plot even more obscure. Whatever happened to Mid Atlantic Dialogue ? In the quest for realism in colloquial speech we now often have difficulty in following what is being said. Especially when the tendency for some actors is to mumble their lines anyway. In USA, TV shows like ""Charmed"" have the girls sounding like chipmunks, while in the UK some of the dialects need subtitles.

However, big boss Jimmy Price hands down a tough assignment: find Charlotte Ryder, the missing rich princess daughter of Jimmy's old pal Edward, a powerful construction business player & gossip papers socialite. Complicating matters are two million pounds' worth of Grade A ecstasy, a brutal neo-Nazi sect & a whole series of double crossings. What is revealed is a modern underworld where the rules have changed. There are no 'codes', or 'families' & respect lasts as long as a line. Not knowing who he can trust, he has to use all his 'savvy', 'telling' & skills which make him one of the best, to escape his own.

The Directors previous 2 films with Guy Ritchie have become of cult classics (kind of ""Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels"" & ""Snatch""). Layer Cake is like Goodfellas & to some extent Reservoir Dogs. Daniel Craig gives a good solid performance. His acting does help place him well in the movie. The rest of the performances are pretty good. Layer Cake shares a similar violence-flecked, soundtrack-driven m.o to the other 2 movies. Here Vaughn's well constructed film-with its sleek sets & tales of a drug dealer contemplating retirement- is better entertainment than the other 2 films. Nice plot & views in the depiction of how the worlds of the rich, the criminal & the criminally rich intersect Good Production design and quite good cinematography. From the title ""Layer Cake"" we see a vertical stacking construction: it stacks layers upon layers, much as ""The Usual Suspects"". There are several flashback/sub plots which don't particularly help as they can confuse you if you're not paying attention. There were many characters introduced to you in a short space of time and then suddenly going off at a tangent involving some of the 'slightly minor lead' characters. The film is very much Daniel Craig's movie –he went on to star in the last 2 James Bond films. You might get lost in this story (my main negative comment) with so many twists and turns.

Throughout so much of this movie I just couldn't help but feel like I've seen all this before, in just about every other drug/crime/gangster movie from the early 2000s.While some parts were simple clichés, others were simply off-putting additions to an already familiar plot. Now, the story evolves into something else, and it's actually pretty decent. But the premise itself: one last job, essential, was almost enough to make me not watch the film in the first place.I'll say two more things about this movie. The first is that I can see why Daniel Craig was cast as James Bond after this performance. You can just see 007 in the way he carries himself, and I enjoyed watching it. The second is that cockney accents, or whatever these characters had, can absolutely be funny, but they're sure as heck not sexy.",Layer Cake

However the film is messing around too much with different narrative strands so as to seem devoid of a coherent whole of any sort. Its trying to be puzzling for the sake of it when really all this movie brings across is that gangsters, drug dealers criminals, whatever, always screw each other over in the end, and that you can't really trust anyone.I'm frankly a bit sick and tired with all the entrepreneurs still trying to make a buck off the legacy of 'Lock Stock...' and even if the producers,director, backers do not admit it that is what they are trying to do here.If Vaughn really wants to become accomplished as a director then maybe he could try to make a successful British film that does'nt involve guns, drugs etc etc. Perhaps focus on a unique mix of genres, styles and narratives to put British films back on the map as this is not going to do it.I'm not saying this film is bad its just not very good, with a few interesting moments but overall is helped along by the excellent Daniel Craig and Micheal Gambon, who puts in a typical performance. All in all I think that the whole British gangster thing, even though it is done fairly well here, seems very passe.On the plus side I thought the cinematography was brilliant and the technical attributes great, I'm just a bit sick and tired of the genre.

I was totally surprised with this movie. It was awesome!It tells the story of an unnamed person, XXXX (Daniel Craig), a drug- dealer who wants to retire from his job, but he receives two final assignments from his boss that will make his and his partners life very difficult.The story is well introduced to us, as well as the main character, and from the first minutes I got hooked into the story and I couldn't stop watching it. One of the main reasons to watch this movie is Daniel Craig. He is awesome in his role of the cocaine dealer, and I'm sure that from this role, he got the one of the following Bond movies, but his character in here is nothing similar like Bond. Also the other actors were great in their roles, even if it were small. From Michael Gambon, George Harris, Colm Meaney or Tom Hardy to actors like Ben Wishaw or Sienna Miller they all played a good part in their roles and added a lot to the story. I specially liked Michael Gambon in the role of Eddie Temple and George Harris in the role of Morty.One of the best things of this movie is all the editing, camera work and cinematography. Matthew Vaughn did an awesome job in here capturing all the places they visit in London and also capturing the feeling of the dark places of the city. All of this is mixed with some truly amazing scenes, like the one with Morty hitting one character in a bar, which is show from the perspective of the victim, another one where XXXX infiltrates in the house of one of the characters during the night, the great opening of the movie or the amazing (and surprising) ending of the movie.

131,carlo_simone18,A Lesser British Crime Thriller,6,23 January 2018,"I was certainly expecting more from this film and I was slightly disappointed to be honest. The story seemed interesting at the beginning, but as it branches out into multiple threads it loses focus and becomes more convoluted. Snatch is a much better example of managing multiple story threads without it becoming too confusing.However, the acting is excellent, particularly from Daniel Craig, Colm Meaney and George Harris. Michael Gambon also does a good job in the short amount of screen time he has. The direction is also superb, with their being some innovative shots and cinematography.The romance between XXXX and Tammy seemed to be a bit forced into the narrative for me, but it does lead to a quite poignant ending when XXXX is shot by Tammy's boyfriend Sidney, as it hammers home the message that there was no way he would be able to leave the drugs business, and that all his efforts were for nothing.Overall this is a fairly average British crime film, but not quite to the standard of previous examples.",Layer Cake
132,eht5y,"Sharp, if a bit Haphazard",8,27 August 2005,"'Layer Cake' follows in the tradition of sharp English drugs/gangster flicks like 'Trainspotting' and 'Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.' Initially, one might ask what remains to be added to this genre, but 'Layer Cake' proves itself worthy if not entirely original by presenting a more mature, less frenetic, and occasionally surprising take on the lives of dealers trying to make the big score.Daniel Craig's 'X' is a refreshing change from the typical gangster--more an urban sophisticate than a swaggering player, he prefers a low profile, and observes (in voice-over dialog well written enough to compensate for the overuse of the device in this sort of picture) that drugs are just good business, and if one can stay removed from the trappings of the culture, a great way to retire before 40. Of course, there would be no film if the hero were to avoid the inevitable complications, which arrive with such swiftness that you can almost see X's head spinning. He's implicated in the theft of a large supply of ecstasy; his boss forces him to search for the wayward daughter of a fellow mobster; he learns that he is being pursued by a Serbian hit-man who specializes in presenting his victims' heads to his clients; he finds himself falling for an unstable thug's girlfriend--all on the eve of his long-planned retirement from the business.Things go wrong for X so fast and in so many ways that it's often hard to follow the film's direction, and, as is the case with 'Trainspotting' and 'Lock, Stock,' the rapid-fire cockney gangster dialog can be hard to follow for untrained American ears. But the film is redeemed by Craig's superb performance as a man who has perfected the art of control only to see all of his walls and pretenses leveled in the course of just a few days. Particularly affecting is the scene in which X copes with the after-effects of having committed murder for the first time--haunting, powerful stuff, and certainly unusual in a genre where the characters generally kill indiscriminately and without conscience.In a sense, too much happens too fast--some of the plot lines seem extraneous, especially X's affair with the girlfriend (Sienna Miller), which might be viewed as an excuse to give the character the necessary love interest and show us a sexy girl in lingerie. But, altogether, the many diverging plots converge, and we are left with a coherent narrative spun out of a cascade of disorder and surprise. It's not perfect, but 'Layer Cake' is a worthy addition to the gangster thriller genre, giving us enough of what we expect along with a few surprises to keep it from seeming derivative.",Layer Cake
133,DesbUK,A Potential Sleeper Hit.,8,10 March 2005,"'Layer Cake' opens in the US in May and I think it could be a big sleeper hit (like '28 Days Later' and 'The Full Monty'). The movie is very heavily plotted - but always intelligent and never stupid. Much of the time it reminded me of 'The Long Good Friday'- the same idea of the gangster at the height of his powers watching his world crumble over the space of a few days, only in this movie its Serbian gangsters rather than the IRA. Also, after the anonymous hero has executed Kenneth Cranham, there's a scene of him cleansing himself in the shower which is exactly the same as Bob Hoskins showering himself after killing one of his own men in 'The Long Good Friday'. And the ending is directly out of 'Carlito's Way.But none of this really matters as the film is so compelling and well-directed by Matthew Vaughan. Best of all is Daniel Craig - this movie announces his arrival as a major screen presence. He actually makes you care about a character who is morally dubious.",Layer Cake
134,nowonmai42,Insert cake pun here,6,27 August 2005,"It's impressive that ""Layer Cake,"" another British crime film with all the genre's hallmarks, manages to keep things interesting. There's little here that hasn't been seen before: the hero who gets pulled in deeper the more he tries to get out, the missing valuables that everyone wants, the hothead gangster who complicates things, and the old man who exudes menace through his calm demeanor. ""Layer Cake"" falls somewhere between ""Sexy Beast"" and the capers of Guy Ritchie. Less cerebral than the former, less manic and slap-happy than the latter, it settles on a sort of flat detachment that keeps the frills to a minimum. And like its nameless protagonist, it's at times smarter than it appears, while at others not as much as it thinks.""Layer Cake""'s criminal world is typically complex and convoluted, but trickier to follow than many similar films owing to a lack of colorful character monikers like the Butcher, the Blade, or Bullet-Tooth. What kind of underworld is this, populated by Jimmys and Eddies and Larrys? Such simplicity is reflected in the work philosophy of our protagonist, a drug ring middleman. Keep your operations to a manageable size, limit your professional contacts, don't get greedy, and retire rich and happy. Easy enough in theory, but inevitably complicated when your supplier charges you with tracking down the runaway daughter of an old friend. Even dicier when the shipment of ecstasy he tells you to move turns out to have been stolen from a gang of murderous Serbian ex-militaries. And that's just the set up.Of course things are not what they seem. Some or all of these elements are macguffins, which direct many of the film's characters away from the coming double, triple, and quadruple crosses as efficiently as they do the audience. Each layer of treachery our hero uncovers comes with it another person with a reason to kill him. As he reminds us in voice-over, though, being a middleman is about bringing people together; drop out at the right moment and they'll just crash directly into one another.""Layer Cake"" doesn't strictly cheat to unravel its plot machinations, but does rely on some unlikely help from some characters to resolve itself. It's largely gratifying, though, to follow mostly smart characters doing their best to outwit each other, as in Quentin Tarantino's ""Jackie Brown."" The film indeed owes a tip of the cap to the crime goulash made famous by Elmore Leonard. The hoods of ""Layer Cake"" have no permanent alliances nor loyalties. Everyone gets along fine as long as they all play by the rules, which in a film like this is as likely as a cameo by Pauly Shore. The end, shamelessly pinched from Brian de Palma, feels a bit abrupt and tacked-on, but nonetheless fits the film's overarching logic. Uncovered bases can expose sharp points that stick just when you think you're clear. Sometimes it's not enough to be the smartest guy in the room.",Layer Cake
135,OllieZ,"Flawed, yet interesting take on British Gangster genre.",9,26 May 2005,"Matt Vaughn's Layer Cake shares more comparison with a Michael Mann film than Ritchies upbeat gangster films. However, whilst Ritchie's films 'hit the spot' as it were, Vaughn's Layer Cake lacks the energy and fluidity to reach the heights Ritchie scaled.Craig is fantastic is XXXX, mixing humour and seriousness to create a fantastic character, one who is (naturally) ambiguous. Surely this film is the turning point of this man's career - after supporting parts in Road to Perdition and wallowing in mediocrity with Tomb Raider, Craig has found a film that really shows off his range.Colm Meaney is great as Gene, Gambon too, in his somewhat minor role. Although most of the actors in the film are great, the problem is that there are too many characters, some which are introduced badly, without any explanation. This might not be Vaughn's fault, but surely someone could have made the story a little more easy to follow? The plot itself is simple, with more double crossings than a Coen Brothers film. Yet the film never really takes off - the story is stuck in first gear, only in certain sections does it reach the heights of Lock Stock or Snatch.Visually the film is great, showing off the landmarks of London in all their gritty glory - and exposing a new side to London that might not have seen before on film. The soundtrack accompanies the film well, the scene where we meet Sienna Miller's character in the nightclub has the tune ""You got the love"" by Candi Station - fantastic. This reminded me of those great entrances Scorsese used to do in his films - like when we see Johnny Boy in Mean Streets, walking in slow motion to Jumping Jack Flash by The Rolling Stones.Vaughn has made a great debut for himself. The acting is well done, the visuals and music is just right - it is the story that lets the film down, sometimes trying to do too much. I am certain Vaughn will do well on his next film (X3).",Layer Cake

So, how the director of those titles and producer for Guy Ritchie manages to make this hollow, empty, pointless movie.It lacks everything that those movies are famous for. It's not smart, nor funny, neither emotional, worst of all it isn't even violent. I hear comparisons with Carlito's Way, but that is simply ridiculous, I won't go in details why. However after all this said and all the disappointment, still it's not that bad. It has unusual storytelling, subsequently it's unpredictable, that keeps you from falling to boredom.

138,ashi-lance,Layer Cake '04,8,7 February 2013,"Matthew Vaughn (Director of Stardust & Kick-Ass) made an impressive Directorial debut with Daniel Craig in the lead for the first time in his career in Layer Cake, a British movie.Craig, portrays a successful cocaine dealer at the top of his game, and he's planning to get out while he is ahead. His boss has one last assignment though, to find the missing daughter of his old pal. Caught up in a major ecstasy deal, a brutal Serbian gang and everyone trying to double cross each other, Craig has go against his own rules and outwit the lot of them. The movie packs on the machismo and revels in the outlaw's contempt for the ""straight"" world without ever losing track of the menace and danger of the outlaw way of life. The plot is full of twists and turns and may take more than one viewing to take in, which is good for movie fans who like their films ""chewy"". Layer Cake runs a fairly brisk hour and forty some odd minutes. It's well paced and has great narration. The lead character played by Daniel Craig (aka the next/future James Bond) is interesting as sort of someone obviously greedy but smart enough to know he's in the wrong business. There's an excellent mixture of fear in his character's actions/dialogue which is well placed earning believability.The supporting cast, on the whole English produce polished snappy dialogue with cool, collected energy. The editing is fast paced, but thankfully the director has chosen a fairly linear storyline. Layer Cake is based on a novel by J.J. Connolly, who wrote the screenplay for the movie. Originally Guy Ritchie was due direct but he had to put out because of scheduling conflicts. This was a blessing really because we all know that Ritchie would have just made Layer Cake a comical mockery fair. What Vaughan did was he played the material as straight as possible, keeping comedy to a minimum and a made an good example of a British Gangster film. Vaughan shows that he could handle the material and do some stylist directing trick like a pro, fitting in with the film.My Rating 8/10",Layer Cake

141,roger-pettit1,An entertaining British crime thriller,8,16 June 2012,"""Layer Cake"" may not be a particularly original film. Its plot seems reminiscent of countless others, e.g. ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"". Nonetheless, it is a stylish and entertaining one and keeps the viewer hooked right up until the final scene. Daniel Craig plays a drug dealer (whose character is not actually named and who is referred to simply as ""XXXX"" in the closing credits) in London. He regards himself as a businessman rather than a criminal. He professes to a hatred of guns and violence and he goes about his lucrative dealings in a low-key manner and in a way designed to keep himself under the radar and out of trouble. His aim is to make some money and to retire to Spain or somewhere similar to enjoy the fruits of his ill-gotten gains. However, his plans come awry when, on the threshold of retirement, he is asked by a powerful crime boss with whom he has done a number of deals in the past (Jimmy Price, played by Kenneth Cranham) to find the missing daughter of a friend and associate of his. That friend and associate turns out to be Eddie Temple (brilliantly portrayed by Michael Gambon), who is even more powerful, devious and ruthless than Price. It transpires that Price's motives in asking for his friend's daughter to be located are not as altruistic as they seem. Price also asks Craig's character to find a buyer for a huge consignment of drugs that have, in fact, been stolen by another dealer (The Duke, played by Jamie Foreman) from a ruthless Serbian drugs gang whose leader Dragan has a penchant for beheading anyone who gets in his way. Craig's character finds it difficult to say no to the powerful Price and so he embarks on a course that raises his profile and makes him enemies. ""Layer Cake"" is a riveting film. Although its plot earns few marks for originality, it is a well- written one (by J J Connolly, who based the screenplay on his own novel of the same name) and is clearly and accessibly portrayed. There are several clever twists that are plausible and unexpected. I have seen so many films of this sort in which the plot is either ludicrous or does not hang together properly. That is most definitely not the case here. The direction is very good and Craig himself is excellent in the starring role. The supporting cast, which contains a number of well-known British character actors as well as stars such as Gambon, are all very good too. The soundtrack, which features British rock music by the likes of The Cult and Duran Duran and which makes good use at the end of the film of Joe Cocker's version of ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood"", perfectly complements what we see on the screen. There are some minor visual continuity errors. One such is that the injuries on the face of Craig's character after he receives a going over from his fellow gangsters for supposed disloyalty are not compatible with each other in succeeding scenes. I also think that the film's attempts at humour are somewhat misplaced. Here are two examples. Temple is portrayed as liking opera and in one scene is keen to complete a conversation so that he can get away to go to a performance of Berlioz's ""The Damnation of Faust"". A northern hit man, when travelling in a taxi with Craig's character, is more keen on practising his oral French in readiness for an imminent test than on a more normal conversation. These two scenes are presumably intended to lighten things up. But they seem merely to be bolted on for the sake of it and add nothing to the development of either character. These are minor weaknesses though. ""Layer Cake"" is an entertaining film that is well worth seeing. 8/10.",Layer Cake
142,benkitching13,"A stylish, occasionally tedious thriller with a commendable lead performance.",8,28 June 2018,"7.5 out of 10 for clarification. Layer Cake is most appropriately summarised as a stylish, though occasionally tedious thriller with a commendable lead performance. The style of the film is evident throughout in it's score (which is utilised to great extent in some scenes), in addition to the superb editing and cinematography. Daniel Craig is highly accomplished in the lead role as the intelligent, professional and anonymous drug dealer, who delivers a considered monologue throughout. Craig is bolstered by a generally impressive though somewhat derivative supporting cast. Additionally, the film benefits from spouts of humour and multiple plot twists. However, at times, Layer Cake succumbs to tedious drama.",Layer Cake

The DVD title is L4yer Cake for a reason that totally escapes logic unless it's an aside about the four (count 'em) plots cobbled together for this mish-mash of violent rubbish.While it is worth a look, it fails to come close to the directors former works mainly because the thing is overwritten by half. There are too many similar characters, too many sub-plots and the whole storyline is so convoluted that it's extraordinarily difficult to follow at times.Having said that, Daniel Craig shows enough of the stuff that won him the Bond role. However, he too is held back by a poor script and some silly pretension. Early on he says he hates guns, for example, only to expertly assassinate someone with a stolen one just moments later. That's a minor one but you get the idea. Sure, he 'agonises' over It later but it's simply not believable in the first place and so all the backpedaling in the world doesn't set it to rights.The old, evil warlords (far too many of the similar type for mine) are quite fun in a stereotypical, flat fashion and the love affair (if that's what it is) between Craig and the blond bombshell is so badly handled (I'm assuming the director and screenwriter think it's cool and clever but they'd been playing with each other if they did) that it is simple also unbelievable.In short, this is an interesting diversion but don't expect to be blown away by of it - especially the plot.

Daniel Craig is especially good in the lead role, while Michael Gambon showing just how good an actor he is. MY favourite performance in the film is from Colm Meaney who comes across and funny but with a nasty hint of menace. Matthew Vaughn has made a great directing debut, surround himself with some great talent. The cinematography is wonderful. If it wasn't for the drugs, violence and murder it would be a great advert for how stylish London is.

The story is about a cocaine dealer who has been given two difficult tasks to complete before his retirement. Even though this story's been told/seen many times, it's not easy to predict what's going to happen so it keeps the suspense without any major -noticable- setbacks or very slow scenes.It's a nice watch.

I was not sure what to expect i'd heard numerous opinions on the film mostly good but had never got round to watching it for myself. For starters i'm not a HUGE fan of British films as to be honest they bore me , there depressing and are usually let's be honest bland! However i am not saying that goes for all British movies of course not! some of my favourite movies and some of the greatest movies ever made are just that. However over time i've grown to like Craig as an actor and after finding a new level of respect for his handling of the ""james bond"" character. I felt it was time to watch this.Firstly this film is very entertaining it really kept me glued to the screen the whole way through and does what a lot of movies these days fail at it kept it at a nice reasonable length it didn't drag! Craig's acting and narration were both very good although a lot of other actors in the film did not particually shine through everyone played a ""good"" part required for this movie. It was also very stylish. The only thing i must criticise about the movie is i felt it was over complicated at times i followed it fine and got it all the way through but as soon as i turned off the TV that was it it pretty much left my head! Although that is part of what i loved at the same time the jam packed storyline!

But then it became obvious they did not have an original story so had tried their best to make it so with loads of characters and plot twists and turns. Has anybody read the book? Does the screenplay stick to it? It borrowed from the Ritchie films but also 'The Long Good Friday' which makes for an interesting comparison. In TLGF each development adds to the drama and pushes the narrative along. In Layer Cake I found the constant introduction of new characters and plot twists tedious so in the end I didn't care what happened to any of them. It was also pretty unbelievable at times: Gene, the hardened crim mounts a gun on the wall of his house/office that he used to bump off a fellow crim years ago - really! How does XXXX get the scousers to commit mass murder and still pay him for the tabs? (This is after the head scouse gangster 'didn't want to know' what XXXX wanted a hit-man for!) It just seemed like they had made it up as they went along, that's why I was surprised to learn it came from a successful book.

And Gene, an associate for James Lionel Price, currently employing Mr.X.Mr.X is now on the verge of retirement. Therefore, he is doing his two last jobs as a drug dealer. And those two are dangerous to be in Mr.X's world. He has to face Serbian assassins, backstab his fellows, kill James Lione Price, falling in love with the wrong girl and face some serious management when dealing drugs with chav-wannabe gangsters who has names like The Duke (?). Layer Cake slathers on plot twists with all the restraint of Daniel Radcliffe in a pastry shop. That the intricate narrative loses track of, or simply drops, a couple of its own threads (such as a the missing junkie daughter of Michael Gambon's kingpin Eddie Temple) makes little difference, since Vaughn's film is less concerned with consistency than with stylishly amoral attitude. Craig's ruthlessly witty and charming badass, whose slow return descent into the muck is presented as a preordained homecoming, is largely responsible for making the increasingly outlandish scenarios palatable. Still, it would be nice if filmmakers would call an indefinite moratorium on the now-stale image of spiritually wounded protagonists, desperate to wash themselves clean of sin, mournfully standing in the shower. And at the end of the day, watching Layer Cake is like watching a MTV-version of a Guy Ritche flick. Layer Cake is an excellent gangster flick filled with surprises, plot twists and more surprises. And it also proved Craig's worthiness as an actor. If you loved him as James Bond in the recent film Casino Royale, you'd love him in Layer Cake. This movie proves his Bondness. And so do we.",Layer Cake
157,ravenwood80,not good at all,4,3 August 2005,"watched this with hope in my heart that this was going to be a film that made us Brits proud. One that doesn't make us out to be the royal and posh toffs that most films do. one of the tag lines says its a real gangster movie, ha ha if these gangsters lived round ours they'd last about an hour. They're about as menacing as pigeons. Its not very realistic, even though it thinks it is, and the black guy who plays Monty, a character who is supposed to be brutal and scary looks like an extra from the Cosby show, my Nan wouldn't be scared of him, even if he broke into her house armed with a Uzi. The only person i enjoyed seeing in this was the fella from brookside who owned the chip shop. Even sienna miller couldn't help this, if i made this it would be dark, no humour and disturbing.I'm not going to give away the ending but they built it up using a birds eye view and load music, to try and get an emotion out of you, so you walk out of the cinema or where ever it was playing going, ""oh my god,I can't believe that"".

The right amount of action, humor, personal drama, intrigue, and the best ending of any film I can remember. This is the role of the lifetime for Criag, forget Bond. X , his character's name, is so silky smooth and still so human at the same time, with realistic flaws and desires. A strong supporting cast brings this film to life - eery one of them hits home.

Unsurprisingly enough nothing is what it seems and soon XXXX is running around like a blue-arsed fly trying to keep a variety of plates in the air as Serbian drug-lords, East End crime barons, Scouse pushers and a variety of other low lifes threaten to disrupt his equilibrium. Even with the endless narration it's all a bit much to keep track of, but the film is rescued by fine ensemble acting from a dream cast. Sadly none if it is very convincing and as the mayhem reaches its climax you realise why real criminals don't behave like this: they'd be too busy robbing, murdering and double-crossing each other to get any crimes done and in six months they'd all be dead. This is a film where everyone's trying to be too clever, both characters and director, and it's a shame because the ingredients are there for a splendid movie.Still it's easy to see from this why Craig got the Bond role and he could do well to bring a bit more of XXXX to it.",Layer Cake

I knew nothing of it going in except that the director had previously been involved in a couple films that I wasn't particularly interested in. It first lured me in as a potboiler, then hooked me as the layers began to be revealed. What transpired could have been the intended sequel to Trainspotting. And I mean that as the highest complement. While several films of the past few years showed a studied Trainspotting influence, they lacked originality (they were mostly Hollywood-produced American productions). But this, British one, was different. There's no point in trying to reiterate the plot; it would be one spoiler after another.

Naturally, things go wrong.Review: It's a good movie to watch, but don't expecting anything special. Sit through it on a slow night with a slice of pizza and a cold beer. Not that American light crap though, real beer. Acting is good, story plays out, cockney style dialogues.As to XXXXs death: The angle from which he was shot and the point of impact clearly show that the bullet has hit or rather scratched the sternum then ploughed through his right chest and lung. It was a small caliber so it didn't leave the body. With medical attention he will survive. If they leave him lying on the steps for half an hour he'll die of course. But as this is an English club and not the jungle of Cambodia, paramedics will come, take him to the hospital where he'll be operated and live.Highlight: The dutch drug factoryNotable Actors: Daniel Craig (The Trench), Tamer Hassan (Clash of the Titans), Colm Meany (Law Abiding Citizen), Tom Hardy (Band of Brothers)PS: Would IMDb please include British (or as some call it: English) English to it's spelling program?

Daniel Craig's character XXXX was reminiscent of James Woods in Diggstown and was smooth. I felt compassion for him through out the film and realized who he was and what he was about by the end.Tom Hardy was cool as Clarkie though I really saw him as a supporting character which they really hadn't developed and Colm Meaney is one of the best character actors I have ever seen. I think he may be the George C Scott of the new millennium. If you like watching a fuse light and burn down to the final boom, This movie is definitely worth your time.

165,gainestillinger,Slick.,8,1 September 2009,"Daniel Craig's nameless anti-hero is a highly successful drug dealer who's just about ready to retire. He's a businessman who thinks more like Gordon Gecko than Tony Montana. However, before he gets out for good, his boss, Jimmy (Kenneth Cranham), has one more thing for him to do: find a missing drug lord's daughter and broker a deal for five million Ecstasy pills that have been robbed from a very unpleasant group of Slovakian war criminals... and live to tell the tale. Easy. Matthew Vaughn has brought together a great ensemble of actors for this film who make us laugh, wince and seethe at their antics. The characters are well balanced, with some great contrasts. Craig is suave and cool whilst Ben Whishaw (boyfriend of Craig's new squeeze) is ultra gangly and Michael Gambon's uber-drug lord is grand and sophisticated, whilst Kenneth Cranham's lesser drug lord is crass and blunt. An especially good performance is put in by Jamie Foreman (Nil By Mouth) as 'The Duke'; a wannabe gangster who you'll want to slap really hard in the face. Oh, and Sienna Miller's in it too. She acts well, but being the love interest only gives her a small part in one very disappointing part of the film, which we could have done without.The whole set-up is stylish and nicely filmed. Even second rate clubs are given a sheen and even though we are in London's drug underworld, the place seems really quite glitzy. Not that the film glorifies drug dealing, but there is a feeling that if done correctly and with the right amount of planning one can avoid being hacked up by rivals and instead ride off into the sunset. Get a plan and stick to it - that's Craig's motto; and this being the enjoyable ride that it is, we are inclined to believe him.",Layer Cake
166,Sintz49,Review without anger or long run-through,4,16 December 2017,"Okay, like a few others here, I didn't enjoy this film. But most of the problems I had with viewing seemed simple. They may even have simply been ""American"" difficulties: All the English/Irish accents! And the sound quality furthered the challenge of understanding (I viewed it on cable TV so who knows how the sound crumbled). The there was the Brit Isles' jargon, and any character being referred to by name, nickname, epithets... making it even harder for me to follow the story. The plot was like long sentences I myself sometimes utter, having endless modifying interjections that result in a constant struggle to understand what's happening. Added to this were jump-cuts that skipped through time.
Still, the acting, the camera work, the casting (esp. my first view of Sally Hawkins) ... I LIKED all that; but eventually I had to turn it off. My patience for what seemed to be a too complicated story was reduced also by the setting: such a horrible way to live... ALL criminals?

167,amplexuslotus,Great Film,8,29 December 2006,"I must politely disagree with the previous reviewer who remarked that this film is not as good as 'Snatch' or 'Lock, Stock..' imho this movie is much better in so many ways.....actually in all ways.First of all the acting is top notch & there is absolutely no pretense. Craig is marvelous as a cool but somewhat 'green' gangster. Colm Meany is fantastic (as always) in the role of the seasoned gangster & George Harris is wonderful as Craig's lefthand man. Kenneth Cranham (Jimmy Price) looked so familiar to me yet I still cannot place him. However, I feel this must be a testatment to his profound gifts as a character actor. He is marvelous as the tactless cruel gangster with a love of fine things.For me it is the fact that the script of 'Layer Cake' is far superior to the aforementioned films. Perhaps this has something to do with the fact that the original writer, J.J. Connelly wrote both the novel & the screenplay. Or that the director was very much in touch with the writer's vision & also in tune with not only the very capable talents of his actors but of their possibilties which he brilliantly brought to light in this movie.Michael Gambon's character like his acting prowess, for me, somewhat steals the show. With his extraordinary intelligence, grace & humor - I can't imagine anyone else playing the part. I felt he knew Craig's character (XXXX) better than Craig himself. (Not Craig as an actor but the character which Craig was playing.) Cinematographer, Ben Davis, does amazing gorgeous thoughtful compelling closeups of several of the film's characters. It reminded me of old movies where the face of the actor imported emotion & feeling rather than dialogue. The film sequence after XXXX (Craig) kills Jimmy (Cranham), where XXXX (Craig) is in the shower, was so absolutely beautiful. I was completely mesmerized by the water droplets cascading off of XXXX (Craig). (Yes! I'm not blind! :) Craig has a great physique but the message of that scene was one of a man trying to cleanse himself of wrong doing. Davis' cinematography is simply gorgeous.) I felt that the combination of skillful beautiful cinematography, along with clever intelligent direction & an incredible script which all matched the amazing acting abilities & possibilities (which in my opinion all come to fruition) make this a fantastic film not to be missed.",Layer Cake
168,Mikeonalpha99,"""I'm a businessman whose commodity happens to be cocaine""",7,7 September 2005,"Densely layered just like a layer cake, this new Daniel Craig film has so many twists and turns, with extraneous characters appearing and then disappearing, and a narrative that hurriedly switches backwards and forwards in time, that most viewers will probably be left absolutely giddy from the experience.Admittedly, Layer Cake won't be everyone's cup of tea. The serpentine plot is often hard to follow, but the slick, pulsating production design combined with the raw and often brutal look at the shady underworld of drug dealing, more than makes up for the occasionally muddled narrative.Layer Cake is all about the evolution of a businessman into a gangster, assassin, and double-crosser - a descent that comes as a surprise only to him. The sexy Daniel Craig is perfectly cast as a confident, cock-sure ecstasy dealer, who in an effort to apply solid business principles, treats his trade and as some kind of legitimate commercial practice.As the film opens, Craig is explaining his philosophy in a voice over narrative - ""you keep a low profile, work with people you know, and don't get greedy."" He also announces his attention to retire from the trade, having made enough money from the sale of cocaine and other illegal substances to live comfortably for the rest of his life.But just as he's visiting his bent accountant to have the profits of his last sale transferred into an anonymous bank account, his boss, Jimmy Price (Kenneth Cranham), gives him one last assignment. A buyer needs to be found for a huge consignment of Ecstasy pills that have been stolen from a tulip farm in Amsterdam.Jimmy also wants him to track down the drug addicted, runaway daughter of his friend and corrupt business partner, Eddie Temple (Michael Gambon). Of course, both assignments are setups. Everyone wants to get their hands on the stolen pills, particularly the dealer, a loud-mouthed crook known as the Duke (Jamie Foreman), and their rightful owner, a sociopathic Serb called Slavo (Marcel Iures).Helped by his trusted colleagues, Gene (Colm Meaney) and Morty (George Harris), our anonymous hero must navigate this shady world where no one is as they seem and where everyone is constantly trying to outwit and double-cross each other. There's not much honor among these thieves here, and even those whom our hero thinks are his friends, turn out to be his dreaded enemies.It's certainly Craig's inimitable talents as an actor that keep this threads of the story hanging together, and he gives his character a bluster and conceit that eventually turns into an awkward shuffle once he realizes he's in over his head. But kudos must also go to first time director Matthew Vaughn, who does a good job keeping this complex film moving forward despite its labyrinthine plot structure.Most of the action is seen and told through the perspective of Craig's nameless character, and there are numerous quickly edited flashbacks and shifting points of view, which emphasize the non-linear aspect of the story. A surprise ending will probably leave most viewers quite shocked, but perhaps it's best not to think too much how it fits into the rest of the story, as you'll probably find yourself getting confused.Vaughn also makes the most of the London locales, shooting scenes in posh mansions, crack houses, construction sites along the Canary Warf, picturesque parks along the Thames River, and atop skyscrapers in London's financial district. Viewers who have given up following the story can sit back and enjoy the wonderful views of one of the world's greatest cities. Mike Leonard August 05.",Layer Cake

The characters are brilliantly played out by these actors, the director did well in mixing suspense and comedy and brutal killings into a story which excites viewers, but there is only one thing that could make viewers lost is that the characters name has nicknames and could possibly confuse viewers and sometimes viewers are lost due to this matter.

However, though Vaughn did excite, Daniel Craig is the real star here. The man who SHOULD be the new Bond, Craig turns in a top-notch performance, and his suave attitude and physique bring to mind Steve McQueen, one of my favorite actors. However, Vaughn takes the directing a bit too seriously, and Layer Cake never really takes off the way Lock Stock and Snatch did behind Guy Ritchie, but while this is a slight criticism I loved the movie otherwise. I would recommend this movie for anyone who appreciates gangster movies, and this lovingly crafted plot would make anyone proud. Quality adapted screenplay, not too much violence or language to really upset anyone, but I would not recommend this movie for people who have a hard time with accents as a couple near me did.

The dialog is excellent, the characters are great, even though some are definitely caricatures on occasion (Duke). The plot is just interesting enough to keep you interested throughout the movie. Basically extra sleazy and not very respectable dudes steal some ecstasy pills from a manufacturer in the Netherlands. They bring them to the UK and try to offload them on our lovely hero protagonist. Meanwhile our man (Daniel Craig) is also trying to find the daughter of his boss (or at least occasionally checking in with the dudes he hired to do his job). As you can imagine, the Netherlands guys want their drugs back, and all sorts of other people want the million plus MDMA pills that they have acquired.

There's nothing I can do for people who have and like it.First off- The ending is nearly identical to Carlito's Way.The plot twists are arbitrary, simply there to be plot twists (and there are so many you just don't care about any single character anymore).The main character makes Roger Moore look like the most masculine actor to ever play a ""ladies man"" (FYI- to those of you who might have missed it, Roger Moore is about as Masculine as Harvey Fierstein). Daniel Craig is the British version of Andy Dick, only imagine Andy Dick if he had always been cast in drama.This was the longest movie ever made and it was less than 2 hours, it is an Einsteinian paradox, it absorbs years of your life in its totally co-opted and oppressively dense script. I started watching this 2 hours ago at the age of 31 and I am now 47 years old.There is not an original thought in the whole thing, it's almost as if it has been so widely mistaken for inventive because it takes so much from so many sources that you lose track halfway and in the absolute deluge of convoluted theft made nonsense by the writer you are too dizzied to think it is anything else but genius.

179,Youkilledmypine,"In short, see this film.",9,7 October 2004,"After being cast as Bond, Daniel Craig's back catalogue is now much sought after. Although Craig came to most of the UK's attention with a stand out performance in Our Friends in the North, it's Layer Cake that showcases why he got the Bond audition. Perhaps now, this strong contender for the best thriller of the year may find the audience it deserves. Mis-sold as a more art house friendly addition to the Guy Ritchie school of crime films, Layer Cake is a unique and remarkable experience. The plot is deceivingly simple and would wrongly be placed in the gangster-wanting-to-retire-peacefully cinema staple seen frequently in Al Pacino movies. It is a much greater accomplishment that the audacious visual style, superb script and excellent performances make easy comparisons to this film pretty difficult. If anything it is closer to Schrader's 'American Gigalo' where the morally questionable hero is engulfed in a situation going on around him. The predominantly male cast is faultless with everyone from Dexter Fletcher to Michael Gambon putting in superb turns to give the characters justice. Far more human than the cartoon stereotypes we've come to expect after so very many Brit gangster flicks. Craig has never looked in better shape for taking on Hollywood. Hats off then to Matthew Vaugn for filming Britain as it can look. Grimy in places but every bit astonishing in locations as our Stateside cousins. We've grown too used to seeing rain pouring and hackneyed clichés that have represented this country on celluloid. It's not foppish. It's not Bend It Like Beckham. So there really is no excuse left not to see it (aside from the awful trailer). Layer Cake deserves a wide audience and there's more than enough of everything for everyone to enjoy. At times hilarious, astonishingly frank and incredibly concise the whole film is a pure joy and clearly made for people that love film.

181,MakoMori,A refreshing gangster film that... Takes the Cake,7,5 March 2012,"Layer cake is a film about the middle man in the drug system hierarchy. The narrator (Daniel Craig) has been planning to retire before he even began. He has saved up money by buying, cutting, and distributing cocaine. Just as he is about to follow through with retiring his supplier Jimmy Price (Kenneth Cranham) recruits him to retrieve a friends (Michael Gambon) missing daughter. As well the narrator must secure a deal to sell 1 million ecstasy pills before he can leave the drug game. Layer Cake was the directorial debut of Matthew Vaughn who's most recognizable work is Kick Ass and XMen: First Class. The film is based on the book by the same name and they are both written by author J.J Connolly. Some comparable films are: Snatch, lock, stock, and two smoking barrels, In Bruges. The unexplored territory that Layer Cake offers is what makes this film interesting. Rather than having a character that spirals downward as a result of drugs, the delicate balance of greed and betrayal is presented in a level headed protagonist; who thinks of himself as a business man rather than a criminal. Much like it's name, layer cake presents many different points of view (utilizing cross cut often) showing the layers of the crime world. This includes the drug scene at both different times in history and the different levels of power involved. At times supporting characters can become confusing, although a second viewing would make things clearer. Like his lack of a name the middle man's job is to lay low, make money, and keep things running between the top suppliers and the wannabe gangsters. The narrator becomes a likable character in a normally morally ambiguous genre. The usually fast pace script (great dialogue/monologues) and solid acting pared with some fresh directing makes this directorial debut worth watching. It's few flaws and unique point of view offer a exhilarating perspective in a saturated genre. 7.5/8",Layer Cake
182,lewboskian,Cliché gangster movie,5,28 June 2006,"Daniel Craig was the only highlight of the film as the drug dealer who thinks he can just easily leave the drug game. The ending did leave you guessing up until the very end, but developed so slowly that it seemed you already new about the surprise before the film finally got around to it. The director didn't allow for any suspense or drama to be built up in the film, so the emotional elements of the film seemed to leak out of the movie in every scene and felt devoid of the human element at times. Their were too many elements of the film that have been done again and again in drug/gangster films to hold my interest or make the film seem like an original piece of work. Examples: dropping the F bomb constantly ala Joe Pesci, same camera techniques you'll find in Casino or Goodfellas, attracting the girlfriend of a rival gang or drug dealer, the crew enjoying the spoils of their work over brandy and cigars, double cross after double cross, popular music playing as someone is beaten to death, etc. And the payoff/showdown with the Hungarian Assassin was so uncreative when there was so much potential for that character.

From Dragon to the Duke.A very clever and fast moving plot which some may find hard to follow.

It has a very strong ending, which cannot be said for so many films, which go for a 'nice happy' one eg the only flaw in Micheal Man's Collateral, not to give the ending away -the killing should have been reversed?Faultless acting, directing and photography, with the film starting off with a portrayal of drug dealing as just another business, but by the end of the film its a business that just deals in money and death.

(1). When are movie makers going to stop glamourizing smoking? Are they really so beholden to the tobacco industry that they have no choice? See the scene where XXXX first gets hooked on the girl. (2) Ridiculous ending - forget the arguments about whether it was predictable or not - it was totally implausible to think that Sydney would shoot XXXX in broad daylight - if he was going to kill him you might think he would at least have given himself a chance of getting away with it. (3) Gratuitous violence; the 'Freddy' scene adds absolutely zero to the movie. In fact it takes it from a 6 to a 5 and that's being kind. (4) For the most part very good acting - although Michael Gambon is surely getting typecast. When is someone going to make a REALLY intelligent gangster movie? BTW - IMDb, please update your dictionary - stop insisting on American spellings. All you have to do is add Canadian and UK English - don't tell me that ""glamourizing"" is ""incorrect"" just because it isn't spelled the US way.",Layer Cake
185,keys2494,There's a lot of layers!,6,23 August 2005,"It probably isn't a good thing that I learnt so much in watching this film. Layer Cake is fascinating and is paced so you are always left guessing. The story of a slick drug dealer and a very profitable amount of Ecstasy. Things are going to plan until we uncover a terrible truth about the obtaining of the drugs in question. The slick young dealer, whose name we never uncover, is caught up in this unavoidably down spiraling situation that no one can escape from. All he can do is try to save himself.A truly wonderfully interesting film! This movie really proves how dangerous it is to be in such a business. We all hear about the negativity's that come along with entering the criminal world, but you never really ever get that greater insight. This movie definitely shows; no one is safe, and even when you think you are safe, the most unlikely thing will bring you down. The acting was very good, but in films such as this, I wouldn't go so far as to say that it was Oscar winning. it was realistic, which is all this film really asks for. The lead role played by Daniel Craig is an interesting character. Smooth and smart, but only proves to be as human anyone else. A very excellent use of character and a very good script.An interesting film, I would recommend it. Rather sexually graphic is some areas which put me off a bit. I take into consideration that in such a world, these kinds of things are a reality so I suppose can be excused as a requirement in a film like this. Well done! I would recommend it.",Layer Cake

And he's already sick and tired of the cocaine business, so why does he need ANY of this drama? He should just leave, quit, move out of London. Why does he owe anybody ANYTHING?

188,thedeadpoet,Lacked a spark,6,5 January 2006,"Spoiler Alert! Smart, occasionally funny, and well told story. So why not excellent? This film lacked ""chutzpa"" of the modern stylized crime drama of ""Snatch,"" ""Lock, Stock and two Smoking Barrels"".... and ""Out of Sight."" I think perhaps it was a great twist, or the lack of any character who jumped off screen. This film seemed to try too hard, and attempt too much. I tended to feel the side plots of 'Crazy Larry' and the missing daughter' were really just plot devices, and could almost be eliminated from the entire film. What was Sienna Miller's role? A mindless sexpot who jumps in and off screen with nothing to do with the plot but provide a way to end the film in a surprise death. It does irk me to give this film a low grade because of high expectations, but I just don't think this film had IT. (adn sometimes IT will more than make up for things that some lesser films lack) Daniel Craig was good, I hope he will continue to be slightly creepy in his role of James Bond. .",Layer Cake
189,daveysnoek,Tasty,9,19 October 2005,I was very interested in this film when I saw the trailer and read some stuff about it and I was very much looking forward to it. Unfortunately the movie didn't get a theatrical release in Holland so I had to wait for many more months to see this flick. And when I had finally rented it and watched it I was pleasantly surprised. I love both Lock Stock.. And Snatch so I figured I'd might like it. And I do. After a second viewing it might even end up in my top 20. Matthew Vaughn does a great job as first time directing. He shows the different layers of London from the sleazy gangways to the tall buildings and parks. Every shot looks great with nice camera tricks and so on. Daniel Craig excellently portrays the main character. And he will make a fine james Bond. The soundtrack is terrific. With songs like Ordinary World from Duran Duran (great choiche for the scene it's in) and Gimme Shelter from the Rolling Stones. I highly recommend it.,Layer Cake
190,asylumseeker,A completely silly film,2,21 February 2006,"This film is a waste of time. It pretends to be something other than a normal brainless Guy Ritchie style British gangster film, but that's exactly what it is. It has pretensions towards being something akin to Goodfellas or the Godfather, but it simply lacks the credibility to fall into such a category. The idea that a middle class non-entity like the character played by Daniel Craig could be a successful cocaine dealer is ludicrous to begin with, but the threshold of credulity is well and truly smashed when we discover that the arch-villain in the film is played by a particularly unconvincing Michael Gambon. Gambon comes across as a librarian putting on a fake Cockney accent, not as an established criminal kingpin. This film also tries to be The Usual Suspects by placing twists and turns in the plot, but they are pulled off in such an artificial and contrived way that they just seem absurd. The film is entertaining enough, but mediocre overall.",Layer Cake
191,m.v.hermanni,Well shot and directed but flawed script,6,2 January 2008,"The Movie is very well shot and directed, all Actors deliver flawless performances, but the Storytelling relies entirely on arbitrary Plot Twists. Every 15 Minutes (felt) the Story runs out of Material and is by mercy of the Writers saved for another 15 minutes - for example by some new People or Information of ""whats really going on"" dropping in.While the Movie starts with the classic Film Noir Motive (somebody is hired to find a missing Person which turns out to be a set up), this initial motive is soon completely replaced by the Chase for some stolen synthetic Drugs. And of course more and more dead people that die here and there, to remind that this is a Gangster Movie and not a Schnitzeljagd.Ironically, the main Character first negotiates with the Seller (and Thieve) of these drugs, that they are not worth much - then he wants to steal the drugs himself. He finally succeeds in that. In the end the original Owner of the Drugs is shown how he runs a Factory with mass Production of these Drugs in Netherlands and actually does not care at all about the loss. They might really be worthless.To Top this, the main character is shot dead by some unimportant side kick the moment everything just seems right for him (he outsmarted everybody, left the party at the right moment, got the beautiful girl).Maybe this is the point of this movie: Every story ends by the death of its main character, because every meaning, every success is just his interpretation and there is no other end, it could go on and on.",Layer Cake
192,carlosdev,Slayer Cake,8,9 April 2005,"Gangster movies used to be an American staple; during the heyday of Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney, they rivaled the Western as a particularly American film genre. These days, the British have been making some terrific gangster movies; ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" (on which ""Layer Cake"" director worked as an assistant), ""Gangster #1"" and ""I'll Sleep When I'm Dead"" are gritty and impressive in their own ways. In ""Layer Cake"" Daniel Craig plays a smart drug dealer who has made enough money to retire on and intends to do just that. His supplier, Jimmy Price (Kenneth Cranham) has a pair of last jobs for him; to find the missing daughter of his close friend Terry (Michael Gambon), and to broker a potentially very profitable ecstasy deal with the volatile gangster Duke (Jamie Foreman). Against the misgivings of his right-hand man and back watcher Morty (George Harris) and his own better judgment, he accepts and is shepherded through the process by Jimmy's man Gene (Colm Meaney). Right away things spin out of control and get worse quickly. As with many of the best British gangster films, alliances are made and broken at a dizzying rate, nobody is who they seem to be and nobody can be trusted. Director Matthew Vaughn is impressive, even though there are a couple of moves that are kinda, well, ill-advised, he keeps the pacing fast enough to keep you off-balance much of the time. No wonder Fox offered him ""X-Men 3,"" you can see he has an affinity for action. The cast is competent, and I've gotta say, I've always admired Colm Meaney, from his ""Star Trek"" days on down. He plays a very dangerous man in this one, and you absolutely believe he is capable of doing very bad things. The twists and turns get dizzying towards the end, and the final one comes literally from out of nowhere. ""Layer Cake"" illustrates the strata of British gang-world, from the wealthy bosses to the crack heads in the crack houses, and is believable throughout. Clearly one of the best of an already outstanding crop.",Layer Cake

The camera work in this film felt very new and always kept me entertained especially with the zooms from important moments, the dialogue was exceptional as well in delivery, the actors in this film were all very impressive and the characters fit well in this incredible story (and it shows that it was this film that got Daniel Craig the part as Bond).

195,the_rock456,First Timer,8,9 October 2004,"Before I comment on the film I must first concede that, in the past decade, there have been several examples of stunning directorial debuts (Richard Kelly probably being the most recent). The quality of these films is such that it is indeed difficult to spot the indecision and partial incompetence of the first time director. Well, to put it plainly, Layer Cake does not belong to this category.Matthew Vaughn put himself in a rather sticky position in that he embarked on a project that bore striking similarities to two previous films he produced but did not direct: Lock, Stock and Snatch. It goes without saying that the notable success achieved by those two pictures has been widely attributed to Guy Ritchie's creativity and visual exposition. Indeed it can be argued that Ritchie and his films have become the emblem of the modern British crime genre. It follows therefore that when Vaughn, a producer, decided to make a third film on his own eyebrows were raised. And they were raised for a good reason.Imperfections can, in fact, be spotted throughout the entirety of the film: uncomfortable camera angles, unnecessary cuttings, lack of harmony in the flow of the story lines and, most important of all, some examples of very patchy acting.That said, as a cinematic experience, Layer Cake verged on the brilliant in spite of all its imperfections. The opening sequence may not be faultless nor particularly original but it still provides a sound introduction to the film. Craig's performance, if a bit passive, is sound all throughout the picture. Sienna Miller's brief appearance may not be a tribute to the acting divinities, but it's a surely welcome addition. So is Micheal Gambon's, the cherry on the layer cake. And, despite Vaughn's palpable incompetence, there is one scene - the chase in the warehouse - deserving of at least some credit.6.5/10",Layer Cake

Essentially it's a very standard formula movie. The bad guys keep doing each other in and you can see the irony of the end coming from a long distance. The performances are well done, but I found myself caring very little about these hard nosed criminals. Very little or no feminine energy in the film, and what feminine energy there is is a parody of femaleness. (""Some enchanted evening...you may see a stranger..."")

The film starts out nice and simple but as it progreses it gets quite deep and twisted.I was most surprised by Colm Meaney, I've ever only known him in Startrek.But was superbly cast and had a quite menacing air about him.LC has a few laughs for those with a more twisted sense of humour, it's not obvious comedy either and the film never plays for laughs.

200,movieblitz,Anything Guy can do I CANNOT do better...,3,30 September 2005,"So Matthew Vaughn (producer of Lock, Stock... and Snatch) decides to part company with Guy Ritchie (director of afore mentioned films) and direct his own film. Hmmmmm. Layer Cake could have been a good film and I normally give a film a fighting chance before laying (excuse the pun!) into it. BUT Layer Cake is absolutely convoluted and the storyline is not very interesting at all. Daniel Craig is not believable as the protagonist without a name and the plot has far too many loose ends. The bit where Craig's crony batters a man whose evidence sent him to prison was a pure copy of Vinnie Jones' infamous scene in Lock, Stock. This films only saving grace was the hit-man sent from Holland (but done before in Things To Do In Denver When You Are Dead). What this film needed was sharp editing consisting of quick cuts and lots of memorable music. This would have turned it into a Lock, Stock or Snatch type movie where the editing truly did save the films. If Matthew Vaugn went out of his way to avoid comparisons with Lock, Stock and Snatch than it was a brave move but sticking to Guy Ritchie's template would have ensured a box-office bonanza. I don't rate this film highly at all. Sorry.",Layer Cake

A perfect case of how a great film can be utterly scuttled by the weak willed, cowards who make the thing. This is a great example of the Hollywood cowardice!! If the filmmakers had ANY guts they would not have been great big right wing moralists and given the film the ending it deserves. It is such a disappointment to get the whole way through a great movie only to have it completely ruined in the last moments.It's interesting to note, in the 'Trivia' section, ,the filmmakers did not want to go with the 'Hollywood' ending, yet here it is in all its lame glory.

203,maxwellsmart,Stylish but by the numbers crime movie; a castrated version of the book,6,6 March 2007,"Layer Cake is the first feature film directed by Matthew Vaughn, who made a name for himself producing the crime-comedy classics ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch"". Vaughn abandons the cheeky and comedic nature of those two films and attempts to make a serious crime film. The results are decidedly uneven, as the movie is a stylish but hollow outing.XXXX is a drug dealer who sees himself as merely a businessman whose commodity happens to be cocaine. He's planning on ""getting out"" but right before he can, he's called upon by his boss Jimmy Price to do two more jobs. The simple premise is so familiar that we already know basically what's going to happen, and that's fine, as long as the movie does something to distance itself from the crowd. Layer Cake, however, fails to really set itself apart from other movies in this genreMatthew Vaughn guides the film in a cool, professional manner but it lacks the needed energy. This film lacks the vitality, humor and whiz-bang camera work of the aforementioned Guy Ritchie crime flicks. It also lacks the character development and drama to work convincingly as a straight-faced crime thriller. The problem is that XXXX as presented here simply isn't an interesting protagonist. Make him likable or make him detestable, but don't make him bland and anonymous. The side characters, with the notable exception of the commanding Eddie Temple played by Michael Gambon, are similarly underdeveloped.All this is particularly disappointing given that J.J. Connolly himself adapted his novel for the screen. The novel itself is a great piece of pulp writing. Not only is the nameless narrator a distinct and dynamic character, he is surrounded by other well-defined characters, and the story includes heavy doses of humor and great intrigue and plot twists. Director Matthew Vaughn stated that many of the funny scenes from Connolly's screenplay were omitted in an apparent attempt to distance himself from ""Lock Stock"" and ""Snatch"". Additionally, some of the best characters from the book like Morty and Gene are underdevloped stock characters in the movie, although both George Harris and Colm Meaney do as good a job as could be expected with what they're given.One issue I have is that if Vaughn was so dead set on making this a serious movie there was plenty of material to draw from in order to do a better job of developing and fleshing out the characters. This movie clocks in at about an hour and forty minutes and easily could have been a half hour longer, which would have provided ample time to build drama and make the characters more interesting.While Vaughn has proved himself a director with potential, Layer Cake is a mixed bag. It took an exciting, funny, innovative book that breathed fresh life into the crime-fiction genre and turned it into a shiny, pretty, competent, clinical but ultimately empty and unspectacular crime movie. Certainly watchable but by no means remarkable",Layer Cake

210,BenidictGauchiet,Best British flick since Trainspotting?,7,4 October 2004,"While not perfect, Layer Cake really surpassed my expectations. It's far superior to Snatch or Lock Stock. This is one of the best debuts i've seen in a long time. The style of the movie was just great. Cool costumes, production design, cinematography, music and great, great editing. Stays away from the whole Tarantino lovefest that Guy Ritchie goes for and seems to be inspired by the more hardcore end of gangster flick. Not very original but at least it's nicking elements from some classy gangster movies such as Carlito's Way, The Krays, Performance and Get Carter.

211,AgentCool,Fairly standard fare,6,4 October 2004,"My expectations for Layer Cake were relatively low after viewing the trailer which advertised the movie as a generic British crime flick by suggesting it combines all the run of the mill 'ingredients' that constitute a film of this genre into one 'cake'.A generic British crime flick was more or less what I got. Sure, it was entertaining for a while but it didn't do anything original enough to make me want to see it again or even remember much of it after a few days. The whole premise of the film seemed unrealistic which was a contrast to its realism-focused intentions. The whole organised drugs ring with the head honcho in his mansion seemed far-fetched to me, particularly in Britain, and felt like it was trying to milk off De Palma's Scarface's recent rise in popularity. The few 'shock' moments provide temporary wince-worthy excitement but the thin plot is dragged on for too long to sustain interest despite clocking in at less than 2 hours in length. The characters are generally quite dull with the odd exception and lack the memorability of those in recent Brit crime flicks such as 'The 51st State'. Oh, and if you're a fan of Sienna Miller, the poster and trailer hype of her presence in the film leads to nothing more than an insignificant and pointless bit role lasting less than 5 minutes.Having said all of this, there is no doubt that 'Layer Cake' will attract a huge fan base. Quite why this is I don't know but it is probably because so many people think that any film with drugs, guns and (occasional) babes must be decent. FHM readers will love it, everyone else will be entertained for about an hour, become bored and then forget it.6/10",Layer Cake

213,rad1701,Excellent and involving!,9,27 August 2005,"This movie was terrific. From start to finish it keeps you involved in the ever shifting and deepening plot. Daniel Craig is terrific and from this I can see why he might just be the next next James Bond. He has that same cool under pressure. Plus he just looks like a secret agent, even if he doesn't play that type of role here. The supporting cast was great as well. Keep in mind this movie requires you to pay attention and follow all the moving parts and players. It keeps you guessing from the start to the end. Any fan of detailed plots with bad guys trying to ""do the right thing"" will enjoy this film a lot. The scenery was fun to see as well. You never know exactly where it's all taking place. It has a nice European flair to it. And the music is a mix of various songs that really suit the mood of the scenes. Now I have to go watch it again and pick up the little things I missed the first time.",Layer Cake
214,adhowell,Wasn't this just Carlito's Way in London?,6,15 December 2005,"While I enjoyed watching Craig and especially Gambon, I found this movie to be a British replay of Carlito's Way - all the way down to the Leguizamo character at the end. I'm not sure where you draw the line between plagiarism and an original idea, but this one seemed very close to Carlito's Way to me. Maybe I'm being too critical, or making something out of nothing, but I'd be curious to hear if there were others who found the same similarities. What did make this movie for me were the visuals, the great use of music (very much like Scorcese), and the ominous Serbs. Of course there's also Sienna Miller. On a different note, I think Craig is a fine actor, but Clive Owen would have been James Bond for me....",Layer Cake

The director obviously knew what he was doing because the footage was great as well as the soundtrack which impressed me a lot, especially how well it was used on some scenes. Now the main plot will keep you in your seats the whole movie and there are a few other minor events that make the movie even more enjoyable.

I was therefore pleasantly surprised that Matthew Vaughan learned exactly what not to do from his pal Guy Ritchie's over-rated predecessors. Okay, his direction is nothing special but the pacing of the film and J J Connolly's screen adaptation of his own novel keep ""Layer Cake"" well above average. As is often the case with recent British films (see the excellent Ken Stott in ""Spivs"") it is the excellent cast and their sterling performances that make this film a gem to view. Michael Craig has at last done something that reminds everyone who had such hope for him after TV's ""Our Friends In The North"" that he is one of the finest actors in the country today and Michael Gambon gives a magnificent turn as wise old ganglord Eddie Temple.There are some nice transitional cuts and good use of popular music, but it is the performances and the script's excellent twists and turns that make ""Layer Cake"" one of the most watchable British movies in recent years. Shame about those trailers and posters.",Layer Cake
222,Kinhell,British gangster flick that wont disappoint,9,1 May 2005,"I love British gangster films, I love Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. Layer Cake is a British gangster movie made by the producer of those movies. With Matthew Vaughn actually directing Layer Cake this means No Guy Richie, so does it have everything he puts in his movies to make them what they are? It does and more. Layer Cake for me is better than Snatch and Lock Stock. Its more real and doesn't have such a comedic outlook, which works well.We start by meeting the main character of the film who has no name (Daniel Craig), a cocaine dealer looking to go straight. Of course with any movie where the guy wants to go straight, its not that easy. He gets pulled in deeper than he already is into the crime underworld of London. The local crime lord wants him to find a drug addicted daughter of his friend and also negotiate a deal for one million ecstasy tablets brought into the country by loud mouth cockney wide boy ""Duke"".It all gets complicated in the meantime with Eastern European gangsters chasing anyone who has connections with the tablets, a rival crime lord wanting in on the action and throw in a few scousers for good measure. This forces Craig to take a different role to his usual middle man, and be a player in the whole game.It might sound like a typical plot for a gangster movie, but its the way Layer Cake is executed with all the twists which makes it so good. There is no needless violence just for the sake of the audience expecting it, which you might see in a Guy Ritchie film. When the violence is there its pretty vicious, a scene where one of Craig's associates beats the living crap out of a 'tramp' in a café while Duran Duran is playing in the background is particularly memorable.The actors in the movie are pretty flawless, all playing superb roles, especially Daniel Craig. His confidence and such easy going is perfectly balanced with the predicament he is in throughout the course of the movie.Overall Layer Cake is yet another polished British gangster flick, can Hollywood make something as good? I doubt it. If you are a fan of the Guy Ritchie movies or crime flicks, don't miss this movie.",Layer Cake

Definitely was caught off guard a few times in a good way.Now that he is doing X-Men 3 I have some higher hopes for that franchise.

I cannot rave enough about this ingenious thriller. Matthew Vaughn is going to be one of the greatest directors of our time. The fact that he walked away from Xmen3 to spend time with his family proves that he's a director with heart and isn't there for the budget's sake. Daniel Craig is a revelation and has me convinced that his performance in Bond will be pitch-perfect and the supporting cast complemented his ability. It was good to see Colm Meaney in a role outside of star-trek. The film was a perfect balance overall. And the scene between Sienna and Daniel at the club is great. These two have incredible chemistry. Waiting impatiently for Mr. Vaughn's Neil Gaiman adaptation!",Layer Cake
225,fishnose12,Showing true advancement in British cinema,9,7 July 2006,"It's easy for Layer Cake to become lost in the recent flurry of British gangster movies, including the Vaughn produced Lock, Stock and Snatch. However, Layer Cake's direction shows a true maturity and in my opinion is the best British Gangster film in well over a decade with cinematography and soundtrack working in perfect unison to deliver a true great of British cinema. Not bad considering it's Vaughan's debut.With it's opening assertion of 'Only stupid people think that the Police are stupid.' the film sets the tone for a stark, intelligent thriller that never pulls its punches and uses humour sparsely to break the tension. If Guy Ritchie had directed this, as intended, then I think we would have been treated to something more comedic and wordy, thankfully Vaughan took the reigns and I think we can look forward to some truly exciting work from Vaughan in the future.",Layer Cake

227,PogMoThon3,A pop-gangster retro film with quirky British characters,8,16 August 2006,"North Americans be fore-warned - you may need the subtitles on for some scenes!:) The story line is not particularly original, but the way it is put together is. Lots of underworld bad guy stuff where the main character who is never referred to by name (XXXX), who thinks he is on top of it all and so very knowledgeable and in control, finds out he is not! He peels away layer after layer of the truth throughout the movie much to his shock and surprise as he breaks all his own rules: 'never get too greedy', 'never mix with the end-user' and 'never associate with loud, wannabe-noticed characters' - he is just a regular Joe in over his head and mucks up a lot but turns out all right in the end - or so we are lead to believe. The metaphor also simply refers to the hierarchical levels of the British underworld, each layer receiving more of the ""icing"" than the one below it. It also seems like the higher one goes, the more cool one must act, so the cooler one acts, the higher one goes. Anyone who enjoyed Oceans Eleven will probably like this one.",Layer Cake
228,psycotic_cat,Only Britsh film to rival Get Carter ...,9,17 March 2008,"'Get Carter' is arguably the best British gangster film ever made, as is 'the Godfather'/'Godfather II' for the United States type gangster film. However 'Layercake' is nearly as realistic and gritty as 'Get Carter'. Here is where I make what I believe is a valid point, don't compare this with American gangster films. Both the type and style of film and the gang life itself is completely different. Britain has a much more grittier type crime film than the American counterparts. 'Goodfellas' tends to be considered the greatest rival of 'the Godfather' films, same goes for 'Layercake'. 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is raved about constantly however it is more of a black comedy than a contender with 'Get Carter', despite it's clever depiction of the London Underworld and it's copious amount of thugs and druggies. Without getting any more nostalgic, if that is possible, I recommend this film highly its is real, gritty and well acted. A must see.",Layer Cake
229,Zomanji,Outstanding thriller,9,21 March 2006,"Matthew Vaughan's Layer Cake is one of the better and underrated films of 2004. Daniel Craig plays the lead role, a drug dealer who considers himself a business man who is strictly professional and does not even like to use guns. Craig's character has had enough of the trade and wants to go out on top. However complications arise in a new deal set before him by his supplier and he cannot resist.A complicated and twisted plot revolving around a missing girl, one million stolen pills of ecstasy and who can Craig's character sell these pills too. Craig is upbeat and calm in his role, trying to mediate between varying interests who want to buy the pills or want the pills returned to their rightful owner.The supporting cast surrounding Craig is solid, most notably Colm Meaney and George Harris. The plot seems long and takes turns that you do not expect and have little warning of. I found that refreshing and it kept me wanting more. I never knew what to expect next and Craig played it perfectly trying to work his way through his mess of trying to get rid of these drugs.The ending might but cause some people uneasiness because of its abruptness and sheer lack of predictability (in my opinion). After every mishap for Craig, you are just glad you were able to sift through all the mirages and double crosses in the abrupt ending. The ending is very different from most American films but nonetheless it was fun and unpredictable. 9/10",Layer Cake

At the same time the feel of the movie is derivative of Ritchie in its appearance and ""style"". That being said Vaughn takes the best of Ritchie and mixes in his own brilliant narrative flare and style to complete this complex film. From the opening monologue to the major 180 degree ending, which ill be the first to admit i didn't see coming, this film oozes grit mixing it with the dark gangster crime reality we have all come to know and love. The best comparison for this film is combining Heat with Lock, Stock.

Just a tired Brit gangster movie. There's better writing every week on CSI and Without a Trace. Some of the characters are of interest, but we've seen them all before. Just a bunch of very bad men treating each other very badly. You would be better off renting Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch and watching them again. Please, Madonna, let Guy make some movies again. I think also they should have played it with English subtitles since the accents are so thick.

He uses the dumb cockneys, scousers as Richie has used before him as well as some of the faces from the LSTSB and Snatch films, but the acting here is great, the humour is top notch in a sick way of course, but its there and you can enjoy this film as well as feel sick by it.Daniel Craig should get more film roles on the back of this, hopefully he will go further than some of the lockstock fodder that have not broken though from that film. I can imagine the gangster film bashers hating it, but to me it is a more intelligent update on what you have seen before, although saying that I would now like to see Vaughn doing something else away from the gangster fool genre debut.3.5/5",Layer Cake
233,taxidriver_448,"Flawed, but ultimately enjoyable",7,29 September 2004,"Layer Cake centres on Daniel Craig's character, XXXX (un-named throughout the film), a well-dressed, good looking, charismatic businessman, whose business just happens to be the buying and selling of large quantities of cocaine. In XXXX, we witness a new breed of criminal; he is a long way off Goodfellas' Mafioso family man Henry Hill, and he shares neither Tony Montana's lust for power, nor his psychotic tendencies. XXXX strongly dislikes guns and violence, and is not a typical brash and boastful gangster, instead showing respect courtesy and mainly keeping himself to himself. Craig shines in the role, at times a confident, smooth criminal; at others he is a scared young man in a world that might just be too tough for him.The plot is quite standard 'gangster's last job' stuff: XXXX wants to retire with a small fortune as soon as possible, but first he has two jobs. First, 'The Duke' (Jamie Foreman) has gotten hold of a shipment of ecstasy, and Jimmy Price, XXXX's boss (Kenneth Cranham), needs a middle man to handle the purchase. Secondly, Eddie Temple (Michael Gambon), a major crime boss and old friend of Jimmy Price, wants XXXX to find his missing daughter. Both jobs seem simple enough. But, as usual, things aren't what they seem, and pretty soon the knives are out and the bullets are flying.The cast does a great job; Daniel Craig proves that he is a worthy leading man, and Michael Gambon oozes menace from every orifice. Sienna Miller (soon to appear in a remake of Alfie alongside Jude Law) is both foxy and funny. Colm Meaney (The Commitments) deserves praise as well for his chilling portrayal as Gene, XXXX's muscle and his friend. Also, fans of Lock, Stock will recognise Jason Flemyng and Dexter Fletcher in small cameos. One of the key elements of Layer Cake so great visually is the characterisation of London. Vaughn has ditched traditional shots of Big Ben and Tower Bridge for sumptuous sweeps of the 'Gherkin' and great locations in the Docklands. It is the first London-set crime film in a while that reminds you of just how beautiful London is as a thriving European metropolis, not some scummy underworld. It is also worth noting that the production designer is Kave Quinn, who designed Trainspotting and Shallow Grave.The first half hour of the film is played out Guy Ritchie-style, with slick editing and stylish transitions between scenes. Craig's voice-over is reminiscent of Jason Statham's from Snatch, introducing us to our hero's world and the people who inhabit it.Vaughn has clearly learned from Mr Madonna: within the first five minutes we have been drawn into our hero's world due to great visuals and a stylish soundtrack.So, a slick plot, great visuals, some outstanding performances, and a healthy dose of brutality and black humour to boot. The question is, 'Why didn't I come out of this film with a huge, moronic grin on my face?' Well, unfortunately the answer lies largely in the direction. First-timer Vaughn is, to put it mildly, a bit confused. At times, Layer Cake hurtles along in a slick, stylish manner, with a cool urban soundtrack to aid it. But the film sometimes suddenly veers into an attempt at a thought-provoking character study of XXXX, complete with dramatic sweeping shots and an orchestral score by Lisa Gerrard (co-composer of Gladiator), which is as subtle as a giraffe in dark glasses at a polar bear party. These to styles, although fine individually, jar horribly when put together, and make uncomfortable viewing. This problem at times also undermines Daniel Craig's performance, and it is only Michael Gambon's facts of life speech that just about saves a complicated and confusing ending.As it is though, the muddled direction cannot completely discount a strong cast, entertaining plot, and exciting visuals. Bear in mind that Matthew Vaughn is a first-time director, and Layer Cake becomes a calling card for a great talent in the future.",Layer Cake

This was a British gangster flick at its finest with touches of Cool Britannia.Daniel Craig has shown himself to be a fine actor and I think his portrayal of James Bond will certainly be worth getting a first night ticket.I cannot recommend Layer Cake enough if you like that genre of films - well put together and acted with a good diversity of characters - Sienna Miller's good eye candy and underused (a deliberate act??).,Layer Cake

It was directed well and some scenes took my breath away, I'm not gonna give anything away though :D Gene the main character is played well.For a film with only a £4 million budget, this is impressive.

236,madhurmerchant,"Yes, the title is a metaphor...we get it!",6,18 June 2006,"To be entirely honest, I started to watch this film hoping that I would like it. Love it, even. I wanted so much to enjoy it since it was touted as another Brit gangster flick in the same vein as Lock Stock and Snatch. Also, with the association of Matthew Vaughn with the film, what else could I expect? Before I go on to the bad I will say this: for a first time effort the movie is actually really well done.Having said that, the biggest mistake the director made was to cast Daniel Craig as the lead role. Now I know that this man is the future James Bond and he may very well do great in that role. But, it seems that Craig lacks emotional flexibiity and really acts one-dimensionally. He seems unable to express complex emotions such as joy, shock, fear, or even anger. With a film like this, where the title itself brags about the various layers of complexity within the story, we would expect the lead role to display complexity in his acting as well. Layers is really what it is all about and Daniel Craig fails in this aspect. Moreover, the plot comes off as being way too convoluted. This is especially apparent towards the end. Instead of being taken along for a ride, we (the viewers) are kept at a distance and are never really allowed to feel for a character or take in the various subtleties of the plot. After one plot twist, the viewer isn't even allowed to feel the repercussions of the said twist when we are hit with yet another, and another. Pacing is very important and the movie fails to achieve a good pace.I suppose I should end with something positive. So here it is: Sienna Miller is too fine...goddamn!",Layer Cake
237,mooand,A new type of movie,10,8 November 2005,"Much like modernism in literature formed as a reaction to romanticism, Layer Cake was written as reaction to terrible films. Firstly, Layer Cake is superbly directed, showing some of the more cinematic, less clichéd sides of Britain, and brilliantly acted by a host of incredible British actors. However, where Layer Cake truly shines is in its writing. No, it may not be the witty dialogue of Richie or Tarantino and the plot may not be a complex web of faulty info etc. etc. What Layer Cake does is that it makes sure that the audience has no way of knowing what will happen next. In some many scenes I was ready for one thing, seeing as it is the norm in gangster movies, and what I received was something far different. It is unique. For example, Sienna Miller is featured in the film solely for one scene and the ending. There is a teasing scene where she shows up for no reason to have sex with Daniel Craig. At this point I was thinking 'great, this is just falling into action movie style.' How wrong I was. The director gives us just enough so that we are very ready for a hot sex scene when...boom, Craig is knocked out and dragged away by people who have nothing to do with Miller. THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN IN FILMS! Every single person in the room collectively screamed 'NO!' at the screen when this happened. Do not expect anything. Another example: just after coitus interruptus, Craig comes face to face with Michael Gambon, in a role slightly different than the lovable Dumbledore. In this scene, Gambon has to give a great deal of exposition in a classic monologue starting with some philosophical metaphor that makes the audience go 'oh...that's clever.' This technique was really first capitalized fully by Tarantino and has been copied every time since. As the speech began I thought 'another boring speech.' WRONG. Immediately as Gambon asks Craig if he knows what a remora fish is, Craig answers 'YES'. Impossible! So anybody watching who is unfortunate enough not to know what a remora fish is, is left in the dark. This is a small example, but I noticed it immediately and it was jarring, to say the least.Finally, the movie ends. Craig wins, gets the girl, gets the money, gets the power, kills the baddies, etc. etc. etc. Yet another happy gangster ending...WRONG. Boom, out of nowhere he gets shot...and dies. You never even know his name. Layer Cake is a tornado of logic, excitement, entertainment and Brits, a perfect recipe for such a modest delicacy. Tell everyone you know to watch this movie. It is incredible.",Layer Cake

240,mcbainbmr,Frustratung but beautifully crafted,10,13 July 2016,"Forget - if you will - that Guy Richie had anything to do with this near- cult British gangster film. It is at once intelligent, witty, gloriously filmed and framed, and at the same time infuriatingly complex and annoying.Daniel Craig, in his last film before his Bond days, is very clear about his role in life. He's a businessman, who happens to deal in cocaine. He doesn't consider himself to be a gangster, and as his commentary at the start of the film reminds us: ""stay as far away from the end user as possible"". He hates guns too, and believes himself to be the gentleman baddie.So does Jimmy Price. Jimmy's empire is built, much like a pyramid scheme, on getting other people to do the dirty work while for all to see, he is a paragon of larger-than-life businessmen done good. He just has one or two little jobs for Daniel to do though, before (unbeknown to Jimmy) our hero plans to retire. Yes this is a ""one last job before I retire"" sort of film.Firstly, there's the drug-addled daughter of his old school friend, Eddie Temple (played with gloriously latent menace by Michael Gambon). She's gone missing from a rehab clinic, and Craig is called up to find her, at whatever cost.Added to Craig's ""to do"" list is the little matter of one million ecstacy tablets that have found their way from the clutches of a ruthless Eastern European gang into the possession of ""The Duke"", a loud-mouth ""throwback"" accompanied by his motley crew of droogs, not least a very very unpleasant girlfriend who would be kicked out of the Jeremy Kyle Show.Having spent the first 45 minutes establishing who is who, what is what and so on, we settle down to witness a descent into ever decreasing circles of cross, double-cross, and nobody really knowing who to trust; Craig (who is never named in the film) remains calm throughout proceedings while - to quote The Duke - things go ""a little bit turbo'.It would spoil the ending too much to say more. Michael Gambon, suffice to say, has been watching events unfold from a far, as has Serbian killer ""Dragon"" who has a perchant for chopping off people's heads and doing some very very nasty torture using an electric iron.Sienna Miller acts as a tagged-on romantic sub-plot, but as pointless sub- plots go, she's certainly lovely to watch.This film is not easy going. The ending, which I shall not divulge, crackles with the ""this is what will happen if you mess with me"" from Craig vibe. It is rumoured the Barbara Brockly chose Craig to be the next Bond on the strength of his last words in the film and the rest, as they say, is history.",Layer Cake

Like much of the crap that comes out of that upper middle class system that professes to be the British Film Industry (it started back in the day with the BFI with all its cronies and has genetically modified into where we are now with the so called British Film Commission). Welcome to yet another British fascination with the gangster, drugs yawn formula. Do we do anything else in Britain?This movie starts well, but soon becomes an exercise in style over content. Some scenes are so ridiculously caricatured, that they are laughable. If only it was funny. Sadly, the director decided to ditch the humour early on in development in an effort to create a serious gangster flick. But it's not really serious. It's just pretend serious. 'Sexy Beast' is a far more convincing portrayal of a group of serious psychopathic gangsters. Layer Cake is more like a film version of a mid-week episode the BBC TV series, Eastenders.Layer Cake feels like it's directed by a producer rather than a director. Someone who pushes all the buttons but has no idea why, what for, or even whether he should. Oh, he is a producer. Sorry. This guy could have poetry books fall on his head from a great height and would call the police professing he was being assaulted. Directing a movie is more than being sat on the sidelines ordering stock for two movies and then thinking, ""do you know what Matthew, I reckon we could do this directing malarkey"". At least Guy Ritchie, with all his faults, managed to inject a feeling and a sense of crafting a scene. You come away from his flawed films feeling that he has a vision of sorts. With Layer Cake, I came away imagining creativity by some committee, and although we're told in the interview of Matthew having referenced many movies its never with a real understanding of what made those moments he sourced special. There's no magic. Its all very well working with your mates and pointing out what a team effort it is making a jolly good British film, but the closer a film is to a singular vision, even if its wrong, the more character-rich and personal a film becomes. A director's job is not just to make friends with all those nice people around you (that's a producer), a director's job is to stand alone and isolated and nervous as to whether you made all the right choices and the most creative decisions.If directing is an enjoyable experience during the making of the film, you might have to ask yourself the question, ""am I really a director?""Still, if its not really working, you can always throw in a load of violence (like having a camera's head kicked-in as in 'Goodfellas'), coupled with a ton of popular semi-underground dance music, and make sure you shoot in anamorphic widescreen because it sounds good (against the advice of all those professionals around you who were indirectly but politely trying to tell you, not to do it because you don't deserve to do it). Anyway, it jolly well impressed the hell out of the film-editor of 'Time Out' magazine.It's a shame cause there's a good cast, interesting locations, and even the cinematography's not half bad. It's just missing a director's vision. My advice to Matthew Vaughn is to stick to what he does best, producing, and find great directors to produce. There's a load of good ones (some of the best in the world) already working in British TV commercials. But maybe that's a little late now that he's crossed the line. Which talented director is really going to want to work with a producer who's a frustrated wanna-be director?We have a history of being the birthplace of some of the great world-class filmmakers from Alfred Hitchcock to David Lean, from Nicolas Roeg to Ridley Scott, and more recently from Jonathan Glazer to Chris Cunningham to name but a few, if we are to continue this line we need to ensure that the talented receive opportunities rather than the well poised and well positioned.Layer Cake is overrated and soulless, but worth a watch if just to glimpse at what the British Film Industry could be like. Now where's are those directors who feel its a closed industry and not for them. Round them up.Tally Ho",Layer Cake
243,videoexecutive,The anti-Bond film.,8,20 November 2005,"This is a solid and entertaining (and yes, layered) film that greatly showcases the future Bond, James Bond. Craig comes off here as the anti-Bond, not smooth, not always knowing what to say and not always doing things the right way.I was relieved to see this when I watched the film, especially knowing while watching that he has been already chosen as the next Bond. As a true Bond-fanatic, it was refreshing to see Craig's performance not be an audition for the super-spy, instead, it's a very mellow and understated solid role.This should help Craig create his own version of Bond in the time to come.While sharing traits of Matthew Vaughn's usual film-making partner Guy Ritchie, Layer Cake stands on its own two feet as a convoluted, funny and engaging piece.Worth the rental.",Layer Cake

I actually didn't get to it at the cinema but after a friend of mine saw it on DVD and loved it, I had no hesitation in buying it and I'm so glad I did.The characters are all perfect - believable without being over the top or dull.There is no wasted space, every scene contributing to the overall film essence.The locations, filming, lighting, music are all done beautifully.In fact only in one scene is there a perhaps unnecessary quick widepan shot - everything else is paced to match the scene it is based in.I wouldn't say you'd love this if you loved Lock stock, snatch et al but rather if you found the new wave of British gangster flicks a bit hard to warm to, liking ""cake"" first may well give you the enthusiasm to revisit such past efforts.Matthew Vaughan has done something wonderful and no mistake!",Layer Cake

Maybe it's the fact that this is a film noir masquerading as a London gangster flick that sets people off; maybe it's just the plot similarity between this and the Guy Ritchie oeuvre.Either way, and even though Layer Cake has been generally well-received, I don't think the film has really garnered the appreciation it deserves. Acting performances are solid throughout, and Daniel Craig turns in a particularly convincing performance as the nameless protagonist. Michael Gambon, Colm Meaney, and George Harris also deserve special mention. The script moves smoothly and understandably while always holding your attention. What hooked me, though, was the aforementioned blend of film noir and gangster genres. The movie would be an excellent entry in the gangster genre if that's all it were, but adding a femme fatale (Sienna Miller) into the mix alters the film's trajectory ever so slightly - one form of temptation, rather than another. And in the end, that little shift is what changes this movie from good to great.",Layer Cake

She agreed, so we sat through the clichéd characters (stolen, lock stock and two smoking barrels, from Guy Richie's far superior film), wooden acting, dire dialogue, desperate direction, tiresome plotting and laughable attempts at any kind of believability or realism. Then after an hour and a half, we could take no more and left. Perhaps it improved immeasurably after that but in the end, life is just a bit to short to spend even a nanosecond watching such pisspoor film-making.The plot seems to involve Daniel Craig's drug dealer character (Billy?) completing one last score before retiring (yawn). Various obviously- telegraphed and poorly justified plot twists occur. Some people kill some other people. There's a major assassin on the the loose who can get your mobile number but not your address. Sienna Miller turns up, apparently just to get changed into some saucy underwear, then we don't see her again (maybe she reappeared after I walked out, but three minutes out of ninety is a pretty flimsy performance to market the entire film around). Aaaaaaaanyway... You've seen all the characters before, done far better in other movies. The supposedly cool lines are always very self-conscious and fall well short of the level required for the cool lines genre. The direction tries really, really hard to be creative and original, but is simply woefully amateurish (one shot zooms in on Craig's eyes; when we pull out, he's in a different scene. Brilliant, Mr Vaughn. Scorsese: give up now. You'll never come close to such genius). The acting is strictly cardboard cut-out level. You could excuse the actors due to the poor material and director they had to work with but these are generally very good actors, each magically turning in their worst work to date (Craig even overacts in a balaclava, showing only his eyes. Quite a feat).I could go on but I think I've said enough. Don't go and see this film. You'll only encourage them.",Layer Cake

Don't expect an easy watch though, pay attention, as there a few clever twists and a couple of dual sequences that take place. The cast play there parts superbly, Colm Meaney has come along way from O'Brien on Star Trek, Daniel Craig has that an extra quality that makes you forget that he's not got the typical sex appeal of someone like Brad Pitt, Sienna Miller is a sexy choice for the 'love interest'. The older generation, Kenneth Cranham and Michael Gambon don't let the side down either, playing suave, but hard men who've been in the game a long time and know how to play it.In my opinion this is better than Lock Stock, with a better story, varying scenes from standard dialogue, to fast paced, excellently shot action sequences and the clever twists keep your attention. For boys and girls alike, this is definitely worth seeing on the big screen.A big 'Well Done' to all concerned.",Layer Cake

Yet, as is usually the case with the 'one-last-job' style crime movies, he is halted in the midst of this quiet exit by, you guessed it, one last job. The maelstrom that ensues is everything XXXX has worked to avoid over the course of his career.Our nameless narrator is everything that most people would least come to expect from a typical gangster. He is not loud, he is not avaricious, he sees the drug game as a business and nothing more, ""I'm not a gangster. I'm a businessman whose commodity happens to be cocaine."" However the last job he takes sees him dealing with his polar-opposites, those who are in the business for, as he sees it, the wrong reasons. Their desires extend well beyond what anyone can consider cautious and they are involved ""to be a face, a name."" As one might remember, Frank Lopez in Scarface had a word for these kind of people, 'chazzers.' Those who want more than they need. And, as one might remember, Tony Montana did not heed Lopez's advice and it ultimately led to his downfall. XXXX, however, does follow the drug-dealing codes. Yet, will he be able to keep his human flaws in check? And even if he does, will he still see his own downfall before he is able to leave the drug business?

253,jeffwpatton,"Sharp, Cool, and British",9,10 October 2012,"""Layer Cake"" is, simply put, a cool movie. With razor-sharp dialog and Daniel Craig in one of his best roles (in my opinion), this is a movie that requires its viewer to think for a bit. And although the plot is a little convoluted, that doesn't take away from the overall experience. While it certainly helps to understand what's going on, you don't necessarily need to to enjoy it.This is a pre-Bond Craig, and even though I think he's fantastic as Bond, I thought he was even better in ""Layer Cake."" His character has more personality and I felt I could relate to him a lot better. This character(who remains unnamed throughout the film) has doubts, fears, and frustrations just like anyone else, and the way he deals with them is very human. He's just a normal guy who happens to be in an abnormal line of work. There's also a sort of snazzy sort of charm from the cast as a whole. Colm Meaney and Michael Gambon were particularly good. Each character has their own distinct personality, and none of them felt terribly short- changed. Overall, ""Layer Cake"" is just a cool movie. If you ever have the chance to see it, do.

The acting, directing, soundtrack, cinematography all works wonders for this movie. I expected just another Drug/crime movie, what I got was a movie about individualism, manipulation, trust, and other related themes. This movie is a wonderful ride, and I was on the edge of my seat right up through the ending. This movie however has a few faults with it.

I am really looking forward to seeing Vaughn's future works as he has surpassed Guy Ritchie's latest efforts with this one film.

The narrative that runs through this film keeps the whole thing together so that you actually feel for Daniel Craigs character even though he is a drug dealer!

257,eYeDEF,"Is drug dealing a game you can just pack your bags and be like ""sorry mates I'm through""?",9,19 December 2007,"Actually, you can.In fact, true ballers high enough in the drug chain with any intelligence and foresight do plan to get out on their own terms. But due to greed, convenience, ego, fantastical thinking, love of living large, and myriad other rationalizations such a noble goal is unattainable to everyone but the most disciplined few.Rare. But it does happen.That's what I really like about Layer Cake and Daniel Craig's character in particular; he's sort of living out the ultimate fantasy of every enterprising illegal drug dealer on the planet with greater ambitions. He views his profession not as a lifetime occupation (who grows up wanting to become a drug dealer anyway?) but strictly a temporary means to raise enough seed capital to nurture his own entrepreneurial ideas into legitimate, commercially profitable enterprises. This happens more than you might expect in the real world as many successful companies past and present, all around the world, including perhaps a disproportionately large number in the entertainment and music sectors, received their initial round of funding through ill gotten gains. Well documented are companies where the founders themselves, ex post facto statutes of limitations, reveal the key ingredients behind their success in interviews, memoirs, or tell-all book deals. As Craig's character says with typical aplomb in his money line: ""I'm a businessman whose commodity happens to be cocaine.""From the beginning he spells out his recipe for success in narrating a few golden rules, teaching the uninformed viewer about a doctrine seared into the mind of everyone familiar with success in this very specialized industry:""Always work in a small team. Keep a very low profile, only deal with people who come recommended. It's like selling anything: washing machines, hand-made shoes, blow-jobs. As long as you don't take the pis people will always come back for more. That's not to say we don't weave that magic that makes two kilos into three, but never be too greedy. Know and respect your enemy. It's only very, very stupid people who think the law is stupid. And avoid like the effacing plague loud, attention-seeking wannabe gangsters, in it for the glory, to be a face, to be a name.""I think of slinging for men much like stripping is for women. It's a young person's game since it's easy money, you can work your own hours, and is next to impossible for most people to get out of once you've experienced life in the ultra fast lane. And following the golden rules while founding, saving, and re-investing in legitimate enterprises while setting a cap on your earnings when you force yourself to get out and get out for good is the province of only the most driven, organized, and ultra-disciplined elite.But it is possible, and it does and has happened.Which is where Daniel Craig's character comes to play; as the living on-screen embodiment representing all the characteristics that should provide him a recipe to succeed as a member of this revered elite. Possessing his trademark aura of coolness in the film that would make him a future Bond, Craig infuses in his character the work of a natural; a cunning business acumen with the prescient ability to think a step ahead while maintaining a healthy dose of paranoia as required to excel in the game. This player is so good, you're bound to even forget his name, except, when you discover that even an elite like himself will still be subject to the countless temptations, machinations, manipulations, and those pesky golden rules that always threaten to mess up his game.And that's where the fun ride begins. Only the very ending, which, as a matter of taste and style some liked and others hated with my opinion siding squarely in the latter prevents me from doling out a perfect grade. But unlike some movies, the ending is not a fatal flaw since it doesn't ruin the rest of the movie. It's still well worth watching, especially to those looking for the future James Bond's precursory role. Peeling back the layers of intrigue of the Layer Cake(2004) takes you for an always engaging, very entertaining ride!9/10",Layer Cake

Layer Cake works in that it sets out to portray the ""Champions League"" of the drug world, and succeeds. Other than a higher than normal body count, it captures the very essence of the subject. With the possible exception of the part and story line of Eddie (Michael Gambon), the atmosphere the film creates is horribly accurate - although the truth is worse and better, etc.Perhaps the point at which it comes closest to reality are the few seconds filmed outside the Regency Cafe - when XXXX finds himself in a situation which is not only out of control, but also where he is suddenly alone and in a great deal of trouble. The virtual 360 degree camera pan here is amazingly effective - and combined with the final cords of Duran Duran's ""Ordinary World"" (!) it captures the feeling of isolation perfectly.Indeed, the beating inside the Cafe must also rate as one of the best uses of a sound track in any film.

The director Matthew Vaughn has moved onto bigger and better things by blockbuster mass audience standards but in my opinion this is his finest work. The films strongest asset is its magnificent supporting cast which parallels the standards of Guy Ritchie's 'Lock Stock' and 'Snatch'. Some of the roles are so minor and screen time is minimal, but the performances are so memorable. George Harris and Michael Gambon are the stand outs. Added to the line up is Tom Hardy, Ben Wishaw, Burn Gorman, Jamie Foreman, Kenneth Cranham, Stephen John Sheppard, Stephen Walters and although i can't stand him in anything else, in this case the list has to include Colm Meaney. This list of who's who goes on and on with the usual suspects Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher and Tamer Hassan cropping up. Sienna Miller steals the show with her memorable lingerie scene. As Jeremy Clarkson says on Topgear when interviewing Sienna Miller, ""everyone remembers that scene"". To conclude the master class of acting talent, the final say has to go to Liverpudlian Louis Emerick whom i haven't seen on screen since soap opera Brookside was on television.

271,crehandonall,Great? I'm Sorry but What?,5,16 March 2005,"This is a sub-par effort by mister Vaughan, but in Fairness, I'd lay most of the blame at the door of the writer. The set up is ingenious, the layers are built up subtly and without letting the audience know what is going on. That finishes around the hour mark, pretty much bang on the end of Act 2. The denouement is a mess. Its unsatisfying, unconvincing, and crowned with an almighty tin hat. The ending, which was weak up until the last scene, smacks by the time the credits roll of a shiny pulp con/thriller that has suddenly, at the urging of its girlfriend or mother perhaps, gotten ideas above its station. If the purpose of the ending is to make a statement about criminality, then it is totally at odds with the way criminality has been treated throughout the film. Now maybe the filmmakers thought this was a final, almost metaphysical reveal, and maybe it could have been, but the way it is done just jars, and the tonal inconsistency leaves you annoyed rather than intrigued or impressed. So fall asleep after an hour and dream the ending, you'll have a better overall experience.Solid from Vaughn though, and provided he's working off a better script, this bodes well for X3. I wonder did Fox plump for him cos they wanted another director with a background in crime movies who could handle complex story threads. If X3 is anything like X2, the director is going to have to have skills akin to an orchestra conductor.",Layer Cake
272,liam_mcgough,British gangster film with true class,9,18 March 2005,"I didn't want to see Layer Cake, but it was the first film on when we got to the cinema and my friends persuaded me. The promotion hadn't done it justice and I thought it was going to be Snatch's ugly sister. A ""lads"" film. The style of the film, locations, way it was shot and way it portrayed British gangsters completely changed my mind and I was hooked. Some of these things cover the minor problems the film has with plot and characters at times. However, these were still good. Generally, the characters were well presented and I liked the multiple twists. It is a lads film, but with icing on top. A few people have said that they like the end, for a variety of reasons. I felt it was one of the weakest points (the weakest being Terry's Irish joke towards the end). Also, why would Gene be driven around in such an old 5 series? Nothing can be perfect and Layer Cake isn't, but what it's got it does well. Same genre as Lock, Stock and Snatch but on a different level. Lock, Stock is the chav girl down the pub that you might have a night with after a couple of pints. Snatch the very attractive girl next door who you bump into one night on the way home, or maybe a stripper who asks you back to a hotel (free). Layer Cake the best looking girl in the office who seduces you at an office party and takes you back to her riverside apartment. It makes you want people in other countries to see it, to see what we've got. and it's got Sienna Miller in.",Layer Cake
273,barry-ward,Disappointing,2,11 April 2005,"Very weak, disappointed by the ending, some funny moments but the promo belies the amount of screen time that Sienna Miller is given. Couple of good moments but on the whole could have gone straight to the remainder bin.Michael Gambon plays an archetypal ""godfather"" bit, and there were a couple of plot twists that I wasn't expecting, but I think the hype surrounding the film was definitely just that - ""hype"".Certainly, the film didn't deserve the kudos lavished upon it by all and sundry.Without giving the end away, all three endings included on the DVD were predictable, and there was a hint of plagiarism about it - very similar type of ending to the Long Good Friday, if you get my drift. Actually, come to think of it, there were a lot of similarities in the progress of the film with the Long Good Friday.",Layer Cake
274,OzarkSavage,A great complex British gangster film,9,4 September 2005,"Daniel Craig is the drug dealer with no name in this brilliant British gangster flick. The plot begins as the run of the mill guy wants to get out of the business story, but like the title suggests there is more than a couple of layers to what is happening around him. Of course he gets asked to do another job by his boss, to whom no is not an acceptable answer.Being touted as the next big brit-film in the vein of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Layer Cake is more a spiritual successor to movies like Long Good Friday and Get Carter taking a more serious route rather than having all the stereotypes played for laughs. Don't get me wrong those stereotypes are in there, just not played tongue-in-cheek. With the Exception of The Duke.Daniel Craig walks through the movie with a cool smoothness only comparable to the likes of Steve McQueen or Eastwood. You can also see why his name has been linked with James Bond in recent days, as in one scene it seems one look from his blue eyes and one girl is offering herself to him. And you know what, you believe he could get a girl that easily.Other performances are also of very high standard. Especially Colm Meaney and Michael Gambon, very different from being Dumbeldore.The direction from Matthew Vaughn is excellent and not overloaded with the visual flair often used by Guy Ritchie. There a little touches here and there which work brilliantly in the context of the film.The Good: Performances, direction, story are all tight and well handled. The Bad: May take a second viewing to catch all the layers. But that isn't a terrible thing. The Ugly: Gangsters aren't the prettiest men in the world. And fouled mouthed too.Overall: Highly Recommended 9/10",Layer Cake
275,jdesjar,A good Brit Flick,8,2 April 2005,"I watched Layer Cake yesterday. Ordered it from amazon.co.uk and my mac is mysteriously setup to play all the region codes, so...A good flick. It's nice to look at some quality movie that isn't a produce of the US cinematografik meat grinder these days. A lapsus? Perhaps! A foreign flick, Layer Cake comes in its own original English version. No subs needed here. Unless Hindi (or a better understanding of the tongue of Shakespeare) is what you are looking for.Granted, the scenario is a little complicated for us North Americaners, but with a little concentration and effort I managed to get the story.A bit gloryifing the drug trade in the beginning, I found that soon enough, it depicted pretty well the hell world those involved in the illicit occupation often find themselves in. This movie portrays a somewhat realistic picture of the high stakes of the drug trade. British cinema is back!Highly recommended, any foreign buff should definitely take the time to watch.",Layer Cake
276,mhairirobertson,fast paced crime movie with tons of characters thrown in.,5,23 April 2005,"This was a very flash, fast moving movie. Didn't quite hide the fact that the beginning was a rip-off of Fight Club, the voice-over and ending was pure Carlitos' Way and you are reminded of Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels all the way through. The director didn't seem to have any ideas of his own. Good performances, though, and it was lovely to see Mick from Brookside again!! Most of the actors were playing to type, and could probably play these roles in their sleep, particularly Colm Meany and Michael Gambon. I really wanted to like this movie, but ended up being annoyed at how many different things were ripped off from other directors. Disappointing.",Layer Cake
277,citizen912,"In Short, Delicious",8,1 May 2005,"What can I say a plot that twists subtly but with increasing violence towards a totally out of the blue conclusion, beautifully shot with superb attention to lighting and excellent sound work. Not expecting too much from the magazine ads and the rather lame DVD artwork I have to say I was very surprised not to see another guy Ritchie style stab at the menacing side of the British underworld. Seems the writer has a talent for the gritty realism that Mr Ritchie's screenwriters seem to be lacking. Colm Meeny was tremendous as a brooding, dark and extremely menacing underworld lieutenant with a very dark past that was touched on in the latter stages of this film. A very scary Michael Gambon nudged upon the politics and scheming which allow both legitimate and illegitimate persons to gain huge amounts of power and influence in our society very subtly and with no need to go for the usual histrionics such a character is usually portrayed with.",Layer Cake
278,nick_offord,"Best British gangster film since Lock, Stock.",7,3 May 2005,"Over the last ten years British cinemas have shown many gangster films. Some have been good (Snatch) but some have been bad, very bad (Essex Boys). Guy Ritchie's (Mr. Madonna) Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels started a trend of British gangster films back in 1998 but since then most of the other offerings have been average at best.This is where Layer Cake is different. Matthew Vaughn's film is the best gangster movie I have seen in the last five years. It has reinvented the genre, a genre that seemed to have gone the way of other late 90's trends like garage music and Manchester United winning trophies. It focuses on 'XXXX' (Daniel Craig), a drug-dealer who sees himself more as a businessman than a gangster. Just when he thinks he is retiring from the criminal underworld, he is pulled back in for one last job.The acting in this film has often been called wooden but I tend to disagree. Craig, among others, puts in a good performance and there are excellent performances from Colm Meaney, Michael Gambon and Dexter Fletcher ('Soap' from Lock, Stock).Overall the film is a good critique of the gangster milieu but is expressed in a satisfyingly subtle way. Don't expect the witty one-liners of Snatch but do expect gritty realism and an intelligent dialogue.",Layer Cake
279,joe_x13,most over rated film ever made?,1,13 May 2005,"first of all, who can spot the guy who fronted the money for snatch and lock stock, but who actually had no input whatsoever, who then went on to make layer cake... you guessed it. i was almost reduced to tears watching this film, the acting was uncomfortable to watch, and as for the script! if a good script consists of somebody saying 'FUCK!' every three lines then this ones a winner. the direction was straight out of the 'how to shoot Kensington glamorously' handbook and lacked any intervention. Anyone notice the subtle advertising? this film lacked a plot, a script, direction and decent actors which doesn't really leave it with much. how could he ever be compared to Tarantino? Guy Ritchie understands the characters he writes about but Vaugn sucks. go back to Sloane square you phony. Big up to Guy Ritchie - buk buk!",Layer Cake
280,captainbojangz,Real life gangsters,9,3 June 2005,"Matthew Vaughn, instead of following the same formula that ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" did with its flashy editing sequences and ultra stereotyped accents, delivers a film that is intelligent and real. Vaughn, obviously a talented director, is able to show the anxiety of being a day-to-day gangster as well as the uncertainty that goes along with the job. Guy Ritchie's films had little substance to go along with their abundant style. I felt that the films were too ""cute"" with their dialog and direction. ""Layer Cake"" on the other hand, delivers something that is rare for a movie these days: equal amounts of substance to make the movie interesting as well as an abundance of style to make it vastly entertaining.",Layer Cake
281,jamistar313,This Film is Ridiculous and Not Worth Your Time,4,7 June 2005,"Considering there are so many better suspense films out there, in particular from these producers, Layer Cake is a complete disappointment. It tries way too hard to be ""cool"" or ""edgy"" and comes across instead as cheesy and melodramatic. How Snatch and Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels can even be related to this film is unbelievable. The acting is at times laughable, and the plot is so convoluted, only in a film would it be possible to be this ridiculous. If all you want to see are some crooks with a few hot English stars thrown in the mix, go ahead and see this film. If you'd rather not waste your money, I'd suggest another.",Layer Cake
282,damienrice07,IMDb quotes are inaccurate,7,7 July 2005,"I don't know who writes quotes for IMDb, but these are awful. The person who wrote them can't spell, can't write, and made horrible mistakes in the actual wording. Maybe I'm mistaken, but last time I checked, quotes were quotes. They should be copied down verbatim, not just however the person writing them vaguely remembers them to be. I saw Layer Cake about 2 weeks ago and I still remember the phrasing and overall ideas in the film being entirely different. Why would such an authoritative source give such inaccurate quotes? Where am I supposed to find quotes if I don't own the movie and IMDb, THE internet movie source, doesn't have them written correctly? I just think this is a problem that should be fixed. Don't you agree?",Layer Cake
283,jirca87,An extremely intelligent crime drama,10,28 January 2006,"I was skeptical before watching this and almost didn't, and I'm extremely glad I decided to after all. While it's only an hour and a half, it made me feel as though I just felt a 2-3 hour movie in terms of plot in a good way. I first time I watched it and was a bit confused about some things, but I watched again the next day with subtitles, and everything became clear.Its plot is so rich and the characters are so intriguing that once it started, I couldn't take my eyes off of it. The music is mixed into the movie extremely well, really enhancing the experience and what's going on. I wouldn't recommend it to those with really short attention spans though.",Layer Cake
284,mcinman,A man looking to leave the highly volatile drug business sticking around for one more job.,10,21 March 2006,"One of the best movies of the last decade. Top-notch directing, talented acting and fantastic dialog make this an absolute must-see. Matthew Vaughn, incorporating a Guy Richy-esquire look to the picture, triumphs again with a movie similar to his previous work ('Snatch', 'Lock, Stock, and Two Smocking Barrels') yet far superior, with more twists and turns to keep you guessing, more hilarious comments to keep you laughing, and more intriguing story lines to keep you watching, again and again. Also, you get your fist glimpse of the next James Bond in Daniel Craig, who should do a fantastic job. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys a thinking movie, comparable to 'Pulp Fiction' and maybe better! I love it!",Layer Cake
285,dhrubapatra,One of the better movies in the gangster genre,9,31 March 2017,"Layer cake is one of the old school gangster movies of which everybody is fond of.Daniel Craig's brilliant acting and Mike Gambon's steely tone surely strikes a nerve amongst the audience.Its a a type of movie you have to re-watch to understand it better.I myself had watch last 30 minutes twice again to get what really was happening.Lastly the teaser left at the very last of the film before Daniel Craig was shot ""My name?If you knew that you would be as clever as me."" Owing to fan theory surely it must be an anagram of the very movie name...""Layer Cake""which gives XXXX's name as Carey Lake or Lake Carey.But remember when all fan theories of the TV series Sherlock failed as to how Moriarty faked his death and then we came to know he is truly dead in season 4...maybe in this case too we are all wrongBut we all come to know about this when the layer cake sequel is released if ever.",Layer Cake
286,Solenluver,My Favorite Movie,10,9 March 2006,"I loved this movie. The sly, wry, and super-cool style of this movie is why I bought it, and watch it almost every week! (As a mater of fact, I just did!) Suspense, mystery, and plot twists that leave you coming back for more. Action, comedy, it's all here. Daniel Craig is a great actor, and one of my favorites after this performance. (He is the new Bond now as well.) From start to end, the Layer cake outperforms and is very witty. I must say that a lot of people would probably not see the twists coming. I am very happy it didn't have a 'love story' in the movie. Way too many movies have the element of some man saving the world, and getting the girl at the end... boring and predictable. Not with the Layer Cake! It's all action, intrigue and an overall a great movie. Buy the Layer Cake DVD Today! It'll be worth it! ;-)",Layer Cake
287,pconn-48231,Blown Away,10,9 March 2019,"As someone who likes to think they've seen a lot of movies, after I watched this I was almost embarrassed I hadn't come across it before. This film was lights out and immediately shot up my list of all-time favs. Sex, Drugs, Violence. Well-woven storylines, perfect soundtrack, and an all-star cast. Also, I'm no expert, but you could tell some of the filmmaking was first-class. Can't recommend this movie enough. 11/10",Layer Cake
288,bronwenp,Very disappointing,2,22 December 2005,"I was wholeheartedly disappointed with this film. It failed miserably in any attempt to be witty, and in the end was nothing but a poor imitation of the successful hits it was blatantly trying to emulate. Sienna Miller's role was fleeting and the character was not developed enough for it to have any point in the movie, the bad guys were not hardly tough or scary enough and the lead role (Daniel Craig) was that of a man out of his depth and without substance. I felt completely distanced from all of the characters, didn't care for any of them and didn't laugh once (the occasional smile was all I could muster). The final straw for me was the horrendous ""Brideshead Revisited"" suit worn by Craig.",Layer Cake
289,ron-black2,"""Fucking Excellent"" to quote the film",10,1 September 2006,"When i first saw this advertised, i was dubious. They had a lead who'd never done lead before, a director who'd never directed and the film poster was a yellow ranger rover with an iron on it, but despite my sscepticism i went to see the film anyway. I am now very glad i did. It was the greatest film experience of my life, Layer Cake is stylish, clever, funny and all round entertaining Crime Thriller which is a very hard genre to pull of properly, but Matthew Vaughn pulled it of to perfection, with his charismatic lead Daniel Craig, who plays the nameless drug dealer, which, despite his profession, you can't help but like. Throughout the film the entire cast is both humorous and convincing. You could believe that these were real people. The score is a work of art, it brilliantly sets the tone of each scene and matches Matthew Vaughn's stylised direction perfectly. I recommend to all that you watch this film.",Layer Cake
290,french707,Great film - - - - up until the *&@!!! ending! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!,2,30 January 2006,"I reeeaaallly don't know why a director would DESTROY his own movie with an intentionally INCOMPREHENSIBLE ending. Maybe he's in serious need of therapy, or just hates the audience... who knows?? This movie starts out by being a terrific modern British gangster film - midway through, you will think, ""Oh'm'god, this may be one of those rare instant classics..."" THEN --- you get to this really BOTCHED, totally incomprehensible last 10 minutes of the movie, and you'll think: ""What-The-Hell-Is-Going-On??!!!"" What happened?!!! NOOOooo!!!!You will want to kick in your DVD player. Yes, it's that bad. As the movie gets to the end, the director plays with TIME, has probably deleted vitally important exposition dialog or scenes... starts inverting his sequences (editing them out of chronological order, so you don't know where you are, sequence-wise, playing with Time, and you literally - and I mean Literally - don't know what just happened. I saw this with 9 people, and we all love crime dramas, and police procedurals, and we all work in the entertainment business. Two of the people here were writers - one's a scriptwriter on a major network show, the other writes entertainment pieces for national magazines and the Hollywood trades. NONE OF US COULD UNDERSTAND THE CLIMAX/RESOLUTION. It's like the director & editor went on a drug binge and decided to mess up their own movie just for the fun of it. We saw this on DVD, and even replayed the last 10 minutes a second time, and we're going like - Oops! - what's Happening? Yes, it's that BAD. If you rent this movie, you'll love it until the last ten minutes, and then you will go ballistic, screaaming mad. I guarantee you will say: ""What the hell??!"" The worse part is - this was really an excellent, beautifully made movie with superb ensemble acting, highly stylish direction and distinctive photography. But it's the story, guys, always we come back to the story...Now, I have one question: why would a director want to screw up his own movie and ruin it for an audience? I'm warning you - if you rent this picture, you're going to get very angry at the ending, believe me. That is, if you've haven't been doing drugs or alcohol from a little bit earlier in the day...",Layer Cake
