0,MartinHafer,A film about teens which really is NOT about teens!,5,11 July 2015,"""The DUFF"" is a mildly enjoyable film that doesn't quite hit the mark. I think it could have scored a bullseye but the movie had two big things working against it. First, while this is supposed to be high school, the actors are mostly adults--too old for high school. They also at times talk NOTHING like kids but like super-savvy adults. So, when the leading lady makes a marvelous speech near the end, when you think about it, NO teen is that smart, that self-aware and that intelligent!! Second, the film is definitely NOT something I'd encourage teens to see. Sure, teens think about sex and curse-- I am not naive. But seeing so much talk about sex acts and nasty language made me feel a bit squeamish when I thought about kids seeing the film. I am not a prude, mind you--just aware that the film's primary audience shouldn't be as sexually active as the film would seem to want them to be. Overall, a decent film that is best appreciated by an older audience but a film that also COULD have been for all audiences without all the sexual references. Oh, and if you do watch, understand that the film is a lot like ""Pygmalion"" and the love story is amazingly easy to predict.",The DUFF
1,bkoganbing,High school Pygmalion,5,29 April 2015,Belle Thorne fresh from the Disney teen comedy Shake It Up plays the bad girl in high school in The DUFF. As the prettiest most popular girl in the school she has been given the approval by the consensus of all to determine the roles and pecking order of her high school. Poor Mae Whitman is designated a DUFF which is Designated Ugly Fat Friend. Whitman is sloppy but she is by no means ugly which is the main weakness of The DUFF. But naturally it isn't a role she relishes so being smart she gets jock Robbie Amell who is going out with Thorne to give her some pointers on popularity. The goal is to land sensitive musician Nick Eversman because she's crushing out on him big time.This reworking of Pygmalion set in a contemporary American high school offers little in teen comedy we haven't seen before other than some fresh new faces. I guess all we really learn is if you're a designated DUFF make sure to change schools.,The DUFF
2,SnoopyStyle,conventional teen comedy with likable characters,6,2 January 2016,"It's high school senior year for Bianca (Mae Whitman), and her best friends hot sweet Jess (Skyler Samuels) and hot Latina Casey (Bianca A. Santos). Wesley (Robbie Amell) is her childhood friend, neighbor and man-whore jock. At a party, he tells her that she's Jess and Casey's DUFF (Designated Ugly Fat Friend). This throws her into a tailspin. Madison (Bella Thorne) is the class mean girl. Bianca has a crush on Toby but she has trouble talking to him.This conventional teen comedy has a couple of things going for it. Whitman is adorable and believable at being overlooked. Amell plays the jock without being mean-spirited. The 'kids' are mostly in their 20s. With likable Whitman and Amell, the movie is able to maneuver the standard plot without crashing. That's not to say there aren't a couple of awkward moments. Bianca's fantasy scenes do get repetitive and one of them last too long. It's a gimmick that loses its effectiveness. The movie doesn't work all the time but it works enough. It's not quite 'Mean Girls'. The writing isn't as sharp. It probably needs a great comedic writer to add more of the better material.",The DUFF
3,nogodnomasters,TO THE POINT OF NEEDING HELMETS,8,12 June 2019,"Bianca (Mae Whitman), Casey (Bianca A. Santos) and Jess (Skyler Samuels) are three BFFs. Bianca is the smart one and at 14 minutes into the film she realizes she is a ""DUFF"" (Designated Ugly Fat Friend) which is certainly better than being a BUFF (Big Ugly Fat F@#$) although she doesn't like the role even though she is neither fat or ugly.This changes Bianca's perspective on life, school, social standings, and her best friends. Bianca wants to go out with Toby Tucker (Nick Eversman) a boy who plays a guitar and has bangs. She gets the help of her childhood friend Wesley Rush (Robbie Amell), the high school jock who dates the hottest girl in the school (Bella Thorne) . Wesley needs help with chemistry which gives us the predictable formula results including the climax speech.The film is predictable from the title. It is teen oriented. DUFFs should love it.Guide: No real sex or nudity. Mom spouts an F-bomb near the end.",The DUFF
4,kosmasp,Mean people,7,24 February 2016,"A teenage movie that obviously will play out one way or another depending on whether you like those or not. It's pretty witty and it has some genuine jokes in it (not to mention some very funny supporting cast to boot with). The story itself is as in many cases, very predictable. You know who the real ""target"" of affection is going to be.But the movie is able to win one over, if you buy into the whole light heartiness of the movie. The movie as some before it is very self aware and there are many in jokes in this. It's also refreshing to see the main girl being a horror movie fan. It's also interesting to see how much PG-13 movies have evolved over the years and how much more is allowed to be said in them. All in all, a lot of fun",The DUFF
5,studioAT,Trying and failing to be a John Hughes film,2,20 June 2017,"Every modern teen film wants to be a John Hughes film. Everyone making a modern teen film aspires for it to become as beloved as a John Hughes film. Not every film though can be a John Hughes, and ends up looking like a bargain basement copy. This is one such film.There are good performances being given, and the script isn't half bad, but even two years later this film comes across as being dated (something Hughes's films don't 30 years later) and I doubt it will be remembered half as highly as the film makers seem to hope it will be in the DVD extras.It's a decent attempt, but not one of the better Hughes inspired teen films doing the rounds.",The DUFF
6,zardoz-13,Easy B,8,24 February 2015,"The captivating ""Pygmalion"" comedy ""The DUFF"" revitalizes the standard-issue, romantic, high school, makeover movie. No, I haven't read Kentucky-native Kody Keplinger's 2010 novel that she wrote while she attended high school. Nevertheless, freshman director Ari Sandel and ""Bandslam"" scenarist Josh A. Cagan appear to have infused their adaptation of Keplinger's yarn with the wit, charm, and sophistication reminiscent of classics such as John Hughes' ""The Breakfast Club"" (1985) and Amy Heckerling's ""Clueless"" (1995). Most makeover comedies are so lame they are mediocre. Prime examples include 1987's ""Can't Buy Me Love"" and 1999's ""She's All That."" Moreover, the superlative makeover movie parody ""Not Another Teen Movie"" (2001) subjected the genre to devastating ridicule. Although ""The DUFF"" appropriates most of the usual conventions and clichés, the characters emerge as more interesting, the predicaments more stimulating, and the humor more imaginative. While our sympathetic but iconoclastic senior class heroine is negotiating the complex social order maze, ""The DUFF"" compounds her problems, pitting her against cyber-bullies who exploit the social media technology to insult, humiliate, and destroy her because she represents a threat. No, this frivolous, PG-13 rated, frolic doesn't plumb the appalling depths of ""Disconnect"" (2012) where callous cyber bullies drove a sensitive teen to commit suicide. Comparatively, our heroine packs considerably more pluck than the unfortunate ""Disconnect"" protagonist, and she survives everything with which her ruthless adversaries assault her.Like most teen movies in a high school setting, this clever comedy categorizes its characters by archetypes. ""The DUFF"" assembles the traditional gallery of crude egotistical jocks, bitchy babe princesses, and oblivious adults--whether they are administrators, instructors, or parents. Sandel and Cagan orchestrate the action around the most prominent high school happening: prom. Of course, graduation constitutes the other landmark event, but prom overshadows graduation. Primarily, prom generates far greater opportunities for dramatic conflict than congregations in caps and gowns. As in most high school sagas, teenagers are searching desperately for their place in the social pecking order. While their parents and peers are manipulating them like marionettes from behind the scenes, these struggling teens have to muster the nerve to assert themselves as individuals and break free of those fetters. All makeover movies, whether good or bad, are ranked by how challenging the obstacle course is, and if the teens can triumph. Naturally, our resourceful heroine achieves her goal, but she has to sidestep the slings and arrows of her treacherous enemies along the way.The acronym DUFF that doubles as the title for Sandel's first film stands for 'designated ugly fat friend.' If for no other reason, ""The DUFF"" has carved a niche out for itself in teen makeover movie history because it originated this term. Bianca Piper (Mae Whitman of ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"") doesn't live to loiter in the limelight. An honor roll scholar, she writes for the campus newspaper, dresses as if she were homeless, and watches cult horror chillers like Lucio Fulci's ""Zombie."" Bianca's two best friends are aspiring fashion designer Jess (Skyler Samuels of ""Furry Vengeance"") and gorgeous but geeky Internet nerd Casey (Bianca A. Santos of ""Ouija""), who can do anything with a computer. Not surprisingly, these two dolls are drop-dead gorgeous, while our ugly duckling heroine dresses beneath their status. Bianca's life-long, next door neighbor is football team captain Wesley (Robbie Amell of TV's ""The Tomorrow People"") who dreams about dating Jess. He approaches Bianca one day to recruit her as his go-between. At this point in her high school career, Bianca has never heard the term DUFF. Moreover, she cringes with surprise and horror at being pigeonholed into such an unflattering category. Wesley explains that DUFFs exist everywhere. At lunch, he points out examples of both guys and girls at lunch taking refuge from the violence.No sooner has Bianca learned about her deplorable status than she resolves not only to alter her lifestyle but also eliminate her friends. Actually, neither Jess nor Casey has ever taken advantage of Bianca as a DUFF. Nevertheless, our hot-headed heroine doesn't see things objectively enough at the moment. Meantime, resident 'mean girl' drama queen Madison (Bella Thorne of ""Blended""), who has had an on-again, off-again relationship with Wesley, has decided to renew their romance. Things come to a boil when Wesley's poor chemistry grades jeopardize his status as captain of the high school football team. Simultaneously, Bianca marvels at the ease with which Wesley navigates the social order. Bianca cuts a deal with Wesley. She will tutor Wesley in chemistry, if he will show her how to attract the attention of her dream guy. Naturally, green-eyed Madison has kept an eye on Wesley and Bianca from afar, and she plots Bianca's demise if she doesn't leave her Wesley alone. Madison's best friend shoots a reality video journal of Madison's life, and Madison assigns her to maintain stealth surveillance on Wesley and Bianca. Ironically, Bianca wasn't trying to seduce Wesley. Instead, Bianca has had a crush on a laid-back, acoustical guitarist, Toby (Nick Eversman of ""Wild""), but she cannot utter more than two words when they encounter each other on campus.Indeed, ""The DUFF"" is predictable, particularly if you've seen as many teen makeover movies as I have, but top-notch casting, charismatic characters, and suspenseful situations elevate this comedy above the standard stuff. Mae Whitman reminded me of the ultimate 1990's DUFF character: Janeane Garofalo, who co-starred with Uma Thurman in ""The Truth About Cats and Dogs."" Whitman's fascination with horror movies is also reminiscent of Ellen Page from ""Juno."" Bianca provides a running, voice-over narration, enlivened with commentary similar to Emma Stone's comments in ""Easy A."" Happily, Whitman and co-star Robbie Amell generate showers of sparks, and they look like they enjoyed sharing their scenes as teacher and student. The funniest scene depicts Bianca trying on apparel and making out with a mannequin that resembles her dream date Toby. Altogether, ""The DUFF qualifies as an easy-B.",The DUFF
7,Calicodreamin,Sarcastic and adorable,7,3 October 2021,"A sarcastic teen rom com that ticks all the boxes. The leads have great chemistry and the characters had depth. Although the plot was wildly predictable, you want it all to happen. Kind of lovely and adorable.",The DUFF
8,oscaralbert,I used to see Hilary Duff in movies such as . . .,8,23 February 2015,". . . CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN and MATERIAL GIRLS, but none of these flicks explained why this actress chose to go by that name. After seeing THE D.U.F.F., Hilary's career suddenly all makes sense. She epitomized Duffness before anyone tried to make it ""cool."" THE D.U.F.F. certainly is carefully crafted to make viewers ask themselves, ""What other Hollywood stars are going about their business as acronyms-waiting-to-happen? Has Hilary S. given tips to Bella Thorne (who plays the B*Tchy ""Madison Morgan"" in THE D.U.F.F.) about how Some Women Are Not Kissable (S.W.A.N.K.)? Which Wayans relative does Kevin H. think most deserves notoriety for possessing Hardly Any Real Talent (H.A.R.T.)? On the morbid side, did Paul Walker have a subconscious tendency to take after James D. as a Dead End Auto Nut (D.E.A.N.)? As you can see, THE D.U.F.F. has started a new form of word play that is as likely to sweep the country as Six Degrees of Kevin Bad Actors Can Only Network (B.A.C.O.N.) did in the previous century.",The DUFF
9,neil-476,Unexceptional but likable,7,17 April 2015,"Bianca discovers that she has been identified at school as the DUFF (Designated Ugly Female Friend), the unattractive third member in a group of three friends whose presence amplifies the attractiveness of the other two. She recruits the help of slightly dim but extremely handsome childhood friend and next door neighbour Wesley in overcoming DUFFness in time for the prom.So, no surprises here, then, in an utterly routine high school romcom complete with nerdy protagonist, bitchy would-be prom queen, lover boy who can't recognise a good thing when it's right in front of him, and ugly duckling into swan revelation at the prom.But it's good hearted, smileworthy if not laugh-out-loud, features some terrific stuff from Ken Jeong, and is peopled by likable characters: it is a likable film. If you are a high school romcom fan you should enjoy it: you'll have seen better, but you'll have seen worse, too.",The DUFF
10,ferguson-6,Friend or Foe?,5,18 February 2015,"Greetings again from the darkness. I was never a teenage girl, and for that, I am quite thankful. By comparison, being a teenage guy was a breeze. No filmmaker was better than the great John Hughes at capturing the challenges of high school  especially for girls. The mysteries of adolescent social hierarchy has long been a favorite movie target, and director Ari Sandel (Oscar winner for his short film West Bank Story) and screenwriter Josh Cagan loosely base their film on the novel from Kody Keplinger.Mae Whitman (from TV's ""Parenthood"") stars as Bianca, a very smart student who enjoys hanging with her two best friends Casey (Bianca Santos, Ouija) and Jess (Skyler Samuels). That all changes one evening at a party when Bianca's neighbor, and the school's alpha-jock Wesley (Robbie Amell, Firestorm in TV's ""The Flash""), informs her that she is the titular ""DUFF""  Designated Ugly Fat Friend. The term itself is quite offensive, but the movie does its best to soften the blow by explaining that it doesn't necessarily mean ugly or fat – a confusing turn, but fortunate since Ms. Whitman is neither.As you might imagine, the familiar terrain of teen angst movies is covered and any hope of real insight is dashed pretty early on. However, it does spend a significant amount of time driving home the point that social media plays a dominant role in every aspect of teen life these days, including cyber-bullying. It's no wonder that insecurities abound  one never knows when their trip to the mall or make-out session with a mannequin will become a viral video.There are familiar aspects of such classics as Pretty in Pink, She's All That, and Mean Girls. Robbie Amell even looks very much like Michael Schoeffling from Sixteen Candles. However, the film features two of my movie pet peeves. First, Mae Whitman and Robbie Amell are both in their mid-20's – entirely too old to be playing high school students. Secondly, Mr Amell plays a jock but clearly cannot throw a football like one – and he does it three cringe-inducing times.Mae Whitman has excellent screen presence and comes across as a blend of Janeane Garofalo, Ellen Page, and Aubrey Plaza. That's pretty high praise, but she elevates a script that needs it, and holds her own with screen vets like Allison Janney (as her distracted mom) and Ken Jeong (as her slightly loopy journalism teacher).The film is a commentary on today's high school life, but the predictability and obvious gags prevent it from ever going too deep or appealing to any audience other than ""tweeners"". Still, any film that smacks down the nasty people (here played by Bella Thorne) and advises to be true to one's self, can't be all bad.",The DUFF
11,anaconda-40658,The Bella.,6,11 May 2015,"The Duff (2015): Dir: Ari Sandel / Cast: Mae Whitman, Robbie Amell, Bella Thorne, Skyler Samuels, Bianca A. Santos: Teen comedy that addresses a new label called Designated Ugly Fat Friend. This is given to females whose presence around more attractive females make her more approachable thus elevating her stats. Mae Whitman plays Bianca Piper whose two friends are stunning and she is informed by her athletic next door neighbour guy pal that she is, in fact, a duff. She retaliates and decides to translate towards a superior image. Robbie Amell plays Wesley Rush who is failing chemistry thus threatening a potential scholarship when he could be pulled from sports. He helps her improve her image while she assists him with his chemistry grade. Bella Thorne plays Madison, Wes's ex-girlfriend who is totally into herself and despises Bianca's sudden rise in popularity and her insecurity when Wes appears to take interest. While this premise is promising, it ultimately falls into formula retreads that lead to the conclusion that viewers will long arrive at before it happens. Mean Girls and Easy A are obvious inspirations, and in that manner, the film works. Whitman carries the film trying to find acceptance while employing a witty outsider's take on life. Robbie Amell is also good as her neighbour. Thorne as Madison contains all the personality of an underwear ad, and Bianca's friends, played by Skyler Samuels and Bianca A. Santos are briefly introduced and never fully explored as characters. While it could have been better, it does highlight a theme regarding labels but ultimately how we accept oneself despite others. Score: 6 / 10",The DUFF
12,StevePulaski,"I fear for the unexpected, inverse effects",4,22 February 2015,"The glaring issue with ""The DUFF,"" which is an acronym for ""Designated Ugly Fat Friend,"" a phrase I've never heard employed and warrants few other Google searches besides those relative to the film, but I digress, is that its leading female character is neither. If Mae Whitman can be called a ""DUFF"" with complete seriousness, it sends a brazenly wrong message to the teenage girls who will likely go see this film. If that was the only issue with ""The DUFF,"" that would be one thing, but the fact that shortly after Whitman's character is called such a name, the person explaining the term to her says how you really don't have to be fat or ugly to be a group of people's ""DUFF."" If the term isn't even going to be employed with any kind of conviction or relevance in a film centered around such a moronic label, my questions are - why use the term and why make this movie? The film concerns Bianca (Mae Whitman), a smart, eccentric teenage girl, who enjoys her individuality and her love for cult horror movies. She spends most of her time with Jess (Skyler Samuels) and Casey (Bianca A. Santos), two popular girls who find themselves at the center of everyone's attention whenever they walk through the hallways. Bianca's crush is a musician named Toby (Nick Eversman), and her other vague friend is Wes (Robbie Amell), the star of the school's football team, who is also her next-door neighbor. One day, Bianca attends a party hosted by the queen bitch of the school Madison (Bella Thorne), who is the typical high school queen bitch that does indeed exist but rarely to the extent of the cartoonish one Thorne portrays. It is at that party that Wes informs Bianca that she is the ""DUFF"" of her group of friends, or, as stated, the ""Designated Ugly Fat Friend"" - someone the group keeps around to elevate the attractiveness of them. Bianca is appalled to realize this, and compromises with Wes in a way that will help her popularity and image be drastically changed around the school in exchange for use of her chemistry notes so Wes can pass chemistry and play on the football team once again.Whenever I see a film like ""The DUFF,"" one so hellbent on profiling and worsening the clichés of high school by either dramatizing them to the point where they are almost unrecognizable in their stupidity and so determined to try and stay ""hip"" and ahead of its culture, I'm reminded of writer/director Larry Clark and his films about teenagers. Granted, his films on teenagers are raw, provocative, and vulgar, but they exert a kind of honesty and, unfortunately, are widely unseen by the public. When speaking on his films, Clark states how he wants honesty to triumph convention and easily-digestible drivel we've grown to accept. ""Let everyone else have the b*******,"" he states, while he praises those who crave honesty in their depictions of teenagers and their culture.Obviously, ""The DUFF"" isn't trying to be provocative, although it warrants some comparison to the reality of teenagers versus how this particular film sees teenagers. Even comparing ""The DUFF"" to contemporary films of the genre, like ""Easy A"" and ""Mean Girls,"" it simply doesn't work because it mistakes hipness for insight. Including pervasive hashtags that say such cringe-worthy things like ""#MyFutureBabyDaddy"" and ""#Amazeballs"" only work to obscure any real emotionally honest that could be explored in such a generation. Even ""Easy A,"" a film I heavily praised, not only managed to parallel a popular piece of literature, but satirized the entire genre and still managed to remain relevant and thoroughly entertaining. ""The DUFF"" is too half-baked and obsessed with juvenile convention to even consider it such a possibility.Give Whitman credit, as not only filling the shoes of the ""fat"" and ""ugly"" role she was never supposed to play is something that she warms up to quite quickly, but for bearing the energy and heart needed to make such a performance and character likable. Also give Thorne a great deal of credit for being a contemptible figure to Whitman's good-natured, often high-spirited one, despite functioning almost entirely off of over-embellished clichés and an eye-rolling dramatization.""The DUFF"" isn't a terrible film, but its purpose and existence merit a barrage of questions. For starters, why create a senseless slang word that doesn't even apply to the character you're profiling in the film, and secondly, why erect such a project on lame, overdrawn clichés when there's plenty of honest and real exploration to be done for teenagers? The cast is capable and high-spirited, doing a wonderful job at disguising the menial and overall unremarkable material, but the impact of this film on many teenage girls, despite the entirely sentimental and frothy ending, I fear, may have the opposite effect of what I hope is intended on part of director Ari Sandel and writer Josh A. Cagan.",The DUFF
13,Hellmant,It's hard not to like a movie like this!,7,18 June 2015,"'THE DUFF': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)  A teen comedy flick about an awkward high school senior, that learns  she's been labeled 'The DUFF' (Designated Ugly Fat Friend) of her  friend group. It stars Mae Whitman, Robbie Amell and Bella Thorne  (Thorne being the only actual teen of the trio; the other two are 27,  while Thorne is 17). The film was directed by Ari Sandel and written by  Josh A. Cagan; it's based on the book, of the same name, by Kody  Keplinger. It's an OK teen movie; nothing too memorable, but not bad  either.  Bianca (Whitman) is a happy senior, and good at school, but she's also  pretty strange; she's seen as unattractive, and annoying, by many  classmates. She's best friends with two of the most popular, and  desired, girls at her school; Jess (Skyler Samuels) and Casey (Bianca  Santos). She doesn't realize it, but she's been labeled their 'DUFF';  by the rest of the school. Her childhood friend and neighbor, Wes Rush  (Amell), informs her of this, and it turns her whole world upside down.  She then breaks up with Jess and Casey, and asks Wes, who's also a  popular football star, to teach her how to act cool; mostly to attract  a boy she's crushing on (Nick Eversman). Wes's ex-girlfriend, Madison  Morgan (Thorne), who's also the most popular girl at school, doesn't  like the idea of the two spending time together; and she'll do anything  to ruin Bianca's image (even more) to stop it.   The movie is kind of clever, witty and insightful (but not overly so).  It's well acted (for the most part); Whitman and Amell are especially  likable, as the leads. It also teaches teens, and everyone, a valuable  lesson about being yourself; and not worrying what others think of you.  It's hard not to like a movie like this, or talk poorly of it too much  (or even at all). It's definitely not a classic teen movie, or even a  really good one, but it's decent.",The DUFF
14,Buddy-51,A lack of originality does this one in,4,13 September 2015,"Fresh off five seasons of ""Parenthood,"" Mae Whitman is the almost saving grace of ""The DUFF,"" a teen romance, based on the novel by Kody Keplinger, whose attempts at pointed social commentary are undercut by a cut-and-paste screenplay by Josh A. Cagan and indifferent direction by Ari Sandel.DUFF - short for Designated Ugly Fat Friend - is a derogatory term applied to the least attractive person in a group whose sole purpose is to make the others look even more attractive by comparison and to provide interested boys and girls easier access to the knockouts. When she is informed that she is the DUFF for her two super hot girlfriends, Bianca decides to spruce herself up in an effort to attract the sensitive songwriter on whom she has a crush. It doesn't take long before this Cinderella story has morphed into ""Pygmalion,"" as Bianca turns to her lifelong best friend, Wesley (""The Tomorrow People""'s Robbie Arnell), the school's hunky ""man whore"" of a quarterback, for lessons on how to make the transformation from DUFF to hottie, from wallflower to full-on make-out artist. But can this Professor Henry Higgins keep his hands, let alone his lips, off this Eliza Doolittle? If you even have to ask that question, then this may actually be your first encounter with a romantic comedy.Unfortunately, the movie fights against Whitman's naturalism and charm almost every step of the way, going so far as to include some really cheesy fantasy sequences as a means of filling up the time. It even has a trying-on-dresses montage sequence ripped straight out of every mainstream romantic comedy that's been green-lit since ""Pretty Woman.""The one thing the movie does get right is showing how the ubiquitous nature of social media has intensified, by many forces of magnitude, the mean-spiritedness, shallowness and appearance-centric nature of teen culture, with cyber-bullying as one of its uglier and more damaging manifestations.The movie does have a salutary moral that it matters less what others think about us than what we think about ourselves, and I suppose that's a truth every generation must discover for itself. It's just too bad the movies on that subject all have to look and feel so much like one another - regardless of the era in which they're set.",The DUFF
15,Robert_duder,A fun little late-teen comedy that works,8,9 April 2015,"I'm not ashamed to admit that I sort of like the late-teen genre. Yes it is a genre. Mean Girls, Easy A, Bring It On, Pitch Perfect...movies like that. They are sort of what John Hughes' films morphed into in the new Millennium. But I feel like it has been awhile since we had one like this. It definitely hits all the right notes and follows the genre specific recipe to make it entertaining. Its a little bit dirty and silly with over the top stereotypical high school clique roles. It isn't quite as fun as classics like Mean Girls or Ten Things I Hate About You and I can't see it being as memorable either but it definitely works and aims itself appropriately at the demographic. If there is a moral here, its a pretty shallow moral but that's not the point. Its a comedy at heart with a little romance and friendship. Perhaps the only thing that feels a little ridiculous is the film captures the spirit of Beverly Hills 90210 by casting nearly thirty year old high school students. They play their roles well and they looked proper age to me but I'm not a High Schooler. The cast is an interesting mix of potential up and comers regardless.Mae Whitman gets her first real starring role in a film. She was also good in the TV Series Parenthood but she actually proved she could do this. She wasn't quite as charismatic as an A-Lister (Emma Stone, Anne Hathaway even Lindsay Lohan in her prime) but she is down to earth and someone you can relate to and that might be more important for this particular movie. Bella Thorne who is a real up and comer as far as I'm concerned plays the hideously mean Madison. Thorne is a natural at sarcastic comedy, she was awesome in Blended, and she plays this part perfectly and is a great nemesis for Whitman. Robbie Amell plays Whitman's boy next door who is going to help turn her into a swan ala She's All That. Amell and Whitman have great chemistry, you really feel like they are childhood friends and they are the backbone of the movie. Bianca A. Santos and Skyler Samuels are okay as Whitman's best friends. They don't really get a lot of scenes and certainly not much in the character department but they are good.Ari Sandel is fairly new to the directing game but he definitely shows some talent in this genre. He has enough experience in comedy but he also is really making an effort to focus on the story here and I have to respect that because comedy doesn't make the film watchable, the story does. It isn't your typical mainstream big budget teen flick. It feels a little more indie and stylish and definitely worth checking out. It doesn't necessarily stand out in the genre but I would absolutely watch it again and it showcases a lot of new talent and a fun film. 7.5/10",The DUFF
16,A_Different_Drummer,Bring back Freddie Prinze Jr - please!,5,13 March 2015,"This is not a movie.This is a science experiment.The object is to establish once and for all whether films like Heathers, Easy A, and Mean Girls (among others) were actually quality productions -- or whether there is just something so magically interesting about High School romcoms that ANYBODY with a camera and a script they recently crayoned on the back of a menu can make a successful film...? Well, the results are in.Turns out you actually need a good story, a good script, a good director and charismatic actors to pull off a decent film in this genre.Which pretty much eliminates this entry from the competition as it seems to have none of the above.(Although Whitman and Amell both show potential, and one suspects with better material they COULD shine) I have reviewed a lot of films but I cannot easily recall one where every opportunity for entertainment was either sabotaged or missed completely.The film actually panders to its audience, throwing around internet tradenames as if, by their sheer volume, they can elevate the viewing experience.At the 30 minute mark, the audience is asked to believe that two teens engaged in picking outfits in local department store could possibly ""miss"" the fact that they are being video'd by a third teen half-hidden behind a rack of dresses....? In Film School they explain that these are the sorts of ""subliminal"" turnoffs which make the viewer uncomfortable on a subconscious level, even if the conscious mind misses it.Have no fear -- in this film the script repeats the same trope at the 1:00 mark where the same third party secretly videos the same couple, only this time in the woods.Watta script! Does the term ""creatively bankrupt"" strike a chord? The ending tries, and that is the most I can say about it.If anything it tries too hard, and in other reviews I have talked about the filmic dangers of putting too much ""message"" in your movie.However in the case of this film, by the time you get to the end -- assuming you can -- the film-makers have made so many other mistakes that ""too much message"" is the least of their worries.",The DUFF

I am a 36 year old man and because of that I wasn't really looking forward to watching this. I will admit that I liked Mean Girls but this genre isn't usually my favorite. I don't know if that expectation had an effect on how I felt about the movie but I have to say that I actually really liked this. I laughed a lot through out and even though it was a little generic it was still enjoyable and just fresh enough to keep it interesting. It's a pretty harsh PG-13 so be warned before you just let your kids watch this but then again it's probable nothing they haven't heard before. Overall, not quite as good as Mean Girls but I liked this much more than I expected to. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I recommend this movie. I surprisingly give this a B+.",The DUFF

19,nairtejas,Abridged Bible For The YOLO. ♦ 40%,4,14 June 2015,"There are films which are not suitable for all age groups and The DUFF is one perfect example.The base is set about a clumsy teen (Whitman) who thinks she is lucky to have two hotties (Santos & Samuels) as her friends in college. When she comes to know, from a good friend (Amell), that she is, in fact, designated an ugly and fat friend (abbrev. DUFF) of the group, she begins introspecting and changing her ways.You will detect how the story is outlined and if you are smart, chances are that you will see where and how the story is going to that cliché reservoir where all such films (read teen comedies) go. The preachy topic of being yourself when it comes to bullies at college, especially at this age of viral videos, is expressive, mostly because it is said with a tinge of humor.Although, one will understand that the plot keeps its distance from the reality, where in the school the teachers are the weirder ones. The soundtrack is complementing and so is the colorful setup. All said and done, the highly predictive climax just makes the whole film look like it dug its own grave with its own teeth.BOTTOM LINE: The DUFF is an effortless affair with doses of good comedy that will crack you up, even if you are not between 12 and 18 years of age, the group to whom it is actually intended.VERDICT: Below Average.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

After realising her issue, she fights back to regain what she was missing. This type of concept is extremely common, but initiating a fresh idea on where the narration can develop the plots and finishes off high note is the vital for a movie's success. This film had one of that and that is called the DUFF. You can find out what that stands for in its official posters.The movie was above the average. The characters were great, but not the unique ones. Everything was enjoyable, I mean it was not a usual annoying teen movie. Well directed because he got a good screenplay that extracted from the book of the same name. The cast was good, nice performances and so it is official that Bella Thorne classified for those mean girl roles.Anyway the main character Bianca was so good. Whitman was too old for the role, but outclassed it. Carefully handled to get under the PG13, and it succeeds. So kids with the matured minds are pretty much allowed to watch it and I don't see any serious offensive to keep them away other than facts the film talks about.

22,sol-,Designated by Design,6,13 November 2016,"Described as ""the 'Mean Girls' of this generation"" on the Blu-ray back cover, 'The DUFF' is not nearly as fresh and quick-witted as Tiny Fey's iconic high school comedy, but it is fairly decent for what it is. The plot has a teenage social misfit discovering that everyone thinks of her as a ""designated ugly fat friend"" to her two more traditionally attractive best friends, which prompts her to try to climb up the social ladder at school. The film gets off to a very good start, full of witty narration by lead actress Mae Whitman whose spunky, highly individualistic personality lights up the first few scenes. The less said about the rest of the young actors, the better though, with Bella Thorne in particular paling against Rachel McAdams who played a very similar character in 'Mean Girls', though to be fair, her role in the narrative is quite limited. Curiously enough, the same can be said for those in the adult roles too. Ken Jeong had one of the most fun oddball roles in the TV show 'Community', but here he has little to do other than occasionally banter with Whitman as her favourite teacher. Allison Janney likewise has some funny moments as Whitman's free spirited mother, but her references to 'This is Spinal Tap' and unexpected swearing bits are few and far between. Whatever the case, the film almost works as 'My Fair Lady' variant with Whitman making a deal with her next door neighbour to help her transform, however, the romantic tension to come between the pair is telegraphed from so early on that it becomes a distraction to Whitman's quest to fit in. The film is at least energetic and zany enough (with a ton of social media plugs) that there is never a boring moment to be had. The end credits are especially well done.",The DUFF

The story line is the same old story about girl wanting to change and boy being so desperate for increasing his grades, that agrees to transform her. However in Duff there is a twist. Bianca, although wiling to change, she learns to appreciate herself the way she is. That was something original in the plot, but the rest was just the well known high school drama (with technology being used very cleverly here). The performances were really good, especially the girl who played Bianca was exceptional, really owning the role and being just enough funny and just enough melodramatic as it was needed.

24,leonblackwood,Predictable and corny! 3/10,3,7 September 2015,"Review: I wasn't that impressed with this film because it seemed like many other teenage high school movies that we have seen many times before. The jokes weren't that funny and the predictable storyline wasn't that great. Its about a teenage girl, Bianca (Mae Whitman) who hangs around with two beautiful girls in college and soon realises that she is being ignored by everyone in her school. She then gets told by her friend, Wesley (Robbie Amell) that she is the DUFF in her group, which stands for the Designated Ugly Fat Friend, so she asks him for tips to become noticed and datable. He agrees to change her looks and persona on the bases that she helps him with his grades, which he is going to fail because he concentrates on beautiful girls and sports. She then ditches her friends and goes to the store with Wesley to buy a whole new wardrobe but while she is in the store posing in front of the mirror, one of her college enemies is filming her making a fool out of herself. When she goes back to college she sees that the footage of her in the store has gone viral so she becomes the joke of the school, which doesn't go down well with the principle who decides to take away everyone's mobiles because of the cyber bullying. Anyway, she soon gets back with her old best friends and they convince her to go for the boy that she really loves. There's nothing that original in the storyline but it made a hell of a lot of profit at the box office so the concept must have struck a cord in many people hearts. Everyone either knows of a DUFF or was a DUFF so on that bases, the movie did work but I honestly didn't find it that interesting or funny. The characters were very shallow and everyone seemed to be into things like Facebook, Instagram etc, which I don't find that interesting at all . The love element of the plot was predictable right from the beginning of the film and it became corny after a while. Anyway, I was quite disappointed with the movie and I'm personally getting fed up with movies in this genre. Disappointing!Round-Up: Mae Williams, 27, has starred in over a 120 movies, which are mostly made for TV but I doubt that anyone recognises her. I remember her in Scott Pilgrim as the nutty Roxy Richter but thats about it. Her career started in the 1994 hit When A Man Loves A Woman with Meg Ryan and Andy Garcia and then she got many roles in various TV series like Friends, Chicago Hope and JAG. She also starred in Independence Day, One Fine Day with George Clooney, the Gingerbread Men and Hope Floats in the 90's and then she turned back to TV for a while. She didn't star in another major movie until Scott Pilgrim in 2010 and then she came back on the big screen in 2012 in the Perks of Being a Wallflower and the Factory with John Cusack. She also had a role in a Million Ways to Die in the West but I don't remember seeing her in that film either. Its the first major release for director Ari Sandel so I don't have anything to compare this movie to. Although I didn't enjoy the movie that much, there is a emotional undertone about bullies in school and how they can affect individuals in the future.   Budget: $8.5million Worldwide Gross: $43.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their comedies about a teenage girl who wants to become noticed after hanging around with two popular girls in her college. 3/10",The DUFF
25,matthewssilverhammer,Bad Version of Better Films,4,28 February 2015,"There's nothing worse than a near-miss. Unfortunately, that describes The DUFF. Next to its genuine cuteness and willingness to try faux- new stuff, it never quite nails its tone. Its unfocused perspective is amateurish. Consistently over-reaching in multiple areas (bullying, cliques, friendship, dating, divorce) the negatives ultimately overshadow the decent if familiar teen-based humor. Whitman plays the titular DUFF, a scholastically-inclined horror- film fan learning to deal with the idea that she may be the ugly one in her group of friends. From there, the rules by which the movie and characters live are juvenile and dumb. The dialogue, which boasts decent ""Gilmore Girls""-esque cutesiness, often feels less like real people talking and more like out-of-touch adults trying desperately to understand youth culture. Whitman, however, mostly comes out unscathed. She's funny, cute, and smartly funny as the awkward focus of this even more awkward film. Surrounding her, though, are a bevy of Old Navy mannequins trying to pass as recognizable and funny teenagers. With zero complexity and even less charisma, these ""mactors"" bring the film to a halt. More egregious is the confused ethics. Bullying, a recent hot-button social topic, is the focus here, but its handling of it is lazy and ill-advised. The moral could potentially cause as much bullying as it prevents. Of course this could be overlooked if the film was just funnier or more unique. As is, The Duff is a movie with a lot of potential but never breaks any new ground. In the shadow of Mean Girls, Clueless, Easy A, and 21 Jump Street, it's sadly a bad rip- off of much better teen films.",The DUFF

Mae plays a senior high school student that is informed by her friend and next door neighbor, Robbie, that she happens to be a Duff. Duff stands for designated ugly fat friend but the definition is a little loose on the translation. The duff does not necessarily have to be ugly or fat. It can mean a wing man or maybe the least attractive friend in a group of friends. As most people can remember, high school was filled with lots of little groups-the jocks, the nerds, the goths, the cheerleaders, etc- and more than one or two cruel bullies. Bella is the bully here that belittles her classmates who don't match her ideas of beauty. Mae decides to reinvent herself with the help of her popular jock friend, Robbie, and trades her teaching skills in science for his advice in being popular. Ken plays a cool teacher and Allison plays Mae's mother that has her own problems. The story is not all that original-anyone seen 'She's All That'?-but the cast is interesting and fun to watch. It's rated ""PG-13"" for language, teen drinking and sexual content- partial nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 41 minutes.

32,rannynm,"Hilarious, yet deep. And, worthy of a second viewing",8,20 February 2015,"The comedic movie, The Duff, is hilarious, relatable and worth watching. The film is about high-school senior Bianca, played by Mae Whitman, who finds out that she is the DUFF (Designated Ugly Fat Friend) of her attractive group of friends. Determined to change her DUFF image and impress her crush Toby, she turns to her popular neighbor Wesley Rush, played by Robbie Amell, to give her a complete makeover. Through her journey of transformation, she gains self confidence and shows the school that everybody is a DUFF. Not only do I enjoy that the movie starts off fast, but I really like that it starts with a cool, graphic newspaper clip that explains high school and the different types of people in high school. Being a high school student myself, I was really surprised at how relatable the movie is, especially to today's generation of teenagers. It doesn't just portray the generic, stereotypical high school student that is so outdated. The movie has a lot of familiar celebrity stars that I enjoyed seeing. The performances by Mae Whitman, Robbie Amell, Allison Janney and Ken Jeong are especially hilarious and very entertaining.The movie is hilarious, yet deep. Most comedy movies are really funny, yet pointless or lack an overall message. I laughed so often and even shed a tear in a heartfelt scene. The facial expressions are priceless and memorable. I respect this film for being extremely funny while also having a deep, motivational moral lesson and theme. I enjoyed the plot and moral of the story as much the comedy. The movie has a lot of references that are very comical. One example is an episode of the Simpsons that the movie shows. The movie also has really entertaining graphics that make the movie even more unique, some of this include labels and an interactive screen effect.This film is one I will watch multiple times and tell my friends to watch, yet I do not recommend it as a family movie. The film may be inappropriate for children under the age of 13 due to inappropriate language and actions. I definitely recommend the movie for teenagers in high school, especially girls.

The movie does spend a lot of time making fun of her for being ""unattractive"" though.To be fair, there is a LOT of fun with her being awkward, which isn't the same thing as unattractive.This movie has the same sort of feel to it that ""Juno"", ""Superbad"", and ""Easy A"" have to them, all good high school social dramedies.While some of the movie feels like sketch writing for ""how to lie your way to victory"", it doesn't disappoint.",The DUFF

I have always high school comedies such as Sixteen Candles (1984), The Breakfast Club (1985), American Pie (1999), Bring It On (2000), Mean Girls (2004), and Superbad (2007). I was really exciting about seeing The DUFF, as there as hasn't been a whole lot of teen comedies recently. This movie follows Bianca Piper (played by Mae Whitman), a high school senior who's learns she has been labeled the DUFF, short for Designated Ugly Fat Friend, by her classmates. The DUFF is basically the friend who is least prettiest in a group. Bianca decides she must reinvent herself, and then turn the tables on snobby hot-girl Madison Morgan (Bella Thorne) to restructure the school's society.This film reminded me a lot of Mean Girls, it deals with similar themes of high school popularity and spreading rumors. While its not quite on the level of Mean Girls, its still very clever and very original. Mae Whitman and Robbie Amell (who plays the football jock who Bianca gets help for advice) have some good comedic chemistry. Bella Thorne also plays an interesting role, as one of Bianca's classmates who is very snobby and judgmental, and tries to throw her under the bus. She is a lot like Rachel McAdam's character from Mean Girls. I did find it kinda weird for Mae Whitman and Bella Thorne to be playing classmates as Whitman is nine years older than Thorne. I also loved Ken Jeong, who plays Bianca's teacher. Overall, I was satisfied with this movie, I had its funny scene here and there, especially when Mae Whitman and Robbie Amell is on screen.

39,blott2319-1,"Doesn't try anything new, should have tried",6,29 June 2020,"The DUFF is a movie that tries to take the teen rom-coms that everyone is used to and move them ahead into the 2010s. It attempts to show how the forming of cliques has changed and how relationship dynamics are different. However, if this movie is any indication, the more things change...the more they stay the same. I've seen this movie before and it was back in the 1990s, when another film was released that has almost all the exact same story beats as this one. I won't specifically mention the movie because that would spoil what happens in this film, but this is an extremely predictable plot if you've watched any other teen rom-coms. The only thing new this movie brings to the party is its concept of The DUFF, which stands for ""The Designated Ugly Fat Friend."" The DUFF concept suggests that in any group of friends there is the one person who is not quite as desirable as the others, who becomes ""the approachable one"" that people will use in order to get closer to their hotter friends.While I was more than a little offended by the mere implication that Mae Whitman (who plays the titular DUFF of the film) was in any way ugly or fat, I did appreciate that they clarified that those designations were more generalizations of people who filled this role, and not all people looked on as their group's DUFF are truly ugly or fat. I found the film to be watchable, and it has all the patented moments you expect from this genre. I was kind of hoping they were going to do something different with the story, because they laid the groundwork to take the plot in an unexpected direction and do something new and original. Don't get me wrong, doing the same old thing isn't bad, because it can still give you a warm fuzzy feeling. But in this case, they didn't do the same old thing in a way that was special enough to set this apart from countless other movies.

If it's just a buddy and me, then no trouble. If he decides to bring someone else, then part of me feels violated. It's not that I want my bud all to me, but he should know by now that I can't stand people that come along for the purpose of tagging along. That's not to say that the sudden visitor can't be interesting. If I'm not told of a newcomer, then my friend is allowing him to have dinner with us because something is bugging him.Another assumption that I make is that he's brining someone else not out of pity, but out of ego. My best friend is not good looking enough to lead a group of friends on his own, so he (okay us) have held this system since elementary school that we'll group up with cooler kids in case we needed the chance in social status. This has allowed us to lead two clubs and have even played roles in the student ASB in high school. One girl tests the unbound waters of high school social statuses and cliques in The Duff. A cult film fanatic Bianca (played by Mae Whitman) is in the middle of her senior year in high school and seems to be in a good position with her friends, Jess and Casey. They all attend a party that goes bad rather fast when a neighbor boy Wes, who is also a star player on the schools football team, stupidly reveals that Bianca is the duff (Designated Ugly Fat Friend). Wes tries to explain that one does not need to be ugly or fat to be the duff, that makes Bianca mad enough to throw her drink at him and leave the part. Bianca grows to realize that she is the duff of her friends and breaks it off fast enough that the word spreads online (there's a lot of social media references in this movie). Now knowing of her position in school as a approachable but not datable girl, she turns to Wes in help with changing her identity. They strike a deal that if he can help her get a date with Troy, a guitar boy she likes, then she will help Wes pass his science class. Poor Bianca also has to deal with a bully girl Madison, who wants to be a future reality TV star, her school's newspaper teacher Mr. Arthur (played by Ken Jeong) and her criticizing mother Mrs. Piper (played by Alison Janney).The Duff is formulaic and I mean really formulaic. I'm talking about Saved by the Bell kind of repetition that few films would dare go into as for being unoriginal.

Luckily, there is somethingMae Whitman.I'll admit that she made me laugh hard. I haven't laughed this hard for a high school movie probably since Easy A or Mean Girls. She brought a lot of spunky personality to a character that could have easily been made the dweeb. I wanted to see where her character was going to go with her sudden insight that people use her to get to her friends. The rest do fine, though nothing new (though Alison Janney got plenty laughs out of me). Had the setup told something new along side the unique character, we could have gotten one of the best high school movies, though The Duff is charming enough to at least recommend as a comedy. I'll give this eight duff beers out of ten (you knew this pun was coming). I'd say that the performer truly saved the story as it's nothing new.

Ignore the fact that the entire cast seems way too old for high school. It seemed they saved money by not needing a studio teacher on set.No one beaks a sweat in terms of their performance. It was fun to see Allison Janney and Ken Jong in supporting roles.The movie is extremely predictable. The ""crush"" guy turns out to be a jerk. And of course there's the boy next door.It has a few laughs and some good moments. No need to see this in a theater as it will soon play well on a home platform.",The DUFF
45,brookenichole-98054,Wonderful!,10,29 March 2020,"The Duff is one of the best teen movies I have ever seen! It conveys this amazing message about learning to love yourself. Duff is just a word but the meaning is impactful. Mae Whitman is perfect as Bianca. She's witty and fun as she portrays a girl who is trying to make it through high school. Robbie Amell was also great as the love interest. He learned to fall for the real her.
Overall this movie will make you smile and laugh.",The DUFF

47,bbickley13-921-58664,An Enjoyable new generation of teen comedy,8,24 February 2015,"I never herd the term Duff before and I don't know if it exist in real culture, but it made for a humorous movie. Bianca Piper is The Duff (Designated Ugly Fat Friend). Though it sounds very cruel when spelled out, abbreviated it just means your not as cool or as hot as the friends you hang around, and if your a teenage girl who was made aware of this by your idiot jock next store neighbor without previous knowledge that you were different from your herd, that could put you on a downward spiral.This movie is just more proof that teenagers don't change (technology does and social media plays a very large part in this movie), which is why the movie seems formulated. I would not spoil anything if I told you how it ends so long as you have seen a teen comedy before.I find the topic of the Duff fascinating. The character itself has been seen in every teen movie ever. It's always the main protagonist, the semi-cooler kid that wants the protagonist to party and the third wheel, that now has a name. For the first time in teen comedy history(I think) that third wheel got it's own flick and it turns out the Duff is funnier than the one liners we had it say over the course of time.Mae Whitman played the character with amusing results.I totally recommended seeing this film. highly enjoyable",The DUFF

I like a good high school comedy, and this had enough laughs to keep it going, but the story is so overused. Also, I wasn't happy with the outcome, as the good girl ends up with the guy who is a jerk. He doesn't fully turn around by the end, he's pretty much annoying the whole movie through.",The DUFF
49,ArchonCinemaReviews,"Not the next ""Mean Girls"" by any means but funny and entertaining enough",6,14 March 2015,"Take a look around and survey your group of friends, are they all good looking? Then you might be the designated ugly fat friend, or the DUFF.Bianca's life becomes undone when someone reveals to her that she is the DUFF to her prettier and more popular high school friends. Frustrated, she retaliates by instigating the status quo and social hierarchy at her school.This comedy finds its laughs as Bianca, played by Mae Whitman, desperately tries to reinvent herself and overcome DUFF status. A chronic DUFF, she can't do it alone, and makes a deal with her neighbor Wesley (Robbie Amell) to undo the damage.A fan of Mae Whitman, Robbie Amell is the clear star of this film. Playing an endearing jock without being a cliché is quite a feat and his performance is scene stealing without being a parody.From that plot alone there is not much to the story within the high school film The Duff. The film injects an archetype antagonist, played by Bella Thorne, the most classic mean girl ever invented. This character's existence is solely responsible for the plot feasibly being stretched to feature film length – otherwise the DUFF would be relegated to a solitary episode plot line on a WB television series.Though briefly marketed as the Mean Girls of the 2010's, it really is in an inferior class in comparison to the phenom that was (and is) Mean Girls.

50,MelbaMan1,Feel Good Entertainment,7,9 May 2018,"I enjoy watching teen movies to see what the young generation is up to. This movie gives the modern sensibility on final year high school students wading through the confusing labyrinth of romance and dating mingled with the vicissitudes of friendship. All with the absence of any help from adults, who generally are causing more stress than they are helping out. Feel good entertainment even if there is a little too much voice-over needed to explain what Bianca is going through.",The DUFF
51,James_De_Bello,6.5/10,6,20 July 2015,"Despite being one those very, very rare high school movies that manage to be over the top ""The Duff"" doesn't achieve anything original. It flirts with it but falls short with its ending.One of the things that sticks out the most from the film is how much it is influenced by John Hudges. Now of course that could be said for every high school movie ever made after the 1980s, but here in particular you see and feel many, many callbacks, references and most of all plot point similarities. Unfortunately 90% of what it takes from Hudges is the lesser elements from his movies. Most of the things that made Hudges movies good aren't present and it shows very bad. Moreover it makes a common modern mistake of vomiting all over the place technology references that feel so forced it's hardly believable. It rarely ever uses them as a mean to bring on the story, they are just a gadget. Moreover the ultimate message of the film is banal and ends up proving how predictable the movie is.All of the above is saved by some good performances, amazing one by Whitman of course. The film combines well crafted over the top storytelling with intimate moments that are made very believable by the actors involved. That is something really hard to pull off but this film manages to keep a fine balance for the major part. It rarely lost me which is something that many high school movies easily do. I talked about how it takes a page from Hudges (not a good one unfortunately), yet it also takes a page from ""Meangirls"" which works fine and makes for the majority of the laughs in the movie. Finally the film is simply directed with constant energy and it is very hard do deny it is sporadically entertaining to watch and sometimes even insightful, despite not being as deep as it should be.This is not one of the better high school movies in recent year and won't join the likes of ""21 Jump Street"" or ""The Spectacular Now"" by and means necessary, but it still offers a pleasant watch and a great vehicle for Mae Whitman's talent.",The DUFF

I am an 80's action fan, love Hong Kong action flicks but have a soft spot for really good romance movies, romance comedies.With that said, Duff has it all. Fun characters, a female lead that I do not hate, even a male protagonist/antagonist.This movie was really nice. Reminded me of 90's teen comedy flicks, at least the good ones. It has a bit of 80's flair also.DUFF is the Designated Ugly Fat Friend and that is essentially the starting point of the movie. A girl gets called a DUFF by a guy and it opens her mind, she is a DUFF.Movie was well acted, fast moving, nice music and had heart. Some adult themes were touched upon and it worked to drive this movie.I wanted to give it a 10, but I gave a 9.....because I want people to know I rated it constructively.Duff might be the best romance/comedy released in the past 10 years from Hollywood.9 out of 10, do not miss out, do be a DUFF.",The DUFF

I felt I needed to see one of the typical American High School films that all follow the same kind of storyline, with laughs in all the right places.......so I went to see The Duff. I was not disappointed, this film could have been made in any of the last 6 or 7 decades and it's meaning would have rung true with the audience. OK so perhaps cyber bullying wasn't around even as recent as the 80s but this story would still work. Look at Back to The Future for example, that's a film with a major bully who finally gets his comeuppance in three different time zones.....that's why this story will always work. In this instance we are talking of a girl's realisation that she is in fact her friends' DUFF - Designated Ugly Fat Friend, and the stages she goes through to deny, become angry, accept and finally deal with the situation. Striking a deal with her neighbour who happens to be one of the schools' 'Jocks' she sets out to answer her bullies accusations. All the usual suspects are there....the princesses, the nerds, the jocks, and the weirdos, it's like watching an old friend, and although it's dealing with some pretty serious issues, it's still just a story about Teenagers at High School and what's important to them. I may be in my 47th year, and the oldest one in the cinema, but I really enjoyed this film and could watch it again and again.",The DUFF
55,troyputland,Every Group of Friends Has a DUFF,6,14 April 2015,"For those who have been waiting for a new Clueless or Mean Girls, look no further than The DUFF, the Designated, Ugly, Fat Friend. Every group has one, at least according to Wesley (Amell) and the high school he attends, but this isn't about him, it's about his childhood friend Bianca (Whitman), who he accuses of being a DUFF to her two best friends. Times have changed since the discouragement of Mean Girls. A contemporary take on teenage life at school shows exactly this, and that there are different problems that American youngsters have to deal with. Bullying still exists, except now it is exploited by technology, just as Bianca comes to realise. The DUFF is funny in places, aided by Whitman's black sheep. Apart from its fetching phrase, this teen drama has little originality. The stereotypes are still there, as are the creepy teachers and boring headmaster. Ken Jeong flourishes as one of Biancas's teachers but improv actor Romany Malco is majorly underused. Moving these big names aside and you'll find Whitman a lovable rogue and Amell more than just a jockey.",The DUFF
56,monstermayhem32,The hierarchy of high school,8,26 January 2016,"I will say when watching this film, it was like seeing my old days in school in which there was a social hierarchy between the jocks, nerds, and popular ones. That character is Bianca who was considered the misfits while her best friends Jess and Casey were considered the popular ones that were recognized while Bianca was treated like an outcast. When Bianca attends a party by the cruel diva Madison, she finds out from her next door neighbor Wes that she is considered a duff which is designated ugly fat friend, however he explains it it is not being ugly but rather the least approachable of the group, she agrees to his help to change her image in exchange for helping Wes in chemistry and hopefully get her crush on Toby, I wil, say that the film itself does a decent job showing the trials and struggles of modern day high school along with social media.",The DUFF
57,Jerique,A wholesome comedy,7,7 November 2020,"In this tale which seems to take elements from Easy A and A Walk to Remember, Bianca (Mae Whitman) is told by her long-time neighbor and classmate, Wesley (Robbie Arnell) that she is the Designated Ugly Fat Friend (or DUFF for short).All Bianca wants is Toby, and will even help out Wesley to get that. In A Walk to Remember kind of format the unlikely friends become close and Toby is revealed to also believe in 'the duff' as he yearns for Jess and Casey, Bianca's friends, in the hopes that Bianca will hook him up.It all comes to a head with a She's All That-esque moment close to the end of the film. It's a low budget film, and there's not an all-star cast. I really only recognize Mae Whitman from Scott Pilgrim, Ken Jeong, and Allison Janney. Everyone else here feels forgettable.Although everyone fills out their roles and no one sticks out like a sore thumb, the acting is what sells the film. Mae has perfect timing for her on-the-button lines to finish off scenes. Mae is approachable, which makes Bianca approachable.I did find some things in the film out of touch, however. In the early stages of the blossoming friendship, Bianca dances and makes a fool of herself with a mannequin at the store while Wesley does his best to be Gerard Butler in The Ugly Truth. It's revealed that Wesley's ex is filming the whole situation and then later, Bianca accuses Wesley. It pains me how cringeworthy it is. Anyone with half a brain would realize he wouldn't do that and it was impossible to do it without Bianca noticing. The way that the recording is done is not subtle either.Aside from that there are sprinkles of comedic moments and quotes throughout the film. It's light-hearted and not raunchy like American Pie can be. It's got some taste and some brilliant jokes. Overall, it's worth a view and anyone who enjoys teen comedies with a bit of romance won't regret it.",The DUFF
58,mistoppi,Refreshing yet average at best,6,29 June 2016,"High school movies are almost always fun. They are completely over the top, because the kind of teen drama in movies doesn't exist in real life, at least not in this form, at least not where I am from. That kind of drama wouldn't suit in a movie, it's not extremely cinematic. (Our drama is so much more vaguer like there was a period that lasted over a month where about four people didn't talk to other five people because both groups thought the other group was angry, while it turned out nobody was angry at anyone.) So, The DUFF has all the highlights of cinematic high school drama: there are brutally mean people, there are so many embarrassing things the main character does that make the viewer want to shut their eyes from all that. It has the kind of pop culture and social media references that won't mean anything in ten years, probably. Some of those are outdated even know. Honestly, they refer to Robert Pattinson, who was in, like, five years ago or something! Someone who never lived through the Twilight phase doesn't necessarily get that. Of course The DUFF also has all the annoying little things in high school movies. Some people hate these things, some people love them because they are so tacky, but I don't know anyone who would say they like this stuff unironically. First of all, plot structure. While after five minutes you can't predict every turn in the movie, it's super easy to see what will happen next, how a certain scene will turn out. The structure is always the same in these movies. Sure, it's kind of fun to predict the events with your friends or so on, but it gets annoying. Another annoying little thing: everyone is the wrong age. Come on, Mae Whitman and Robbie Amell are both almost 30, and they are playing high school students. Why?While this movie typically has am emphasis on teenage romance and crushes, I love how eventually it's about Whitman's character coming to terms with who she is and just... loving herself the way she is, instead of the DUFF being all about Bianca getting the guy or something like that. I think every high school movie, Mean Girls, Clueless, all the others, are mostly focused on the love story and not enough on girls loving themselves and all that. It just was a nice change in the typical story. And it wasn't even just subtext it was exactly how it was. Also typically high school movies love stereotypes and being loyal to them - this means they can have one character outside the stereotypes (usually the main character) and then two-dimensional simple supporting characters. But most of the stereotypes are shattered in the DUFF. Sure, Bianca's neighbour Wes is a jock but there's more to him than that. There are a lot of characters outside stereotypes, or at least their cliques are very hard to place. It's refreshing to see characters instead of stereotypes.The DUFF has probably as many good things as it does bad things. It's refreshing from its typical genre, but it still follows too many clichés. It's an average movie at best, even if it's better than most modern high school movies.",The DUFF
59,Spideyfan-963-246215,The Duff Review,7,9 September 2016,"The Duff(2015) Starring: Mae Whitman, Bella Thorne, Robbie Amell, Bianca A. Santos, Skyler Samuels, Allison Janney, Ken Jeong, Nick Eversman, Romany Malco, Chris Wylde, Mahaley Manning, Tony Cavalero, Seth Meriwether, Gabriela Fraile, and Agnes Mayasari Directed By: Ari Sandel Review YOU EITHER KNOW ONE, YOU EITHER HAVE ONE, YOU ARE ONE When I looked at the poster for this film I thought to myself there's no way this movie is good. But when it was released on DVD & Bluray and I saw part of the trailer on demand on Comcast I became interested in seeing this movie. I was pleasantly surprised before I watched it to find out from my sister that it's based on a book. The Film is about a chick named Bianca who goes to a party with her friends one night to find out from her neighbor Wesley that she is a new label called a Duff. Designated, Ugly, Fat, Friend. She is the approachable who guys use to get close to her friends, people ask her questions about other topics instead of her. The film is one those teen movies that come out every few years, I believe the last one we had was Prom with Aimee Teegarden. Unlike that movie though this one is actually good. It has a few clichés of course but I find clichés to be good(sometimes) and here it's alright because already in a film with a good script that allows its actors to shine in their roles. Like Robbie Amell and Mae Whitman, Robbie plays the jock who of course the main chick is falling for even though in the beginning she doesn't like him. This is Ari Sandel's first directorial debut, okay well not really he's directed another film but from what I can see this is probably his best film out of the two. He has a nice style for character and setting. The Duff was a nice surprise for me, and I was glad I rented it was totally worth it. It has great characters, nice script, good acting and is hit out of the park with good direction. Even if it does have a few clichés, I'm giving The Duff a three and a half out of five.",The DUFF
60,CleveMan66,"""The DUFF"" will be to this generation of teens what ""Clueless"" or ""The Breakast Club"" was to their parents.",7,1 March 2015,"Every decade has two or three great teen angst movies that seem to encapsulate what it's like to be a high schooler at that particular point in the evolution of American culture. The 1970s saw ""Grease"" and ""American Graffiti"" deal with the 50s and 60s (even while speaking to the teens of the 70s). The 80s had ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" and ""The Breakfast Club"" (among others). The 90s had ""Clueless"" and ""American Pie"". The 2000s had ""Superbad"" and ""Mean Girls"", and the 2010s have had ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" and now, ""The DUFF"" (PG-13, 1:41).What all these movies have in common is the portrayal of teenagers walking that fine line between needing to be socially accepted on some level and trying to be themselves, even as they're still figuring out who that is exactly. When one of these movies comes out, adults often dismiss it as ""just another teen movie"" (which also became the title of a movie, albeit a spoof). Critical adults often fail to realize that they had a movie that defined their generation and probably still love – and that the current generation of young adults needs THEIR movie to help them see that what they're going through is tough on everyone – and that it will pass. ""The DUFF"" fulfills that role quite well for our current decade.""Jess has the hottest ass."" ""Casey has the hottest rack."" ""Bianca has the hottest friends."" That exchange between two adolescent boys watching a trio of friends walk down the hall of their high school pretty much sums up what ""The Duff"" is all about – attractive friends hanging out with a less-attractive friend who everyone approaches for dating intel about the other two. ""DUFF"" stands for ""Designated Ugly Fat Friend"". Now, the DUFF isn't necessarily ugly or fat, but IS less desirable than his or her friends and makes those friends seem even more desirable than they already are. DUFFs are unwitting gatekeepers, liaisons of sorts between their more popular friends and others who want to get closer to those friends. In other words, DUFF is modern shorthand for the ""wannabes"" or ""also-rans"" among today's teenagers.The DUFF that ""The Duff"" centers around is Bianca Piper (Mae Whitman from the long-running TV series ""Parenthood""). She is portrayed as the DUFF of her two best friends, Jess (Skyler Samuels) and Casey (Bianca A. Santos). Bianca doesn't even know the term DUFF until her long-time next door neighbor and popular captain of the football team Wesley (Robbie Amell) mentions it and then has to explain it to her. Bianca doesn't take the news well. But after a little classic denial, anger, bargaining and depression as she works through her grief over the loss of the comfortable niche she has carved out for herself, she arrives at acceptance – but only a transitional acceptance. She wants Wes to help her un-DUFF (or is it de-DUFF? Ex-DUFF?). Regardless, Wes puts her through a ""program"" of sorts (that he makes up as he goes) in exchange for some much-needed tutoring in science.Besides the main conflict of Bianca versus her DUFF-ness, there are several strong narrative threads running through the film. Bianca has a big crush on Toby (Nick Eversman), the school's apparently soulful guitar player and song writer. Bianca's mother (Allison Janney) needs to transition from self-absorbed self-help celebrity to caring and helpful mom. Bianca is increasingly tormented by the school's designated mean girl and self-described ""future reality star"" Madison (Bella Thorne) and her video documenting minion Caitlyn (Rebecca Weil). Lastly, Bianca has hanging over her head a dreaded assignment from her school newspaper's faculty adviser (Ken Jeong) to write an article on what homecoming means to her. This practically forces her to go to a dance that she never wanted to attend in the first place, much less in the light of the disaster that her life has become.""The Duff"" isn't a new story, but it captures what it's like to be a high school student in the second decade of the 21st century and entertains in the process. Wes' attempted transformation of Bianca has its roots in the now century-old story of ""Pygmalion"", this film is itself an adaptation of Kody Keplinger's 2010 book of the same name and the movie borrows heavily from its teen cinematic predecessors. In fact, the opening line of the movie is a nod to the closing line in ""The Breakfast Club"". While it subtly stakes a claim to that film's legacy, this movie immediately sets out on its own to update those old stories and tropes for this generation – and it works – mostly. Whitman is adorable and effective in the title role. She's also very funny – as is Jeong and Romany Malco as the square, but well-meaning school principal, plus, to a lesser extent, Chris Wylde as the science teacher. The film also may be a bit predictable, but it throws in enough minor curve balls and makes the proceedings entertaining and fresh enough to create its own legacy. As realistic as the core story feels, the movie does sacrifice some realism by overplaying the self-absorption of the mean characters, underplaying the reactions of the protagonists and allowing some of the story's details to become a bit far-fetched. (There's no way that a school administration would get away with or even try confiscating all the students' cell phones – and Madison's designated documentarian seems to have an omnipresence that would make any god jealous.) ""The Duff"" may not be the all-time strongest entry into the sub-genre of teen angst movies, but I believe it will stand the test of time. I can think of at least one person who won't be happy about that, but the former star of ""Lizzie McGuire"" is just going to have to deal with it. That's life. And so is ""The Duff"", at least for this generation of teens. ""B+""",The DUFF

The case like bullying and mocking each other are common in school however 'The Duff' teaches us about having low self-esteem is not the main reason why we cannot go on in life we should try to except who we are.In today's cinema world where movies with high-tech and sci-fi general stories are popular this movie is like a refreshment with the strong heroine character, handsome popular boyfriend, good best friends, and mostly the world won't shatter just because you cannot be the center of attention at least for a day are the main points of this movie. Also because it's funny.So watch this movie if you missed a good teen movie like years ago when super heroes movies was not as booming as now. btw it's a happy ending movie.",The DUFF

Even though this had a very predictable plot that you could figure out within 10 minutes this movie was surprisingly pretty enjoyable. I can't quite put my finger on it because this movie had some highs and quite a few lows, but the highs were actually pretty fun to watch. There weren't a whole lot of comedic bits in this film but there were a couple of sections that were a little funny, and not laugh out loud hilarious but more of a light hearted and fun kind of funny. And when these moments go away the movie slows down quite a bit and it is a roller- coaster for most of the movie. I really quite enjoyed seeing Mae Whitman and Robbie Amell together, they both gave some pretty good performances and their relationship is what made me stay interested in the film, even after it kinda switches going into the third act. The third act of the film almost completely ditches whatever fun comedic tone it had and goes for a more emotion filled approach. Although i didn't mind the third act, the drastic flip in tone caught me off guard and took a little to adjust. So in the end there isn't a whole lot i can say about this film, it has a predictable plot and all the teen comedy clichés you know, but the performances and characters make it fun and somewhat entertaining so you can get something a little worthwhile out of it (if you enjoy teen comedies).

I did not see that ending coming at all!Sarcasm!While being entirely predictable, it was actually an entertaining movie.The general theme of the movie reminds me of She's All That; cute jock boy and 'ugly' girl, girl gets transformation and they both ride off into the sunset together.Mae Whitman and Robbie Amell were the highlights of the film, the two of them have great chemistry together and made the movie enjoyable to watch. Allison Janney is always good to see on the screen, even in a small role like in this film.It was a bit hard to watch at some points; I mean is anyone as awkward as Bianca (Whitman) was in most of the film and some parts were just over the top, bordering on stupid.There are a lot of social media and pop culture references in this, every social media website gets a mention at least once during the film.Being as predictable and awkward to watch as it is, it was an entertaining and funny movie, and I think most of that credit has to go to Whitman and Amell.It's probably something I would watch again, but not until it comes out on Netflix or something like that.",The DUFF
65,Bravesfan17,Similar to the Films of John Hughes,9,1 March 2015,"I decided to see the latest high school themed comedy. From the trailer, it seemed somewhat mean spirited, but only a couple of the characters truly are. Bianca Piper (Mae Whitman from Parenthood) is a few weeks into her senior year of high school. Bianca is a hard working student who is also the editor of her school's newspaper. She also enjoys watching cult films in her spare time. Her best friends are Jess (Skyler Samuels) and Casey (Bianca Santos). When popular girl Madison Morgan (Bella Thorne) invites Jess and Casey to her party on a school night, Bianca feels left out, but ends up being there anyway. She has a crush on a guitar player named Toby, but gets too nervous around him and can't even come up with two words. At the party, Wesley Rush (Robbie Amell), the football team captain/Bianca's neighbor, tells her that she is a DUFF (Designated Ugly Fat Friend). Bianca's feelings are hurt, but she slowly realizes that he is right as she feels like she only is there to make her friends look better. Having no choice, Bianca goes to Wesley for help in looking more dateable in exchange for helping him improve his science grade. Seeing them spend time together, Madison does what she can to humiliate Bianca. Like I said before, the film isn't as mean spirited as the trailer makes it out to be. The only mean spirited characters are Madison and her friend Caitlin, who films Bianca twice to humiliate her. In a lot of ways, The Duff reminds me of the films of John Hughes. With this film, director Ari Sandel and lead actress Mae Whitman show that everyone can relate to being a DUFF. Sandel's work here also makes me think of Hughes in the sense of how the latter showed that teenagers are human and go through life obstacles. The standout in this cast is Mae Whitman in the front and center as Bianca Piper. Whitman did tremendous work the past five years as Amber Holt on Parenthood and shows here that she can carry a feature film. She is great here as this girl who overcomes obstacles with school, labels, and being dateable. The next standout is Bella Thorne, who plays the popular Madison Morgan. Thorne turns in a heck of a performance as the bitchy girl who thinks she is better than everyone else. Samuels, Santos, and Amell all do nice jobs in their respective roles. It was also nice to see Allison Janney, Ken Jeong, and Romany Malco all show up. The film has a lot of laugh out loud moments, interesting characters, and an entertaining story.",The DUFF

The film captures life, I mean the characters, and I'm mostly referring to Wesley (Robbie Amell) and Bianca (Mae Whitman), are realistic, humanized. I got a weird sense that I was watching people I knew and not a stereotypical film version of them. The movie has that documentary feel to it and it's due to how the leads portrayed their characters and how easy it is to relate to them.The only real disappointment I have with the movie is that I thought it would be funnier. It's still a comedy but it's a little more serious than I expected. Watching the trailer I thought that I would laugh a hell of a lot more, specially when you look at the established comedic cast in it. Whitman and Amell do have good comedic timing and The DUFF is fairly funny but the quality of the jokes are not as high as I hopped they would be. The story is intelligent, insightful, and kind of funny but it's still very predictable. The DUFF is on the edge of being great but it's not. @wornoutspines",The DUFF
67,Fudge-3,"Yep, it's another feel good high school movie",7,31 January 2016,"Fortunately the trailer teaches us what DUFF means because otherwise no one would know. It's that approachable guy in your group of friends who no one cares about but is useful for inter-group communications. You didn't ever know anyone like that? Me neither, go figure. But, as a film mechanic it works.Remember all that teen anxiety you used to have? Still got it? Yep me too. You're only comfortable with the people you know but how do you get to know someone new? If you're in touch with that feeling then this movie that explores awkward teenage romance will appeal.There are more laughs in this than the average teen movie. The characters are explored a bit more fully than in the average teen movie. It is a better than average teen movie.",The DUFF
68,rjsf96,A Sweet Spirited High School Comedy,7,26 October 2015,"In all honesty I was dreading my trip to the cinema to watch 'The Duff'; yet how wrong I was to despair. Yes it does not match the high level of quality from other high school movies such as 'Easy A' and 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower'. But it surpasses the recent batch of comedies and provides well needed laughs.Bianca Piper is a teenager in her later years of high school. She just wants to be reasonably popular and have a boyfriend. However all possibility of this happening is gone when she attends a party hosted by the high school bully. Her friend Wes explains to her that she is the designated ugly fat friend of her social group or DUFF for short. Bianca seeks help from Wes to change her appearance in exchange she will help him pass his science class.With a film like 'The DUFF', you need to bear in mind that it will not amaze you. Its sole purpose is entertainment value and ensuring that you have a great time, on that basis it is a success. That is equal parts funny and sweet.Mae Whitman as Bianca Piper is a marvel. This is mainly due to the fact that you do not pity her character. But can sympathise with her because we have all faced the same pressures in high school and how we should conform to fit in with our desired social group. As a character she goes on a remarkable journey and along the way teaches us that we should not be jealous of other people and appreciate our own life.Her voice-over that plays throughout the film is humorous and allows Bianca to say what she really thinks about certain individuals without verbally expressing her thoughts. Yes it takes some stabs at satire some too broad and others almost on the mark. This element just could have used some tweaking to fine tune it.The male lead is Robbie Amell who plays Wesley Rush. He is the sports fanatic but funnily enough is not a stereotype. That's because his character has a heart even if he speaks his mind far too often. Amell is a revelation in his first major film role. I expected him to be a manifestation of everything that is wrong with male leads in Hollywood. Instead he served as a welcome addition to the film, that surprised me far more than I thought possible.The chemistry between Whitman and Amell practically flows from the screen. They left my heart feeling warm and I for one would be more than happy to see them star alongside one another in the future. Their personalities differ significantly which makes it all the more entrancing when they offer their viewpoints on the world.It does not hurt the film a considerable amount but in some scenes it loses a sense of purpose; particularly when those scenes never lead to anywhere meaningful. Furthermore its messages are far too forceful and as a result lose their impact. A scene in which Bianca unfriends her friends on social media are funny. Until it becomes dragged out and the joke itself feels tired due to repetition.It was almost unavoidable for 'The Duff' to overcome its own predictability. It has several twists yet nothing that spins the tropes of the genre on its head. As soon as the film begins you can tell the direction in which it is heading. Many audience members will appreciate this familiarity but I would have preferred these scenes to be spontaneous so I cannot tell the ending of the film in advance.If you have never been a fan of cute girly high school comedies then 'The Duff' will not convert you. But for fans of the genre the presence of Whitman and Amell alone will substantially satisfy.",The DUFF

70,sunchick116-872-583383,Not another clichéd film,8,3 April 2016,"I see a lot of people comparing this film to movies like 'she's all that' and all the transformation movies and I want to make it clear right now this movie is not that. The main character in this film is told she's the DUFF and actively seeks help to change that. I love movies like 'she's all that' '10 things' but let's be honest, those movies are about bets and jokes on the character. This film is not that. Bianca goes into changing herself willingly to fit in and not be that person anymore. Another misconception is that the two main girls would be friends with someone like Bianca. I'm not the most attractive person, am also disabled, and was friends with the senior cheerleading squad and wrestling team AS A FRESHMAN. I'm tired of these mean spirited high school films when really my hard time was middle school. Anyway I digress. Was the film a little cliché? Yes in the sense that (maybe spoiler alert) she ends up with her neighbor she's known her whole life. However in no other movie is it a HOT neighbor. It's usually the dorky best friend who has stuck by through thick and thin. So I really liked that this film challenged that as well. I only deducted two points for the stupid fight the friends have to split up to begin with and because it wasn't nearly as funny as I was expecting. That being said, I'll still take sweet and cute.:)",The DUFF

She seeks help in dating advice etc., from Toby while at the same time Toby seeks help in his studies otherwise if he doesn't get his grades up, he risks looses his scholarship of wrestling, I think.

72,Paul-271,Nice Teen Angst Outing,7,3 May 2015,"Let's not get too serious about this one. It's a lightweight romp about teens finding their place in the often confusing usually unhappy mid teen years. The DUFF is a real term for the least attractive member of a group who exists as an approachable person who also makes others in the group look better. Here, the DUFF is typical of Hollywood's depiction of plain - good looking and with a good figure. Hardly ugly or fat but given laughable clothes to wear and often seen with messed up poorly done hair. We have most of the Hollywood / teen school tropes such as the best looking female also mean beyond belief. There the hot one looks rather laughable made up with a set of clownish lips which make her look anything but attractive. Paint her face white and the picture would be complete. So all the players shuffle around until they achieve a comfortable stasis at least until they graduate high school when they'll be back at it again but in different settings. A nice hour and a half diversion. No harm done.",The DUFF
73,michael-3204,We're all DUFF's,5,21 October 2015,"Charming, genial and slight high school comedy about a student who convinces herself she is the ""Designated Ugly Fat Friend"" (aka ""The DUFF') to her prettier best friends. A winning cast helps alleviate the razor-thin, not entirely believable characterizations. Both Mae Whitman, as the DUFF Bianca, and Robbie Amell as her next-door frenemy Wesley, a seemingly insensitive jock with a barely concealed heart of gold who agrees to coach her to become more date-worthy, exude enough warmth, charm and physical grace to make us forget that the actors are old enough for graduate school. The rest of the cast does fine with the cardboard they are given to play, with Alison Janney standing out (as usual) as Whitman's recently divorced, self-absorbed mom, a newly minted self-help guru who spouts slogans in the guise of motherly advice until eventually realizing the shallowness of her mantras. The film's biggest problem is that it lacks the courage of its convictions in almost every aspect. It runs away almost immediately from the boldness of its title concept and all the ideas it could explore about the way girls (not to mention boys) are evaluated and judged, opting instead for a warmed over pseudo-Pygmalion story that it then tries to spin into a lesson about empowerment and self-acceptance. Wesley is never the coarse ""man whore"" Bianca and her friends make him out to be, which robs the character of the arc the film wants him to have and makes us wonder why Bianca is blind to the guy that is obviously right for her. Bianca's crush on another classmate who is obviously not right for her is too shallow a story line to have the emotional impact the film reaches for, though I did find the film's ultimate resolution (at Homecoming, natch!) much more emotionally satisfying and resonate. If anything, ""The DUFF"" is an illustration of the long shadow cast by John Hughes films, especially ""The Breakfast Club,"" and how hard it is to do something fresh, bold or innovative with this kind of material. I give it props for trying and for not falling flat on its face, and for managing to let some good actors do some enjoyable work.",The DUFF
74,hthbrr2,"Love this movie, a bit too much improvisation, but it's forgivable",10,26 February 2017,"To me this movie is an instant classic. Love the plot, acting, characters, writing, even the ad-libs. Now just to get it out of the way it seems like much of the movie is improvised. Makes it seem unpolished/unfinished. Seems a bit rushed. But when you compare it to most movies these days this is truly a diamond in the rough. Would have been nice to have had less improvising. The older cast members are pros at it though. The younger ones kind played off like unprofessional, first draft, drama class kinda stuff. But I forgive it since this movie is so great.It does get a bit heavy handed with it's message I'll admit, another thing the ad-libbing does. But still it's good. Just feel like if it was more refined it would have been better received. The acting is great and casting is perfect. Everyone works well with each other. So many quotable lines from this movie, and funny scenes. I actually laughed out loud in this movie. The film is basically a well made make over movie. But with many laughs and lessons along the way. The pay off is nice and so many good comedic actors in this. Even the credits are funny! You can tell all the cast members had a blast with this. What happens when the set is too easy going, the whole ad- libbing thing. But even so the movie is a joy to watch already watched it a couple of times! Highly recommend it if you are a comedy, rom-com, and/or drama fan.",The DUFF
75,xenazues,Best teenage movie since Mean Girls,7,2 October 2016,"Well let me say I was googling teenage movies. Movie to try to get all the cool 80's movies I missed out cause I was born in late 70's which means the 82, 83, and honestly 84 year movies I missed out on. But this movie here was treasure for this generation who doesn't get to see great creative high school movies.In this movie there is a girl who has some pretty hot friends who are females. And her next door neighbor who also goes to school with her wants to talk to her friends. But he gets in conversation with her and then he tell her she is just the Designated Ugly Fat Friend which stands for DUFF as in the movie title. Never hear do of the word myself but it got me thinking. And it was creative or at the very least original cause nobody has ever said it in a film before. They kind of played off a few old teenage scripts,attractive surfer calvin kline looking guy is friends with a girl who isn't attractive by school standards (which they dressed the girl down on purpose, then changed her clothes later in the movie, she was good looking before the clothes change) along with a bunch of girls who look like super models who want their ex boyfriends back. Seen it a thousand times. But with comedy and introducing characters well. Some movies can pull it off. The key is comedy and creativity.The Duff starts out wonderful. It gives you characters, and explains them to you. Who they are, what their personality is like and lets you decide who do you like and who you don't like. And for the most part its not predictable (the point where it comes predictable is where they fail but that is more at the end).They went back a little with the plot for this. And adding new wording to it and also adding social media phrases. And didn't explain the social media. Brilliant move on their part. Technically everybody should know by now what twitter, facebook and instagram is. But they said a couple of more that I didn't know and I personally liked that. Good movies don't need to explain everything to the viewer. As long as they get what you are talking about they can use their imagination. Nobody explains what a boogie is in top gun. But you can image what it is the way they used it.Now for the bad things that happened in this movie which made me give it a 3 point deduction. I'm a huge fan of runaway bride but she didn't get her way either, she had to come back apologize, she came back to richard geres house. Not him going to her house and finally accepting her. So when I saw that the guy came running back to her and while just stood there I could have puked. I don't want realistic in my movies. I get it movies are fake but I seriously don't want to watch the plot that goes ""women does what she wants, not accepted, they mistreat her, people then find out she is great and the guy wakes up and goes after her after finally realizing she is the one"". We have enough of those movies. And right around when her mother makes her dress thats when the whole movie changes for the worse. The comedy in this movie is great as well. Lines after lines. The parts where she is in the store is something from her character I didn't expect. They threw in the teenage underage partying which I didn't take part in my teenage years but I always like to see it on the big screen. I personally will say this just a movie like a guilty pleasure. I'm an older guy and I wouldn't throw this on at a party or around a group of guys unless it was a group of guys and we all 25 years old along with some girls that age. This movie would be perfect for it. But if you are alone or with you girlfriend (and she better like high school comedy) this might work.",The DUFF
76,julescaroline,Dreadful,1,11 March 2016,"This was beyond terrible. It's a total rip off of the 90's movie ""She's All That."" That was a terrible movie too, but if you'd like worse, waste your time on this one. It's phenomenally annoying when producers use actors 25+ to play high school student. You spend the whole movie hoping or character development that never happens. Follow up sub par acting when a UN-inspiring make over. This movie highlights the onset of social media and You Tube in everyday teen life. I had no idea what they choose to watch, produce and share could be that bad. I'm scared for the world at this point. My expectation was closer to ""Mean Girls."" This made ""Drop Dead Fred"" look Academy Award winning. Save yourself the time.",The DUFF

Bianca Santos (Casey), Skyler Samuels (Jess), and Bella Thorne (Madison Morgan) play their roles effectively. Allison Janney (Dottie) also does well with her role.Yes, the plot pushes towards the genre rather than harsh realism during certain points as expected.

78,trvlers-77920,7.5/10,7,8 May 2015,"""The DUFF"" has the decency to acknowledge its roots in the great John Hughes teen movies of the 1980s—even beginning by referencing the five high school types stuck serving Saturday detention together in ""The Breakfast Club,"" which recently celebrated its 30th anniversary. But quickly and convincingly, it becomes its own funny and fast-paced phenomenon with its own modern-day charm. Much of the film's allure springs from Mae Whitman's performance as Bianca, the DUFF—or Designated Ugly Fat Friend—of the title. While Whitman is none of those negative things—and director Ari Sandel's film, based on the YA novel by Kody Keplinger, is quick to establish that DUFFness is a relative concept—she provides the film with both its grounding and its radiance. Quite simply, Whitman is adorable. After a long career of mostly supporting roles—including hilarious work as George Michael Bluth's mousy, religious girlfriend, Ann Veal, on ""Arrested Development""—this should make her a star. Whitman displays flawless comic timing and consistently makes inspiring choices in terms of delivery, reaction, even the slightest facial expression. She shines confidently in a self-deprecating role, and it's irresistible. She also has sparkling chemistry with Robbie Amell as the next-door neighbor she's known her whole life, who just happens to be the hunky, handsome captain of the high school football team. His character, with the studly name of Wesley Rush, could have been a typically vapid jock, but Josh A. Cagan's script fleshes him out better than that. Amell brings the requisite swagger but also a sense of humor and even a sweetness, which are unexpected. He keeps up quite nicely with Whitman, who's been at this since she was three. (Along those lines, Whitman and Amell are both in their mid-20s playing high school students, but the age disparity isn't as egregious as it is in, say, ""Grease"" or ""Beverly Hills, 90210."") Wesley is also the one who informs Bianca that she's the DUFF to her two gorgeous and leggy best friends, Jess (Skyler Samuels) and Casey (Bianca Santos). Basically it means she's the slight outsider in terms of coolness, popularity and fashion, and even though she's usually the smartest person in the room, she'd never realized this about herself. The discovery sends her into a tailspin (Allison Janney has some nice moments as her recently divorced mom who tries to perk her up with self-help platitudes) but it also inspires her to take action. She quickly unfriends both girls across all social media platforms and sets out to make herself over on her own terms. But she can't do it alone—she needs a clue—so she enlists the one person whose feedback she (reluctantly) acknowledges she can trust in Wesley. In turn, she helps him pass chemistry class, where his failing grades might cost him his scholarship to Ohio State. Naturally, there's a different kind of chemical reaction going on between the two lifelong friends, even though Bianca insists she has a crush on emo singer-songwriter Toby (Nick Eversman, who played Mick Jagger in ""Get On Up""). Wesley and Bianca also have to navigate the savage advances of Wesley's on-again, off-again girlfriend, the resident mean girl Madison (a sharply icy Bella Thorne). If you've ever seen a teen movie, like, ever, there's never much doubt as to how this tricky love triangle will turn out, but there are a few pleasant surprises along the way. Director Sandel's eclectic resume includes the Oscar-winning, live-action short ""West Bank Story,"" a musical comedy about competing falafel stands, and the scatter-shot documentary ""Vince Vaughn's Wild West Comedy Show."" Here, with his first feature, he keeps things moving at a lively clip, in keeping with the film's theme of the proliferation of social media. He even manages to find clever avenues into the tired tropes of the genre, such as the trying- on-clothes montage. But after bopping along deftly for a long while, ""The DUFF"" missteps toward the end by laying it on too thick with speechifying about self-esteem and defying labels. Even once was too much, but Whitman gets saddled with having to spout this notion a couple different times, when the revelations and resolutions within the film itself made it perfectly clear. Additionally, the world didn't need to see Ken Jeong doing his sassy shtick ever again, but he does tone it down slightly as the adviser of the school paper where Bianca is the star reporter. Then again, that's another example of how ""The DUFF"" defies expectations: It even makes Jeong's antics tolerable.",The DUFF

80,robertdegeus,Generic and Entirely Too Predictable,6,18 March 2015,"I had high hopes for this movie, it's not often that a comedy scores much higher than a 6.6 on IMDb. So when I saw this at a 7.0, (wouldn't be surprised it it's changed since) I was determined to watch it. Mae Whitman as long been on my radar as a fun actress, I of course remember her from her stellar role in Arrested Development, but she is also a graduate from Scott Pilgrim VS. the World, Avatar: The Last Airbender and Perks of Being a Wallflower. At first the movie impresses, somewhat reminiscent of Scott Pilgrim in it's abstract presentation. You feel as if you want to join her in her journey to become something better than she is, to become more than just the invisible DUFF.This first half of the movie is really the only reason I gave this a 6 rather than a 4. I thoroughly enjoyed it and found it fairly funny too.Now this first half sets you up for one of three tales: a) She gets the Guy (which after an incident seems pretty unlikely) b) She falls for her ""Jock"" Guide c) She has personal growth and realizes though she wants these things they're not important to her and what really matters is what she thinks of herself (and she rides alone into the sunset)This is where it began to lose me. They continued to attempt and do both story (b) and story (c). Both stories' poignancy suffered because of this. Her journey of self acceptance was hampered by her need of his approval and her journey for self acceptance made the romance seem unrealistic. They had a chance to do something else great which few movies get and that is to go past the teenage happy ending. After they first kiss, long before they get together, they had an opportunity to put them together and explore the facets of a high school relationship. For example, in the beginning she repeatedly states he is a man whore. Does the end of the movie mean to tell me that suddenly she doesn't think about all the girls she's seen him hook up with through her window in the house next door? Even though this problem was well set up, it was never realized which was a missed opportunity. There were two saving graces to the film, one is the Asian teacher. He outshone everyone in the movie and every line the sprung from his mouth was gold. Second is the relationship between the ""jock"" and the ""duff"", just like a real relationship they're weird and that, to me rung true. Overall I would rate this film a 6.2, not a bad movie date, but as far as film goes, really disappointing.",The DUFF
81,lmt_is_me,Very enjoyable rom-com,7,27 May 2015,I really enjoyed this movie. The acting by almost all parties was great. Mae Whitman and Robbie Amell had great chemistry together. The film showed what really happens nowadays with social media BOTH good and bad. People can be so nasty when it comes to embarrassing someone on social media. You can see that almost every day. Allison Janney is also one of the best actresses around. She can do anything from comedy to drama. The addition of Ken Jeung just put the icing on the cake. Mae's character (The Duff) was at first very upset to find out what she thought other people thought of her. Her mom was the comic relief with all of her mantras and you wondered if she really understood what her daughter was saying. This movie is light hearted and definitely worth the watch.,The DUFF
82,pronetomovies,kinda cliché,10,10 November 2015,"You know those films where the hot guy is dating this super model type of girl and out of nowhere he fell in love with Ms. Nobody? Well this one is one of those films BUT I like the idea of where Bianca (Mae Whitman) isn't the loner girl and doesn't go to parties just because she rather stay at home and read Shakespeare's infamous Romeo and Juliet. This film is somehow connected to the reality, to what actually happen to some people around the globe or should I say to some ""girls"". I know for a fact that there are these girls who wear baggy clothes and always wear the same t shirt every 2 days and when they are being asked ""why are you wearing the same clothes everyday"" she would respond with ""have you heard of washing machine before?"" well Bianca is that kind of girl because I could pretty much relate to her. I think after watching this she has become one of my spirit animals, you know. She's just funny and doesn't really make a big deal out of everything until someone pointed it out to her which is I think no one could prevent from really, You know when you're happy and contented someone will just ruin it for you and you'll just think about it for the rest of your life until one day you woke up and thought ""only i could define myself"".

It always made you laugh and the characters were amazing, I enjoyed it so much that I brought the book. It made me think what if I was the DUFF in my old high school friends, but if I was then I would accept it because this film made me release that labels don't matter unless you make them matter. One of my favourite characters has to be Bianca, Wesley and Madison, Madison because she is just straight up diva and that's funny to me, Wesley because he is SUPER HOT and Bianca because she is just an awesome actor. My favourite scene has to be when Wesley finally realises that he like Bianca and he rushes up to her and kisses her. If you like comedies or just cute guys then this is for you.",The DUFF
84,Harbinger_3781,A little review on the characters from The D.U.F.F,8,15 June 2015,"Hmm. I gave this movie an eight... probably because the topic synchronizes with the current age and mind sets I'm in. The comedy, the acting, and especially the casting choices contributed to the eight. For now I won't talk about the plot, because they'll *definitely* give out spoilers, so I'll just chat about some of the stand out casts.Stand at front and center is our lead lady, Bianca Piper, played by Mae Whitman. It was fun having having Whitman as the ""Ugly- Duckling-Turned-Swan"" character(we all saw that coming; the Chinese translation of this movie was ""The Springtime for the unattractive beauties""), but I gotta say that in a certain sense, Whitman was a questionable choice. True, the casting made her a character that's average-looking, kinda round-shaped, in order to make her two companions stand out, but even with all her figure and no makeups, isn't she still, like, the prettiest girl in that school? I mean, she's smart, funny, makeup-free, a total brainiac... Maybe it's just me being preferential - have been liking her since her minor role in Independence Day, but her talents really did brought us amazement - From Scott Pilgrim to Parenthood, this lady really keeps surprising us in both acting and comedic performances. In short, to me, it's more like Samuels and Santos brings Whitman's character out.The male lead was one of the main reasons I started following this movie. Wesley Rush, played by Robbie ""Firestorm"" Amell. I'm not kidding - he's really like a firestorm these days, both his professional and personal lives are quite awesome. Ever since his days as Stephen Jameson on The Tomorrow People he bilped on my radar and never dropped since. Then his Firestorm role was amazing - especially so during that The Flash episode when he teamed up with his real-life cousin Stephen, who plays Green Arrow on Arrow. Before that he was in smaller movies like Picture This, Struck by Lightning, and even a guest starring on Pretty Little Liars. Since that he seems to have started his intro into the big leagues. Hope to see more of his performances in more renounced movies in the future.Next is the movie's main antagonist, Madison Morgan, played by Bella Thorne. This is not her first significant role as a self-centered lady jerk already - her first checkpoint as a really awesome movie antagonist was during her days on Alexander and the Terrible... Day. Her portrayal as the movie b*tch shows that she can be amazing at literally any roles. Besides, bad guys get the best lines.Skyler Samuels and Bianca A. Santos plays the left and right wing in Bianca's holy trinity group of girls. Not much about Santos(this movie marks Santos' first blip on my radar), but Samuels was great. Before this movie I watched Helicopter Mom, with her as female lead, and she stunned me. Totally the possible legit next-gen acting gem. She got the looks, she got the skills and she got all tools of the trades. The group looks really inseparable any ways - Samuels portrayed the looks, Santos the strength, and Whitman the wisdom.And finally in the end part - which means the most important one - Mr. Arthur, played by Ken Jeong. I gotta say, watching Jeong here was really neat - he changed his outfits, and his portrayal here was phenomenal - best one in the movie. Truth be told, his role here; not only did he successfully portrayed a legitimately wise teacher - the wisdom, the care, the just, the calm... but the main reason I said ""best one in the movie"" was because nothing but his role here successfully and completely washed off the smudge he caused in my mind with that idiotic Asian role in Transformers: Dark of the Moon. I mean, him in a Michael Bay film(no offence to the director - he still makes neat movies), drinking Shuhua Milk and saying it out loud(WTF?), then that scene at the toilet with Shia LaBeouf... jeez. Admit it, this one Ken Jeong role can totally clean up that ""Deep Wang, Deep Wang, Deep Wang..."" mess ten times.Alright, Think that's about all the significant ones. This movie is very fun to watch, so if you get a chance, try not to hesitate.",The DUFF

86,Melissaslist,in what world is mae whitman fat and ugly?,1,16 March 2015,"Only in Hollywood could you get away with calling a smart sweet and yes very pretty and slim girl the fat ugly friend. Maybe she was slightly less glamorous than the other two but truly the height of absurdity to suggest that she's unattractive. Reminded me of similar idiotic TV episodes or movies where some girl has glasses but a knockout otherwise but not until her cliché makeover. Ie removal of the glasses are you able to see her true beauty.This movie has been done to death and way funnier and better story. The mean girl was off the charts ridiculously mean so much so that it didn't seem at all believable. Clearly from the beginning you were certain shed end up with the guy. You knew there would be some big speech at the homecoming dance where she wins everyone over after lecturing the mean girl about how being mean sucks while demonstrating how she can not only be herself but also be socially accepted and get the guy. I could go on but won't. I read a magazine review telling me to see this movie.in the future I'll just go with my gutt. The trailer looked lame but I went and saw anyway. A few similar movies that may not win any awards but I found far more entertaining; can't buy me love. Never been kissed, muriels wedding, valley girl, 16 candles, pretty in pink.

87,mhol111964-754-567942,One of the more mediocre attempts at teen satire,2,10 July 2015,"There is nothing to say about this film besides that it's an uninspired pile of drivel. It desperately tries to be the next ""Mean Girls"" and it fails miserably on every level.The storyline is utterly ridiculous. We have the two attractive girls who are buddies and have an unattractive friend dubbed ""The DUFF"" (Designated ugly fat friend) to use to make them look better. Who does that? It is also loaded with clichés. Like we have this loser trying to fit in with the popular students and gets recognition from a viral video.Also, we find out that her ""lover"" is actually not in love with her at all and dubs her ""DUFF"" like everyone else at her school. How original.The characters are very unlikeable. Our protagonist Bianca gives us very little to no reason to root for her. Both the guy that she is in love with and the guy who she seeks help from are both pretty much jerks. Also, in most of these type of films, the ""mean"" character, while purposely unlikeable, at least has some sort of likable personality and is entertaining and you would love to hate him/her. But here, you don't exactly love to hate Madison Morgan.The humor is bland, uninspired, and painfully unfunny. I did not laugh once.On a positive note, Mae Whitman was actually pretty good in it. She portrayed her role quite respectively.Maybe there is a good movie hidden there, but overall, I was not impressed with it whatsoever, and I would not recommend it.If you are looking for a good teen comedy satire with a female lead, where the protagonist gets widespread attention from everyone else at her school, watch Mean Girls or Easy A.",The DUFF
88,district-23105,Not an Original Thought in Its Head,6,27 July 2018,"In terms of high school movies, this movie is the DUFF. There are more attractive, interesting, exciting, less predictable, and better told stories out there. That said, I liked this charming little rom-com quite a lot, and had it been the only one of its kind then this easily could have been a strong 8. It's funny, it's cute, and it's got a lot to like.But then, the negatives: there's not a single original thing in this movie. It's just so utterly derivative of all the mean-girls / rom-coms in existence it's practically textbook stuff. There's just nothing new here, and in fact it's all just one rom-com trope after another, which doesn't sit that well with me.Sure there's the cyber bullying issue, but it's basically glossed over in the most superficial way as to make really no difference to the movie. But if you're willing to overlook the fact that it's taken all the best bits from all the other movies of its ilk, then this is actually a surprisingly heartwarming little movie. I was incredibly disappointed with the ending, but I guess that it was inevitable from the very start. I should have known better than to expect anything else from this kind of movie.6/10. Could do better. The two leads are great, in fact the entire cast is great. Ultimately, I guess when you're buying bubblegum you expect to get bubblegum, and that's exactly what you're getting here. The DUFF needs a few original ideas, but overall, watchable on a rainy day.",The DUFF
89,Yesh4,The movie vs the book,10,13 December 2015,"Okay so I watched the movie before i read the book and normally if i've watched a movie first i wouldn't read the book afterwards. but because i saw loads of people complaining about how drastically different they made it i thought i'd give it a go . So I really loved the movie so much but then i read the book and it was so much better and the plots are different the only thing the same is the names of the characters and the term duff. anyway so i thought i'd make a list of the differences just in case anybody couldn't be bothered to read the book or vice versa. obviously SPOILERSIn the movie: There's a ''mean girl'' called MadisonWesley agrees to make Bianca dateable in exchange she helps him pass science. Bianca initially doesn't like Wesley, but they become friends fairly quicklyBianca's dad and mum are divorced and she lives with her mum who is a motivational speaker. her dad is not seen in the movie only mentioned.The main love interest Toby tucker is supposed to be this sensitive guy who plays guitar.Homecoming dance is where Bianca realises she loves Wesley and they kiss and she realises everyone is a duff etc.In the book: There is no specific mean girl.Bianca really despises Wesley a lot more than how it came across in the movie. But they end up being f--- buddies as she uses sex as a form of escapism during her parents divorce. Bianca lives with her dad who has had problems with alcoholism in the past. Her mother travels a lot and is never at home, gives motivational speeches after writing a failed self-help bookBianca specifically states in the book that Toby Tucker is not one of those people that plays guitar instead he is quite a nerdy,polite guy.There is no home coming dance in the book but the place where Bianca realises she loves Wesley is at a place called ''the nest'' which is like an underage bar type thing. Wesley's arrogance is a lot more emphasised in the bookIn conclusion i feel that the book was more original and had more substance. The movie is a lot more watered down but it has to be to fit the 12 rating but it had a really good message as well. the book and the movie should be enjoyed as separate things because they are that different.",The DUFF
90,FilmFestAsh,The Duff succeeds where other teen high school makeover comedies fall short,6,7 August 2019,"For those familiar with the 2004 film Mean Girls I won't need to say any more than The Duff is Mean Girls rebooted - and yes, it's almost as good.The writers have infiltrated the most up to date tween-isms (which will leave older viewers/reluctant chaperones at a loss most of the time) but effort has been made to not talk down to those the filmmakers are emulating nor belittle the classroom issues which seem so insurmountable at the time.Films like The Duff live and die by their leads, on whose shoulders rest the narration as well as the storyline and luckily, Mae Whitman, (despite her 26 years) nails it as the humbly hilarious high-schooler, desperate to redress the balance of popularity, Bianca. She's as kind-hearted if a little more self-affirmed than Lindsay Lohan's Cady (Mean Girls) and miles from the pathetically doe-eyed 'heroines' treated to makeovers in girl-flicks of yesteryear.The Duff succeeds where other teen high school makeover comedies fall short due to all of the above sparking off each other in the same way Oscar shock-winning, sleeper-hit, Juno came out of nowhere and settled right into the 'classic' category almost ten years ago.All that having been said, you'll hate this unless you're female and under 16 or within the very specific age range of 25-29 and pining for the aforementioned girl-flicks The Duff appears to have been made in homage to.",The DUFF
91,Blogger66,A Movie for Every High School Kid!,7,24 August 2015,"Funny how the title of the movie captured my attention by thinking of Hillary Duff. Fortunately, it has nothing to do with her. It's a realistic comedy directed by unfamiliar director, Ari Sandel. It's about three girls who were close until they came in high school, reached at the peak where people's concerns about stereotypes and their status. Bianca, Mae Whitman, disliked to be labeled as the DUFF of her friend group, the Designated Ugly Fat Friend, even though she's looking quite hot. Her friends, Madison and Casey-Bianca A. Santos (I had to mention her full name because she's a kind of girl I'd want to b*** someday) were in a circle of her friends. Bianca realized the boys tried to befriend her to get through her hottie friends. She left her friends to create her own reputation. I don't think I'm the only one who felt the same when I was in high school. Don't get me wrong, I was pretty good looking guy with great athletic skills, but my friend's looking like a model. I was frustrated being friendzoned every time I bumped into a girl. Always got to the point where the girls would ask me about him. Instead of rejecting him as my friend, I rejected every girl. Still a lose-lose situation because people thought I'm attracted to guys. Even it was 15 years ago, my high school classmates still suspect that I'm gay. F*** that s***.Anyways, back to the story, it's not kind of a movie that you'd react like ""lololol,"" just ""hahah."" It's completely different from other movies. Definitely unique. I really like how it included today's generation like Cyberbullying and etc. It's perfectly coordinated with the reality of the environment in high school. Plus, it showed special effects in an unique way that's definitely suited the plot itself. It doesn't belong to be in lowly category of Mean Girl and Easy A, but it also doesn't deserve to be up to the standards along with Boyhood and Breakfast Club. Just right in between. Look, the life as a high school student is like riding on a roller coaster. This movie is giving a well lesson to lighten up what you're facing as a high school student. Prom, popularity, and such are actually meaningless. Don't take bullying or else personality because in the end, you'll laugh at the experience itself. For people who graduated from high school, I bet if they live back in high school, the first thing they would want to do is to belittle the fact of how they look, their status, and the way of doing things. The biggest regret is probably allowed the high school environment interfered being fully themselves. Speaking of myself, I wish I could see this movie while I was freshman in high school. I truly believe that it'll sightly improve on my outlook as a high school student. SO YOU HIGH SCHOOLER PLEASE WATCH!!",The DUFF
92,phantomastray,unrealistic romantic flick; cute through,5,23 September 2016,"If you're in for a light watch, click the play button right away.well, but for those who make their romantic picks very sparingly, I'd say this movie falls short in being able to develop into an ending that one can treat as satisfyingly ""happily ever after"".the whole story setting is of high-school romance. the lead actress(Bianca) has a crush for a guitarist/musician which settles as a sufficient persuasion to warrant all love-striken drama. However, slowly as the story unfolds, suddenly on an eventful date night, which she has been so wishfully waiting for, Bianca's love for poor guitarist wears off and she falls in love for her friend/neighbor(Wesly) dude who helped her with some dating tips and makeover advice.But wait, Bianca's newly found love just doesn't seem settling for viewers, since the story hasn't given them those handful ""take the breath away"" love moments. More so, because of which, Wesley's walk-off on his beautiful ex-girlfriend's rekindled romance, just seems so unfair for the poor lady.Overall this story could have benefited in developing some characters deeper, so that viewers could have empathized with their emotional u-turns.",The DUFF
93,barbicane3333,Absolutely marvelous!,10,1 March 2015,"Oh, to be a teenager again. My first ""encounter"" with Mae Whitman was when I saw her in The Perks of Being a Wallflower. She was my favorite character in that fine film. I fell in love with her immediately. I was hoping it wouldn't be long before she'd get a starring role. Now, we have The Duff.I saw The Duff today, and she - and everyone in the cast - didn't disappoint. Her relationship with Robbie Amell's character brought back memories of the relationship between Mary Stuart Masterson and Eric Stolz in Some Kind of Wonderful, one of my all time favorite films. I will now add The Duff to that list. This is a tender romance with plenty of laughs thrown in. The teacher characters reminded of some in Clueless. They're well-drawn and funny. Allison Janney plays Mae Whitman's mother, also a funny, yet very wise character. Ms. Janney has never delivered a sub par performance.I won't reveal the ending. I'll just say it made me so happy, I applauded. It made my week. A great date night movie or just see it by yourself. This is one for the young and, like me, the young at heart.

There were so many things wrong with this film that I don't even know where to start. The book was about how stereotyping is a pile of crap, yet the film strove to make stereotypes out of the characters. They made Wesley stupid and all about his body, they made Bianca 'awkward' and socially inept, they made Casey and Jessica look shallow and self-obsessed, and worst of all, they made Toby into an indie, guitar playing dreamboy with long hair. All the characters were meant to be AVERAGE (except maybe Wesley, who was meant to be particularly attractive), because the message of the book was that stereotypes don't exist and everyone is actually leading really similar lives and you shouldn't judge. I basically hate this movie and all that it stands for. If I could, I would give it a zero, because I was so disappointed that the makers of it had A* material to work with, real characters and real talk about the world, and they made it just another teen movie.",The DUFF

96,RachaelHP,Relieved we have a smart and grounded addition to this genre,9,19 September 2019,"Attempts made at this genre have turned my stomach in the past.
But it has also been breakthrough ground for many an actor, writer and director.In this day and age, originality or even a decent attempt at reinvigorating a tired story arc is rare but I was relieved and pleasantly surprised by this film.Mae Whitman and Robbie Amell have a commanding and heartwarming chemistry I honestly thought would never again be achieved in this age of shallow and genre over-kill. They gave a sincerity to the film that was its compelling foundation and saving grace, especially as they were given the term ""Duff"" to reckon with and make an endearing learning curve. Their interactions were a joy to watch and made for many an honest laugh which won this film comedic credibility.It also has Allison Janney. It also has Ken Jeong. It also has Romany Malco.
So, that's win for me too.It lost a point in not fleshing out Bianca's best friends. Maybe this was done on purpose but their dialogue lacked substance which I found bizarre amidst the rest of the film's promising and developed aspects.It does an admirable job in handling the awkward and the heart of the matter. It reflects on points and issues that could well be causing self-doubt among teens out there, indeed the world in general, especially in this social media-crazed society, and the film does so with a humour and timing that was welcome and unexpected.A definite recommend for any movie night. It's light, highly watchable and soon becomes a favourite.",The DUFF
97,josiahhilbig,"Cheesy, but funny and heartwarming",7,10 June 2015,"Sure, this film is a teenage love drama, and that fact is reflected in the script and themes, but it's surprisingly charming. It reminds me of older teenage dramas like Mean Girls and Diary of a Wimpy Kid. The sort of movies that you watch in school when you have a substitute, or a school event gets canceled.Those classic films, however, fall down flat in front of today's young audience because they're outdated. The DUFF has the same cheesy humour, but in a much more modern setting, and honestly, a good-quality movie about cyber bullying was sorely needed.While the chemistry between some of the actors was misleading, the lead characters were all surprisingly lovable. It was easy to empathise with Mae Whitman's portrayal of a socially-awkward ""DUFF"" in a way that made the embarrassing and awkward plot device all high school dramas have even more depressing than comparable films.Ultimately, the comedy was entertaining as well, and the more experienced comedy actors such as Romany Malco and Ken Jeong played a big part in fueling the laughs.The biggest problem I found with this film is the vulgarity. The chalkboard drawings of penises and erotic dream sequences are nothing that a teenager nowadays hasn't seen before, but it's still not the sort of movie you can watch with the family, or show a child before they enter high school.It's unfortunate that such an enjoyable film has limited its most likely target audience with its own graphic imagery, and I don't imagine this will join the ranks of classic high school dramas, because I doubt it will ever be shown in a school setting.",The DUFF

99,randaashraf-70075,A Pygmalion tale for this generation.,8,3 July 2015,"Warning : This Review Contains Spoilers Wonderfully witty and whimsical movie that Mae Whitman carries and steals the show as Bianca a clumsy yet sassy and funny nerdy, girl next-door character who follows the right path focusing on school and friends not style or guys and her chemistry works well with Wes (Robbie Arnell) the popular jock who is struggling with science.Another great film initiative of her best friends Casey (Bianca A Santos) and Jess (Skyler Samuels) are her friends despite her looks and style. However, Wes clumsily tells her what she was clueless about and really was not the case of her being the 'designated ugly fat friend.' That spurred enough incentive for Bianca to leave her friends and get Wes to help her get a new look and dating dos and don'ts in order to get the wannabe musician Toby (Nick Eversman) to like her.Yet as any popular girl has a posse of spies like Blair Waldorf. Here the Queen Bee Madison is Wes's ex (Bella Thorne) with a trashier dream of reality TV and dating older men as opposed to Chuck Bass and Columbia. But for now Madison is on and off with Toby and her reputation will be tarnished if her ex was seen with a geek and people speculated they're dating.This movie is definitely not ""She's All That"" but it's good enough for this generation and anyone for that matter. It's a timeless issue of popularity, love, friendship, etc. with a few changes in television and technology references and style. There is a lot of mentions of hash-tags and videos going viral and what not on screen which shows how bullying is nonstop today. Also, another issue again for instance, 'Gossip Girl' or most teen romantic comedies if you exclude excess technology such as, 'Mean Girls' or 'Never Been Kissed.'Not quite realistic but beautiful and shows how foolish and mean youth can be. This is as close to reality a comedy should be otherwise it would not be. The script is snappy and serious yet silly which teaches us that we should not take life too seriously just live in the now and be as present as we could be. This movie teaches a crucial life lesson that confidence is key not popularity but education and real relationships not a fake million friends. Timeless lesson must be put into consideration.

117,A-L-Ourson,Great film with believable teen situations,9,17 March 2015,"""The DUFF"" is great. It tells the story of Bianca, a sarcastic and nerdy high school senior, who finds out that she is the Duff (Designated Ugly Fat Friend) of her friend group. Bianca wears a lot of overalls and flannel. She's an honor student. Her tastes lie in old horror films and wannabe musicians who play with their hair too much. Bianca is cute, but since her friends are model –beautiful and outgoing, she, by default, becomes the DUFF. Hating her newly realized title, Bianca asks the school jock for help. Hilarity, cyberbullying, and unexpected relationships ensue.Mae Whitman and Robbie Amell do great as the leads. Whitman is charmingly awkward and vulnerable. My favorite line is probably when she comes down the stairs and her mom says ""You look crazy,"" and Bianca replies ""Crazy Awesome."" I think that pretty much sums up Whitman's portrayal of Bianca—crazy awesome. She has great comedic timing, and she avoids being overly dramatic in her sadness. Amell plays an equally charming asshole. He is the type of guy who is so cool, whether he is being a d**k or a nice guy, he is always cool. Amell portrays him with a cocky confidence that makes him both attractive and funny. Throughout the film, you can see why Bianca falls for Wesley, even though he does act like a stereotypical jock sometimes.There is of course a mean girl, and Whitman is the victim of some cruel cyberbullying, but she pulls out of it by owning it. The best part is that Bianca wins in the end by being herself and getting the guy, expected, yes, but who would want it any other way?One of my favorite aspects of the film is that the teenagers actually speak like teenagers, cussing and all. I find that teenage movies often go in two ways: weirdly dark ones with drastically dramatic teenagers, like"" Havoc,"" or innocent Disney-type films where teenagers speak like they're in the forties. I think this film is a good middle. Not too explicit, not too innocent. Just right.All in all, the movie is very entertaining, and it did get me psyched and ready to re-read the book.",The DUFF

119,stephaniedanyelle,A cute love story!,7,12 August 2015,"This movie follows two high school neighbors who are total opposite of each other. It's a romantic comedy that is extremely cheesy at points, but in the end they fall in love and your heart can't help but the skip a beat. This movie goes to show that no matter who you are, what your background is, how others see you.. that there is always someone in the world that you are meant to be with. It doesn't matter if they are a nerd or popular, rich or poor, black or white.. everyone has a soul mate, and hey.. they might just be living next door! The main neighbor boy isn't too bad to look at either, he's pretty gorgeous. His smile melts your heart and the way she can put him in his place makes you thankful that there are women that can still stop men in their tracks! All in all, I would watch this again. Cute love story!",The DUFF

Nothing else was on so I decided to give it a shot and figured it might help me sleep. I don't typically watch anything involving high school students because I find most plots, or lack of, annoying or the characters irritating. Not so for this movie. It was a quirky, funny movie that had me smiling and laughing. The actors, none of whom I am familiar with, seemed to have been perfectly cast for their role. Sure, you knew where this was headed, but even so it was a fun ride to the end. I might watch it again just for the fun of it and catch expressions and gestures that I might have missed.",The DUFF

123,carthait,Shows promise then devolves into generic feel-good garbage.,2,16 October 2018,"In the American film business, there are two types of teen comedies:1) Featuring a teenage guy as a protagonist, the message is almost always to never aim higher that what you are and be content with what you have - after all, hot girls are all shallow, so why not settle for your not-so-hot friend instead?2) Featuring a teenage girl as a protagonist, the message is almost always to never bother to improve oneself and that good things will be handed to you on a silver platter if you simply accept yourself.Both of the above are peddling toxic rubbish and both of the above are ubiquitous.The Duff is one of the those generic teen comedies that tries to pretend it's not formulaic garbage that's designed to lift up the self-esteem of not-so-popular girls by telling them that they don't need to do anything to improve themselves and they'll get everything handed to them on a plate anyway, but it is.It starts off promising when our main character, Bianca (played by the decidedly average-looking Mae Whitman - unlike older comedies where the plain girl was almost always played by a hot girl in disguise, at least Whitman actually fits the role of the unappealing, grumpy-faced friend), gets a rude wake-up call that she's actually not-that-cool by Wesley, played by the ever-reliable Robbie Amell. From then onward, Bianca decides to take her life into her own hands and become more appealing - starting from aggressively ditching her best friends and enlisting the popular Wesley's help in becoming ""un-duffed"".From that point onward, the movie falls apart. Wesley turns out to have had a secret crush on Bianca all along (and obviously, his much hotter sorta-girlfriend turns out to be a total b***h), Bianca's friends practically beg her to come back despite her acting horribly to them earlier and Bianca's actions never being brought up again and the end of the movie gives out a generic feel-good message that everyone sucks just as much as you do.The acting is cringeworthy across the board, with the possible exception of Amell, who at least seems to be trying rather than phoning it in like everyone else. Ken Jeong again tries too hard to be funny. Mae Whitman is serviceable, which was to be expected. Everyone else fails.I know that women are one of the biggest consumers of American mainstream media but this is not healthy. Encouraging teenage girls (and guys as well) to remain stuck in their ways and expect good things to come is a poisonous mentality. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this.",The DUFF

While I understand the comparison, if you want to get technical (and I'm not trying to), ""She's All That"" had traces of ""Angus"" in it. Everyone thinks they're Gene Siskel and wants to trash a movie, so they can feed their elitist mentality and convince themselves that they should be a critic for their neighborhood paper. Truth be told, I'm angry I didn't pay to see this...it was highly entertaining. My wife asked me to watch it, and I didn't know what to expect at all...I never even seen a trailer for it.

It seemed fun, it seemed fresh, the characters seemed to be genius and well-written. For me, personally, the movie turned out to be a big disappointment. There is nothing funny in the movie except for those trailer parts, the characters don't evolve at all and the storyline just fades away at the end. We've seen it all before and in better movies. And that's okay. I mean, for just another teen movie about high-school and insecurities, there are so many of those. Though, the ratio 7,0? Really? The same as ""Mean Girls"", ""Hector and the Search for Happiness"" and ""Heute bin ich blond"", and more than ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"", ""Let's Be Cops"" and ""Like Crazy""?

Sure, the performances weren't all great, the characters weren't all full developed and interesting, some even felt like the screenwriters didn't put too much effort in them, but if you see it as a total, it is really good. High School was and will always be the perfect background for a chick film. Teen relationships are complicated, the known suspects (the dive, the jock, the nerd, the cool kids, the indifferent one) always have a place in this ""prison yard"" that we call school. Adding internet to it is just expanding all the complications that can take place in a High School. I loved that the main characters seemed to grow and mature, I loved the dialogues, I loved that Bianca, The DUFF, isn't a supermodel, beautiful girl, playing the plain teenager that Biance should be. Mae Whitman is the girl next door and was very convincing for the role. Robbie Amell is the boy you see on the covers of teen magazines and on posters in girl's rooms, so he was the perfect person for the role of a jock, who takes himself too seriously. I saw The DUFF twice in a day and I loved it equally. I'll take the risk and say that this movie took me back to the 90's and 00's. It gave me hope that movies like this one will open the doors to better chick- flicks movies than the ones that came out the last few years.",The DUFF
127,katygreen,If you love teen coms.....,8,7 April 2015,"I think that teen coms are rare nowadays. Films about high school, the prom and fitting in socially are few and fare between. Yes, there was mean girls but that was over a decade ago. The last teen com I can think of was 'John Tucker must Die' (2006). I guess, there was also Easy A (2010) if you count that one. This is one of my favourite genres of films and I love this new addition to the genre!I think the film had the potential to be a lot funnier; there was a great cast and a good concept. Mae Whitman was perfect. I think there was a good chemistry between Robbie Amell and Mae Whitman. I think any great teen com has its own vernacular. DUFF has the potential to be adopted by teenagers and young people and enter into popular culture. It was serious at times but I liked the poignancy. The sad thing is, if this was 10 or 15 years ago it would do much, much better at the box office. Downloading of films and ever rising prices of movie tickets has driven films like this to the way side in favour of child- friendly blockbusters, endless sequels and huge CGI monstrosities. I went to see it at the cinema, not only because I was looking forward to a teen com but to support this type of film. I wish there was more of them. It was inevitable, but not predictable. Heart-warming, clever and of its time. Long live the teen com genre!",The DUFF

In fact, we have more labels than ever and that includes the new slang term The D.U.F.F (Designated Ugly Fat Friend). This film is creative, interesting, and very entertaining. The leading actress, Mae Whitman, makes the film enjoyable along with her co-stars Robbie Amell and Ken Jeong. It has a good story line, a good atmosphere, and there's a good message at the end. Something I didn't really like about the movie was Bella Thorne's character, Madison.

131,amandamanda-70916,THE DUFF,8,14 May 2019,"The Duff, this comedy romantic genre film, was released on February 20, 2015 in the USA. The Duff was written by Josh A. Cagan (screenplay) and Kody Keplinger (novel), a film that tells of a girl named Bianca who got a label ""The Duff"" because she was surrounded by beautiful and charming friends. Duff stands for ""Designated Ugly Fat Friend"", the name then made Bianca feel angry and became the beginning of Bianca's life change, Bianca began to get out of her comfort zone. Since she realized that she was the duff, Bianca began to have various problems, such as problems with her best friend, she got a bullying because of the videos circulating about her, and also definitely the love problems she experienced.
The film tell about love stories in high school are very interesting, in the whole film not only discusses romance, but also discusses a social relationship if viewed from the perspective of someone who is considered ""non-existent"". The
depiction of this film was correspond with the genre, a love story with a mix of comedy that is neatly packaged and right on target, although overall of the film dominates the element of comedy. Actors in this film can carry out their roles well and maximally so they can realize each character's, especially the female lead character, Bianca, played by Mae Whitman. Bianca in this film really portrays a person who can be said a ""geek"", lacking friendship relations, and also doesn't care about appearance, so the audience can further deepen her character. The film also raises the current situation, where social media can be a helper but can also destroy everything, in one scene in this film there is a part when Bianca's disgrace video is disseminated through social media so Bianca gets bullying, slipping the implicit meaning that the media social like a double-edged sword.
Maybe the audience at first was not interested in the initial scene in this film because it felt a little boring, but starting in the middle of this film it was very interesting with a series of events that could make the audience entertained because of the comedy and problem scenes. Not only that, maybe there are some scenes, that are just a glance not so clearly illustrated by the scene, and may make some viewers feel less interested, but overall the film is very nice. Viewers get a lot of moral value from this film, moral values are reflected in various situations and also portrayed lightly so they can be accepted by the audience. The most important moral value found in the film is ""no matter what the label is your way, only you can define yourself"" expressed directly by Bianca, actually there are many moral values contained in the film, such as don't feel inferior to yourself, do not easily misunderstand your friends, because friends who are always there for you, and also self-confidence is the key to everything.",The DUFF
132,mikiaf-33928,"If you love teen movies, you'll love this one!",8,8 June 2019,"The Duff is the American teen comedy film Released in 2015 directed by Ari Sandel. It may seem like a teenage cliche, however, it addresses the labeling that young people put on each other, the insecurity and the importance of friendship.Duff is based on the book by author Kody Keplinger, which tells the story of Bianca Piper, a teenager in her senior year of high school, who is a funny and intelligent girl who does not care about the way she dresses. However, Bianca goes to a party and finds out by the most popular high school boy and her neighbor Wesley Rush that she is a ""Duff (designated, ugly, fat, friend)"". She does not accept being a Duff and ends up being paranoid and analyzing all the tribes of the school and finding other duffs.So Bianca ends up fighting with her friends Jess and Casey because they did not tell her that she was a duff and asks her neighbor's help to improve her look. In return, she helps him to study for the sciences that he is almost failing.They end up having many special and funny moments together that it is impossible not to laugh at and fall in love with the couple. I recommend the film because it has a great message about overcoming and how the main character deals with bullying in school, and how to reject the impositions that society places on us and to accept ourselves as we are.The cast features Mae Whitman from ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" and Robbie Amell, ""The Flash"" Firestorm! It is a film that does not escape from the reality even turned by the adolescent industry that looks for romantic films that happen in the middle school but they present many important subjects and they do not focus only on the adolescent romance and it causes the viewer to reflect. The song ""All Night"" - Icon Pop is part of the soundtrack of the film.

134,Live_Dream,Would not recommend,3,22 August 2018,"Is this worth watching? 
Short answer: no.I'm a fan of Mae Whitman's, and I'm well aware I'm not the target demographic for this movie, so I went into this with a pretty open mind. However, teen movies don't have to be bad just because they're for teens, as Mean Girls has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt.But it is bad. Not unwatchable, but bad nonetheless. It left me with a bitter taste in my mouth that stayed with me long after the movie ended. Why, out of all underwhelming teen films, did this one stand out to me? After my second viewing, I decided to read the book. And there, I got my answer.What most bugged me about The Duff before reading was the friendship between the main character, Bianca, and her two best friends, Casey and Jess. Or should I say, lack of friendship? We don't see these friends talking and interacting and, you know, being friends. They have maybe two very brief, very shallow conversations before they stop being friends. This is a huge difference between film and book. Bianca and her friends are extremely close, but have reached a point in their friendship where they don't always feel they can share everything, as sometimes happens in friendships. This is the foundation for the entire book. It's what makes Bianca's interactions with Wesley that much more weighted - the fact she has to look elsewhere for advice when her friends are right there. There is also never a moment in the book that suggests Bianca is lesser than her friends in any way; all notions about being the D.U.F.F are false and mostly self-inflicted. In contrast, this movie offers a heavily male perspective because it doesn't just pose the idea that Bianca might be the D.U.F.F - it actually forces her into the role. Instead of friendship, what we do see more of are male characters that don't matter in the slightest to the plot commenting about how hot the two friends are...as opposed to Bianca, who is just there. Sadly, both of the potential love interests in this movie, Wesley and Toby, reiterate this sentiment. As for how the friends negate this stereotype - they don't. They are literally just there to be called hot, to look hot, and not really say or do much else.So what is the message of the movie then? That being a D.U.F.F doesn't mean you can't get laid? Sure, a movie doesn't need to have a message, but then if you're just going to be a fun teenage romp, why is this the message you're 'casually' dropping in?Kinda disappointing. Also, the addition of Bella Thorne's character, whose name doesn't matter, is pathetic. Please stop with Bella Thorne and her mean airhead act. I know the writers couldn't do better, but we should still expect better.",The DUFF

137,mli92,The DUFF,5,8 October 2015,"The DUFF: Movie ReviewThe DUFF (Designated Ugly Fat Friend) is a movie about a high-school girl, Bianca, and her journey to overcome the label her classmates have imposed on her. She befriends her two best friends, Cassie and Jess, because she thinks they also look at her as a DUFF. Desperate for a change, Bianca makes a deal with the football captain and longtime neighbor, Wesley. Bianca will help him pass Science class so he could keep his college football scholarship and in return, he will coach and transform her into a confident girl. She wants to have the courage to talk to her longtime crush, Toby. As part of her training, Wesley makes her try out colorful and floral outfits, and speaking to random men around the mall. Although both challenging, Bianca's biggest problem is the fear Madison brings over her. Madison is the popular girl from school and Wesley's ex-girlfriend. In the end, Bianca realizes, with the help of her friends and mom, that it's OK to be different and not fit into society's mold. Being different is what makes us unique and we should love and embrace it. Walking into prom, Bianca confront Madison and wins Wesley over. Along with getting the guy, she also earns people's respect by sharing her story and having it printed on school newspaper.The story itself is good although there are a few stereotypes throughout the movie. Bianca's character seems believable, but Madison's character, at times seems cliché. Altogether, the dialogue is appropriate for the age of each character. I specifically enjoyed the sarcastic and smart-mouth responses Bianca gave during the film. She was funny and I could relate to that. She never lost her humor although her character changed throughout the movie. In the beginning, Bianca cared a lot about what other people thought of her and tried changing herself to get noticed. By the end, Bianca realized it doesn't matter what other people think of her, as long as she is happy and accepting of herself. It's like she says, ""Yea I'm somebody's DUFF, guess what? So are you, so is everybody. There's always going to be somebody prettier, more talented, or richer than you, but it shouldn't affect how you see yourself."" I had never heard the term DUFF before, so that drew me into the movie immediately. The story interested and hooked me the more I learned about Bianca's character. The actors in the movie were appropriate. There were a few times where things seemed cliché, but overall, the movie was acted out adequately. One thing I would have liked to see is more involvement from Bianca's two best friends. They were present in the beginning and the end, but I think having them involved in the process would have added another perspective to the movie. The movie, however, had many different settings from the high school, the mall, Bianca's room, a thinking rock in a forest, Toby's house, and the prom location. I liked the fact that the movie moved to different locations. My favorite scene was when Wesley and Bianca were at the mall picking out new outfits. The actors wore age and stereotype appropriate clothing. Bianca wore baggy, dark, and casual clothes, representing her dark and care-free personality. Wesley wore casual, plain, and fitted t-shirts, showing his athletic build and laid back personality. Madison wore fashionable clothes with full makeup and hair to go along with her uptight and superficial personality. Madison, Bella Thorne in real life, is one of the actors I recognize from a previous Disney show called Shake it Up. The second actor I recognize from past movies is Ken Jeong from The Hangover. Ken plays an English professor that tries to push Bianca out of her comfort zone. The cinematography throughout was of good quality. The scenes flowed nicely and the angles and lighting was appropriate. There were scenes that seemed of lower quality, but it was because those scenes were supposed to be taken from Madison's friend's phone. These videos were altered and effects were added to them. There were also a couple of times throughout the movie where special effects like arrows and fireworks appeared. This made the movie theatrical and comical. There weren't many sound effects but the music played throughout the movie was expertly chosen, I just they would have added more songs, especially during prom.",The DUFF

It reminds me of the film Mean Girls, but with a fresher and more accurate view on high school life. When watching this film, I didn't want it to end but, at the same time, I didn't even notice how quickly the time went.

The ""duff"" girl is acting like a star. 5/5. You are rooting for her to finally recognize the delicate feelings for ""the wrong guy"" and when she gets there - it is beautiful. Makes me happy. Hopefully it will make the same with you. Speaking of the guy - also a catch. I think I fell in love. The characters reactions are so real, especially when first mentioning the duff concept - it dumps you. Honesty and the reality of youth mixed up perfectly. This guy is finally not the usual sexiest ever slash really gross guy, and you just fell in love with this story.

I'm always afraid that the script will basically be the book on screen minus a couple really important things that are really important to the plot. Here, some of the same characters are there, the main point is still there, but the story putting it all together is different. The heavier issues in the book concerning Bianca's family and Wes's family are missing in the film, Bianca's past relationship as well. I understand why they were taken out, but also would like to have seen how it could have worked.The casting was very well done, the jokes - both the obvious and the subtle were funny, and I was smiling by the time the credits were rolling.On the negative side I feel that a lot of the jokes were lost on my fellow audience members as American idioms don't always translate well, both language and generation-wise (there were only two of us in the audience who understood the Spinal Tap reference) and some of the day dream scenes were over top (fake porn).

It's really really really different from the book. It's so different to the point where they could have had a different title to the movie. Almost a completely different story. Some characters were cut/ switched out. If your going to see this movie have an open mind and view it as it's own entity. Don't expect a sequel either. Wesley is less of an ass in this story line. The movie is funny and quirky in it's own way. Thanks to the trailer it led me to the book. The main girl character Bianca aka Mae Whitman did a decent job with her role. I could relate to her very much like any other girl would. It's kind of corny but overall an okay movie. Not at all what i expected but it does kind of have a positive message to teenage girls/guys in the end. Pretty much it's like a modern version of not another teen movie / she's all that kind of thing going on.,The DUFF
143,dradutzky,Duff: Defined,8,19 February 2015,"I had the pleasure of going to see the NYC premiere last night with my sister and was pleasantly surprised. Mae Whitman's performance in this film has set her up to be Hollywood's next breakout star. She brings so much humor, wit and charm to the table that's going to make her fans wanting more. Viewers will also identify with Mae's struggles in the film, as well as the overall message. I think we could all agree that everyone has has a DUFF in their friend group. DUFF doesn't always have to mean ugly or fat (it can, but it doesn't always apply). One example of a DUFF can be a friend that's always just kind of there in the friend group and makes everyone else look better. Another example of a DUFF, which is similar to Mae's character in the film, is the friend of the group that is hilarious and makes everyone die laughing, but is rarely someone a guy is attracted to or would be looking to date. There are different dimensions to the term duff. No duff is the same.Every one person can have a little DUFF in them. Meaning, a flaw, insecurities, etc. Overall, the film was funny, even a bit crude at points, but also very touching. I'd definitely recommend it.",The DUFF
144,hstylios,Great!,10,21 February 2015,"Great movie! I just went to see it and I loved the DUFF. The movie showed cyberbullying and how it can affect people and hurt their feelings. It also showed people going above their ""labels"" and finding self confidence inside themselves. The movie brought out the most common ""labels"" in high school like : the football players (jocks), pretty girls (popular), and the smart kids (geeks). I don't think labels should define anyone whether or not they have a lot of money, good looks, smart in school, great at sports, etc. Although the DUFF's movie rating is PG- 13 there is A lot of colorful language in the movie. I think the director picked great actors and actresses for the movie DUFF.",The DUFF
145,akiramobley,😭,2,13 March 2015,"It's awful. I honestly thought it would be worse though so that's a first. The book was more original and Bianca was a tough girl who didn't really mind being a duff. She started using Wesley, in a totally different way from the way they do in the movie 😄, to get over the fact her parents are getting divorced, since her mom's not around (not that it would be alright to have her dad hit her and be drunk like in the book). She also was in relationships, with her best friends brother(she didn't know) and he came back. So she needed Wesley(not a jock, but a rich kid with parents who weren't around). Also the real Bianca would never dump her friends. They ruined Toby. He was actually really smart and was going to be a politician. Also, there was no mean girl. Overall this movie is like every other stereotypical movie and has no originality. So this whole movie was never like the book it just took the name.",The DUFF
146,lime-green-190,had nothing to do with the book,2,14 March 2015,"The only thing they kept from the book was the names of the characters. As someone who had really enjoyed the book and was looking forward to the movie I was truly disappointed. Bianca doesn't actually try to change anything about herself, they made Toby turn out to be a jerk, Wesley is suppose to be a stuck up rich player whose parents are always traveling, Bianca lives with her father because her mom left them, and they randomly threw in a mean girl! Also why is the mean girls' (Madison?) friend EVERYWHERE? In the mall I get, but running through the woods in Bianca's secret hiding place at the same time she and Wesley are there? Bit of a stretch, and who has time follow people around all day filming them?! Just some of the main differences I saw and had trouble getting past. And if you're making a movie about an ""ugly fat friend"" maybe get someone who is actually ugly or fat.",The DUFF
147,lizlikespie,Unrealistically Real,7,18 March 2015,"Let me take you on a journey, my friends. It was a quaint and salty day, and I was on my journey to take a wild gander and view Eggsbenedict Cucumber in 'The Imitation Game.' Unfortunately, as I made my way to the local TheAter tollbooth, I was preceded by a long premonition that I would be stripped of this cinematic experience like Lindsay Lohan was stripped of her sweet sweet innocence in 'Mean Girls', seeing as it was sold out. I reckon, this is the time when I was forced to watch this slightly more mediocre edition of Mean Girls. Like, if Mean Girls was a movie with everyone being the Mean Girls, yet no one being the Mean Girls except for that one constant Mean Girl. I speculate that we will all find deep in our hearts, that maybe, just maybe, Bianca herself, was the Mean Girl, that we are all the Mean Girl, but at the exact same time, none of us are the Mean Girls, and we must come together and we should ALL JUST TOTALLY STAB CEASAR. Because, well, after all, Bianca doesn't even go here. With that in mind, I give Mean Girls a 10 out of 10. This other one was okay I guess. I mean, I did fall asleep half way into it so like, 7??",The DUFF
148,lucykillick,Good but a lot like 'Easy A',7,11 April 2015,"Easy A is one of my favourite films so maybe that's why I could spot the similarities; the blue devils, the misleading main character at the beginning, the filming technique when the video is being passed around the school, the main character narrating and the overall humourNonetheless, I thought The Duff was a great, easy going film. I can't say I laughed out loud but it was entertaining and I like the overall message too. Bella Thorne was brilliant in this - I've just watched her in 'Blended' and couldn't believe it was the same person. Mae Whitman performance was believable and natural, I don't think she is really a 'duff' though! I think this will be very successful and it's just what you need for a light-hearted, uplifting film.",The DUFF
149,asbyvoet-99345,So funny with a different point of view!,9,12 June 2015,"I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't watched it so I'll just stick to the outlines.. Now, I'm not usually someone that laughs out loud at movies unless they are really funny. In this case, it was really funny. The jokes are good and so are the absolute fails some people just have to suffer to get through things. Another thing I found particularly good was that it wasn't some typical preppy, gorgeous (not that she isn't pretty) high school cheerleader. It was a real person facing real struggles.. I really suggest you watch it! I'm definitely going to watch it again, especially if I'm feeling a little down myself, it would be the perfect pick-me-up..",The DUFF
150,mikeaustin-26357,Cliché,6,22 June 2015,"The Just: What starts as an original fresh concept somehow makes its way into an overplayed high school dance cliché. Nonetheless, not terrible, and provides 2 hours of entertainment which if you follow my reviews automatically gets a 5, and the comic relief takes it to a 6. Although there are better movies out there, which warrant much higher scores from me, this movie provides a relative safeness in the choice, you are getting a flick that you don't have to think about, dread over, or stress over, and end satisfied. This joins along list of features in this genre warranting a '6', however if you are looking for more within the genre, features such as; Superbad and American pie put this movie to shame however you look at it. .",The DUFF
151,kk_cabarle,A fast-paced sweetly and humorously packed film!,9,7 July 2015,"I don't really get my hopes high when I watch teen flicks. Yeah, I - we, always get the cliché plot where there's the geek MC with super low self-esteem getting the super cool and bad-ass jock of their school. Or this super fab chic and her teeny-weeny realizations in life making and pushing her to make a 2.0 version of herself. Well, moving on. I couldn't say the movie plot of The DUFF is way way different from all of the things I've mentioned above. Yes, the plot did qualified in the cliché-teen-flick-movie street, but the execution on the other hand I must say gave this movie an edge.Again, plot-wise it's not that new. But the fast-paced and well execution of the characters I must say, was very well done! (High-five to the casting people of this film!) Putting in some of my personal thoughts in this film: I didn't get bored at all. I was actually very well entertained. There was a perfect blend of teenage drama with a pinch of humor (I really liked the MC's sarcasm haha!), bad-ass teachers, sh*tty-fab queen attitude probs and a whole lot more. The story after all didn't feel strained for teenagers, it was just right - cute, fun-quirky film to watch when you're just bored at home or in a pajama party with your gang.Overall, I'll give this a 9 out of 10! Totally going on my A+ teen flicks list and I'm definitely watching this again (don't judge lol, we all do have our own teen-flick cravings)!",The DUFF
152,siafanfan,Really good movie I liked it a lot. I recommend it to everyone especially to teenagers!,10,18 October 2015,"I watched this movie last night. I didn't expect something good and then I was fascinated with it. Beginning was amazing,I didn't knew that it was based on novel. WARNING REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS IF YOU DIDN'T WATCHED MOVIE YET DON'T READ REVIEW!!!Bianca was The Duff (the designated ugly fat friend) for me she was really beautiful (Mae Whitman) she played her role really really good. She was funny and good person. She didn't released that she is duff. Movie was really fascinating I liked it a lot,all roles were good played and believable. I think that teenagers should watch it. I liked some quotes from movie like: ""no matter what label is thrown your way, only you can define yourself"" that's a really smart and beautiful quote also another quote from movie ""You're Only as Awesome as You Think You Are"" was good.This movie deserves higher IMDb ratings,I think it's little bit underrated it had good impression on me but at least 8 out of 10 it deserves.Bianca was lucky that she had that good friends. I liked Wesley role ( Robbie Amell ) he portrayed it good and he and Bianca were really sweet couple. This is exactly new generation of teen comedy which I liked it was really funny I laughed so hard,some scenes were so so funny.The ending was flawless,it was amazing and lovely. And I just need to find somewhere but I don't know where the text Bianca wrote about what prom means to her.",The DUFF
153,mtstuntin,Great watch,7,2 December 2015,"The film that I will be reviewing is The DUFF. A brief synopsis of the movie is, Frumpy high-school senior Bianca (Mae Whitman) has a rude awakening when she learns that her classmates secretly know her as the DUFF -- designated ugly fat friend -- to her prettier and more popular pals. Desperate to reinvent herself, Bianca enlists the aid of Wesley (Robbie Amell), a charming jock. In order to save her senior year from becoming a complete disaster, Bianca must find the confidence to overthrow a judgmental student (Bella Thorne) and revolutionize the school's social order. This film has been well received by critics. Writer for the Roger Ebert website reviewed this film and gave it three out of four stars. I thought that the execution of this film was done immensely well. The director relied and played off of each actor's strongest suit. The actors are required to deliver witty, crude, one-liners and I think that they pull it off amazingly. The movie is riddle with dark humor and inappropriate jokes. The likes of which would fall flat without the comedic timing of the main characters. Another extremely important aspect of films is a coherent storyline. The storyline in this is not one that is complex, but it is clear and concise. The audience is seemingly able to follow the plot line and understand how each character ends up in a certain predicament. Character development is also essential in story telling. This film does an excellent job of creating well-rounded characters. The audience is able to understand what motivates each character and the reason behind their actions.",The DUFF
154,schains-39077,"The usual, typical, and cliché teen flick but the character is worth watching.",6,15 March 2016,"No doubt the plot was more or less the same story of a not hot girl (a DUFF in 2015) try to change herself then lose her friend but finally discover that this isn't herself and end up with the guy who she did not target in the first place. You can figure all this out from the first 5 minutes of the movie.However, the real charm and entertaining is within the 2 main character Bianca and Wesly (the only two character that actually have a role). Bianca was awkwardly funny and smart while Wesly was cheeky, idiot and cutest. Together they are amusing, charming, and realistic probably one of the best couple in my list right now. I think what really attract people to the movies was the insider that it is damn true about a DUFF (apparently I am one). It is another entertaining teen flick movie but just don't expect anything new from it then you will ended the movie with pleasure and a little blush.",The DUFF
155,kami-41766,Cute Movie,5,8 May 2016,"The term Duff - I have never heard of that term. Maybe it exists in society or maybe it was something that Hollywood made up. I'm not positive on that.So The Duff translates to (Designated Ugly Fat Friend). Which is the friend that is less attractive than the others in that particular CLICK. It touches on some very real LIFE facts hidden in the story. CYBER Bullying, Social Media, Clicks, Stereotyping, Awkwardness and just the meanness of high school in general.I felt like this movie was a cross between She's All That and Easy A. It was cute and funny. But it was very predictable.Mae Whitman was a great choice for THE DUFF. She is great with one liners and usually plays the girl that is a bit odd, different or just does her own thing. And she always plays it well.And of course this movie has Robbie Amell who is very nice to look at. I think a lot of teenage girls would really like this movie.",The DUFF
156,lianagrigoran,Typical teen movie,8,11 August 2016,"The DUFF is a typical teen movie! If you are looking for a funny and easy movie to watch it with your friends, The DUFF will be a good choice! It is about an ""ugly"" girl Bianca (of course she is not really ugly) who finds out that she is a DUFF (Designated Ugly Fat Friend). So the easiest person to talk with, if someone needs information about her more beautiful friends. Her neighbor, the handsome and popular Wesley, helps her to become as pretty as her friends. SPOILER Like in every teen movie the boy sees the real beauty of the girl and they fall in love with each other. In between there are some romantic, funny and also serious scenes.All in all I really liked the movie, because we need sometimes a romantic movie to show that everyone is beautiful in their own way.",The DUFF
