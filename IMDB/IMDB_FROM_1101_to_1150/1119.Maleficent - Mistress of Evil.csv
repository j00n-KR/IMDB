0,Leofwine_draca,"Soulless, and then some",2,4 October 2020,"MISTRESS OF EVIL is the sequel to MALEFICENT that didn't need making. It's an ultra-generic movie which might just be the most soulless that Disney has ever put its name to. The characters barely feature and even in dialogue scenes the background is awash with distracting, fake-looking soft CGI artwork. If you thought George Lucas overdid the CGI in his STAR WARS prequels, wait until you get a load of this! Things move onward with typecast villainry, cheesy romance and the stockest of stock battles at the climax, and apart from the incredible, unending overload of CGI, there's nothing here at all. Nada.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
1,SnoopyStyle,standard uninspired sequel,6,8 January 2020,"Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) had installed Aurora (Elle Fanning) as the queen of the fairy land of Moors. Prince Philip proposes to Aurora. Their marriage would unite the Moors with the human Kingdom of Ulstead. Maleficent is once again feared as the story of her evil curse spreads. Unbeknownst to them, Queen Ingrith (Michelle Pfeiffer) is working to wipe out the fairies and conquer the Moors.It follows the rules of sequels by having a bigger war and diving deeper into the protagonist's origins. It's rather standard and uninspired. Non of the Dark Faes stand out. There is a mechanical quality to the writing and sometimes, it misses some good opportunities. It would be better to have a smaller ending with Maleficent saving Aurora and the fairies. It doesn't need a war. It would be a better and simpler conclusion.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
2,claudio_carvalho,Treachery,6,5 January 2020,"In Moors, Prince Philip (Harris Dickinson) proposes Aurora (Elle Fanning) to get married with him. However his mother Queen Ingrith (Michelle Pfeiffer) invites Aurora and her grandmother Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) to have dinner with her and King John (Robert Lindsay) in her castle in Ulstead. Aurora and Maleficent go with the crow Diaval (Sam Riley) is the human form. During the dinner, Ingrith provokes Maleficent and King John is cursed and sleeps. Aurora blames Maleficent and she flies back to Moors. She is hit by an iron bullet and falls into the river. She is rescued by Conall (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and learns there is a species in Moor just like her. Meanwhile Queen Ingrith uses Maleficent's curse to declare war to Moors.""Maleficent: Mistress of Evil"" is a film by Disney not bad as indicated in some reviews. The story is entertaining for fans of fantasy and adventure genres and supported by great special effects. If the viewer watches with lower expectations, ""Maleficent: Mistress of Evil"" may be a good option. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Malévola: Dona do Mal"" (""Maleficent: Owner of the Evil"")",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
3,nogodnomasters,Guess who's coming to dinner?,8,7 November 2019,"Queen Aurora (Elle Fanning) agrees to marry the Prince (Harris Dickinson). It is quickly known Michelle Pfeiffer is the bad person who disrupts everything and wants war.There is a lot of killing and action. Little fairies die, although they just turn to dust, no horrible agonizing scenes. We get a back story of Maleficent's kind. And what Sleeping Beauty fairy tale would be complete without a dragon? Has the emotion and intensity for an older audience who like fairies.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
4,paul_haakonsen,As good as the first movie...,7,6 January 2020,"I enjoyed the 2014 ""Maleficent"" movie about as much as I enjoyed this one.First of all, I must say that the story was actually slightly more interesting and appealing than the first movie. Why? Well, there was a more dark and sinister feel to this 2019 ""Maleficent: Mistress of Evil"". I mean, even just the title itself has that feel to it.Being a Disney movie, after all, there is an abundance of sugar-sweet scenes as well. And while the creatures in the movie were mostly of interesting design, some of the scenes were just overflowing with that particular Disney magic. But hey, not really a hindrance to the movie, because it does help to set that magical and mystical realm of the faeries feel that the movie needs.The characters in the movie were good, and I love the evolution of Maleficent and the insight we are given into the character and her heritage.Visually, then ""Maleficent: Mistress of Evil"" is just downright spectacular. The special effects are simply amazing and dazzling. I love the attention to detail throughout the course of the movie. And the CGI team really worked their magic to top notch quality.They had a good selection of actors and actresses for the movie. And needless to say that Angelina Jolie is simply so right for the role of Maleficent. Michelle Pfeiffer was also quite nicely cast for her particular role and she performed rather well. I really liked the role of Diaval - as portrayed by Sam Riley. Just a shame that he didn't have a bigger role and part in the movie.""Maleficent: Mistress of Evil"" is definitely well-worth sitting down to watch, and it is suitable for most members in the audience.My rating of this movie is a seven out of ten stars.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
5,studioAT,Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,3,11 June 2021,"The original film probably didn't need a sequel in the first place, and while this is a decent enough second helping, it is a muddled one.I imagine they should stop now.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
6,CinemaSerf,Not a patch on the original....,6,24 November 2019,"In the best tradition of Disney, this film has a rousing score and looks stunning; but just like the recent rehash of ""the Lion King"" is entirely an example of style over substance. Maleficent is meant to be evil - like Venger from ""Dungeons and Dragons"". Instead we get a sugary, goody-goody with all the venom of a water snake. Robert Lindsay, Chiwitel Ejiofor and Harris Dickinson fail to make any impression at all leaving Michelle Pfeiffer to reprise her role from ""Stardust"" and try to salvage something - anything - from a very weak storyline. It seems uncertain as to whom this film is actually for - but if it is meant to be for children, then it has no business being two hours long.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
7,Calicodreamin,Absolutely Fantastic,9,21 October 2019,"A really beautiful movie. The cinematography and cgi were incredible, the acting was good, and the plot was interesting. The storyline flowed well and was a proper follow up to the first Maleficent. Honestly there were a few times where I was teared up, the scenes with aurora and Maleficent were so well done. There is an unmistakable chemistry between Jolie and Fanning and it is exploited so well by this movie. It was a really lovely experience.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
8,oscaralbert,Most if not all viewers of this flick will be wondering desperately . . .,9,21 October 2019,". . . how MALEFICENT: MISTRESS OF EVIL lines up with our Real Life Current Events. MALEFICENT is like an upside-down cake, with every ingredient meant to be consumed the opposite way. A fife player named ""Mickey"" is Queen of the Ulcers, fighting the title character (actually, the jolly angel commander, despite her sobriquet). The Ulcers proclaim themselves ""holier-than-thou,"" erecting huge ""Houses of Worship""--which turn out to be used primarily to torture the young, innocent, and defenseless. Surely this constitutes what the movie business refers to as a ""dead giveaway"" that these villains represent the USA's Pachyderm Perdition Party, and their cult of perverse Roman henchmen. Despite having taken an oath to support their Constitutional Head of State, EVERY Ulcer in uniform proves to be a Pachyderm at heart, just as in our Real Life USA Homeland. These automaton-like overpaid drones follow the actual Evil Witch here--Mickey--swallowing her ""All lies, all-the-time"" agenda Crook, Slime, and Stinker. Mickey's ""core supporters"" cannot be persuaded to defect from her ""base,"" even after she reveals herself to be a wicked goat. MALEFICENT's message is similar to that of another current release (JOKER): Each and every creature of the elephantine persuasion MUST be eradicated, for these Corrupt Corporate Communist Capitalist One Per Centers and their legion of supporters/enablers/fans are demonically possessed, not-to-be-trusted, beyond Redemption, and totally unworthy of space on this planet!",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
9,view_and_review,Game of Thrones Anyone,5,18 November 2019,"This Disney version of Game of Thrones pitted two alpha females against each other. In one corner was Daenerys Targaryen also known as Maleficent. She didn't have a dragon but she had her own wings so there. She didn't breathe fire but she could throw green fireballs which had the same effect.In the other corner was Cersei Lannister otherwise known as Queen Ingrith (Michelle Pfeiffer). She was married to a weak man that she had to do away with so that she could rule how she saw fit. She was malicious, conniving, and boss. She was more maleficent than Maleficent.Their mega-battle and its preparation was occasionally interrupted by Aurora and prince what's-his-face's relationship. They were truly in love and were to wed and join two races of beings in harmony. It was some real fairytale stuff. Really, it was just like every other kids animation movie involving humans and other creatures (Shrek, Smallfoot, Monsters v. Aliens, etc.). The two species/races dislike each other because they don't know/understand each other. Through a sacrifice by one or both of the species they will learn to live together.Maleficent was no different except that they made it Game of Thrones-ish complete with British accents. Just so Disney could say it was their own creation they threw in a princess marrying Prince Charming. I just hope they don't make a third part.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
10,neil-476,Eyecatching fantasy fun,8,20 October 2019,"Aurora, Maleficent's victim in the original Disney animated feature, but much-loved adopted daughter in the more recent live-action ""everything you always thought you knew wasn't quite true re-imagining"", is about to get hitched to Prince Philip. Maleficent isn't entirely happy: on the other hand, Philip's mother, Queen Ingrith is absolutely delighted. Her superficial conventional delight hides a darker delight, for she intends to engineer a mass slaughter and war with faeriekind. Maleficent is wounded, and ends up at the secret enclave of the Dark Fae, her own kind - winged, horned faeries. And they have two dominant individuals: a peacemaker, and one who is as keen on war as Ingrith.Angelina Jolie, Elle Fanning and Sam Riley reprise their roles from last time while Michelle Pfeiffer has a ball chewing the sceneray as Ingrith. The lovely visuals distract from the less interesting expository first half, but the final third is exciting and beautifully realised.And, for what is essentially a special effects beat-'em-up, it is often surprisingly emotional.I enjoyed it quite a lot.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
11,phd_travel,Why a war movie? Not the movie I expected.,5,17 October 2019,This was a war movie with a bit of a wedding. A war between fairies and humans. What happened to the magic of the first one? The story isn't suitable for kids. Lots of fighting for a Disney movie. I didn't want that kind of thing. Felt like I was watching Troy or some thing like that. It's great to see Angelina and Elle and now Michelle Pfeiffer as the evil queen - a human. Strange casting of the prince - too common looking. The visuals and sets are grand and colorful.,Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
12,JamesHitchcock,Fairy-Tale about Genocidal Warfare,4,15 October 2020,"In recent years Disney have been remaking some of their classic cartoons as live-action pictures. Some of these, such as ""Cinderella"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"", have been very close, both in tone and in storyline, to the original cartoons, but ""Maleficent"" from 2014 is very different, tying in with another recent trend, that of making dark, adult versions of traditional fairy tales, often influenced by Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Examples include ""Snow White and the Huntsman"", the Amanda Seyfrid ""Little Red Riding Hood"" and ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"". ""Maleficent"" is a retelling of the tale of ""Sleeping Beauty"" from the point of view of the Evil Fairy, who here becomes not so much Evil as a Morally Ambiguous Fairy.Despite its title, ""Maleficent: Mistress of Evil"" seeks to complete Maleficent's rehabilitation, allowing her to claim her place among the Good Fairies. ""Mistress of Evil"" is how her enemies see her, not how the film presents her. Maleficent's god-daughter Aurora is now Queen of the Moors and has finally decided to marry the rather wet-behind- the-ears Prince Philip, even though his kiss signally failed to wake her from her enchanted sleep, leaving Maleficent to perform the task. Someone at Disney, however, obviously decided that same-sex weddings have no place in fairy tales, so Philip it had to be.Love does not, however, lead to unalloyed bliss for Aurora. She finds that she is marrying straight into a dysfunctional family. Philip's father John is just as wet-behind-the-ears as his son, but his mother Ingrith is the mother-in-law from hell. Behind a thin veneer of icy civility, she is planning not just war against The Moors but also genocide against its fairy folk and other inhabitants, for whom she has an unreasoning hatred. It falls to Aurora, Philip and Maleficent to foil her plans. Maleficent turns out to be a ""Dark Fay"", a race of human-sized fairies with bat-like wings and corkscrew horns. The existence of this race was not mentioned in the earlier film, and even Maleficent seems surprised to discover that there are other beings like her in the world.Genocidal warfare is not normally regarded as the stuff of fairy tales, at least not of fairy tales intended for a family audience. (I am well aware that Grimm's tales, in their original form, contained a good deal of sex and violence, but these had to be bowdlerised before they could be regarded as entertainment fit for children). I certainly would not let children see ""Mistress of Evil"", which they would probably find even more frightening and upsetting than something like ""Snow White and the Huntsman"".The film does have its good points. The visual effects and the Tolkien-inspired quasi-mediaeval sets and scenery are impressive. Elle Fanning as Aurora is as dull as she was in the previous film, and Harris Dickinson as Philip is no better, but Angelina Jolie and Michelle Pfeiffer are good as the two adversaries Maleficent and Ingrith, even if those of us who fell in love with the lovely Michelle in the eighties and nineties will have difficulties accepting her as a villainess.Overall, however, this was not a film I enjoyed. Fairy tales, almost by definition, don't have sequels, unless you want to make a film about ""happily ever after"", a subject which does not allow for much in the way of dramatic conflict or plot development. Trying to make a sequel to ""Sleeping Beauty"", even a retold ""Sleeping Beauty"" was always going to be a difficult enterprise, and the plot of this one is often confusing and difficult to follow. The tone of the film also seems to veer alarmingly between ""innocent children's story"" and ""grim drama about a murderous dictator"", sometimes stopping at ""sub-Tolkienesque fantasy"" along the way. I said I wouldn't take children to see it. Actually, I don't think I would take adults to see it either. 4/10",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
13,thesar-2,The Much Lessor Princess Bride,4,16 May 2020,"There are so many elements of a movie, one should hardly focus on just one to base an entire opinion on. But, I did say hardly.What sets this way below the first Maleficent is the script. Boy, I just did NOT like the writing at all. Mercifully, Maleficent, herself, has some charming one-liners, but ALL other jokes but maybe two fell pretty flat. As were the special effects.Some FX worked, namely the lush backgrounds and, of course, the star, but a ton were either comically unreal or flat-out creepy like those three bickering fairies. To be fair, they weren't just creepy; they were annoying as all hell.Half the time this convoluted story feels like a kiddie story, much like original animated movie and then there's the other half was so full of hate, murder, slaughter and so many beings dying, it would be a tough Kill Count.I really enjoyed the first one, especially with Angelina Jolie as the title character and I implore you, while there's some good here, namely, again, the main character Maleficent, just stick with either Disney's original Sleeping Beauty and 2014's Maleficent, or just the Sleeping Beauty animated movie. There's almost zero reason to watch this No-One-Asked-For sequel.***Final thoughts: Generally, I try and do a synopsis in the body and typically 2-3 paragraphs down. This time I didn't. Frankly it's late and it would require a lot of thought to put back together the pieces of this mess into a quick plot summary. I guess one could sum it up with: Three groups fight over peace, fight literally at war and then fight amongst themselves for both. Did I mention there was a Princess Bride? Okay, not THEE Princess Bride. That's a much better story.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
14,cherold,A bad sequel to a brilliant movie; just keeps getting worse and worse,4,8 January 2020,"I loved the underrated Maleficent; I gave it the full 10 stars. So in spite of negative critical reviews I just had to watch this sequel (which has almost the same rating on IMDB as the original).The movie starts out okay. It's visually striking, with great effects and adorable creatures. Angela Jolie is still terrific as Maleficent. The basic premise of a wedding between the adorable Aurora and her prince seems perfectly fine.But almost at once things get uncomfortable. It feels like the movie is trying to build a conflict without putting enough work into the infrastructure, which makes things feel forced. Characters have unlikely reactions (notably, early on, Aurora).Then there's this whole construction of an origin-explanation for Maleficent that is okay but feels, like everything else, artificial and non-organic.Then there's some big action, which lacks emotional heft because nothing before it built real feeling into the plot, and finally there's a long section where everyone's reactions don't make much sense and where people seem to know what's going on even though, in a world without phones and social media, there should be nothing but confusion and chaos.And then there's some kids with wings smilling, because of course that's what the damn thing is going to leave us with.I don't know how such a terrible script got produced. Could no one on the project recognize how thoroughly terrible this was, and acknowledge that it KEPT GETTING WORSE as it progressed?I'm seriously attempted to write a long list of every senseless action in this movie, but it would take a long time and this movie doesn't deserve that much effort.I'm tempted to give this a 3, but in honor of the solid acting and special effects I'll make it 4. Seriously though, don't watch this.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
15,FeastMode,so disappointing and... lame,3,24 October 2019,"Here is what i loved about the first one. 1) maleficent, 2) maleficent, 3) maleficent, 4) the story, 5) the cool (action-ish) scene, 6) maleficent, 7) the music, 8) the darkness, 9) the villain, 10) aurora, 11) maleficent.so how do you think i feel about the sequel knowing maleficent isn't in it for about half of the movie, maybe more. there was an hour long segment of the movie where she was rarely on the screen, an hour that bleeds into the final battle scene. why?there was a decent amount of good in this movie. maleficent is awesome as usual. and funny. her and dieval are awesome together. the setup was decent. i was enjoying it for a while. then it seemed to fall off a cliff. i didn't even really wanna finish it by the end. it just lost me.i also thought so much in this movie is a ripoff of GoT. like a LOT. characters and entire scenes. they were still well made scenes, but not a great idea reminding us of the destruction of a great show (1 viewing 10/21/19)",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
16,Lejink,Mal's Well That Ends Well,8,31 October 2021,"My wife and I wanted to watch a Halloween themed film and so we opted for this sequel to the original ""Maleficent"", which we'd both enjoyed. I have to say we lapped this up too. Yes, it was very much more of the same, the old once-upon-a-time good versus evil, dark versus light, love versus hate struggles played out in a magical mystical land, but we were both swept up in this action-packed, highly colourful SFX extravaganza.Where the first film was immersed in the dark, however, this one is definitely played out in the light. Aurora, the young sleeping beauty from the first movie, has grown up under Maleficent's care in the enchanted forest where she lives with the fairy creatures, to be a pretty rosy-cheeked young woman who has captured the heart of the equally fresh-faced young prince who lives in magnificent splendour in the castle over the water.When they announce their engagement, it seems the time is right for a rapprochement between the two divided kingdoms as well as clearing the good name of the traduced Maleficent, but naturally there's another evil queen who's hatched a plan which will see the obliteration of all things magical.It's certainly sensory overload from first to last with epic depictions of said forest and castle and if the final extended battle-scene seems like C-Gen-Max, it had been well set up from what went before.Ms Jolie and her remarkable cheekbones glides effortlessly over all she surveys and the supporting cast join in wholeheartedly with her. Sure it's all over-the-top, but it certainly fitted our mood and entertained us from first to last.Happy Halloween everyone!",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
17,Bored_Dragon,"""What an awkward situation""",7,25 March 2020,"Although visually more diverse and impressive than the first, ""Maleficent: Mistress of Evil"" gives an impression of a film forcefully made just to milk some more money on the account of old glory. While the 2014 movie brings an original and interesting twist to the original story, the sequel is totally unoriginal and clichéd, at the same time a feast for the eyes and fasting for the brain. In addition, I resent it too much violence and death, which, in my opinion, makes it unsuitable for the youngest, who are Disney's target audience. I can't say it's bad, but I find it completely unnecessary, even superfluous, which is the case with most of the sequels to Disney films I've had the chance to watch.7/10",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
18,westsideschl,Formula Stereotyping,4,28 January 2020,"The first movie had some creative energy; this one was just unimaginative stereotyped characters & formula plot; as uncreative as a studio as can be, i.e. make a sequel using archived film & ideas all for money. Cute blonde princess acting like a cute blonde princess w/attractive male suitor, and lots of cute little fairy creatures against the tyrannical mother queen.

19,tabuno,A Solid and Commenable Sequel.,8,20 October 2019,This sequel to the 2014 fantasy original offers up a more emotional intense and mature movie that contains more malevolent violence as well as deeper feelings of betrayal as well as binding love. The basic elements of the original are retained including the glorious musical accompaniment but many of the details and characters seem quite different. The dramatic stakes are raised to a level almost too graphic for younger audience members while at the same time evolving along with the maturity level of those children who saw and remember the original movie. The end result is a solid and meaningful contribution to the 2014 original and nicely complements it without being a mere copy nor just more of the same.,Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

21,cruise01,"Stunning, exciting, and an epic fantasy adventure.",8,19 October 2019,"4 out of 5 stars.Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is a surprisingly surpassing sequel continuing the story of Maleficent and her goddaughter Aurora. I thought it was one of those rare better sequels which tops the first movie. The story is good. There is bigger action sequences with a fantastic battle with the Faye's and the humans. The direction is a little more epic than the original. It does have a predictable twist with a character coming out as a villain which is no shock or you can easily predict it from watching the movie trailer.The plot follows Aurora (Elle Fanning) who accepts Prince Phillip (Harris Dickinson) proposal. And to join kingdoms together. Phillip invites Aurora and her godmother Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) for a proposal dinner. Which Maleficent is not happy about Aurora falling for Phillip. During dinner, Maleficent and Phillips mother Ingrith (Michelle Pfeiffer) clashes with conflict about were they came from. Which causes Maleficent to lash out and escape the kingdom. While Ingrith is trying to wage war against Maleficent and the faye people who are living far away.The plot focuses on new themes such as Aurora falling in love. And Maleficent having trouble trying to accept that. With the idea of two kingdoms which Aurora is in love with the forest with the fairies. While Queen Ingrith is against the fairies. Believing the humans are being threatened by them. The story also explores new grounds which made the movie is when Maleficent discovers a place where there are plenty of Faye's like her around. It is really neat and cool. They are living in hiding from the humans cause they are a threat to them. When war rages on with the faye's trying to rescue the fairies and battle against the humans. The action sequences are amazing. The action and battle sequences are a little bigger in scale. The visual effects on the fairies may be a little iffy but the rest of the movie it looked fantastic.Angelina Jolie is good with the role. Elle Fanning, Sam Riley, and Harris Dickinson were good with the characters. Michelle Pfeiffer was also good as Queen Ingrith. New additions like Ed Skrein and Chiwetel Ejiofor are good playing the Faye's.The direction, cinematography, and music score are good and delivered the movie. There are some fantastic cinematography work with the aerial shots which made the film feel like a motion ride.Overall, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is a good fantasy adventure film. The cast did great. The direction, music score, and cinematography are good. The plot is a little predictable but it explores new ground with the Faye's storyline. The battle sequences are epic and exciting.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
22,pennyelenabooks,Good Enough,6,21 February 2020,"A better film than the first, as the story doesn't follow the princess and her well known story, but rather touches a new realm of storyline. The CGI were amazing and maleficent was enjoyable, being dorky and funny when she was trying to be more human, and a true mistress of power when she was challenged. The queen was pretty nice too, a true opponent to the leading lady. The romance could have been better.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
23,leonblackwood,An enjoyable movie for all ages! 6/10,6,21 February 2020,"Review:
Disney really has a way of pulling their audience into there emotional movies! I didn't think that I would enjoy this film, mainly because it just seemed like every other Disney fairytale, but I actually found it entertaining throughout. The CGI and amazing cinematography are what we have grown to expect from Disney, especially with all of there cash in the bank, but it was the various characters and the ""straight to the point"" storytelling that I enjoyed. I must admit, Elle Fanning (Aurora) did get on my nerves after a while, but Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) and her newfound fairies are brilliant. I know that a lot of moviegoers are not going to give this film the time of day because of it's ""fairytale"" type concept, but believe me, it's for all ages, and there is something for everyone. The epic battle scene towards the end was put together well, and the evil Michelle Pfeiffer (Queen Ingrith), was a great choice for her role. Pinto and the little fairy that gets kidnapped, are also a great addition to the cast, and the make-up, especially on Maleficent, and extravagant costumes deserve recognition for designers efforts. The colour palette, of enhanced greens and deep blacks, look great on the big screen, but it's hard to see the attention to detail during some of the battle scenes. At the end of the day, it does follow the typical Disney fairytale template, so we all know what to expect, but there are some unique moments that will make you happy for giving it a chance. Enjoyable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Joachim Ronning, who also brought you Bandidas starring Salma Hayek & Penelope Cruz, Max Manus: Man of War, Kon-Tiki and Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge. It's been rumoured that he will be directing the next Pirates of the Caribbean film, but I personally think that would be a bad idea because the last one wasn't that great. With such a big budget, and the Disney studio bang on his tail, I'm not surprised that Joachim spent a lot of time perfecting the CGI in this film, and I'm glad that he kept the storyline simple, which included showing were Maleficent originated from.Budget: $185million

24,TheMovieDiorama,Maleficent Mistress of Evil lethargically flies away to Pandora 2.0 tasking Aurora with the narrative heavy-lifting.,4,28 May 2020,"With the first feature tackling the events of the animated classic's plot from the perspective of the supposedly antagonistic Maleficent, one would've anticipated a closed ending so that Disney could move onto tarnishing their other intellectual properties. However, with so much dollar being made, an inevitably unnecessary sequel was bound to be commissioned. Enter ""Mistress of Evil"", a sub-title that applies to literally none of the characters whatsoever. After Aurora was crowned Queen of the Moors, the now re-casted Prince Phillip proposes to her and somehow invites her and Maleficent, without verbally communicating his desire to them, to an intimate dinner with his royal parents King John and Queen Ingrith. Maleficent begrudgingly attends only to be accused of witchcraft when King John mysteriously succumbs to the same curse that Aurora was plagued with years ago. The Queen rages war against all things fairy whilst an injured Maleficent is rescued by other Dark Feys, as her species plot a retaliation against the humans. Thus consequently bestowing a war across the kingdoms.Rønning, responsible for the latest forced instalment of the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise, unabashedly equips the same forced narrative pulling for this unnecessary sequel. The plot, stretched to nearly two hours, gradually subsides from weak character-driven fantasy to mighty generic world-building again, just to showcase the artificial digitised fauna and flora that Lickspittle (no, not my safe word...), a de-winged pixie forced to produce red powder through alchemy that disintegrates fairies, becomes fascinated with. Whilst the ambitious fantastical creations are admirable and aesthetically pleasing, it's shrouded in surface level purpose and distracts from the titular character. For example, a hedgehog-like creature named Pinto (who resembles Sonic pre-media-uprising-change) seemingly garners more screen time by being trapped in a glass bottle than Maleficent does in the film's entirety. Exaggeration? Maybe. But if the film is to be called ""Maleficent"", make her the central character.She seems tertiary in this sequel, with Jolie taking a mighty leap to the backseat position, leaving the other actors to carry the narrative without her impressively physical stance. Her penetrating cheek bones and chic costume design still exude elegance and power, yet her emotionality towards specific scenes was lacklustre to say the least. Whilst Maleficent is flying around the set of 'Avatar 2' with a guided tour, Fanning steps up to the plate and gives a much improved performance as Aurora. No longer is she the flat one-dimensional princess that allows her limitless beauty to perform the communication, but now a stupendously independent queen whom singlehandedly saved this sequel from being catastrophic. Pfeiffer as the supposedly antagonistic queen (because the ""Mistress of Evil"" is now in full protagonist mode) was delicious with her sinister self-righteous line delivery. Her thirst for power truly came through her wobbly British accent, despite the fact her plan shouldn't have worked considering the spindle from the original film was not cursed but instead Aurora, which also conveniently offered the princess convenient explanations as to whom inflicted the curse upon King John even though the curse had quite clearly dissipated after the eye-rolling maternal ""true love"" kiss moment from its predecessor. Which in turn allowed her to convince Prince Phillip that his mother is a murderous psychopath and instead subconsciously seek peace with the neighbouring kingdom. But, semantics.Anyway, all this talk of war between the Dark Fey and humans soon surmounts to a climactic third act that thoroughly wipes out half of the population. No kidding! Magical denizens are sprinkled with red crimson powder, returning them to their natural dead state. Dark Feys vaporise into nothingness when contacting the aforementioned powder. Humans tumbling to their deaths from lofty heights. Sacrifice, rebirth and peaceful happiness once again. But who cares? None of these characters had any substantial development or whimsical motivation, particularly the barrage of newly introduced individuals, consequently providing no allegiance to either the humans or Dark Feys. Just excessive visual splendour for that needless extravagant third act.Arguably entertaining, but borderline redundant. The same can be applied to the entirety of this sequel. Not necessarily the worst creation in Disney's live-action library, with some improvements sprinkled throughout, but certainly one that really didn't need to exist. A far cry from 'Sleeping Beauty' that should've just been called ""Aurora""...",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

26,southdavid,Aurora borealis? At this time of year? In this part of the country? Localized entirely within your kitchen?,5,22 October 2019,"Sometimes. The films I choose to see a the Cinema have more to do with what time they start, and fitting them around something that I do want to see, rather than any innate desire to see that particular film. Sometimes it works out, and I'm pleasantly surprised. Sometimes I sit through something and struggle to remember it 10 minutes later. ""Maleficent 2"" is one of the latter.Princess Aurora (Elle Fanning) agrees to marry Prince Phillip (recast from the original to Harris Dickinson). The King and Queen (Robert Lindsay and Michelle Pfeiffer) are delighted but insist on meeting Aurora's godmother before the wedding can progress. The dinner with Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) is a tense one, that descends into argument and later tragedy as the King is struck with a living sleep curse. Though Maleficent denies creating the curse, under the Queen's reign war escalates between the human kingdom and mystical world.I think I did see the first ""Maleficent"" though I can't remember a lot about it. I do remember that it retold the ""Sleeping Beauty"" story from another point of view, so it was inventive in that score, way more inventive than this one. This sequel is fine. There's nothing particularly wrong about it, the effects are decent, the performances are OK, the story is ... there. It's just that overall it doesn't seem to add up to anything particularly memorable or interesting. Its morality and themes about prejudice have been done a thousand times before.For a film about Maleficent, the title character didn't seem to be in the film very much and I found many of the supporting character ran from bland, to full on annoying. The final battle was pretty good but I'm not sure it made up for the lengthy and patchy build up.Didn't hate it but only because there's very little there to inspire emotion at all.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

But when Phillip's parents invite them to dinner things start to happen as Phillip's father dies unexpectedly. Could it be Phillip's cunning mother that is trying to destroy the moors and frame Maleficent as the bad guy.
The effects are great,the story is good and the acting is great. Shame the original actor didn't come back as Phillip as the new guy looks NOTHING like the original 2014 Prince Phillip at all and his missing something. As for Michelle Pfieffer I knew from the get go that she was the villian as she is always typecast as the villian with the seductive voice.

This is a sequel to the 2014 Maleficent, which is based on the Disney Sleeping Beauty story. Angelina is Maleficent, a supernatural creature that has raised a human, Elle, who has been living in the woods with the rest of the fairie folk. Now, Elle has been proposed to by the local prince, with plans to unite their two kingdoms by the marriage-humans & fairie folk-in peace and harmony but not everyone is on board with the plan. Michelle plays the Queen/mother of the groom/prince, who tells Elle that she will be living in their castle after the nuptials, but Angelina is not too happy with those arrangements. Chiwetel plays the leader of a group that are trying to avoid the humans-they are living in caves-but of course, he doesn't succeed in his wishes. It's a nice fairy tale-not too childish for adults-and it has lots of action and some twists.
It's rated ""PG"" for fantasy action/violence and some scary images and has a running time of 1 hour & 58 minutes.

32,alindsay-al,A Good Sequel,7,9 June 2020,"This film got added to Disney+ this week and I have now watched the sequel to Maleficent, Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Maleficent's Goddaughter Aurora becoming engaged to the Prince, which causes both of them to question where there loyalty lies.
Main Character
Angelina Jolie is back as Maleficent and it was like she was born to play this role. She visually owns the screen as the character and she mixes the humanity and evil side of her character really well. She doesn't do that much these days but this role is one of those that really fits her as an actress.
Supporting Characters
Michelle Pfeiffer plays the Queen in this film and she is great here, she owns her role as the snarky evil old hag and you just really don't like her. Her character isn't that unique but there is enough about her to make her interesting and she is a worthy adversary here. Elle Fanning plays Aurora here and I thought she did a good job, her character is pretty generic but her relationship with Maleficent is well done here and I actually found myself caring about there relationship. Ed Skrein, Chiwetel Ejiofor & Robert Lindsay also all do good jobs in there small roles here adding plenty to the film.
Story
The story here has plenty going on but really the highlight is Aurora & Maleficent's story. They feel similar and mirror each other well, you see there loyalties split here and you feel for both the characters as the film does a good job in making you care about there relationship here. But as mentioned there is more going on in this film, some of it isn't really fleshed out and feels like maybe it could have been left out here. Also no spoilers but this film has a very Disney ending, with a film with a titular character that is mostly seen as a villain it plays it really safe and refuses to take any risks.
Script
The script has some good moments to it, there are some chuckle worthy moments and some decent drama. But overall it isn't that great, there is some humour that doesn't quite work and some of the drama that doesn't hit mainly in the supporting plot lines.
Style
The style is mostly good here, the costume design is fantastic, it looks brilliant especially for Maleficent who really stands out. Some of the action scenes are good aswell and feel really large scale fitting this film. But the issue is that sometimes the CGI doesn't exactly hold up and this film has some scenes that are in darker lighting that are actually quite hard to follow.
Overall
Overall, this is a good sequel here that will be entertaining for families and adults alike. If you liked the first film then this film is worth a watch for sure and a decent sequel.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
33,kwenchow,Another big letdown! Too slow and too many boring conversation! The action also quite childish and not intense! Very disappointed!,1,3 January 2020,"This film start with a bunch of people try to capture the so called ""shroom"", a man escape from the attack of a ""Fey"", and he submit the shroom to a pixie in a castle to take his reward scene! As turnout, this film is about a queen ""Ingrith"" using a pixie's magic to strengthen her throne and eliminate the Fey race lead by Maleficent! Entire film quite slow! The conversation in the film also freaking bored! Barely laughable scene is, Diaval saying he is a raven, not a human to a guard! The action in the film also quite childish! Such as, using pumpkin as cannonball! LMFAO! Barely intense scene is, Ulstead kingdom's army fight with the Fey race at the end! This scene have explosion from the pumpkins, an ax chop at a fairy, shooting with arrow, door glass broken and balcony collapse! At the end, Ingrith shot Maleficent with a arrow, Maleficent disappear and turn into dust! Maleficent resurrect and turn into a giant bird! Ingrith push princess ""Aurora"" from the balcony, Maleficent eventually save her! Maleficent turn Ingrith into a goat! At the very end, Maleficent watching Aurora marry with prince ""Philip""!

36,r96sk,Wish it was greater,6,12 November 2020,"More sluggish than entertaining, for me anyway.I enjoyed the first film, but 'Maleficent: Mistress of Evil' is one I never really got into. The whole premise surrounding Angelina Jolie's character is uninteresting, not helped by a lack of serious rationale for why characters, other than Maleficent, are acting the way they are; namely Michelle Pfeiffer's Queen Ingrith. At best, it's lame motivation.Jolie remains the star, while Elle Fanning is solid enough. Pfeiffer isn't as enjoyable as she should be, mainly due to the aforementioned, but still produces a good display. Chiwetel Ejiofor is a terrific addition to the cast, but I can't honestly say I'll remember his performance here - which is a shame.Warwick Davis is, slightly, underused too. Also, how strange to see former professional footballer John Carew on the cast; albeit in a minor role. The effects are, pleasingly, an upgrade at least; they all look great.I hold no ill feelings towards this, I just wish it was greater.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

The Final BattleThe VERDICT:Sequels are hard to make worthwhile, but I feel Disney corrected the mistakes from the other live action and delivered a fantastic addition to the Maleficent world. Maleficent 2 accomplishes the storytelling aspect quite well, expanding upon its characters and adding darker elements that give this movie more bit and suspense. Throw in beautiful world building and I can only say I was further impressed by what they brought to the big screen. However, the movie did not unleash the full might of the magic spell they can, still suffering from predictability and containment to keep it kid friendly. A little more expansion on battles, characters, and even the twist and this movie would have been another top sequel of mine. Still, there is enough bang for buck to catch this in theaters, though I will exercise slight caution in taking children who scare easily, they might get spooked.My scores are:Adventure/Family/Fantasy: 8.5

41,rannynm,"Very Emotional and Fantastical Movie, Beautifully Executed",8,18 October 2019,"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is a very emotional and fantastical movie with a unique take on the classic fairytale of Sleeping Beauty. Since I saw the first live-action Maleficent movie and the original Disney's Sleeping Beauty, I was really eager to see how the second Maleficent would compare to those, and this sequel does them justice. I am glad that we get to know more about Maleficent, the ""villain"" of the story.This movie successfully switches between the happy and dark sides of the ongoing feud with the mythical creatures and the humans. Also, the amount of effort and detail that went into the art direction and special effects pays off to make the film even better. From the sets to the mysterious woodland creatures, everything is colorful, vibrant and beautifully detailed, which makes it feel like you are in another world.It is fun to see Angelina Jolie play Maleficent again because she provides the perfect balance of strength and sweetness. The movie also introduces us to many new characters, such as Prince Phillip's evil mother, Queen Ingrith, and the Dark Fey, a group of winged creatures similar to Maleficent.Maleficent: Mistress of Evil spends a lot of time on the execution of the Queen's plot to take down Maleficent and other magical creatures, but never really explains how the Queen is able to get the information she needs to fulfill her plan. Some parts of the plot needed to be developed more but seemed rushed to get to the epic battle scene. Also, because there is so much going on with the battle plot, there isn't really an opportunity to find out a lot more about Maleficent. The first film was all about Maleficent, which is what made it so great. In Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, her character is more on the sidelines up until the end.The moral of this movie is that anyone can be good or bad and not to judge a book by its cover, because villains can come in many different forms.The film has a lot of beautiful visuals and lighthearted magic, but there are also some very dark scenes. I rate this film 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 7 to 18, as well as adults.Reviewed by Jordan M., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

42,Kamurai25,"""The War That No One Ask You To Start""",8,20 September 2020,"Great watch, would watch again, and can recommend.This was a very impressive sequel to the original. I'm sure it had something to do with low expectations, ""What are they going to do to follow THAT....ohhhh"".It's probably the first time I've registered a large scale battle like this movie has since....I guess ""Infinity War"", but ""Lord of the Rings"" seems more apt as it is a fantasy movie as well.What's really odd is that this movie has too many story lines, but still manages to balance them acceptably. It also goes the extra mile to explore the angle of ""it doesn't matter how different we are, but what we do with our potential"" sort of thing. There are race traitors, and true examples of evil disregard for life. Michelle Pfieffer really owns her role as an evil queen, and sure they go into backstory to give a modicum of justification, but she gets into death in a very psychotic fashion, not to mention the page.While the most charming part of the movie is the most boring, unity and peace, it is amazing at the great lengths people will go to prevent such a thing, and that's really the movie that you're watching here: someone going to every length to be a hero, and just being a jerk instead.Well worth the watch, and I think most would enjoy even without having watched the first.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

Angelina Jolie became the star in a movie that continues to delight audiences through streaming and heavy rotation on tv. The sequel, which picks up years after the end of the movie, finds the title character discovering her roots and meets new foes and friends. The budget is a bit higher in this one, and so is the length and scope of the movie. Even though its rated PG, it might be too scary for toddlers and babies to enjoy.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
44,Foutainoflife,Why All The Hate??,7,6 January 2020,"Look, I don't really care about what everyone else thinks because I love this version of Maleficent. I like this all powerful, tip-toeing a fine line between good and evil version of the ever so misunderstood character she is portrayed to be in this take of the ultimate evil villain from Sleeping Beauty. I think it is brilliant way of retelling the story.People are complaining about the story but it isn't as bad as some folks are making it out to be in these overly harsh reviews. It runs a bit deeper than face value, giving Maleficent even more of a backstory and does a decent job of setting things up for a third film.The actors were well suited to their characters with my one complaint being Elle Fanning. I didn't care for her in the first film and she hasn't done anything that improved my opinion of her part as Aurora in this one. I'm not sure why I don't care for her portrayal but I just am not into her.The special effects are great and I can't see why anyone would be finding a lot of fault in the work put into them. I can understand why some folks felt it was boring at times but I just see it as further character building so it didn't bother me.So why did I give it only 7 stars?Well, it did seem to drag a bit. And while I mentioned that the character building didn't bother me, they could've moved it along a bit better. I can see how some kids would lose interest in it. I also felt like the queen could have been played up a bit more to even out the story better. Then there was the whole phoenix aspect. I get rising from the ashes but I wish we could've seen the dragon from Enchanted show up in this.I would still recommend it as a good watch.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

Being Aurora's godmother, Maleficent agrees to attend a meal at the castle of King John and Queen Ingrith. Unfortunately things don't go according to plan, and any hope of the two families joining together in a peaceful union appears out of the question.
The fim seems to have a lot of ideas, but no clear direction as to how to link them all together. There is an interesting side to Maleficent's past that we get to explore. We peek into where she come from; and discover that there are others who are exactly like her, that part I did enjoyed. However, the central theme about tolerance and acceptance of people from different cultures, left me slightly confused. Angelina Jolie does a fine job in the leading role, although she is much better in the first film. Michelle Pfiffer is also impressive as the mistress of evil? she clearly had fun acting out the role. Elena Fanning is good but her character is a bit bland.

They lost everything that made the first one different and unique in the way to treat a classic fairy tale movie and the result is just your run-of-the-mill sappy, predictable vanilla Disney formula.

54,RforFilm,"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is a boring, soulless formula that can turn it's audience into sleeping beauties",3,21 October 2019,"Today's movie marks the return of Angelina Jolie as Maleficent. For those that remember, Maleficent was the main villain in the animated Sleeping Beauty from Disney. Like a lot of people, I've always praised the green-skinned demon/fairy as one of my favorite Disney antagonists, due to her grace, elegance, and overall design. Some might wonder why not someone more modern like Gaston, Frollo or Ursula; someone that has more motivation and development. Part of it is a nostalgia factor. When I was a kid, I was both frightened and entranced by the horned villain. Something about her portrayal seemed commanding and serious while being an animated character.Of course, 2015's Maleficent tried to do what the Wicked musical did: by taking a black and white villain and showing her side of the story while proving she wasn't as bad people thought. I thought the live action version had potential, but was bogged by a script that was afraid to go too far with making her character bad and seemingly making all the wrong choices to the other characters. But it was still a big hit, and if a hit movie comes from Disney, then a sequel is immanent. So now we have Maleficent: Mistress of Evil.In the years since the events of the first movie, Maleficent (played by Angelina Jolie) is still an outcast from the kingdom as people think she's evil. But her goddaughter Aurora (played by Elle Fanning) knows the truth and has taken position as Queen of the Moors, the forest where all the magical creatures lie. The big day comes when Prince Phillip (played by Harris Dickinson) finally proposes marriage and she says yes. Aurora tells Maleficent and the news doesn't go well. Through persuasion, Maleficent agrees to come to Price Phillips kingdom to meet his parents.Aurora and Maleficent are introduced to Queen Ingrith (played by Michelle Pfeiffer) who already has a clear prejudice on magical creatures. The dinner goes awkward and gets worse when Ingrith announces that Aurora will be like a daughter to her. Maleficent is pushed to her limit and demands that Aurora leaves with her. She refused, Maleficent flies away, cursing her daughter, but also getting shot down with an iron pellet (iron is her weakness). While Aurora questions her choices in the queen's castle, Maleficent is rescued and brought to a land where more people of her kind exist and want revenge on the human world.I already disliked the first Maleficent, so I had low expectations coming in. Unfortunately, the movie still seems to be misguided all over. Maleficent: Mistress of Evil certainly had a chance to do more of it's own thing. It just so happens that the same themes are present about how prejudice is bad and how humans in this world suck. So we already feel like were watching the first movie again.Unlike the first where you got a sense the actors were trying, it seems like everyone is giving a similar dull performance. Angelina Jolie is dull, Elle Fanning is dull and even Michelle Pfeiffer is dull. I'm not sure if they were directed this way or if this was a contract-based obligated situation, but this only adds to the film's story problem; nothing really happens nor does anyone change. Oh sure, we do have a fair share of magical creatures, swordplay and even a third act war. But when you really think about it, it doesn't make any impact on the characters and how they view others. If the movie doesn't care how this does anything for Maleficent, then why should I.Because of this, the movie comes out as more boring then anything. Though the first Maleficent was boring as well, I at least remember a summary of it. I doubt that I could recite any quotes or scenes from Maleficent: Mistress of Evil save for it's production design. I think this is a movie that put most of the direction into how it looks rather then what's on the inside. It's a cinematic plastic doll. It looks manufactured and feels manufactured. I'm sure this may have some fans, but I wouldn't be surprised if kids would rather watch another Marvel movie or even Frozen for the ninetieth time.I'll give this three Maleficent dragons out of ten. As I said, the costumes, sets and effects still look nice, but without an engaging story or character, there's no reason to get on board. At best, this may have life in stores giving demonstrations for it's high definition quality. Otherwise, this is a sequel that can stay sleeping.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
55,eminkl,It's an exhausted and undernourished piece of whimsy,4,26 October 2019,"Another year, another film from Disney. While in many of my articles, this point is popular, it is worth repeating. The more the Disney company (yes, corporation) restructures its own jobs, the more it resembles printing its own money. Aside from cynicism, there are cases where filmmakers from Disney took liberties with their source material and tried to become innovative. The Jungle Book (2016) by Jon Favreau, the Pete's Dragon by David Lowery (2016) and the Maleficent by Robert Stromberg (2014) are good examples. For their art and narrative, the first two films received critical acclaim. They transcended their source material capably and were standing on their own feet. Maleficent's first received mixed reviews but has gained a more positive reputation since its publication. Over time, critical examinations have highlighted his feminist allegory of sexual abuse and his accusation in fairytales of stereotyping. This sequel, Maleficent: Evil's Mistress, sees Joachim Ronning (Kon-Tiki, 2012 and Caribbean Pirates: Dead Men Tell No Tales, 2017) replacing Stromberg's director. Most of the cast returns (apart from Brenton Thwaites, replaced by Beach Rats's Harris Dickinson, 2017), and so does Linda Woolverton, Disney's screenwriter. But with some new faces (including Michelle Pfeiffer, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Ed Skrein), is the sequel going to charm viewers as much as the original? Five years after the prequel, Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) lived as the protector of her people, the Moops Moors (not the Muslims who invaded Spain in the Middle Ages) in a time of peace. She undertakes an abrupt change when she becomes aware that Prince Phillip (Harris Dickinson) is offering the courtship to Aurora (Elle Fanning). Under the happy occasion, Prince Phillip's mother, Queen Ingrith (Michelle Pfeiffer), has an ulterior motive: she is planning to use the wedding to divide people and fairies, and to provoke a possible war. Maleficent and Aurora are tied to their own people by their loyalty, causing a rift between the two just as they are about to become a family. One thing I've found is that more adults have sneakily developed even the most lackluster live-action Disney movie. In contrast to the allegory of the original film, the biggest example is the incredible pantomime appearance by Keira Knightley in The Nutcracker and the Four Realms (2018). Her work is not only over - the-top, but borders on being overly sensual (remembering Japanese anime's villainess). The expected portrayal of The Sugar Plum Fairy is subverted refreshingly. Mistress is unable to hit the same creativity floor. It's sugarcoated but insubstantial, fun yet bland, and awesome in childhood. The outcome is a complete disappointment. People expect to see the title character regularly, but the appearances of Jolie are so sporadic that it removes a strong focus on who the lead character is, making it difficult for the viewer to care for. Mistress also resorts to making Maleficent in the climax a' deus ex machina ' machine that further illustrates how Jolie's abilities were misunderstood. The remaining cast is lost in the shuffle, despite their valiant efforts, and the actors struggle to provide their roles with much-needed life. Fanning struggles to make her character memorable while Pfeiffer is on cruise control, particularly in comparison with her role in Stardust (2007). Meanwhile, Ejiofor appears to be struggling to stay awake, and Skrein looks bored again playing an overeager antagonist. More positively, as Prince Phillip, Dickinson is a definite upgrade to Thwaites. Smaller roles also hit their marks by Warwick Davis and particularly Jenn Murray (with her Kabuki-esque movements), but the rest of the cast sinks into the CGI sludge. It is difficult to discern whether Mistress is dull because of her incomprehensible storytelling or because the direction makes it difficult to take care of anything on the screen that happens. Wonderfully, Woolverton's script and co-writers Noah Harpster and Micah Fitzerman-Blue are trying to explore new ideas. For example, to highlight war, oppressed cultures, and genocide, the feminist allegory is altered. The exam is too brief to make an impact, and the direction of Ronning is plodding and lacking the energy to move the story forward with pleasure. You are more likely to notice poor narrative choices if you encounter boredom. Who would schedule a wedding immediately after an overwhelming fight in the right mind without giving priority to treatment or consideration to the dead and wounded? A startling lack of oversight is absurd and off-putting. The lack of attention to detail represents the problems of the film. His plot is incoherent, particularly without basics such as who his main character is, and his direction is too flat to ignite performances and pacing. It's an exhausted and undernourished piece of whimsy that doesn't build on the original's concepts and unfulfilled potential.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

Maleficent & Aurora have different opinions when it comes to an upcoming marriage & this causes some complications between them.Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is an awesome film. Director Joachim Ronning has given us a movie, that is as entertaining as the original. The action set pieces are fantastic. The visual effects are amazing. The 3D is eye-popping. Angelina Jolie is spectacular as Maleficent. Elle Fanning is outstanding as Aurora. Harris Dickinson is superb as Prince Philip. Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent as Queen Ingrith.

For some strange reason Prince Philip was recasted, which I hated. The acting was great, the script and story not so much. The scenery and CGI was pretty great but other than that it wasn't good. Half the time I spent was trying to figure out what the plot was. It made no sense. I barely even tried to watch it after forty minutes. It was clearly going nowhere. I also hated how there was more than one Maleficent. And how she has wings that can't even disappear when she wants. They just seemed to get in the way a lot.

With all due respect, not one bit did it feel like Angelina was in only half of the movie. Her story and where it took place served the other half of the story brewing in another location where she wasn't. If you take the ride into the fairy tale setting, pretty much any critical reviews go out the window. The last part was very hard to believe 20 min before was a massacre and annihilation of the fairies. then all of the sudden they were smiling to each other and even Flirting Didn't make sense to me. Angelina Jolie was really the only entertaining part of the film for me. And she was barely even in it. The war part was the worst.I was sitting there as dark fairies and humans were being killed and I thought ""Wow this is getting serious!"" But then at the end everybody was like ""Screw all the dead! We have a wedding to attend"" The ending hurt me a little. Like why exactly would anyone hold a wedding right after a battle in which hundreds of people died?

60,Movie-Misfit,Wonderful Sequel!!,7,28 October 2019,"I was a big fan of the first Maleficent. I'm not a big fan of these Disney live remakes (although Jungle Book was amazing), but the Maleficent movies do bring a little something else.I was surprised to hear a sequel was in the works. Although I knew the first film was a big hit, I was really hoping they weren't going to ruin this as most Disney sequels tend to do...But I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised. While it just had a hint of Disney cheese sprinkled throughout, the film was actually very entertaining and enjoyable. The casting was great (as were the performances) and it was quite beautifully shot - albeit with a majority of CG enhanced sets and backgrounds.I find it strange that a character such as Maleficent was chosen as the titular character for a film to begin with, but both films have been so good that I would love to see a third to perhaps tie things up as a neat trilogy. Jolie is great as the winged witch with a heart and seems to be having a lot of fun in the role!",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
61,tm-sheehan,Don't Mess With These Fairies: Enchanting /Original,9,22 October 2019,"My Review: Maleficent: Mistress of Evil
My rating - 9/10
Fabulous production, Terrific Casting and at last! a new original story not a remake of a Disney beloved cartoon.An original screenplay by 3 very talented writers Linda Woolverton ( Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Alice in Wonderland and Maleficent) Micah Fitzerman -Blue and Noah Harpster (A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood and Transparent.
Skilfully directed by Joachim Romming of (Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Men Tell No Tales ,Kon Tiki and Marco Polo)Maleficent; Mistress of Evil is The Wizard of Oz , Lord of the Rings , and bits of all your favourite fantasy tales on a combination pizza of magic enchantment sprinkled with extra fairy dust .Our recent trip to the DreamWorks exhibition in Canberra makes me appreciate this movie even more after seeing the cgi models and absorbing the information I learnt about modern 21st Century animation . I have to say Maleficent Mistress of Evil excels anything I've seen on screen the combining of human actors with animated bodies like our 3 fairies Leslie Manville (Flittle) Imelda Staunton (Knotgrass) and Juno Temple (Thistletwit) are incredibly clever and their characters add to brighten up the dark bits in this movie.
My tests of a good fairy tale is its moral or message value and Maleficent: Mistress of Evil and if it manages to transport me to another word . Without giving any plot details away this film does both it surprised and delighted me with its message of always look closely for the true story behind the facade of truth and above all no matter what race creed colour or species human or fairy we should strive to live in harmony with each other.
Angelina Jolie isn't just Maleficent, she's magnificent such an intelligent actress who brings to this role not just a cold and vengeful Mistress of Evil worthy of any S&M fetish parlour but she also shows compassion and emotion when required and she looks fabulous, those exaggerated high cheek bones and wings are inspirational make up and costume triumphs as all the costume and set designs are in this film.Angelina and Michelle Pfeiffer as Queen Ingrith rule this movie together it's great to see Michelle Pfeiffer back in a major film.
Elle Fanning as Princess Aurora is delightful, nice to see an earthy feisty intelligent Fairytale Princess instead of Miss sweetness and light . Harris Dickinson as Prince Philip was ok a bit wooden for my liking and not charming enough but it's the women who reign supreme in this film . I just read Brenton Thwaites the original Prince Philip in Maleficent was offered the role but due to commitments had to turn it down.I thoroughly recommend Maleficent Mistress of Evil and can understand why it outdid Joker and Once Upon a Time In Hollywood at the Box office in its first week of release as it has huge box office appeal to a much wider audience.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

68,Azanspy,A decent sequel to an average predecessor.,6,5 January 2020,"I had mixed feelings about Maleficent in 2014. It was an average movie which broke out because of curiosity, Angelina Jolie and less female centric movies. Disneya made decent cash in that and they went for a sequel. I should say I'm pretty impressed with what they have done. Maleficent Mistress of Evil is a decent popcorn movie that you can watch with anyone. The visual effects is dazzling and that itself is worth watching. Angelina Jolie and Michelle Pfeiffer was so perfect and I longed for more of their combination scenes. Elle Fanning is so beautiful but she didn't give her best in acting department. Overall, I liked the movie and I think it's a one time watchable visual spectacular with two of the most famous actress ever in Hollywood. I like this world that the movie is showing but I don't think another sequel will be good and I don't think Disney will make another sequel as this one was not a big hit.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

The pace is fast, there are some good individual scenes, and the performances by Fanning and Jolie are good, but in terms of direction, this is an absolute mess. Truly, the movie doesn't have any strong takeaways by the end. The two things that made the first movie so enjoyable were the characters and the creative ideas. Maleficent was an ambiguous and multifaceted character, and her relationship with Aurora was very interesting. At the same time, it was a well done film about greed and creatively played with tropes and lore. This film doesn't have any ideas on its mind at all, with literally the only one being that peace is a good thing. The lack of ideas comes from a lack of characters. Maleficent is shockingly absent from much of the movie, and while Jolie is quite good, her character has no arc at all. The queen was bland and had no interesting motivation, just a generic power hungry evil person. Aurora and Phillip had nothing to do all movie. The plot doesn't have anything that isn't purely by the numbers, though it has some shocking tonal shifts. It got dark and aggressive in the grand final battle scene, showing effectively a genocide of the Moors people, but it didn't actually mean anything thematically and was washed out as water under the bridge in the new age of peace. I know they tossed a (bizarre) line in about how Maleficent was descended from phoenixes, but come on. Seriously?? Massive deus ex machina. It feels like a thrown together blockbuster with no consideration for creating a coherent work of art. Forget this one exists and embrace Maleficent for the wonderful piece it is. Sidenote: what a bizarre title for this movie. Even putting aside that Maleficent doesn't get to do much, the whole premise of these movies is that Maleficent isn't in fact evil at all, and clearly never plays an evil role here - the queen is the obvious evil person all movie.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

78,Magow-Intermean,Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil Review,10,19 October 2019,"Queen Aurora (Elle Fanning) is engaged to marry Prince Phillip (Harris Dickinson). When her godmother Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) loses her temper during dinner with his parents, King John (Robert Lindsay) and Queen Ingrith (Michelle Pfeiffer), a war threatens to tear their worlds apart.
Queen Aurora (Elle Fanning) is engaged to marry Prince Phillip (Harris Dickinson). When her godmother Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) loses her temper during dinner with his parents, King John (Robert Lindsay) and Queen Ingrith (Michelle Pfeiffer), a war threatens to tear their worlds apart.
The first Maleficent was a magnificently designed, too-densely plotted piece of fairy-tale revisionism, one that - just about - managed to redeem a character who cursed an infant. The good news is that this sequel has a better bad guy, Michelle Pfeiffer's Queen Ingrith, who gives us a gloriously hateable rival to balance Jolie's imperious anti-heroine. There's still a lot of work for a film that should really be for kids, but at least this builds to a genuinely epic conclusion.
First, however, we have to wade through some syrupy scenes. Aurora (Fanning) is now Queen of the Moors, the mistitled name of a mystical and mountainous fairyland, and she and Maleficent are concerned with the hunt for some kidnapped fairies. But when Prince Phillip (Dickinson, taking over from Brenton Thwaites) proposes, Aurora must bring her scary godmother to dinner with the in-laws: King John (Robert Lindsay) and Queen Ingrith. It goes, as you might expect, disastrously for the wary, defensive fairy.
Maleficent ends up wounded and rescued by other 'dark fae' like herself, a remnant colony led by Chiwetel Ejiofor's Conall and Ed Skrein's more warlike Borra. There are hints of a love triangle but no more than hints: this film is far too interested in the insipid Aurora's attempts to figure out who is behind the plot, something that the audience knows from minute one.
It's refreshing and a little radical to see two armies led by women over 30.
Incoming director Joachim Rønning ensures that it all looks gorgeous, and costume designer Ellen Mirojnick (The Greatest Showman) does stunning work for Jolie and Pfeiffer in particular, one in high-fashion slink and the other armoured in white and pearls. But once again the plot is over-stuffed; too many scenes focus on cutesy fairy folk, and the competing philosophies of the two dark fae men are not always distinct. It's sad because Maleficent herself is interesting, always at war with her own tendency to distrust, to attack, to lash out. In the same way that Frozen's Elsa chimed with little children struggling to control their feelings, this anti-heroine can be magnetic when she's given a chance to hold the screen.
The good news is that it all builds to a gigantic struggle for the future of both kingdoms, as Ingrith lays out a surprisingly familiar theory of government and Maleficent finds a point of balance between trust and safety. It's refreshing and a little radical to see two armies led by women over 30 (even Ingrith's chief hench-person is female), however magical their surroundings, and Rønning orchestrates the fight beautifully. Fanning even manages to occasionally find something useful for Aurora to do: no mean feat in a character essentially designed to be a simpering blank.But you still wish that the filmmakers would trust in their leading lady to hold the attention, and slow down a little bit in order to give her a few more character beats. Let Maleficent be Maleficent, and revel in her goth greatness.An improvement on the first film, in the end, and an encouraging rallying cry against fear and intolerance, but it's still far too busy and baroque to match its leading lady's elegance.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
79,Mike_Devine,Not even Jolie can reverse this curse,3,14 March 2020,"Disney struck gold with the 2014 Angelina Jolie-starring 'Maleficent,' which brought one of the Mouse House's most reviled villains to life in a live-action adaptation of what happens when a young girl pricks her finger on a needle. So it's only natural that a sequel would be warranted, right?Wrong. 'Maleficent: Mistress of Evil' is a generic, formulaic movie that really does not have much to offer to anyone. Sure, we get to see one of the greatest actresses of our generation (Jolie) back in action as the horned titular character. And yeah, the Disney magic is there in at least some capacity. But everything from the story to the cheap-looking CGI to the wooden acting and shoddy script brings the film down. Not even an overproduced performance from one Michelle Pfeiffer can salvage this car wreck.But perhaps the worst part about 'Evil' is it's boring. There's nothing in here that gives the audience anything to care about or root for, and everything just kind of happens like it's something being moved through a factory on a conveyor belt. Not fun, not funny, not fundamentally sound in its storytelling.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

82,fciocca,"A nicely done live action Disney remake, but pretty predictable story with the usual happy ending",5,26 October 2019,"When you are going to watch a movie like Maleficent you know already that you are going to see a production that from a technical perspective is amazing, but the story will be pretty flat and predictable. Even if the ending of the first movie was pretty standard, with a narrative structure that everyone is used to, I preferred it, compared to this one. I have to say that there was no other way to end it, if you wanted to have a definitive closure, but still, I was not impressed, and since first minutes, I already knew its ending, or at least I have imagined.Regarding CGI sequences (that are basically 95% of the movie), I don't have any complaint. Creatures are extremely realistic, landscapes are stunning, even better than the previous chapter and animation are amazing, cured in every single detail. They put a lot of effort (and especially money), to create this world.After briefly speaking about the special effects, let's speak about the acting. I do not even express a detailed opinion about Angelina Jolie: she gave to this character a lot of charisma, and it is for sure one of her best interpretation of the latest years.
Then we have Elle Fanning, the adoptive daughter of Maleficent, that, on the contrary, is pretty flat. The too forced English accent is really annoying. This time she was more present on the movie and she needed to be better. I understand that her innocent kind of face is well fitted on this ""fairy tale"" kind of movies, but acting should follow. In my opinion Disney made a better choice with Naomi Scott, she was physically perfect for the part, but at the same time she is also very expressive. Elle Fanning has some good moments, especially towards the ending, but for the rest of the movie I was unimpressed.
Michelle Pfeiffer plays the villain, and she was a well built character: she is very smart and she knows which strategies to use to destroy the magic creature world. Way much better than King Stefan in the first movie, that instead completely lost his mind. She is charismatic, and even if you know that she is the enemy, her character is fascinating.Maleficent: Mistress of Evil will make you pass two good hours, it is a perfect movie for families. i enjoyed it but for my personal scale value, I cannot give more than five stars to this production.

PG
Director: Joachim Ronning
starring: Angelina Jolie,Elle fanning,michellen pfeiffer,Harris Dickinson,Sam Riley,Chiwetal Ejiofer,Imelda Staunton,Warwick davies etcoverall rating 46/100Maleficent mistress of evil follows the story of Auroras ( Elle fanning) engagement to Phillip( harris dickinson)But when maleficent( angelina jolie) is introduced to phillips evil mother she is framed as the villain again. Maleficent must make some discoveries of her own and dethrone queen ingrid ( michelle pfeiffer)in order to make peace between the fairies and the humans. Maleficent mistress of evil for me was a massive let down and a big disappointment,it had its good moments but there was just to many problems with it that made it much worse then the first film.First of all though lets start off with the amazing visuals. if you don't think about most of the parts of the movie Maleficent 2 was beautiful to look at. The CGI from the first movie has definitely improved which was noticeable and appreciated. And there was more creative creature designs and great set locations. So the film definitely improved in that department which is unfortunately one of the few areas it has improved in.A part of the film where it has not improved on would be its creativity for its story. The first movie was a great twist to the story of maleficent. But this movie was generic and lacked any good storytelling that we haven't seen before. It just felt like a slightly flashier version of the first movie. With the whole concept of the parent stopping the main characters being happy and the conflict of good and evil with maleficent which we all knew she was good. So it was pointless the movie even trying to insinuate that she would be evil as i never at one point thought she would be.Next the film had really slow and dull pacing for a large majority of its screen time. There was a lot of just doing nothing in Maleficent 2. It just felt fairly uneventful and due to the lack of action which we will talk about the film really dragged for me and i couldn't help but get bored for large chunks of the movie. It was almost like they were trying to make it a more serious character driven movie which did not work despite its equally ridiculous and cheesy moments.Next i liked the interesting character dynamic of having maleficent discover people who are the same species as her. I thought this added interesting dynamic to the story,the final act and the character of maleficent. This was the part of the story where they actually tried to steer away from being generic which i appreciated and exploring a whole new part of that world was fun including the designs of some of the wings were great as well. It added a good dynamic to the final act as well so there was more of a fair and equal chance of the defeat of queen ingrid. But most importantly it added a bit more depth to her character. After years of feeling alone it finally gave Maleficent some freedom and the feeling of being part of something which was great. So this added a bit more character development to maleficent as well as the conflict of peace vs war was well executed as well.Next i have to say unfortunately for the actors i really did not like Aurora ( Elle Fanning) or Phillip ( Harris Dickinson) aside from there performances in general unfortunately only being sub par. There characters were extremely irratating. They were both given very cheesy scripts and it did not work for there characters. Phillip felt irrelevant for most of the film and Aurora just stood around not doing much and acting confused the whole time. And what annoyed me even more was that they focused the film more on these two despite them actually not doing all that much and the attention was taken off maleficent. Everyone is paying to see the lead character that is the title of the film. She was not in half of the movie which in my opinion was a terrible mistake as she felt to me like an afterthought to poorly fleshed out charecters that shouldn't of been used more.Next i have to add the two people that prettymuch kept this movie from being to much of a disaster. The performances of Angelina Jolie and Michelle Pfeiffer were fantastic. Angelina jolie is such a powerful force playing this role. You really cant imagine anyone else playing her. She really has made the character her own. Her acting was great she had fantastic one liners and bought a surprising but needed amount of sarcasm and humour to the movie. Next Michelle Pfeiffer was a fantastic villain here. She really was the epitome of evil within the film. Her performance was very campy which is the type of performance you need for this type of film. And her character was willing to anything to get what she wants and was incredibly manipulative. This includes killing her husband,son and daughter in law. However i thought that her character had a lack of depth or development in order to explain why she was doing all these horrible things. It was lightly talked about but the reasoning was not good or justified enough for it to be believable which is a shame.My final positive would be that there was a fairly satisfying ending. When Maleficent came back to life in her true phoenix form and peace was restored i couldn't help but feel happy and excited for the characters. And the wedding for aurora and phillip was great and i appreciated the nod of changing her dress colour like the original animated movie.However i have to end on my final two negatives. The final act was terrible and the whole film really lacked in action. There was not a lot of action sequences which unless you have heap loads of story and character development which this film didn't it makes the film boring clunky and bland. And when it came to final battle in the final act i thought it would win me over slightly but it still didn't. Even when there was action sequences they were still fairly poor and bland so this was just a really bad ending to the movie despite the satisfying ending.overall despite some good performances,great visuals and some attempts at character depth and development. The film is bought down by its lack of creativity,poor script and how unsure of what characters to focus-on.

85,eberkerbatur,The film takes you to a whole new world it is not a great movie but enjoyable one (7.1),7,24 October 2019,"I can say that I enjoyed watching it very much,the images were great it was actually a classic Disney movie but according to the first film I think there was improvement
especially effects and large-budget scenes for example, the final scene was great, and I did not expect such a war in this movie was really successful.I don't know if a sequel is needed, but 5 years have passed,it's a bit too many people forget the first movie and it's hard to follow some events I think that's going on between the movies shouldn't be too long more than 3 yearsAnyway, the film is not great to watch but it is very enjoyable to watch in the cinema takes you to a completely different world",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
86,ayoreinf,Some times sequels do improve on the oriuginal,8,24 October 2019,"I remember well seeing the original and feeling it was a big waste, of beautiful setting and CGI, and of a brilliant performance by Angelina Jolie and Elle Fanning. Because there was no real antagonist in that movie. All the baddies were nothing more than cardboard cut outs, a fault that killed all possibility for real conflict in the film.It's been fixed here, by all means. Michelle Pfeifer is doing a superb job as the evil and calculating queen. Elle Fanning has grown in strength as an actress combining fierceness and bravery with the innocence she still radiates. (not an easy combination to pull out). And most of the supporting cast does a very professional job. Even the cartoon fairy godmothers from the old cartoon version Disney made way back at 1959 that were so pathetic in Maleficent, were given some more character to work with. And even an inside joke about the color of Aurora's wedding dress.Dont worry. It's still Disney. There's still forced ending, and certain characters have a total change of heart out of the blue, just because the plot has to move toward the end we all expect. But there's no surprise here, we also knew it was Disney when we got in. So all things considered this is much much better than the original. We might even look forward to chapter three.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

It is a cool spin on Sleeping Beauty with some Gargoyles thrown in for good measure. In this one the human marries the prince but the evil step mom doesn't want to unite the swamp and the city people. The special effects were amazing and the story moved along nicely. Fun for the whole family, maybe 13 and up though.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
88,movieman6-413-929510,"Maleficent 2 remains fun for the young fans, but isn't much more.",4,19 October 2019,"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is the sequel to the first Maleficent film of 2014. This sequel is directed by Joachim Rønning, the director of Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge.In the film, the relationship between Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) and her goddaughter Aurora (Elle Fanning) is changing when Prince Philip (Harris Dickinson) asks her to marry him. The bond between Maleficent and the future in-laws of Aurora is a bit tense, because the in-laws mainly know Maleficent from her dark deeds from her past. Aurora and Philip are trying with their marriage to ensure that the different kingdoms of people and fantasy creatures can live so peacefully next to and with each other.
Despite all these peaceful plans, someone seems to be working on dark plans. When the king becomes cursed with the same curse that brought Aurora into eternal sleep, Maleficent is soon designated as the guilty one. Maleficent therefore leaves the human kingdom, but is wounded. Aurora has to try without the help of her godmother to investigate who is behind the dark actions to prevent the threat of a war between the two kingdoms.For this sequel, they have expanded the world of the first film with extra creatures and characters. These extra and recurring creatures serve more as comical entertainment for young viewers. Furthermore, this film also has many beautiful colored images as backgrounds. Of the scenes that Maleficent and other flying characters fly into, they have processed the 3D effects well, so that you can see the depth well. These scenes are extra entertaining for young viewers.
Older viewers can see earlier that they have used CGI and a green screen for these images and characters, so that these things may seem less credible to older viewers.The story is also somewhat predictable for older viewers, as a result of which the film may seem somewhat lengthy to them. If, as a parent, you and your children have enjoyed the first part, it is better to watch it again at home to be able to enjoy the film more yourself. Maleficent also had a greater role in the first part than in this second part. As a parent you can only watch this second part in the cinema if the children want it themselves.The acting is well done by Angelina Jolie, but unfortunately she has a smaller role with less text in this new film. Fortunately, she knows how to bring her character to the fore with only face and body postures. Together with Michelle Pfeiffer she also has some nice confrontation scenes where the two sometimes only create tension with diva eyes facing each other. In this second part, Elle Fanning also gets more chance to shine as a leader of a kingdom, because in the first part her character was cursed for a long time with a sleep curse that prevented her from doing much else. In the first part, Harris Dickinson already felt something like an extra character who had little interest in the film. He has been given a greater role in this new film, but unfortunately with his acting, he still remains as stiff and emotionless as in the first part.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

I wasn't sure what to expect but as a Disney fairy tale movie I expected something far more sickly sweet.This is a well acted, fast paced, novel story with enough twists and a good plot to make it a good film in its own right but add to it brilliant CGI and it makes a very good film.It is still a child's film so it isn't too deep a story but that doesn't detract and it's well worth a watch for kids and adults alike.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

It adds a lot more action and fantasy elements and tells a very standard by the books types story with the central message of acceptance and finding common ground with those whom we have our differences. Admittedly I remembered nothing about the first one, but this movie does a fair enough job to catch audiences up and ended up being a fun little family film.This movie like the first lives and dies on Angelina Jolie's performance and once again she was great, balancing her evil side with the likeability possessed by a true protagonist.

95,galahad58-1,Sleeping Nightmare,4,27 March 2020,"Disney really has lost touch with audiences. Too many remakes, too many ""politically correct"" garbage, and not enough original ideas.The first Maleficent was a nice movie. Jolie made the movie and it was a good fit for her style of performance.This Maleficent is bad. Jolie is the only bright spot - only because she is so beautiful to behold.Let's talk about the silly, juvenile, ridiculous and bad things in the movie: first the Queen hates all fairies and somehow has a secret basement that the King and the Prince have no clue about - no one hears the constant banging of metal to make weapons - or smells the furnaces throughout the entire castle. All the subjects make these weapons knowing that the king is for peace - so the entire kingdom is in rebellion? Secondly, the invitation to dinner - which you know is a trap. Maleficent knows that she does not curse the king, yet does not help him - because it was a dumb idea and would have ended the movie there. Third - the church sequence. Really? The tree fairies and the hundreds of flying fairies just fly around and not a single one attacks the girl playing the organ that is killing them? Could things be that dumb? Lastly- the queen kills hundreds of fairies, tries to kill the king, tries to kill Maleficent, throws Fanning off of a roof, puts every living thing in danger and they - turn her into a goat and laugh. Talk about a stupid letdown. And then after everyone is fighting with pure hatred - they suddenly stop and have a wedding?What a dumb and idiotic movie. The 4 is just for Jolie - the rest would get a 1",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
96,bastos,Bland and forgettable to the surprise of absolutely no one,4,5 January 2021,"These kind of movies are very hard to review because a whole lot of effort has clearly been put into them, making for some beautiful visuals and top notch production design. But they are so forgettable and bland that my brain just rejects them. It's like eating a tasteless candy. The first movie is a good example as I don't remember a thing from it, other than Maleficent's make-up and very scattered plot points. Everything else vanished from my memory. This one I have a feeling will be the same, I don't think I'll remember a thing in two weeks time. And I don't know whose fault is it, maybe the writers? The producers? Something is wrong with this kind of product, but on the other hand the effort of everyone involved is apparent on screen and that is a bit heartbreaking to think of the talent wasted in this movie. And, unfortunately, Hollywood won't stop spewing this movies out, so they must have some financial return which just shows everything that's wrong with the movie industry nowadays.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

One more thing that movies usually Miss when dealing with winged beings is the Size of the wings needed to be able to create lift for a given body..Most hollywood productions have wings much too small in size for any real attempts at flight..In maleficent, her wings suit her form and are properly sized..the way the fold and unfold at times was awesome to behold..I love the theme in this storyline of her meeting with beings like herself...This theme was even More interesting to me than the 1st movie....The fay world was incredible well done and beautiful to witness and maleficent's powers were incredible to behold..if another sequel were done, i'd like to see one that reveals the Origin of her powers and why she looks like other fay, but only she has these powers.. all in all, a very satisfying sequel, that to me ,was better than the 1st and equally of interest to adults as well as kids..",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

While Aurora has matured much since 2014, Diaval has found some humour in himself (which pleased me, being a big Diaval fan) Luckily, Maleficent hadn't changed much, still being incredibly likeable.Really, the only lacking character would be Phillip.

110,snowfre,"Suspense for the youngest, but not much for the rest of us",4,24 March 2020,"Who would have known, Disney actually made a sequel to ""Maleficent"" that turned out to be worse than the first. I'm not surprised. In ""Maleficent: Mistress of Evil"" (why not add a ""2"" instead of the subtitle?), Angelina Jolie returns as the grandiose Evil Fairy, and struggles with family issues as Aurora (Fanning) is about to marry Prince Phillip (Dickinson) which means family dinners with his dreadful mother Queen Ingrith (Pfeiffer). From here, we will witness Maleficent discover a world full of Feys that she leads to war against the humans, as well as some fantasy creature massacres inside a church. The film relies heavily on CGI, to be exact, the portrayal of the many critters and the wonderful world of Fey, it's own little echo system with mountains, deserts, and woods, but it doesn't cover up the very flawed script. There are absolutely no surprises or interesting plot twists, instead, this ""Maleficent"" sequel is like a like warm log ride without any steeps. You simply go with the flow from start to finish, with most of the events in the film being foreseeable. The acting? Over the top. Jolie makes a passable performance as the films misunderstood star fey, once again, but her portrayal seems to stiff, like if every facial expression was rehearsed. Of course there are some pros with this movie as I didn't rate it one star. The log ride feeling is slightly comforting and as I mentioned before, the visuals are adorable. Also, I think ""Maleficent: Mistress of Darkness"" is quite a good family movie, with just the right amount of suspense for younger viewers without scaring them off. Disney, as always, knows how to raise the entertainment value, and that is clear in this film too, despite all the flaws.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

115,elenaphysics,It is good but it is flawed,7,8 November 2019,"I really liked the first Maleficent movie.
I truly believe that neither the first nor the second movie are destined for
children. That being said ,the first movie is more a movie for adults whilst this movie struggles between a kid's movie and an adult movie.
Some elements are just for kids and some are totally not for kids.
The plot is quite simple. You do not expect something groundbreaking as the first movie.
The whole thing with Aurora and Philippe is a bit annoying. Because there was a war ,there were many casualties ,yet they do not take any time to mourn. They want to get married asap.
The evil queen is obviously evil from the beginning. Whilst they could raise some doubts throughout the film and reveal the true villain afterwards.
The worst scene I have watched in a movie for a long time was the scene inside the church where the maniac woman plays the church organ trying to murder the fairies. It is a good thing that they did not die gruesomely otherwise it could have been a horror film. Actually it reminded me the story in Auschwitz with Cyclon B. People unaware of their dark fate entering willingly to a chamber. That it is why it lowered the score of the whole movie. It annoyed me.
Also Aurora acts so stupidly because she does not believe the person who raised her and chooses to stay in the castle. And then Maleficent almost died trying to protect Aurora ,but Aurora was the one who intervened and put them into this position. Which btw should never have happened because maleficent has the magic power supposedly to stop things before hitting her. Why would she take an arrow in her back?
Anw it is what it is. It is a bit messy but I don't regret watching it.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

The first movie was unexpectedly good: a retelling of the Snow White story from the 'wicked witch's' point of view. This movie is what I expected the first one to be; OK but a bit lame.There are lots of character threads here but none are explored. It's looks like the writers just chucked all the regular fantasy tropes together and hoped for the best.

126,just_in_case,Surprisingly good.,8,6 January 2020,"I only read one review of this prerelease, where they applauded it for being bold. After I saw it I flipped through rottentomatoes which gives is a critical 40% and user 85%. About 30 minutes in I was in the 40% and by the end I was in the 85%.I loved the first film. It was all about character abuse, trauma and reconciliation. I think what everyone is annoyed about is why we need a sequel to something like that.Ultimately this film doesn't quite give you an evolution of those themes but it also isn't Return of Jafar.On one hand its another silly humans versus faeries movie and on the other hand it picks up on a small forgotten theme in the first film giving the audience a way to see Maleficent grow as a character.This is one of those films where if there were a 7.5 or something I might click that. I leaned more towards 8 because I can't really come up with an indefensible flaw in the film. It takes about 30 minutes to get going but then its great all the way through. The acting, other than Ed Skrein, (who I normally like but found him a little over the top) was awesome. Everybody chews screen. Michelle Pfeiffer is especially awesome. She has a dress towards the end thats designed like Armor and deserves an award. I found myself weirdly enraptured by Jenn Murray who plays an evil henchwoman whos just creepy as all get out. I immediately began looking up more movies with her in.In summary its as close to great as you can get without being ""hands in the air cheering"" great.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

Which brings me here to the user reviews when I'm trying to decide what I want to watch. Well many users got this one dead wrong. I actually enjoyed this movie more than the first one, which I also enjoyed, but it felt rushed. This one I never felt that. Angelina Jolie is perfect as always and the villain was magnificent.
There are some pretty dark moments. There's a little humor. There's a pretty good battle scene at the end. I was entertained for the majority of the movie. There's a spot where it slows down for a solid 15 minutes, but it was setting up the finale.

The plot was simply excellent all-around, from start to finish.Angelina Jolie again did her thing and performed at the level that we expected and was a pleasure to watch.The main villain did a good job too; she was truly a detestable villain who was absolutely essential to the plot's success.The actress playing the princess actually did her homework this time. Her performance was so poor in the prequel that I did not even bother looking up her name. She turned it around and did a good performance in this film. Maybe the change of director helped get better acting from her? Or maybe because she had five more years of experience in acting? Whatever the case, she did a better job this time around.The supporting cast was fine too; some did better than others, but overall the quality of the supporting cast was better than the prequel. The supporting cast can still get better though, so I hope that that they are better in the next sequel.This movie is actually re-watcheable and recommendable, unlike the prequel which you would only want to watch once and then forget about it.The animations were excellent.Got a happy ending too, and one that felt natural and was not forced.The fate of the villain was appropriate and made sense and I was content with the decision; and it was funny too.I will wait patiently for Maleficent 3, whether it comes out in 2022 or 2024 or whenever. I have high expectations and hope it is another 10/10.Conclusion: this was an excellent movie from start to finish. The plot was excellent from start to finish. Angelina Jolie was excellent as usual. Elle Fanning did a good job this time. The villain did pretty good. The animations were excellent. The supporting cast was better10/10",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

This is true ESPECIALLY in the final battle.Humans die, dark fey dies, and creatures from the Moors die in the final battle. But when the battle ended, no one cared that people -and creatures alike- died. There were quite literally no consequences, at all. Because we all know that weddings make up for murder.Other than the fact that there no consequences, I loved the visuals, and if they made a third one, I'd love to know more about the history of the dark fey.

The effects are fine but the script is a mess.

She's average looking even in full make up, when she tried to be deep she came along as pretentious. She's got nothing on her sister.The story itself is a Romeo and Juliet type of thing. Aurora came off as unlikeable how she was so quick to betray her mum. She makes it clear from the start she chooses her man and his wicked family. There wasn't a huge, complicated plot, just lots of action scenes. Too childish for an adult, too creepy for children. There are some very strange characters that resemble beasts.

145,Kirollos-Noah,Not as good as the first one,5,26 October 2019,"Happy Halloween, and welcome to my review of Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, the movie that got spoiled by its trailer, not the movie's fault though, it's all the marketing's fault!Maleficent: Mistress of Evil was directed by Joachim Rønning, screenplay by Micah Fitzerman-Blue, Noah Harpster and Linda Woolverton. And starring Angelina Jolie, Elle Fanning, Michelle Pfeiffer, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Harris Dickinson and Sam Riley.The sequel to the global box office hit, continue the story after 2 years where the first one was ended, now Maleficent and her goddaughter Aurora begin to question the complex family ties that bind them as they are pulled in different directions by impending nuptials, unexpected allies and dark new forces at play. The years have been kind to Maleficent and Aurora. Their relationship, born of heartbreak, revenge and ultimately love, has flourished. Yet the hatred between man and the fairies still exists. Aurora's impending marriage to Prince Phillip is cause for celebration in the kingdom of Ulstead and the neighboring Moors, as the wedding serves to unite the two worlds. When an unexpected encounter introduces a powerful new alliance, Maleficent and Aurora are pulled apart to opposing sides in a Great War, testing their loyalties and causing them to question whether they can truly be family.Maleficent was a really cool movie, I really liked it, so I was super-excited to see the sequel, and it was OK, it's not as good as the first one was, but still mediocrely-OK.Maleficent: Mistress of Evil has its own story, it gives Maleficent a whole new backstory, and just like the first movie, it's a different story than what we saw in Sleeping Beauty, and as it was in the first one, the changes were welcome!Let's talk about the improvements over the first movie:
The movie's visually stunning, the colors, the cinematography.. everything with the visuals was just perfect, if it got nominated for an Oscar for the best special effects this year, I wouldn't be surprised.Aurora aka Sleeping Beauty, played by Elle Fanning, is getting involved into things now, she finally does something other than just being fascinated with everything around her!The plot is predictable, but it gave Maleficent a great backstory, I got even more interested in her, even though the movie didn't give her justice by not giving her enough screenplay.The drag-down from the first one:
Maleficent was my favorite character in the movie, if you read my review of Maleficent you would know how much I loved her, and all thanks goes to the A+ performance by Angelina Jolie! Unfortunately the sequel cut out the character that elevated the first one, Maleficent isn't there much in the movie, she didn't have enough screenplay, she doesn't talk much in the movie, and that's massively disappointing, because in every scene she's in it, I was so entertained, and that was not more often in the movie, though Angelina Jolie kills it once more as Maleficent!Harris Dickinson as Prince Philip, for some reason Brenton Thwaites didn't want to do it, is terrible, Dickinson is there more often and his acting was cringe-worthy, I didn't enjoy his part in this movie at all, he was so soulless and stiff, and the chemistry between him and Fanning wasn't also good, I prefer Thwaites over him, he's more talented and funnier, he didn't get his chance in the first one, but I think he could have been way better than Dickinson.As I said earlier, the marketing for this movie spoiled almost everything, but that's not the movie's problem, but a voice came at the beginning of the movie that spoiled some of the following events too, so why it that? Why would you spoil the movie at the beginning?
There was a voice to explain their feelings and all those stuff in the first one too, but they didn't spoil anything, unlike this one.The first movie's OST was better than this one's, that doesn't mean that this one's OST is bad or anything, but the first one was better.The villain in the first movie to some was Kind Stefan, and to some it was Maleficent, Stefan or Maleficent, they both were interesting, but this one's villain was not that interesting at all, it was dull actually sometimes, and her motivations are so weak, but her character was a little bit likable, but that's because of Pfeiffer's likable performance.
The first act was fun, it has some cool Maleficent scenes, a great confronting scene, which sadly was spoiled in the trailers.. the narrative was going in a good way actually.The second act was okay, the narrative issues started to show, but it was okay, we got introduced to some new characters, who some of them are actually dull, Borra, played by Ed Skrein, who's the entire movie is wanting war, or just growling in a weird way, who also represents the villain but in those dark-fairies' world, just like the one in the humans' world, also Conall, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, who represents the one who wants peace and harmony, just like King John in the humans' world, but overall the second act was OK.The third act though is my biggest issue with the movie, I'll try to be as less spoily as I can get. The third act has some weird things, the spindle can give now memories to Aurora, the villain has the ability to make a fairy forgets who he is by removing their win,gs and it's also so very rushed, the movie is almost 2 hours, and yet the third act is rushed, they could cut some scene out from the second act or make the movie a little longer, because the movie got really rushed, people got convinced by some stuff really quickly without asking questions, and you could feel that rushing in some of directions that the movie took in the third act. It also has a very dumb death-relive scene, it was a great scene, with some powerful performances, it's one of my favorite scenes in the movie, but the execution of that scene was very dumb!Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is not as good as the first one was, but it's still OK, though it suffers during some of the second act and the third act.I'm gonna give Maleficent: Mistress of Evil a C+.Happy Halloween, guys, it's getting close, I'll be reviewing a lot of horror and Halloween movies a lot til the end of October, so stick right here if you liked this review! And as always thank you for reading my review.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
146,helenbassett,Disney Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil Film Review - Well Well Joachim Rønning Directs Abgelina Jolie Like A Phoenix Rising,10,11 November 2019,"In Disney's Maleficent we saw the young fairy's childhood love become her foe as he clipped her wings to help him become King in a rival human kingdom. A spell was cast and the fairytale became legend. But on the other side of the Moors there was another mighty kingdom from where Prince Philip came to find his Sleeping Beauty. And in Maleficent: Mistress of Evil the fairy folk of the Moors have orchestrated his proposal for Elle Fanning, the beautiful Queen Aurora. She says Yes. But her Fairy Godmother says No. Angelina Jolie already on fine form as she literally swoops in as the panto villain. But we know she was given a bad press. Wonder who started that rumour?Putting aside the fact that Aurora was originally woken from Maleficent's spell by true love's kiss, and it wasn't Prince Philip. Maybe the change of prince will make a difference. With Harris Dickinson now taking on the princely duties. But Maleficent is incandescent with rage. Meanwhile Philip's parents are thrilled. With Robert Lindsay as King John and Michelle Pfeiffer as Queen Ingrith, welcoming Queen Aurora and the chance to join their kingdoms. Both human and fairy folk. Maybe, because deep in the dungeons one cute as a button mushroom gets nearer the toast.Trying to be encouraging Philip has a proposal for Maleficent, come to dinner and meet the parents. Hilarity ensues as Sam Riley's raven Diaval coaches Maleficent in how to create the right impression among the human folk. And Aurora suggests a scarf to cover Maleficent's horns. Magnificent as they are. But it does not go well between the warring mothers, and after King John is mysteriously struck down, Maleficent is guilty as charged, and tries to flee. Her fall hastened by Jenn Murray's Gerda. Ingrith's Commander-in-Chief. Plucked from the water we explore the origins of Maleficent and the Dark Fae from there she came. I didn't see that coming.Leaders Chiwetel Ejiofor and Ed Skrein have differing opinions about the human folk above, while living a banished underground life in caverns. Their story is darker than the technicolor Moors. As the movie opened it was like when Dorothy lands in Oz with the glorious colour and happy little fairies and magical folk. The dark fae should be soaring above that dreamscape. And Maleficent gets a whole new wardrobe too. The statuesque Angelina is dressed in what looks like Bottega Veneta draped style. Completely different from her usual gowns. In fact the costumes by Ellen Mirojnick are all so beautiful. With Michelle Pfeiffer wearing the most incredible pearl encrusted and embroidered gowns, and provides Aurora with the most beautiful wedding gown. But it's not made my fairies. Ingrith wants to be the mother Aurora never had, and sweet Aurora distraught at Maleficent's spell on King John, happily plays along with her mother-in-law to be.And when the fatal plans are revealed there seems little hope for the innocent fairy folk of the Moors, with the dark fae no match against the human iron. A battle will come and Queen Ingrith is ready to ruin. After Michelle Pfeiffer's fantasy role in Stardust she is perfect for the beautiful queen with her own sad backstory.So many paths for Disney to direct the next Maleficent story. But for Mistress of Evil Joachim Rønning has created a solid story with gorgeous production design by Patrick Tatopoulos and a glorious cast. And Maleficent is magnificent.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

148,tyson-hunsaker,Poorly constructed and lacking in any heart or authenticity.,3,18 January 2020,"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is a follow up to 2014's Maleficent and that film wasn't the best or the worst. This follow up lacks any kind of originality or heart or in fact, any story actually worth telling. The film is dead set on treading only familiar paths and creating characters that are neither compelling or worth worrying about. The cast are a bunch of fine actors but with an inexperienced director with no vision, the performances feel misguided and without motivation.As a children's film, it doesn't work either. Any attempt to convey a positive message is squandered by a confused script and jumbled themes. It feels like, like many Disney projects, like an amusement ride with new decorations. Nothing screams that this film should've been make only to cash in on the mild success of its predecessor. It's not worth time or money to see and this level of mediocrity shouldn't be supported.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

Not as much I enjoyed the first maleficent movie, but still very good.Only three problems i have in the movie: was too fast paced, revealed the evil queen's plans way too soon and trying to squeeze in & cram many angles & shots in every scene. That's the only problems in the movie I don't like.What I Truly enjoy the most is the strong family love, aurora & maleficent have for each other. When aurora said that that maleficent was her mother near the end, got teary eyed.When maleficent was reborn from the ashes (with help from auruora's tears), that was the most awesome and touching moment.Good movie I gave it an 8/10.

Also the film is too dark. But apart from that it is a very nice film for older older ordincessant.,Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
152,FixedYourEnding,Surprisingly good,7,6 January 2020,"It's hard to reinvent the wheel every single time. Especially after Maleficent (2014) already did that for the classic Sleeping Beauty story with good amount of success. So this movie will not have any elements that will shock you, however Disney writers manage to produce a decent story which is both entertaining and both visually pleasing to watch.Angelina Jolie is great in that role and just watching her on the screen is a treat. Michelle Pfeiffer is, not surprisingly, doing a great job as the not-so-innocent queen. As children stories goes, it is quite predictable, but since this is a PG movie don't expect too many plot twists, it is written to cater to a certain audience and does that excellently.Overall I recommend you give this movie a try if you're looking for a good family movie and you don't mind some phantasy scenery.

I enjoyed the world and vibrancy of the Dark Fey but it tickled the same nerve as Avatar did so, while fun and sparking childlike excitement in me, it was not freshly handled.The conclusion was hasty and VERY Disney.Although more for younger audiences I appreciate those Disney productions that ""sneek"" in content appealing to older audiences and I thought this production could have done just that.Pluses for Jolie, the dark fey and Pfeiffer and ""meh"" for most of the rest.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
164,MplusA92,A true Disney movie.,8,23 October 2019,"Do you remember those Disney movies where there's an original story, hero and princess, catchy palace, beautifully strange creatures, and classic good and evil?!Well, all of this is found here, all in right amount, and with a lot of surprises.The first movie is much simpler compared to this one, here they added more creatures, more villains, more complicated but enjoyable story and we go deeper into the world of Maleficent and her history.The movie starts with the same style as the first one, a magical opening to a Disney movie,that was preceded by a mysterious scene ,which makes the suspense starts so early. Then the events continue and we see the good and evil sides clearly.In addition, we see new dimensions of Maleficent, we go deeper into her personality, her past, her roots, and of course we see different and beautiful outfits for her.The world of Maleficent which was built in the first part is now got bigger, more detailed, and so catchy to the eyes of both adults and children.What matters for adults here is the story, and it's a great one, very solid and built in a way that keeps your eyes on the screen all the time, and it can make you drop some tears.Finally, it's a must watch movie for all Disney fans, also for any drama/mystery movie fan that wants to watch some magic moments on the screen.

It is not clear who the intended audience is for this mix of Disney and Game of Thrones. The apparent body-count in this film seems unusually high for a Disney release.

And I was thinking: I will give this a good review!But oh! Nearing the climax of the movie the story and choices got sooooo simple and stupid, that even with my mind completely turned off to just enjoy, it got almost impossible to swallow....

A perfect way to spend a couple of hours with the kids, maybe a little scary for very young children but great for all others. Very well made and acted and the CGI is impressive. A great tale of fantasy, love and conflict.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

Maleficent not a bad movie but it certainly isn't one of Disney's best. Good acting performance by Michelle Pfeiffer a.k.a Queen Ingrith. She really did it.

175,JoeYabuki,Boring and not good,5,24 October 2019,"I liked the new reinterpretation of sleeping beauty of 2014. Something ""original"" that changed the classic story. This second installment does not match the previous one. Spend a lot of time rambling and avoiding to arrive at 2 hours. VERY SLOW and in essence almost nothing happens. Angelina eats the movie, Disney really knew how to choose it very well. Michelle Pfeiffer as the human villain who wants to end all rare beings and that the world is only human does well. On the other hand we see that Maleficent finds other Dark Fairies equal to her and that reminded me a lot of How to train your dragon 3, but this one is badly told compared to the other. If the movie takes 30 minutes I would give it an 7, but with my note I am being benevolent.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
176,ivo_shandor,What a hoot,3,28 September 2020,"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is the long lost season 3 of Galavant. If you pretend it's a third season, things seem slightly less stupid. If it were a musical, you could guess every moment that they would come in. Once that thought was in my brain, it made the movie more funny and easier to get through. Surprisingly, it's better than the first film, but it's still got it's fair share of stupid. I never knew that Sonic The Hedgehog and Toad from Super Mario Brothers would ever be in a fantasy film. I'm surprised Nintendo didn't notice the comparison. The characters are actual characters this time, considering the first time Aurora had no personality and just ran after shiny things like a cat. Prince Philip is replaced by another bland actor man #2, which tells you how much confidence they had in him in the first movie. He's a character this time, but it's your standard loyal prince persona, and at least he stayed consistent. Angelina Jolie seems to enjoy playing Maleficent and she gets some mildly humorous dialogue. Other characters are just there, no purpose or character, just filler for the background. If you ever want a cold manipulating person in a movie, cast Michelle Pfeiffer, she seems to enjoy it. The production design is actually thought out this time, with Maleficent's race in different environments and showing their culture. It reminded me of How to Train Your Dragon 3, which is a detail that was sadly missing from that movie. Our Hidden World should have shown different dragons from different environments and how they live. One point to Maleficent for detail. The rest of the movie seems more fit for children than the first, it's safe, bland, sappy, but it's harmless. I was actually shocked to see Warwick Davis in the movie. He looks like he wandered off the set from the latest Harry Potter or Willow film, but he's always fun to watch. The title is weird too, cause Maleficent really doesn't do anything evil in the movie, and there are still some moments that are too dumb for words. It's flopping, which shouldn't be a shock to anyone, but it's not as infuriating as something like Dark Fate. Good thing for kids, bland distraction for adults, better than the first, but bland and safe. The movie just made me want season 3 of Galavant.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

The ability to instill fear in your subjects and then use that fear against your enemies. So I spread this story of the evil witch and the princess she cursed. It didn't matter who woke Sleeping Beauty. They were all terrified and the story became legend. I know you think I'm a monster but what I did... I did for Ulstead."" - (a prominent character in the film)This quote aptly summarizes a process some call racism and veils it under the innocent guise of self-preservation. Furthermore, the film itself has all the trappings of psychological priming and predictive programming. On the one hand it is extremely open and obvious to many adult eyes while not being directly decipherable to the minds of preadolescence. Yet, experts in the field of psychology assure us that they are no less influenced by such implied perceptions on whiteness (humanity in this case) and OTHER minority classifications (dark Fey from Moor in this case). Ultimately, this flick serves to perpetuate the status quo or zeitgeist of present day society working at us from our subconscious minds. The average moviegoer -being interested in mostly the entertainment value- will likely overlook or undervalue the significance of such tactics.

181,pinkled5,"Better Than the First One, But Still Lacking",6,21 October 2019,"The beginning of the film is excellent, developing the relationship between Aurora and her godmother, which is engaging to watch. Aurora wants to marry and Maleficent doesn't trust humans. She must meet the family however and the tension and conflict between the two families, especially the two matriarchs, is wonderful. Had the rest of the film been about these things it probably would have been great, but then Maleficent goes and joins her brethren and we're introduced to a plot that has nothing to do with the story that we were introduced to. These creatures who are like Maleficent want to wage war with humankind but I'm afraid their story isn't interesting or compelling. I don't care about them or what they want, I want to get back to Aurora's relationship with Maleficent and Maleficent's conflict with the wicked queen!It gets better in the end and I enjoyed the conclusion of the film, despite some overall silliness with a church and a pipe organ, because it focused again on the relationship between Aurora and Maleficent.

This is truly what happen in real life as well, but Disney depict it in a fantasy style.The cinematography is breathtaking. The special effects are always eye-catching. Some parts, towards the ending, is somewhat unnatural, because it's just too easy for the protagonist to unravel the hidden evil intention from the antagonist, disregarding the impossibility it may seem.

Maleficent was a modern take on a fairy tale with a twist ending. Nice. And that's where the story ends. Maleficent-Mistress of Evil is completely new material and a worthy continuation of the story about Aurora and her Godmother. It expands the world of Maleficent and even leaves room for a third sequel should a good story be made.

188,kmjnhh123,- Angelina Jolie Is The Perfect Maleficent -,7,20 October 2019,"So i saw the first film and gave it a 8, i give this one a 7.Angelina Jolie was again amazing at playing Maleficent, she really knows how to give that badass look but keep cool at the same time & then just suddenly flip at the right moment. She undergoes numerous outfit changes throughout the film and she looks incredible in every outfit.Great to see Elle Fanning again, she plays a good role in between the middle of 2 worlds, does she keep peace or go out with all war, so she has to discover what is happening & how to unite both sides. On another note go and watch ""The Neon Demon"" with Elle Fanning, that's a big role change from that to this, that film will leave a mark on you, honestly be pre pared.Typical Disney bright & colourful with gigantic castles in film as always, although there was quite a few dark parts in the film compared to the first one, by in the end everything works out as usual. The beginning of the film is good then the mid sections kinda just pre pare for the ending battle which yea was cool but it was obvious what was going to happen with the queen being evil and all that, but then again it is a kids film mostly, so they won't pick up on this stuff.There was humorous parts throughout the film which was funny, a couple of adult jokes snuck in there for the adults to enjoy, the kids won't understand it.Overall it was a alright watch, its not a film that i will speak about for years to come.Age - 25

190,imjaredross,A Forgetful but Not So Terrible Sequel,6,19 November 2019,"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is the sequel to the very successful first film. It sees the return of Angelina Jolie in perhaps the role she was born to play. It also sees the return of Elle Fanning as well as a new character played by Michelle Pfeiffer. Picking up right after the events of the first film, Princess Aurora is to be wed to Prince Philip and visits her family where her godmother Maleficent is invited as well, but soon things turn to the worst as Maleficent turns against everyone and now we have our sequel.I'm actually a fan of the first film. It's revisionist fairytale meant to show the story from the villains point of view and for the most part I thought it worked fine. The film was also elevated by great performances from its leads and the same can be said here. The performances in this film from out three leading ladies are really good especially in regards to Jolie and Pfeiffer who work so well together as adversaries.The film is also beautifully shot with bright colors and impressive looking worlds. The costumes are fantastic, but with so much visual splendor the film can't help but feel artificial at points. The film also is not held back by the story of the first film which for the most part was a simple retelling of Sleeping Beauty, but here the writers and filmmakers had the freedom to take the story wherever they wanted. However, they don't really go far enough.The plot of Maleficent 2 is by far its weakest asset. It has some new additions, adding to the new mythology hinted at in the prologue of the first film with Maleficent and her people. That stuff is interesting, new and creative, but that's only part of the film. The rest of the film simply feels like a retread of what was I. The first film, only with new characters spliced in.Overall, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is a sequel that has interesting ideas but doesn't do enough with them, leaving a film that feels rather empty and unnecessary. It has good performances, good visuals, but can't make up for its bland unremarkable and recycled story.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

193,paq5528,High Production Value didn't translate to Great Story,5,3 January 2020,"Is this a beautiful movie with a great cast? Definitely.
And Jolie and Pfieffer are at their best in their respective roles.We start off with true fun and fear in equal measure from Maleficent, and we equally see through the treachery that is the Queen. The dinner sequence really punches you in the gut and lays out both sides brilliantly. And that is about where the good writing ends.Basing a Disney movie on a genocide and having people betray each other faster than light is simply not good writing. It's cliche, it's boring. The ""Queen"" of the forest, raised by Maleficent, betrays her mother in about 2 seconds. The King and Prince are useless.We are also meant to believe that after the forest is degraded into a muddy swamp mess that the entire population of the forest simply walks into a closed container, where some evil androgynous -- disagreeable character -- lobs poisonous gas over the ""prisoners""? Is this Auschwitz? And then being Disney, only a few die, despite showing the explosive death strength of the poison used.Maleficent's ""cousins"" all scale up the one wall expected, where all armies and ranged weapons are trained, but they can't seem to attack from the sides or behind? Honestly, what is flying good for? Reminds me of GOT and the 2nd dragon death sequence, if you know what I mean.And finally after hundreds if not thousands of living beings on both sides die, we are meant to believe that everything is OK because there was a wedding? So sorry for your loss, but at least the Prince will be having sex tonight!Given the sequences of betrayal, genocide, war, and the fact that Maleficent isn't as evil as a dandelion, this title is wrong and I would not call it a children's movie. Certainly fiction works... The story is extremely unbelieveable! Sadly for Disney, and mostly for the viewers, it also lacks quality writing and creativity.

194,watcher101,They did it again. Why?,4,17 November 2019,"It wasn't enough that they had to ruin Maleficent's character in the first movie, but here, when they had the chance to fix it and make Maleficent the iconic and, arguably, greatest of Disney's villains that she's supposed to be, they still keep her as the misunderstood good guy. I mean, the movie is called ""Maleficent: Mistress of Evil"", but that's certainly not what we got. Even her very name means ""to cause harm"". With the first movie, I thought we were going to get the Sleeping Beauty story from a unique point of view from the villain's eyes, but instead they completely butchered Maleficent's character (others too). In this movie, I thought they were going to fix that and have her fall from grace, kind of like how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader in Revenge of the Sith, making her a tragic villain. That would have been really interesting, but nope, they kept her the good guy. No one liked it the first time, and no one wanted to see it a second time.I mean, the movie was ok for what it was. But this wasn't Maleficent, the amazing villain we all loved. This was just a standard fantasy heroine we've seen a thousand times before. If they wanted to make a movie like this, that's fine, but keep it original, don't mutilate and change Disney's greatest villain until they're completely unrecognizable. Seriously, imagine if for the live-action Lion King they made Scar the misunderstood good guy and Mufasa the villain.

The joy it was to watch Angelina Jolie play a menacing and mischievous character that enjoyed her villainy was great.
I am sitting here and I really can not think of any other Disney Villain since Ursula that has really been at this level of enjoying herself.
I might be wrong but my memory is not helping me on that front.
Not only Jolie was really good with the material given to her, there were other factors that made it enjoyable.
The bombastic orchestral music, the background and twist given to the story were really welcome by me as age of one sided villains has really gone by and you see more and more people question the absolute evil nature of fairy tail villains.
What didn't really work out was the cgi for most of the part and of course the plot mandatory weakening of the super powerful being suddenly for the sake of creating suspense because the writers are either bankrupt with ideas or just don't care to work something better in it.
But the sequel has just gone out of its way to not justify its reason for existence.
The very writing that was lacking in parts in the first movie has come completely undone and is barely coherent.
The music has been shoved back into the closet because that is where the sound was coming from and now Maleficent is BRUCE WAYNE, she is brooding ALL THE TIME!
Gone is the witty Maleficent and in is Bruce Wayne. In fact I am being unfair to Wayne because even he has some charming wittiness to him, this maleficent has none.
This seems to be a major issue with Disney writing in the past years.
Characters that have been established one way are suddenly flipped to complete opposite with no sense to make of it.
The worst offender is of course the CGI, these plasticy looking creatures plastered through out the movie are not going to age well and I know this because they already look bad.
A movie that has no coherent script, with actors clearly not feeling it and it is 99 percent cgi...

Cue a slow paced plot, and a shortage of dutiful character exploration!By and large, this movie felt fairly tedious. It seemed as if it was nothing more than ""Well. The first one made enough for a sequel...throw something together quick!"" Oh yes Maleficent...didn't you know that your species was just a quick five minute flight away?! You've spent thirty-some years (being generous!) without ever noticing them flying about...not even once. So Oreo wants her ""Mother"" to meet Phillip's mother...cue a My Fair Lady scene! Well Queen Pfeiffer has a chip on her shoulder towards Fay-Folk it seems. Though it seems that her hatred might be justified. Seems her brother was killed by fairies. The movie does absolutely nothing to counter this plot point. So really...she's not wrong. Her methods might be questionable...but she does seem to have a point...fairies have killed people before. While humans have done so as well...the movie takes great pains to point out that Queen Pfeiffer is a nutjob. Certainly an ethnic cleansing isn't the answer, but she does have legitimate reasons for her mistrust and hatred. But moving on. Queen Pfeiffer poisons the King and frames Mal for it. Apparently she used the spinning wheel to do it...that will teach you to leave poisonous cursed objects just lying around! So despite the fact that Oreo named Mal as her mother not long ago...she is convinced of her guilt. Mal has to flee but is shot down. She is then saved by one of her own species. Waking up, Mal learns that she has her own species...who may or may not have powers...its rather unclear. They say they don't, then they're commanding the forces of nature to their aid. So Mal is given a little tour of the Aiwa tree from Avatar, then a tour through the biomes. We're told that this is why the various ""Dark Fay"" look different, and have different colors. Handy that all these various biomes were all right here next to each other! Then we're told that Mal is not a dragon, but rather, a Phoenix. A dark phoenix? Ooooohhhh. War comes. A lot of fairies die, few humans die, and Mal becomes a phoenix. Queen Pfeiffer gets turned into a goat, and everyone lives happily ever after...except all the dead people.All in all, this movie is far more of a 'visual' film rather than a plot driven one. Most of the actors (Angelina included) seem to be mailing in their performances most of the time. The narrative, I found, was hard to invest in. There seemed to be nothing to 'hang your hat on'. When we discover Mal's people...we don't really learn anything about them. Other than the two main guys...I don't think a single fay talks to her. It was a completely wasted opportunity to explore her background, and for her to learn about her people. Why and how did she get separated from them? Did she have family among them? Who cares? We've got Queen Pfeiffer's story to set up and then abandon. That seems to be what this movie was really. Things being half-set up...then abandoned.

210,Iusedtobeacat,Not that good.,5,10 November 2019,"PROS:
1-the theme is meant to be about unity, peace, and how different cultures and creatures can come together. I think the overall message is make love not war which is a very positive thing to promote so I'm not against that.
2-The special effects were nice, the setting was nice, the customs were nice. Overall, it's a visually appealing movie.CONS:
1-There was a lot of violence in this film for a kids' movie. I guess this is promoted as family friendly because there were a lot of parents and their kids at the theater and it does appear as a kids' film, but there is a ton of violence going on. Some pretty dark stuff if you ask me, imprisonment, torture, death, among others .. I'm not sure it's very family friendly.
2-There was no humor involved. The movie was very dramatic and normally family friendly films are meant to be humorous and funny but this one just wasn't.
3-Angelina Jolie wasn't given much opportunity to shine in this one. Yes, she still does a good job as Maleficent but somehow the plot is very limiting. You don't see Maleficent as this three dimensional character in this movie. You see her as a 2-D character at best. Which made the film lackluster IMO.
4-The supporting characters were annoying for the most part and it took them quite a while to understand what was going on. Which made it frustrating from an adult's POV to sit through this film.I don't think this movie is the worst ever, I think it's average. There are better options out there.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
211,D31an,I think...,7,9 November 2019,"...that Disney forces the story of Maleficent purely because of profit. I do not think it would have any continuation if Disney would not made it up. I am surprised that Disney did not made a sequel to, say, Dumbo or Aladdin, but rather chose to make a sequel to the horned Maleficent. And better yet, none of the other fairies have any horns, but Maleficent and ""her species"" do. Who would expect that Disney (a family entertainment company) would exploit/promote the image of Lucifer?
Nonetheless, I enjoyed the story/ies but not fully since I knew that Disney became tendentious with this one. I will wait to see what will Disney do with the fairies in its Artemis Fowl... ...give them horns as well?",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

213,mldardar,"Another movie murdered by extremist nonsensical political ""correctness""!",3,6 January 2020,"First, I loved the leads performances, & even most of the supporting actors, & it was beautifully filmed, with nice special effects. Elle was born for this fairy tale princess character! I was regretting Sam Riley hadn't been cast as the Prince, but was just happy he was back.
The flaws & destruction of the film: The little hedgehog-looking character seemed thrown in just for young kids. But as it went on, the director/producers' pressure to make the film appealing to every race became more obviously until it became blatant by midway. They sacrifice the all-powerful one-of-a-kind Maleficent for a struggling tribal-like race of creatures, who've been struggling to survive against humans. Then we have the characters who show up in all such stories, from the earliest cowboy & Indians movies to Avatar, etc to infinity, if the studios don't stop: the leader who wants peace with the encroaching people & the rebel who wants to annihilate them. This one like many in recent movies is more similar to the punk gangster on the streets of London. It tries to redeem itself in the end, but it's too late. But I could barely muster a grin for the rest of the movie. On the other hand, my wife loved it. Not being American, she only saw it for the fantasy it is. Lucky her.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

War scene was quite unique and its hard to achieve that these days with all the superhero movies around. Elle Fanning looked beautiful. More suited to play Aurora than she was in the 1st film.

The special effects are still gorgeous. Needless to say, the high standard of Disney. From the characters, the depiction is very detailed and realistic, and the costume design is also beautiful !

219,pearlinasilverbasin,"Not terrible, not good. Completely forgettable",6,27 October 2019,"This movie could have been much better. The story falls flat and lacks structure, with a typical ""humans bad, magical creatures good"" narrative and forgettable villains.
I think the main issue is that the movie can't make up its mind about what kind of movie it wants to be. Does it want to be a dark fantasy movie with Pirates of the Caribbean-like grimness and violence? Does it want to be a child-friendly movie with a wedding and minimal/shallow conflict? Does it want to have a developed magical world with different lands and species or does it want nearly everything to take place in the same castle? It tries to be like Cinderella, it tries to be like Pirates of the Caribbean, it tries to be like Chronicles of Narnia, with nothing of its own that makes it stand out. (except that one bird's nest cave scene, that was pretty cool.)
To be fair, sometimes the cinematograhpy was absolutely stunning, such as in a bird's nest-like cave Maleficent finds herself in at some point in the movie, or certain shots of the castle and the Moors.If you want a nice movie night with a movie that looks nice, has cool special effects and offends nobody, go for it. If you want a movie that stands out, don't watch this.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
220,sophaljonesy,Fun mix of Game of Thrones and Avatar,8,21 October 2019,"The first Maleficent was interesting because it provided a new spin to the tale of Sleeping Beauty by making Maleficent the protagonist. In the sequel, the mother-daughter relationship between Angelina Jolie's Maleficent and Elle Fanning's Aurora is tested as they end up in opposing sides of the war between faer folk and humans. This CGI-filled spectacle does not sound very interesting but the movie is saved by earnest performances of the cast. Jolie is majestic and menacing as Maleficent. Her nemesis, played my Michelle Pfeiffer is no less regal. They elevate the material, and their face off is almost like a scene from Game of Thrones. In fact, there are many parallels to Game of Thrones. Fanning's Aurora and The Prince are as clueless and idealistic as Jon Snow. Maleficent is almost like a horned Danaerys. Another parallel is to Avatar. The faery world is almost like the planet in Avatar. Similarly, their resources are exploited by humans. It helps that Ed Skrein is in the movie, and he chews every scene he is in. All in all, there is no complaint on the acting department. However, the pacing is uneven, and some scenes drag too long. The emotional scenes are their but lack impact. But the climactic battle is worth the wait. There are even some deaths. In other words, Maleficent is a fun cross between Game of Thrones and Avatar. Definitely worth your time",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
221,jeddjong,Battle Royale Disney style,7,16 October 2019,"In 2014, audiences learnt the back-story behind Maleficent, the villainess of Disney's 1959 animated film Sleeping Beauty. Rather than being just a cackling sorceress, Maleficent painted its title character as someone who rose from tragedy and betrayal to form a complex bond with the young Princess Aurora. Directed by Joachim Rønning (Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge), this sequel continues that story, pitting Maleficent against a conniving, ruthless new foe.Angelina Jolie continues to be all sharp-cheekboned perfection as Maleficent. We were afraid that she might phone in it given that this is a sequel, but she still appears to relish the role. Not only does she gets numerous fabulous costume changes, Maleficent goes on a journey of discovering, getting acquainted with her people and learning about their customs and beliefs. There is a conflict between her allegiance to her fae kin and to Aurora, which gives the powerful character something to struggle with.Much of the film works because of Michelle Pfeiffer. Casting her opposite Jolie was an inspired move. The early promotional materials tried to hide it, but there's no point beating about the bush now - Queen Ingrith is the ""Mistress of Evil"" of the title. Pfeiffer plays the villain with sneer and swagger hidden beneath a regal façade, with shades of her witch character from Stardust sometimes visible. Coming off like a PG-rated Cersei Lannister, it's an absolute hoot.There's a lot going on in the plot of the movie, so it is to writers Linda Woolverton, Noah Harpster and Micah Fitzerman-Blue's credit that the movie never loses sight of its emotional core: the relationship between Maleficent and Aurora. They might not be on the same page for much of the film, but it cannot be questioned that Maleficent deeply loves and cares for Aurora, something Ingrith winds up exploiting.Just as in the first film, the show is stolen by Sam Riley as Diaval, Maleficent's shape-shifting sidekick. Riley manages to be both cool andWhile the visuals are often mesmerising and transporting, the film does lean very heavily on computer-generated imagery. This is expected of a fantasy adventure film, but some of the characters do seem unnatural. The Fairy Godmothers Knotgrass (Imelda Staunton), Thistlewit (Juno Temple) and Flittle (Lesley Manville) return from the first film, and their almost-human facial features sometimes cross over into the dreaded uncanny valley.Prince Philip is boring, but then again, this is something inherent in the source material. Brenton Thwaites, who was busy filming Season 2 of Titans, is replaced by Harris Dickinson, who constantly seems a little bit confused and flat. However, this is also a sign that the film understands that Philip is not the main character, and that he does not have to be the hero to save the day.
Chiwetel Ejiofor is almost completely wasted in a relatively small supporting role.The action sequences in Maleficent: Mistress of Evil are grand and expansive. Like most big-budget high fantasy projects these days, it seems more than a little derivative of Game of Thrones, but the big battle scenes are dynamic and lively. The movie gets surprisingly dark, with the villain's plot involving genocide by way of biological warfare. However, the movie still has a bounce and a sense of humour to it and is never too self-serious the way something like Snow White and the Huntsman and its sequel The Huntsman: Winter's War sometimes were. The big climactic battle takes place in broad daylight, which is a relative rarity in films of this type.This film has a completely different design team than the first but maintains a sense of visual continuity while also giving us something new. The costumes by Ellen Mirojnick are stunning, especially Maleficent's battle outfit which is a sexy, elegant body paint-style number. Production designer Patrick Tatopolous creates some gorgeous fantasy environments, chief of which is the hidden fae sanctuary comprising mini-environments which have different climates.Some of it may be overly familiar, but there's still more creativity to this than to Disney's live-action remakes which are obligated to retrace the steps of their animated forebears. Angelina Jolie and Michelle Pfeiffer pitted against each other is worth the price of admission.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
222,NBates1,More fun than the first!,10,18 October 2019,"A film like this asks its audience to switch off their over-analytical and critical brain cells and have fun with the action on the screen, and there's a lot of fun going on. Angelina Jolie, who has been absent from the big screen for a while, reminds us all she was born to play and own this special role. She possesses a rare screen presence for modern-day Hollywood, one that reminds us of the classic Goddesses of the Golden Age (Garbo, Crawford, Davis, etc.). With one look, she can convey so much and watching her on the big screen is a pleasure. Michelle Pfeiffer gives it her all as an absolutely hell-bent Queen, and the scene where she and Maleficent try to out-b*tch each other is iconic. Elle Fanning delivers well, better than her role in the first film, and the rest of the cast were good. I do wish that Chiwetel Ejiofor was given more to do, though.
The film is aesthetically breathtaking in terms of production design, costume design, VFX and cinematography. The battle scene was insane, and I was quite surprised at the church scene were the fairies are trapped in what is similar to a gas chamber, and it's safe to say there are quite a few casualties, including Flittle. Thinking back, it really is quite disturbing and bold for a family movie.
Maleficent's rebirth into a giant Phoenix/Dragon was epic, but I wish her ties to the creature were better explained beforehand.
All in all, I really enjoyed the experience of Maleficent 2, which was more entertaining than the first, and Miss Jolie is always mesmerizing to watch.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

233,AngelFall1n,"Well, well, Maleficent.",9,30 May 2021,"Love Maleficent, and the movie was fun and a nice escape from reality. The effects and colours/scenery were wonderful. Angelina Jolie is ever so striking and has a strong presence as always. The only issue for me is that there were too many plots going on in a single storyline that it just made the writers let their guards down. It focuses on sending a message of ""Peace"", with diversity and races, LGBTQ, politics and religion. They were confused on what to do in a 2 hour movie, but had to find a credible enough ending. The story seemed to be struggling with Maleficent's evil side, and keeping it watchable for younger audiences. The characters were rather lifeless and subtle with their lines. The genocide/war mixed with a wedding was a bad idea and everything happened too fast. I'm just hoping the writers can be more creative if there's a 3rd film, as wars seem to be the new action trend in today's films; GoT, Wonder Woman, Avengers, Black Panther, to name a few.

The plot is too simple too naive to be accepted. The characters are so dumb and they take so many poor decisions all over the movie. The CGI is actually ok, but sometimes it falls within the uncanny valley, thus looking weird.Spoiler alert for the next part:The bird people could actually win that fight really easily if they weren't that dumb. Instead of trying to do some useless melee attacks, why don't they use their wings? Each one of them can grab a big stone, fly to the stratosphere, away from human projectiles, and drop it over that city, over and over again for a whole year. Humans would surrender in no time.

238,joshtill-98100,"A Stunning Portrayal of Disney CGI, and not much else",6,27 October 2019,"I've started to notice trends with movies alike to Maleficent: Mistress of Evil. They give you a cash grab with its stunning effects, costume pieces, and big actor names, such as Angelina Jolie and Michelle Pfeiffer. However, this is not why the first movie succeeded so well. Maleficent (2014) had all of those ideas, but it had a story which developed and had story arcs and was beautiful to behold. This movie however, is a bunch of excitement and planning for the half-an-hour long battle at the end. It is as if the writers said: We've got tons of money for and there's going to be a great final battle between the fairies and the humans, but we still have to fill the other hour and a bit. How do they do that? With a crappy story that really does not have much of Maleficent in it. It's enough to pass, but not enough to regain its potential charm.The film begins 5 years after King Stefan's murder. Aurora (Elle Fanning) is queen of the moors; the fairy kingdom, and is proposed to by Prince Phillip (Harris Dickinson). Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) is not pleased by the sudden engagement. Phillip comes from a kingdom called Ulstead, which is ruled by King John and Queen Ingrith (Michelle Pfeiffer). Ingrith devises an unknown plan which involves the spinning wheel's spindle from Aurora's deep slumber. The King and Queen invite Maleficent and Diaval (Sam Riley) as well as Aurora to have an intimate dinner with them so they can celebrate the engagement together.While crossing the border, Maleficent is lashed on by the town folk, meaning that there will never be an end to the social war. At dinner, Ingrith begins to bash maleficent for her behaviours, causing Maleficent to lose her temper and lash out. As this goes on, King John feels a shortness of breath and collapses, as Ingrith claims that Maleficent spelled him. Maleficent and Diaval ride off back to the moors, however during her journey, she is shot down by the Queens servant and plunges below into dark water. A mysterious figure alike to Maleficent's shape rescues her and carries her off.Maleficent wakes up in a cave, surrounded by alike creatures to her. The creatures state that Maleficent is the last born from the phoenix, making her important to their species. Aurora stays in Ulstead, where it is announced that the wedding will commence in three days and that all moors folk are to be invited and attending, by order of Queen Ingrith. As Aurora explores the castle, she finds the spinning wheel and is revealed that Ingrith spelled John, not Maleficent. It is also revealed that Ingrith is working with a chemist on a formula that would transform the moors folk into still-life plants.The day of the wedding comes and the moors folk sit in the chapel awaiting the service. Diaval is not let in for he is stuck in Human form without Maleficent's sceptre. The chapel doors are bolted as the queens servant blows the formula onto the guests. Some guests are transformed as the blue fairy sacrifices her life to clog the hole. Ingrith awaits on the balcony waiting for an upcoming battle. The winged-humans, led by Maleficent come to fight, ending up in a large carnage count. Ingrith kills Maleficent with a crossbow in front of Aurora. Aurora's tears transform Maleficent's ashes into a phoenix, stating the prophecy is in fact true.Ingrith pushes Aurora off of the balcony as Maleficent, in phoenix form rushes to save her as they land hard on the ground. As Ingrith attempts to make an escape she is thought to be captured by the fairy-human folk. Maleficent regains back to Human form and finally accepts Phillips proposal for Aurora's hand in marriage. Ingrith is found, still attempting to run, and Maleficent transforms her into a goat. King John is awoken from the curse as Maleficent and her team destroy the wheel and the spindle once and for all. Aurora and Phillip are wed as Maleficent rides off, stating she'll be back for ""The Christening"", as homage for her first entrance.Now, don't get me wrong. Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is nothing short of a great foundation of a film. However, on screen it is more viewed as a boring and long movie that could have been congested into a stunning 45 minute TV movie, because that's all this feels like. A TV movie with a Disney budget. As much as I love Angelina Jolie and Michelle Pfeiffer, I truly thought Elle Fanning shined through the movie, she is the main reason this movie is not a fail. Michelle and Angelina were given quite bland characters and scripts and couldn't really do much with them. Similar to this months Joker, this movie does slightly get better in the second half, but not enough to be entertaining. Maleficent: Mistress of Evil gets a 6.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

But the real scene stealer is Michelle Pfeiffer as Queen Ingrith. She gives new meaning to evil as we see the true evil of the film come through her character.

241,kshirad,"Weirdly ambitious, with higher highs and lower lows",8,19 October 2019,"When Maleficent came out in 2014, I was at the positive side of the spectrum and welcomed its' radical revisioning of a beloved villain. So when the trailer of this movie came out, I'm cautiously optimistic. That being said, I think this one more or less lived up to my expectations, albeit slightly below its' predecessor.The first thing that stood out to me while watching it was the visuals. They really amped it up this time around, and it's really gorgeous. Also, the world-building is quite incredible, if a bit derivative. Yet, it managed to forge its' own identity and move the story forward in unexpected ways.I could never doubt Angelina Jolie's portrayal of Maleficent. She exudes confidence and total command of the screen while staying close to the character. More surprisingly, Michelle Pfeiffer's Queen Ingrith managed to rival her appearance. On a side note, Elle Fanning showed more personality as Aurora than the last one, giving her a bit of spunk, and a particular hench(wo)man that stood out with so little dialogue who's fun to watch.Pros aside, the thing that bothers me a bit was the tonal swings. If you thought that the first one was uneven, this movie somewhat doubled it down. The ending is that particular flaw. Other than that, the characterizations are a bit too broad for the side characters that they fade into the background with all of the visual effects. Weirdly enough, with a movie called Maleficent, they don't show you much of her most of the screen time.Despite all that, none of that could negate what the movie has accomplished. There's something daring and risky of how they construct the story. With the last couple of live-action remakes, it's nice to see some originality and a see-what-sticks approach to a movie. It has a potential to be a cult favorite.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

At first I doubted it was because they disapproved of the message, but even stranger: At some point this same queen is turned into a goat and the group cheered and laughed! So I'm a bit confused, but I still thought this movie had a valuable message about not judging people before you have all of the facts (even if the person's name actually means ""evil""). Of course, in this instance, I have to apply the same lesson to the movie, itself, so I highly recommend it for all little girls. My daughter certainly enjoyed what she could and asked if I would take her again so she could figure out what she had missed (she had missed the latter half due to noise). I decided we would see it again, because it certainly seemed to be a decent enough movie to watch until you've figured it out.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
250,joseph-boik,Makes me wish I had wings!,10,20 October 2019,"It was a fun film, expanding on an original tale of an old story. If you enjoyed the first film, you'll enjoy this one. I didn't see much of trailers, so what the film had in store enchanted me, and I kinda want to go see it again!",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
251,rainfollower-95-646324,"Good beginning, dumb ending",6,16 November 2019,"The movie starts as a very promising story, but in the end I felt really disappointed. It's not that the storytelling itself is bad... It is quite good actually, and engaging, and emotional. But the ending of the whole plot feels really underwhelming. Even worse: it feels really dumb. So dumb that I hardly can believe that it all really ended like this.If you want details, I have two major objections to the story.One of them is that the idea and the moral problems in the movie are all secondhand, taken right from the previous one. Played off differently? Yes! But still the same kind of moral choices. Come on! We have already seen this, and you already told us what's good and what's bad! Tell us something else! Why are you repeating this lesson again?The other objection is how they solve (or rather, do not solve) everything. How it all ends, how it all comes to the ""happily ever after"". I'll say this again: the ending feels really dumb. In the first ""Maleficent"" we could clearly see where exactly was the moral problem, and the physical conflict, and how exactly it could be solved. In this movie... well... we don't. Also, you can clearly see how the story's quality degrades in the second half of the movie. It gets all rushed, and chaotic, and it all rather happens, than being told.You know... It really feels like the writers' team changed in the middle of production. Or maybe there was a deadline at hand, and no way to solve all the complex problems thrown at main characters, so... ""well, let's add some cliches and just consider it all solved, okay? Let's go to happily ever after, already!"" Another reason to think so is all those little things nicely planted in the beginning of the story and never paying off in the end (well, not all, but most of them).But there are good news, too! If you turn off your intellect while watching this, you will have enough fun. The picture is good, the magic creatures are fun, the actors are great, and finally I can praise princess Aurora herself not only for her looks, but also for the emotions she's giving us.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

Stunning colors, effects, costuming and cinematography.
Good balance of comedic relief and drama.
Intense battle scenes, but little/no gore. Probably a bit scary for kids younger than 7. Depends on the kid!
A couple of loose ends and plot holes but I don't mind. I was entertained, and all I can think about is the final dress Aurora wears. (!!!!!) gorgeous!
All in all I thought it was a little lighter than the first Maleficent, and more entertaining! 💜",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
264,loncarkristina,Mistress of evil?,4,21 October 2019,"First of all, I have to say that I am a big fan of the first movie (despite all its flaws), and I am sad to see a franchise with such a great potential be ruined so badly. I wish I didn't have to write this review, but seeing all the positivity being spread around made me want to share a bit of objective criticism.There are three main issues with this movie that poke my nerve really badly.Firstly, the trailer and the title. Both are very misleading, luring the adult audience into thinking Maleficent will go through a Joker-like phase and actually do some evil. Well, the evilest thing we got is stopping a cat mid-air and threatening to kill it, as far as I'm concerned. She didn't even kill the queen (who actually deserved it) just because Aurora gets in the way. What evil are we even talking about?The second thing that bothers me is trying to base a children's movie on war and genocide. I don't know who ever thought of that, but those two things just don't work together. Everything is sugar-coated, and absolutely no realism is presented throughout the movie. Literally no one thought that the two kingdoms could come together except for Phillip and Aurora, the idealistic and naive couple with no experience in the real world politics. (The beginning of the movie is actually a joke that writes itself!) Moreover, the elf that has been aggressive throughout the whole movie suddenly stops after a few kind words from an enemy prince? Give me a break. There are just so many plot incoveniences that stem from trying to make adult themes appropriate for children that it turns the movie into a parody rather than a believable story.Lastly, the writing is just bad... I can't get over the fact that Maleficent has been guarding Aurora her whole life and the girl decides to believe the queen she met five minutes ago. Phillip is utterly useless, he couldn't even tell the court people that Maleficent doesn't stand iron. Also, remember that curse from the first movie that apparently can't be broken? Well, that is not a thing anymore.There are few words that can describe the disappointment I felt after Maleficent resurrected herself on the top of that tower... Finally, I thought when she died, there is the plot twist we were waiting for! But no, because the protagonist in a children's movie simply can't die. And together with the immortality Maleficent gained, she also lost a large chunk of her character and future potential. Remember Jolie's expression when Maleficent found our her wings were cut off in the first movie? That scene gave me chills. Now when Maleficent is practically untouchable, it is a question whether we will get a great scene like that anymore.Let's talk about the queen. In my opinion, she is probably the most developed character in the whole movie. Yes, she may be evil; but her motivation is on point, her hatred towards the moor is justified and the strategy to conquer it almost flawless. She is the only character besides Maleficent that understands the complexity of politics and has no problem putting Phillip in his rightful place. Since this is a children's movie, I honestly expected her to die as well as Stefan did in the first movie, but they didn't even do that... they just turned her into a goat. By the way, Pfeiffer's cold face suits the role perfectly and the costumography is absolutely stunning.If I had to choose one scene that stuck with me the most, it would definitely be the dinner. Little do we know about the queen until then, but the way she makes Maleficent uncomfortable quickly and clearly lets us know what kind of a foe she is. Angelina and Michelle both did an astounding job portraying their respective characters and it was a true pleasure to feel the onscreen tension between them.To summarize, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is a movie that was stripped away from its dignity by writers who clearly do not understand that war is not a theme appropriate for children. As much as I loved the first movie, I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone interested in more than two hours of fun. Hopefully Disney will one day start caring about quality of their movies rather than making money... Such a shame.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

270,kevinthecritic-15200,Maleficent: Mistress of Evil: Darker Sequel Flies Higher Than Its Predecessor,7,22 October 2019,"3.5 out of 5 stars (Above Average)The original Maleficent is a dark horse in Disney's live-action remakes lineup. Its choice to reframe the title character from a malevolent villainess to a scorned anti-hero divided audiences and critics alike, but was still a huge financial success. Now, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil concludes the story by being darker, bigger, and better than its predecessor in just about every way, despite some minor (but forgivable) bumps.In the 5 years since the last movie, Princess Aurora (Elle Fanning given more to do this time) has been made queen of the Moors by Maleficent (Angelina Jolie once again killing it). However, when Prince Phillip (Harris Dickinson replacing Brenton Thwaites) asks for Aurora's hand in marriage, Maleficent is less than thrilled given her tumultuous history with mankind. Worse still, Phillip's mother, Queen Ingreth (the bewitching Michelle Pfeiffer), doesn't buy Maleficent's change of heart and isn't shy about sharing that. Now Maleficent must choose whether to accept Aurora's decision or abandon mankind once and for all.Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is an improvement on its predecessor. Jolie once again disappears into the character and sells her inner conflict without missing a beat. Fanning takes her increased role with gusto, and Dickinson does well as her dashing beau. Pfeiffer is effervescent as ever, and director Joachim Ronning (replacing Robert Stromberg) keeps the pace up. Best of all, returning screenwriter Linda Woolverton (this time assisted by Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster) completes Maleficent's character arc from the first movie and leaves the door open for a sequel without requiring it. While a rushed second half prevents some plot points from being fleshed out, a strong finale ties everything together without overstaying its welcome.Maleficent: Mistress of Evil builds upon a good foundation with stronger action, a more confident script, and occasional humor that should entertain kids and fantasy fans alike. Please See it.Rated PG for Intense Sequences of Fantasy Action/Violence and Brief Scary Images",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
271,misel982001,"Bellow expectations, the usual thing for a commercial sequel",4,16 October 2019,"Despite the marketing campaign, this sequel does not prove itself to be the exception to the rule; that is, almost no sequel is better in any terms than the original film. To begin with, despite the superb cast and good acting, the film as a whole lacks the imagination and the atmosphere of the original. The story is evidently weak while the script at times seems to be full of plot holes like it has been hastily written. The evolvement of the story is easily predictable while the budget of this film manages to cover many of the plot holes. Of course there is no doubt that this film will be a commercial success but to my humble opinion it fails to repeat even at the slightest degree, the feeling of the original film.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

275,u-86036,Disruption and innovation,6,24 March 2020,"It's a film about subversion, where maleficent replaces the princess as the absolute protagonist, and the king replaces Maleficent as the ultimate villain, a kind of subversion. Also, in the plot, the king becomes maleficent's first love, then betrays her by ambition and power, thus sowing the curse of sleep, which is also a kind of subversion. The biggest twist is that maleficent is the one who cast the curse, but also the one who lifted it. True Love's kiss is no longer just the love between a man and a woman, but a great love, including affection, friendship and kinship. A kiss subverts a fairy tale.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

277,sugar_n_spice_makes_ever,& beyond the fairytale we went!,10,11 November 2019,"I'm just going to jump straight in.... I was ABSOLUTELY THRILLED with Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil. First off, I'd like to point out that the visual and CGI effects were breathtaking; couldn't have asked for anything more beautifully put together; stole me as soon as the movie opened. The story itself is predictable, but not in the way of it being tedious to watch. I liked that it was a lot darker than the first, that definitely had my attention! It had far more edge to it than the previous one. There were many moments that caught me gasping in shock, and I believe I welled up at least 5 times! Angelina as Maleficent is so stunning, I genuinely can't get over how she's mastered her character; the looks, the personality trait etc. Angelina Jolie literally has us under her own spell; she is mesmerising! Maleficent is completely misunderstood. This is the purpose of the movie; if you're different in many ways to others, people don't want to know, they fear the unknown. All they need is one person in charge or who has a higher authority to them, to then spread vile rumours or manipulate a situation which Maleficent, unfortunately, is / been part of, & this instantly results in her being the villain. This movie hits the nail right on the head with its storytelling. I love how Maleficent has many layers to her; she is unsure of the world and it's people, but she's also curious and wants to believe there is good and kindness, and this is all thanks to Aurora, but it seems that she can not escape the taunts of who she ""really"" is (by the perspective of others) Michelle Pfeiffer as Queen Ingrith was highly enjoyable to watch; as much as her wicked streak. As for Elle Fanning as Princess Aurora, she is the definition of grace. She's so perfect for the role. Her performance during the end (I won't say what part) was so astonishing. I wasn't expecting it but it had me chocking up whilst watching her have her moment, the writers / directors sure did succeed to this.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
278,Ritchie07,"It's always a treat to see Angelina, but ultimately disappointing",5,18 October 2019,"This was by no means an awful movie. I didn't hate it... but I definitely wouldn't say I liked it very much either. And I'm a HUGE Angelina fan and was excited all day yesterday to see her again on the big screen. After sleeping on it, I can confirm I'm very disappointed. I can't help but feel like an excellent cast (especially the women) was pretty wasted, though evil queen Ingrid (Michelle Pfeiffer) vs Maleficent was fun to watch-during the fleeting moments they were on screen together.The film was way too busy with too much going on. Too many subplots, way too much cgi, way too little Angelina. It certainly wasn't as impactful or fun to watch as the first one, despite the fact that this sequel definitely felt more expensive. I agree with some of the critics who stated this film is trying to be a sort of ""game of thrones for kids.""Angelina is always amazing and a treat to watch, but she didn't seem as into it (/enjoying herself/trying as hard) this time around. If you need proof of that, after watching this film, go on YouTube and watch the scene from the original Maleficent when she curses the baby. She's such an amazing presence in that scene, chewing the scenery beautifully. There is none of that here.This film is a perfect example of the fact that sometimes less can be a lot more, in my opinion.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

280,shay-67903,they tried to do too much and in the end came out flat and childish,6,19 October 2019,"So this movie is
Avatar meets the first movie,
meets a more childish version of the first movie,
meets a very misleading title of the movie.they are taking 4, 5 different story arcs and combining them into one childish movie and it makes for a bit flat movie for adults.first of all they are taking the story of the birth of maleficent and the fae world. instead of staying there and showing all that u could, u get a 10 minutes scene about that amazing world of them that u really do want to hear more. and then ur jumping to the castle .then you have the conflicts between the swamp lands and Michelle Fifer who wants to take them away and all the swamp creatures and aurora that's trying to rule there and the difficulties of ruling, and also on that u want to hear more.then you have the love story between aurora and the prince which looks like a super flat character like hies father. that's a love story i didn't buy as there is not too much chemistry between aurora and the prince.then you have the last fight wich only lasts 3, 4, minutes ... and you again would want it to last a lot more. and includes magicaly disappearing creatures and a firework of red smoke that turns them into flowers...
i'ts something that fits the smurphs movie... not a movie that grownups could watch.which leads me to the 2nd point.
it's really made for kids this time.i mean arguably it's a kids movie to start with. but i mean this time they raised the bar to more childish.first of all all the creatures turns to flowers when they hit that red firework smoke... and that's pretty much the only violence happening in the movie.
there isn't an ounch of darkness
and u would expect from a movie that calls itself ""mistress of evil"" to have a bit of darkness.
so mind that it's more childish in a lot of aspects.lastly and here is a huge spoiler.
when maleficent turns into the dark fae in the end.
that could have been amazing, if the dark fae would look anything other then just a big black bird... i mean in the swamp lands there are alot of big creatures. so couldn't they do like a black fog around here
or make it more menacing, more big, more epic..
no .. they couldn't
bcz it's a kids' movie and they got to keep it more simple,
so that's another wasted potential.in the end they tried to cramp in 5 different storylines, that each one of them could have been epic, but all came out flat and with very little screen time for each, and then the payoff for all of that was flat and disappointing.i'd give this movie a 6 because obviously they will do a third one, and will explore the fae world in that one, i just wish they would do it on this.also one more thing.
When maleficent is in the fae world u see her with her hair out and the horns out also,
meaning she actually collects her hair into the black thing that she wares.
i wish by far she would stay like that
because in that shot she ACTUALLY LOOKED like a dark ferry.
and i have no idea why Maleficent is wearing that black thing to cover her hair maybe it's just how the kids need to see her to remember her better..

299,darthmorbyva,Almost Great,8,30 October 2019,It's probably nitpicking but I could have found this movie as one of the best movies of the year if it wasn't for the obvious predictable storytelling that could have been made less predictable with the exclusion of one scene.That scene being the Queen walking through her secret dungeon and all the revelations it provides way too early. If it wasn't for this scene the rest of the movie would play out somewhat mysteriously until things are slowly peeled back instead of spending most of the movie already knowing everything.But the cast is good and I did enjoy the story. I just wish the filmmakers would have shown some restraint.,Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
300,phatworld,"Genocide is very bad, this movie is not very good",4,19 November 2019,I know I'm not the target audience and the goal is to take the person on an emotional rollercoaster. That being said I feel the swings from bad to good are senseless in a two hour movie. Something's are really bad and in a logical form of continuity in a story there should be a recovery period. This movie felt like it had an insane personality disorder to the point where I was very uncomfortably and would not suggest children see it for fear they might believe any great wrong is no bid deal.,Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

and it's brilliantIgnore the naysayers... the best thing they could produce is human waste.. and judging by some of the comments, they are overproducing and it's flowing through their mouths...great effects, great cast, great production and Angelina SLAYS as ever...Watch it, again and again..I will be ..",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
302,DragonLover1999,Best sequel for the Maleficent movie and Disney fans,9,3 March 2020,"I love this movie because it shows the continuing of Princess Aurora and Prince Philip getting together and planning on getting married, except the actor of Philip is different. I also love the part when Maleficent found the creatures that looked just like her. They're called ""Dark Fey"", which are another type of fairies. The craziest part about this movie is when the queen, who hates magical creatures, was building an army, who are creating weapons such as iron and red powder that could wipe out the Dark Fey and other magical creatures. Overall, this movie was great because it mainly shows that Maleficent's not the only fairy with bird wings anymore.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

The second continues the previous story, comparing kindness and peace with extremes and selfishness, and of course, it can also grasp the theme of harmonious coexistence between man and nature. But some of them I think are forcibly good. At least I think that people like the queen who have been so bad that they would not hesitate to commit genocide will have a very good ending when they become goats.

Angelina Jolie, Maleficent design was amazing but on the contrary, the rest of her species CGI look really fall out of place. Love the bird man nest, you can see different season and how different are the and love when they fly to the sky and skid the terrain.I have to admit I really like Angelina Jolie, this role is perfect for her, sort of anti-hero. The interaction between here and Michelle is also amazing, you can cut the tension with a knife in the first meetup scene, so good. But the villain herself, Michelle Pfeiffer, despite her acting was pretty good,I just can't get over her plastic filled upper lip and botox eyebrows, so goddam distracting.the script is not very good but somehow I don't care even a little bit. Overall, I really enjoy this film, just like the first one.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
309,dragon3611,Extremely Disappointing,5,6 June 2020,"First off, please ignore all the 1 out of 10s and the 10 out of 10s as this is not the worst movie ever made and neither is it the best.
Now let me first say that I was a huge fan of the first film, everything about it was amazing, the story, the casting, the visuals, the lot. A beautiful beautiful film that carved itself a special place in my heart - and that is a rare thing especially in modern times.
This time around it seems the idea was, lets take the opportunity to push a heavily politically correct storyline ( lots of diverse peoples fighting then getting along in harmony at the end ) run a weak story through the middle of it and mix in loads of CGI. There you go, open the theatre doors and wait for the money.
It's of those films that should have been left alone, to improve on the first was a herculean task - they were on to a loser from the start with this writer - if they had put as much effort into the actual story as they had in pushing the political agenda it may have been worth watching - sadly true of many movies nowadays.
Feel a bit sick in my stomach at the moment, like an old friend has let me down.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

315,red_jacket0707,2 hours of your life you'll never get back,1,23 October 2019,"I'm very open to family films and I thought the first Maleficent had a real edgy darkness to it that was very accessible to adults, so I was excited to see how they would develop a sequel.
What has been created however, is an absolute mess of a film. I'd like to say there are spoilers in this review, but seeing as there is absolutely zero plot, you don't need to worry about anything being spoiled. Oh but yeah these are spoilers if you actually wanna waste your time with this rubbish.
Here are some highlights:
Sonic the hedgehog falls in love with Toad from Super Mario Bros.Hagrid wants his Hippogryph backNo one can actAurora is annoyingEveryone forgets that Willow from Willow developed a weapon of mass destruction that killed countless fairies and they all become friends.A fairy gets turned into a flower but still has magic powers or somethingThere are loads of fairies trapped in a church and one stupid human gassing them all. THEY CAN FLY! just go and stop her doing it.Maleficent gives a cheeky wink about a christening. Ooh matron!Maleficent absorbs some power from another fairy like her when he is dying or something, and then becomes a phoenix or some nonsense and then everyone stops hating her and she turns the bad queen into a goat. LOL.Philip bless him, he can't act for toffee.Other than all of this, absolutely nothing happens.I would have thought that Angelina Jolie would have some clout to change the script, and surely she would have looked at it and thought, ""Eh?""
Abysmal.
I had fun on my reclining chairs and rolling my eyes at all the hammy ""you're my mummy"" sickness.
Avoid.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
316,monkykid28,Good graphics,3,22 October 2019,First question why did we need another malificent movie. Last movie was a telling about how really the villian was the hero. Which is fine there are a lot of those types of movies out there. But they don't do sequels to them. Now with that said this was plot was interesting making the queen the villian. Though I want point out so many thing that are wrong with this movie. First you have the dinner who is put to sleep well the king. Ok so what happens the next day they have a wedding. Not they go to war with the queen of Moors who is malificent. No they get ready for a wedding and nobody bats an eye. Next issue is Philips mom express passive aggressively her dislike for anything that has to do with the moors and fairy's. Lastly the announce that every resident of the moor are required to come to the wedding. All red flags that the moors princess should be able to pick up on but doesn't even allow a thought to cross her mind she only thinks of the wedding and her God mother. These events were why I struggled to enjoy the movie it seemed like everybody were as oblivious as a blind deaf person would be to these events. Though the climax was super cool and the evil queen was probably one of the best tacticians id seen in a long time the way she defended and attacked against her enemy was so creative. As well I enjoyed seeing the computer animated creatures and world it was also supper cool but hero's should have been able to notice something was off at the least,Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

323,ventery,Enchanting on so many levels!,9,2 December 2019,"I was very excited when I found out that they were working on a second Maleficent film and could not wait to see it. Luckily, I had the chance to view this amazing film on the very last day of its airing at the cinema and I am very happy I did.To start off, I would like to comment on the set and costume design. As with the first film, the set and costume design in 'Maleficent: Mistress of Evil' was beautifully executed and completely enchanting, so much so that it felt as if I was viewing the film in a fantasy world. As for the CGI effects, they were nothing but flawless. The cute little fairytale creatures and even the fighting scenes were beautifully done.Furthermore, the choice of acting talent in this film (as with its predecessor) was perfect. There were many familiar faces such as the beautiful Elle Fanning who reprised her role as Aurora, Angelina Jolie as the mistress of evil, Maleficent as well as her faithful servant, Deval, played by Sam Riley. Fanning and Jolie make a stunning pair on screen. Their portrayal of 'mother and daughter' was flawless as was Jolie's portrayal of Maleficent's inner struggle with herself as magical creature and her love for Aurora.Surprising and expertly executed was the addition of new cast members. Michelle Pfeiffer was brilliant in her role as Queen Ingrith. Pfeiffer brought an extra level of resentment and coldness to her performance which made Queen Ingrith even more convincing and evil. Another new addition worth mentioning is Harris Dickinson as Prince Philip. While Brenton Thwaites was a great Prince Philip in the first installment, I felt Dickinson somehow did it better and would have preferred him in the first film.All in all, I enjoyed the film very much. The actors did a fantastic job at keeping their audience interested and it was a great choice of distraction from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. As for the themes, they too were expertly executed as we got to see a little more of the complex, yet tragic nature that is Maleficent. I definitely recommend this to anyone who wishes to escape from life for a while.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
324,siljethomsen,it is worth a watch,9,20 October 2019,This movie is really good. The acting is amazing. This movie might be better than the first one. I was a bit hessetant at first but now i will watch it again.,Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

328,b2280545,An excellent sequel,9,22 October 2019,"2014's Maleficient was an excellent film that unfortunately was not a critical success. It was a nice fresh new twist on the 1959 Disney classic animated film, Angelina Jolie gave an outstanding performance as the title character, it had beautiful fantasy and visuals, it had so much heart and gold in it and it is one of the better Disney live-action remakes. However, as of late, the Disney live-action remakes have not been anything short of amazing but have been stilted and wooden and being stripped of the magic and fun of the classic animated films. So the fact that they made a sequel to this film sounded strange and felt at first unnecessary. It was fantastic.This film takes the character of Maleficient and again explores her humanity to even deeper levels than it did in the first film. Aurora played by Elle Fanning is engaged to Prince Phillip and his parents the King and Queen invite her and Maleficient to celebrate the wedding. However, when they arrive at Prince Phillip's kingdom, they uncover a diabolical plot to eliminate Maleficient's magical world. This film sadly has a low score of 41% on Rotten Tomatoes and 43% on Metacritic from critics and I cannot understand why. There is so much to love about this film especially if you were a fan of the first film. Firstly, it is a beautiful looking film. It captures the magic and wonder of the animated film as well as what you'd normally expect from a film made from Disney. The castles, the forests, the creatures, everything looks like a beautiful Disney film. The performances are really great. Angelina Jolie again as Maleficient delivers as the Mistress of Evil. I cannot picture anybody else playing this character. She is Maleficient straight out of the animated film. She is both creepy as well as sympathetic for this portrayal as she is portrayed as an anti-hero than full on villainy which is a great twist on the character. Elle Fanning was great as Aurora and the chemistry she shares with Jolie on screen is wonderful and tugs at your heart strings many times throughout. Michelle Pfeiffer is great as the Queen, Prince Phillip's mother. An actress as famous and successful as Pfeiffer, she steals every scene she has in the film. She delivers without flaw. Such a great actress.By far, the only disappointment I had with this film was they didn't bring back the actor who played Prince Phillip from the first Maleficient. The actor who replaces him does a fine job but it's still disappointing he did not return. Other than that, it was a really good sequel. It exceeded my expectations and am satisfied with the final product. If you were a fan of the first Maleficient, you'll definitely like this film. There is so much heart and moments that touch you, your eyes will likely tear up. It was a really great film, go see it for yourself.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
329,fishwicke,Great movie,10,3 January 2020,"I wasn't expecting the second of these films to be so good but it didn't disappoint. So much going on, great effects & we see a much more heart warming maleficent. They've done a great job of letting us see more deeply into this character. You really can't help but fall in love with all the wonderful magical beings that you feel surrounded by throughout this movie. An absolute must see for anyone. Michelle Pfeiffer adds a great touch & does not fail to impress. Great film.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

332,brep91,Probably better than the first,9,24 October 2019,"Yes the story line is very predicable because hey, it's Disney. I knew how 95% of the movie would play out just by watching 1 trailer. With that being said, the acting and special effects makes for a fun, entertaining ride. I don't get the bad reviews unless you're just expecting a groundbreaking work of art, which it isn't & that's okay.The film lagged a bit here and there but the reason I would venture to say it's better than the first is because where the first Maleficent stayed in tune with the main theme of Sleeping Beauty (aside from obvious examples), this movie implemented more experiences that many of us come across in our own lives, particularly judgement, changing ourselves to fit in, and exclusion/discrimination of various degrees. This is one I will definitely watch again.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

2) magical tears all of a sudden resurrect the dead?

More than 4 years, the audience was waiting for the release of the picture. But their hopes, unfortunately, are in no hurry to be justified.The familiar cast (Angelina Jolie, Elle fanning, Sam Riley) was joined by Michelle Pfeiffer, Chiwetel Ejiofor, ed Skrein and others. Their impressive existence in the characters is better perceived apart from the whole picture. In light of the fact that any work of art is always conceived for a holistic perception, this is not the most pleasant fact.

The cast is strong, and the performances are equally so. I think the idea of Maleficent's kind - fairies - should've received more attention and does deserve a dedicated movie of its own, as it sounds as a rich, interesting world with great potential for charming presentations and worthy plots - rather than being used as a side aspect to another main line the way it is in this movie. Overall, the movie is fine and I think that it, though not by much, deserves more than the flat 7 it's got here on IMDB so far at the time of this review.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

When did Maleficent grow fangs and have trouble speaking because of them. When did Aurora become so annoying. When did Diaval become so pointless. The film is called Maleficent, mistress of evil yet she isn't anything even remotely close to evil.

But as I said on the headline, they really shouldn't put war and genocide into a movie which they want to keep child-watchable. The end result is a silly story which makes your eyes roll to the back of your head.For starter, they show us a whole lot of birdmen, who were driven into the danger of extinction and live in seclusion of by humans? How can these birdmen forgive the humans so readily??Second, it's a war, but the birdmen don't bring any weapons with them and we don't see any humans getting mauled or bleed to death. We don't see any birdmen die horribly too, even though the humans have firearms, instead these lot of birdmen  disappear in a firework. None of them are mourned too until the end of the movie. You call this a war scene?Third, the fairies are in danger of being wiped out in a genocide. In fact, a lot of their precious life long friends died. But an hour later, they stand side by side with the humans, clap hands and cheer.I see that you really want this movie to be an all age movie. if so then you should have chosen some other kind of conflict. They really should fire the writer.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

356,fairhaven,Loved it...,10,30 October 2019,"First of all, both movies were good, but I've looked forward to seeing Michelle and Angelina together in a movie. They did not disappoint. It had a really good message with the daughter and mother relationship. It was worth the wait from the first movie. The first movie and this one, esp this one showed redemption, of how a person can change and learn from their mistakes. When you leave the theatre you'll feel satisfied with how it turned out. The cast did really good, esp Angelina, Michelle, and Elle.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
357,nonficshaun,It looked neat for a minute.,2,19 January 2020,"Horrible one-liners are the territory of Stalone and Schwarzenegger, but all we get from Jolie is fractured sentences except for the first dinner where she was at least conversing with Pfeifer. I liked the twist on the story from the first movie, but this was more like putting the story through the ringer and peppering throwbacks into the holes.
As for the other reviews about heartless characters and poor role models, I completely agree for once. It's like they were saying all you have to do is be corney and optomistic and all crimes...up to murder...can be overlooked so we can be buddies. No death in the movie meant anything and there was no remorse or recompense. Even Maleficent's choice at the end meant zip. She knocks down a tower...will you walk me down the aisle real quick? My mom is a goat....meh. Deap people and fairy tale folk scattered about...let's get hitched! I must watch Pulp Fiction to get my moral compass aligned again.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

359,Swanson87,Stunning movie with a big battle based on nothing,6,21 October 2019,"I knew this film would be better than the first one. In this case there was no original story to ruin..........However, there are some wtf things. First of all, the ""mistress of evil"" has absolutely no evil in her. She simply reacts in a more than understandable way to the provocations of Queen Ingrid (Michelle Pfeiffer). So, Disney, since we had already established from the first movie that Maleficent is a tender kitten at heart, why do you continue to make us believe that she is this diabolical creature? What kind of hoax is it supposed to be? The real mistress of evil is Queen Ingrid, ok ok, but it still is a silly trick. Anyway, the real problem of this movie is Queen Ingrid. She has no believable motivation to be so resentful of the fairy world. It's a little funny: she's married to a sweet husband, she gave birth to a good and kind son, and then... then she is a devious bitch who wants to destroy the fairy world. Why? Because her brother was killed? Because she thinks the human realm is threatened by fairies? Not quite so. She's not portrayed as a real defender of humans, she's simply portrayed as a bad sadistic woman. So the whole battle is based on nothing. We all know that Disney cartoons are full of villains with no rational motivations. However I always expect something more believable in a live action movie.Having said that, this film is visually very beautiful. It does its job: it entertains the public with spectacular action scenes, with really well-chosen character designs and then... HER. The real deal of this film: Angelina Jolie. She's hypnotic. I was amazed from start to end by her makeup, her outfits, her eyes. Absolutely wonderful.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

All I believe this just a show that a princess who cannot even hold her passion to marry the prince. While AJ shows great character, but others seem so weak.

370,eaglescout910,It's Great for a Sequel,8,19 October 2019,"The pacing of the film was great with the exception of the initial scene with Aurora feeling a little too drawn out.
Michelle Pfeiffer, Angelina Jolie, and Elle Fanning were outstanding in their roles and really made this film great. It had some interesting twists that at times felt a little cliche, but hey it's a Disney film that's still trying to cater to kids - or at least families (and Disney knows how to use a formula that works).
It was nice to see a sequel that actually had some thought put into it and had actors/actresses that seemed really invested in it. Supporting actors and characters also brought great performances that helped carry the story along.
Overall, I'm just happy they put real effort into this film, the actors cared about how it would turn out, and it puts yet another creative spin on the story of Maleficent that isn't like the cartoon version that came before it.A sequel that doesn't make you feel like you wasted your time and money and provides a great follow up story to the original, albeit with some cliches. But hey, don't most Disney films have cliches?",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

My only complaints are the title is very misleading. Surely the ""Mistress of Evil"" can do more than just turn someone into a goat. We also didn't get clarification on why maleficent was pretty much exiled and left thinking she was the last of her kind. What happened the reason why they left Maleficent at the moors? Lastly, the dragged out starring instead of taking action. Other than that truly beautiful!",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

Yes it was a typical humans vs. creatures thing but I'm a sucker for great special effects movies and in that respect it was superb. Might be a bit frightening for real little ones but the kids will enjoy it.

I thought that this was a great sequel, especially with the important topics like racism and being parental figures. My favorite part was when Maleficent was protecting Aurora by getting shot for her, although she makes it in the end, it was still a great scene as it shows how much Aurora means to her personally.I also loved the fact that it was discussing racism between the faerie and human kinds. I couldn't help, but notice that this important topic in the movie. Although Disney tries to hide this sort of thing in their movies, I feel like it is important to show some form of reality without showing too much it.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

Angelina Jolie is the best thing about the movie but both her and Michelle Pfeiffer have nothing to do while Fanning utilisés her one look of distress through the whole film( could she be more annoying) A postage stamp sized story is stretched over to hours which feels like an eternity when you just want it to end.

385,mrshollywoodsy,Critics got this one wrong. Go see it!,9,23 October 2019,"I was excited for this movie the second the trailer dropped. It looked incredible, and seeing it in theaters, it did not disappoint. Ever since Disney started their live-action track, most of those films have been lack-luster, B-rated movies. Maleficent is everything but that. It actually breathes new life into its characters. It keeps you on the edge of your seat even though you have a fairly good idea what is going to happen. The acting doesn't feel dry, the CGI is incredibly beautiful, the story flows nicely. You just need a black bow to wrap up this movie because it all just works -- which is surprising for a sequel!I don't know what the critics are talking about. Does this movie involve political talk? Yeah, sure. Is the love story on the back burner and mostly used as a plot device? Yep. But this movie isn't about Aurora and Philip, and we can't exactly expect automatic peace just because the first film ended on a happy note. Maleficent is supposed to be a villain even if the true story behind her is that she's only evil because her story was told wrong. That's what the movie is about! Don't go into Maleficent if you're expecting Sleeping Beauty. I think you know that's not what you're going to get.This was a great sequel to the first one released back in 2014. The two main actresses slid right back into their characters, and as expected, Michelle Pfeiffer did a fantastic job as the real villain. Go see this movie. It's worth the price of admission and more.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

389,DmytroBaker,Complicated tale.,8,10 November 2019,"A beautiful beginning with offscreen text, magical creatures and bright colors - everything is so cute, familiar, warm. The film - like a kind mother - hugs after a long separation and instantly gently reminds us of why we once fell in love with it. We meet Aurora, Philip, who this time was pleasantly surprised by the presence of character and no storyline, Maleficent... and her inimitable cheekbones. During the time that has passed since the first film, I managed to forget how sharp her cheekbones are, as if someone had inserted bank cards in her mouth, or brought the bones out practically. Probably, it should look beautiful, but to me these cheekbones cut the eye of the whole film. Although, this is a personal nit-picking, but the film has problems and is more serious than cheekbones.In particular, this is an unbalanced story. Without going into details, the authors swung on a serious topic in the spirit of the «Game of Thrones», but already bringing it to the peak as if they suddenly remembered that they had a children's fairy tale here, and quickly reduced everything to a good ending. Children may be happy, but my result was a slight dissonance and nostalgic sadness. As the character Michelle Pfeiffer said, miracles happen only in fairy tales. And the authors, having forgotten, brought too much of life into the fairy tale. And if the first film really was a fairy tale story, finished and magical, not requiring continuation, then from the second it is quite possible to develop a third, and further - there are plenty of premises for conflicts.In general, despite the obvious vivid beauty of the film, there are many frank plot holes (which, moreover, the characters themselves point to!), Awkward and subordinate moments to the letter of the plot. But a lot of beautiful things. As one of the reviews above correctly said, you just need to decide for yourself what you want to see: the storyline, a colorful magical world, familiar characters. I wanted to see Maleficent and that fairy magic that fills her world. I saw it.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

While the landscapes were first rate, I found the average Marvel movie has more wit and creativity in ten minutes of dialogue than this movie had in total. So, as a movie goes for me, it was tolerable because of the visuals. The plot also didn't actually shed any light on Maleficent's backstory despite the obvious potential to do so..and I will avoid any spoilers.

The whole conflict of the first movie is maleficent trying to break the curse which she cannot until she realizes she is the true love.

Robert did yet another amazing job pulling this together. Great CGI, outstanding cenimatography, incredible costumes, fascinating Acting (I mean the definition of an actress was the Lead) and of course a trilling assemblage.But my major problem with this Fantasy marvel is indeed with the story and as a writer I understand how elusive it can be to craft an entire sequel without an actual source material for adaptation but based off already existing characters and an exhausted tale. The result is always a mount full of plot holes, new character development constraints and a risk to undo a good job.I was literally excited to see my all time favorite hero-villain only rivalled by the Dark Knight in all her glory and insanely gripping one liners but I just couldn't get my head off how bad the story was. I was also excited to see Candall played by the prolific Chiwetel who could match Maleficent's Evil for Evil only for the character to be underdeveloped and killed off cheaply.If this ever returns for a third installment, please do better.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

It's simply magical. Michelle Pfeiffer kills it as the evil Queen Ingrith in a way that just makes you hate her guts. The only negatives I would remark on is the dramatic and abrupt change in tone after the war scene. It doesn't fit well going into the final act (seeming shoe-horned in). Especially considering the queens high treason and war crimes where she gets off basically scott-free and where her and the other's misdeeds are quickly pardoned and forgotten about.

416,Burgess_Kris,Too Much,6,3 January 2020,Whilst I enjoyed the first movie and was looking forward to this one; I've come away disappointed. It looks glorious but it seems so hollow - I had little care about any of the characters and therefore didn't engage. By the end part of the film; it was clear they'd tried to cram too much into it and rushed everything asking us to overlook it all so it could have a very standard fairytale ending.,Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
417,k-s-e-n-i-y-a,Amazing movie!,10,18 October 2019,"Movie is amazing! Dont listen to the negative reviews. I dont know why the rating is so low for this movie, but the movie is 10/10. Great acting, props & direction. Go see it, you wont be disappointed!!",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
418,calvinc1203,I could not roll my eyes back any further,3,11 December 2019,"So basically, Michelle Pfeiffer gets to do whatever she wants (including biological warfare/genocide) with no consequence, and we should all be unreasonably forgiving.I just don't understand how her character's able to F everyone over and over again! Aurora does nothing but cries and pretends to be useful, the prince is...just a prince, and maleficent barely manages to save the day at the cost of (a whole lot of) magical creatures' lives because she arrives late, gets killed for basically no reason, reborn (yes, you read right), seemingly re-saves the day yet unable to undo any death, turns the castle ""flowery"" and everybody rejoice! Hug your enemies (never mind that the blue fairy is now just a pot of flower and half of the near-extinct dark feys are gone)!I literally cringed the entire 2/3 of the movie because of how oblivious everyone is; it's like nobody gives a damn about what just happened. Probably hundreds of innocents were killed, but the perpetrator is now a goat, ha ha! Most of the so-called ""plot"" is laughable like that unfunny goat, with tropes, played out conveniences, and forced romances:1. The whole ""We dark feys have been hiding here (less than an hour away)"" is like a less convincing rerun of How to Train Your Dragon.
2. Maleficent realizes her ""Phoenix force"" after a Black man sacrifices himself, resulting in her flirting with the reckless White boy who is still alive.
3. One of the human soldiers (who did the most killings) checks out the rainforest-fey lady (10 minutes after her partner got killed)...She likes it and reciprocates.This movie leaves a really bad taste in my mouth; the ending is so forced and everybody is so blatantly happy despite the tragedy-makes me wanna puke all over Disney.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
419,iam_ahardrockers,DIsney goes Game of Thrones,8,16 October 2019,"Loving the departure from the boring first movie, because this one punched more actions (PG of course) better and with more lovely mythical creatures.Great set designs, costumes, and cinematography albeit bit boring in the middle and finale.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
420,agnes_beibi,This was a beautiful movie but the story didn't make sense.,6,27 October 2019,"Sorry but this movie was all over the place.
Me and my friends all agreed that this was a beautiful movie the scenery was great, specifically the affects, but the story was all over the place. The movie took way to long to start and then when it did it was bad I was always waiting for things to become better, but it never did. Aurora was such annoying character, she is so unlikeable. That prince had really bad storylines and his acting was bad.
I agree with some of the comments, talking about Disney trying to go game of Thrones.
That just didn't fit the movie.
I'm only giving this movie a 6 because of Angelina and Michelle. They did a good job, it's not they're fault that the directors went overboard.The first movie was good, I would definitely like to see a number 3 movie, maybe they will try to make a better story next time.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
421,jadiepie-06795,Underwhelming,6,10 November 2019,"The trailers for this were amazing and made me super excited for it but unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype.
Pros
Acting in general is very good.The costumes in it are so beautiful and anyone who likes fashion or costumes should watch.last half an hour is a pretty decent watchCons
The Villian in this is so cringey. There are times she is being so obviously villianous and people just seem to not notice. At some points she was obviously being horrible towards Maleficent and the other characters just seemed to get annoyed at Maleficent for reacting?Story is meh.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
422,mjrusso-30081,Angelina kills it again,10,28 January 2020,I thought it was a really good sequel. I personally loved the first one and thought this was a step forward. Just the colors and CGI of the creatures was quite stunning. Angelina killed it again as maleficent. Just how she reacted and how protective she was being is really inspiring. The makeup/costumes were absolutely gorgeous. I hope they win the Oscar for it. I'll reiterate that Angie makes this movie!,Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

Also Angelina Jolie and Michelle Pfeiffer in one movie, haven't we all been waiting for that? And upcoming star Elle Fanning showed a soft nevertheless badass Aurora... It's just a shame Brenton Thwaites (prince Philip) couldn't be in it...",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
425,ludwing-42928,I love youuu Elle Fanning,10,7 April 2020,What I liked most about this movie is seeing her beautiful face of Elle .... the best,Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
426,ldickinson-1,Maleficent and the Mistresses of Evil,8,6 December 2019,"Wow! The story line picks up five years after the first Maleficent ends and builds around Queen Aurora and Prince Philip deciding to take their relationship to a new level. What I didn't understand at first was why the long narrative during the opening credits to explain why everyone still fears Maleficent.
The very first scene with hardly any spoken dialogue made it very clear why humans mistrust the fair folk of the Moors and why same fair folk propose crushing all humans. But wait, that silhouetted horned winged-creature who I at first took to be Maleficent, isn't Maleficent! At least unless she's taken to wearing baggy shorts. Watch closely. Ah, now the narrative makes sense and ties into a speech Queen Ingrith makes to Queen Aurora towards the end of the movie.
Angelina Jolie, Elle Fanning, Sam Riley, and Michelle Pfeiffer were just brilliant. Maleficent is at the dead center of all the most interesting and hilarious conversation between these four. The interaction between her and Aurora either has you laughing or unable to stop the tears. I can't imagine a better Aurora than Elle Fanning. Harris Dickinson as Prince Philip is slowly growing on me, but he never seems to portray that inability to stop smiling when in the presence of Aurora that was done so well by Brenton Thwaites in the first movie. I suspect this has more to do with the writing and direction than Dickinson's acting ability but if that is the case, the writers missed something that was very sweet about the relationship between Aurora and Philip.
And finally, Michelle Pfeiffer as Ingrith. I hate to give another spoiler, but this movie should have been called not Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, but instead Maleficent and the Mistress of Evil. Though you could easily add Jenn Murry as Gerda and call it Maleficent and the Mistresses of Evil. You'll want to spit on them every time you see them.
Special props to Angelina Jolie, Elle Fanning, and Ed Skrein as Borra. These three have whole scenes in which they say not a word, but you know exactly what they are saying and feeling just from their expressions, body language, and their eyes-especially the eyes.
And get ready for a few new characters and creatures introduced to the plot that are just begging for further back story, none more so than Pinto, a small hedgehog-like Denison of the Moors who is obviously one of Aurora's best friends and fiercely loyal allies. She is seen throughout much of the movie and yet one wishes there were more interaction between Pinto and Aurora. They seem to just keep missing each other.
On an artistic note, it is difficult to see a movie now days in a format other than 2D digital. By working really hard, I was able to see Maleficent: Mistress of Evil three times in 3D and twice in Imax before those formats left the big screen forever. Why oh why don't they make Imax 3D anymore? That was the ultimate. The next hardest thing is to get the movie makers to release 3D movies in 3D blu-ray format for home viewing. And as far as I can tell, no one streams in 3D anymore. Fortunately, Amazon UK is taking preorders for Maleficent: Mistress of Evil in 3D blu-ray format. Hopefully they get enough preorders that Disney will make a true 3D blu-ray release instead of just a 2D conversion to 3D. Why do movie companies do that anyway? Don't they know that any 3D TV can do that conversion with any show and any DVD? Don't they know that a conversion is nowhere near as nice as real 3D and that even neophyte viewers as young as five years old can tell the difference?
Go see Maleficent. I hope there is another sequel and I hope there is more Pinto and more Aurora with maybe some major flashbacks. Come to think of it, there is five years' worth of Queen Aurora and Pinto stories that would make for a wonderful Disney plus TV series. Disney, is that your plan?",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

I watched the first one too, which was quite fascinating, so that's why I set high expectations before watching this part. Frankly speaking, the second part went even beyond the bar. Angelina Jolie, as always, was perfect. Basically, the main message was that hatred and wars would never fix the situation. The second message is that we should be forever grateful for nature and its wonders and never destroy it. Revenge is a trap that will absorb you until destruction.

The original Maleficent was a good twist on the original story (with it's own problems I grant you).This sequel to that is a further stretching of the original tale and very unessasary. The plot is slow and predictable with Maleficent's kind (breed) adding nothing new apart from being pretty annoying and predictable with their thirst for war.The acting is alright. Michelle Pfeiffer is pretty badass but even she, with her awesome costumes and lips, couldn't save this film for me.This film is nearly 2 hours of my life I won't get back. Please Disney, give us something original, worth our time and not a money making scheme!",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
457,allisonjx,Everything amazing but the script.,5,15 August 2021,"The actors/actresses were amazing, the character design was wonderful, the CGI was on point, and the costumes? Left me breathless. But the script??? What were they thinking.1. I couldn't even feel sorry for Aurora when she was pushed off that ledge by the Queen. She had so many chances to do it herself. Also, she decided that the best time to reignite her mother-daughter bond with Maleficent was to do it right in front of the person who was trying to murder her mother? Really? Can a person be THAT stupid and out of touch?2. Maleficent stopped in front of the death-trap chapel to give Aurora a long look, but didn't bother waving a hand to free her subjects from that pink glitter hell? If she could turn that raven into a raven-bear, then she could've just knocked the doors down herself with a wave of her hand instead of waiting for bird-bear man to do it. I really don't understand what the point of stalling it was.3. Missing plot point? I thought there was gonna be a moment where the Queen's missing and supposedly dead brother came back (I thought it was the raven man) but it seems like the writers forgot about it, or just wanted to give the Queen a reasonable motivation for wanting to take over the Moor? But since Aurora believed in her subjects' innocence, I thought the whole thing was gonna be a misunderstanding and the brother was still alive. Guess not then.4. Aurora really just held a wedding immediately after a genocide attempt on her people. The Queen literally got halfway there, but Aurora completely disregarded that and was like, anyway, who wants to see me get married? There were so many moments where Aurora's stupidity just left me shaking my head. I can't.5. This isn't really a criticism, but that place where the winged people were living? That ain't no cave. That's a whole underground country. How are there so many different temperature zones in one cave? I don't understand. Magic? But if all their powers involved plants, how/why are there snowy-winged people who lived without any plants around them?",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

But I like the idea which is the transformation of pixies and other creatures into flowers when they are dead. Overall, the plot is average and predictable but it is entartaining anyway.

471,macarongboyhiphop,My rating say it all,4,21 April 2020,"Writer: 1/10. It's not predictable story, it's dumb story. No character in the movie suppose react the way they did in the movie if their brain function that well.
Producer: 1/10. There are billions way to create drama, they choose the most stupid way to do it.
VFX: 5/10. Effect quite okay, except physics is so poor.
Acting: N/A, since the script is so poor and producer is bad, must be many confusing and awkward moments when the film is making. Therefore the actor and actress always look confusing rather than emotional they should emit.
Yep, the VFX save the day",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

477,annamaria-05953,Disappointing and weakening the first movie's message,1,17 November 2019,"Wow, what a slap in the face of the empowering women and feminism message of the first movie!1. Princess Aurora: A faithless airhead, incompetent ruler and heartless self-centered mannequin.2. Queen Ingrith: A way and means of having the movie's villain hurt the two female main characters without the public crying ""mysogyny!""3. Maleficent: Demoted to supporting character and rushed out of the way of the main plot relegated to ""finding herself"" among her newly discovered fellow winged-and-horned dark fae.So the majority of Maleficent's native race, already on the verge of dying out, got wiped out in one fell swoop. Plus - since supposedly all the Moor's population got trapped in the church and shot like fish in a barrel - a huge lot of them got taken out as well. Including one of Aurora's three ""aunties"". No matter, let's take the hands of the very people who reduced fairyland's population to a mere fraction of its original size and LET'S HAVE A WEDDING! We're now all friends here!What a trio of ""strong women"". Either pretty, self-centered and useless, or scheming and evil (and coming to no good end, of course).Thank you, Disney.

This film does neither justice.
The storyline is terrible, like a bad mash up of Avatar and Game of Thrones.
There is very little screen time from the actual character of the title and what there is, frankly, is not very good.
The only redeeming feature is Michelle Pfeiffer.

483,alisaadlerwl,The Missed Opportunity of the Great Idea,7,3 December 2019,"Sorry If I have some mistakes in the text, English is not my native.It wasn't easy to watch this film. Partly cause it lasts for almost 2 hours. Partly cause dame on the left was laughing almost permanently the whole time, despite of actions on the screen. And guy on the right was jumping in his chair. By the way, he left a huge puddle after him. I still hope it was some drink, not fright of the movie.Let's start from main heroes. As many too good heroes Aurora looked boring and false. There were no questions about actress's play, it was fine. But the personage... The same feeling I had about her betrothed Fillip, and his father the king. I had such a zero interest to that tame three, what I didn't worried at all about their lines. If in the end they would had been pricked by a spindle, I wouldn't be upset at all.Aurora is so kind, that she is ready to save even enemies. Even if doing this she risks live of her beloved. She is like an embodied kindness. She is ready to let down beloved to please the new relatives.Her behavior seems pretty controversial. Sometimes she shows an absence of shrewdness. Sometimes she tuns into Sherlock Holmes. And she has... a clairvoyance gift?..By the way, while the Moor Queen is becalming her Godmother, the prince Philip don't even try to becalm his wantoning provoker-mother. That scene I see as a hint, who is going to concede in the future family life. He asks to his betrothed stupid questions, what is going wrong, while even the five-years child in the cinema guessed what was wrong. And during the film he was a 'great' help to his girlfriend. In contrast to Devial, for example. The smarter girl would have questioned her decision to marry such a fine fellow. But it seems Aurora rush down the aisle. Maybe there are not many princess in that region... So she puts on a wedding dress even not giving herself time to mourn about her lost fiends...C - compassion.What unites these two heroes besides the status and hormones is a big secret for me. Maybe a secret was explained in the previous part - I've never seen it. And I was more impressed by the love-affair of the hedgehog and the Fly-agaric boy, really.But still, it's a fairy tale, and the happy end comes. But I believe that children who can accept such behavior as an example, should be explained: the life isn't a fairy-tale. And to help manipulators and abusers is not the best strategy ever.Maleficent. During the movie I learnt Maleficent had problems with smiling, she was irritable, loved Aurora, and... loved to dress and underwear to fight? Why the last thing is in the movie for children? And yes, she is easily moved. So she is nice. Generally I liked the personage. But I hadn't watched the first part, and didn't notice a good disclosure of the heroine on he second part. And as result didn't feel a strong interest to a heroine during the film. But at least Maleficent had changed during the movie (in contrast to other heroes...)The queen. The authoritative lady. She is intolerant to whose who differs from her. In my mind, this personage, as well as dark feys, is disclosed in the film not just through actions, but though words too. She explains her stance.The ginger servant of the queen. I believe that she shows the kind of behavior, which is typical for a person, who has a demonstrative character and a job which gives very few opportunities to express it. The hero is taciturn, flashy, eccentric. And interesting because of it.
Dark feys. They care about well-being of their people. They look sincere and it made me sympathize them. As distinct from Aurora, they are not good. They are not bad also. They are real. Their world has it's own atmosphere, and this picture makes compassionate their cheers and griefs. Their desire to give better future to children, give them freedom to live at any place in the world they want, instead of where they cannot he hurt. They have wisdom, willingness to search for decision, which is fine for everybody. They are ready to act to do it. Likely it would be a great and breathtaking movie, if dark feys would had got more screen time, not cutie Aurora. But alas. Alas.Moor creatures. They were most lovable for me. Honestly, I worried about them the most. They were sincere and simple-hearted like children. They were ready to risk their lives to save friends. In contrast to Aurora's kindness their kindness looks plausible, because they don't aspire to look too convenient or good. That awkward moment when second-order personages look more interesting than the main heroes.Generally, the film is made well. But I wouldn't watch it the second time soon, and would recommend to explain some moments to children.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
484,cakraludra,Family Drama with Great Effects and Poor Script,3,25 May 2020,"Prince Philip finally has a courage to propose Aurora. So, If you want to watch a great fictional wedding i recommend you to watch this movie. Just kidding. I rather rewatch The Big Bang Theory Season 11, Episode 24 over and over again.Take away the effects from this movie and all thats left is stupid family drama with a very bad script. Every characther is poorly developed. I tried my best to understand the reason behind every action that each characther takes. There's just no common sense.The ending is the worst. Is it have to be happy? I believe that no one is happy watching this ending.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
485,yosefmarchant,Brilliant,10,17 October 2019,"I have been waiting many years for this movie - after the first I just didn't know how they could top that in any way. They did.This movie has everything a good movie contains - action , suspense , great characters and acting , all topped of with an amazing edited flow that makes the movie a visual experience as well as an emotional one .Anjelina Jolie does an INCREDIBLE job as Maleficent is mistress of evil - she knows exactly how to play her in a way that doesn't make her too ""nice"" but at the same time vice versa. Elle also does a great job, I want to point out that although many people said that she is only good as her role because she looks good or has that ""sleeping beauty glow"" about her - I can infer that this is very untrue (as well as obviously those good ""sleeping beauty"" looks) she does a great job playing aroura . As for Michelle - I couldn't think of a better actress to play the evil queen , she has a sort of acting style about her in this movie which adds character and more. The male roles have a lesser part in the main movie but this has to do with the fact that the movie was meant to focus more on female roles. I do think though that the prince was a little more ""model"" than character at times ,but his role is minor and thus makes less difference in the movie.Along with these characters is a very interesting plot - without spoilers - the movie gives Maleficent a big choice - peace or war - this creates an amazing dialogue with great suspense and action scenes, whilst still having small humour kicks within .The movie ends off very surprisingly and unexpectedly but does so with a twist.On top of this the movie creates a plot that highlights so many important messages and morales for the whole family - trust, love, and peace .I would highly recommend watching this movie with the whole family , not only will it be thrilling and funny - but you will learn many things about life that can be transcribed into our own lives .",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
486,finsfall-42513,Read the book instead.,5,21 October 2019,"The movie was well cast, beautifully costumed, and featured amazing cgi, but the writers failed to find a unifying plot. The first act featured more of the character interaction that made the first movie interesting, culminating in the dinner party which is arguably the best part of the film. The second act falls apart as competing plot lines between family drama, war criticism, and genocide all try and fail to take precedence. Maleficent gets lost in the world building, and the movie ends in a large, rather pointless battle scene.If you want character depth/character interaction, read Holly Black's companion book to the film titled Heart of the Moors. It was everything that the movie could have been, but failed to achieve.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

488,oyasuna,Irredeemable,1,12 November 2019,"Does everyone love fairytales here?Well me too, but certainly not like this 😡You know.. after the release of the first movie, i heard a sequel was going to be out in theaters this year. I loved the first very much, i even gave it a nine out of ten. That was how magnificent it was, and now with this added to the franchise, i decided to go see it in theaters with my mom. As i left the venue, i sat in the car feeling empty. After i gave multiple chances for redemption to Disney, unfortunately this shows the company has officially sold out.The story is mediocre at best, the acting that saves the movie is only Sam Riley and Angelina Jolie reprising their respective roles from the previous film, even Aurora now strikes me as the whiny child who is incredibly dumb and selfish. Don't get me started on the Queen, by far the worst character i have seen in cinema for a long time. The character development is close to none even if the duration is two hours long, no build up and the action is not as great as i hoped it would be. Altough yes, it definitely is a pretty looking movie from the marvelous CGI, cinematography as well as excellent editing. However, those are just the beginning. Oh no, those are nothing compared to this aspect that i despised with all my heart, body and soul.It has the most atrocious writing i have seen in such a long, long time. I almost asked myself, ""Damn disney, what the hell?""I thought maybe with all those useless live action adaptations, at least they have a film that is still in good reputation among audiences, unfortunately that has been put into the fiery pit of despair along with this year's Aladdin and The Lion King.In conclusion, i honestly do not even know what movie it is anymore. I don't recommend seeing it, it is now a ruined premise of what once was adapted from an all-time Disney classic.Side note :Start making original s***, Disney!",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
489,kayadeson,Well..Well...,7,10 November 2019,"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is a 2019 American dark fantasy adventure film produced by Walt Disney , directed by Joachim Ronning. It is a sequel to Maleficent, 2014 film. Main characters played by Angelina Jolie, Elle Fanning, Sam Riley, Imelda Staunton, Juno Temple, and Lesley Manville return to their previous roles, with Harris Dickinson replacing Brenton Thwaites from the first film and Chiwetel Ejiofor, Ed Skrein and Michelle Pfeiffer joining the cast as new characters. This movie is absolutely amazing because of the good acting, beautiful graphics, and understandable story plot. Although this movie has violent scenes which contrast to many others Disney movies for young ages. But this movie is still considered to be one of the great Disney movies of all times.The story tells about when Maleficent travels to Prince Phillip's castle to celebrate Aurora's upcoming wedding. At the party, she meets Aurora's future mother in law Queen Ingris: a conniving queen who wants to destroy the fairies land. Later on, Maleficent joins forces with a seasoned warrior and a group of outcasts to battle the queen and her powerful army.Personally, I like this movie because the plot is good, reasonable, and easy to understand. Also, the graphics are great. The environment and action scenes look very realistic. The story also contains many valuable lessons, such as: the love of mothers, the sacrifice for others, the power of love, and bravery. Besides the acting was great especially from Angelina Jolie(Maleficent) and Elle Fanning(Princess Aurora) in some scenes they don't even have to speak, but the audiences already know how they were feeling at that time. Mostly because they can show their emotions through their eyes. However, there is a contrast or unexpected style for Disney in this movie, because this movie has violent scenes that might still be too much for children or sensitive audiences such as the death scenes, injured scenes that shown blood and wounds during the fight between humans and dark fey.The movie purposely focuses on the mother's love, it is the love that Maleficent has for her step-daughter Princess Aurora. The movie's purpose is absolutely successful because many audiences felt touched and even cried during the love scenes of Maleficent and Princess Aurora. After watching the movie, my friends even talked about one of the scenes between these two that made them cry, because they felt that the love of Maleficent for Aurora that makes her do whatever she must, even something that absolutely is opposite to her personality such as, smiling, and being kind to humans.To conclude, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is an amazing dark fantasy adventure film with great realistic graphic details, story plot, and great acting. Although this movie contains few violent scenes that would be too much for sensitive viewers, this movie still provides valuable lessons such as a mother's love, the sacrify for others, the power of love, and the bravery. Therefore, these are the reasons why I consider this movie to be absolutely worth watching.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

492,Rattanan1996,The movie is exciting and also motivates the audience.,9,10 November 2019,"In this movie, Disney presents Maleficent's character in a different perspective, which audiences cannot predict until the end of the story. The relationships between the two kingdoms are clearly explained at the beginning of the movie, The Moors and The Ulstead, It is an important point that leads the audience to about the conflict that occurred in this story. The presentation is interesting and differs from the old version of the tale.It is clear that the theme of the movie is the power of motherly love. The story presents the relationship between Maleficent and Aurora, godmother and goddaughter. Maleficent loves Aurora very much and can do anything for her. This movie also points to gender equality. The main characters in the story are female. Maleficent who rules the Moors and Queen Ingrith who is the leader in genocide war. Both characters are female, intelligent, have strong leadership skills. On the other hand, the male characters, Prince Philips and King John, did not show the audience great power. They were unable to stop the war caused by trusting their own family.Setting in the movie is supernatural that uses computer graphics to create realism. All characters convey their emotions well. Each character is clear expression that they are on the good or bad side. Audience can understand the characteristic from the tale they have watched or listened to. The plot is uncomplicated but difficult to guess. I prefer Aurora. Although she seems an innocent girl, she is a clever character beyond the imagination of the audience. She is observant and leads to the truthful explanation of the story.Maleficent is worth watching in audiences of all ages and genders. The movie has storytelling in a new way. Audiences often watch Disney movies that the characters sing songs, but there is no singing in this movie. This way is good for them because the movie not boring and protracted.

She has met a man, Stephen who was an ordinary person, when she was a child. However, after a long time, he fought for his personal power and desire. He choose to betray her. Secondly, the special customs of Mayptith was surprised me, because her makeup was so marvel. For example, her head had long horns, and her cheekbones are more prominent than humans.

It has good visuals, as expected from disney and the acting is ok as well, i guess but holy moly, the rest is bad. First of all: why even make a sequal to the first one? (read money)
The last one already did the character of Maleficent no justice but it ended on a statistying note. (for that movie) Than this movie comes in, and trows everything out of the window what the last one achieved. Malificent was no longer a villian, neither did she have a motive to be one at the end of the last movie and there was peace between two worlds. Now, all of the sudden, thats all gone. Just like that. Because movie. From there on its just bad and non sencical. I mean, i liked the winged tribe culture i guess, but for the rest, a definite skip",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

Im giving it 2 stars for Angelina Jolie who never cease to amaze me in her movies. She has always been amazing however i hate the story. I hate how Maleficent was being punish in the movie and how stupid Aurora was. She was the Queen of the Moor however she did almost nothing to save anyone from harm. I even think she is the one who cause all the troubles in the movie. She believed on the Queen which was soo stupid and not believing to the woman who really raised her. The prince is not much of a help either. Maleficent went through a lot of suffering and yet didn't recieved any apology (except from Aurora which i think it is half meant) and at the end the villain didint recieved enough punishment. They didint even imprison her! After all the lives that was lost and the damaged that was been made. The graphics are amazing however I was really disappointed after I watched this movie.

557,movykappa,Good but not awesome,7,18 October 2019,"Having enjoyed the first movie, I had to obviously check this sequel. The main story is not more than a Disney cliché: two young persons in love that somewhat find themselves in a situation that may break them apart forever. The first movie was much more powerful as it did not follow any previously written cliché. Anyway, the movie has good points, excellent acting by Angelina and the rest of the cast in general. Apparent lack of performance by the prince and king, but that's ok. Graphics are amazing, overall. What triggers me most is the end. I understand this is a movie for children, but the end is just baffling. First of all, the ""war"" seems to be too much. The fairies have no plan whatsoever, besides flying around and grabing some guards, whilst they're destroyed by the red power. The Maleficient transforms into a Phoenix but that doesn't help much - actually, it seems to impair her ability to save the princess from the fall of the castle, as she has become clearly heavier and less agile. In the end, after lot's of killings, the castle is essentially destroyed, but everyone gets to be friends in the end, and the wedding proceeds. It just doesn't add up. The Queen, after all the negative stuff she did, is only transformed into a goat. Overall, I believe a more cohesive end would make this movie more enjoyable.

I'd like to see her on more roles that carry emotion. For example she'd do great on ""the keeping hours"" since she really feels the emotions of a mother.

The movie is about peace, clearly.

I'm not sure what they were going for here. Story wise, a toddler could've come up with better plot and dialogue.
There were characters on which the movie focused only because they were cute, but they had 0 influence over the final outcome. This was obviously only to melt children's hearts, so they'd annoy their parents into buying Disney merchandise.
CGI felt forced, cartoonish, and delivered a bad overall cinematic experience, compared to what Disney has been able to provide in the last decade.
The movie included a lot of death in its climatic (and only) battle, only to be treated like nothing happened.
I left the theatre disappointed that I wasted my time and money.
Positives:
Really trying to find something here. I guess I'd watch anything with Angelina in it, since she's been a rare sight on the movie scene recently.
Despite the deaths throughout the movie, It's an ok movie for children under 12. Anyone older might have seen at least one good movie in their lives and could be disappointed. No offense intended if you're younger than 12 and were also disappointed.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

There were actually few twists that I'm almost ashamed I didn't see coming because they should have been predictable (it is still Disney after all). The first movie I thought was okay and I did like it, but this one was so much better! I enjoyed the whole thing, I'm so glad I saw it in theaters.

The movie seems like different sequences that have been put together without really thinking it through. There are also many unanswered questions thoughtout the movie. Anjelina Jolie looks beautiful but her role is dampered by an unimaginative script. Elle is plain and tries hard to shine with little success. If i knew i would have waited for the movie to come out on netflix.,Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

One of the auntie fairies sacrificed herself but aurora ignored that fact and chose to have the wedding less than an hour later.

The tactics used by the winged people made zero sense and got a lot of them killed for no good reason. The chosen one trope gave no explanation as to why she never knew about these, her people. We get a flash of an empty nest insinuating that she was lost or abandoned but that's it. No real explanation. The elaborate plot to kill the fairies by organ-launched poison powder where the fairies did nothing but run around for minutes was torture. Aurora saying, ""this way"" was so dumb because there was only one door. CG and costumes were cool. Action was alright.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

It tries to be Game Of Thrones for children but falls very flat due to its 2 hour run time. Despite the film being called 'Maleficent: Mistress of Evil' there is very little Maleficent in the film and the short period of time she is in it, she definitely isn't evil. Michelle Pfeiffer is a great villian and is the glue that holds this film together.

The second Maleficent delivered more complex characters, more colourful and vibrant images, more flights and actions than the first one that the CGI was already cool. Also the movie gave us more comedic action, even of Maleficent herself XD. I think Disney should make more of winged creature films or maybe Maleficent 3?",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

611,ellakehoe,disappointed,1,19 October 2019,My honest opinion is that this movie had potential but was overall a disappointing journey. What really ruined the experience for me was the lack of a scene between maleficent and the crow. Not what I paid for.,Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
612,yiftach-19679,A must for Stardust's fans,8,20 October 2019,"Let me start by saying that Maleficent 2 is a very nice movie, but it's certainly far from being perfect. Even so, it's definitely better than the first movie and a big surprise for me, as I expected much less to be honest.The movie has a quite standard Disney plot, but is well-crafted and should be enjoyable by any fantasy lover.Now let's get down to business, shall we?
Regarding the movie Stardust, there's no doubt that Maleficent 2 has some of its essence, especially for having Michelle Pfeiffer in its cast.
I hope all of you would agree that the one unforgettable aspect in Stardust was Pfeiffer's performance as Lamia. If so, then you would want to know that in this matter, Maleficent 2 is the ""Stardust 2"" we have never received. The director of Maleficent drew some inspiration from Stardust for Queen Ingrith's role - and if that wasn't enough, he even made little references in the movie to Stardust's Lamia (little hints that are only visible to fans of Stardust).However, please do not expect to witness the rebirth of Lamia in this movie. Queen Ingrith is not the ""queen of witches"" and she will perform no magic during the film. **But** Pfeiffer does get to reprise the villain role and you would be very pleased by her very good performance.Because Stardust won't get its own sequel, I absolutely recommend not to miss this opportunity to see Pfeiffer again in a similar role.In conclusion, in a scale of 1 to Stardust (10), I give Maleficent 2 a score of 8.
In my opinion, no other movie since 2007 has been that close. I truly believe it's a must for any fantasy lover, especially if he's a fan of Stardust.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
613,codysalinas,Love this movie,9,17 November 2019,"The peaceful life of Maleficent as the protector of the Moors and Aurora as the Queen of the Moors changed unexpectedly when Prince Phillip proposed to Aurora and he accepted it. Because Maleficent does not like humans other than Aurora.
Maleficent, which is still played by Angelina Jolie and her adopted daughter Aurora, played by Elle Fanning, began fighting and questioning the meaning of family when the two had different views. It started with the marriage that Aurora wanted opposed by Maleficent.
Unbeknownst to everyone, Phillip's mother, Queen Ingrith, plans to use the marriage to divide humans and fairies forever for the sake of her past revenge. With that Maleficent and Aurora find themselves on the opposite side.
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil presents a conflict that has been alluded to previously, namely the feud between humans and fairies in the Moors. The difference is, in the first film Maleficent remains in principle, namely selfish and greedy creatures. While in this second film, Maleficent is shown as someone who tries to be friendly by holding his ego for Aurora's happiness. Even though in the end, Queen Ingrith still successfully provoked her anger.
Btw I love this movie....",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

The actors and actresses in this movie had me give different emotions for how they portrayed their characters, especially Michelle Pheiffer's character as the queen.

Further, I, along with thousands of other people, have already pre-ordered this film on AppleTV. The cinematography and acting were phenomenal, and the fight for inclusion of outcasts and the misunderstood made this film a success.

622,tummarat,"Good looking picture, but weak story telling.",5,11 November 2019,"The design, and actors' performances are the strengths which make this film elegant, but the story is the major weakness. CGI with good design make the world of Mistress Of Evil look stunning. It is beautifully realized, with lush landscapes and interesting creatures. Likewise, amazing acting from the gorgeous Angelina Jolie, as she proves no one else could have played the role of Maleficent but herself. Elle Fanning or Queen Aurora, and Jolie have magnetic chemistry that brings the story together as a whole. Furthermore, the interaction between Maleficent and villain Queen Ingrith is also incredible. However, the film's plot is considered as a weak story. It is easily predicted, which makes most parts of the film lack excitement. For example, Aurora's fascination towards Prince Phillip is cause of the main conflict, the film would be nothing without it. While it is not a very strong story, it is still as enjoyable as its first film was. If you are a fancier of Disney's fairy tales, you will not be disappointed. If you are looking for a good film to watch, it could not even be an option.Tummarat Sunta

623,pdjustballett,predictable but enjoyable.,7,13 November 2019,"As a fan of Disney, I was excited to see it in theater. After watching it, I was stunned by the beautiful scenery and costumes, even more than I was at its' first film. The story is predictable as it is considered a movie for kids. I feel like it portrays almost all of humans' emotions and social issues within two hours. One minute I smiled widely at the cuteness of Moors' creatures, and a minute after I cried a gallon of tears in the church scene. Moreover, the film shows that racial discrimination happens everywhere even in a fantasy world. Among the group, there is always some who think that they are better than others, that they deserve more privileges, and try to make the society worse by using violence. Accordingly, I am glad that the movie try to teach children that those actions bring no peace and only create hatred among people. Also, I love that the queen's costumes are white contrasting to Maleficent. It will be easier for children to learn that good or bad does not depend on appearances. One think I'm worried is that the killing scene in the church is quite gloomy and cruel. It might be only me and minor group of people who feel that this scene is similar to the Holocaust, except it makes the situation less severe, but it could still be a nightmarish experience for some children. So, It would be proper for children under 10 - 12 to be under parents' guidance as it noted in the certification. I hope that parents would not overlook this issue.Sirisakul Phandaeng,

625,arpasiriram,Great scene and main character with uncomplicated plot,8,14 November 2019,"In my view, the plot is not very complicated. It is not too hard to guess who a mysterious character that creates the conflicts is. However, this is a sequel to the Maleficent 2014. For this reason, it might be better if you watch the previous version in order to understand the movie's story-line clearly.The two elements of this movie that really impressed me are the special effects and the main character. This movie provides the spectacular scenes with the great special effects; all the pictures in the movies are fascinating. I was attracted by every scene. For this reason, this movie is considered one of the great fantasy movies. This film also provides the characteristic of Maleficent in a different way that is beyond expectation. According to the movie's title, Maleficent is a mistress of evil. Unexpectedly, in this film, Maleficent is a woman who can amuse the audiences by her innocent look.If you are the person who impresses with the beautiful scenes with the spectacular special effects, this movie is one of the interesting choices.Arpasiri Ramkham Mahasarakham University, Thailand",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
626,praewichiro,Quite impressive!,8,12 November 2019,"There are many interesting scenes. The film begins with Aurora in beautiful garden, where there are several fairies flying it is beautiful to watch. Everything looks very beautiful and realistic. At the end, the wedding looks beautiful with all the flowers and other things. There is no gore, and very little blood, though there are some heartbreaking deaths throughout. The strong performance from three women where they are not fighting over a man, but fighting over family and country. Angelina Joli, Elle Fanning, and Michelle Pfeiffer make this film worth screening again and again. My view is they have a great understanding of the character, therefore, the acting and emotion portrayed is perfect. All of the costumes are gorgeous particularly Maleficent's majestic wings and Queen Ingrith's gown. The movie has several dark parts, loud noises, a battle scene, and lots of suspense. In addition, the movie uses its fantastical race of creatures to contrast the beauty of nature against the cold brutality of humanity. The dark fays evolve to live in different climates, and they range from sand-colored desert dwellers to jungle fae with rainbow-hued macaw-esque wings.Maleficent: Mistress of Evil keep the audience spellbound all through as they journey by this magical fantasy. Like most Disney movies, it has a heartwarming and blissful ending that can undoubtedly put a smile in your face.Kanittha Saenyamool

The magnificent fantasy scene and impressive dialogue really held the audience's attention and also a bit comedy between the scene kept them on the edge of their seats. However, For a number of scenes, it needed hard to tell the flashback or more background that had passed since the last time a given character had been on screen e.g. Queen Ingrith abruptly appeared a barbaric villain as its needs to draw their setting much more in order to keep the audiences get into her reason for starting a war.Despite the film's minor shortcomings, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is exciting, creative, and fancy - and well worth an hour of your time to watch.Sirichai Saengjan Mahasarakham University, Thailand",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

630,bambampopo,Well...well...,7,11 November 2019,"The movie purposely focuses on the mother's love, it is the love that Maleficent has for her step-daughter Princess Aurora. The movie's purpose is absolutely successful because many audiences felt touched and even cried during the love scenes of Maleficent and Princess Aurora. After watching the movie, my friends even talked about one of the scenes between these two that made them cry, because they felt that the love of Maleficent for Aurora that makes her do whatever she must, even something that absolutely is opposite to her personality such as, smiling, and being kind to humans. This movie is an amazing dark fantasy adventure film with great realistic graphic details, story plot, and great acting. Although this movie contains few violent scenes that would be too much for sensitive viewers, this movie still provides valuable lessons such as a mother's love, the sacrify for others, the power of love, and the bravery. Therefore, these are the reasons why I consider this movie to be absolutely worth watching.Patipat Suwannabut

631,kaemhom,One of the best sequels,8,11 November 2019,"The strength of this movie is the plot. It is very classic fairy tale and directly impacts my heart. The mother-and-daughter relationship is what I can see in the movie. It is beautiful yet fragile. Although Aurora disbelieves Maleficent at first, she knows Maleficent better than others. Deep in her heart, she still believes that her beloved mother is not a bad person. The plot becomes more tense in the middle of the movie which is when Aurora knows the truth. And the movie ends happily like other fairy tales. Another strength of Maleficent : Mistress of Evil is graphics. This includes CGI (Computer Graphic Imaging) and costumes. About 70% in the movie is made by CGI. Thus, it makes the movie interesting and beautiful to watch.Though the movie is very outstanding, there is one thing that makes it less interesting. The voice actor who plays Maleficent role is not suitable for Maleficent's original voice. Since I have watched both Thai and English versions, Maleficent's voice has to be powerful. However, Thai version is not. The voice acting has an impact on the movie, it could show how that character is feeling at that moment. That is why it is very significant to find someone suitable to do a voice-over of Maleficent role.Maleficent : Mistress of Evil is one of the best movies in 2019. There are many impacts throughout the movie. It is also suitable for all ages. With an easy plot, everyone can get a message that the movie wants to tell which is love, truth and belief. Though the voice acting of Maleficent is not that impressive, it is counted as a tiny mistake which I can ignore. If you would like to enjoy a dark fantasy story which contains good lessons about life, Maleficent : Mistress of Evil is what I recommend to watch.Pakjeera Pothipoen

633,rattananson,Interesting story !!!,8,11 November 2019,"Disney presents Maleficent's character in a different perspective, which audiences cannot predict until the end of the story. The relationships between the two kingdoms are clearly explained at the beginning of the movie, The Moors and The Ulstead, It is an important point that leads the audience to about the conflict that occurred in this story. The presentation is interesting and differs from the old version of the tale.It is clear that the theme of the movie is the power of motherly love. The story presents the relationship between Maleficent and Aurora, godmother and goddaughter. Maleficent loves Aurora very much and can do anything for her. This movie also points to gender equality. The main characters in the story are female. Maleficent who rules the Moors and Queen Ingrith who is the leader in genocide war. Both characters are female, intelligent, have strong leadership skills. On the other hand, the male characters, Prince Philips and King John, did not show the audience great power. They were unable to stop the war caused by trusting their own family.Overall, Maleficent is worth watching in audiences of all ages and genders. The movie has storytelling in a new way. Audiences often watch Disney movies that the characters sing songs, but there is no singing in this movie. This way is good for them because the movie not boring and protracted.Rattanan Songyen, Mahasarakham University, Thailand",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
634,ScotchStone,Impressive!!,8,20 November 2019,"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is the sequel movie. It is one of the best and most successful fantasy movies created by the Walt Disney Company. The movie drives audience to the surreal world which is full of magic, fairies, and imaginative creatures. The movie is considered excellent in terms of amusement and life lesson. Therefore, in this review, it will point out the summary, the critique towards the strengths and weaknesses, and my suggestion.
Even though Maleficent repents of wrong doing since the prequel, she again becomes a villain due to the rumor from the neighboring kingdom of Ulstead, the kingdom ruled by King John and Queen Ingrith. In this sequel, Aurora has reigned as Queen of the Moors and Maleficent serves as its protector. The conflict begins when Aurora intends to marry with Prince Phillip but Maleficent disagrees with that. So, Maleficent argues with Aurora and afterward Maleficent is shot by the solider of Queen Ingrith. In the end of the movie, Maleficent allows her daughter to marry with Prince Phillip. Moreover, she again brings about a reconciliation and peace to the people of Moors and Ulstead.
The movie has many strong points: the great computer graphics and sound, the appropriate casting, and the useful hidden message. Firstly, the sound and computer graphics was exquisitely created which extremely makes audience amazed. Secondly, the actors and actresses in the movie are actually professional and skillful. They greatly drive and fascinate audience to believe and understand the nature of each character. Lastly, the movie specifies the strong relationship between Aurora and maleficent. Even though they are not the real mother and child, they truly love each other. Besides, the movie also indicates the importance of peacefulness by pointing out the badness and consequences of war.
Even though the movie has many strong points, there are also some weaknesses: the inferior in Thai dubbing of film, and the contradiction of the plot. In the opening scene of Maleficent, the scene that she stands on the cliff, the voice actress did very badly. The emotion of Maleficent in the scene should be elegant and powerful but the dubbing voice is totally different. The voice is so high and the emotion is actually playful. Therefore, it greatly affects to the feeling of audience. As for the second weakness, it is the contradiction of the plot. According to the curse in the prequel, Maleficent only cursed Aurora to prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel, and fall into a sleep like death. However, it is very paradoxical when King John was hurt and cursed by the same spindle.
For my suggestion, the end of Queen Ingrith should be worse. As she hurts and kills many people, so she deserves something worse than being just a goat. Even though it is the film made for children and other people, it should present the deserved consequence of doing bad thing in order to teach children to be afraid of doing something bad.
In conclusion, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil has both strengths and weaknesses. The strengths are the great computer graphics and sound, the appropriate casting, the valuable hidden message. As for the weaknesses, there are the inferior in Thai dubbing of film, and the contradiction of the plot. However, due to its distinguished advantages, the movie is considered one of the best movies in this year. Thus, I would like to suggest this movie to everyone since it is definitely worthwhile to watch.PHIJIT BOONCHALEAW (59010112021) Mahasarakham University, Thailand",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

Even though they are not the real mother and child, they truly love each other. Besides, the movie also indicates the importance of peacefulness by pointing out the badness and consequences of war.

636,supaponpan,Quite predictable but prominent!,6,12 November 2019,"Overall, Maleficent is regarded as a great fantasy movies; it is worth watching although the plot is quite predictable. There are many outstanding elements in the movie but there are two things which draw my attention. Firstly, the protagonist is well presented as she is dressed with specific theme of clothes along with her Lucifer figure, a representation of evil and revenge. Additionally, the change of accent is significant. Though originally, the actress is an American, she changes her accent into British accent to impersonate the intelligent beautiful and grievous protagonist Maleficent. This makes the movie more interesting and worth watching.Supapon Panthamon

637,MonthakanM,Good Conflicting Presentations,7,12 November 2019,"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, it was produced by Walt Disney Pictures. In this film, Maleficent is still the main character of the story, but in the victim's role. Although this movie is regarded as an adventure fantasy movie, what the writer tries to present seems realistic in terms of presenting social problems. The film presents the power of greed, the hunger for power, and the love of a mother. The film also points out that demons do not need to be in demons' figures. It is because they might hide inside human facades.The prominent points include interesting conflict presentations and giving an idea about motherly love. To create conflicts, the writer raises the issue of greed within humans to create conflicts between characters. This movie has many conflicting issues. The internal conflict in Princess Aurora is quite interesting. For example, she hesitates about whom to believe when Phillip's father suddenly gets sick on her wedding day. The anxiety arises from Queen Ingrith's attempt to convince Aurora to believe that her stepmother cursed him. Though Aurora has known her stepmother for years, she falls into Queen Ingrith's trap. As a result, the relationship between these two is shaky. The scene that shows how great Maleficent's love for Aurora is, is when she quickly flew to protect her falling from a castle. The castle is high off the ground, but while injured, she still does it.In spite of many prominent points, it also has a weak point. The summary of the end is too quick. It might lead the audience to think this movie has an irrational ending. I mean Aurora and Phillip get married too soon. They get married on the same day after the war between Maleficent and Queen Ingrith ends, which is too fast. I think the movie would sound well-reasoned if peace and townspeople's ways of life in both Ulstead and Moors were shown more. Although the end comes too soon, the other parts of the movie are produced totally absorbing and enthralling until the end. I recommend this movie. It is enjoyable and worth watching.Monthakan Mumdaeng.

638,kanokwansril,"Boring plot, but fantastic special effects",5,13 November 2019,"I think the plot of this film is quite boring due to a simple plot. I would like to say that I can guess what comes next. In my perspective, the reason why this film is popular is the casting, especially Angelina Jolie who plays Maleficent. She seems outstanding due to her work experiences in movie industry and the plot. I ensure to say that she was born to be Maleficent. However, the special effects make this film more interesting. Every scene has the beautiful pictures. It seems to me that this is a reason why it is called a fantasy movie.Kanokwan Srilapat Mahasarakham University, Thailand.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

The plot is more intense than the 2014 version. There are many get into tear scenes. This is a flawless fun-to-watch film for me.Kiattipoom Pasiram, Mahasarakham University, Thailand",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
640,wutthikraihan,You can bring a bit of kindness to the world,8,18 November 2019,"THIS is one of my favorite movies of the year. A part from the beauty we see in the film, there are many underlying morals hidden in it. One of them is about 'Love' I can honestly say that if you have never been in love before, this movie can change your perspective towards love. It shows that love conquers everything. The movie shows that despite their differences, they still chose to marry each other and it is their love to each other that unite two kingdoms together.
I would like to recommend this movie to all fantasy fans. The film is full of great scenery which will inspire you to imagine your fantasy wonderland and most people would not certainly be disappointed after watching it. I would like to end this by quoting Aurora, she said ""You can bring a bit of kindness to the world"". She knew what the world needed a bit more kindness. It needed less anger. It needed better people. It cost zero to be kind. We could do well to have a kinder heart. We could become better if we only chose to treat people right.Wutthikrai Hanchithr Mahasarakham University, Thailand",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
641,parama_n,Incredible Movie,8,15 November 2019,"I had an opportunity to watch a movie called Maleficent: Mistress of Evil. The plot is continuing from Maleficent in 2014 version. There is some interesting points on this film. It is representing in another of Maleficent.Personally, the plot on this film is really good one because there are many interesting scenes. For example, In the dining room that is similar to the teaser, I feel like this setting on the scene has a powerful. So, I really love the scene. Costuming is really exceptional; especially Maleficent, I noticed that she wears approximately eight costumes in this film. In the film, I noticed that the costume in each of scene has difference style. It makes me impressed in this character. Additionally, I especially liked how Maleficent portray his emotion in every single scene. Angelina is able to catch the audience completely.Over all, Maleficent: Mistress of evil is recommended for watching. Costuming in this film is really distinguished, it shows that the evolution of this character. Everyone can watch this film for entertainment. There is an actual thrill to it in every single scene.Paraman Petchritthiron Mahasarakham University, Thailand",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
642,siriphornyia,Wonderful but a bit boring,7,15 November 2019,"Evil differs from human at all. The evil reminds someone of something disgusting and heartless. No matter how the evil really looks, it has a heart which is completely full of kindness and love as Maleficent does. By contrast, some humans'appearances look so kind but they actually hide something crueler and much rotten. Obviously, the movie presents about ideas of desire, greed, mind set and motherly love shown in the characters. Finally, these ideas lead to good and bad end.To begin with, Maleficent is a type of fantastic movie created by Walt Disney. Firstly, it is narrated that Princess Aurora's wedding ceremony is held while bad situations are happening in the Magical Wood. As Maleficent is handling these situations and she is discovering something more surprising that she is originally Dark Fay. Unfortunately, everything turns worse when Queen Ingrith attempts to kill Aurora and destroy the empire to make a war. Fortunately, she is rescued by Maleficent and eventually they end the way between humans and Dark Fay. Obviously, Maleficent loves Aurora so much so she will be willing to protect and change herself for her beloved daughter.Personally, I love this movie since it is exciting when her background is revealed and it is appropriate for each generation. Plus, the tight bond between her and Aurora thrills and touches my heart. She changes her bad mind set to humans for her daughter. I have learnt that love, especially motherly love can save and end everything well. Due to purest love, hatred and greed end and consequently it brings about happiness. However, I think the movie is a bit boring because no extreme action scenes are produced. As I was mentioned, it makes the movie less intense and less exciting.Siriphorn Yiamsombat.

644,katnoelle-32217,Disney is afraid to make a villain movie!,4,18 November 2019,"Maleficent is supposed to be one of the most feared and evil villains of all time and Disney has ruined that. For those of you out there who appreciated Maleficent as being a mistress of evil do not let this title fool you. Maleficent is not evil at all, but on the contrary she only becomes more soft. I am all for character development and good characters, but I also appreciate good villains and it is frustrating to watch as Disney takes a beloved villain and turns her good. I want to watch a Maleficent movie where Disney is not afraid to let her live up to her name, which means ""Mistress of evil."" The movie's plot was also incredibly predictable. Disney is relying too much on there name and CGI effects that they aren't producing actual quality in there storytelling. The acting of prince Phillip was terrible as well. I understand that he is not supposed to be the main focal point of the movie, but that's just another area where Disney was lazy. To make a good movie every aspect counts and every character in the film should be well written out. Overall not a good movie and definitely would not see again.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

This movie is interesting but it would be boring for people who do not like simple plot. However, the stunning elements and organization can attract audiences' attention. These make the movie full of colorful scenes. The movie is suitable for all ages especially people who love watching fantasy movies. The quality of CGI totally creates virtual reality such as the inhuman beings and the Moors. This increases the ability of imagination of audiences.I would like to recommend this movie to people who love fantasy and simple plot.

647,thanawatrat,"The best elements of film, but unreasonable plot",6,22 November 2019,"In the film, the most exact strong point is a casting of every character. All of the main and extra characters perform their role as though they are real living beings. Especially, the acting of Angelina Jolie as the Evil Mistress persuades audiences to believe in her role as a strong prestigious character to prevail over other characters. Furthermore, costumes and most CGI are able to attract audience' attention to be persuaded through the story. These elements are undisputed in terms of reliability.
However, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil still retains weak points. First of all, the plot of the movie is vague and unreasonable following the previous film. For example, the action of Aurora to Maleficent is unreasonable in the palace of Prince Phillip scene. Aurora betrays her godmother and disbelieves the individual who truly love her. She changes side to support Queen Ingrith who she just meets for first time. This point is obviously unreasonable. Furthermore, the three fairies are known as a magician. They contain magical power according to the prior film. In the church where citizens of the Moors are imprisoned, the plot manipulates the fairies to forget to use magic to help those monsters. Indeed, they are able to activate spells to destroy the door, or the piano. Moreover, Queen Ingrith commits numerous sins intending to slay people of the moors and Dark Faes and poison her husband. The story is seemingly terminated in good ending that the queen is cursed to be a goat, but the message sent may prove opposite; children watching this movie may not be correctly educated morally. Teaching them to be aware of retribution is more appropriate.Thanawat Rattanasiri ,Mahasarakham Uiversity, Thailand",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
648,dotike,And the 'Worst Queen'-Award goes to...,4,4 January 2020,"... Aurora.And that really is an achievment, if you consider that her only contestant was a cruel and despicable person, who was willing to curse her own husband and king so that she could go ahead with her plans for genocide.Throughout the whole movie Aurora completely lacks any agenda, political acumen or situational awareness, which is a great problem for a lead character who was supposed to be the beloved queen of the Moors. Not only did she fail to live up to that, her performance as a politican would have actively hurt her own standing and by extension the people she is supposed to represent and protect.Some examples of that:
she curtsies to Queen Ingrith, completely missing the slight that her show of respect was not returneddid not intervene when Ingrith repeatedly gravely insults her or her godmother during a state dinner by telling Maleficent during a state dinner to just use her hands after they gave her for her poisenous cutlery, by dismissing Maleficent as a suitable mother and letting her be attacked by a catshe does not even speak up when Ingrith decides for her that Aurora will of course live in Ulstead which would obviously take her away from her people and her own kingdomshe blatantly admits to Ingrith, who - just a reminder - is the queen of a neighboring country that she ""has no idea what she's doing""I could go on, but I believe I made clear why I believe that Aurora is such a terrible lead character. It was the first great annoyance in this movie for me.Now some people might say that all that is no big deal because Maleficent is supposed to be a childrens movie, but I couldn't disagree more. Just because it's for children does not mean you can just make your characters into idiots, in fact it's all the more reason not to. They certainly made Ingrith into an intelligent person, no reason not to do the same to Aurora.Then again, it's not like they seem to expect their viewers to be especially clever, if the script is any indication. There are so many inconsistencies and plotholes in it, I felt positively insulted. Which is the second great annoyance.They introduced their 'secret anti-fae weapon' to be deadly but difficult and 'painstaking' to create. Apparently not so painstaking because the very next day they suddenly had enough to equip a whole army with it.An army which was conveniently positioned to defend the city against an outward attack they couldn't ever have known about, while the fae they were supposed to be employed against was inside the city. Yeah, makes no sense at all, but apparently they needed a flimsy excuse to film a big battle with lots of cgi and special effects.Which was pretty and well done, make no mistake. It just didn't make any sense.The greatest potential - plotwise - had the Dark Fae, but sadly they amounted to nothing more than a way to provide bodies and an excuse for the aforemention battle.All in all, the technical aspects of the movie were consistenly well done, the acting was largely very good (special mention to Michelle Pfeiffer who did a great job portaying Ingrith), but sadly much of that was voided by the atrocious script.If you want to watch Maleficent, do yourselves a favor and rewatch the first one. It has it's own share of problems, but remains the far better alternative.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

You can't tell whether it's a pure Disney movie or a nee revolutionary one (like what they did with Frozen and Maleficent 1). Another one is there's not enough room for any characters to develop their own path in the storyline. Especially Aurora's part was complete off.Visual and sound is good as usual. Disney quality.

This was my favorite AJ movie I've ever seen. I don't remember her having many lines, but you feel her emotions throughout (especially maternal ones).

Maleficent Mistress of Evil is a truly entertaining film with action as big as many of Marvel's films and visuals nearly as stunning as James Cameron's Avatar.The visuals were beautiful and impressive from scene one; akin to the many imaginary worlds created by Pixar. The barrel roll that they flew the audience into during the opening sequence gives one the sensation of flight (similar to Disney's Soaring rides) and leaves one with a slight sensation of vertigo.Maleficent Mistress of Evil has a story that was written to seen and enjoyed on today's biggest screens.

686,cristi031,Very good overall,7,16 January 2020,I really liked it and I think the plot was good with the possibility for a 3rd part. Angelina Jolie played very well same as Sam Riley. I find Elle's Fanning character a bit silly and the young's princess character too weak.,Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

This series deserve more movies but I guess this was the end? I hope not.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
691,sissyhippo45,Outstanding,8,18 October 2019,"It is said that sequels never surpass the original, well I can definitely say that this movie blows the first one right off the planet. Whether you see it in 3D or not the cinematography right along with the CGI is brilliant. The storyline is crisp and the technicolor will floor you. On the downside I wish that the writers would have held back some of the suspense. They told everything in the beginning that's like going to a murder mystery play and the actors tell you who did it. Hold back some things writers let the audience think for themselves. And when the credits start moving so should you there's nothing at the end.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

It was fun and sweet and exciting and had everything needed to make this a great ride for kids and their parents. I mean most parents don't go to Disney World and leave their children at home...right? The performances were right on. Directing. Cinematography, set design. All perfect. This is a Disney Movie for families. Fun. Entertaining. And yes. A perfect day for my little girl and I. Thanks Elle, Angelina, and Michelle!",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
699,nikkon-niko,Decent acting meets a horrible storyline,2,23 October 2021,Thr acting and CGI was good...everything else a hot pile of sh**.Dont waste your time with this poor written story.Character decisions are all not relateable at all and the whole plot is a plothole.After a slow first half this movie reaches a point where no logic is shown what so ever. Things happrn just like that without any background or explanation.The bad story feels like a parody what made me laugh some times. So here we go...2 stars and never again.,Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

XDBut anyway, it is a Disney story and a fairy tale, what do we expect? although it is abit of let down for the ending finale, but overall it is still an enjoyable movie that suitable for children and most adult.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

708,francescagabriela,Everybody became a film critic overnight!,10,11 May 2020,"The movie may not deserve a 10, but I felt like it was the most beautiful thing I've seen the year it came out. I went to the cinema to see it and honestly cried a little, like 2-3 times. It had so much emotion, so much magic and nature. It just underlined the truth about our world. People always try to destroy what they don't understand and nature and animals are always too naive and trust people. Just stop criticizing it so much and relax while watching. It was honestly a thousand times better than the final season of GOT. So let's stop being hypocrites, cause I doubt any of you could have made a better script.Oh and by the way, most of you aren't official film critics, so nobody really cares how unsatisfied you were while watching. There are way worse movies, which I bet, all those people who have Maleficent a bad review, rated better.Beauty is in the eye of the beholder!",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

711,noelkongnik,Mehhh,4,18 October 2019,"Typical type c movie that has predictable story and only rely on the ""special effect"". What really disappoint me is the fact that this movie with it super high budget cannot give this impact to its viewer. This movie make me regret every penny i spend to watch it.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
712,alexmelbro,One of the worst movies I have ever seen...,1,20 January 2020,"I had to stop the movie several times so I didn't explode. It was the most annoying movie I have ever seen. It's a shame because the first one was good and the CGI is still remarkable, but the plot and the characters are so dumb.The movie starts of by telling us that the humans are still seeing Maleficent as evil. That's fine... even though it has just been a couple of years, but I guess some people doesn't change. But you wish that Aurora would still show some love or at least some character after the first one! I mean, she just let people mock and harass her god mother. I wouldn't take that if I was her. Maleficent saved Aurora and made her princess of the Moors! Yet she still sits there and doesn't protect her ""mother"". How weak! But Aurora isn't the only one that is incredible weak... Prince Philip is so meaningless and the role as a princes doesn't seem to apply. If the king dies, then the crown goes over to the princes. We have all seen Game of Thrones. In order to let the Queen get the authority the ""male"" children has to be dead. Yet this Queen act like she rules the kingdom. Where is the soldiers loyalty towards the crown?Aurora seems to forgot her kingdom. And the Moors seems to forgot that they have fought in battles before. One person is sitting and playing a ""piano of death"", and the fairies are just sitting there, accepting their death... what a shame. The only one (again) that's being logical is Maleficent herself.Oh...there are also Dark fairies in the movie, almost forgot... that's how pointless they are. They are just flying around on the battlefield... seriously, what are they doing? So no feelings attached for the dark fairies because they came so late into the movie. Like the director himself forgot about them.So do not waste your time watching this...",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

717,romerrulida,Don't believe the good reviews!,2,3 January 2020,"It's my first time reviewing here on IMDB because I had to. Oh my, this movie was just horrible and the plot was a total wreck.Queen Aurora was utterly useless throughout the whole movie. Imagine choosing to trust a stranger instead of your godmother whom you knew for years. She's so obsessed with the prince that all she could think about was the marriage. She got Maleficent killed just because she's so stupid. Annoying!Not enough Maleficent -- even though she was supposedly the main protagonist and people actually pay money to see her. Meh.The resolve of the characters were so shallow. Killing one another then after 30 minutes, they all became friends? Lol.Killed half the fairies and dark feys but no mourning whatsoever? Just continue the wedding and celebrate?Waste of time watching this. The first movie is really superior!",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
718,chrdomdip,Predictably great,8,20 October 2019,These critics giving poor reviews are imbeciles. Everything was on point.,Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
719,anzhelikayugay,All that for Aurora?!,1,1 January 2020,So many creatures died because of Aurora's ignorance and Maleficent's ignorant obsession with her. And then they celebrated. The title is misleading. Mistress of Evil? Maleficent is I do not know what but not evil.,Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
720,alvarodsolari,Not the Typical Disney Love Story ... Regardless It Is Very Enjoyable,8,22 October 2019,"I really don't understand the critics with this movie. I've heard from several websites claiming that this movie was worst than Maleficent (2014) because it got involved into politics and not they typical love story that we are used to in Disney movies. Such an example could be how the marriage between Aurora and Phillip was pushed not only for love but because they wanted to unite both kingdoms. However, from my perspective this is what made this movie better than the first one. Realistically, this is how marriage was treated in the past and how it might even still be today among some tribes. Although this is a fantasy movie, that detail made the humans seem more like our society has been throughout history in my opinion. It was a very enjoyable film to watch and if you get the chance you should definitely do so.",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil

726,mrajolie,Brilliant Sequel,10,23 October 2019,"I would recommend this movie to ANYONE!! The plot was quite solid, the performances given by everyone was extraordinary and it was visually stunning!! Angelina Jolie was captivating every time she was onscreen! She's phenomenal. I could not fault it even if I wanted to! There are some interesting story arcs that will appeal to everyone! Ultimately, It doesn't feel like an ""unnecessary sequel"" because the story actually works! There are beautiful messages in the film and so many emotions. I've personally watched it twice!
Don't allow a group of critics influence your decision on whether you should see this film! Because at the end of the day they're simply individuals who happened to not like the movie! Should those people dictate what movie you should or shouldn't watch? I think not",Maleficent - Mistress of Evil
