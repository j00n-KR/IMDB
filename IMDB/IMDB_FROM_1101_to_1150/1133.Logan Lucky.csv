0,Leofwine_draca,Really not very funny,4,7 May 2018,"I could swear that a few years ago Steven Soderbergh retired from the movies but here he is making them again. LOGAN LUCKY is a light-hearted crime comedy in much the same vein as OCEAN'S ELEVEN, although lacking that film's likeable, ensemble cast. Here we have a couple of lunk-headed brothers in the form of a limited Channing Tatum and an overrated Adam Driver who decide to carry out a heist during a Nascar race. Aiding them is an almost unrecognisable Daniel Craig as a quirky convict who has to be broken out of prison to help with the safecracking. Craig seems to be having more fun than he does in his Bond performances. The film is light on sense and heavy on humour, but I'm afraid I didn't find it very funny at all; Seth MacFarlane, for instance, is entirely unbelievable and annoying as the British racing driver.",Logan Lucky
1,SnoopyStyle,the southern Ocean,6,1 March 2018,"Jimmy Logan (Channing Tatum) is a former football star with a bum leg. He loses his construction job at the Charlotte Motor Speedway. His wealthy ex-wife threatens to move out of state taking their daughter with her. With his sister Mellie (Riley Keough) and one-handed Iraq-vet brother Clyde (Adam Driver), he devises a plan to rob the Speedway during a hectic race. They recruit explosive expert Joe Bang (Daniel Craig) despite him being locked up in prison. There are also Joe's idiot hillbilly tech brothers Sam and Fish.This is a fun little caper. Director Steven Soderbergh delivers every bit of white trash joy. The problem for me is that I don't believe in these characters. I don't know if anybody is from the south but certainly, 007 is no southerner. It's a wacky time in the vain of his Ocean movies. I kept seeing a platinum blonde James Bond which pulled me out of the movie. I wonder if Soderbergh didn't have to force his southern origins. I like the caper until the twist on the caper. Those surprise twist often comes in these movies but this one has a lot of conveniences. Overall, there are loads of light fun if one is willing.",Logan Lucky
2,Horst_In_Translation,A fun watch for the most part,6,9 October 2017,"""Logan Lucky"" is a new American film from 2017 and the most recent work by director Steven Soderbergh and with works like this we can be glad he did not actually retire as he intended a while ago. The screenplay is by Rebecca Blunt and it is actually her very first writing credit, so a really huge project to start off your career. It runs for almost 120 minutes and tells the story of two brothers planning and executing a heist while people pay attention to a nearby car race. There are many well-known actors in here. Tatum and Driver play the central characters while the supporting cast is also star-studded: Holmes, MacFarlane, 2-time Oscar winner Swank and Daniel Craig with platinum blonde hair. The latter was of course great fun for me as I am a big Bond fan and you really don't get to see Craig a lot outside the franchise. And ""fun"" is also what this film is really all about. It does not offer any truly great performances or deep and sophisticated character writing, but it is a truly entertaining adventure from start to finish. You will need a little while to understand and remember who is who as there are really many characters part of the story here, but once you made this connection, it becomes a really rewarding watch.Well perhaps there is a weakness here and there and the whole concept is not too realistic and probably nothing that could have actually happened like that in real life, but that does not take away one bit from the fun factor. It's most likely a film that will not find any slots during the most crucial awards ceremonies, but it is highly enjoyable and sometimes that's worth even more. A colorful, fast and often witty work that succeeds thanks to the likability of the characters in it. Almost everything was done right here and I think with the Coens in charge, this could have been one of the year's best as the story and approach would really fit their style. The way it actually turned out it was ""only"" a good movie, but definitely a highly promising rookie effort by Blunt that certainly makes me curious about her future projects. 2 hours certainly worth seeing. Go for it.",Logan Lucky
3,Prismark10,Racing to the vault,6,4 December 2017,"Logan Lucky by Steven Soderbergh is the flip side to his Ocean 11 trilogy that tended to get smugger with each new sequel.We follow the Logans, Jimmy (Channing Tatum) his one armed bartender brother Clyde (Adam Driver) and their sister Mellie (Riley Keough.) The family is notorious for being dogged by bad luck.Jimmy loses his job at a mine underneath a race track. He plans to rob the huge money vault located underground which collects all the takings during a NASCAR race.Jimmy needs the help of explosive expert Joe Bang (Daniel Craig) who is locked up and needs breaking out of jail and then put back in.Everyone with their southern drawls rather hoodwinks the audience that the Logans are not up to the heist or properly thought it through. The film is fun, actually rather clever but also a bit slow and laboured. I guess it is hard to take some of the characters too seriously but it is an enjoyable popcorn film.",Logan Lucky
4,kosmasp,Do you feel lucky ... Logan? Well do you?,8,27 October 2017,"I'm not trying to compare this with Dirty Harry in any way, I'm just playing with the words the title is giving us. And of course that applies to the movie in a sense too. I understand if people might go predictable and convenient on a couple of things. But the movie still has a lot of twists and turns along the way, to make it interesting.We have Channing Tatum who does carry this movie quite well, though he is helped a lot by the supporting cast around him. If you like caper movies and the thrill of them, this is one movie you will be interested in. If it depends on how this ends, you have to look at other reviews who may spoil this. I won't do that and let you find out ... I think they chose the right way to go ...",Logan Lucky
5,jboothmillard,Logan Lucky,5,13 December 2020,"I saw the trailer for this movie in the cinema, I didn't even realise that director Steven Soderbergh Sex, Lies, and Videotape, Erin Brockovich, Traffic, Ocean's Eleven) came out of retirement, intending Behind the Candelabra to be his final film, I hoped I would like it. Basically, in West Virginia, Jimmy Logan (Channing Tatum) is laid off from his construction job in the tunnels underneath the Charlotte Motor Speedway. He has a daughter, Sadie (Farrah Mackenzie), who he is really close to, she lives with her mother, Bobbie Jo (Katie Holmes), and new rich husband, Moody (David Denman). One night, Jimmy visits is brother, Clyde (Adam Driver), who lost his lower arm fighting in Iraq, at the bar he works as a bartender. At the bar, pretentious NASCAR-team owner Max Chilblain (Seth MacFarlane) makes fun of Clyde's disability; Jimmy gets into a fight with him, while Clyde sets fire to his car. The next day, Jimmy tells Clyde that he plans to rob the Speedway, exploiting his knowledge of its underground pneumatic tube system for moving its vast amount of money. Clyde and Jimmy recruit their sister Mellie (Riley Keough), incarcerated safe-cracker and explosives expert Joe Bang (Daniel Craig), and Joe's dim-witted brothers, Sam (Brian Gleeson, Brendan's son) and Fish (Jack Quaid, son of Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan). They plan to break Joe out of prison and return him later the same day. Clyde intentionally gets himself sent to prison on a minor charge. With the help of a woman working at the vault, Mellie, Sam, and Fish infest the Speedway's tube system with painted cockroaches, determining which tubes go to the vault. While gathering supplies, Jimmy meets former schoolmate Sylvia Harrison (Katherine Waterston), she runs a mobile clinic which needs donations. Jimmy learns that construction at the speedway is being completed ahead of schedule, during the big and busier race on Memorial Day weekend, they are forced to mount the heist a week earlier. Joe arranges for fellow inmates to stage a riot, resulting in a lockdown, hiding his and Clyde's escape. Mellie meets them in a Ford Shelby GT350 stolen from Moody. At the speedway, Sam and Fish blow up a generator to disable the credit card machines, forcing vendors to take cash only. Clyde, Jimmy, and Joe enter the tube room, and Joe uses an improvised explosive device to blow open the gate from the tube to the vault. They connect the tube to a giant vacuum pump and suck up all the cash into garbage bags. Security guards investigate smoke from the explosion coming through the vents, but are diverted by Earl (Charles Halford), a customer at Clyde's bar. Jimmy accidentally reverses the direction of the vacuum, sucking Clyde's prosthetic arm into the machine. Sam and Fish get the money out and into Jimmy's truck. On his way out, Clyde is recognised by Chilblain and is forced to knock him out. Clyde and Joe manage to sneak back into the prison disguised as firefighters. Jimmy makes it to his daughter's beauty pageant just in time to see her perform his favourite song, ""Take Me Home, Country Roads"" by John Denver. Jimmy then abandons the money and anonymously informs the police of its location. The heist, dubbed ""Ocean's Seven-Eleven"" by the press, is investigated by FBI special agent Sarah Grayson (Hilary Swank). She suspects Jimmy, Clyde, and Joe, but has no substantial evidence. Due to the unwillingness of Warden Burns (Dwight Yoakam) to report the prison riot, Chilblain's seemingly false eyewitness account, NASCAR driver Dayton White (Sebastian Stan) being high on energy drinks, and the speedway president being satisfied with the money's recovery and insurance settlement, the case is closed after six months. Joe is released from prison and returns home; he is surprised to find a garbage bag of money buried in his yard. Sylvia receives an anonymous donation for her clinic, and the inmate who orchestrated the riot receives an envelope of cash when he is released. It is revealed that Jimmy had filled extra trash bags during the heist, which he hid at the dump to retrieve later. Jimmy gets a job working in a store and buys a house near his daughter and ex-wife's home, he happily reunites with everyone at Clyde's bar. Grayson is continuing the investigation, and enters the bar working undercover to keep an eye on Jimmy, Clyde, and Joe. Also starring Jim O'Heir as Cal, Macon Blair as Special Agent Brad Noonan, and LeAnn Rimes as herself. Tatum is perhaps questionable but reasonable as the lead, Driver is good, and Craig is likeable as he puts on an American accent and looks like he's having fun. This caper has some amusing moments, with prison and NASCAR scenes that add to it a little as well, the script is made up of one-liners, and it gets your attention at the right moments, an alright crime comedy. Worth watching!",Logan Lucky
6,paul_haakonsen,"Interesting concept, but slow storytelling...",5,6 January 2019,"I wasn't sure what to expect from ""Logan Lucky"". I just stumbled upon it by sheer random luck and had the time to watch it. So I did.While I normally don't watch a lot of heist movies, I do indulged once in a blue moon. However, I didn't know that ""Logan Lucky"" was a heist movie prior to watching it though.I must admit that I found the execution of the heist to actually be fun and interesting to watch. That was definitely a new thing to the heist genre. I sure hadn't seen a heist done like that before. And on that account it was actually interesting to watch the movie.The movie as a whole just felt somewhat prolonged and it didn't really have all that much going on narratively, which made the movie feel like it was slow paced and dragging along. And that is actually the reason for me giving ""Logan Lucky"" a very mediocre 5 out of 10 stars rating only.It should be mentioned that they actually had some very interesting names on the cast list, which included Channing Tatum, Daniel Craig, Adam Driver, Seth MacFarlane and Katie Holmes. For some reason, then I will always associate Adam Driver with the emo man-child from ""The Force Awakens"", and it will be hard for him to shed that mantle. But I will admit to the fact that he actually performed interesting and well in ""Logan Lucky"".All in all, ""Logan Lucky"" is an entertaining enough movie for what it turned out to be. Just a slow paced story it has to tell.",Logan Lucky
7,Quinoa1984,Soderbergh's Southern-Fried 'Hot Rock'...,8,21 August 2017,"...or, on further reflection, a bit of The Killing in there, only if it was much less compact in its time. If Donald Westlake was still writing his wacky but sincere and dark-in-the-margins comic capers, he might write something like this. It's not some grand masterpiece for an auteur to return with, but then Soderbergh wouldn't do that in a million cinematic years. He just makes his movies and he always has done that, and people either come or they don't (I remember an interview with him where he said he considers himself quite lucky due to having so many failures post 'Sex Lies' before finally getting back on his feet in the late 90's and that he'd probably be done if he did that today, but I digress).The point is, it's another of his crime films, and it's among the more entertaining ones, full of charm and wit and a grouping of actors (*Introducing* Daniel Craig) who get to play pretend while at the same time inhabiting what is a very real part of the country for a lot of people: the NASCAR, John Denver/Bob Seger loving South Heartland where, you know, times are tough all over. Even Katharine Waterston, who at first I thought was superfluous to the story, adds to it as a nurse who provides free health care to West Virginians who ""don't like the word charity."" This is the kind of movie where every actor, whether it's Riley Keough or Seth MacFarlane (who my wife didn't even recognize until I told her after it ended), are having a great time and it shows. It's a movie that has some pep in it step, this almost (by design probably, Soderbergh's a weird motherf***er like that) in contradiction to at times a lot of long takes and shots that let the actors inhabit the frame and take over, whether they move around or not. And as its plot moves along we know that this won't be an 'Oceans', at least in the way that characters mess up or kinks in the character's heist go on, and a major part of the fun is to spot when it might happen or to try and keep up with what may be a red herring or a genuine slip-up or something that is both a tiny or major plant to pay off later on. Meanwhile the soundtrack rocks, and its not in a way that puts *too* much attention on itself, just enough that it gives set pieces and little moments a distinct energy (i.e. ""Roadrunner"" as we see a montage of the Speedway as Tatum describes the layout to brother Driver).And certainly has its issues - Hillary Swank is so the weak link it's astonishing - but is a filmmaker, like Edgar Wright earlier this summer with Baby Driver, having the time of his life playing in the genre sandbox while creating amazing comic characters that you can take seriously. It also certainly has moments that the filmmaker clearly means to make us cringe while recognizing the cringe factor... or at least one, when Jimmy's little girl is giving her talent show performance (looking like, though she's a little older, one of those Toddlers & Tiaras kids, totally freakish in the make-up with the hair and giant eyes), as everyone is moved by it and sings along to 'Country Road', and... is it meant to be a heartfelt moment or Soderbergh satirizing how the South, where he came from (Louisiana, close enough to where this is), has a big heart despite the moments that make one take a step back.But Soderbergh doesn't make this moment one that is easy to say 'This is SATIRE!' It doesn't work like that for him either: this movie is all of a piece, as a shaggy crime story, the likes of which where the laziest (funniest) prison riot in movie history occurs involving a demand to the warden (there's another one, Dwight Yoakam!) that I won't mention here as it'd spoil a wonderful scene, while at the same time also a movie that is not subtle about its American commentary - both brothers are crippled in one way or another, one from Iraq, another from football, but so it goes - and also not shying away from having dumb but stubborn types. Daniel Craig might seem like one, but he's just having a blast a) being a real character actor again, getting to not be submerged in star power for a role like this (MacFarlane gets to do that too, and both swap accents), and b) the actors playing his brothers are ""those types"" we usually associate with rednecks... and they are, but there's a little more quirkiness there as well.I hope to check this out several more times over the years, maybe as soon as it hits video, and yet I also hope more people try to get to see it in theaters before it disappears; it didn't have a strong opening weekend, so in a sense it's Soderbergh going right back to where he was in the 90's, just doing what he does and experimenting in the form of cinema while also delivering the goods as an entertainer. Oh, and what a good writer ""Rebecca Blunt"" is. Ho-Ho.",Logan Lucky
8,tavm,Logan Lucky is quite a leisurely dramady about some low income people trying to pull a heist,7,28 August 2017,"This is another film directed by Steven Soderbergh who grew up in the same place I did, Baton Rouge, LA. That probably explains the LSU (not to mention the university's colors of purple and gold) reference at the beginning. Anyway, the lead character played by Channing Tatum gets fired from his construction job after his pre-existing condition is discovered while he also has to deal with his relationship with his ex-wife, his pre-teen daughter, and his one-armed (excuse me, one hand) brother (Adam Driver). So he resolves to pull a heist with the help of someone he knows from a prison cell played convincingly in a Southern accent by Daniel Craig. I'll just now say this isn't a bang-up action film, just a leisurely stroll through the lives of these lower-income people just trying to muddle through life. So that's a recommendation for Logan Lucky.",Logan Lucky
9,oscaralbert,This flick reminds us of why West Virginia is considered the USA's Most Russian State . . .,6,11 September 2017,". . . in case anyone has forgotten for an instant. LOGAN LUCKY's opening scene pictures ""Jimmy Logan"" as a West Virginian underground miner, losing his job because of a football disability. Recently released statistics from Football's Donated Brains Project prove that upwards of 99.5% of ex-football players have Brains of Mush. On a Per Capita basis, West Virginia is America's hardest hit state in terms of this Gridiron Catastrophe. Rampant brain dysfunction has led to WV suffering from the lowest levels of Education, Income, and Unionization in America. West Virginia has had more large scale (that is, 100+ fatalities) mining calamities than anywhere on earth, topping Russia, China, and South Africa's combined total. To add insult to injury, the tops of all the scenic mountains that would be State or National Parks anywhere else have been scraped away by giant mining machines in West Virginia. LOGAN LUCKY depicts West Virginia as a lawless, crime-ridden enclave overseen by inept and corrupt government officials, just like Russia. If you enjoy viewing squalid wastelands where anything goes, then LOGAN LUCKY is a ""must-see"" for you!",Logan Lucky
10,george.schmidt,"Fun, funny and frequently off-centered brilliant caper flick - One of the year's pleasant surprises.",9,26 September 2017,"LUCKY LOGAN (2017) ***1/2 Channing Tatum, Adam Driver, Daniel Craig, Riley Keough, Katie Holmes, Seth MacFarlane, Farrah Mackenzie, David Denman, Charles Halford, Jack Quaid, Brian Gleeson, Hilary Swank. Fun, funny and frequently off-centered brilliant caper flick centered around two brothers (Tatum and Driver continuing to prove less-is-more in their low-key turns) from West Virginia who concoct a scheme to rob the NASCAR racing event in North Carolina by enlisting incarcerated explosives expert Craig (ditto) and a cast of unlikely cohorts including Keough as a sharper than she appears beautician and a nearly unrecognizable MacFarlane as a foreign racer with ego to spare. Filmmaker Steven Soderbergh cooks the genre to a low-simmer with a shrewd and tautly amusing screenplay by Rebecca Blunt with some truly unexpected moments of poignancy (adorable Mackenzie as Holmes & Tatum's daughter's rendition of John Denver's ""Country Road (Take Me Home)"" will have you well-up).

11,view_and_review,"Fun, Funny, Forgettable",6,14 March 2018,"This was the lesser known movie of 2017 with Logan in the title. The other one--simply titled Logan--was a lot better. Not that this movie was bad, in fact it was quite fun and funny, but not at all memorable.A down-on-his-luck West Virginian is looking to change his fortune so he decides to rob Charlotte Motor Speedway, home of the Coca-Cola 600. He solicits the help of his brother, his sister, a prison inmate and two other local yokels. Like any robbery things will go awry and it's about staying ahead of the unexpected.The movie is nicely done and is somewhat clever. I think the patriotism of the movie outshines anything else really. The most lasting impression of the shots of the Coca-Cola 600 were the military, the flyovers, the flag and the entire singing of America the Beautiful. That was shown more than any actual racing. This movie was American and they let you know. Not just regular 'Merican but good ol' down south 'Merican with John Denver songs about West Virginia and moonshine. We're talking NASCAR, Fords, Chevys and veterans that gave limbs for their country. They even made sure to make the Brit the prick in the movie. Now that's love for your country right there.The movie was light and provided laughs like I said but nothing memorable.",Logan Lucky
12,neil-476,Entertaining caper movie,8,8 May 2018,"Jimmy Logan, sacked for having a knee injury, finds himself planning a robbery together with his brother, sister and an explosives person who is currently in jail.That is a sketchy synopsis of a fairly involved caper movie. Set in Virginia hillbilly territory, the characters are all drawn broadly as fairly dumb and possibly even inbred hicks, with the exception of the Logans: Adam Driver's one-armed Clyde edges around caricature territory, but not to the extent of Daniel Craig's Joe Bang or his even more cartoony brothers Sam and Fish. Craig is amusingly billed in the credits as ""Introducing Daniel Craig"". In case you haven't worked it out from the names, this is a comedy.It's also a caper movie, and the caper is a complicated robbery. It's nicely set out and executed, and I think the mechanics of it all make sense. What makes less sense is why Jimmy takes some of the actions he does towards the end of the film. This was never explained - at least, not to an extent which registered with me - and was the only bit of the film which left me less than satisfied.Otherwise, this was thoroughly entertaining although, again, the morality of loveable thieves is questionable.",Logan Lucky
13,AlsExGal,Entertaining heist comedy,7,24 January 2021,"Down-on-his-luck Jimmy Logan (Channing Tatum) has just lost his job. Once he was a promising football player but an injury ended his career and now he's barely making ends meet. He decides to pull off an audacious robbery at the Charlotte Motor Speedway, and he recruits a motley gang to pull it off, including his Iraq-war-vet brother Clyde (Adam Driver), their hairdresser sister Mellie (Riley Keough), and an incarcerated explosives expert named Joe Bang (Daniel Craig).I was hesitant to watch this one. While I like heist films, and many of director Soderbergh's films, the ""southern fried"" milieu, coupled with the NASCAR setting seemed like something I'd rather avoid. I was pleasantly surprised that the movie doesn't dwell on mocking southern stereotypes, and the NASCAR elements are kept largely in the background. The performances are good, with Tatum and Driver making for believable blank-faced losers who are maybe a bit sharper than they let on. Craig gets the showiest part, with his hair bleached almost white and the outline of West Virginia tattooed on his neck. The heist particulars are intricate and interesting, but I had the feeling after finishing the movie that dwelling on the details for too long would make a lot of it fall apart. Still, this was better than expected, and an enjoyable time for those not expecting too much.",Logan Lucky
14,ferguson-6,Ocean's 7-11,6,17 August 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. When we think of public figures retiring, we typically accept that athletes, politicians and entertainers will no longer be honing their craft or grinding in their profession. Perhaps they will write their memoirs, or even dodge TMZ completely by spending their days fishing or playing golf. When Oscar winning film director Steven Soderbergh announced he was ""retiring"" from making movies after his 2013 SIDE EFFECTS, he simply transitioned to television (excellence in ""The Knick""). Most of us assumed it was only a matter of time until he returned to the medium that made him famous. This ""retirement"" lasted less than 4 years.When a line in the film describes it as ""Ocean's 7-11"", we can assume this is Mr. Soderbergh admitting that his ""Ocean's"" trilogy was the inspiration for this comedy-satire heist film focusing on a well-planned crime by a team of siblings, rednecks and convicts. Channing Tatum, Adam Driver and Riley Keough star as the Logan clan – Jimmy, Clyde, and Mellie, respectively. With NASCAR as the target, the Logans are joined by the Bangs: Sam (Brian Gleeson), Fish (Jack Quaid), and Joe (a scene-stealing bleached blonde Daniel Craig).Joining in the unconventional Hicksville fun are Katie Holmes and David Denman as Jimmy's ex-wife and her new husband, a recently shorn Sebastian Stan as a race car driver, Seth MacFarlane as an obnoxiously rich blow-hard, Katherine Waterston in a too-brief role as a traveling medic, Hilary Swank as a determined FBI Agent, and Dwight Yoakum as a prison warden who rarely admits a problem. Also playing a key role is the music of John Denver  a move that teeters between tribute and punchline.The set up and characters lend themselves to more laughter than we actually experience. There are more awkward moments than hilarious ones. As examples, brother Clyde's (Driver) artificial hand is the center of focus on a few occasions, as are Joe Bang's (Craig) expertise in science, and the small town West Virginia addiction to child beauty pageants. Their racetrack robbery plan is both ingenious and preposterous, which is also a fitting description of the film.A writing credit goes to ""Rebecca Blunt"", which in keeping with Soderbergh's tradition, is a pseudonym (or nom de plume) for an unnamed writer (likely Soderbergh himself). The film mostly succeeds in delivering the opposite of the traditional Ocean's slickness, and it's entertaining to watch Channing Tatum and Daniel Craig (the credits list him as ""introducing Daniel Craig) having such a good time on screen. While it doesn't deliver the laughs of FREE FIRE or TALLADEGA NIGHTS, it is nice to have Soderbergh back where he belongs. Rather than an instant classic, it's more likely to be remembered for Soderbergh's attempt to change the movie distribution channels  Google can provide the details if you are interested.",Logan Lucky

It's a pity though because I enjoyed the rest of the movie, where a bunch of rednecks try to commit the perfect heist. The heist itself is a bit complicated, and would never work in real life, but it was entertaining to watch. The cast was also good, with good acting from the entire crew, so I can't really fault anyone for that either.

17,Hellmant,About as entertaining as you can imagine a redneck version of an 'OCEANS' movie being.,8,23 August 2017,"'LOGAN LUCKY': Four Stars (Out of Five)The new heist-comedy from director Steven Soderbergh, his first film in almost 4 years (after officially retiring). The script was written by first time feature screenwriter Rebecca Blunt (although some suspect that's an alias for someone else), and the film stars Channing Tatum (who's acted in Soderbergh's last four theatrical films now), Adam Driver, Daniel Craig, Riley Keough, Seth MacFarlane, Jack Quaid, Brian Gleeson, Katie Holms, Katherine Waterston, Hillary Swank and Dwight Yoakam. It tells the story of three siblings plotting to rob the Coca-Cola 600 race (in Concord, North Carolina), during Memorial Day weekend. It's received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, but it's also underperformed at the Box Office so far. The movie feels a lot like a redneck version of an 'OCEANS' movie (which Soderbergh has said was his main reason for coming out of retirement to do it), so it's about as entertaining as you can imagine that being.Jimmy (Tatum), Clyde (Driver) and Mellie Logan (Keough) are three hard working siblings in Concord, North Carolina. Jimmy believes that the three's current bad luck is due to a family curse. Hoping to reverse the curse, Jimmy plots a very complicated robbery; which ends up taking place at the Coca-Cola 600 race (on Memorial Day weekend). The entire preparation, and execution, of the robbery plays out just like a redneck version of an 'OCEANS' movie (like I already said).The film is funny, and it's definitely cleverly written and competently directed. The performances are all good as well, especially Daniel Craig (and it's nice to see him giving a great performance outside of a Bond flick). The heist is a little too overcomplicated though (like the 'OCEANS' trilogy), but it is fun to watch (even if it's hard to keep up with at times). I like Steven Soderbergh films, but I think he's just a little too much 'style over substance'. The characters are all well developed in this though (like all of his movies), but maybe just a little too cartoonish and clichéd at times (like a lot of his films are as well). It's pretty much everything you'd expect from a Soderbergh movie, and nothing more. So it that sounds good to you, you'll probably enjoy it.Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/j_XDrmlMJNY",Logan Lucky
18,thesar-2,Lucky Number Steven,8,3 September 2018,"Not by the Ocean, but still just as Lucky.Talk about downsizing and still achieving the same results. Please, don't show this to my upper management. A friend recommended this to me when my/our love for Director Steven Soderbergh and his Ocean's trilogy came up. I'm a huge fan of Soderbergh's, but not all of his work. This one, truthfully, wasn't one of his best and for the first 90% of it I was onboard but not as enthused as his other projects. And then, he had to go there. He had to elevate this in the last 10% for me to honestly be a complete fan.A down on his luck but high on heart dad vows revenge on his old boss and simultaneously take care of his estranged family by robbing his previous employment. No coincidence here, but he's gotta get a ragtag crew together and not everyone's playing friendly-crooks...or with a full deck.It's nice Soderbergh can take someone like Channing and humanize him and make the Magic Mike like one of us. Worked for Bruce Willis, but not so much The Rock or Arnold Schwarzenegger. And boy, he didn't just turn the hunk into Every Man, he truly created real-life people doing truly human things to set up this world.This isn't a straight-forward heist movie. It's very comedic, thoroughly enjoyable, plot-twisting and has an unbelievable amount of heart when you didn't expect it. Let's just say it was hard for me to contain myself when one song was sung to an audience.HIGHLY recommended, even for non-Soderbergh fans as this isn't his usual caper. Or film.***Final thoughts: Say what anyone will about Soderbergh or some of his films...If I were an inspiring filmmaker, there would be no other director I would go to and try to live up to. This is a master and I think he's so highly underrated and in the shadows, it's a crime.",Logan Lucky

Jimmy hatches a plan and puts together the ""best"" team West Virginia has to offer.The wife and I seem to rarely agree on what to watch, but the other night we decided to give Logan Lucky a go. Overall, we enjoyed it. It's good fun, has some interesting plot points, provides a few very funny moments, and features some solid acting - what more could you ask for? With any heist movie, you can expect a fair share of plot twists, but when you know so little about the actual plan as in Logan Lucky, you're in for a lot of surprises. Logan Lucky's heist is a lot smarter than it first appears. Don't let these backwoods robbers fool you. They're clever. Logan Lucky doesn't just feature a twist at the end - instead, we were treated to a twist on top of a twist with an extra twist thrown in for good measure.Another big plus for the movie is the acting. It's a large cast, but with the exceptions of Katie Holme, all get a chance to shine. Channing Tatum, Adam Driver, Riley Keough - all are rock solid. But by far the highlight is Daniel Craig. James Bond as a backwoods safecracker - it's a blast! There's an infectious sense of fun in Craig's portrayal of Joe Bang (love that name). At first, I was afraid the accent might annoy me, but, with a twinkle in his eye, Craig pulls it off. And the pair playing Craig's brothers, Jack Quaid and Brian Gleeson, steal every scene they appear in. Finally, there's something I always enjoy about watching Dwight Yokum act. He doesn't disappoint here. In fact, I'd like to see a whole movie based on his character, Warden Burns. The one performance that really didn't work was Seth MacFarlane. The character was about as grating as that British accent.Our biggest complaint is that the movie felt like it ran a bit too long. A little editing might have gone a long way to making Logan Lucky something truly special. An easy fix would have been to cut out any of the bits with MacFarlane and take care of two problems in one go.7/10",Logan Lucky

21,Pjtaylor-96-138044,No-frills yet fairly daring; its earthy quality and folk-tale fun screech to a halt in the final third.,6,21 February 2018,"Playing out almost as a less professional, backwater 'Ocean's Eleven (2001)' with simple-minded folk trying to pull off a no-frills yet fairly daring heist under the radar to support themselves the only way they know how (since most of them are disabled in some way), 'Logan Lucky' is a story mostly told without any embellishments and a real earthy quality that runs opposite to the slick trend usually seen in con-capers of the kind. It's entertaining until the third act screeches to a halt and the picture runs along for far too long after the main event has been and gone. The flick instead chooses to take its time winding-down until it tries to inject some unnecessary intelligence in a forced revelation that does nothing other than hurt the piece. Soderbergh tends to get distracted by peripheral elements that take too much screen-time with too little impact to be relevant. The motivations for all the characters are paper thin, too, and they're never fully realised so it all ends up feeling a little pointless. It is consistently fun, though, and never as predictable as it threatens to be, but it's odd that the director chose to come out of retirement for something other than the best heist thriller he's ever made. 6/10",Logan Lucky
22,ThomasDrufke,Cauliflower,9,1 September 2017,"That's now two movies this year with Logan in their title that have made their way into my top films of the year. Of course, it's entirely a coincidence, but perhaps Logan truly is lucky Okay, a poor joke sure, but Logan Lucky is definitely one of the best films of the year. It has the Soderbergh personality mixed with the humor of a Coen Brother's film. That's a winning formula.It also helps that Soderbergh tends to get the absolute best out of his actors. Think about Jennifer Lopez in Out of Sight (which I just recently watched), I don't think she's ever been better in a film. The same could be said for some of the actors in Logan Lucky. Channing Tatum plays a recently jobless father who puts together a plan to rob the Charlotte Motor Speedway with his siblings and a few hardened criminals. Tatum's performance is mostly reserved, but the few moments of real emotion are powerful enough to give the film a poignant undertone.Seems strange in a film where Soderbergh makes law enforcement look like untrained animals to have poignant moments, but that's certainly the case here. Sure, I joke about the way he portrays law enforcement, but I actually found the entire town to be more than entertaining. Soderbergh establishes the setting of West Virginia seamlessly here and makes it known just how tightly knit to each other these people are. All of these things make Logan Lucky quite the thrill ride.Let's talk about that script though. Written by ""Rebecca Blunt"", which is clearly a pseudonym for Soderbergh's wife, the script is perfectly timed out with action beats and comedy flares that it could rival Ocean's Eleven as Soderbergh's most entertaining film to date. Yep, you heard me.Rounding out the cast is Daniel Craig, Adam Driver, Riley Keough, Katie Holmes, Seth MacFarlane, Katherine Waterson, Sebastian Stan, and Hilary Swank. You best believe that each of them give a memorable turn as their respected characters. As a whole, Logan Lucky delivers laughs, cheers, and even a few heartfelt moments, all while making one of the most entertaining heist adventures of the last few years.9.1/10",Logan Lucky

The characters alone are a lot of fun to watch, and when you mix in witty humor and a clever plan, it's a good time for anyone.

24,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,4,14 November 2017,"Logan LuckyMost criminals know that when you steal from NASCAR you are stealing from Jesus himself.However, someone failed to tell the morons in this comedy about NASCAR's number one fan.Recently laid off Logan (Channing Tatum) concocts a plan to rob his former employee: Charlotte Motor Speedway, by intercepting the money capsules that move through the facility via tubelines. With help from his brother Clyde (Adam Driver), two dimwitted hackers (Brian Gleeson, Jack Quaid) and a safecracker (Daniel Craig), Logan hopes that the caper will reunite him with his estranged daughter. Instead it sets off a wild chain of events.Despite its stacked cast and an accomplished director in Steven Soderbergh, this comedic heist is light on laughs and heavy on annoying characters, highly improbable situations and monotonous pacing. In fact, Driver's dopey accent discredits the entire production. Worse, when you steal from NASCAR your punishment is to watch NASCAR. Red Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",Logan Lucky
25,The-Sarkologist,Another Cookie Cutter Heist Film,4,21 August 2017,"Once again I'm not really all that sure why I saw this because even though it is a heist movie, it pretty much follows the cookie cutter script that seems to be the standard for heist movies. In fact I saw another heist movie earlier this year that was almost identical except that the main characters were pensioners who had been diddled out of their retirement as opposed to a bunch of hicks whose injuries have resulted them being left on the scrap heap, and when I say almost identical I actually mean literally scene for scene.Okay, I was going to say word for word, but that doesn't really work considering the previous film was set in a major city (New York I think) where as this is set in Charlotteville, North Carolina. Okay, they also have a prison break, and they robbed a speedway as opposed to a bank, but the way the film progressed, especially with the police investigating it and then coming up empty, and the protagonists (anti-heroes if you will), getting away with it. Mind you, it was pretty clever what they did, and how they covered their tracks, but the funny thing is that these guys didn't actually come across all that smart. Also, there were some pretty cool laugh-out-loud moments, at least for me.One of the things that did stand out was the setting – Charlotteville, and it was rather ironic that the whole protests occurred the week or so before I saw this film because it really gave me an idea of what the culture is like down there – very working class. In a way it created a picture of a region of the United States that had been ravaged by globalisation, and a world where if you are injured then nobody wants to touch you, or hire you. In fact our hero was basically told that he could no longer work because he had a pre-existing injury, which was the catalyst for the whole heist.While I would suggest that it was a fun movie, the reality is that there wasn't really all that much different here than the film that I saw earlier in the year (Going in Style). Sure, the setting was slightly different, and the way they went about committing the heist was different, but in the end it seems like it simply came out of a cloning factory and really had little to no substance, or thought, to actually making it an individual film (except for a couple of really cool jokes that is).",Logan Lucky
26,Reno-Rangan,Prison break and the heist!,8,24 February 2018,"The film entirely remained below the rhythm, but there's an audience for such film. Despite I'm not one of them, I enjoyed it. Because it looked simple. They did not try too much, just to impress the viewers. Especially not in the mood to surprise. So I watched thinking it's a straight plain heist film. But then the end revealed more than what I'd expected. You can call that the twist. That came in an unusual way.The story of two brothers whose lives are not making any progress. Especially when one of them loses the job and now in the cusp of completely losing custody of his child, decides to rob in an unusual place. So his brother and sister joins, along with a most famous robber who is now serving his final days in the prison. How it all works and ends were told in the final quarter with some intense thriller.The cast was awesome. I mean, if you are a cinephile, there's no reason you could avoid it from watching forever. But when you do, you might regret for being late. It was fun, though not out and out comedy. Especially I liked the ending. Because, initially I thought, the narration had too much flaws. But then they all covered it by giving good reasons. I might have rated it a bit high, but surely it is not an average film. I definitely want a sequel. From none other than the same writer, director and the cast. That means I favour it for others to check it out.8/10",Logan Lucky
27,tomgillespie2002,"Welcome back, Steven Soderbergh",6,11 December 2017,"When Steven Soderbergh announced four years ago that he was giving up the director's gig to focus on TV, did anyone actually believe him? There was a cry of sadness from critics and audiences alike, but nothing about his announcement felt like it would last for very long. How could a man so prolific in recent years and as equally comfortable tackling a star-studded major release as he is with low- budget indies distract himself away from the temptation of the director's chair? As expected, Soderbergh is back for his first film since 2013's Behind the Candelabra, with a heist comedy described as Ocean's Eleven for the NASCAR crowd, and more amusingly, Ocean's 7- 11. Logan Lucky doesn't find the director on unfamiliar ground, but it's a welcome reminder of how fine a storyteller he is.The Logan family curse stretches back as far as the remaining members can recall, and things look to be heading downhill for Jimmy Logan (Channing Tatum) when he is sacked from his construction job and informed by his ex-wife (Katie Holmes) that she plans to take their daughter and her new husband miles away to Lynchburg. Jimmy's brother Clyde (Adam Driver) has returned from Iraq minus an arm and a sense of humour, and only hairdresser sister Mellie (Riley Keough) appears to have dodged the curse. Enough is enough for the once- promising footballer Jimmy, who plans to end the curse once and for all by robbing the Charlotte Motor Speedway. Key to the success of the job is colourful safe-cracker Joe Bang (Daniel Craig), but he currently sits in jail five months away from his release. With a few tricks of his own up his sleeve - and a comprehensive list of dos and don'ts stuck to his fridge - Jimmy aims to break Joe out, pull off the heist, and return him to his cell before anyone notices he's gone.With fantastic performances all round from a hugely talented cast and a witty, pacy script by Rebecca Blunt, Logan Lucky is one of the most effortlessly watchable movies of 2017. The film is predictably stolen by an off-the-leash Daniel Craig who, with a buzz-cut of peroxide-blonde hair and a drawl so ridiculous it actually works in favour of the character, seems happy to be free of the high-octane stunts and extensive promotion tours that come with the role of James Bond. There are also nice smaller turns from the likes of Katherine Waterston as a good-natured nurse and former schoolmate of Jimmy, Dwight Yoakam as a prison warden eager to avoid any bad publicity, Sebastian Stan as a disgruntled, yoga-freak NASCAR driver, and Hilary Swank as a shrewd FBI agent. There are bad performances too, namely from Joe's idiotic brothers (played by Brian Gleeson and Jack Quaid) who aren't nearly as funny as the film believes they are, and Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane donning a distracting English accent and even more distracting hair-and- moustache combo.It's fun, breezy and confidant in all the ways Ocean's Eleven was, only here the characters are more dim-witted and less easy on the eye. It's happy to dabble in the kind of stereotype dreamt up by outsiders, and while this helps with the appeal of Craig's larger- than-life lunatic, it also means that much of the comedy is derived from people saying and doing stupid things. Every now and then however, Soderbergh reminds us why he has been so missed, even when he's dishing out mid-table fare like Logan Lucky. Few directors can bring a heist to life with such detail and excitement - he doesn't let you in on the plan, so we have no idea just how this will pan out - and even fewer could make the site of a prosthetic arm being sucked up into a huge vacuum quite so hilarious. But the movie's high-point comes when Jimmy arrives at the last minute to witness his daughter sing John Denver's 'Take Me Home, Country Roads' to an enamoured pageant audience, and heart-strings are unexpectedly tugged. It's a shame that more of the movie can't quite live up to that scene's standards and helped to gloss over the other flaws, but for now it's certainly a ""welcome back, Steven Soderbergh.""",Logan Lucky
28,cruise01,Logan Lucky is entertaining and funny in a way. But a welcome back to Soderbergh's direction.,9,1 September 2017,"Logan Lucky is fun filled with stupid humor and an entertaining direction that is brought to you by the director that did Ocean's 11 films. Steven Soderbergh directing another film after his so called retirement in the industry does bring a good welcome back to his heist comedy film. It is like Ocean's 11 meets The Dukes of Hazards in a way. What worked about the film is it has plenty of stupid fun filled humor. It may not have jokes being thrown out in every scene. But more of oddball characters making idiot decisions or more inside joke humor. The setting takes place in the West Virginia, were every acting talent takes the advantage with southern accents. And some stupid redneck type of humor. That is what made the film worked so well is the characters are entertaining. Jimmy Logan (Channing Tatum) a construction worker that gets laid off for liability reasons is forced to rob a speedway race event in order for him to have enough money to afford a lawyer. He is in a custody battle about trying to make the best for his daughter, while his ex Bobbie (Katie Holmes) living a high class privilege lifestyle and having their daughter walk in a beauty pageant. Then, there is Clyde (Adam Driver) who is Jimmy's brother, and lost his hand in war. His ego is shut down without his hand. He aids in helping his brother rob the speedway. Which they would enlist an explosive expert convict Joe Bang (Daniel Craig) who has five months left in prison. But the brothers want to break him out for a short time to complete the heist and bring him back in. The plot is fun. If you have seen any of the Ocean's 11 films you may get a feel for how the movie is. Where every scene that plays out with characters doing a specific action in order to put this heist in motion. Then in the end, every thing is tied together with a twist. Soderbergh does well with his storytelling in making heists films which is what he is strong at in filmmaking. The characters are all fun oddballs. Channing Tatum was great. Adam Driver was good. Daniel Craig was an interesting one, playing a convict with bleached hair and an indifferent accent. Riley Keough playing the Logan's sister, who seems the most reasonable intelligent character. Katie Holmes playing the high class lifestyle character. Katherine Waterston has a small appearance which is fun to see. Seth MacFarlane as the arrogant businessman is fun. And Sebastian Stan playing one of the race car drivers and his ""clean freak"" of eating healthy and comparing his body to an operating system is funny. The one minor thing that did not work with the film is I feel like the pace slowed down in the final act. When we have detective Sarah (Hilary Swank) trying to solve the robbery. And the exposition with every character after their heist. Overall, Logan Lucky is a really good heist comedy film that is a lot of fun with the odd characters. The cast ensemble was great. The humor was stupid and fun. Steven Soderbergh's direction was kinetic and fun for a heist movie. Every scene was entertaining and smooth moving with the characters. It does slow down in the final act for everything to catch up with the exposition. Nevertheless, it was fun entertainment. I rate the film 4.5 out of 5 stars.",Logan Lucky
29,Floated2,Quite different heist film,7,16 December 2018,"Logan Lucky has been praise and haled by critics during its release, though audiences seem to have slightly different opinions. As this film was quite a box office flop and did not make much profit and in general noise as expected by the cast, director and overall crew of the film. Logan Lucky only made $48 million on a $29 million budget yet currently has a 92% on Rottentomatoes and 78 on Metacritic, as we knew something must have went wrong with the promotion for the film.Perhaps this film was released at the wrong time, as it was released during the summer of August on the same day as surprise hit the Hitman's Bodyguard.About the film, it was quite different than what expected, as though it is nicely paced, great directing and the overall cast of the crew has well chemistry with one another. Although one did not find the film too funny as some critics, there is a natural sense of humor throughout.It is intriguing all the way through. Channing Tatum, Adam Driver both have great chemistry and Daniel Craig arguably steals his steals playing a different character than his typical norm. Seth MacFarlane also provides several laughs in his role.Hilary Swank also provides several late scenes in the end, as her character is rather the weakest link and quite annoying as she brings the film down in some sense. Also to note, the very end may have been signaling a set up for a sequel. as we see her at the bar where Clyde Logan (Adam Driver) works. Had this film been successful, perhaps, we would have seen more.Another reason as to why this film is quite fun is that it doesn't take itself too serious, it's light hearted at the right moments making for fun. Perhaps a reason as to why this film didn't bond too well with general audiences, are that many people are turned off by southern accents.

30,eddie_baggins,Oceans Eleven done redneck style,7,21 August 2017,"In 2001 polarising director Steven Soderbergh unleashed the A-list filled heist caper Ocean's Eleven into the marketplace.A fun, fast and knowingly self-aware experience that spawned a rather forgettable trilogy, if Ocean's Eleven was Soderbergh's Rolls Royce heist caper, Logan Lucky is his billy-kart redneck version, filled with just as many A-listers as his George Clooney lead feature's and in many ways a film just as enjoyable as his 2001 film, even if it's unlikely to ever be remembered by many in the years to come.Coming out of a retirement that never felt like the real deal, what exactly possessed Soderbergh to return to Hollywood and recruit one of his as per usual star studded cast's for a crime comedy set in the Deep South and centred on robbing a Nascar speedway we will never know and while Logan Lucky won't ever be regarded as a classic or even a member of the director's best works, it's unlikely that there'd be many that wouldn't find themselves having a great time with the seemingly cursed Logan family and their quest to strike it rich.Capturing the feels, vibes and small little eccentricities of the Deep South, Soderbergh does a great job of setting up the time and place that sees Channing Tatum's divorced ex-football protégée Jimmy team up with his one armed Iraq veteran brother Clyde, played by Adam Driver and his hairdressing, car loving sister Mellie played by Riley Keough to rob the local Charlotte Motor Speedway and strike it rich, as the family recruit a rag-tag bunch of fellow locals that includes Daniel Craig's explosive loving and incarcerated Joe Bang and his two dim-witted brothers.It's a motley crew and Soderbergh and his actors have a blast bringing them to life with everything played straight, making the films few big laugh sequences really stick (a scene involving a giant vacuum will have you in stitches), even if it at times feels like Soderbergh could've amped up the slapstick variety of comedy a little bit as the heist gets into full swing.Despite the film arguably not making the most of its comedic potential at times, it's always fantastic seeing such a capable collection of actors having such a good time and with the likes of a hamming it up Seth MacFarlane and bit parts from Katie Holmes and Hilary Swank, it's hard not to enjoy Soderbergh's big screen return, that really is unlike anything we've seen before and offers a fresh take on the well-worn dumb criminals trying to make it rich sub-genre.Final Say – Whilst forgettable in the long run and highly unbelievable, Logan Lucky is a smartly attuned heist caper that features a willing and on-song cast of professionals who help bring this redneck crime comedy to life and while his not breaking any new ground, its good if these are the type of film's Soderbergh's making while back in the Hollywood fray, films only he wants to make, like no one else can do.3 ½ unpublished Game of Thrones books out of 5",Logan Lucky
31,leonblackwood,Expected Better!,4,13 February 2018,"Review:
I was really looking forward to watching this movie, after seeing the crazy adverts with Daniel Craig, and the impressive cast but I was extremely disappointed with the outcome. It takes way too long to get going, and the heist made them look like a bunch of dumb criminals but the relationship between Jimmy Logan (Channing Tatum) and his daughter was quite emotional. The ending was cleverly put together by the director but after watching nearly 2 hours of the movie, I lost interest. Anyway, the film is about an upcoming football player, Jimmy Logan, who is forced to become a miner after getting injured. Now separated from his High School sweetheart, Bobbie (Katie Holmes), he regularly sees there little girl Sadie (Farrah Mackenzie), who lives with Bobbie and her new husband. After getting sacked from work, Jimmy puts together a plan to rob the Charlotte Motorway Speedway during a NASCAR Race, with his brother Clyde (Adam Driver) and sister Mellie (Riley Keough). They soon realise that they need a safe expert to get to the money, so they hire Joe Bang (Daniel Craig) for the job but the only problem is..... he's in jail. With time against them, Jimmy and Clyde manage to break Clyde out of jail for the duration of the heist, with the help of other inmates but the robbery doesn't go according to plan. Without the rest of the crew knowing, the Logan brothers cooked up there own secret plan to make sure everything goes smoothly but they have to lay low because the cops are hot on there tail. I must admit, it is a unique storyline, done in the theme of a Oceans Eleven movie but the characters were doing strange and crazy things throughout the movie, which made the heist feel ridiculous and unrealistic. The only aspect of the storyline which I could take seriously was the morals behind the heist, from Jimmy's point of view but it all seemed a bit too easy to me. From an entertainment point of view, you just want them to get on with it, especially after such a big build up, and when they eventually attempt the heist the whole plan seemed a right mess. Anyway, I wasn't that impressed with the movie but I'm sure there's people out there that would have enjoyed it. Disappointing!Round-Up:
After retiring from directing movies, Steven Soderbergh, 55, decides to direct this movie, after being so impressed with the script. He first directed Access All Areas in 1985 and then he returned to make Sex, Lies and Videotape in 1989. He also brought you Out of Sight, Erin Brockovich, Traffic, the Oceans Eleven franchise, Solaris, The Good German, Che, The Informant, Contagion, Haywire, Magic Mike, Side Effects and Behind the Candelabra, which have all made him a big player in Hollywood. In this movie you don't really get to see true genius behind the storyline until the very end, when the true story unfolds, which is just like his Ocean movies when he reveals how the heists truly took place. It was good to see Daniel Craig out of his Speedo's and sharp suits, and it was also good to see Channing Tatum as an everyday working father, without stripping of his clothes on stage, so from that point of view, the director showed a different side of the actors but it wasn't enough to save the film. I'm still not sure what the ending meant, when the officer walked into the bar but with that aside, it's a straight forward heist movie which gets the thumbs down from me.Budget: $29million

32,TheMovieDiorama,"Logan Lucky is a lighthearted, fun and, most importantly, entertaining comedic heist.",7,28 February 2018,"Sometimes it's good just to sit back, relax and enjoy some silly antics on screen. Fortunately, a welcome return from Steven Soderbergh allows us to have a good laugh whilst being moderately entertained. Much like his Ocean's trilogy (but with less class and suaveness), it's another heist. Set in the backdrop of a NASCAR race, two brothers employ the assistance of an experienced vault opener, who is currently incarcerated, to steal a heck load of dollar. We've seen these types of films before, in fact probably far too often...but is that a bad thing? No. In an age where studios feel forced to create depressingly epic franchises, it's a breath of fresh air just to watch something dumbed down for a change. I liked it. Straight off the bat, the cast is the strongest element. Channing Tatum proves once again that he can act, Daniel Craig looked like he just had a absurd amount of fun (rather contagious might I add). But the standout was a one handed Adam Driver who is really impressing me as of late. There are several cameos (MacFarlane, Stan, Swank and Waterston) which for me detract from the story and authenticity of the film. However, good performances all round. My adoration for Soderbergh continues once more, extremely well directed and perfectly shot. He is ever so reliable and I'm glad he has come out of retirement to make another film. Screenplay was mightily enjoyable with plenty of comedic moments thrown in to bring out some chuckles, particularly a scene that involves gummy bears. The script was witty and humorous, again couldn't ask for more. My problem was with its third act. I wish the film ended sooner. It just kept dragging and dragging and I could visualise in my head my rating was dwindling lower. The second act was so fast and exciting that it just accumulated to nothing which was a shame. Also the motives for the robbery were ambiguous and felt petty. Adjust to the West Virginian accent and you are in for a memorable entertaining comedic heist.",Logan Lucky

34,matthewssilverhammer,Soderbergh: King of the Crime Comedy Caper,9,24 August 2017,"For 25 years, Soderbergh (Ocean's trilogy, Traffic) was one of the most prolific and lauded filmmakers of the turn-of-the-century. After a four year ""retirement"", Logan Lucky proves he hasn't stalled a bit. With dashes of Shane Black and the Coens, it's a redneck Ocean's Eleven (""Ocean's 7/11"", according to the movie) which replaces tailored suits with ratty southern rock t-shirts. It's another twisty, cool, hilarious heist movie that cements Soderbergh as king of the comedic-crime-caper. Tatum and Driver play a pair of down-and-out brothers who've discovered a fool-proof opportunity to rob a racetrack. Throughout the humor and the crime, Soderbergh gives a great representation of income disparity and the modern American class system that actually warrants its soundtrack's use of ""Fortunate Son"". It would make Bernie Sanders proud; however, despite it's having a clear point-of-view, it's never forceful. The movie is as interested (if not more so) in the soul of its characters as their politics. This gives room for the story to envelope, the humor to shine, and unexpectedly moving moments seep in. Tatum's relationship with his daughter and even a group singalong of ""Country Roads"" bypass the corniness under Soderbergh's heartfelt care. It's a shame this isn't making much money at the box office, but it's not surprising either; it has ""cult-sleeper-hit"" written all over it. The performers are entertainingly cast against type (Craig's roughneck southern boy is wonderful), there's a cavalcade of non-sequiturs and one-liners around each turn, and it takes about 15 minutes to find its unique tonal rhythm. But once you're with it, and the dry hilarity hits you, you'll be glad you were lucky enough to find it.",Logan Lucky
35,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"""Ocean's"" redneck cousin, but that's not a bad thing",7,5 December 2017,"Steven Soderbergh eases back into filmmaking with ""Logan Lucky,"" a quintessential heist comedy in the exact vein of his ""Ocean's"" films. For a filmmaker known for his edgier film choices and a distrust of the studio system, he's made what one would otherwise guess was a bona fide Hollywood product. With minimal promotion and marketing, chances are most viewers who discover ""Logan Lucky"" will wonder how they missed a caper starring the likes of Channing Tatum, Daniel Craig and Adam Driver.The Logan siblings Jimmy (Tatum), Clyde (Driver) and Mellie (Riley Keough) believe they're cursed, but it doesn't stop them from deciding to pull off a heist at the Charlotte Motor Speedway. When Jimmy is laid off from a construction gig repairing sinkholes under the stadium, he uses his knowledge to formulate the heist. He and Clyde then recruit local incarcerated bank robber/explosives expert Joe Bang (Daniel Craig) and his brothers and together, they hatch a plan to spring Bang from prison, pull off the job and get him back in prison all in a day.The screenplay from mysterious pseudonym Rebecca Blunt does a nice job taking the viewer by surprise. The film generally seems to operate at surface level, but then makes a series of reveals at various points throughout the story that remind you not to underestimate, in the same way these West Virginia country boys who've encountered failure shouldn't be underestimated either. It's a smart film about people we perceive to be dumb, and that gives the actors (especially Craig) license to go off the rails a bit.The performances contain a good energy and sufficient nuance that avoid stereotypes, but ""Logan Lucky"" chiefly operates as an entertainment vehicle. Not much about it plays to the emotions except that Jimmy has a daughter with his ex-wife (Katie Holmes), who plans to move their family out of state and make it difficult on the cash-strapped Jimmy to have a relationship with her. But this subplot is only lightly tethered to the thrust of the story — the heist — and doesn't round out the film as much as it would like. The film also has plenty of other subplots and ancillary story components involving prominent actors such as Seth MacFarlane and Hillary Swank in minor roles. These are meant to suggest an elaborate and creative story design, but the film never justifies their use all that well. The casting has more of a whiff of ""look at all these actors who jumped at the chance to work with an un-retired Soderbergh.""Soderbergh's fans will be probably appreciate his return for one reason or another, but nothing about ""Logan Lucky"" suggests it wouldn't have been just as good with a lesser name. He does know how to add touches and flourishes that excite and energize a story like this, but he's far from being the distinctive filmmaker he's been at times.Other than not to underestimate rednecks, ""Logan Lucky"" appears to have some things to say, though they ring with varying levels of clarity. The Logans' notion of bad luck doesn't feel particularly poignant, but the way the film calls out corporations and people in position in power for wanting to sweep their own misfortune and wrongdoings under the rug is what really resonates. In some ways, ""Logan Lucky"" isn't about the heist as it is the aftermath, but let's not mistake that at its core it's a film looking to deliver a good time and it succeeds.~Steven CThanks for reading!

36,imseeg,From the same director who gave us Ocean's Eleven,8,20 April 2018,"Channing Tatum, Daniel Craig and Adam Driver play 3 southern dumb hillibilies who plan to pull off a heist during a Nascar race. Will they succeed?Logan Lucky is a very enjoyable laidback heist comedy with enough interesting plot twists to keep me guessing HOW the heist was done till the very end. Enjoyable for all ages.The good: Acting in particular is hilarious, but done seriously nonetheless. I hate it when actors don't take their characters seriously, even in a comedy, because it undermines the credibility. The leading roles by Channing Tatum, Adam Driver and Daniel Craig fortunately DID take their acting seriously. They were topnotch! It was a real joy to see those 3 act as real dumb southern hillibilies. Or werent they so dumb after all?Any bad? Logan Lucky has a laidback charm to it, that made it even more enjoyable for me, but maybe some might mistake this slowburning tempo for boring or lacking in action, which it was. There is not much action. It is all about ""silly"" heist plans. It is quite an intelligent plot, I personally still dont understand some of the details of the heist, but that didnt stop me from enjoying it any less.Praise to director Steven Soderbergh, he pulled it off again. Cant help but comparing Logan Lucky to this director's previous heist movies, because Steven Soderbergh was responsible for the succes of the very first Ocean's Eleven. In the movie there is even a witty reference to Ocean's Eleven when the heist in Logan Lucky is called ""Ocean's Seven Eleven"".Is the plot of Logan Lucky as spectacular as Ocean's Eleven? No, but it is a good contender. The smart and funny story was actually written by the wife of director Steven Soderbergh, using a fake name of Rebecca Blunt, which is listed on Imdb as a writer with only 1 script to her name, how mysterious...",Logan Lucky
37,subxerogravity,It was a great heist movie,8,20 August 2017,"It's a very interesting perceptive on the heist movie. It was so different than ones that I've seen before and I like that a lot about it. It takes a little adjusting cause the movie just feels so mundane. Logan Lucky is just so straight forward than what I'm use to when it comes to these crime movies. I can't help but to watch the movie and expect more to happen, more conflict or obstacles, but the plot was great without any extra fluff. It is a lot like Soderberg's Ocean's Eleven, not as flashy, but with another set of wacky characters. Channing Tatum, was awesome in this movie. He plays Jimmy Logan, a down on his luck single dad living for his daughter who needs some big money when he losses his job and his daughter's mother is moving them to another state. So he decides to rob the raceway on the busiest day of the year.Adam Driver is in the movie as well and he was nice and funny. Some great laughs from him. Daniel Craig was funny as well.Steven Soderberg is a very good director and it was great seeing his spin on the whole crime heist picture. It's not my favorite Soderberg movie but it's a good experience.http://cinemagardens.com",Logan Lucky
38,jtindahouse,A lot of fun but it all feels a little too easy at times,7,27 December 2018,"'Logan Lucky' is a very similar film to the 'Ocean's Eleven' trilogy. Both were directed by Steven Soderbergh, both are heist movies and both follow a similar formula. Whilst I did like 'Logan Lucky' (a lot more than I thought I was going to after a very boring first 30 minutes or so) the problem I had with it was that everything goes too smoothly. Much like 'Ocean's Eleven' we are never fully let in on the plan until the end, but in 'Ocean's Eleven' the difference was that little problems kept cropping up that made for both hilarity and clever ingenuity on the character's part. There was a little bit of that in 'Logan Lucky' but no where near enough for my liking. When it was over I couldn't quite believe that that was that.The movie started off very slowly and really never had any scene that gripped me until roughly the 30-45 minute region. once the heist begins though the movie does pick up a lot, and the second half of the movie has much better pacing and is actually a lot of fun to watch. It does all get a little complicated and you really have to be paying attention, otherwise you are likely going to get lost. And as for the final scene of the movie - I have no idea what that was about.A strong cast, a smart script and some good second half pacing are the strengths this movie possesses. It's weaknesses are a lack of conflict, a slow start and perhaps never having that one moment that blows the audience away. I wouldn't call 'Logan Lucky' a must-watch, but it is a slightly above average film that you're more than likely going to have a good time with.",Logan Lucky
39,jamesrupert2014,OK tongue-in-cheek caper comedy,7,5 December 2019,"A couple of brothers, one of whom thinks the family's hexed, set up an elaborate heist at the local speedway. The film follows the standard 'heist trajectory': identify the target, assemble the team, make the plan, do the job, deal with unexpected events, reveal the 'twist' ending. The entire premise is pretty far-fetched and there are more coincidences than a tightly written caper story would need but the story is entertaining, the cast great and the script and characters amusing. Best enjoyed without taking your brain out of park.",Logan Lucky
40,stevendbeard,Quirky Heist Movie,7,19 August 2017,"I saw ""Logan Lucky"", starring Channing Tatum-The Magic Mike movies, She's the Man; Adam Driver-Girls_tv, Star Wars:The Force Awakens; Riley Keough-It Comes at Night, Magic Mike, Oh Yeah, she is Elvis' granddaughter and Daniel Craig-He is the latest James Bond, Lara Croft:Tomb Raider.This is a weird, oddball heist movie that is directed by Steven Soderbergh-Magic Mike, Haywire, Ocean's 11, 12 & 13. I say weird and oddball because it is entertaining but is is also a little off the wall. Channing and Adam are redneck brothers that have lots of bad luck running through their family-Logan is their last name, hence the title of the movie. Riley is their sister. After loosing his latest job, Channing decides that it is time to change his family's luck by creating an elaborate plan to steal money from NASCAR during a race. They need help so they enlist Daniel, an explosives expert and just like in any good heist movie, things go right and things go wrong and the audience is left wondering if they will pull it off or not. There are lots of recognizable stars in small roles-I wouldn't say cameos because they keep popping up throughout the movie. I remember seeing Katie Holmes, Seth MacFarlane, Dwight Yoakum, Sebastian Stan and Hilary Swank. During the end credits, when they usually say something about no animals were harmed during the making of this movie, it says 'No one was robbed during the making of this film, except you,' Oh yeah, they also use a Lord Sutch song during the end credits-how oddball is that? I mean how many young people even know who he is?-I can just hear them googling, now. This movie is not for everyone but I liked it. It's rated ""PG-13"" for language and has a running time of 1 hour & 59 minutes. I like movies that are a little quirky at times and I would probably buy this one on DVD.",Logan Lucky
41,alindsay-al,A good fun film,7,8 September 2017,"I liked the trailer for this film so I decided to watch this film and I did enjoy it even though it is unspectacular. The premise of the film sees a group of hillbilly's attempt to rob a NASCAR race for there own reasons. Channing Tatum plays the lead in this film and he is really good in the film, it is a different role to what were used to seeing from him but he delivers in the role with good charisma and likability. Adam driver plays his brother in the film and he continues to show why he is one of the best actors around. He gives a different performance that is really entertaining to watch, which is helped by his and Tatum's chemistry being really good. Daniel Craig is in this film as a crazy bank robber and it is such a fun performance which is so different from what I have seen from him. He is really over the top but he does provide the funniest moments in the film. Seth McFarlane is really funny in this film playing an arrogant rock star that will annoy you and make you laugh throughout the film. Shoutout to the girl who plays Tatum's daughter does a really good job in the film and has a bright future ahead of her. The story in the film is fun and entertaining to watch as these people try to come up with a way to do this heist. But I feel like the emotional reason for the robbery wasn't really emphasized enough and it kind of makes you wonder why you are rooting for these character's. The script has some really funny dialogue in it that I will admit had me laughing quite hard at times. But as mentioned before I don't feel the dramatic dialogue was handled very well to make me care more. The style of the film is entertaining to watch and I always like a good heist style. But the pacing of the film is a bit off, the film is longer then it needs to be and there are some side plots that could have been cut completely From the film. Overall this film isn't going to be for everybody but I enjoyed it and think it is worth a watch.",Logan Lucky
42,iquine,A Good Old Boy Heist,9,9 March 2018,"(Flash Review)This movie knew what it was and it added a properly toned and clever twist to end it off. Most movies in the silly crime action genre are mediocre at best. This one stands out as two down home brothers plan an overly-intricate heist during a large NASCAR race. This exceeded my expectations as the appropriately quirky characters were nicely developed and it hit the mark with its comedic tone. Adam Driver was one of the brothers with a partial amputated arm/hand, Daniel Craig brought a wacky spark to the movie and Tatum actually didn't play his stereotypical pretty boy roll and did a fine job. Overall, it was entertaining and it sufficiently engaged me enough to care about the plot and characters.",Logan Lucky

Realising they are unable to pull off a heist of this magnitude by themselves, they recruit expert safe-cracker Joe Bang to assist. Trouble is Joe is in prison meaning the brothers need to figure a way of springing Joe from prison before they can really set their plans in motion...It's hard to believe that Logan Lucky is a film that has been directed by the same man that brought us the fantastic Oceans 11 remake around 20 years ago. As far as I'm concerned, this film lacks many of the components of the aforementioned film; it's not exciting, it's not particularly slick and isn't really all that interesting. Perhaps the only thing running in the film's favour is the plot developments (some of which are quite clever), but much of the film is delivered in a mechanical manner lacking in both flair and panache.Daniel Craig's introduction and character show promise to begin with (he's shown to be a little unhinged), but this aspect of his character is toned down quite a lot as the film progresses meaning he's never quite as interesting or quirky as I would have hoped.Although the performances from the main crew are generally good I couldn't really take to Seth MacFarlane's character or his performance; he doesn't feel necessary to the story and comes across as annoying (I still maintain that MacFarlane is a good voice actor, but not a particularly natural physical actor).I've given the film some credit because the motivation behind the heist isn't entirely motivated by greed and the film does boast some amusing moments; although the chemistry between the cast does seem to be a bit hit-and-miss.As I've said Logan Lucky isn't terrible by any means, but anyone expecting anything close to Oceans 11 in terms of quality is probably going to be a little disappointed by this offering from Soderbergh.",Logan Lucky

Each new veiwing just gets better and better, and with each new viewing you pick up on something you hadn't before. The characters are witty, perfectly flawed, oddly relatable, and surprisingly ethical, which makes the heist they're attempting to pull off even better.",Logan Lucky
46,myriamlenys,sure to become a classic heist movie,9,7 August 2018,"Both funny and suspenseful, ""Logan Lucky"" is an enormously entertaining movie with good direction, good writing and good acting. I especially liked Adam Driver, as a one-armed war veteran turned barkeeper, and Daniel Craig, as a professional criminal with a talent for safe-cracking. By the way, is there anything Daniel Craig can't do ? I would not be surprised if he played Ivanhoe, Little Eva or Djenghis Khan - and nailed it.There's many a heist movie where the heist itself looks and sounds as though it was thought up between two diet cokes by the brother-in-law of the props guy, but here you've got quite a lot of clever ideas rolled into an intelligent, twisty plot. Moreover, great care was taken to situate the heist into a well-described cultural and geographical background.The viewer also gets some good jokes and gags. Watch out for the moment where two criminals are instructed to travel into the woods in order to contact ""The Bear"". When deep in the woods, they meet... Well, you'll see. It's a delightfully surreal idea. If you like well-constructed stories about (bank) heists, you might want to take a look at the recent Belgian television series ""De dag"", which boasts a very, very ingenious screenplay. Still, the general tone of ""De dag"" is far darker and grimmer, and I'm not sure if it has already been translated into other languages. (The original language is Dutch.)",Logan Lucky

48,aharmas,Never Understimate Anyone,9,10 September 2017,"It is almost a perfect fit having Sodenbergh at the helm of this film, a fun caper of what some might call the perfect crime. Cleverly put together and masterfully acted by the likes of Craig and Tatum, two reliable performers who have been giving us a share of delights in the last decade. Somehow, overshadowed by others, there's no chance of that happening here, and both draw attention to their respective characters. Tatum's is low key and earns our sympathies early in the story. It's hard to believe that he is the driving force behind the plan. He walks around as if always hurting, an open heart who lives solely to make sure his kid is a happy child and does her best considering she spends her time between two separated parents.The mood is set right from the start when one can see the beautiful connection these two share. Having her clarify whether he needs a flat head or a Phillips screwdriver is one of the most heartfelt moments of the year. There is also a strong bond between the two brothers, and it is also full of quiet interactions. It also becomes clear during their exchanges who is the smart one in the family, who is the leader, and who is the follower.The plan requires the involvement of the Craig character, a expert in explosive devices who needs the right incentive and challenge to join in. He does his part, treating those along the way to a series of very interesting and salacious remarks. He has a twinkle in his eye and irradiates a charm that is hard to fight. He has his connections and peculiarities, and all of them are put to good use while executing the robbery.There is plenty of humor when we see the various exchanges between the different characters. We have seen people like these before; but we haven't quite seen them do the things they come up here. Everything feels real and though some of their lucky moments might make us raise an eyebrow, we cheer for them. There are the require obnoxious stereotypes, but even those are likable. The tone remains constant, the pay off seems justified, and well, do we end up with a happy ending? That's to be decided both on and off screen.We only hope that all these parts of the delightful whole are recognized at the end of the year because Tatum delivers and Craig tops himself in one performance that is so such a transformation, we know we are witnessing really good acting. There is a powerful force complimenting his shocking exterior. It's hard to believe this is the man who walks around in those expensive suits and wouldn't be happy with his gin fixed anyway but the one he prefers.",Logan Lucky

Seriously, Driver may be one of the best actors working these days and this one definitely shows some of his range.I feel like this needs another watch, it was fun and I definitely liked it but there was something there preventing me for getting 100% sucked in to the experience.

Daniel Craig is superb, I love how he can slip in to different roles and Channing Tatum is my Spirit Animal so he can never do any wrong in my eyes.

I think if one is going to make a story of this type up it helps to have the ingredient of humor. This one has that element woven well throughout. The story itself ,though somewhat sensational, reels itself in to keep just enough credibility to have a feel of something possible. Again, this helps immensely. Then there's the setting and the characters which breathes some freshness into a well worn genre. Now I'm not going to tell you that Daniel Craig as a southern talking backwoods legendary criminal would be the obvious choice so just watch and see if he doesn't slip into this role better than one might ever imagine. The exaggerated woodsy drawl used by many of the actors is just another thing that often fails yet works right into the comedic part well. Soderbergh got a good story, a great cast, and worked it into a better movie. Adding stuff like having Dwight Yoakum as the prison warden and Hilary Swank as the dogged, but stuck, FBI agent is pure gold. Tatum Channing does his role justice by not overplaying which is when he hits a sweet spot. All in all this is an enjoyable ride.",Logan Lucky

Down on their luck brothers Channing Tatum and Adam Driver decide they're going to pull off a heist at a NASCAR event. Like all good heist films, the story revolves around putting together a team of colorful characters, the most colorful of which is a Daniel Craig as an explosives expert named Joe Bang, who the brothers have to bust out of jail to pull off their heist, and as with nearly all heist films, things do not go as according to plan. To share more would ruin the fun of the film, which has less to do with the story and everything to do with the colorful characters and the snappy dialogue. Also appearing in the film are Katie Holmes, an unrecognizable Seth MacFarlane as a hilariously obnoxious NASCAR driver, and Hilary Swank as an FBI agent investigating the heist. There's also a peppy score by David Holmes, who scored all three of Soderbergh's Ocean films. I'm always fascinated by Soderbergh who easily goes between arthouse films like ""Sex, Lies, and Videotape"" ""Kafka"" and ""King of the Hill"" but can also deliver wonderfully entertaining mainstream films like ""Magic Mike,"" ""Out of Sight"" or ""Haywire"" (Soderbergh is also for some reason a producer on ""Bill & Ted Face the Music""). ""Logan Lucky"" falls into that later mainstream category, but in all of those mainstream of films Soderbergh brings an intelligence and wit to these formula films and makes them something special, avoiding lazy cliches.

A recently laid off construction worker and his brother attempt to pull an seemingly impossible heist and rob a NASCAR Race with the help of an explosives mastermind and his no so-mastermind brothers. There is a Hollywood elitist attitude toward the 'red neck' states that permeates a great deal of the movie. The one development which is particularly annoying is Tatum's daughter who is eager for him to see her in one of those ""little miss Carolina"" contests. The movie would have us take this for laughs, but in reality, this is a very degrading and depressing institution to put your child in.The best parts in the movie belong to Daniel Craig. Looking like a bull on the edge of going rampage, he doesn't look like he would have any brains, until he gives a bewildering cue card lecture on how he made a bomb out of candy. this is one of the two funniest scenes in the movie The other involves a hostage taking situation in a prison where the prisoner make highly unreasonable demands in an attempt to distract the warden.Soderberg's direction is fairly low key.

57,jadepietro,A Heist in Hee Haw Heaven,8,22 August 2017,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5) GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A good heist film with a nice sense of hee-haw humor.SYNOPSIS: A heist film comedy...country style.JIM'S REVIEW: A redneck comedy about a heist gone wrong, Logan Lucky is damn lucky to have an expert director at the helm and a fine cast that makes this escapist fare work. The film follows the genre's formula pretty closely, but Steven Soderbergh injects the film with some comic gusto that is mostly on target and casts his film with actors willing to play the fool.Now Steven Soderbergh is no stranger to this crime drama genre, having directed the Ocean 11 films. Back from a short retirement, he has made a movie that celebrates all of the hallmark elements of crime and absurdity. No, it doesn't come anyway near his master works like Traffic, Michael Clayton, or the underrated Contagion. But it doesn't try to reach that zenith. This is a highly entertaining caper movie with enough droll wit and irony in large helpings. One can hark back to an earlier time when the good ole boy comedies of the 80's variety frequented the movie houses, that country fried action flick that made Burt Reynolds a bundle of money.￼Getting that big bundle of money is also the main goal in Logan Lucky, by any available means, mostly illegally, in this scenario. Life has not gone particularly smooth for Logan Brothers. Not very smart and with a run of bad luck in their miserable lives, these white trash siblings are thought to be cursed. Jimmy (a wonderfully appealing Channing Tatum) is divorced and recently laid-off. Clyde (an amusing Adam Driver), a war veteran with a prosthetic hand, runs a seedy bar. After a chance encounter, Jimmy hatches an elaborate scheme to rob a raceway of its NASCAR loot. They assemble a motley crew of misfits to set their plan into action.￼Everything is slightly askew in this story, from the dopey antics of its colorful characters and their over-the-top Southern accents to the dense plotting that depends solely on happenstance. The narrative defies logic. Mr. Tatum's character is pure country rube, yet he becomes a criminal mastermind who can easily work out any kinks in this elaborate scheme of riches. That said, the storytelling keeps one's involvement throughout the film, making Lucky Logan complete fun.Credit the good screenplay by Rebecca Blunt and an adroit cast. The heist itself, with its clever twists, is always compelling. The aforementioned Mr. Tatum and Mr. Driver make a great tag team. Solid supporting turns are given by an ensemble that includes Katie Holmes, Riley Keough, and Dwight Yoakam. Also making memorable cameo appearances are Hilary Swank, Seth MacFarlane, and Katherine Waterston. Jack Quaid and Brian Gleeson provide the wonderful corn-pone humor. However, the most enjoyable award goes to Daniel Craig as Joe Bang, a safe-cracker and an unsafe cracker with a penchant for risky behavior. He turns in a delightful comic performance just this side of caricature.￼The talented Mr, Soderburgh directed, photographed, and edited this caper film with such effortless skill. He captures that red state mentality and unabashed patriotism with his subtle images while focusing on the complex crime caper and its quirky characters. In Logan Lucky, all of the characters' flaws and foibles are charming Southern comfort. So grab a beer! Let's hear it for the boys! Yee-haw!",Logan Lucky
58,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Logan Lucky,6,22 August 2017,"Remember when a great actress gave a bad performance? I do. It was in 2013's Elysium with Jodie Foster projecting acting 101 as a humanoid, secretary of defense. In Logan Lucky (my latest review), Hilary Swank does the same thing. The multiple Oscar winner delivers her lines in a robotic manner playing Special Agent Sarah Grayson. Now was her screen time in ""Lucky's"" last twenty minutes completely necessary? I'm thinking no. Anyway, Logan Lucky's story involves two brothers (played by Channing Tatum as Jimmy Logan and Adam Driver as Clyde Logan) attempting to rob the Charlotte Motor Speedway. Tatum's character has a limp in his leg and Driver's character has one arm. They are almost broke, they are down on their luck, and they really need the money. Tatum and Driver on a quest to secure many garbage bags full of dough, are surrounding by a host of troupers. You have an unrecognizable Daniel Craig (safecracker), an unrecognizable Seth McFarlane (British businessman), an underdeveloped Katherine Waterson (love interest), and a goofy Dwight Yoakam (prison Warden). Everyone sort of fades in and out of ""Lucky"" making it the equivalent of a holed, cinematic blueprint. Steven Soderbergh is the director of Logan Lucky and well, he can still do pretty much anything. His Out of Sight is different than his Solaris. His Traffic is dissimilar from his Full Frontal. Finally, his Erin Brockovich is much more disparate from his 1999 picture, The Limey.On a different note, Steven is also a director who hasn't made a film in four and a half years. Supposedly, Side Effects was gonna be his swan song. Now in present day, he comes back with ""Lucky"" which for all things southern, is a drawled crime caper. Yeah it all feels too little, too late. Punch-drunk on the success of his Ocean's Trilogy, Soderbergh shoots ""Lucky"" in the vein of his Magic Mike. You can spot similar degrees of sliding camera-work and relaxed story-boarding. He then projects Logan Lucky as an Ocean's Eleven for the hick nation. Jotting between the settings of North Carolina and West Virginia, ""Lucky"" is like a less complex and certainly less drawn-out version of ""Eleven"". Logan Lucky's only hook mind you, is that it trades George Clooney and Brad Pitt for the middle class or should I say, the rural working class. You get to see (and hear) toilet seat horseshoes, John Denver tunes, dudes bobbing for pig's feet, and decorated cockroaches. At the same time, you leave ""Lucky"" wondering why it was even made or better yet, why Steven Soderbergh came out of retirement to make it. Heck, what was the point of it all really? Now I'm not saying Logan Lucky is a bad film because while watching it, I realized that Soderbergh hasn't lost his touch. His direction is streamlined and assured. Added to that, his actors for the most part, deliver and he keeps the proceedings moving with a nifty, breezy soundtrack (courtesy of mainstay David Holmes). In the end though, it just feels like his ""Lucky"" is a design for a flick as opposed to an actual feature. I suppose that's why things are left open for a Logan Lucky sequel. Based on ""Lucky's"" mediocre, opening weekend at the box office ($8 million), I just don't think that's gonna happen. My rating: 2 and a half stars.",Logan Lucky
59,rannynm,"Logan Lucky – Great Plot, Exquisite Action Scenes And Comedic Jokes",9,25 August 2017,"This enticing film kept my eyes peeled for a full two hours. With such a divine plot, exquisite action scenes and comedic jokes, there is something for everyone to enjoy. The more you watch it, the better it gets. Set in West Virginia, Jimmy Logan (Channing Tatum) works at the Charlotte Motor Speedway as a heavy equipment operator. Unfortunately, he loses his job because of a leg injury. Trying to reverse a family curse of failure and poverty, Jimmy Logan works with his brother Clyde (Adam Driver), his sister Mellie (Riley Keogh) and his friends Joe (Daniel Craig) and Fish Bang (Jack Quaid) to rob the Speedway. Channing Tatum portrays Jimmy exceptionally well, especially his desire to never give up. When the robbery needs to be moved up a week earlier in the midst of the Coca Cola 600 on Memorial Day weekend, those events do not stop Jimmy from attaining his goals. Clyde Logan plays an Iraq war veteran who lost an arm and is very inspirational because he doesn't let it affect his everyday life. Mellie Logan is the beautiful hairdresser who acts as a motherly figure to Jimmy's daughter, Sadie (Farrah Mackenzie). Sadie is a confident girl who competes in beauty pageants and wins the audience over with her priceless smile. Every character is quite unique, so you are sure to relate to at least one of them. Since the film is set in West Virginia, Southern accents are evident. It is great to see a film set in such a different social atmosphere. I enjoyed hearing the accents and it made me wonder if those same people might think California accents just as fascinating. My favorite part is when Jimmy uses a self tanner on his daughter. I am surprised that his ex-wife Bobbie Jo (Katie Holmes) allows this, since she is very strict and has full custody of their daughter. Sadie puts a bathing suit and goggles on while she tanning and it is hilarious. The messages in this film are never give up, work with others and stay true to yourself. These are very inspirational, because the robbery couldn't have taken place without a tremendous amount of teamwork and responsibility. If you want to achieve something, go for it, if that is what you truly want to do. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18. Since there is alcohol use, it is most suited for teens and adults. Go see it and find out if the Logans are truly lucky. Reviewed by Samantha M., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",Logan Lucky
60,Kingslaay,Logan Lucky,7,19 August 2017,"Logan Lucky was an entertaining film. The comedic heist involved a range of interesting characters with decent back stories. The film executed its film and central premise quite well. It contained the right dose of comedy so you didn't take the heist too seriously. However the film could have been funnier, it had enough ridiculous characters to take it to another comedic level. The scene with Daniel Craig explaining the science behind explosions was a touch of genius. The team of misfits or unusual characters added a great level of comedy and entertainment. It also had a great twist at the end when we learned that Jimmy Logan had in fact put away several bags of cash to divide it among his family and associates. We also saw a relentless FBI agent follow the gang to the very end. The film also had a nice, lazy and southern feel to it. It showcased classic country music and showed simple folks and simple living.If the film had taken that extra step in terms of comedy or sentimentality or both it could have been more enjoyable as it had the right elements. It is a good night at the pictures but the film is somewhat forgettable. The cast more than carry this film as we see some great performances. 7.5/10",Logan Lucky
61,yoggwork,the country bumpkin robbery,6,18 February 2019,"If the lines say, the country bumpkin robbery. There are still loopholes in the plot, and the rhythm is too slow for a robber movie. There are too many cushions before and after, and too few small orgasms in the middle.",Logan Lucky
62,bkrauser-81-311064,Off at the Races!,8,19 August 2017,"Logan Lucky is first and foremost a heist movie. Arguably it's the first of its kind this decade, since the last time a really good movie of this stripe has focused on downhill good 'ol boys pulling an all-American snatch-and-grab, Burt Reynolds was still relevant. In its advertising the film mentions itself in the same breath as Ocean's Eleven (2001) but aside from both having the same director, the two couldn't be more miles apart. One's about career confidence men drinking fancy martinis. The other's about petty criminals snatching chump change from concession drawers. One's essentially Michael Caine, the other is Steve Martin.As such, Logan Lucky doesn't come with the standard beats and rhythms of your average Italian Job (2003). It's slower, quirkier, meanders down narrative avenues then calls it all back in drastically different ways. While doing so it's also more human, more sympathetic calling to mind the best aspects of The Big Deal on Madonna Street (1958) with a uniquely Appalachian twang.Recently let go from his construction job due to, ""liability reasons with insurance,"" former football prodigy Jimmy Logan (Tatum) decides to put in motion a robbery plan he's obviously been thinking about for some time. He recruits his siblings, hairdresser Mellie (Keough) and one-handed bartender Clyde (Driver), to aid him. Then they knock on the door of infamous local demolitions expert and safe cracker Joe Bang (Craig) whose incarceration proves the first snag of many to rob the Charlotte Motor Speedway.As with all heist movies, much of the entertainment stems from the tension created when the plan, as described to the satisfaction of the audience deviates ever so slightly risking exposure. What Logan Lucky doesn't just get right but gets near darn perfect is the way it plays with that convention. Large problems seem to wash over the ensemble with increasing grace almost as if they know they can rely on their community; family and own God-given intelligence to carry the day. Minor problems come across as inspired character moments for which Jimmy, Joe Bang and his brothers (Quaid and Gleeson) show their goofy, simple, superstitious selves.I say goofy and simple not to be derivative, though if that's what you take from it then the film's prestige may come as a more pleasant surprise than you could hope for. Much of the plan relies on other characters, such as a stuffy prison warden (Yoakam) and a haughty race promoter (MacFarlane) to underestimate our ensemble's abilities.The film does an excellent job humanizing our heroes by exploring and framing their environments as a point of fact. Jimmy doesn't live in squalor; he lives in a cozy house overlooking the West Virginia hills. Clyde isn't a one-handed freak, he's a war hero and a dedicated bartender to boot, Mellie, a capable getaway driver, the Bang brothers - professional bandits who ""know all the twitters"". The camera further highlights this by panning and gliding at low angles making everyone loom larger; everyone including a late third act addition in Hilary Swank as a resourceful FBI investigator.The film is not without its faults. The pacing seems to shift up and down like a Mustang barreling down the Eastbound I-64. And despite its knack for air-tight alibis, Logan Lucky leaves the audience hanging with a lot of unanswered questions. Given the controversy surrounding the financing of the film, there's little doubt a sequel is being planned. One which I look forward to, but if film is said to be poetic justice in a hundred minutes or less, Logan Lucky doesn't come across as poetic as it should be.All that said, Steven Soderbergh's Logan Lucky is a breeze. It's a fine and feral addition to the pantheon of good time slice-of-life crime comedies that were first kicked off by Dirty Mary Crazy Larry (1974) and the like. And its quirkiness is helped immensely by its motley cast who by enlarge do wonders humanizing characters that otherwise would have been shrouded in misplaced mythos. If you've been curious about this one, do yourself a favor and check it out.",Logan Lucky
63,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Logan Lucky""- Another delightful comedic heist picture from the director of ""Ocean's Eleven.""",10,25 August 2017,"Perhaps the biggest surprise treat of the summer 2017 movie season, ""Logan Lucky"" seemingly came out of nowhere despite having a top- notch cast and cinematic mastermind Steven Soderbergh at the helm. With almost no marketing push behind it, it was a film that barely anyone knew existed before it was quietly released just a few short weeks ago. Yet it has somehow gone on to become one of the most acclaimed comedies of the year in terms of critical reception and has been steadily growing an ever-building fanbase as more and more people discover it. And I for one am glad I gave it a chance, seeing it in a spur-of-the-moment decision based merely on seeing the poster in the theater lobby, because I just flat- out adored this movie start to finish. With sharp visuals, great characters and a quirky and off-kilter sense of humor, ""Logan Lucky"" is right up there with my favorite films of the year.Jimmy Logan (Channing Tatum) just can't seem to catch a break these days. He's divorced from his ex-wife Bobbie Jo (Katie Holmes), he keeps missing out on major events in his daughter's (Farrah Mackenzie) life, and he's just been fired from his job due to a bad limp that makes him an insurance liability. Until one night, when he hatches a plan to turn his financial woes around- he crafts a brilliant scheme to pull off a major heist at the same North Carolina NASCAR track where he was just fired from his construction job. But there's a catch: he needs to assemble a crew of like-minded goofballs to pull it off, including his troubled one-handed war-veteran brother Clyde (Adam Driver) and an incarcerated demolitions expert who calls himself ""Joe Bang."" (Daniel Craig in a scene-stealing performance)This is a film built entirely on the interactions and development of characters placed into extraordinary circumstances, and ""Logan Lucky"" completely excels on all fronts. Every single performer involved is giving it their all, and everyone does a fantastic job with the phenomenally amusing characters created by screenwriter Rebecca Blunt. Tatum and Driver are both incredible and play off each-other exceptionally as two brothers who love one-another despite their differences and sometimes conflicting personalities. The film wisely gives them both a lot of sympathy and flaws so that the audience never turns against them, and despite what they're doing being completely illegal, you'll quickly find yourself rooting for them. Supporting roles by the likes of Mackenzie, Holmes, Riley Keough and even a small turn by Hillary Swank are all played very well and lend a lot to the proceedings. And of course there's Daniel Craig... Fans who only know him as the latest James Bond might very well want to check this movie out, because Craig shows just how versatile and talented an actor he really is- he is the highlight here, and gives one of the most amusing and entertaining performances of the year.The storyline Blunt crafts serves as a great groundwork for director Soderbergh to develop on, and the movie is very well constructed and paced. Soderbergh's eye for keen visuals and slick composition is on full display, and the film is quite the aesthetic treat, making good use of its Southern setting and the NASCAR related imagery, which helps build both mood and tension. In many ways, you could say that ""Logan Lucky"" is the ""redneck"" variation of his earlier ""Ocean's Eleven"" trilogy- and I don't mean that in a bad way at all. It's quirky and character driven with fantastic direction and beautifully crafted imagery. Soderbergh also wisely lets scenes play out at an organic pacing, so the razor-sharp writing is on full-display, and the constant and very effective subtle humor is allowed to sink in. It's infectiously charming and even if you don't laugh out loud at every scene, you'll definitely find yourself grinning ear to ear and giggling madly throughout.There really isn't a single thing I can say to the film's detriment. It's a perfect, well-oiled machine that knows exactly what it is, and places all of its focus on being the best it can be. And it's incredibly refreshing at the end of a summer season that was filled with a lot of enjoyable but flawed works and a fair share of duds. Great characters. Fantastic performances. Wonderful and witty writing. And classy visual direction. Four key ingredients that come together and make ""Logan Lucky"" one of my favorite films of the year. I have no choice but to give it a perfect 10 out of 10. If you're on the fence, please give it a shot. Little films like this are invaluable and deserve a lot more exposure than they get.",Logan Lucky
64,denis888,Very Catchy,8,16 December 2017,"Steven Soderberg certainly knows a thing about makinf heist movies, so this one, Logan Lucky, is a very purposefuly slow-pacing criminal comedy with a brilliant cast of such celebrities as Channing Tatum, Daniel Craig, Hillary Swank, Adam Driver among many. The pacing in fact is very carefully calculated and the very tempo is accurate. This is a very sweet heist movie and thus it sucks you in, gets you invilved and makes you very thrilled and actually highly amused and entertained. The soundtrack is a huge winner with all the awesome tracks scattared here and there and therefore adding a certain sheen and gusto to this well-crafted film. A sure nod to Ocean's Eleven, it still is an original cup of tea and goes its own amusing course quite well. Not everyone will be amused with this film as many would find the pace and the message a bit boring, but this is the style, the genre, the essence.

The script is a bit of a mystery (who is this smart writer?) and with so much going on - not always easy to follow but, mostly good natured fun (well, sort of).

67,arungeorge13,A star vehicle that fulfills what it sets out to do in the first place! [+72%],7,22 November 2017,"'Logan Lucky' is a film that almost never sheds its 'hilarious' tag (have a look at some of the crazy credits for instance - ""introducing"" Daniel Craig as Joe Bang - holds true in a funny way. This is the rawest version of him yet, playing an in-car-ce-ra-ted safecracker, a sharp contrast to his suave-looking 'James Bond' persona) - it's an exhilarating ride for the entirety of its duration - a great comeback (from retirement) piece for Steven Soderbergh, directing from a smooth-as-silk screenplay by 'mystery writer' Rebecca Blunt (rumored to be Soderbergh's wife).A lot many viewers don't find Soderbergh films ('Contagion', 'Side Effects', 'Magic Mike' and the 'Ocean' series to name a few) to possess the conventional aspects of entertainment, yet they've all (or mostly) held their attention owing to his purposive film-making approach. He doesn't make ensemble-flicks just because he wants his posters to feature big names - there's always a strong screenplay and sensible craft backing their presence. Soderbergh treads familiar territory in 'Logan Lucky' - it's an economical ode to his Oceans' (heist) films, set in West Virginia (the accent comes with it!). The film presents the hapless situation of Jimmy Logan (Channing Tatum) in a funny (but non-offensive) manner - he has been laid-off from his construction worker job at the Charlotte Motor Speedway because he apparently failed to disclose an injury he suffered during his once-promising football career. He shares an adorable bond with his little daughter Sadie - he teaches her the essence of John Denver songs ('Take Me Home, Country Roads' - a neat touch that makes a lot of sense subsequently). When Jimmy realizes that his child and ex-wife are moving soon to another city (rendering visits difficult and less likely to happen often), he, along with his amputee bartender-brother Clyde (a bad- ass Adam Driver) and hair-stylist/make-up artist sister Mellie (a sensuous Riley Keough) enlists the help of Joe Bang (and his brothers Sam and Fish - almost unrecognizable Brian Gleeson & Jack Quaid) to break into the Speedway's money-stashing system.It is at this point that 'Logan Lucky' starts to appear like a bankrupt stepbrother to the Oceans' films - we have planning followed by execution. Craig's entry adds to the queerness - he consumes boiled eggs sprinkled with fake salt (laughed hard for that one - but we soon register the fact that even the slightest of touches attributed to characters add on to something bigger - for instance, watch out for how 'fake salt' plays a role in their heist later on). Not one scene amounts to filler in the film's run-time of 1h 56m, while the humor is unevenly sprinkled and pops up at the most improbable situations (there's a hilarious stretch where Joe expounds the chemical reaction involved in creating their 'explosive device, minutes before they set it off). Another favorite episode is the 'hostage situation' at the prison - George R.R Martin references apart from the jail-warden's ""We don't"" remarks, are bound to crack up even the toughest of nuts.Riley Keough is the jaw-droppingly seductive equivalent of Eiza Gonzalez from 'Baby Driver' - only more resourceful and having a meatier role to play in the heist. Soderbergh's well-thought-out writing is supplemented by neat frames (captured and edited by himself under different aliases) and a pleasing soundtrack. Cameos from Hillary Swank, Macon Blair, Sebastian Stan, Seth MacFarlane and Katherine Waterston are subtly placed. The hillbilly accent (for once) comes across as a whiff of fresh air rather than a turn-off device. Verdict: Surprise! Surprise! Soderbergh is back. And he's gonna be around for more.",Logan Lucky
68,Troy_Campbell,Middle of the road heist comedy.,5,20 August 2017,"'See how the other half steals' is a cheeky, but apt, tagline for this redneck heist comedy. Whereas Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's trilogy was all charm, glitz and high-class robbery, here the director puts a down-on-their-luck West Virginian family front and centre. Channing Tatum's Jimmy Logan is the George Clooney of the movie, except he's unshaven, has a potbelly and hobbles around due to a knee injury that stopped him going pro. But he has a heart of gold. His brother Clyde (Adam Driver) is the Brad Pitt of the piece, although he's socially awkward, has shaggy hair and can't let go of what he sees as a multi-generational family curse. And he only has one arm. Sister Mellie Logan (Riley Keough), local safecracker Joe Bangs (Daniel Craig, bleached blonde hair and a bit on the crazy side) and his hillbilly cousins Fish and Sam (Jack Quaid and Brian Gleeson) round out the crew. Their goal: to steal millions from a major annual Nascar event. How? By infiltrating the underground tube system utilised throughout the day to transport cash from all of the food and merchandise outlets to a secure vault. Tilting the comedy scales more towards low-key humour, Soderbergh tries to find a tone that is both tongue-in-cheek and flippant whilst also wanting to be taken seriously in parts. It's a risky move, and one that doesn't always pay off. Finding a way to relate to, or empathise with these characters isn't easy, hence there's no great desire to see them pull off their elaborate scheme. What's left is a mild intrigue to see the trickery on show, but it's a bit hollow without the investment in the key players. Props to Soderbergh for injecting a show-stopping beauty pageant sing-a-long in the final act; 11-year-old Farrah McKenzie (playing Tatum's daughter) singing John Denver's 'Take Me Home, Country Roads' is one of the most touching—and unashamedly American—scenes of the year. Some fine moments and an intriguing concept meshed in with a weird tone and uninteresting characters result in Logan Lucky being merely middle-of-the-road. Wait for a home viewing.",Logan Lucky

Seriously, laugh out loud? I think I cringed more than laughed at the attempted humour, which felt completely forced throughout.'Logan Lucky' is an easy movie to watch because it requires little effort or attention to follow. It's just your typical heist movie with a shallow and basic plot, perfectly watchable and to some degree enjoyable, but nothing that hasn't already been done before.

70,blott2319-1,"Entertaining heist film, but Soderberghhas done better",7,1 September 2020,"Logan Lucky feels like Soderbergh was trying to channel himself, and recreate the magic of Ocean's 11. That's not a bad thing, because I love his take on the heist genre in the first Ocean's film, and I am always intrigued to see what he will do next. In this one he mixes things up by having the entire team made up of rednecks in North Carolina. This did a lot to add to the humor of the film, as they aren't presented as your most suave or savvy thieves, but they have a solid plan. I only wish the film would clue us into that plan in a greater way. There are some fun reveals when they show how it was all done, but many of the extra twists don't feel like a big surprise since we didn't know how it was supposed to work in the first place. A little more thought put into the setup and pay-off would have made the entire film better.Another place where they made a mistake the other way (setting something up without paying it off) was in the rules for a robbery. This was a great opportunity to show our protagonists taking extra effort to abide by these rules, and then presenting how things could go wrong if they disobey them. While you can see, as the film progresses, that they thought about these things they rarely address them directly at all. This all sounds like I hated Logan Lucky, but in all honesty these flaws were only the minor things that kept it from being great. If I didn't know that Soderbergh was capable of a masterful heist film, then I might be a bit more forgiving. I still loved discovering the intricate details of the plan as they unfold, and I had a lot of laughs watching these goofy characters. The film might not have ended quite the way I like, but it was an enjoyable trip getting to that conclusion.",Logan Lucky
71,maurice_yacowar,Rednecks get away with a major heist -- for now.,8,23 August 2017,"Logan Lucky here means no luck at all. Well, maybe the odd but brief illusion of good luck.The redneck West Virginia family has a history of failure and disaster. But when the two Logan brothers, their sister Mellie and their con co-conspirators pull off a major heist, their luck seems to have changed. The Credence Clearwater song ""(I Ain't No) Fortunate Son"" expresses their upbeat energy but foreshadows their doom. Their success promises to be short-lived. The one-armed bartender Clyde seems about to be seduced by the pretty, dogged FBI officer Sarah Grayson who won't take ""Case Closed"" as an answer. Clyde (hangdog Adam Driver) is too nice, too vulnerable, too doomed, to resist her. Director Steven Soderbergh treats his white trash subject society with respect. The convict Joe Bang (the explosives expert, of course) has two standard issue moronic hillbilly brothers, but Joe himself is a brilliant intuitive talent with a solid foundation in science and an impressive strength of character. Ironically, Daniel Craig gets an ""And introducing"" credit at the end — for this is an all-new appearance for the reigning James Bond.These hillbillies include heroes. The brothers' patriotism cost them an arm and a leg. Clyde lost his arm in one of his two army stints in Iraq. The limp Jimmy incurred in service costs him his digging job at the racetrack. His ""preexistent condition"" is ""a liability issue."" That phrase explicitly places this comic heist in the context of the current American political debate.That is, this film gives face and voice to the disadvantaged, frustrated, have-not and ignored society that rose up and voted for Trump. The meticulously planned and executed robbery, which seems like their miraculous stroke of luck, stands in for their happy election result. But their relief is temporary, as the institutional threat at the end suggests. Their triumph is set to prove pyrrhic.Jimmy's decision to return the bulk of their unlawful score establishes this class as principled, wanting what's their due and to meet their need and no more. Nor for them the oily smugness of the racetrack management which is satisfied with the insurance payment they scored on drummed-up estimates. That victim proves more corrupt and greedy than the robbers. He evokes Trump's career of personally profitable bankruptcies. Our heroes have modest expectations of success. Mellie is a hairdresser. Jimmy's ex-wife moves interstate so hubby can set up a new car dealership. Her young daughter wins the talent pageant by dropping the Beyonce umbrella song she planned and rewarding her dad with his favourite song, that paean to West Virginia, ""(Take me home) Country Roads."" Her cracking little voice spurs the crowd to sing along. This is American community, cheesy but real. Our heroes' success requires the brothers to enlist another set of brothers, Joe Bang's. He also deploys another class of alienated and disadvantaged, the black convicts. Their riot succeeds because the vain warden (Dwight Yoakum) refuses to admit there can be a riot or a fire in his prison. The black force is abetted by the white vanity. The heist site is pure Americana — a speedway during a big Nascar race. There's the moving LeAnn Grimes anthem, unfurled field-sized flags, the showy jets above. And mainly, underneath the competition and working class ambitions and diversion a network of pipes channels all the incoming flood of money into a vault, which for once the have-nots — our gang — empties. That's a concise summary of America: a flashy patriotism covers the siphoning of all the poor folks' money to the rich. One can see how this script lured Soderburgh out of his retirement from filmmaking. The plot is a sharp piece of clockwork, including the device of breaking two convicts out of jail for the heist and returning them unnoticed after. The characters are colourful, touching, funny and engaging. The specifics of the heist with its protagonists' rise and fall are an irresistible analogue to Trump's failure to ""drain the swamp."" Left to themselves these characters manage to overcome the social and economic disadvantages laid on them. But in the end the system brings them down. In America the underclass cannot win, even when they briefly seem to. Crime doesn't pay — except for the bosses.This film's warmth and humanity demonstrate that the privileged elite (e.g., a mainstream film director) and the yappy liberals in his audience can after all acknowledge the needs of the disadvantaged, the ill-represented, can respect their difference and end up rooting for them. They're at least as American as the fat cats who exploit them. But as Trump reduces his presidency to self-dealing and self-service, these poor souls who invested their faith in him can't win. They're Logan lucky. Low men on the totem pole.",Logan Lucky

78,rockman182,Logan Lucky,8,21 August 2017,"Steven Soderbergh is responsible for many good things. Traffic, Oceans Eleven. Even his later efforts such as Side Effects and his foray into television with The Girlfriend Experience (and the film itself) are quite solid. I actually didn't keep up and realize he retired from film, only to return with Logan Lucky. I definitely was excited for this film though as it looked to be a comedic heist film along the lines of Ocean's Eleven, just with a southern twist. I have to say, Logan Lucky has exceeded my expectations and is a ton of fun from start to finish.The film is about Jimmy Logan who recently gets fired at his job and his plans to pull off a heist during the Coca-Cola 600 race. He recruits his one handed brother, his sister, bomb making expert from prison, and his two rather dim-witted brothers. As with Oceans Eleven the heist is slick and smart. There are comedic moments throughout which just makes the heist so much for fun. As with many of Soderbergh's previous efforts there are memorable characters littered throughout the film and nearly all of them are likable.I think the best of the bunch is Daniel Craig in the most bizarre role you will ever see him in. He's a cooky, quotable, yet very smart criminal who knows exactly what he is doing. Apparently the screenwriter for this film is a Rebecca Blunt, who no one in the cast has actually met. This leads me to think that Soderbergh is using a pseudonym and not for the first time in his career. No shame in hiding from a very well written film. There's probably holes and things that could have been written better near the end but it doesn't take away from the overall quality of the film.The film is quite self-aware. They have a knock on the film calling it the ""Oceans 7/11"". Everything link together and gels quite nicely as you would expect with a remarkable heist film. Soderbergh's cinematography is usually very good and as usual that's no different here. This ""Peter Andrews"" is very good at that, huh? I think above all the chemistry and comedic timing with the characters is what makes this film a very positive viewing experience. There's never a dull moment, and if there is a dull moment its through one of the characters literally having a dull moment where they forget something during the heist. Overall, its up there in Soderbergh's filmography and is likely the last good film of the summer.8/10",Logan Lucky

Since one of my favorite heist films, Ocean's Eleven (2001), was directed by Steven Soderbergh, I looked forward to his latest heist, Logan Lucky (2017). The trailers made it look like a fun film, and it was, but at the expense of all the best parts being conveyed in the trailer. About the only thing you don't see in the trailer is the twist at the end, which is to be expected.When it comes to the setting, I'm not entirely sure if Logan Lucky is embracing or parodying the hillbilly stereotype. From beauty pageants for children to NASCAR races, this film has all the trappings of a West Virginia based on cultural perception instead of actual reality. At any rate, there is a humor and charm in the drawling characters, which were played to significant effect by Channing Tatum, Adam Driver, and Daniel Craig (who was certainly cast off-type from his regular repertoire). The one character that seemed out of place was Seth MacFarlane's gum-chewing Max Chilblain, mostly because I couldn't place what accent he was trying to achieve. British? Australian? Some mix of the two?In the end, Logan Lucky delivers on its promise of a down-home country heist that's equal parts fun and smart. I know associating the hillbilly stereotype with smart seems odd, but Soderbergh manages to make it happen. Perhaps its strongest trait is the unexpected twist near the end of the film, as a series of flashbacks reveals the ""plan within the plan"" that helps to end the movie on a somewhat ambiguous note as the characters gather together in the bar run by Clyde Logan (Adam Driver).A fun heist film and return to form for Steven Soderbergh, I give Logan Lucky 3.5 stars out of 5.",Logan Lucky
80,RforFilm,"One joke refers to the caper as ""Oceans 7-11"". That about sums up Logan Lucky",7,20 August 2017,"Why do people like heist movies? Probably because they represent the anti-establishment and the boundaries that life sets. Though we have our fair share of stories about heroic cops that capture the villains, when we look at it from another perspective, the villain can often come out as the true hero. One often premise is that life has been unfair to someone and they want to balance out everything by taking what's theirs. Whether their right to do it is usually left to the viewers, but its common that part of the story has an officer looking for them.Today's movie is heist movie by Steven Soderbergh, who you may remember having directed the Ocean's 11 remake and their sequels. This also marks a theatrical return for the director since his Liberace movie, Behind the Candelabra. So we already know that not only can he deliver a good heist movie, but is likely to shoot it in more of an auteur fashion. The big difference here is that while the Ocean movies were about classy criminals stealing from a casino, the heroes here are robbing a Speedway during a NASCAR race. This is Logan Lucky. Jimmy Logan (played by Channing Tatum) was a once a potential football star whose career was cut short due to a leg injury. Now left with a permanent limp and lack of experience that makes finding work difficult, he's having a hard time paying for child support let alone support himself. He does have his brother Clyde (played by Adam Driver) for help. Though Clyde himself is an Iraq war veteran with a missing arm. After a fight with NASCAR driver Max Chilblain (played by Seth MacFarlane), Jimmy calls out ""cauliflower"", which is code for when he and his brother should commit a crime.As Jimmy's previous job as a construction worker game him working knowledge of the Charlotte Motor Speedway's cash flowing system, they both agree to rob the place. They end up hiring a safecracker whose serving time in jail Joe Bang (played by Daniel Craig). They develop a plan for Clyde to get himself incarcerated and for him and Joe to escape temporarily during the upcoming Coca Cola 600 race. Once a prison riot commences, the two make it out and everyone meets up underground to commence the robbery. For a simple story about not very bright robbers, this was a fun movie. Was it great? I wouldn't go that far, but it's entertaining and gave me my money's worth at the movies. It's clear that this film isn't trying to make a bold statement, but rather provide a simple caper (a lot like this years earlier Going in Style). I'll say upfront that I honestly haven't heard of a NASCAR heist story before. Not only how they do the heist is interesting, but you actually do become curious to see just how they orchestrate this. As I said, these are not smart crooks, but they do their best given their situation and the resources available. Most of the performances are good, like the ones from Channing Tatum and Adam Driver; their passable, but nothing new. My biggest surprise came from Daniel Craig, playing a rare American character. Maybe its because I'm so used to seeing him as James Bond, that almost anything besides that will catch my interest. Thankfully, it pays off, as he plays him in a more comedic fashion then I would have expected. Is there a comedic bug within Daniel Craig we don't know about?While the preparation and actual heist proved to be fun, it's the conclusion where things slow down and not in a good way. The last twenty minutes feels like that they go on for way too long. I tries to expand the story by adding an FBI investigation subplot that not only comes out of nowhere, but I added very little. Despite a committed Hillary Swank playing the role of a detective, they could have cut this out and it would have not changed the story much. It certainly doesn't ruin the rest of the movie, but it's like the editing added more padding for a longer runtime.I'll give this seven prosthetic arms out of ten. Lucky Logan is the kind of caper story that has a lot of creativity, but could have used more of it when it came to the ending. This is not much of an action movie, but rather a comedy. I think it's worth the watch at least once. On a rainy day, it would have to be a TV movie.",Logan Lucky
81,Quietb-1,Watchable caper.,7,4 October 2017,"Your not unlucky if you missed this in theaters, it will enjoy a popular run on home platforms.A excellent cast that you may not recognize give uniformly fine performances. It's fun to watch the preparations for the heist and how it comes together. It's one of those movies that fills in the blanks in flashbacks as not everything is shown when it happened. A good script and director keep the action moving. The end credits state nobody was actually robbed but you, so the less you pay to see this the better off you are. It's a pleasant enough caper movie. Catch it in the comfort of your home.",Logan Lucky
82,bankofmarquis,Fun heist/caper flick,8,26 August 2017,"One of the main reasons that I began writing movie reviews is to bring attention to good, entertaining flicks that might be flying under your radar.  Such is the case with Steven Soderbergh's latest heist flick LOGAN LUCKY.  This is an entertaining movie that moves quickly and has much more under the surface than you might first think.Strongly and ably directed by Soderbergh, LOGAN LUCKY tells the story of the ""cursed"" Logan family of West Virginia (Channing Tatum, Adam Driver and Riley Keough) who are facing tough times.  The solution to their problem?  Rob the vault at the Charlotte Motor Speedway.  They enlist the Bang brothers (Jack Quaid, Brian Gleeson and a surprisingly, effectively funny Daniel Craig).  One problem there, Craig's character is currently in jail.Can this group of seemingly dimwitted West Virginians pull off the caper?  That's the fun of this movie and it's territory that Soderbergh has covered before with the OCEAN'S 11 films (there is even a callback in this flick to those movies when someone calls the robbery OCEAN'S 7/11) and he covers this territory well.  The caper is clever, yet simple.  Soderbergh (or, rather, writer Rebecca Blunt - which is believed to be a pseudonym for someone else) does a clever job of having Tatum's character keep a list of 10 things to think about during a robbery and the script follows these rules, which makes things easy to follow.But, of course, in these types of films, it is the characters that make (or break) things and Soderbergh has assembled a a crew that is very enjoyable to watch starting with Channing Tatum  (MAGIC MIKE) as Jimmy Logan, a former high school and college football ""legend"" (at least in West Virginia) who is having trouble making ends meet as a result of a career ending knee injury.  Tatum does a nice job of showing us a thoughtful, rounded human being under the veneer of a West Virginia ""hick"".  He is joined by his one-armed brother, Adam Driver, (Kylo Ren in STAR WARS)  in another interesting and watchable performance and their sister, Mellie (Riley Keough, MAD MAX: FURY ROAD) a performer who I knew little about before this film, but is one that I will be keeping an eye on going forward.The film picks up energy with the introduction of the Bang brothers.  Dim-witted (and I do mean dim-witted) Fish and Sam Bang (an unrecognizable Jack Quaid and Brian Gleeson, son of Brendan) - who gave me 2 or 3 strong, burst out-loud laughs and their older brother, explosives expert Joe Bang.  This was the best, most surprising part - Joe Bang is played with a continual twinkle in his eye by James Bond himself, Daniel Craig.  You can see the danger in his eyes and movements but you can also detect a layer of intelligence in his portrayal, all the while keeping the ""wink"" in his eye that let's you know that he (and we) are having fun.  Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't mention Dwight Yoakim's turn as the head of the prison where Joe Bang is incarcerated.  I want to see a film of Yoakim running this prison.  There is so much story there to mine.The film isn't perfect - there is a subplot involving a NASCAR driver (Sebastian Stan - Bucky in the AVENGERS films) and his owner (a miscast Seth McFarlane) that goes nowhere and Katherine Waterston is wasted in the ""love interest for Tatum"" role, but all-in-all, I had a good time at this film and I think you will, too.It's the perfect film for a rainy Saturday afternoon, which is what most of Minnesota (and Texas!) will be having today.Letter Grade B+8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)hat to the Bank (ofMarquis)",Logan Lucky

84,dave-mcclain,"""Ocean's 11"" meets ""Talladega Nights""... but not as good as either.",5,22 August 2017,"It seems that everybody likes a good heist movie. This one has two guys who have a long history with each other (one of them dealing with a hostile ex-wife) who decide to rob a large entertainment venue during on especially busy day. They put together a motley crew to pull off their plan, which is very intricate, involving many moving pieces and requiring a few lucky breaks along the way. We don't see the extent to which everything came together until flashback scenes toward the end of the movie and, in the last scene, we're left with the impression that the story may not be as complete as we thought.Oh, but I wasn't just talking about the subject of this review, the comedy crime drama ""Logan Lucky"" (PG-13, 1:59). Everything I said in the previous paragraph also applies to the 2001 crime drama ""Ocean's 11"". It only makes sense. This movie's director, Steven Soderbergh, also directed the first three ""Ocean's"" movies (including the 2004 and 2007 sequels, but not counting the 2018 all-female ""Ocean's 8"" for which he's as producer). (However, he did not write any of these films – or his Oscar-winning effort, ""Traffic"", or ""Erin Brockovich"", ""Contagion"", ""Side Effects"" or ""Magic Mike"", all of which he also directed.) Soderbergh's 2017 heist movie has a lot in common with some of his previous work, but has a very different setting – the southern U.S. This is ""Ocean's 11"" meets ""Talladega Nights"". The Logans make up one of the most UN-lucky families in the South. At least, that's what Clyde Logan (Adam Driver) believes. He can rattle off a long list of relative misfortune to anyone who will listen, especially to his older brother, Jimmy (Channing Tatum). Jimmy had been a star high school quarterback and appeared destined to play college ball and then move on to the pros until a leg injury ended those dreams and left Jimmy with a permanent limp. Since then, he married a woman named Bobbie Jo (Katie Holmes), had a daughter named Sadie (Farrah Mackenzie) and got divorced. Since Bobbie Jo got full custody, Jimmy has to drive from Charlotte, North Carolina to West Virginia to visit his daughter (which he does frequently but not always reliably) and support her participation in beauty pageants.Complicating matters further, Jimmy just loses his job working construction in the tunnels underneath the Charlotte Motor Speedway (due to liability issues related to his bum leg). For his part, Clyde is a disabled military veteran who lost his left hand and forearm in Iraq. Clyde is now a sad sack bartender who never smiles, usually speaks in a monotone and is kinda slow. One day, British businessman and NASCAR team owner Max Chilblain (Seth MacFarlane) comes into Clyde's bar and begins mocking his disability. Jimmy defends his brother, gets into a fight and destroys Chillblain's car, and the incident gets on Jimmy's last nerve. He decides to stand up for the little guy – and take a bold step to change his life.Jimmy cooks up a scheme to rob the Charlotte Motor Speedway. Having worked that underground construction job, he knows how they move the money, where they store it and how to get to it. Clyde convinces Jimmy to join him, but they're gonna need more help. They visit an old acquaintance named Joe Bang (Daniel Craig) who is an explosives expert. One problem – Joe is ""in-car-cer-ated"" (as he sarcastically reminds the brothers) – and is up for parole soon. They say they can get him out of jail to do the job and get him back before he's missed. Joe decides to trust Jimmy and Clyde – but not completely.Joe insists that his brothers be a part of the heist. Jimmy and Clyde recruit Sam Bang (Brian Gleeson) and Fish Bang (Jack Quaid), even though the Bangs says they ""walk with God now"" and need ""a moral reason"" to do the job. The Logans invent one, add their younger sister, Mellie (Riley Keough), to the crew and Jimmy's plan takes shape. Along the way, Clyde gets himself thrown in jail (on purpose), the robbery has to be moved up a week (to Memorial Day Weekend!), and other problems arise, but Jimmy gets everything set and he makes a phone call, saying ""call the baker"", a signal which sets the plan in motion. After the job, Logan's Six must try to avoid suspicion from FBI agents (led by Hillary Swank).""Logan Lucky"" is a pleasant enough diversion, but not especially creative. Soderbergh himself calls it ""an anti-glam version of an Ocean's movie"", but he doesn't make especially good use of his setting. Although the locations, circumstances and people are indeed ""all South all the time"", the script isn't as funny as it tries to be and most of the cleverness comes from heist movie clichés. Country music fans will enjoy the soundtrack (with special attention paid to John Denver's ""Take Me Home, Country Roads""), but may wonder whether they're laughing at these unsophisticated characters – or with them. The bright spots come from a few very good moments and the performances against type by actors like Adam Driver and especially Daniel Craig. With all that and a moderate amount of southern charm, the movie is mildly entertaining, but whether you'll consider yourself ""lucky"" if you're fixin' to take a peek at this Logans' saga, I reckon is kinda iffy. ""B-""",Logan Lucky
85,joebloggscity,"It's not Ocean's 11, but a damn near close Deep South adaption",6,30 September 2017,"For this film, it's simply a case that you are going to hear enough references to Ocean's 11 when any reviews come up, and that is natural. The film even mentions it at one point to make it clear to avoid any counterclaims.We have a blue-collar family who decide to pull in a convict & his brothers to help complete the robbery of a lifetime at a local giant speedway circuit.The film is mostly for laughs, and thankfully without any glam. Sadly it does lapse into clichés on blue collar white folk which is unnecessary, but actually this film sympathises with them, and you begin to really empathise with the characters. Adam Driver as one of the lead two brothers is really excellent in his role, and is the one you root for most in his but Channing Tatum also plays his part well without resorting to anything typecast.Ably supported by a good cast, and a story line that doesn't need to go at breakneck speed with big scores or rock soundtracks, this is a fine eulogy to the south.I enjoyed it, the only problem is some of the lack of originality and the at times blue collar clichés which are cheap.

86,swilliky,Decent heist movie from Soderbergh,7,24 August 2017,"Steven Soderbergh returns to the heist film with a regional twist. Jimmy Logan (Channing Tatum) just wants to take care of his daughter Sadie (Farrah Mackenzie) and work but when he's fired from a construction job at the Charlotte Motor Speedway for insurance liability, he devises a plan to rob the racetrack. His sister Mellie Logan (Riley Keough) is a hairdresser who loves to drive fast and cover for her brother. Clyde Logan (Adam Driver) lost his arm in Iraq and works as a bartender. Jimmy is a tough former football player who had a promising career until he blew out his knee. He is defensive of his brother when a wealthy energy drink mogul Max Chilblain (Seth MacFarlane) insults Clyde. He also has a troubled relationship with his ex- wife Bobbie Jo (Katie Holmes). Clyde is reluctant to go along with Jimmy's plan at first but agrees to hear him out. Their initial plan was to rob the speedway during a smaller race and the only one who can help them is Joe Bang (Daniel Craig). The Logan brothers visit Joe with a plan to break him out to help and then get him back in but Bang insists that he has family help as well. The Logan brothers recruit Fish Bang (Jack Quaid) and Sam Bang (Brian Gleeson) who claim to have to have a moral reason for robbing the venue. They set out to make the plan but Jimmy discovers the construction will finish early so they have to move it up to the Coca-Cola 600, a much bigger NASCAR event. The plan to break out Joe Bang involves Clyde going into the prison so he crashes his car into a gas station. Bang organizes a prison riot to occur and pretends to be sick so he can be in the medical ward.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Logan Lucky

To pull this off he needs help from an explosives expert called Joe Bang played by Daniel Craig.You won't help thinking that this film is a very funny (tongue in cheek) version of 'Ocean's 11' The plot is totally chaotic and very funny for it, the robbery is very complex, and really depends on the audience missing some tiny details.

The movie starts with the main character working a construction job. He is then fired due to an injury and he begins creating the heist plan. He employs his one-armed brother, and a felon that specialized in explosives. The entire movie is centered around the heist's planning, execution, and aftermath.The acting from the entire cast is great. Even the child actors fit their roles well. The movie takes place in the American South and all of the cast members have a regional accent. This helped the audience actually believe in the setting and characters. Daniel Craig does an exceptional job with his character of Joe Bang. He has the mannerisms of a convict and he pulls it off with conviction.The directing in the movie is somewhat bland. Scenes did flow together well and each image captured its spirit correctly. In this type of movie, the somewhat bland direction still did not detract from the direction.The writing in this movie had a great feel. The movie felt like it took place in the South. Mannerisms and even accents felt localized. The characters were well-written. None of the movie felt out-of-place.

Expertly written, with rich characters and many laugh-out-loud moments. Daniel Craig's best role yet. Adam Driver had me laughing even more than his ""I just had sex and I'm about to each NACHOS!"" role in 'What If'.Channing Tatum is surprisingly well-suited at channeling a redneck hillbilly - perhaps his Alabama background helped provide extra authenticity.

93,MrDHWong,"Another enjoyable heist from the acclaimed director, but does fall a bit short of being as just as fun",7,29 November 2017,"Logan Lucky is a heist film starring Channing Tatum and Adam Driver. Directed by Steven Soderbergh (Ocean's Trilogy, Traffic, Erin Brockovich), the film is another enjoyable heist from the acclaimed director, but does fall a bit short of being as just as fun.In North Carolina, brothers Jimmy (Channing Tatum) and Clyde Logan (Adam Driver) have constantly dealt with bad luck throughout their lives, with Jimmy losing out on a football career due to an injury and Clyde losing most of his left arm while serving in Iraq. Attempting to end their financial troubles and break the ""Logan curse"" once and for all, the brothers conspire to pull off a heist at a NASCAR race, exploiting Jimmy's knowledge of the tunnels underneath the speedway.Featuring a solid cast and an interesting conclusion, Logan Lucky is an amusing heist film which plays out more as a rawer, stripped-down version of the Ocean's Trilogy, which was also directed by Soderbergh. The unusual setting of a car race makes for a major departure from a typical heist movie and the pacing feels somewhat slower than what would normally be expected. The humour is dry and simple enough for even the most casual film-goer to understand, again a major deviation from the wittier and cleverer comedy of the ""Ocean's"" films. Channing Tatum and Adam Driver have surprisingly strong chemistry with each other and are quite convincing as two, down-on-their-luck brothers, however it is Daniel Craig as their recruited safebreaker who stands out the most due to his eccentric personality.I rate it 7/10",Logan Lucky

However it wasnt anything too original. We have seen that story before, we have seen those characters before and I fast lost interest in them, except for the one played by Daniel Craig. That was a brilliant character and the performance by Craig is among his very best. 
The acting of the rest of the cast was fine too. Channing Tatum was hilarious and better than Adam Driver, what surprised me. Driver was also giving a fine performance. I enjoyed the small role by Hilary Swank who should do more films like that. Riley Keough was also fun and personalized that white trash quite well. 
I loved the soundtrack and the editing and whole look and feel of the movie remindsd me on on Steven Soderbergh's ""Ocean"" days.
All in all a cool little movie, that tries to be too cool for its own good at times. It felt a bit forced but other than that, entertaining of course.",Logan Lucky
95,CANpatbuck3664,Logan Lucky Crosses the Finish Line Thanks to Its Light-Hearted Tone and a Cast That's Fully Invested,8,23 August 2017,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Logan Lucky centres on the Logan family. Jimmy (Channing Tatum), Clyde (Adam Driver) and Mellie (Riley Keough)) work blue collar jobs and try to get by. Jimmy is having a tough time right now, he's been laid off from his construction job and he's having trouble figuring out the custody of his daughter Sadie (Farrah Mackenzie). He wasn't well off before and now that he's lost his job, he's approaching desperate. He enlists his brother and sister to help him rob the Charlotte Motor Speedway vault, where he was working filling sinkholes before he was let go. But they'll need a little extra help so they go see Joe Bang (Daniel Craig) who is going to need to be freed from jail if he's going to be part of the crew.Steven Soderbergh carries a certain standard. When you go to watch one of his movies, you expect a quality product. He's a well-rounded and experienced director but he's also comfortable working within the heist/comedy genre. He directed the Ocean's 11 trilogy to mixed success (I really liked 11 and 13, 12 not so much). Where those movies focused on the glamorous and theatrical side of robbing a casino, this movie has a completely different vibe. Logan Lucky is primarily set in West Virginia and North Carolina and instead of trying to ignore the attitude and style of those locations, they play it up in a strangely respectful way. Most of the characters in this movie aren't just rednecks, they're hardcore rednecks. Add in rusty pickup trucks, child beauty pageants, John Denver songs, county fairs where they play horseshoes with toilet seats etc. Yet the movie doesn't laugh at it, they seem to celebrate it. I laughed at these things but it was in the spirit of fun and I appreciated that instead of being cruel, the movie walked the line of being funny and yet giving these people their due.The central hurdle of any heist movie is that they're always going to stretch the truth to add the required thrills. Is it to the point where you can still buy into the plot? Even though a lot of the characters are as dumb as a bag of rocks, I was still able to go along with this movie. Are certain points unrealistic? Definitely. Do they always do an effective job explaining it? No, the movie is deliberately opaque even for this genre. But it never got to the point that I was angry with it or ready to check out. So while I can't promise complete realism, as long as you're willing to go along with this, I don't think you'll have a problem with the logical leaps.Logan Lucky attracted the big name talent you would expect in a Soderbergh project and I think he got some really great performances out of them. Channing Tatum has transformed into a decent leading man. He's funny in the right places, dramatic in the others. He's consistent with his accent and he's does a solid job. Adam Driver is also good as his brother Clyde but his accent was touch too slow. Riley Keough gives an underrated performance but she's not given as much to do as the trailer would lead you to believe. There's a lot of superb acting from supporting performances: Farrah Mackenzie, Katie Holmes, Jack Quaid and Brian Gleeson. I didn't like Hilary Swank as much and although he was decent, Seth MacFarlane pushes the chewing the scenery boundaries. The guy who steals the show is Daniel Craig as Joe Bang. He looks like he's overjoyed to be doing this and although he's hamming it up, he's awesome in Logan Lucky. I think his performance will be one of the more memorable aspects of Logan Lucky.My biggest problem with Logan Lucky is that the movie gets bogged down with meaningless subplots and it introduces characters that have little to nothing to do with the plot. Sebastian Stan's character of Dayton White has almost nothing to do with the central plot and I kept waiting for his subplot to pay off and it just never came. It was the same thing with Katherine Waterson's character Sylvia Harrison. Its nice that they setup a potential love interest for Jimmy but when you consider their scene together, it has no impact and I don't understand why Stan and Waterson were featured in the marketing for this. The movie didn't drag for me but coming out of the theatre with the friend I saw this with, we were adding things up and realizing how much they could have cut out of this.After stepping out of the theatre and discussing things with my friend, it crossed my mind that I could really pick this movie apart if I wanted. But the bottom line is that I had a big grin on my face for the entirety of the movie. This movie was a lot of fun and while that seems like a simplistic description, that's honestly how I felt. The movie was well-shot, funny and it rarely missteps. At worst, the movie doesn't know when things need be streamlined a little more. If you're looking for a fun and offbeat heist movie, give this a chance.",Logan Lucky

You could argue that there's nothing truly original here, but doing a different kind of heist movie - one that introduces unconventional characters and genuinely keeps you guessing - is a feat in and of itself.

102,PyroSikTh,"Dull Introductions, Hilarious and Entertaining Heist, Overlong Final Act",6,30 August 2017,"The Logan brothers, looking to break the 'Logan Curse' and turn their lives around, decide to rob a vault beneath the local NASCAR track. They're just normal country people struggling every day, so they're punching a little above their weight. They decide to enlist the help of local legend Joe Bang to help them blow open the vault, and he requires the involvement of his two half-wit brothers. Of course, much like the Oceans movies, we the audience are barely let in on the plan until it happens, and even then we're still not privy to all its finer details, lending to a plot structure of twists and turns.Logan Lucky is a movie rife with story problems though, unfortunately. The biggest being the pacing. The opening and closing acts are far too long and simply not interesting enough. A huge slab of time is spent establishing characters and setting up the great heist, which is great and lends to some great moments of comedy. However I just felt it could've been trimmed down a bit. The final act also falls flat by being way too long. The heist is over, but we get a whole half an hour to close the film out. There's post-heist revelations to be had, which is fine, but it takes too long to get there, opening the way for boredom and disinterest to start setting in.Another big problem with these two acts of the film are the completely pointless characters. Katherine Waterston's mobile nurse serves no purpose at all. I'm struggling to think why she's there at all. She has no part of the heist, or even any knowledge of it. Her relationship to Jimmy Logan is never explored and, until the final scenes, is left as a chance, inconsequential encounter that apparently meant more than it actually did. Hilary Swank's Special Agent Grayson isn't even introduced until the final act when the heist is already over. She pontificates over the crime scenes, gets disgruntled at NASCAR management, and then randomly appears with everyone else. She at least serves more purpose than Waterston's Sylvia, but I don't feel the film would've suffered at all from cutting her completely, and doing so would have in fact tightened up that last act a hell of a lot.Other characters that suffer from pointlessness include Seth MacFarlane's alcohol peddler. He poses as the one unforeseen risk to the Logan's plan, and is the only viable reason for Swank's Agent to appear in the bar, but in all he could've been cut and the film lost nothing but a bad British accent. Sebastian Stan's NASCAR driver also didn't serve much point other than as yet another sounding board for Chilblain's arrogance and painting his character as even more unlikeable.All that said, the film was a winner in every aspect. The actual heist itself is full of entertaining moments. The plan is pretty ingenious, and just waiting for the Logan Curse to kick in is a recipe for some edge-of-your-seat moments. The fact it spans several different locations all serving different purposes keeps it from turning stale as well, such as the prison riot covering for Joe's disappearance, or the effect the unknown heist has on the staff and security on the track above.The comedy is pretty great as well. This certainly isn't a laugh-out-loud film, full of jokes at every turn, but it definitely prefers a more lighthearted tone with some choice moments sprinkled throughout. An argument over George R.R. Martin's writing pace with the Song of Ice and Fire books is a particular highlight, as are the Bang brothers' dim-witted shenanigans; ""I know all the Twitters.""Daniel Craig is also pretty hilarious in a role completely different to anything I've seen of him before. Bleached blonde, and with a heavy southern drawl, he's a scene-stealer and responsible for some of the film's best and most entertaining moments. Channing Tatum is also great as Jimmy Logan, the deceptively smart orchestrator of the whole heist who just wants to provide for his family the best he can. Adam Driver sparks a subtle line of comedy through seriousness as the one- armed Clyde Logan, often proving an equal to Craig's Joe, and Riley Keough's Mellie Logan is more than just a pretty face.Ultimately though, Logan Lucky is one of the most American films I've seen in a long time, pitching rural hicks against one of the most stereotypically American sporting events, and acting as the ultimate fantasy of the American dream. The soundtrack is full of country music from the likes of John Denver to Creedence Clearwater. There's even LeAnn Rimes singing 'America the Beautiful'. And yet Logan Lucky feels more like a love-letter to rural America than a parody of it, it's more a glimpse at redneck sensibilities than a patriotic celebration.Final verdict on Logan Lucky? Hit and miss. It has some great moments thanks to Daniel Craig and Rebecca Blunt's script. The heist is hugely entertaining to watch unfold, the Logans are charming likable characters to root for, and the comedy is just enough to give you a hearty chuckle every now and then without running the film into a full-on parody. However it's also a movie full of so much faff that needs wading through to get to the meaty bits. The opening and closing acts drag on way too long exploring unnecessary details, and Wasterston and Swank - and to an extent MacFarlane and Stan - feel like they were only included to get their names on the poster. Oh and Katie Holmes was unsurprisingly awful. I enjoyed myself for the most part, but I doubt it's a film I'll watch again. I give it a satisfactory 6/10.",Logan Lucky
103,CinematicInceptions,Okay revival of the crime comedy genre.,8,28 January 2018,"It saddens me that crime comedies are quickly becoming a thing of the past. I think it's a fabulously entertaining genre that, while the movies that make it up often become rather formulaic, are still a lot of fun to watch over and over. While Logan Lucky is hardly the best of the bunch, it manages to be somewhat original and fun while conforming to the tropes of its genre. Where Soderburg used grand scale and cool characters to make Ocean's Eleven a great movie, he here employs the inverse by winning the audience over with more down-to-earth characters and fairly mundane methods for executing the heist. His cast is similarly star-studded, but the actors are all cast in roles that are rather uncommon for them. That said, I wouldn't have cast it differently, except for maybe Hillary Swank. All of the actors proved that they have more versatility than audiences might think. None of the comedy was gut-wrenchingly funny, but it was original and specific enough to be enjoyable. The Game of Thrones thing in the prison was really funny. Having Daniel Craig play such a unrefined character after getting used to him as James was also fun. Again, it wasn't one of the funnier comedies I've seen but it was amusing throughout.The movie is well out of theaters by now, but if you missed it, I would recommend renting it. It won't be your favorite Soderberg, but it's a good classic crime comedy. Yes, there are some boring parts to it and a few things that are a little cheesy and basic, but on the whole I enjoyed it.

I didn't have any sympathy for any of the characters, there were a couple of lame attempts to pull at the heartstrings that seemed out of place, and the execution of the theft required so much coordination it was ridiculous. And what the heck was with the Hilary Swank character?

Definitely Cohen Brothers-esque in scene structure, it approaches its surrealist scenes with a little too much self-consciousness. You can hear Soderbergh standing behind the camera saying: ""this is just CRA-Z, huh?"" None of the cool casting quite pans out. Channing Tatum just isn't very interesting when wearing realistically ill-fitting clothing. Hilary Swank seems to take her part with as little seriousness as she used when filming ""The Core"". Why was Seth MacFarland's character British? This is an auto racing movie set in West Virgina, an Englishman would have been run out of the state the moment they got a whiff of his accent.

109,stevenrotherforth,Not really the movie the trailers suggest but an entertaining one nonetheless,7,25 January 2018,"Logan LuckyIf you're settling down to watch this film expecting a remake of the recent Wolverine movie (Logan) but with a much happier ending than you're going to be disappointed.
Also if like me you watched the trailers and was led to believe that Logan Lucky is a laugh a minute comedy starring a bleached haired Bond you're also going to be a little disheartened.
Whilst Daniel Craig does feature with a hairstyle making him look like Tin Tins dad this movie is nothing like the movie marketing would have you believe.Logan Lucky stars Channing Tatum and Adam Driver as two hapless brothers who decide to rob the venue of a NASCAR race in North Carolina.
To do this they require the assistance of explosives expert Joe Bang played by the aforementioned Daniel Craig who gives a performance like you've never seen him before.
Craig's character is serving time for crimes committed and needs to be sprung from prison before he can lend the Logan brothers a helping hand.
As I mentioned earlier this movie isn't a full blown comedy as the trailers suggest. However there is a good dose of humour sprinkled subtly throughout. Just enough to elevate proceedings and refrain this movie from becoming a slow paced heist movie that doesn't offer anything new.
In fact it is the performances and superb comedic timing of both Craig and Driver that carry this movie.
As I said, the comedy is subtly delivered but performances by all are engaging.
There's a wonderful cameo from the fantastic Seth Macfarlane who is so good he can morph into the most ludicrous of creations.
Sebastian Stan is also a welcome treat as is a appearance from Hilary Swank.
Nice to see her again.
I was beginning to think she had fallen off the face of the planet.Logan Lucky is a good looking movie too. Picture quality is sharp with no Arty Farty grainy camera shots that are often used by acclaimed directors.
Colours are vivid but never over powering making this movie a striking visual feast when viewed in 4K or 1080p.
Sound is also mighty impressive.
There's no Jurassic Park like room shaking sound but musical soundtracks are handled nicely taking advantage of a good 5.1 set up.
Rear speakers direct individual musical instruments straight to the ear and the bass is also punchy.Speaking of such acclaimed directors, Steven Soderbergh helms a tight ship but this movie isn't the masterpiece some critics would have you believe.
Yes it is thoroughly entertaining but it's nothing new.
It is as perhaps the DVD TV ad campaign suggests.

112,EthanBJones_03,Don't Recommend,5,8 October 2017,"'LOGAN LUCKY' - 2017Directed by Steven SoderberghStarring Channing Tatum, Adam Driver and Daniel Craig​ Plot Overview: After he gets fired from a job, Jimmy Logan(Channing Tatum) hatches a plan with his brother, Clyde Logan(Adam Driver) and demolitions expert Joey Bang(Daniel Craig) to rob the Charlotte Motor Speedway. But as the 'Logan Family Curse' looms over him and his brother, naturally things don't go as smoothly as they could have.Steven Soderbergh is a director who hasn't achieved much mainstream success. His work is typically very artsy and are 'films' rather than 'movies#'. Perhaps the closest he's achieved to mainstream success in with his Ocean's Trilogy. And they were exceptionally fun and entertaining movies. From the trailer, I was wrongfully led to believe this would be in the vain of the Ocean's Trilogy, a fun, quirky, perhaps less glamorous, heist movie. But this was a wrongful accusation. I will explain why further on but I think it's fair to appreciate some of the film's strengths.Firstly, the cinematography. Soderbergh movies always look fantastic and are visual treats. The editing in this movie is pretty much flawless and every camera angle feels important. This is perhaps the film's greatest strength but that seems redundant considering it is likely trying to appeal to mass audiences. Obviously, critics and film enthusiasts and sad, lonely people who analyse every shot of a movie for hidden meanings will adore that in this movie*. And I fall into the second of the three categories. I do admire the cinematography and editing BUT it wasn't what I went into this movie expecting. I expected escapism but instead got a homework assignment.Easily the second greatest strength of the movie is Daniel Craig. The man is an acting machine and he succeeds in delivering an incredible performance in this movie. He steals every single scene he is in and is an all around pleasure to watch. Channing Tatum and Adam Driver, while good in the movie, are only really the supporting cast to Craig. This is his movie and without him it would fall flat on its face. He's the only remotely interesting or semi-likable character, and without him - the movie fails spectacularly. My biggest flaw with this movie is how much I was mislead. All I wanted was a couple hours escapism in a fun, goofy heist movie in the vain of the Ocean's Trilogy with an ensemble cast I really enjoy. But I didn't get that. It isn't the laugh-out-loud comedy the trailers led me to believe but instead a rather dull and monotonous series of unfortunate events that miraculously lead to a dull and monotonous conclusion. I think every film fan will agree that part of the fun of seeing a heist movie is seeing how they pulled it off. That is what I look forward to in a heist movie: the conclusion. But the conclusion in this movie is so lacklustre and the grand reveal so contrived and forced that I just did not care in the slightest for it.If you want a fun movie, don't watch this boring yet artistic waste of time. If you want to analyse a movie, frame by frame, then please feel free to do so and enjoy this movie for what it is: a technical piece of art. But those in the latter of the two camps will most likely be the only people who enjoy this movie. The trailers are misleading, the characters are mostly subpar and the grand reveal is ultimately disappointing. I don't recommend this movie overall and I'll rate it an extremely disappointing 5 'Family Curses' out of 10.* If you do fall into this category, it was a joke. Don't get angry at me.",Logan Lucky

114,dr_clarke_2,"As Soderbergh himself has noted, an anti-glam riposte to Ocean's Eleven and its sequels",8,28 June 2021,"Mention Steven Soderbergh and the phrase ""heist movie"" in the same breath and most people will immediately think of the Ocean's trilogy. But his 2017 film Logan Lucky is another example of the genre, and one that provides a tongue-in-cheek counterpoint to his earlier three films, entirely lacking the glitz and glamour of those movies.Based on a screenplay by the enigmatic and possibly fictitious Rebecca Blunt, Logan Lucky is - as Soderbergh himself has noted - an anti-glam riposte to Ocean's Eleven and its sequels, replacing the high-tech, cool protagonists lead by Danny Ocean with a gang of down-on-their-luck rednecks led by Jimmy Logan and his very odd one-armed war veteran brother Clyde. They aren't planning to rob a bank, but a NASCAR speedway and at one point, the robbery is referred to in a news report as ""the Hillbilly heist"" and - in case anyone has missed the comparison - ""Ocean's 7-11"".What the film does have in common with the Ocean's films however is an elaborately complicated plan with a twist revealed by a crucial flashback towards the end that reveals hitherto unknown information (a Soderbergh trait), as well as a witty script, a whole host of colourful characters, and a great cast. Channing Tatum is enormously likable as Jimmy, whilst the versatile Adam Driver is astonishing as the slightly unhinged Clyde. Daniel Craig is successfully cast against type and mumbles his way through the almost-impenetrable dialogue of safe-cracker Joe Bang, whilst Brian Gleeson and Jack Quaid adopt hick accents as Joe's halfwit (but very moral) brothers Sam and Fish. Hilary Swank turns up in the second half of the film as the amusingly menacing FBI Agent Sarah Grayson, whilst Seth MacFarlane entertainingly hams it up as the ludicrously named Max Chilblain. These characters are broadly drawn, and therein lies much of the humour, which is often very, very funny.Stylistically, the film is unmistakeable Soderbergh's, not just in the direction and dynamic cinematography (credited to his pseudonym Peter Andrews), but in the attention to detail. There's an admirable amount of ""show, don't tell"" to the plotting, which is realised thanks to Soderbergh's skill, whilst his fondness for close-ups serves the story well, highlighting details such as the cockroaches being deployed. There are lots of nice touches, including the debate between the prison inmates and the warden about George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire novels and the presence of four Fox NASCAR commentators appear as themselves.Soderbergh's regular collaborator David Holmes provides the soundtrack, which has appropriate country and western overtones and appropriately, country musician Dwight Yoakam plays Warden Burns, and he comes as close as is possible to stealing the show as any single member of the impressive cast could. Like Ocean's Eleven, the film ends with a knowing sting in the tale as Sarah Grayson arrives at Clyde's bar to join in a toast. There's no sign of a sequel on the horizon, so this is unlikely to become the first of the Logan's trilogy, but it's so relentlessly entertaining and the characters so likeable that I for one would welcome more.",Logan Lucky
115,DeBBss,The Redneck Version of Ocean's Eleven...,7,3 December 2017,"When I saw the trailer for Logan Lucky, I was sure it was going to be the redneck version of Ocean's Eleven, because of the similar style and the same director. Although Logan Lucky does have a few good moments, it falls flat on the comedy part. If Logan Lucky had a better writer, or the same writers from Ocean's Eleven, then Logan Lucky could have been a hit.Story: 6/10The motives for Logan Lucky are very unclear. I understand That Jimmy Logan (Channing Tatum) is broke, he has no job, and he lives with his brother, Clyde Logan (Adam Driver). Yes, I understand that all those reasons justify why he plotted to do a heist, but if they made a more emotional or even a funny reason why he plotted this all, it would make a better story. So Jimmy Logan plans to do a heist at a NASCAR event with his brother and a different family of brothers, (their all rednecks). I love seeing these ridiculous people perform a heist, and get away with it, these characters have such charm that make it hard not to like them. The story is decent, the pacing is a bit off, and the motives are boring.Characters: 8/10Jimmy Logan: So Jimmy Logan is the smartest out of the team, he basically plotted all of it. Jimmy Logan is the most boring character unfortunately. Because he's the smartest, it makes him the more boring, if they all made them clueless and clumsy, I think it would make Logan Lucky a better movie overall.Clyde Logan: Clyde Logan is the most average character in the movie, there is nothing special about him, except he has no forearm. Clyde Logan does have this charm that makes him a likable character.Joe Bang: Joe Bang is by far my favorite character. Daniel Craig did such a great job on this character. Joe Bang has this ridiculous, but smart personality. Joe Bang is so unique and entertaining, and because of that, he has a lot of rememberable quotes.Comedy: 5/10The comedy is by far the weakest part about Logan Lucky. I really wanted Logan Lucky to be a hilarious movie, but it really falls flat. There was some good parts, but some times the joke doesn't work, and it gets awkward. The idea of a bunch of idiots performing a difficult heist sounds like comedy gold, but it failed. Fortunately the charm of the characters saves this movie.Logan Lucky sounds great on paper, but obviously it didn't work as well as it sounds. If the comedy was good, then Logan Lucky could have done well in the box office. Overall, Logan Lucky has a lot of charm, good characters, but really weak comedy.",Logan Lucky

It's a refreshing structure, but there are too many ""set up"" scenes that don't get properly explained until way later into the heist and ultimately drag the pacing down. The first half also takes a long time to introduce each character but never gets us emotionally involved.Nothing groundbreaking, yet an enjoyable film with no highs and no lows.I definitely enjoy this kind of mainstream films from Soderbergh rather than farthouse pretentious stuff like ""Unsane"".",Logan Lucky

This is his first attempt to cut studios out entirely and get by on own means. The man's had enough of Ocean's"" after completing the trilogy but he likes an idea of a heist story. Logan Lucky"" is a working class version of this, which means less glamor and more people wearing blue jeans and eating at diners.

I still think it could've been shorter than 119 minutes, especially because some important plot parts are explained quickly rather than shown anyway. Also, there's no big amount of suspense or character development to justify this kind of duration. But maybe it's just me, dreaming of a perfect world where so many movies don't have to last two hours, so I have more time for other stuff too! PS The ony screen writing credit goes to Rebecca Blunt who is suspected to be a pseudonym. Would be nice to know who's behind it. Maybe it's like Roderick Jaynes for Coen movies. It wouldn't be the only nod to Coens in Logan Lucky"".",Logan Lucky
121,patriciogl10,Another surprisingly great heist movie.,8,31 August 2018,"I had my doubts about this movie, just seemed like another heist movie that tries to be clever, and that's exactly where most movies of this kind fail considerably. Coming from the mastermind that brought one of the best heist flicks ever, Steven Soderbergh, I should've put those doubts aside and prepare for the fun ride that Logan Lucky is. So we have these two brothers, one Jimmy Logan (Channing Tatum) recently fired and another, Clyde Logan (Adam Driver), a one-armed bartender who team up to pull off an elaborate plan that Jimmy apparently has been scheming for some time. It involves the Charlotte Motor Speedway, underground tubes and a vault filled with cash; the scenario: a NASCAR race, more specifically, the Coca Cola 600. But they need assistance to do so, so they recruit an experienced guy in explosives, Joe Bang (a hilarious Daniel Craig) along with his two brothers who will cover other endeavours; and also helping is the Logans' sister, Mellie (Riley Keough) who is a fast getaway driver. There are a few problems to begin with, one being that Joe Bang is in prison, so there's another plan to get him out of there only to perform the heist and then return him back to prison without anyone noticing his absence. Quite a challenge. So I'll leave the specifics of both plans to your viewing experience, since it's one of the highlights of the film.At the beginning of the movie, Clyde Logan rambles on about a supposed curse that haunts the Logan family, in which something bad always happens just when things are going great. Of course many things don't go out as planned so with a bit of quick thinking and luck the plan stays on track. From the start of the film up to the point when the robbery is concluded, there's a sense of conclusion running around that make it seem like the movie will be over soon, however the movie does not end, it just it carries us through the aftermath of the events, a small yet ingenious twist and an open ending.There are good supporting performances by Seth McFarlane, Sebastian Stan, Katie Holmes and a late introduction of Hilary Swank, who plays one of the FBI agents in charge of the investigation. Sincerely, I feel her character does not add much to the plot unless there are plans for a sequel in which she could take a much more important role.Overall, I think that Logan Lucky is a pleasant ride but it wouldn't have been harmed if it was a bit shorter. At the beginning I mentioned that most movies about heists try to be clever without actually being clever and ending up being unbelievable and unplausible. Well, Logan Lucky succeeds at being ingenious in my opinion, the main actors give firm performances but the stand-out in that department is Daniel Craig without a doubt.Watch it, take it for a ride, don't judge it beforehand like I did. This could surprise you.",Logan Lucky
122,austin0731,Ocean's Seven Eleven,6,5 September 2017,"The Ocean's Seven eleven. Perfect concludes this movie in an attempt to convey a comedic story of a couple of Southern redneck brothers and a 'grand heist'. This film takes on many comedic tropes and stereotypical characters mixed with awkward comedy completed with slightly over the top performances. This is a fun, light hearted film, with not much depth but an interesting premiss and relatively engaging hook and tension. Adam Driver as a one armed bartender and Daniel Craig as a Southern expert of explosives are just some of the funniest character tropes in this movie. Indeed, Logan Lucky puts all these top actors as West Virginians making it very amusing and fresh for audiences. Even though the absurdist humour incorporated is funny and well worth the laugh the slightly extended run time can lead to it being slightly dry at times, a major flaw of Logan Lucky. But, overall great laughs and a good time with an intriguing heist story.",Logan Lucky
123,carlos37andre,Better than Ocean's Eleven,7,27 November 2017,"At this moment, I saw just 2/3 of the ""Ocean's Eleven"" trilogy, and, well, I got it, that Steven Soderbergh has a crush in robbery movies.Just for the record, I think that ""Ocean's Eleven"" is ""ok"", and ""Ocean's Twelve"" is awful, with a lot of plot holes and etc. But, we are here to talk about Logan Lucky, and, well, it's a improve (in my opinion) on the directors career.I will star with my issues, and after I will talk about the things that I really like. The movie has some character motivations that are really forced, just to make the history going. Like when Clyde (Adam Drive) accepts participate to the assault, after he complains about past events. And, maybe the bigger issue with the movie, that you might say that I'm being too tough about it, but I had to say, is the ""plot hole"", when you never get an explanation on how Jimmy and Clyde are so good in this robbery thing, the only thing similar to that is when Clyde remember some past event, apparently the last time that Jimmy said ""cauliflower"", but, he says that he had THIRTEEN YEARS! This is definitely not an explanation for them to be ""robbery experts"". Even Ocean's Eleven had I really good and fast explanation for this, they were simply ""the world greatest robbers"". And that works.I almost forgot, but, we had to talk about it too: WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT FAKE ARM THAT ADAM DRIVER USED?! OMG! It was SO BIG!Well, besides that, I really like the movie, the actors are great! (In fact, this was my main reason to see this movie, and, god I had no regret at all) Adam Driver is very good, even though he doesn't have many lines. Tatum is really good, as always. And, of COURSE! Daniel Craig is fantastic, he probably will steal the movie for the majority of the audience. Even the little girl (Farrah Mackenzie) is really really good too, I was truly impressed with her every time she showed up on the screen. Soderbergh also improves himself a lot in the camera work, when you compare this movie to the Oceans Eleven trilogy, back then (especially in the second movie) he made some odd camera choices, with some really bad shoots, and a weird collor palette. But here, he make some really great shoots, I love the movie photography, with some scene where the camera stays put, and the character walks through her. Oh, and the soundtrack is FANTASTIC! Really really good, each song seens like it was made especially for that specific scene. In short, Logan Lucky is a good film, with a great cast, and good photography. Yes, it had some bad things to talk about, but the good things stand out for the majority of it.",Logan Lucky
124,drunken_munki,Entertaining heist film,6,14 November 2020,"Right away I like the casting in this. The characters are excellently written. I love the setting and the themes in this movie.It plays like a lighthearted version of 'Oceans 11', with some funny parts and some parts not hitting the notes quite right.In any case, the Nascar set is awesome for a heist movie, and the movie has good pacing and music that kicks it forward.6/10 an enjoyable heist movie with some humor.",Logan Lucky
125,Lewis_Heather787,A heist with a bunch of clowns !,7,30 August 2017,"Steven Soderbergh is one of the biggest names in directing and it was a shock when he decided to ""retire"" from film making, however this ""retirement"" didn't last very long. Thankfully he is back with a film that takes inspiration from his previous work on the Oceans films but with a unique and extremely effective twist. The directing in this film is brilliant did anyone expect anything else, the man is a genius. All the shots in the film are elegantly placed and framed, it is a beautiful film to watch coupled together with the great editing and cinematography. Soderbergh is back doing what he does best and it is great to see him back in the directing chair on a feature film. All the acting is this film is impeccable, there is not one person who puts a foot wrong every single one of them is at the top of there game. Channing Tatum and Adam driver have extremely good chemistry throughout the film and you can really buy into there relationship, also hats of the them with the accent neither miss a beat in the film with it. Riley Keough an actress I had not heard of until now was also very good in the film along side all the ""big names"", she is the hidden gem of the film. Then there is Daniel Craig who's is in a role you really would not expect him to take or do but he is hilarious in the film as Joe Bang, him along with his stupid brothers are brilliant in the film. Even though he is a criminal in the film you actually start rooting for him to succeed with the others and brake back into the prison. These are the standouts in the film but all the supporting acts such as Katie Holmes to Sebastian Stan are all really good as well, as a whole the cast is very impressive in this film and are very funny.The story of the film is actually really complex and is added upon due to the characters acting out in the world created by Soderbergh. The plan of the vault heist is actually quite complex itself once its explained fully at the end of them film, it is elevated more by the people who are carrying out the heist. Even though this is going to sound bad, the fact that the plan was created and carried out by ""dumb"" people makes it more impressive. I don't know why i think that its just the feeling I got when watching the film. The complexity of the film is not just for the sake of it as well, some films try far to hard to make the plan or the story/journey of the characters so complex and rich that it gets confusing. However Soderbergh is a master when it comes to this, it is a perfect fit its as if he is not even trying. There are a couple of negatives of the film, the first being Soderbergh himself, this film seems to much of a safe bet for the return of the man to directing. This is a film that sort of feels like Soderbergh warming up to directing again and is a practise run before he produces something amazing, I feel as if didn't push the boat out that much which is a little disappointing. The other negative of the film is the length of the film, it is quite long. I felt as if there where many times were the film could have ended nicely but decided to carry on and definitely towards the end does start to drag.All in all this film is really well made, directed, hilariously written and is a fun time to watch. It gets 75% of out 100 I feel this film is far to much of a safe bet for Soderbergh and that he didn't push the boat out. Apart from that minor fault of mine personally this film is really enjoyable to watch with some great characters and stupidly funny situations and dialogue, this deserves to get good box office numbers, don't be another ""The Nice Guys"" a small original film that bombs at the box office. Go and see it!",Logan Lucky
126,cordenw,Pretty enjoyable movie,8,9 September 2017,"Any time you've got that southern twang in a movie, you done bin an gort me. Daniel Craig , who was born just up the road from me in Merseyside and should have a Beatles accent, is very believable as a drawling, expert safe buster and stays well inside overdoing it with great talent ( it's easy to see why he was chosen for Bond!) Channing Tatum is very Ben Affleck-like in this performance and carries the role off convincingly, as do all of the cast.I still find it hard to believe that this is the same fantastic dancer from 'Hail Caesar' The girls in the movie are just perfect foils, Riley Keogh and Katie Holmes slot into the parts brilliantly with subtle shrugs and smiles that go for miles. As some of the critics have said, it's a bit of a complex set up but the director does a great job of taking time to fill us in on what's happening in case you lose the plot ( which can be very easy) You chuckle quite a few times as the story unfolds and what I like about it most is that it is a redeeming film.

Overall it was a solid movie.Their were some genuinely funny moments throughout the film. Plus the characters had a few odd but charming elements that made them fun to watch.The story wasn't the most original. It definitely felt like a movie we have seen a hundred times. Also while the characters were fun, they lacked any dimension. Often at times they just felt like caricatures rather than developed characters.

Scenes may seem dizzy, but they're not at all. It is easy to understand and approachable by anyone. Overall, it's not a waste of time, nor of money (if you're the ""cinema"" person).",Logan Lucky
131,Semisonic,"Cute characters, mediocre plot",7,22 April 2018,"When Cohen brothers make a film, it seems as if its plot is secondary - almost irrelevant. Because the true beauty of their unique style is the characters and the little moments they share on screen. Like a real life in a miniature: pointless and sometimes even absurd at each particular moment - but priceless when put together.Steven Soderbergh is no novice in the cinema business, with an established style of his own. But this time, it seems, he decided to approach his clearly beloved topic of high-profile heists (let's not forget that the Ocean's Eleven franchise is a child of Soderbergh's creation) and do it in a ""characters first"" way. So instead of the likes of George Clooney and Brad Pitt and their impeccable smiles we have a bunch of amateurish looking hillbillies from West Virginia, a divorced father who's been laid off lately, his one-armed (sorry, one-handed!) brother and a trio of other brothers who look as if Kid Rock is their style icon. Together they are gonna try to pull off a heist only an American would fully appreciate: stealing a ton of cash from the company organizing the NASCAR races.If the ""characters first"" approach was indeed the goal, then it worked out beautifully. Channing Tatum and Adam Driver are so natural as brothers that in some close-ups you start seeing an even physical resemblance between those two, no matter how far apart their real looks are. And Daniel Craig, looking like a German rave band frontman from the 90's and talking like a true backwoods dweller, is simply brilliant. I mean, if there was a cinematographic award for the most unlikely character transformation, then this ""from Agent 007 to a hillbilly gangsta"" switch would be the hands-down winner.But this is where all the ""but""s start appearing. Because, after all those extraordinary gentlemen (and a few ladies to spruce up this team) finish introducing themselves and all their quirks are known, there's little Logan Lucky can offer to maintain the suspense and keep you involved. The heist itself is typical, its twists and turns may not be absolutely predictable but you definitely expect some second layer of events to reveal itself - and you get what you expected. The third act addition of Hilary Swank, a die-hard FBI investigator keen to put those responsible for the heist behind bars, does spice up things a little, but it's still not enough to make the film's final as intriguing as its opening.""Ocean's 7-Eleven"", a pun that the film makes of itself, is a nice way to describe Logan Lucky. A crime comedy without the high grades of pathos. But that pathos was actually essential to make Ocean's Eleven at least seem grand. Without it, the only thing left is some dudes trying to steal money in a quirky way. Yeah, the dudes were fun while it lasted, but the rest is the same old routine we've seen a hundred times. And no smoke screens or robotic hands could distract you enough to stop seeing that.",Logan Lucky
132,MichaelMRamey,Unique Heist Film,7,21 April 2018,"This has all the ingredients for your run of the mill heist film, but it's more gritty and feature a group of seemingly dumb criminals.

Highly recommend if you're into heist films, but would also recommend if you're looking for something different.",Logan Lucky
133,gcsman,Delightful characters in an engaging heist,7,21 September 2017,"I give this 'only' 7/10 but it's a good 7: I liked it. Paradoxically, it's a cerebral kind of plot that doesn't actually cut very deep or aim super-high, but it's thoroughly engaging as you see this small-scale heist scheme unfold. A whole lot of impossibly convoluted details are held back for a final 'reveal' at the end which is sort of a core dump of all the loose threads you thought were unexplained, but that's OK. My guess is that the directorial master Steven Soderbergh knew that if all of them were shown in their actual order it would just hold back the flow of the main story.The small-town characters are the real highlight though, and the main reason you'll go away smiling. The highlight for me was Adam Driver's bartender character Clyde (I admit the only other role I've seen Driver in is Kylo Ren where he was pretty underwhelming, so it was a revelation to see him do some first-rate work here). His accent and line delivery are just terrific. Channing Tatum is excellent as well, sympathetically underplaying the role of brother Jimmy who has a very simple goal in mind and starts off the whole chain of events. Effectively the third lead role is Daniel Craig as the jailbird Joe Bang who has an eccentric flair for thievery; he's excellent too (though not quite as much as the Logan brothers). All together, the five Logan and Bang brothers and their cronies make up just about the most engaging and surreal group you'll ever see. They're such an odd dysfunctional mix from end to end that you wonder how they could pull off anything, let alone an operation so complex that it would do credit to a Mission Impossible plot. The (huge!) cast of characters is filled out with nice roles by Katie Holmes, Hilary Swank, Sebastian Stan, and a few other familiar faces.Watch especially for an episode in the middle where the prisoners go on strike and barricade the mess hall. Their demands include more Game of Thrones videos (they want to see more of 'that hot chick with the dragons'). Believe it or not, this is actually essential to the plot.Logan Lucky is fun built on a meticulously constructed plot and engaging characters you'll remember long after walking out. Kudos all around to Steven Soderbergh.",Logan Lucky
134,PotassiumMan,"Caper film has a sluggish start, comes up a tad short",6,1 September 2017,"If this film is Soderbergh's return from his brief retirement, his craft is a touch rusty. Not for nothing, his style of filmmaking is uniquely dynamic and almost always has a crisp air of confidence. Here, that kind of verve is largely absent and the narrative is curiously tentative and low-key for much of the early part of the film. This surprising lethargy is not terminal, thankfully.This film seeks to emulate Soderbergh's work in Ocean's Eleven, but with a scruffy, backwoods, up-from-the-bootstraps kind of flavor. This heist story centers around two redneck brothers (Tatum and Driver) in West Virginia, both of whom have a sad history of setbacks and little to show for as grown men, who boldly decide to pull off a robbery of the Charlotte Motor Speedway right around the height of NASCAR season. They enlist the help of a skilled explosives expert who is still in prison (Daniel Craig) and their erstwhile law-abiding sister (Keough).No one can fault the performances. Everyone here excels with what the script affords, especially Craig, Tatum and Driver. I never had much of an impression of Riley Keough's screen presence before, but I know it now and she's quite good in this. Unfortunately, a lot of acting talent is squandered in smallish, thankless roles. Katherine Waterston is one example as a medical practitioner who happens upon Tatum. Katie Holmes, although quite good as Tatum's scornful ex-wife, fades into the background. And Hilary Swank gets way too little screen time with a law enforcement role that she clearly has fun with. On the bright side, it sure is nice to see a familiar face from Wedding Crashers in the person of Dwight Yoakam as a somewhat clueless prison warden.But the film's muddled first half is molasses slow and so low-energy that it feels like an eternity before we get to the greatly anticipated heist. At that point, the film takes on the more brisk pacing and vitality you would expect from Soderbergh, but it's a bit too late. I try to look at the big picture and call this a near-miss, mostly because this is still a joyful portrayal of a criminal scheme perpetrated by a bunch of dim bulbs with a little help from a hardened, smug professional. And a wonderfully touching rendition of John Denver's ""Country Roads"" adds to this film's plus side. Recommended to those looking for carefree, lowbrow fun.",Logan Lucky
135,rutzelb,Pretty Good,7,30 November 2017,"Brothers Jimmy Logan (Channing Tatum) and Clyde, who lost his left arm in the war in Afghanistan,(Adam Driver) figure a way to rob the NASACR Motor Speedway in Charlotte , NC during a big Cocoa Cola 600 Race. They realize they need help and get Clyde sent to jail to meet Joe Bang (Daniel Craig) who they need to help with the heist as he is an explosives expert. This is pretty good and the heist is quite complicated as you will see. Appears there were sink holes in the center of the speedway and a construction crew was handling the repairs. Jimmy was fired from his job there, but learned how the money was gathered during the race under the raceway. Quite clever. Notables: Katie Holmes as Bobbi Jo, the former wife of Jimmy; Seth MacFarlane as Max Chilbain an annoying British Drink Salesman; Riley Keough as Mellie, a hair dresser and who was the driver to get Joe Bang and Clyde to the race track to do the heist; Dwight Yoakam as Warden Burns; Hilary Swank as FBI Agent Sarah, who is in charge of the investigation to the race track robbery; and Farrah Mackenzie as Sadie, Jimmy's daughter.Quite enjoyable, but I had to do a double take when the robbery is discovered and we are told that the police found the money in garbage bags behind a gas station. What? Now here's the thing. We see FBI Sarah in the bar asking Clyde for a drink and she says it 's bad luck to drink alone. Then we see Clyde give her the drink and she has her right arm on the bar.

136,danielharden,Ocean's 7/11,7,20 September 2017,"The 2013 crime thriller Side Effects was meant to mark the feature film retirement of Steven Soderbergh, director of the Ocean's trilogy and Magic Mike. Fortunately, Soderbergh's retirement would be short- lived, lasting a total of 4 years. Now, after dabbling in television with the TV movie, Behind the Candelabra and TV show The Knick, Soderbergh makes his return to cinema with yet another heist film, this one being Logan Lucky. Soderbergh proves once again he is a talented director and can pull off the cinematic magic trick that is the heist movie. Be that as it may, Logan Lucky does feel far too similar to Soderbergh's greatest cinematic success, Ocean's Eleven. Fortunately, however, Soderbergh is aware of this and so creates interesting characters and obtains fantastic performances from his actors, which together save Logan Lucky from total self-plagiarism.Logan Lucky is a heist movie, a beautifully shot, directed and written heist movie, nothing more and nothing less. And so it is easy to classify the film as unoriginal and a regurgitation of Soderbergh's previous work. To an extent, this is correct, from a story, plot and narrative point of view, Logan Lucky is a hillbilly version of Ocean's Eleven, but from a character and setting point of view, it is not. Whoever the mysterious Rebecca Blunt may be, they have written this film as best it could've been, that being a lighthearted and fun heist film, filled with entertaining characters and dialogue exchanges. Logan Lucky isn't the laugh-out-loud comedy of the year as some have alluded to, but it is, however, a fun and enjoyable film thanks in large part to the films phenomenal cast.As stated in the aforementioned paragraphs, the film's script creates intriguing characters with entertaining dialogue exchanges made all the more pleasurable by the fantastic ensemble cast. Channing Tatum and Adam Driver work very well together and are believable as brothers. The two also perform well in their own right as well as interacting with one another. This being said, Channing Tatum and Adam Driver may be the leads in this film, but they aren't the stars of Logan Lucky. The star is Daniel Craig. Craig steals every scene he's in as the bomb expert Joe Bang. He completely transforms himself away from his clean-cut-yet-rough-around-the- edges James Bond image, to completely embody the southern American prison inmate he plays in this film. Craig swaps charm with charisma and completely shines in Logan Lucky. This is one of the very few times I haven't seen the actor in a character, I only could see the character. I believed I was watching Joe Bang not Daniel Craig as Joe Bang. This is by far one of the best supporting actor performances of 2017.Aside from the unoriginality of the film's narrative, Logan Lucky lacks a crucial aspect in storytelling that prevents you from really caring about the action that takes place, this is character motivation. Logan Lucky is unclear as to why any character plays their part in this heist. Why does Clyde get involved so easy when he tells Jimmy his criminal days are behind him? Why does Joe Bang go along with the Logan's complicated plan to sneak him in and out of prison when he has 5 months left until release? Would he really risk more time on his sentence on a plan held together by human stupidity and coincidence? Probably not. It's not that these motivations are unclear, it's that they just aren't there. As a consequence of this, the stakes don't feel as high and again, as I've already mentioned, you cannot get invested in any of the characters.Overall, Logan Lucky is a fun time to be had. With beautiful cinematography by Steven Soderbergh, marvellous directing by Steven Soderbergh and an amusing script probably written by Steven Soderbergh, Logan Lucky is a pleasant watch. It's not a hilarious and wacky roller coaster ride of a film, nor is it one you can truly invest in, but it's a brilliantly well acted and light-hearted film that starts Soderbergh's return on a high.",Logan Lucky

139,joshbarton15,Hillbilly heist feels a little long in the tooth,6,28 August 2017,"Steven Soderbergh is no stranger to a crime caper having made the Ocean's trilogy, a series of films so slick they'll have you thinking it's the easiest thing ever to steal from a Las Vegas casino. With the tagline 'See how the other half steals', Logan Lucky feels like a companion piece to Soderbergh's earlier works, though replace the slickness with slackness. The Logan brothers, Jimmy (Channing Tatum) and Clyde (Adam Driver), hatch a plan to pull of a heist during a NASCAR race in North Carolina. Needing to recruit help for the job, the brothers turn to notorious safecracker Joe Bang (Daniel Craig) in their bid to steal a fortune.Soderbergh's Logan Lucky really did have a lot going for it; an interesting setup, some far from average characters and a pretty impressive ensemble cast being the key features that had me anticipating the film greatly. These were the things I ultimately ending up liking the most about Logan Lucky however, the sluggish pace feels as if it stops the film from being great.This is a quirky story about oddballs pulling off a daring heist but it's almost as if the film doesn't understand this, dragging out its narrative to the point where it all feels far too long. The characters are interesting and their exchanges are mostly entertaining but this film should have moved along much quicker than it did, the final twenty minutes almost reaching a state of stagnation.The father/daughter relationship that drives the narrative is one of the highlights of the film, culminating in a rather touching moment involving a beauty pageant and John Denver. It's a moment that surprised me, something I can't say about the moments of humour in the film, having had literally all of them shown in trailers for the film. It's a trend that just simply has to stop.Coming to the performances, Logan Lucky features an ensemble cast of varying experience but similar quality, from Riley Keough's white-trash Mellie Logan through to Daniel Craig's Joe Bang, characters from other ends of the scale but both performed well. In fact, this is Craig as you've never seen him before and he shows why he's so highly rated as an actor here.Logan Lucky is another Steven Soderbergh film performed with plenty of capability and kept entertaining enough through the characters and narrative, even if it runs the risk of outstaying its welcome.

144,intrepidami,This movie was so bad I was more interested in why the Critics are acting like cult members reviewing it.,1,21 August 2017,"It's truly the overblown, fake reviewed movie version of Dianetics! They bought their own books to make it look like a fantastic bestseller.I've seen people praise it because they feel it accurately portrays Southerners! Holy stereotyping 200,000,000 people Batman! This is what these kids truly think nowadays, about half the country!OK here we got Channing Tatum, a guy who gets fired, and decided to rob the Coca-Cola 600. He's not a likable person. He's not doing this out of revenge or anything, and somebody even says ""What did NASCAR ever do to you?"" to which there's no response? There's no build up of a relationship with the recruits.They, like the critics simply go along because hey, it's Channing, our secret boy crush.People say what Channing does in the end is a plot twist. Really? We were shown nothing to make us think he wouldn't screw everybody over? When I read review after review that praises this, I really wonder if half the reviewers actually sat through the movie? Honest to God, not one outburst of laughter from a full audience! Yet it's constantly referred to in reviews as a fun, funny, hilarious movie. The only other conclusion is...reviewers are getting paid off? Everybody is stupid a sa rock! Everybody(underlying, subtle theme Southerners, NASCAR is for retarded rednecks)but not in a dumb and dumber comedic way. In an insulting the entire South way. Way to alienate your paying customers!You know, I never really got the pretentious Oceans movies, anyway. They're simply big cast throw together movies. And now they're making an all female version? They're Love Boat with a heist. Do people really worship the hip new movie stars instead of a deity, nowadays?How bad, miscast, and trying to be funny, but falling flat is this movie? Imagine dubbing James Bond with Huckleberry Hounds VOICE AND ACCENT and restraining somebody and making them watch it for 2 hours.I see Rex Reed pretty much agrees with my assessment. All the other critics are acting like they discovered Soderbergh's Godfather 11.One more thing, the Screenwriter is not a real person. This is being tossed around as cool, and vogue.

145,paulijcalderon,A calm summer breeze,6,29 August 2017,"The marketing would make you think that this a funny heist caper kind of movie like ""Ocean's Eleven"" but more of a southern version of it. Just know that there's no laugh out loud moments at all. I'd describe the humorous vibe as amusing and laid back. It's the story of the Logan's who team up with the Bang's to rob the Charlotte Motor Speedway during a race. The story is classic with a neat concept. The characters are all unique and feel like living every day folks. That's perfectly alright and I also feel like the film emphasizes that by letting the shots breath a lot. Many scenes play out in long takes with few cuts, and that makes it look like you are watching real life on screen with characters who don't seem to be in a hurry. But given that the movie is so laid back it made it difficult for things to get moving until about half way through. It struggles a bit tonally by the mid portion. It does get better, but you can't deny that it's slow at times. I don't mind an easier pace that takes its time. That being said I unfortunately felt the run-time ticking in this one. Once the plan of the heist starts getting into motion the story picks up.Some odd camera shakes were noticeable on some instances. It seems like they maybe had an unsteady dolly or rail. I can't decide if that added to the charm or if it distracted me from the movie. Otherwise there are no issues technically and it looks neat with all the wide shots. I just had that problem of not really understanding what type of movie it wanted to be. Did it want to be more of a nice drama or more like crime thriller? It's shifty with it never being one of both. It's sort of its own genre. I find it difficult to recommend it and yet I don't really mind it. My thoughts are basically somewhat mixed. I enjoyed the character interactions and the score, but if only the pace had been better. I'll say this though; there is a part of the movie just nearing the final act where I felt strong sympathy for the people behind the heist. One shot in particular just really got me out of nowhere. I had nothing against the characters, but an emotional connection for us to care more about them was missing. Until that part that happen that is. So it got me by surprise. My final thoughts are that the end result is just about OK. Underwhelming at times, but I saw nothing flat out bad. The best thing I can say about the film is that it plays out like a pleasant summer breeze on a slow day.",Logan Lucky

He's proves that he can be much more than just James Bond.But then you also have Seth MacFarlane, Katie Holmes, and a surprise actor at the end who were all terrible. MacFarlane's voice faded in and out from being an Australian accent to Stewie's voice from Family Guy. He doesn't have a ton to do in the movie, but he was pretty unbearable when he was on screen. I don't think I've ever liked Katie Holmes in a movie, and she was pretty atrocious in this. I'd say the entertainment value is also 50/50. There were parts of this movie, especially during the actual heist, where I was pretty engaged. I was locked in and entertained by what was going on.

This is definitely going for the out there farcical nature that Soderbergh brought to The Informant!. Each character is a little goofy in nature. They represent a different Southern archetype down on their luck. It was a little funny in some spots. Most of them were featured in the trailers for this film. This is something that Steven Soderbergh could do in his sleep. It's a heist film where it seems like nothing can ever go right for this family. People look down on them and nothing seems to ever go right for our protagonist Channing Tatum. There is a hint of melancholy to these people. While the movie wants you to laugh at them, they are really getting one over on you. It is a bit of misdirection which is embedded in the DNA of a heist film. In the grand scheme of things, this movie is a fly by film. It's fine when you watch it. You can casually catch most of it and understand everything even if you're barely watching it. It's a heist movie and it follows that formula to a tee with little to no variations. It's fine. I give this movie a C.",Logan Lucky

Combined with his one armed, sorry one handed bartender: brother Clyde (Adam Driver) who is depressed by his theory of misfortune that seems to follow he Logan family, and his stylist sister Mellie (Reily Keough) making the caper a nice family event. To assist them in breaking into this vault under the race track, the Logan's need to recruit ""IN-CAR-CER-RA-TED"" Joe Bang (Daniel Craig). Craig leaving his comfortable British charm, for a mad southern criminal.Soderbergh on familiar territory with a new caper film, from the director of the Oceans movies, Soderbergh definitely knows how to make a fun and exciting heist film. With a simple three act structure, of the plan, heist, and aftermath, Logan Lucky is enjoyable journey following our characters, debating whether we should really be on their side, until we see Hilary Swank's face, we know who the actual villain is.The main joy of Logan Lucky is the characters and the ridiculous banter shared between them in the hilariously written dialogue. From one arm jokes, to making explosives with gummy bears, to one scene that will tickle the Game of Thrones fans.Channing Tatum's Jimmy Logan is our classic anti-hero, very much lives or his daughter, with down hill life direction, we very much understand his need for this great money caper. Adam Driver's one handed Clyde Logan has a very emotionless personality but with an amusing southern accent and plastic arm provides many moments of humor. But its very agreeable to say that Craig is the standout performer, as Joe Bang. With his bleach white hair, strong southern accent, and high energy makes Craig very unrecognisable, but very entertaining and fun to watch. Another delightful character is also the supporting obnoxious British race car driver Max Chilblain (Seth MacFarlane) who also with an over the top British accent adds more hilarity in personalities to the group southern accents.Its also fare to say that the film is at its strongest during the heist during the second act, which makes the rest of the film rather inferior but still enjoyable. With all the excitement, jokes and southern accents, does make Logan Lucky a very intoxicating hill Biliy cinema venture. 7.8/10",Logan Lucky

154,vsks,Robbing NASCAR? What Can Go Wrong?,8,5 October 2017,"Need a 119-minute break from the news headlines? This Steven Soderbergh caper comedy, script by Rebecca Blunt, may be just the thing. There's nothing too serious going on (a planned heist at NASCAR's big Memorial Day weekend race), but the characters are so well-developed and their robbery plot so complicated and devious, your attention is captured from the outset. Channing Tatum plays Jimmy Logan, out of work and, if his ex-wife has her way, out of his young daughter's life. He needs money. He proposes the theft to his brother Clyde (Adam Driver), the serious one, a bartender who lost an arm in Afghanistan. Clyde is reluctant, because he's convinced every family enterprise is destined for disaster—""the curse of the Logans."" Love how he whips up a martini one-handed to quiet a mouthy British patron (Seth MacFarlane)! Their sister Mellie (Riley Keough), a beautician, is in on it too and gets sweet revenge on an irritating client who drives a purple Caddy. See that for yourself. To pull off this daring crime, the brothers need help. Unfortunately, the one man they know who really knows how to blow a safe is in prison. Part of their plan is to spring him for a day. Daniel Craig plays prisoner Joe Bang, in ""a wonderfully wacky, show-stealing turn,"" said Todd McCarthy in The Hollywood Reporter. Joe insists his two brothers (Jack Quaid and Briain Gleeson) be brought into the plot, and the likelihood of success appears to plummet as these two slouch onto the scene. Prison warden Burns (Dwight Yoakam) is also a treat. Many funny moments, some relatively subtle. I particularly enjoyed the big race's opening ceremony, which deployed all the worst excesses of American sports jingoism.",Logan Lucky

156,shimenpf,"In my opinion, tried too hard to be clever",5,14 April 2020,"I have to be honest: I really tried to like the movie, but ultimately I couldn't. I enjoyed some of the performances and I liked many of the jokes but, scriptwise, the movie is very lacking.First of all, the first act felt too dialogue-heavy and lacked action. And I don't mean action as in punches or bazookas. I mean action as in something happening. Too much of the information was delivered through dialogue which isn't ideal.The second act had some entertaining moments. The recruiting and the heist were fairly good. However, I felt a lack of sense of structure in the script. The heist ends but the third act doesn't even start yet. We are introduced to a bunch of characters that really add too little to justify their appearance. For example: the nurse, which couldn't even count as a romantic interest as she only appears twice in the movie, Sebastian Stan's character, who's only purpose was to reject the other race guy's testimony (and this doesn't even happen on camera, but through a line from Hilary Swank's). Even the other race guy has no particular reason to be in the movie as his testimony never complicates the life for the protagonists and, therefore, adds nothing to the plot. And finally, Hilary Swank. I really don't understand the role of her character in the movie. It's a wannabe antagonist that never really antagonizes. She never, since she appears for the first time, complicates things for the protagonists. Not once. I don't understand why these characters appear or, if they will, why they are not given something more interesting to do.The movie also raised too many questions that, at least I, couldn't answer. I think this happened in a (and this is my opinion) failed attempt to be clever. For example, it is mentioned that an anonymous source confessed the location of the money. This was supposedly Channing Tatum. But why would he do it? They stole the money from Daniel Craig's brothers. Again, why? Was that the money that was given back? Why go through a lot of problems only to steal their money and give it back to the authorities? Why did Hilary Swank suddenly turn to the thieves side at the end, when flirting with Adam Driver?I don't know. The movie didn't do it for me. I feel there were too many loose ends and many unnecessary elements that could have been cut out. But that's just me.",Logan Lucky
157,texshelters,"The film has some big laugh lines and a lot of cleverness, but it is implausible to a fault.",4,27 August 2017,"Logan Lucky: Sometimes You're too Clever Logan Lucky (LL) is too clever for it's own good. The film has some big laugh lines and a lot of cleverness, but it is implausible to a fault. Sure, it's a work of fiction, but it has to pass the the credulity test. LL fails several times. The film involves a heist, a divorce, a prison break out and break in, car swapping, money swapping, wife swapping. Well, not the last one. Jimmy Logan (Channing Tatum) is a laid off worker looking for a score. Jimmy Logan's ex-wife played by Katie Holmes is poorly written and poorly acted. Holmes, in fact, is the worst part of the film. The characters in the film are stereotypes. Jimmy's brother, Clyde Logan played by Adam Driver, has a missing arm from fighting in Iraq. So the film makes a series of arm jokes that are funny at first and eventually play like bad schtick. Give it a rest. We get it!Daniel Craig is hilarious as Joe Bang, a munitions expert. However, his idiot brothers were so over the top as ""stupid mountain people"" that it balances out the hilarity of Craig's performance. Seth MacFarlane made a funny appearance, and I didn't even know it was him. That's a good thing, frankly. Talk about tired schtick. While character stereotypes can be funny, they can also be cliché. The cops in this movie were too stupid to believe and not funny. If you are going to make a believable heist movie, making the police impossibly stupid isn't the way to go. At least the FBI had some balls, so to speak. One of the funniest bits in the film involves prisoners rioters who can't have their demands met because certain books have not yet been published. It's a great homage, and that's all I am going to say about it. I am sure a clip of that seen will appear online in a a few months.The film is both irritatingly illogical and surprisingly clever. Another run through on the script would have helped, but then again, it wasn't trying to be Game of Thrones or something. If it was, someone would have had to die. Or did they?Rating: Rent it, if only for Craig's performance. See ""Hell or High Water"" or ""Heist"" for a better written and more entertaining heist experience. . Peace, Tex Shelters",Logan Lucky
158,filmtravel101,Slow Boring and Beyond Dull - Terrible Script -,4,18 August 2017,This has to be one of the worst of Steven's movies. The script and directing was horrible. The characters and pace of the movie was so slow and highly unrealistic that many people just walked out of the theatre.There is not really a lot of comedy or smart set ups like Ocean 11 movies and instead it is a meandering of endless short set ups by idiot red necks that at first you think just perhaps there is some back story that convinces us that they are really sharp like in Ocean 11 - but they are not and it just gets tiresome and the directing is amateurish with no style whatsoever and silly characters that do not add up to any clever thriller or comedy.It is shocking to see 90% on Rotten Tomatoes or even a 7 on here. The end has little punch and you're so exhausted and bored out of your mind even with great actors but the pay off is unrealistic and you no longer care except to want to slap the writer and director for even making the stupid movie and wasting the great actors.

163,makleen2,A Trailer Park Ocean's Eleven,7,2 October 2017,"Logan Lucky is a black comedy heist film written by Rebecca Blunt and directed by Steven Soderbergh of Ocean's Eleven (2001), Traffic (2000), and Erin Brockovich (2000) fame. ""Rebecca Blunt"" is an unknown British screenwriter, which has led some to speculate the name is a pseudonym. Whatever the case, it's a fun movie with the same fast-paced and clever film making as the Ocean's series.When Jimmy Logan's (Channing Tatum) ex-wife, Bobbie Jo Chapman (Katie Holmes), plans to take their daughter, Sadie (Farrah Mackenzie), from West Virginia to North Carolina with her new husband, Moody Chapman (David Denman), two Appalachian families rob the Charlotte Motor Speedway during the Coca-Cola 600 to pay for a lawyer to contest the move. The threat of the ""Logan family curse"" hangs ominously over the operation.Jimmy is aided by his one-handed brother, Clyde (Adam Driver), their sister, Mellie (Riley Keough), and Joe Bang (Daniel Craig) and his brothers Fish (Jack Quaid) and Sam (Brian Gleeson). Together, this crew of eccentric misfits pulls off the heist and each lives happily ever after, or so it seems. In the final scene, we see a FBI agent played by Hilary Swank carefully watching them under cover.The song ""Take Me Home, Country Roads"" by John Denver, a nostalgic tribute to West Virginia, frames the movie. As it opens, we see Jimmy Logan and his daughter fixing a truck while listening to the song. Near the end, Sadie gives an unpracticed but heartfelt rendition of the song during the talent portion of a beauty contest, winning over the audience and judges.In Logan Lucky, everyone seems to get what they want, except Jimmy Logan himself. Sadie wins the beauty contest, Joe Bang replaces the money his wife stole, Clyde gets a mechanical hand, Sylvia Harrison (Katherine Waterston) receives a large donation for her mobile free clinic, and even the Charlotte Motor Speedway gets a huge insurance payout after the robbery. But Jimmy's original purpose for stealing the money goes unfulfilled.Because Logan Lucky was deliberately crafted as a ""poor man's Ocean's Eleven,"" it's difficult to evaluate one without the other. Both are entertaining, fast-paced, smart, and a little subversive, but Logan Lucky fails in areas where Ocean's Eleven succeeded, particularly in the realm of character development.With such an ensemble cast, it was difficult to follow all the characters' motivations. In Oceans Eleven it was easy because they were all thieves and their motivation was obvious, to get rich and pull off the most daring heist in history–to do something no criminal has ever done before.In Logan Lucky, Jimmy Logan's motivation is explained, but most of his accomplices are just average people who are trying to put past transgressions behind them. His sister, Mellie, seems to be just going along with the scheme for no reason at all. No one even really tries to talk him out of it.The characters in Ocean's Eleven are likable and have fully-developed personalities. Despite being criminals, we want to spend time with those characters and hope they succeed. In contrast, personality quirks substitute for genuine personalities in Logan Lucky, and we never feel animus for the Charlotte Motor Speedway like we did for casino owner Terry Benedict.Joe Bang likes to eat boiled eggs. Clyde Logan has one hand and obsesses over the Logan family curse. Fish and Sam ""got right with the Lord"" and enjoy hanging out at the carnival. Mellie is a hair stylist. Beyond repetition of these character traits, they are just weird and gross people.Moody Chapman, in contrast, seems like an upstanding guy, despite a questionable approach to parenting (his sons, played by Boden and Sutton Johnston, are hilarious). Despite Bobbie Jo having full custody of Sadie, he has no problem with Jimmy Logan spending time with his daughter and tries to treat both Jimmy and Mellie as family. For his efforts, they make fun of him, reject his overtures, and even trash his sports car. The audience is supposed to sympathize with these jerks?Despite these shortcomings, Logan Lucky is a well-made and entertaining film that's fun to watch and keeps the audience on its toes. It plays on Southern stereotypes but not in a condescending or demeaning way. It continues the tradition of ""white trash"" comedies including Raising Arizona (1987) and O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000) and is a welcome departure from the other lazy, poorly written and acted comedies released this year.",Logan Lucky
164,spiritof67,Not The Film You'd Think,8,29 August 2017,"I saw this film at a drive-in, and it was the second film in the double feature I had gone to see. For the culturally deprived, drive-ins still show two features. Anyway, this film was a revelation. At first I had expected that the working-class characters would fall into their designated stereotypes and we'd chug along to an easily-expected finish.Not so much.Actually, the characters were nicely filled out, there were stereotypes but not the ones I expected, and the movie had some rather nice convolutions to it and contrary to some other reviewers I found the late-arriving Hillary Swank to be a really interesting addition to the cast - and a possible bell-weather to a sequel. Just sayin'. There was comedy, drama, some real-world concerns and a lot more. Go see it. The cast and script alone will make it worth your while.",Logan Lucky
165,trevor-82944,The Same Satisfactory Self-Worship We're All Used To,4,18 August 2017,"The ultimate verdict: Logan Lucky achieves both everything and nothing you expect out of a modernized crime/comedy/western.The story here focuses on Jimmy Logan, a recently divorced construction worker laid off due to his fractured leg. He enlightens his spirits, as well as our own, from his father-daughter bond right in the first frame as he repairs his car, when he tells her a story about his favorite country song. I admit these sweet moments were severely underdone, but not nearly as much as the activity of his gorgeous ex-wife, who creates zero memorability besides wearing a see-through top over a pink bra in front of her eight-year-old daughter. Matters instead revolve more about the men in the community, particularly the somewhat meaningful bond between Jimmy and his brother, a one-armed Iraqi veteran who can mix a martini one-handed.Yet everything else about this part of the United States falls into stereotypes about the culture, right down to two rednecks competing in a toilet seat ring toss. Those two guys end up being probably the most memorable characters who create the most potential comedy; now I say potential because the ""comedy"" here just lazily paints authoritative figures as gullible doofuses, especially by the third act when it turns into an unresolved ""Crime Scene Investigation"" plot from the FBI's perspective.Despite the goal toward a crime/comedy, the gags' staging missed their mark entirely—the timing of the editing never played against the audience's expectations.At least they do go a bit into intriguing detail about the robbery's execution, down to a step-by-step process posted onto the refrigerator. It shows these fun little bits which make you think, ""What on earth do they plan to do with those cockroaches coated in nail polish?"" Then later you think, ""Oh! Ha! Clever!"" The details enlighten your attention, like how the number of times a plastic bag is twisted shut matters in making the contents explode.Although the culture's creation here does seem a smidgen off. I hadn't lived there longer than three months, yet I know for certain that African Americans thrive elsewhere beyond the prisons. The fact that one of those crooks, played with a convincing accent by James Bond actor Daniel Craig, escapes jail to help others commit their robbery draws one common conclusion: the US's most vibrant criminal culture thrives in the Southeast. While true in some regards, we deserve to see some light down there too.Yes, the worldbuilding basically just got the job done well enough. The same goes to the acting—the best they achieve from their effort is simply sustaining your attention. Yet the smaller performances are really the more effective ones, as Hilary Swank (Boys Don't Cry, Million Dollar Baby) made the most out of her small part, playing an investigator with her expected authoritative enthusiasm. The director, Steven Soderbergh, (Erin Brockovich, Traffic) proved his strength at casting seventeen years after beating himself at the Oscars, you see each well-known actor only as the character they portray. However, the way Soderbergh organizes the moments of his story is distractingly wrong.Soderbergh displays lots of detailed love for the East Coast's racing culture, such as a fiery feud between a rude racer who insults the two disabled leads. It feels truer to the culture than what the financially successful Cars franchise attempted. But I think Soderbergh misunderstands something important: very few people, particularly outside the East Coast, care as much about NASCAR as he does, a distraction at best in the way he flaunts the commercialism.The bits at the car race, in particular, abuse too many lingering shots on the fans and bumper stickers, like one big NASCAR commercial. They even blare the name of ""Fox News"" when showing the game's commentators.You could honestly tell this was screenwriter Rebecca Blunt's first ever writing credit, no craft goes into sending out any kind of motivation to anyone besides the two brothers to achieve anything, which hurts the film all the more, particularly with its unresolved established family commitment. Nobody learns anything, they all just exist as catalysts towards material gain.Even if you lived in the southeast, you will most possibly forget the name Logan Lucky the next day. You'd be better off watching a car race live or watching CSI Miami, both a far more rewarding social experience.",Logan Lucky

It hits a lot of the same beats: show the heist, keep secrets of the operation from the audience, then flashback to reveal how the heist actually happened. But it's still enjoyable. The characters are likable, shown to have good morals, but living on hard times. My main complaint as far as the acting goes is the Appalachian accents.

If you are looking for a serious heist film with serious characters you are not going to like this. But if you would like to see a fun film with offbeat humour that does not take itself too seriously, about a group of hillbillies trying to pull of a super challenging robbery and where everything is over the top, from the story to the characters, than look no further. It has some good jokes, great performances from Daniel Craig and Adam Driver and a great soundtrack. Give it a chance if you would like to relax and have a few laughs on the account of the protagonists of this film.",Logan Lucky

172,parleon-thedon,Logan Lucky - Movie Review,7,21 August 2017,"Jimmy Logan orchestrates a plan to rob the Charlotte Motor Speedway in North Carolina. This movie has an amazing cast of actors who play against their usual character types. Daniel Craig and Adam Driver play Joe Bang and Clyde Logan, and they have all of the best scenes. All of the other actors are fine, but Daniel Craig and Adam Driver carry this pretty dull movie. This movie is slow and boring during the initial part, but the latter half is the most interesting. My one real gripe is that most of the cast had nothing to do with each other. Some characters just showed up, did their jobs, and then disappeared until the end.For a more in-depth review, check out my video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uwgh8CQiOas",Logan Lucky

The cast, obviously, is loaded with talent and their performances are outstanding. The premise was reminiscent of How To Beat The High Cost Of Living, but not a remake. (HTBTHCOL is a classic.) It reminds me of Juno and Fargo and a few other movies in the way some of the dialogue is, while not emotionless, isn't animated.It's a quirky film at times, but I was laughing a lot. It's well worth the time to watch.",Logan Lucky
174,Eric266,Hillbilly Heist,7,2 March 2018,"Logan Lucky is a sweet film that seems to know what it wants to be. There is no pretension here of trying to be a bigger film or trying to have a message. Its just a quirky film with a lot of good actors having fun making a movie.Channing Tatum plays Jimmie Logan, a former high school football star whose injury ended his chance for glory. He is struggling to make ends meet and be a good dad to his daughter, Sadie (Farrah McKenzie). His ex-wife (Katie Holmes) wants to take Sadie to another state with her new successful husband. His sister, Mellie (Riley Keough) is a supportive influence on both Jimmie and Sadie. Jimmie's brother, Clyde (Adam Driver) is an ex-Marine who lost his arm in a military assault and now runs a bar. Daniel Craig shows up, sans his Bond charm, as Joe Bang, a convict with a talent for explosives. Together they plan to steal cash from a NASCAR race. As I said, the film doesn't try to be more than a silly heist film. The characters are all a bit off, but they are endearing. The heist itself is inventive and goes off about as expected. Then two FBI agents show up (one played by Hilary Swank; where did her career go?) and the men have to keep one step ahead of the feds.Farrah McKenzie as Jimmie's daughter steals the show. She is sweet, cute, and loves her daddy, no matter what. The actress has a bright future in the industry and she held her own against some pretty impressive actors. The only low points were Katie Holmes as the ex-wife (she was wasted) and Seth McFarland as a snobbish NASCAR team owner. He effects a British accent and a weird wig I guess to avoid any connection to Family Guy. The movie breezes along and there are some laughs along the way. There is also an Oceans-11 style twist at the end where you are shown some scenes about what happened earlier off camera which makes some of the results make more sense. It was a fun film as long as you don't take it too seriously.",Logan Lucky
175,ranblackman,Oceans Eleven At The Speedway.,7,16 April 2019,"This is the best way to view this movie. It had all the flair, all the shape directing and wiring, combined with wit, that Soderbegs previous oceans trilogy had. The major difference here is that it moves things to NASCAR's Charlotte motor speedway, wherein a set is moved forward from inside and under the very infield where millions of dollars are stored.The cast here really makes this movie. They are all playing the rough redneck characters and clearly sinking right into their homes with ease. Daniel Craig as a bomb expert is the best if these. We have a lot of layers to the best, various kits and distractions they are using to make the best work. These involved prisons and banks. It all comes together and is fun to watch.The actors play the characters well, but there is not a whole lot of depth to them. It's pretty basic, but not really what I would call bad. I would say if you enjoy heist movie, enjoy sharp comedies, this will likely give you a good time. I'd say it's a rental, but a fun one last that.",Logan Lucky
176,shadow_blade-89459,Dwon South Robbery,7,17 February 2018,"""Logan Lucky"" (2017) is comical crime drama where two brothers attempt to pull off a racecar heist that effectively takes all the glitter and glam out of big movie crime films and turns it into a literal ""could this really happen"" type of film. The film is about Jimmy Logan, played by Channing Tatum, who after being fired from his job finds out his daughter's mother Bobbie Jo, played by Katie Holmes, who has full custody, plans to move away from their small town with her husband Moody, played by David Denman. Jimmy enlists his siblings Clyde, played by Adam Driver, Mellie, played by Riley Keough, and incarcerated bank robber Joe Bang, played by Daniel Craig, to rob the Charlotte Motor Speedway during a NASCAR Race. The film is chalked full of celebrities including comical genius Seth MacFarlane, but the comedic aspect was a miss for me. However, the missed comedy cues did not take away from the elaborate build up of the crime of the century. I think the story of this film may have looked better on paper than in film. The trailer appears to have taken all the moments that where ""side splitting"" funny and spoiled the comical aspects of the film. The robbery and reveal however is classic Steven Soderbergh and I loved it. The acting in this film seemed above average for some and plain odd for others, particularly at the end. I really appreciated the director, Steven Soderbergh, not overly playing to the race itself because I would have been lost interest as I am not a fan of NASCAR, but the quality of the shots he did show made me a little more attentive. This film is some how high class, yet down to earth visually. I think this film is worth viewing even if its missing the comical aspect.",Logan Lucky
177,aquascape,Retirement couldn't stop Soderbergh,8,29 March 2018,"Steven Soderbergh fooled us all when he stated that he is done with filmmaking and will retire. Luckily for us, he didn't go through with his promise and now we get to see this wonderful composition called ""Logan Lucky"".""Logan Lucky"" has a star studded cast, with Channing Tatum, Adam Driver and Daniel Craig having high notes. I don't know who to point out in particular as they give terrific performance, but if I had to choose it would be Adam Driver, who played Tatum's prosthetic arm wearing brother. 
The film portrays the lifestyles of country folks but shedding it in a good light, especially the affectionate relationship between former high school classmates Jimmy Logan and Sylvia Harrison, played by Channing Tatum and Katherine Waterston.The whole movie had a very Coen-esque vibe to it, taking a shot at the black comedy genre. Soderbergh shows that he did not lose form after briefly spending time apart from film making. His style that was captured in ""Out of Sight"" seems to have resurfaced again with ""Logan Lucky"".""Logan Lucky"" is goofy film definitely worth a view, even for non-Soderbergh fans.",Logan Lucky

180,amexspam,Somewhere in there should be a good movie.,4,19 September 2017,"Slooooow. I believe some of the tedium was intentional (i.e. these are mentally dim characters so everything they say or do is slow), but the scenes felt heavy handed and went on too long in trying to make sure that everyone watching would understand what the scene was trying to say. And there were far too many subplots that were either unnecessary or didn't go anywhere. The actors did a great job with what they had to work with, there were many excellent performances, and the main plot was clever, but the direction was poor. With a better director this might have been a good movie.Finally, I think they owe the citizens of West Virginia an apology for making every character a stereotypical ""southern country folk"".

181,CinePendejo,Ocean's Eleven but with guys from a Chevy Truck commercial. Go See This!!,8,21 August 2017,"If anyone were to ask me what was the best filmmaker barely anyone had heard of, I would tell them it would be Steven Soderbergh. Sure, we can recall works from Christopher Nolan, Edgar Wright, The Wachowskis, Spielberg, etc. but they never consider the sly brilliance of Soderbergh's work. The man who made OCEAN'S ELEVEN, TRAFFIC, MAGIC MIKE, SIDE EFFECTS, OUT OF SIGHT, and THE INFORMANT, Soderbergh is a natural talent of crafting airtight entertainment who admittedly never really sought to be ""mainstream"" so much as he just like to do his own thing. But every time he pops his head out the tunnel he calls his ""semi-retirement"" he shows us just how easy pure crowd pleasers can be made, and LOGAN LUCKY is no different.Airtight, breezy, and full-stop hilarious, LOGAN LUCKY is a blast from start to finish. In a Hollywood climate that fails so hard in making good heist thrillers, this film succeeds in many ways that almost seem like showboating.Explaining the plot seems arbitrary, since it's basically OCEANS ELEVEN for Rednecks. A team of down-on-their-luck men plan an elaborate robbery from a place of riches. Instead of swinging upper class men, we get working class dudes from the rural south. Instead of the MGM Grand, it's the NASCAR derby. It seems like just yet another re-skinning of the original movie, but along the way feels like its own thing.Paying lovely attention to detail to it's Southern setting, the whole setting feels grounded and honest. Many other films that depict this sort of climate do so to make fun of it, but Soderbergh never goes that route. Even if the film objectively is a comedy, there's a real sincerity to the this place, immersing us to an era where country music means something dear to us and derby races were the hottest trend. There's a scene where one of the characters daughters sing his favorite country song in a pageant, and it's probably the most heartwarming tribute to the rural life that I've ever seen in a movie.And once we get to the actual heist, it looks about as cool as you expect. Just like the OCEAN films, the heist itself is little more than crazy elaborate scenarios that lead up to the big catch. Mark my words, guys; it gets stupidly elaborate, as if its orchestrated to tackle every minute loophole or detail to fend off those who try to question each plot hole of the heist. At one point they gain access to a bank with cockroaches in which it leads to a domino effect of conveniences. It's near implausible, but I never wanted it to stop.But if the heist was a really delicious cake, the performances would be the frosting. Adam Driver is great as a war vet with a secret temper that shook me by surprise. Channing Tatum's choice of going for comedic roles should be a staple for hot white actors for now on, but he imbues sincerity among his buffoonery. Katie Holmes looks near unrecognizable.Heck, even Seth McFarlane got a laugh out of me! But the biggest star here is Daniel Craig, who is a straight up revelation here. Constantly slogging looking plain dreadful in the BOND movies, he finally looks like he's having fun as an Australian bomb expert called Joe Bang and it pays off. He chews the scenery in every scene he's in, mixing a weird mixture of intimidation and cheesy ham.LOGAN LUCKY may not be totally perfect - Hillary Swank is trying too hard as a CIA agent, and the subplot with Katherine Waterson feels obligatory - but it is a rocking good time. With airtight editing, a breezy yet enjoyable heist, and an overall love to its setting, Soderbergh once again proves to be an unsung master yet again. Do not miss this!",Logan Lucky
182,thirtyfivestories,Theft is Two-Sided,6,20 September 2017,"The Logan family is West Virginia proud, and a little cursed. Jimmy romanticizes John Denver to his daughter while tinkering with his aged pick-up. Clyde is a technician when it comes to mixology at the town's bar. And Mellie chops years off of ladies' appearance at the cozy barber shop. The siblings found their respective fits, but Jimmy is gradually losing his place. Picking up his daughter, Sadie, means knocking on a mansion door in overalls. His ex-wife has upgraded, but he does not seem to mind. Sadie was always his greatest treasure, and riches have minimal domain over him. But his mountaineer comfort is expiring.Clyde speaks with deliberate spacing. His words only mean as much as the pauses between them. Jimmy respects his brother with canine loyalty. Clyde's superstitions do not hold weight with Jimmy, but believing the theory of a hexed lineage is only liable to make one timid. Jimmy gets drunk off of opportunity, and Clyde sounds alarms of collateral damages. Together, they find an equilibrium of homegrown precision.The boys are only 2/3 of the dream team though. Well maybe just half of it. The adhesive to every joint is Mellie. Her greatest advantage is her unsuspecting swagger. A confident sway that leaves bystanders robbed blind. Even though she is the driver, she often rides in the backseat. But then again, you always get bit from the snake you did not see. The bonds within the family and the accomplices they hand select speak to the genuine roots bedded in their Appalachian makeup. They can trust one another because they are kin with their neighbors. They are not required to divulge all the nitty gritty details of their schemes, but they do owe honesty and equality with their partners.Intelligence is not geographically monopolized. Cunning and forethought can find refuge in any common man or woman's mind. The brilliance of unexpected victories place figures in regional folklore. Their crimes are forgiven before they are committed, and a multitude of the unheard strikes laughter audible to the highest of offices. Luck falls on the deserving, and fortune rains on the humble.",Logan Lucky
183,nightwishouge,Southern twist on a familiar heist formula,7,16 April 2018,"Steven Soderbergh has never been one of my favorite directors, but you have to respect the diversity of his output. He appears to be about as whimsical as a filmmaker can be, given the dedication and discipline of such a medium, taking on projects as they intrigue him for the pure pleasure of the craft and the journey of the creation. I almost wonder if he even pays much attention when his films are released; it seems more likely he's already preoccupied at that point with whatever's next.Logan Lucky is another take on the ""cool heist"" subgenre already explored by Soderbergh in the Ocean's Eleven franchise. This one takes place in the South and leaves no character archetype of such a milieu unexploited. The cast is great, with Adam Driver's laconic, minimalistic performance as an ex-soldier-turned-bartender being the standout for me. He gives Buster Keaton a run for his money as far as brilliantly expressive stone-faced characters are concerned. Like a lot of heist movies (or con man films), the plot is a bit too intricate for its own good. Much of the fun in the first act of the film (the dry wit of the character interactions) subsides as the complexities of the plan are illustrated for the audience. Such movies tend to fall in love with the cleverness of their own mechanics, and that's not particularly what I'm there for. Fortunately there are a couple of uproarious set pieces sprinkled amidst the job itself that redeem all the exposition and the a-to-b-to-c logistics. It also takes too long to end. But I watched Logan Lucky with a group of friends and it was a definite crowd-pleaser, so obviously the flaws are not overwhelming.",Logan Lucky

There were about 20 people in the theater when I saw it and five of them left very early into the film. It is VERY boring and dumb.Is it a NASCAR film? No. The NASCAR portion of the film only materializes near the end of the film.Is it worth seeing? No. It was the longest 2-hours of my life.

Logan Lucky has a lot of Soderbergh's trademarks such as lush cinematography, style over substance, and criminal-minded characters. In a trailer promising so much fun, the end result was quite a letdown. Logan Lucky is smarter than you would believe but it doesn't entertain with its slow pacing, dry humor, and over the top heist shenanigans.The ensemble was great and certain actors really shine in their moments like Seth MacFarlane, and Daniel Craig. However, the script was weak as there wasn't many funny lines (albeit one funny ransom request for the Game of Thrones books). Having everything work out perfectly for our characters was a bit of a surprise, but the movie never builds anything up resembling real drama or stakes to earn that surprise. Logan Lucky was well shot and cast, but was too boring, slow, unfunny and implausible to enjoy. If this is Soderbergh's last film, he will be missed, but if you are looking for a fun entertaining heist movie with a better cast go watch Ocean's Eleven.",Logan Lucky
187,cschultz-2,Warm and Low-Key Delight,8,27 August 2017,"The advertising for ""Logan Lucky"" includes the advertising slogan, ""See how the other half steals,"" and much of the publicity emphasizes the picture is directed by the filmmaker responsible for the popular heist comedy ""Ocean's 11."" The suggestion is that ""Logan Lucky"" is a sort of distaff version of ""Ocean's 11,"" one featuring unsophisticated rural Southerners instead of glib and glamorous Las Vegas wiseguys.And while that description is not exactly inaccurate, it's also not quite fair to the picture itself. The difference is in the picture's genuine sense of warmth.Far from satirizing his cast of characters, director Steven Soderbergh actually embraces them, and in the process creates an oddly heartwarming comedy in which the audience finds itself rooting against the traditional good guys, in favor of a demographic which usually doesn't receive much of a break in the popular American lexicon.""Logan Lucky"" details the adventures of an unemployed West Virginia construction worker who, at the end of his financial rope, hatches a scheme to rob the massive Charlotte Motor Speedway during the popular annual Coca-Cola 600 NASCAR race. And in order to carry off the heist, the would-be master criminal needs to recruit the most colorful group of accomplices this side of Mayberryor ""Deliverance.""Written by Rebecca Blunt—rumored to be a pseudonym for either the director's wife or Soderbergh himself—the script renders most of the characters underwritten, incomplete, and lacking in motivation. But instead of being a detriment to the picture, the absence of character complexity works in the movie's favor, allowing a remarkably talented group of players the additional space to inhabit their roles more fully.Led by the baleful and laconic Channing Tatum as the unemployed and desperate Jimmy Logan, most of the actors inhabit their characters so successfully that you'll have trouble recognizing even a few of the more familiar faces.Among those who all but vanish into their roles are Sebastian Stan, from the Marvel ""Captain America"" series of pictures, as a member of the Logan Gang, and country music superstar Dwight Yoakum as a prison warden. And even two-time Academy Award-winning actress Hilary Swank turns up relatively late in the game, as a straight-as- an-arrow FBI agent trying to crack the credibility-straining heart of the caper.In the meantime, the entire cast works together beautifully. Particularly noteworthy are Adam Driver, sporting an accent which leans more toward Missouri than West Virginia as Jimmy's partially- disabled Gulf War veteran brother Clyde, and a ridiculously funny Daniel Craig as the gang's demolitions expert, the appropriately- named Joe Bang. If the usually dour and humorless Craig is capable of this kind of relaxed and engaging comedy performance, it's little wonder that the actor reportedly feels restricted by his association with the phenomenally popular James Bond series of pictures.It's tough to not like a picture in which part of the main character's unlikely motivation as a criminal is to be a better parent to his daughter. And despite the more colorful, exciting, and sometimes even nail-bitingly suspenseful elements of the plot, the emotional climax of ""Logan Lucky"" actually occurs during the daughter's serenading her father with an off-key rendition of John Denver's ""Take Me Home, Country Road."" Better yet, the scene works.""Logan Lucky"" depends somewhat on the audience's playing along with its unlikely scenario from the first scene until the picture's enormously satisfying conclusion, but that's easy to do in a picture as eager-to-please and just plain friendly as this one. The delightful last scene seems to leave a door open for a sequel. Soderbergh's ""Ocean's 11"" spawned ""Ocean's 12"" and ""Ocean's 13."" Let's hope that ""Logan Lucky"" can also spread around some of that good fortune.",Logan Lucky

191,ReelLifeReviews,"Good, not great",7,25 August 2017,"Logan Lucky - A southern version of Ocean's Eleven without the clever twists or overall intrigue. While it sticks to the typical heist film formula, the unique characters do differentiate it enough to make it memorable.Daniel Craig looks like he's having a blast with his character. The tongue-in-cheek marketing touted ""and introducing Daniel Craig as Joe Bang,"" and it really does feel like you're seeing the actor for the first time with how completely against type this role is for him.The dynamic between Channing Tatum and his character's daughter is adorable to watch. Their banter felt natural and off the cuff, making me buy into that relationship right away. Hillary Swank is thrown into the movie in the last 20 minutes or so, along with her accompanying storyline. It felt far too late in the game to introduce those two elements, and I ended up not really caring about either.Seth Macfarlane was utterly miscast in his role. He plays an English billionaire with a perm and a caterpillar mustache. While the other actors easily sell their off-kilter characters, Macfarlane seems to be in the middle of a dress rehearsal for a comedy sketch. He begs for laughs in his delivery, rather than delivering any laughs.While this isn't the diamond in the rough I was hoping for, it does find small wins here and there to make it entertaining. It takes plenty of risk with the characters that were created, it just felt too safe in regards to plot.

193,DJKwa,An inversion of the Ocean's films but just as much fun,8,14 August 2017,"A few years ago director Steven Soderbergh made no secret of his waning passion for filmmaking. He announced his intention to retire from feature films following the release of 2013's Behind the Candelabra and cited his desire to pursue other creative interests. Well, it may have taken four years (and a brief stint directing TV's The Knick) to reignite his filmmaking passion, but Soderbergh proves his hand behind the camera is as assured as ever in the rollicking heist caper Logan Lucky.Aptly described by Soderbergh himself as an ""anti-glam version of an Ocean's movie"", Logan Lucky is a return to the style of filmmaking that made his Ocean's trilogy box office hits. The film moves at a neat pace, features a strong ensemble cast and is packed with enough twist and turns to keep things interesting throughout its two hour running time. The story follows the Logan family, brothers Jimmy (Channing Tatum) and Clyde (Adam Driver) and their sister Mellie Logan (Riley Keough), who are known for their family history of bad-luck. After loosing his job at a mine located underneath the Charlotte Motor Speedway, Jimmy plans to pull of an elaborate heist to put the Logan's financial woes behind them and break the family curse. With intricate knowledge of a series of underground tubes that run from the Speedway to a central bank vault filled with millions of dollars, Jimmy sees the perfect opening to rob the vault during a NARSCAR race. To pull it off, he enlists the help of his siblings along with bomb expert Joe Bang (a scene stealing Daniel Craig) and his two brothers, Sam (Brian Gleeson) and Fish Bang (Jack Quaid). The only problem: Joe's in prison. So on top of concocting a plan to steal the cash, they'll need to figure out a way to break Joe out of prison and get him back with no one the wiser. No pressure.It's a zany comedy about unremarkable characters punching well above their weight but through sheer luck managing to pull things off. Half the fun of the film is seeing things not happening to plan but somehow working out in the end. To its credit, the film never treats itself too seriously and invites you to laugh along with the character's mishaps and the farcical parts of the story are frequently the funniest. One gag involving a prison riot and a jab at Game of Thrones writer George R.R. Martin's glacial writing pace is as screwy as it is funny.For the most part, the film moves along at a nice pace. Just like in the Ocean's films, Soderbergh (who edits his own film) employs slick, fast cut editing to keep the heist scenes interesting and involving. He also manages to make good use of an impressive ensemble cast, with the likes of Seth MacFarlane, Katie Holmes, Katherine Waterston and Sebastian Stan all making minor but memorable appearances. And while Adam Driver and Channing Tatum both give impressive performances, the standout is an almost unrecognisable Daniel Craig playing blue-collar criminal Joe Bang. An explosions expert sporting a heavy southern accent and bright blonde hair, he's an anti-glam version of Bond if you will. It's Craig's impeccable comedic timing that will make you wish the Bond films would let him exercise his comedic chops a little bit more.It's only in the last act that the film starts to feel a little played out. The introduction of Hillary Swank as a Special Agent in the last 20 minutes of the film feels a little rushed and ultimately doesn't really go anywhere. Instead, the story continues through a number of false endings, not entirely sure when to bring down the curtain. Overall, as the first feature to draw Soderbergh out of semi-retirement, Logan Lucky is clearly something he wanted to make and his passion comes through in the final product. Produced entirely on his own and without studio interference, Logan Lucky inverts the glamour and opulence of the Ocean's trilogy without loosing the series' trademark quirks and high entertainment value. If Logan Lucky is intended to act as sort of push-back of the Hollywood system and studio meddling, then Soderbergh has succeeded at both proving a point and making you laugh while doing it.",Logan Lucky
194,TigerHeron,Somewhat Silly and Borderline Offensive,6,10 September 2017,"I consider myself a Soderbergh fan. I loved Side Effects, Magic Mike and Sex, Lies and Videotape. I respect him for his movie on Che Guevara. I was very surprised to see this film. It was borderline offensive and although mildly entertaining in parts, did not deserve to be made.Many of the characters are caricatures based on what people in Los Angeles probably think rural people are like. I've been to West Virginia and I don't recall hearing people talk with exaggerated hick/Southern accents. The whole premise of the movie seemed to be ""Look, those people you thought were dumbass hicks can sometimes be smart!"" To say that's condescending is an understatement.The heist was a convoluted, Rube Goldberg-like absurdity. Nothing that happened bore any resemblance to real life. There were two bright spots: Daniel Craig's performance, and a scene featuring the John Denver classic ""Country Roads."" Also Soderbergh sticks in a dig or two about smart phones and social media, and that made the film less stupid.We know that Soderbergh can do better, so why doesn't he?",Logan Lucky

Talking in an exaggerated country accent can exponentially elevate any film's comedic level. That's a big reason why I think O Brother Where Art Thou is such comedic gold. And Hell or High Water wouldn't be the same without the southern setting and chippy dialogue.Anyway, this was a funny movie. It was also a wildly entertaining movie. What if lacked in depth, it made up for in charm. This won't be for everyone, but if you're in the mood for a robbery movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, then watch this one.",Logan Lucky

Cant believe the performance by Daniel Craig in James Bond and now the work in this one was really kind of bad. There is nothing clever about the heist, they take time during a critical point for him to explain what he is doing and writing a formula on the wall. With timing being important in any such movie, these guys can waste more time then waiting at the DMV. The prison scene also is unbelievable, people just carry things out without ever considering that they might even be compensated. No one gets screwed everyone is happy in lala land. These actors who were good in other movies just cant pull anything off in this one. I guess you have to be from the areas mentioned to think this movie is any good.",Logan Lucky

199,iamjacksmoviechannel,Trashy and funny,7,10 August 2017,"""Logan Lucky"" is directed by Steven Soderbergh, written by a woman whose name may in fact be a pseudonym for Steven Soderbergh. Not only is he back from retirement, he's adding to the growing number of female filmmakers. The movie is all about the Logan brothers. Jimmy was supposed to be a big football star but then a leg injury ruined all that. Clyde lost his arm in the war in Iraq. There's a rumor that the whole family might be cursed, one the brothers want to dispel. Jimmy just lost a mining job because of his disability and apparently the brothers used to pull small heist jobs years ago, but now Jimmy has a huge plan for a big score- robbing the Charlotte Motor Speedway. To do it they need the help of Joe Bang, a safe cracker who they happen to need to break out of prison. He's played by Daniel Craig, doing his best Southern accent. Listening to Craig do it is hilarious in and of itself, but Bang is also just a goof in general. Accents in general are most of the best laughs here. This movie is like the Southern answer to ""Fargo"" in that way. Channing Tatum and Adam Driver do a nice job with this stuff too. The other is that this movie is like ""Oceans Hillbillies"". Tatum and Driver aren't the sharpest tools in the shed but they're easy enough to root for. Two brothers here who seem to have been dropped on their heads repeatedly as babies. They steal the show whenever they're on screen. Leading up to the robbery that's what this is- it's just a nice, dumb comedy that's as slickly told as any of Soderbergh's past work. Does it get a bit slow? Yes, but every time there is a meeting of the minds between this dummards, it's pretty funny. Once the robbery jumps into high gear though Soderbergh doesn't pull any stops. From a stubborn prison Warden played by Dwight Yoakum, a very clever explosive device, and one of the best pop culture jokes since ""The Lego Batman Movie"" during a prison riot, Soderbergh knows comedy. He also knows how to fight to make movies his way. Using a 2 point plan, he actually managed to fund this thing mostly by himself because of the currently weak studio system that hardly ever produces anything for adults. Knowing that it's easy to avoid some of the more half-formed characters here, like Sebastian Stan's speedway driver or Seth MacFarlane as his manager. Also this thing seems like it's about to end and then Hillary Swank shows up for 20 mostly useless minutes. It has to many endings. But otherwise this is solid comedy where everyone brings their A-game and makes for a fun, if a bit too long, flick to while away the dog days of summer.

The movie slowly introduces us to the characters and subtly shows us what they up to who they were. It got one of those good old American heist movie vibes mixed with a strong country accent and good dialogues which makes this movie funnier than it should be, and it got a clever finishing.Directer Soderbergh did a great job, there were some plot holes but the movie is funny so we can slide that aside.

201,svikasha,Another Heist Movie but with a Fresh Story that's Chock Full of West Virginian Accents and Humour,8,2 September 2017,"If you are a fan of the iconic 2017 Texas based western ""Hell or High Water"", then this West Virginia-based heist film is sure to please. In ""Logan Lucky"", Channing Tatum and Adam Driver play two distraught and estranged brothers who are down on their lucky and willing to risk everything to rob a vault at a NASCAR racetrack during one of their busiest events. While the setting in this film is definitely new, the usual fare that come with bank heist films can be found throughout this film. But the movie is definitely worth watching as it is sure to deliver more than a few laughs. Despite the tense moments, there is plenty of humor sprinkled throughout the narrative. There are definitely moments to remember such as Daniel Craig, who plays a convict that the two brothers go to for help with their robbery, raising his hat to the American national anthem before putting his hat back on and gleefully exclaiming in a thick country accent, ""let's blow this thang"". Then there is the part where Daniel Craig is writing chemical formulas in chalk on the walls of the vault room. He ends up having to deploy his make shift explosion device twice because as he confesses, ""I twisted the bag too many times"". Perhaps the funniest and darkest moments of comedy in the film happen when one of the brother's prosthetic arm gets sucked in by the vacuum which is being used to suck money from the NASCAR vault. While many heist films try to be gritty, Logan Lucky takes the heartfelt route ending on a positive note. Everybody gets a cut in the end. But the end is open-ended, and the audience is left wondering if the brothers get away or not. Either way, it's not the destination, it's the journey. In this case, Channing Tatum's and Adam Driver's journey is funny enough to warrant watching at least once.",Logan Lucky

204,svorva,Ocean's with ......,7,7 September 2017,"A heist movie with NASCAR, pageants, and pool of pig's feet: sound like a good idea? This is not a rhetorical question. Theoretically I could provide insight, but truthfully, after the analysis I am just going to deliver a verdict that is basically my number out of 10 answer to this question. Yes, there is going to be the rest of the review, but if you're deciding on whether to see Logan Lucky backtrack to sentence one. Your answer is more important than anything I have to offer.Logan Lucky is an Ocean's with rednecks. Normally critics use comparisons of this format out of laziness. Movie is other movie, but with other stuff. Ingenious. I only stoop to this since Logan Lucky bludgeons you over the head with the blunt end of this premise and to ignore this fact is to be negligent. Steven Soderberg might have had déjà vu when he first read the script. An ensemble cast, long set up, the job, failure?, and, with the benefit of a flashback revealing new perspective, the sting. Ocean's and Logan Lucky are not similar because they are both heist films with the same director, it's because they have the same structure. The West Virginia vibe, a façade.Jimmy Logan (Tatum) is latest recipient of the Logan curse. Although content to live simply (without cellphones), his life is threatened when ex-wife (Holmes) wants to move taking their daughter with her. Jimmy is unemployed and desperate. Auspiciously, Jimmy's recent construction job has allowed him intimate knowledge of the Charlotte Motor Speedway, including the subterranean network of pipes transporting cash. Jimmy enlists the help of his younger brother Clyde (Driver), convincing him to get incarcerated so Clyde can conspire with locked up explosives expert Joe Bang (Craig). Together with sister Mellie (Keough) and Joe's bumpkin brothers, the team hopes to break the pair out of prison, pull of the heist of the century, and return the pair to the prison unnoticed. It is a solid plan, but unexpected advances in construction prompts immediate action. The team is forced to give up or tackle the mark during a Memorial Weekend race, the grandest event of the year.So the bluegrass rift is clearly a creation from someone who has only interacted with Boone Country through TV. Our protagonist is a down on his luck ex-football player with a bum leg, recently divorced, has a daughter in beauty pageants, a veteran brother, daisy duke wearing sister, and his favorite song is, of course, Country friggin Road. Clearly an exploration of the Appalachian experience this is not. Silliness abound, still Logan Lucky is a charmer. I say this knowing that there are those who will never fall for country charm.Now let us look at the salespeople. With the possible exception Adam Driver, every actor here is clearly playing a part, but loving every minute. Authenticity is out the window, but the magnetism is everywhere. Hillary Swank shows up in the third act as an FBI agent, the closest thing we get to an antagonists, and even her exaggeratedly stern character is likable. Charming potato Channing Tatum has performed variations of this shtick successfully his whole career. Even country pioneer Dwight Yoakam gets in on the act as a warden maybe possibly perchance inspired by Cool Hand Luke. But Daniel Craig is king. He plays the anti-Bond. Totally unrefined and downright bubbly, he is clearly having more fun than any other cast member, maybe even most audiences. The scene in which this convict hick pauses the robbery to explain the chemistry of his explosions is the best of the movie.I initially referred to the players as salespeople because such slickness aimed at amiability might be occasionally disconcerting, but possibly the only option for the material. The essence of Logan Luck is hockey beyond belief, but never is this pile of clichés painful. If there is anything more to enjoying Logan Lucky then the premise, its understanding the premise is a total fabrication. There is a line describing the events as ""Ocean's 7-11."" These characters might eat at 7-11, but to suggest this is more real than Ocean sophisticated team is ridiculous. This is a totally contrived fantasy world from people who watched too much Beverly Hillbillies. And I love it.",Logan Lucky

207,mt-95256,"Funny, Clever Script Directed by a Returning Expert and Performed to Direction by an Incredible Cast on Top of their Game!",7,27 August 2017,"As the old adage goes, you should never say never – especially if you're a talented and well-respected filmmaker like Steven Soderbergh. Not that we really believed his retirement was for good (or perhaps that's just what we hoped). So we should be doubly happy; firstly because he's back in the director's chair (this being his first movie since 2013); and secondly because his comeback film Logan Lucky is excellent, one which makes us happy that he's back to doing what he does best. In a similar vein to his Ocean's films, but with more style, humour and personality, Logan Lucky is an excellent return for Soderbergh, bringing a mesmerising story, intriguing characters and genuine laughs.Laid off from his job and in much need of cash to help support his daughter, we follow Jimmy Logan (Channing Tatum) as he decides to pull off a heist, robbing a stadium during a NASCAR race. Recruiting his one-armed – or one-handed – brother Clyde (Adam Driver), manic convict and explosion-enthusiast Joe Bang (Daniel Craig) and his two brothers Fish and Sam (Jack Quaid and Brian Gleeson respectively) we seem them plan and pull off an ingenious heist. In a similar manner to Soderbergh's previous heist movies like Ocean's, there's an abundance of clever stuff going on to amuse and impress you from start to finish, with twists and turns aplenty.The story's good, intriguing and, at least on the surface, nice and simple. Yet Soderbergh and mysterious first-time screenwriter Rebecca Blunt keep it interesting and layered by giving us lots of enjoyable detail that make the plan seem all the more intricate and fun to watch. While it could be fun to have seen this play out like the Mission: Impossible films, where you hear the plan step-by-step and then watch everything go according to plan, what Soderbergh achieves is much more effective. Since we don't know exactly what the next stage of the plan is, not only does this raise tension levels, but more than this it seems ingenious and even more impressive when you see it unfold organically, managing to surprise you and keep you invested in the story more than you would be otherwise. Although it may test credulity in how conveniently well the plan goes (more so than the Joker's unlikely convenient plan in The Dark Knight), it's a joy to watch.As captivating as the story is and as entertaining as it may be to watch everything go according to Jimmy's master plan, the structure and pace occasionally seems to struggle to keep up. Whilst for the most part it all goes perfectly and seamlessly; however in the latter half an hour or so, the gear changes dramatically – no longer is it a heist movie, the quasi-epilogue becoming more an investigation. Fortunately the clever twists come and it leaves us on a wonderfully ambiguous cliffhanger, however the last little part doesn't flow quite as easily as the rest of the film that precedes it. This doesn't detract from the movie as a whole though, and is really the only flaw of the film. Other than this, there does seem to be a few sadly missed opportunities, notably with Katherine Waterston's briefly appearing (but potentially interesting) nurse, Hilary Swank's tenacious FBI detective (who certainly deserved more screen-time) and Family Guy's Seth MacFarlane's amusing, but bizarrely pointless, Max Chilblain (good luck spotting this one, it took me a while to recognise him!).Ultimately though the slightly wobbly pace and structure in the latter part of the film and the occasional missed opportunity with some characters are only minor flaws in a bigger picture. This is a film that isn't as focused on the plot as it is the characters. Frequent dialogues aren't necessarily intrinsic and necessary for plot development, but are purely for the brilliant character development – it's this emphasis that makes Logan Lucky the joy it is and more than just another clever heist film. We go on this journey to spend time with the characters; and when they're this well-directed, well- written and well-performed with brilliant pace it's an absolute pleasure. On top of this, it's a wonderful and eclectic cast playing parts we're not exactly used to seeing them in. Behind the thick Southern accent, Tatum's Jimmy has more brains than a lot of Tatum's other characters, quite competent as the leader. Yet more surprising and impressive are Daniel Craig and Adam Driver, the former being very different to his turn as James Bond, and the latter being equally far from his new Star Wars villain, Kylo Ren. This film is a showcase for how talented these actors really are, Driver and Craig in particular battling out to be the show-stealers. Driver's hilariously slow-speaking, but bright one- handed Clyde has great chemistry with Jimmy, while Craig's lunatic, bleach blonde criminal brings the laughs and personality (with an incredibly flawless accent). It's a strong cast performing a strong script excellently and it's a delight to behold.All in all, Logan Lucky is a terrific film and a fitting return for director Steven Soderbergh. Despite the occasional wobbly pacing and structure towards the end and the odd missed opportunity with some potentially great characters, there really is little to fault here. Quick-witted and hilarious script, directed with style by a seasoned professional returning to fine form and performed to perfection by an incredible roster of actors who are on top of their game. We truly are lucky to have a film like Logan Lucky.",Logan Lucky
208,Mohican15,A complete disappointment!,3,5 September 2017,"Now I know what you're thinking: Steven Soderbergh and a comedy crime caper set around a NASCAR race is a perfect combo. Those of you who've seen the Ocean's 11 movies will probably think the same (if you like the Ocean movies)... Well sadly, I am here to tell you now that you are in for a big disappointment. I too, have seen Ocean's 11 and found it both funny AND thrilling and so went into this film with high expectations and was very badly let down. This film is titled as a comedy but I found it about as funny as a young boy saying the word ""vag***"" out loud... Which is what actually what happens. The real problem of this film is the script, courtesy of Rebecca Blunt. I found it one of the most boring and UN-amusing pieces of screen writing I've ever seen. The film is only an hour and fifty-nine minutes but it feels like three hours before the heist actually takes place and that would be OK, IF there was material to keep us entertained until then but there just isn't! Every scene is stretched-out pointlessly long and the dialogue feels it's just there to make the scene longer. What the dialogue DOES do is it drags the scene down and makes it boring and uninteresting. People about anything and everything!After the fresh and fun scenes of Clooney putting his team together in Ocean's 11, you would think it would be the same in Logan Lucky but it's actually just as boring as the rest of the dialogue, just people talking for the sake of talking!Moving on... One thing I will say for Soderbergh is he casts very well and he seems to get the best from his cast. The main characters give very good performances. Tatum and Driver turn in performances TOTALLY different to what they are used to as the dumb, hill billy brothers and actually play the parts very well. Craig too is like you've NEVER seen him before as the bleached blond, crazy-eyed Joe Bang and actually plays the part (and does the accent,for those of you who've seen Cowboys and Aliens) strongly and with real zest! Any more crazy and he'd be a runner up for may be the Joker.Good and convincing from ALL supporting actors: Riley Keough, Jack Quaid and Katie Holmes... However these did little to revive a boring, non-funny and rather convoluted movie! Only at the end was I REMOTELY entertained but still, I was fighting to stay awake... What makes this film such a disappointment is how much potential it had (with the plot) of being a really good and fun film. It makes me wonder if may be in another director and writer's hands (say: Wes Anderson); this could have been everything it promised to be but unfortunately, IT... WAS... NOT!",Logan Lucky

Everyone loves a good ""lovable outcasts pull off the heist"" tale. It tries to tap into the Appalachian quirkiness that made ""Justified"" such an institution. It's almost worth eight bucks just to see if Daniel Craig can act all ""muricann."" And yes, Channing Tatum is actually pretty convincing as a hard-workin' country boy down on his luck. And there's plenty of John Denver references! But in the end, the movie goes nowhere, and in this summer of wretched movies, we're left with another stinker. Almost nothing is funny, and nothing is interesting. The movie goes way too long as they spend the last half-hour ""unraveling the mystery"" while Hilary Swank glowers incessantly. And their attempts to capture some of that Boyd Crowder-esque, crazy hillbilly lifestyle just fall flat every time.What's even more remarkable, is once again, the IMDb user review/metacritic machine has awarded a ridiculously high rating to a very mediocre movie.

Like the Ocean movies this one unfolds at its own pace. It misses the star power and charisma of those movies (Mr.Clooney, Mr.Pitt) and also the evil, greedy villain getting their's in the end (Andy Garcia, Al Pacino). But the movie moves along briskly enough. I enjoyed the one of the final scenes with Mr.Logan and his daughter at the beauty pageant, that was touching.

213,rs403404,"No need to press your luck viewing ""Logan Lucky""",8,3 October 2017,"Logan Lucky tells the story of Jimmy Logan (Channing Tatum), a man down on his luck. He lost his job on a construction site because he has a limp he didn't report when he applied (and doesn't affect his job as a driver). He's divorced with a wife moving away who has full custody of his daughter. He has a brother, Clyde (Adam Driver), a bartender who lost his hand in one of the many wars. It's referred to locally as the Logan Curse. The Logans' simply seem unable to catch a break.Perhaps, there's a chance for their luck to change. Jimmy reveals to Clyde a complex heist plan he's put together that could help their lives exponentially. The plan is so complex it even involves breaking Joe Bang (Daniel Craig) out of prison, getting his help, and getting him back in prison without anyone noticing he's gone.Logan Lucky is a fun and quirky movie. It's filled with characters that could easily be cut from the film and bare no impact on the final product. Seth MacFarlane's Max Chilblain, Katherine Waterston's Sylvia Harrison, and Sebastian Stan's Dayton White could all be cut from the film and the story would play out exactly the same. Their inclusion in this film is baffling.However, much of that is moot since when this movie works, it very entertaining. From the cast, the real highlight is Craig's Joe Bang. A man who appears rather simple and is very crass, yet proves through the movie that is he unusually intelligent. In many ways Tatum's Jimmy Logan has many of these qualities though not nearly as crass.Although, I can spend the rest of the review praising the cast for all doing a great job (even the unnecessary ones), the real star of this film is Steven Soderbergh's direction. Returning to the chair after a very short lived retirement. He shows that his four year break has done nothing to dampen his eye for film.This is that rare film that is equal parts style and substance. There's a clear story here about how we can create our own luck as long as we're willing to take the opportunities when they present themselves. Logan Lucky is hardly a flawless film by any means. It does have a tendency to meander, but never too far off. Two hours with the Logans are two hours you won't regret.",Logan Lucky
214,darcywinchester,Light entertainment movie,7,10 December 2017,"In this Steven Soderbergh (Erin Brockovich, Traffic) directed and Rebecca Blunt (as yet unidentified) written film, Channing Tatum (21 Jump Street, Magic Mike) and Adam Driver (Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Midnight Special) star as brothers Jimmy and Clyde Logan who decide to rob NASCAR after Jimmy gets let go from his job. With help from little sister Mellie (Riley Keough: The Good Doctor, Mad Max: Fury Road) and convicted safe-cracker Joe Bang (Daniel Craig: Skyfall, The Golden Compass) and his brothers Fish (Jack Quaid: The Hunger Games, Vineland) and Sam (Brian Gleeson: Snow White and the Huntsman, Assassin's Creed), they plan to take the money from the takings as the race is run.Attending the Coca Cola 600 is British sports drink salesman Max Chilblain (Seth MacFarlane: A Million Ways to Die in the West, Ted), who had been disrespectful to Clyde about the fact that he had only one arm, despite the fact that it was lost in active service, and his sponsored driver Dayton White (Sebastian Stan: The Covenant, The Martian).Will Jimmy, Clyde and Mellie make it back for Jimmy's daughter Sadie's (Farrah Mackenzie: Please Stand By, Nanny Cam) beauty pageant? The film also stars Katie Holmes (Batman Begins, TVs Dawson's Creek) as Jimmy's ex-wife Bobbie Jo, her new husband Moody (David Denman: 13 Hours, Power Rangers) and sons Dylan (Boden Johnston in his first role) and Levi (Sutton Johnston: TVs Good Girls), as well as Hilary Swank (Million Dollar Baby, P.S. I Love You) as FBI Agent Sarah Grayson.I wasn't at all sure what to expect from this movie, but once I took it for what I assume it was meant to be (light entertainment rather than a serious awards chaser, as Soderbergh himself said in describing the film an ""anti-glam version of an Ocean's movie"") I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Yes, the characters were not very well set up, case in point, for a long time into the movie I thought that Mellie was Jimmy's girlfriend not his little sister and as the main characters wants and needs were not given, you did not feel invested in them as a viewer. There were also a lot of inconsistencies, for example, why would Joe Bang want his brothers to help with the heist when one of them had helped his wife steal his stash whilst he was in prison? So yes the story had a lot of problems, yet the acting was of a good standard (I also loved playing spot the actor too as there were a lot of out of the norm roles for well-known ones) and it was quirky in a good way. Daniel Craig was a stand out and he and Channing were not immediately recognisable, which is a great achievement for such well-known actors. The farcical parts are where the movie lifts itself.Towards the end of the film, when Hilary Swank's FBI Agent Grayson starts to investigate the heist, I felt it was a great way of setting it up for a possible sequel. I hope that this comes to pass.",Logan Lucky

It was the funniest movie I'd seen all 2017, and one of the funniest movies this decade.

216,ashishagupta,Good like a good drinking spirit on a relaxed evening,8,17 November 2017,"There are many kinds of drinks. There are wines, whiskeys, cocktails and beers. Each drink is enjoyed in a different mood. You don't drink single malt in shots like tequila. Same goes for movies. Some movies are action-packed popcorn munching like a robust party with free flowing beers and several loud friends. Some movies are like a mellow evening with a couple of friends, just sitting back and slowly enjoying a fine whiskey.Logan Lucky falls in the latter category. The humor is layered. The script is smart. There are notes of comedy and notes of heist. The finish is satisfying.I chuckled and laughed periodically throughout the movie. It never gets dull. The acting is superb. No character is beyond believable and it seems quite natural.If you want to just sit back and enjoy a movie wash over you with a feel good factor then Logan Lucky is well worth the price of admission. Go see it!",Logan Lucky
217,Danielpotato,"A waste of good actors, it's a passable movie, but it could be much better.",4,8 September 2017,"I recently saw Logan Lucky in theaters, and to tell you the truth I was quite pleased to see this movie. It is a very colorful film, with a very good and nice cinematography and also a very direct film in what it is proposed. It is a heist movie, it does not try to invent the wheel, but It's a nice movie because of the experience of the director, in this genre. But at the end of the day it could have been so much better. Clearly a waste.Much better, nowadays, compared to the extravaganza of Hollywood, where often the biggest and most exaggerated, it is never the best.It's a lot of fun, to see a lot of actors doing a really good job, especially Daniel Craig, Channing Tatum and Adam Driver, they're all great. The actors Hilary Swank, Seth MacFarlane and Sebastian Stan were underutilized. I think it's the director's personal signature, having a great casting of famous actors in his movies. It's just annoying to see pretty good actors like Hilary Swank and Sebastian Stan reduced, little more than a simple cameo. And for what reason the character of Hilary Swank at the end of the film, has to be the romantic couple of Adam Driver's character at his bar when everyone is drinking a drink together.Her character is doing an investigation into the robbery, and one of the suspects was the character of Adam Driver, and in the end of the movie she's going to have a drink with the suspect, what? Because everyone is drinking a drink in a romantic couple, and the Adam Driver's character also needed a woman to drink. What?Some scenes are unnecessary written in the film, just to put the movie with 2 hours on the market.In addition to the unnecessary characters and actors, this film still makes two beautiful sins. First, why the Logan brothers and Daniel Craig's character brothers start a fight when the robbery is ending and the security is investigating the suspected appearance of smoke in the area, are the writers and director only setting a conflict, just to come out into nothing in the next couple of scenes, just to put the movie with (or close to) the unnecessary 2 hours mark, which is the rule of the market, in the duration of films. When you do not have a story to tell, you do not try to create unnecessary scenes, characters or conflicts, just to create them for nothing. Do not waste time on unnecessary things. There are many great movies in the past with less than 2 hours, more time does not always mean more quality.The second sin of this film is the jokes involving Wikipedia and Game of Thrones, yes, I know, the Game of Thrones show is quite a popular series, but the way these jokes are inserted in the film, I feel that these scenes are even out of context . Just one complaint from me.Still with these these problems. I wish I had liked this movie better. There is clear good work done by the director in many areas of the film. Especially for cinematography, and for being a movie that goes right to the point. Impossible is to deny problems and some wrong decisions. But there is no denying, there is a great loss of good actors in this film and some stupid decisions in the movie script.At the end of the day, it's a nice movie, but the poor execution by the director and the poor script just leaves the movie as a weekend fun, only to be seen once, and nothing more. Clearly a poor waste of film.",Logan Lucky
218,MovieSoup,Not good.,4,7 September 2017,"There are some great heist movies out there and considering this is by the oceans 11 guys I thought it would be great. But it just isn't. The characters have no development to them. In a heist movie you are supposed to root for the robbers and want them to succeed. This movie made me not care about their plan and the jokes in it are not thought out properly. Channing Tatum's character was not very believable as both a red neck or a single dad down on his luck. Adam Driver was very boring and stilted with his southern drawl not really impressing anyone. Katie holmes was also in this film but she is a small character. I thank god for this as she just can't act convincingly (watch Batman Begins and you will see why Nolan got someone else to play Rachel in Dark Knight). Overall the 2 of the 3 main characters were boring and the actors were not on their best for this film either because of poor direction or because the actors did not give a sh*t.The only good person in it for me was Daniel Craig. His accent was okay, nothing to get hard over, and some lines he said were at least funny. The little girl in it was okay. Child actors are always going to be rubbish but at least she was convincing. The two redneck brothers were just a stereotype to be laughed at but they again fall flat and are not funny. The ""comedy"" in this ""comedy, crime, drama"" is stilted and boring with very few jokes making me laugh. For instance during the prison riot in there's this big Game Of Thrones reference which falls flat on its face and is boring. It revolves around the books taking a long time to come out..That's it, no set up, no reason, it was just there to be ""random"" and relevant as far as I can tell.I actually made a note of the number of times the audience laughed during the film. Most of the time the audience was silent as the jokes were told except for one or two times like when a red neck says that he is ""really good with computers, all the twitters I know em""No accounting for peoples tastes in comedy I suppose. The plot is simple and effective with the actual ""heist"" bit being okayish. This film was marketed as being from the same guys who did Oceans 11,12 and 13 however the script was written by Rebecca Blunt who to this day has received no other writing credits for any other movies. This is where you have been lied to ladies and gentlemen! I believed going into this film that the plot would be written by the team that wrote Oceans but nope!! The film is not as clever as Oceans 11 for its heist plot. The big reveal at the end is boring, revealing that they just threw a few bin bags full of money in a garbage truck, berried it and then dug it up a couple of months later whilst the FBI was following them?? How did they achieve this anyway??? Surely the FBI would have been keeping tabs on them the entire time and knew they were doing this?! The technical side of things works quite well for this movie as the cut scenes showing the plot of the heist are edited really well. The film did have a flow to it, not being bogged down with pacing issues at all. The colour palette used as well was very efficient and was dark when needed. The sound did not wow me in the least but it was not awful like in some other movies I have seen and was used effectively to create feelings and atmosphere. There was a big John Denver vibe going on which is in keeping with a stereotype that all people from west Virginia love John Denver and know all the words to ""take me home, country road"" which is simply not the case.All in all this film has good parts in it but not enough to warrant a £8.95 theatre ticket. With characters that are flat and comedy that is not funny this film is not the worst I have seen but is missing things that would make it a good movie. I would suggest that you wait for it on DVD or stream it if you really want to see it. Seeing it in the cinema was a bit of a rip off.",Logan Lucky

Lovers of this movie will say the haters aren't smart enough to understand the movie but it's actually the people giving high scores who don't understand just how boring the movie is and don't want to admit it.

It is not the case, as it is soon sidetracked by the action. The ending contains weird plot holes.I recommend this film to fan of the genre.

Okay, here's my problem: loved the whole thing, and was enjoying the wrap up where everyone who took part (knowingly or unknowingly) was being given a share of the loot...but then, at the last second, right when it seemed that everything was FINALLY going right for the two bothers, et al, they show us the FBI agent sitting at the bar, listening to all the key players, checking out Adam Driver's expensive-looking new prosthesis, and pretty much making it clear to us that nope, sorry boys, the Logan Curse _is_ a real thing, and their short-lived happiness is about to come to an abrupt end.Wasn't the fun of this whole movie the idea that these fairly Noble Losers were going to come out on the winning end for once? I don't know, maybe it's just me, but that ending with its apparent portent of doom kind of ruined it for me. So, I will now break out my oft-employed ""Perfect World Positive Spin Magic Rewrite Machine"" on this film, and change the ending, so that while yes, Hillary Swank was there at the bar that night, planning to put our intrepid heroes behind bars for a very long time, she will instead be so totally charmed by the bartender brother that she'll give up the pursuit that very night, opt for love over career advancement, and join the Logan family, with everyone living happily ever after.

I kind of went in expecting a decent time maybe giving the movie a 6 or 7. But I got more than I bargained for here thanks to three awesome performances, a perfectly paced movie as well as a great script. Tatum, Driver, and Craig present three strong performances as southern criminals with generally good intentions. I really enjoyed Driver's one armed dim witted character Clyde Logan. Young Farrah Mackenzie could definitely be a star in the making. However I did not enjoy Seth MacFarlane as Max Chilblain one bit. In my opinion he flat sucked. The story is perfectly paced and really quite engrossing. Starting with the character building, then into the heist plan, then the actual heist, and of course the aftermath. I was never checking my watch nor did my mind ever drift during the movie. I was actually really loving the ride and had one of the best times at the theater all year. I went with a rather large group of 7 or so friends and every once in while I'd look over to see smiles plastered on there faces. I had a big grin through out this film myself. Logan Lucky does have some minor hiccups which include any scene involving MacFarlane, the prison riot scenes, especially an unneeded and silly 2 minutes Game of Thrones bit that felt forced and left me scratching my head.

The cast are great, though their accents are all over the shop...

228,belacane,Loose Threads,6,24 August 2017,"Enjoyable enough for summer viewing, but there were a lot of loose threads in this story! One: Joe Bang says his brothers need to be in on the heist because one of them is a computer expert. Other than one joke that brother makes, there is never any reference made to any computers after this! Were there any computers used for the heist? We didn't notice any. Also, Joe's brothers said they had to be convinced of a 'moral reason' to do this heist because they'd gone straight. Jimmy convinces them. Later, the moral reason is eliminated due to scheduling, and the brothers complain that they no longer have the moral reason...but they go ahead and do their jobs without any more convincing.Reason enough not to trust online sources: several reviews said Jimmy was a newly-unemployed coal miner, which is completely untrue.Anyway, we puzzled over these few odd happenings for a while, and then decided it wasn't worth bothering about.

With a few exceptions, everything works (Max coming to the bar in the beginning seemed a little too random, and Hillary Swank's godawful portrayal of an FBI agent almost spoiled it for me). The characters feel true for the most part, down to the hillbilly arguing when they should be making their getaway. I had not been a fan of Adam Driver, but he turned in a good performance without going over the top (the problem with many quirky films these days).

The plot is fairly simple to begin with, while the characters are presented with more complexity than you would expect from this kind of movie. Adam Driver really steals the show, as the protagonist's veteran brother. Where he could have been a cardboard character, who's only premise was comedic relief, he ends up as charismatic and sympathe.Also all the other actors gives a really convincing southern-state accent throughout the runtime. All of the scenes bring something fun or interesting to the table, which is expected from a film with a simple plot, but this one seems to have a heavy focus on the dialogue - which is also fun and brilliantly executed. The only negative aspects of the movie, might be the clarity of the narrative. It's a small detail in the storytelling that seems to hide where the plot is going. It makes it seem like some of the progression is made up on the get-go, although it's unclear to me if this is intentional.

Its totally perfect for a family movie night, or a get-together!And can we just take a moment to appreciate the southern dialect in this movie?! While most movies requiring a dialect only have a few people who give convincing performances, every single member of this cast was spot on with the specific southern accent (they can vary depending on region, so it is great to see that they all have the same style of southern accents).Actors/actresses like Channing Tatum, Adam Driver, Riley Keough, or Jim O'Heir may not be known for this movie but they (and more actors/actresses) deliver amazing performances!If you watch it for the actors you won't be disappointed, and if your watching it for a great story you also won't be let down!We need more movies like this one.

It wasn't a challenge to get drawn into the plot despite not completely following all steps of the Charlotte speedway heist. The pace of the plot was very punchy and did keep me consistently entertained and I don't mean trashy entertainment I mean high nutrition well shot, written and cast, entertainment! I, like so many, am guilty of unconsciously assuming Daniel Craig's repertoire to be pure 100% undiluted, Bond. So I was magnificently satisfied with Craig's character 'Joe Bang' as the actor has a strong comedic instinct and physicality about him. I was weirdly energised by Craig's portrayal of this eccentric bomb virtuoso, and I hope the world will be graced with more Craig comedies. I thought that all the characters worked tremendously well together like a good recipe. Tatum played the flawed yet doting and determined dad with real conviction and had a really endearing energy with his on screen daughter. Mellie, the sister was also a really great character! She had all of your classic visual Hollywood signifiers of a ditsy female with her transparent tops and short skirts except FINALLY this wasn't exploited by the film and the character herself was sharp and savvy and had a respected authority in the film. I thought Lucky Logan had a great sense of visual narrative in details like the painted cockroaches, jelly beans in the bomb and the repeat appearances of Joe Bangs favourite; two hard boiled eggs and salt. There was some really well composed shots particularly ones including the strangely artistic stripy prison onesies. I thought many steps of the Heist where very comic and creative and kept me laughing and engrossed throughout.",Logan Lucky

They look for help from Daniel Craig who is the stand out in this movie, he is funny, charismatic and steals every scene he is in. All the performances are great and everybody brings their A game.This movie definitely uses the 3 act technique, I won't spoil anything but when you see the movie you will get it. The great things are definitely the performances of everybody and how they set up the heist is very interesting. There are some issues with the movie like some scenes just feel pointless and because of that they are a little boring. Also there is a subplot with Chaning Tatums daughter and it is not as interesting as the rest of the movie.Logan Lucky is definitely a very decent movie and I would definitely recommend to see it. The most interesting thing with this movie is that the director Steven Soderbergh is doing the marketing all out of his own pocket, there is no big studio supporting the film. This is a great thing in my opinion and I hope the movie get's his budget back so other directors will do this and they can completely use their own vision without studios trying to interfere with the project.

Add Steven Soderbergh and first-time screenwriter Rebecca Blunt to that mix and you have ""Logan Lucky"". Jimmy Logan (Channing Tatum) is let go from his job working underground construction at the Speedway and is down on his luck. Between supporting his bartender brother, Clyde (Adam Driver), dealing with his overbearing sister, Mellie (Riley Keough), a nagging ex-wife in Bobbie Jo (Katie Holmes), and a daughter preparing for a Little Miss West Virginia pageant in Sadie (Farrah Mackenzie). Jimmy and Clyde end up working with Joe Bang (Daniel Craig), hatching a plan to break him out of prison, steal the money from the vault, and then break him back in before anyone realizes he is gone.Seeing all of these great actors playing West Virginians is worth the price of admission ALONE. (Add to that Seth McFarlane working a strange form of Australian accent as an energy drink magnate and NASCAR owner, and that mix gets even more fun.) However, this fact by itself cannot be expected to carry a two-hour runtime that ""Logan Lucky"" brings with it, and that is where my issue with it comes into play. There are many moments where I found myself laughing out loud by the complete absurdity of what was going on, but a chunk of the third act does tend to get a bit loose before everything comes together for a strong finish. The odd thing about it, though, is that I don't feel like they could have trimmed that third act up to make it any more enjoyable. It's like it teetered on completely spinning out of control but kept things just on this side of that line. This great cast does a wonderful job in filling those gaps, which is probably why I liked the cut where it stood, but I could see some of the detractors' opinions here. Given the simplicity of its characters (on purpose), it is surprisingly a bit more complex than it has to be (especially as it all unfolds), but it is not unrealistic to match the plan up to its principals. There is also Hilary Swank as the FBI agent assigned to the case, but I felt that her character was a bit rushed due to the amount of time it took to get through the caper itself, but again, I don't know that this could have been cut differently to get there quicker.The best way to frame ""Logan Lucky"" using the tried-and-true Hollywood formula is this: It's ""Oceans Eleven"" meets ""The Apple Dumpling Gang"" meets ""Little Miss Sunshine"" with a dash of ""My Name Is Earl"".

The things I liked about this movie was the country setup as for me it was a new thing and they were sort of trying to bring up a poor state(no offense) in lime light, second thing was acting by Daniel Craig and Riley Keough, honestly I haven't head Daniel Craig with an so deep American accent and he pulls it of great but sometimes it feels as if its makeup, about Riley Keough I didn't except she could do such genre of acting and she did an exceptional job. Channing Tatum and Adam Driver were exceptional too, as they can pull off everything, so no comment on them. The other thing great about this movie was editing and ""character balance"" everyone was given equal time depending upon their roles. Rest would be nit-picking about this movie but well here it is Cinematography was exceptional but it fell short when character oriented, the science didn't suit well to this movie and I didn't understood how Hilary Swank's character played out.

239,dermobreen,They let the chains off Daniel Craig,7,15 September 2017,"I know I'm late to the party with this review. While it is still in cinemas, I want to urge you to go and see it.Steven Soderbergh returns to the silver screen with Logan Lucky. Soderbergh previously brought us Ocean's Eleven, Ocean's Twelve and Ocean's Thirteen. Next year he will produce Ocean's Eight. It is without doubt that Soderbergh knows how to film a crime caper filled with complex plotting, serious human moments, dead-pan humour and a significant twist at the end.The plot is straight-forward. Two brothers (played by a charming Channing Tatum and a brilliantly dead-pan Adam Driver) attempt to pull off a heist during a NASCAR race in North Carolina. Along the way they enlist the help of an explosives expert, appropriately names Joe Bang (played by Daniel Craig, who clearly has been let loose and chews up the scenery with gusto).Set in the heart of Trump-land (it is a thing you know) and close to recent racial protests in Charlottesville, this caper is Ocean's Eleven in a hillbilly world. Are there stereotypes? Yes. Are there southern tropes? Yes. Does it take itself seriously? No.The film is well put together based on the screenplay by Rebecca Blunt (As of July 2017, suspected to be a fictitious person; a pseudonym for an, as yet, unidentified person. The real person exchanged emails with Channing Tatum, Adam Driver and Daniel Craig, cast members of Logan Lucky (2017), during filming. They believed she resided in the UK).To invoke a litotes, the film is not without it's faults but where it succeeds is in the performances of this stellar cast. They clearly had fun. The late introduction of Hillary Swank as an FBI agent assigned to investigate our villains/heroes is a masterpiece of casting and Swank makes the most of her limited screen time.Too much analysis will spoil what is a thoroughly silly, yet enjoyable film.

241,laszlo-05700,A movie that hurts nobody,8,29 January 2018,"NASCAR, prison, family, robbery, rednecks, State of Virginia, USA. First seeing the headlines made me think there's no way I'm going to like this movie. But was I wrong!
Of course, Steven Soderbergh is a very experienced man in this genre - altough I'm not a fan of the Ocean's movies, it was him who gave a strong basis making sure Logan Lucky can't fall in the ""bad"" category of the reviews. But it wasn't the director, who made the movie shine. There's a scriptwriter by the name Rebecca Blunt, whom nobody seems to know anything about (could be a trick to boost ticket sales). Whether she exists or not - the story is the main strength of this movie. Not absolutely original, but has very fine taste in joining together the main storyline and scenes with little drops of comedy (almost dramedy) elements. Then there is a family side-story which in the beginning I though could easily ruin the whole show, since it's very risky choice for a heist movie - but it didn't! It even adds a little personal touch to the movie - without offending anybody. A rare virtue among family movies!
As for the cast there's no much surprise. When the NASCAR cameo stars appear naturally it's a bit amateurish, but in the end it didn't felt like it was a NASCAR themed movie - it's really just a background for the more important actors. Daniel Craig seemed sensational as always - giving an almost Vinnie Jones-style British bad guy (was suprised he didn't beat up anyone) while acknowledging that his actual role is to make a parody out of that. Adam Driver played a very authentic one handed bartender-bro and the rest of the main characters were OK as well.
For the bad parts: this superstitious unlucky family-hex seemed a bit out of context, it only related to the title, but as we can't go too deeply into the characters past it doesn't have much meaning to the viewer. The prison scenes seemed so silly that no wonder they ended up as more of a fun-source rather than actually serious part of the action. The lack of budget shows here and there, but all in all Logan Lucky is probably the strongest contender for a fictional ""Suprise movie of 2017"" award. I'm really happy when a relatively new production company succeeds with a good movie against the big Hollywood studios, but here it is: I can recommend this movie to anybody who wants to see such phenomenon.",Logan Lucky

Despite borrowing lots of plot points from Ocean's 11 through 14 (or is it 19 now?), this version is witty in a way that fits both NASCAR and the Mountaineer State.Solid performances all around, especially from Ms Swank and an amazingly Southern-sounding Mr Craig.The only negative? I could see the difference between a movie made with $30 million in the budget, and one with $85 million.Nice touch to blow up internet to some of the concession stands: more cash receipts.",Logan Lucky
244,samhendersonthemovieman,An entertainingly funny heist.,9,30 August 2020,"The reason I wanted to watch Logan Lucky was because it had a pretty interesting cast like Daniel Craig, Adam Driver, Sebastian Stan, and Katie Holmes. Without watching the trailer, I thought it was going to be an action movie, but I was surprised that, when I first watched it, it turned out to be a heist comedy. I was expecting Daniel Craig to be the main character, but I was surprised that it turns out that Channing Tatum and Adam Driver were the main actors and Daniel Craig was one of the supporting actors. Anyways, The humor is laugh-out-loud funny and quirky at the same time. The movie itself is Ocean's Eleven meets O Brother, Where Art Thou?. The acting from the cast is very well done. Like Ocean's Eleven, Logan Lucky had a very interesting twist at the end of the heist (or movie). The directing from Steven Soderbergh, who also done the Ocean's trilogy, is really stylish and the soundtrack is also very entertaining. What also surprised me is Daniel Craig had a Southern accent in the movie, which was quite hilarious. Logan Lucky is an entertainingly fun movie and worth watching for heist movie fans.",Logan Lucky

It is a an attempt of making a funny and exciting heist movie that in fact is neither.The movie is not bad played by the actors*. Not even bad directed by Steven Söderberg - who generally has a talent of making movies with a realistic edge due to his way of shooting scenes with quiet sequences that speak for themselves - Its just that in this case it is a funny mixture of Söderbergs stile and mixed with humor and action scenes that does not match with the genre.*However: Is Adam driver not a wrong cast to play Jimmys one armed brother?Maybe Söderberg should look towards Guy Ritchies brilliant movie Snatch (maybe he did?) - Now there is a mixture that comes out both funny, exciting and brilliant even.But you know - This movie tends to either impress or the opposite.

Logan Lucky is full of interesting characters. Channing Tatum and Adam Driver make oddball, yet endearing brothers. Daniel Craig is a hoot in spite of some questionable accent slips. But the film gives them a not entirely realized burglary scheme. It is all too convenient and complex at the same time. I also didn't much care for the daughter being in a beauty pageant. Soderbergh seems to treat her interest in this as healthy thing, and just from how unseeingly these things really are as depicted on TLC and the like, it felt wrong in a film that is irreverent.

Great movie.",Logan Lucky
254,fredlondi,"A meandering, frustrating, tone-deaf mess (SPOILER)",1,20 August 2017,"**SPOILERS**I didn't have high expectations for this movie. I found the ""Oceans 11"" series to be nothing more than pretentious vanity projects where A- list celebs get paid millions to portray ""the cool guy who does X"" instead of using their talents to make an entertaining film. It's like filming some guy's vacation (a la Adam Sandler).But when I heard about this film's subversion of that series with imperfect characters and setting, I was intrigued. It was a mistake. I was not rewarded for going against my instincts.First of all, there's absolutely no clear motivation for any of the film's actions to be taking place. Channing Tatum is fired for cause by someone not even affiliated with the race track. He's a veteran, yes, but an ex-con with an untrustworthy streak to him, even claiming to be ""a Unabomber type."" We have absolutely no reason to side with him, or his quest. One of the other characters even calls him on this, saying ""what has NASCAR done to you?"" then offers no response. There's also no motivation among the rest of the cast. Aside from his brother, no one has any reason to help him - from Daniel Craig, who's just a couple months from getting out of prison, to the other prisoners who didn't even meet Tatum. Both are asked to assume tremendous risks for very little reward - a reward which, for the most part, is given back to the track. Likewise, Tatum has no reason to double-cross his crew, including the two slack-jawed comic relief characters who did most of the work. Tatum's chicanery was not at all endearing. I couldn't wait for the FBI to barge down his door at the very end.The film tries way too hard to make Channing Tatum's character seem more clever than he appears with a last-minute ""fake out"" that reveals he's actually some kind of mastermind who planned an elaborate double-cross on his fellow criminals. There was absolutely no set-up to this reveal - in fact, the film goes out of its way to point out how unlucky Tatum and his brother are. This made clear that such a thing should not have been possible, and no event took place to indicate it could happen. Lazy writing. This movie commits the cardinal sin of feeling like a sequel to a film that never existed. We're assumed to know about the ""Logan Curse,"" and other events we are told about instead of shown.Other examples of sloppy writing abound. Two critical plot points that allow the heist to succeed are (1) that the warden of the local prison doesn't let anyone know about anything that happens at his prison, and (2) that the accountants at the Charlotte Motor Speedway keep really sloppy records of their cash input. Both of these facts are revealed after the fact, rather than built up beforehand. Yet the film backtracks near the end, making it seem like Tatum knew of these weaknesses and was able to take advantage.This is an anemic, disjointed film, filled with pregnant pauses for laugh breaks for moments that aren't funny. Topping the list was an excruciatingly long scene that makes dated references to ""Game of Thrones."" Other jokes have no payoff. When Channing Tatum is told to bring his daughter to a tanning parlor, then takes a shortcut by using a paint sprayer loaded with spray-on tan, nothing comes of it. The mother doesn't notice, and moves along with taking her to a pageant. Seth MacFarlane is terrible in this, but since that's not all that surprising, I can hardly fault the film for that.That said, there are moments of unintentional hilarity. For example, the same exact establishing shot of the ""West Virginia"" road sign was used so much that it felt like a joke. The last time was on a dark night where you could only see its outline.However, this remarkable film even manages to ruin these moments. Hillary Swank's sudden appearance in the third act drags the film another 20 minutes past its natural conclusion. Her stoic performance as an FBI agent is so wooden that it's actually quite funny. Her summary of the movie's events as she speaks with her fellow agents was the only time I laughed. But even this is screwed up at the very end, where it's implied that Swank had some role in the robbery. It's also implied well after the fact that a health- conscious race car driver, featured in another of the film's too many subplots, had a role as well. This gave the film a distinct ""first draft"" feel to it, as if it script writer thought of it in the final few paragraphs.Also, who ever heard of a heist film about racing - or at least a race track - without a car chase? I didn't until I saw this. There's a wonderful set-up where a side character is mocked for not knowing how to drive stick, so he gets a manual Mustang. The car is used in the heist, which involves a one-armed man. Nothing comes of this, however, as yet another side-character with no personality drives the car to the heist without a single obstacle. We're even told not to get our hopes up - there aren't any cops there to chase them. Way to go, movie.Thank goodness there were some surprising cameos from NASCAR drivers in the second act, otherwise those two hours would have been a complete waste. Both movie fans and racing fans will leave the theater equally disappointed.",Logan Lucky
255,karinafaolin,Best Comedy I've Seen in 10 Years,10,4 September 2017,"I saw this movie at random(because I go to the movies for the sake of going to the movies, so I watch pretty much everything). That being said, I've seen at least 1/4 of the movies that have come out in theatres since 2010, and this was the best comedy I've seen in the last 10 years. Most comedies lately rely on soft core sex scenes and smoking weed for humor, which gets boring when that's every comedy movie. (Don't get me wrong, that can be funny, but it's just been so overdone). Anyway, I laughed continuously through this movie.",Logan Lucky
256,jerrycoliver,I mean...it's not the worst heist movie ever,5,21 September 2017,"I have to give it a 5, because honestly, my wife loved it, so there is something there. It's not a ""thinker"", and it's not clever. I think the best way to describe it is a good movie you can watch while doing something else.My biggest problems with the movie are below, but before that, the acting was good and there were some lines that were very good and jokes that totally landed. I honestly didn't realize it was a Steven Soderberg movie until the credits at the end. The lighting was good, consistent. The editing, well I'm not sure they had to work with and what the director/producer wanted, but I felt like it could have been better. Overall, I feel like the cast and crew were committed and gave their best.The downers are mostly script related though there were some very poor directing choices (which is funny, because I said the same thing about the Ocean's movies, but they could get away with it because the script and performances were untouchable.)1. There is so much talk about the area and the geography it became very clear 5 minutes in that the writer has never been to the area, they just looked it up on a map. Case in point, if this all happened in real life, it would be nearly a 5 hour drive to and from WV to Charlotte each time.2. I had no connection with the characters. I just didn't care because they weren't set up, their needs/wants.Why did Jimmy need to rob a bank in the first place? He didn't need that much money to move to Lynchburg (I mean if he's commuting 5 hours for a job in Charlotte, wouldn't a 4 hour drive to Lynchburg be the same or better)? Does he have a history of crime or robbing banks?What motivated the idea in the first place? (Had the scene where he saved the worker's life when he was buried in the tunnel, been the opening scene (before credits) it wouldn't have come out of the blue and felt more natural.A good example of not setting up characters, is that it was a good 1/2 hour into the movie before I realized that Milly was Jimmy's sister, not his girlfriend.3. Why did his brother go along with him? Why was Joe Bang interested? Why would Joe Bang want his brothers involved when one of them had helped his wife steal Joe's savings? Why did Joe even want anyone else involved especially his brothers who opened their mouths about his savings?Joe and his brothers never even had good chemistry and only a few minutes on screen together.4. Adam Driver never had to go to prison in the first place...so why? If he didn't there was no need for the brothers anyway.5. The story with the nurse was so weak...it really didn't need to be in there.6. The FBI characters where introduced so late into the story it is just distracting. You have to introduce the main characters in the first act you can't pull them into the story that far in.7. What was the point of giving the money back? The only people they screwed over were the Bang Brothers. But there never felt like there was any animosity between the Logans and Bangs, and there was never a suggestion the Bangs were even upset at the end when they got screwed over...so why?8. Why did a multi-millionaire walk into a crappy bar in WV at the start of the movie? Couldn't Jimmy and his brother crossed paths with him in a more realistic setting like, the motor speedway that Jimmy was working at?9. I didn't need the back story to the race car driver, that just ate up time and wasn't funny.10. Why give that much money to the prison at the end but completely screw over the Bang brother who did more work? Why give the banker with the cake get money?I was just kind of shocked this script was bought. The writer is apparently a pen name, so I'm assuming someone very famous who is likely an actor in the movie was the writer and that's probably the only reason it was picked up.But after all that, most people don't get that obsessed with the story like I do (ie, my wife) and if you're looking for something fun, yeah I don't think you can go wrong with the movie...it could have been funnier, it could have been more clever, but it wasn't a horrible movie, just some very poor writing.",Logan Lucky
257,UrsusProblemus,Another soulless US product,3,24 March 2021,"While never boring, the movie lacks anything resembling a heart.

258,SandyAren,Typical Popcorn Movie. Not that bad for killing your time.,5,15 May 2018,"The scenes felt heavy handed and went on too long in trying to make sure that everyone watching would understand what the scene was trying to say. Than was the biggest disadvantage. But at first I had expected that the working-class characters would fall into their designated stereotypes and we'd chug along to an easily-expected finish. Not so much. Actually, the characters were nicely filled out, there were stereotypes but not the ones I expected. Except Daniel, his character was filled with stereotypes. And who the hell did his hair cut? He looks like he is over 60.In general, it's a zany comedy about unremarkable characters punching well above their weight but through sheer luck managing to pull things off. In the last act that the film starts to feel a little played out. The introduction of Hillary Swank as a Special Agent in the last 20 minutes of the film feels a little rushed and ultimately doesn't really go anywhere. Instead, the story continues through a number of false endings, not entirely sure when to bring down the curtain. Overall, as the first feature to draw Soderbergh out of semi-retirement, Logan Lucky is clearly something he wanted to make and his passion comes through in the final product. Produced entirely on his own and without studio interference, Logan Lucky inverts the glamour and opulence of the Ocean's trilogy, but with losing the series' trademark quirks and high entertainment value.

The bulk of the cast does well despite this, especially Adam Driver; he steals every scene he's in.The direction and cinematography were both top notch, in contrast with the editing, which was very sub par.

It is still mystery to me that why this film wasn't more popular upon its release (although it didn't quite bomb, but it wasn't some huge box-office success either) or, why it haven't gain wider recognition later. 'Logan Lucky' lacks the glamour or technology from Soderbergh's own 'Ocean trilogy' or, some other high octane heist movies. The smart screenplay brings high octane heist into much simpler territories, with couple of simple (but not simple minded or stupid) guys pulling off the robbery of the racetrack. The whole ensemble cast pulls off wonderful characters that are all likeable into some degree, and it is very easy to feel for them. Screenplay is smartly written and twisty enough, and although it demands some suspense of disbelief, one can't argue that is is one of the well written heist movies in history of filmmaking. Add Steven Soderbergh's non-flashy, but detail oriented directing style, and you get highly entertaining, but quite subtle comedy.

261,lowgunberry13,"Red-Neck ""Ocean's Eleven""",9,23 November 2017,"LOGAN LUCKY REVIEW AChanning Tatum is Jimmy Logan, a has been football star from a small town in West Virginia, his ambitions of joining the NFL was cut short by a knee injury. He's separated and was just laid off. In fact, it seems that everyone in the Logan family is cursed. So, to change that, Jimmy teams up with his one handed brother Clyde (Adam Driver) who is really over the top with his accent, sister Mellie (Riley Keough) and professional criminal Joe Bang (Daniel Craig) this guy is hilarious, almost seems odd seeing him out side of 007 . The players are gathered together in an effort to steal all the money from Charlotte Motor Speedway during the annual Coca Cola 600 NASCAR race.That set-up would make ""Logan Lucky"" a heist film; a genre Soderbergh (""Ocean's trilogy"") is certainly familiar with. But it also attempts to be mockery/comedy, playing off Southern stereotypes of beer-drinking rednecks and ""Toddlers and Tiaras"" pageants. Soderbergh's trademark directing style is on full display: tons of dialogue which reminds me somewhat of films by the Coen brothers this may be the most Coen- esque of Soderbergh's films, in its mishmash of giddy story-line flair and the amusement in regional and local idiosyncrasies.One interesting thing for racing fans: NASCAR participated fully with production. Scenes were shot at Charlotte Motor Speedway, the racing footage is real and drivers Carl Edwards, Kyle Busch, Brad Keselowski and Joey Logano all have cameos. Thankfully there is no overabundance of left turns here.This has been coined as a red-neck ""Ocean's Eleven"" and it's a very fun and entertaining film. As for the real actors, the star-studded cast isn't the brightest tools in the shed and there are quite a few mishaps. Sebastian Stan (Bucky in the Marvel Universe) plays a fictitious NASCAR driver, and Seth MacFarlane is a wreck as a wacky corporate sponsor. Then, just when you think the finish line is near, Oscar winner Hilary Swank cruises in as FBI agent looking to solve the case, unfortunately her character sticks out like a sore thumb she's very stale. One rather odd fact apparently the film's credited screenwriter, Rebecca Blunt, may not be an actual person. IMDb claims that either Soderbergh himself, his wife Jules Asner wrote the script. Emails were said to be going back and forth from cast members to an unknown discussing this.Rated PG-13 for language and some crude commentsFemale characters wear somewhat revealing outfits in some scenes. 1- F bomb and several sexual comments made 1 rather graphic one coming from a child.

The cast is fantastic but without standouts because their performances were equally brilliant and thanks to flawless writing, it was integral to the film that they all play off each other. The actors seemed to be acting in unison, much like the team of unpolished bandits they were portraying in the film. While Logan Lucky scores some solid laughs, it is less a mainstream cookie-cutter comedy caper and more a slick heist picture throwback. Everything about this movie works with the exception of the obviously forced casting of Seth MacFarlane and Hilary Swank, which was clearly done to add a few more household names to the roster and get asses in the seats.

276,subteacher-imdb,More NASCAR fans need to see this!,9,14 August 2020,"I went into this movie mostly because it involved one of my favorite sports and featured many driver cameos. It seemed a bit suspicious that the sport and its fans aren't still talking about it as much as movies like Talladega Nights or Days of Thunder. However, after watching it, I can understand why, but it's not what you think.Logan Lucky is a heist movie. A lot of reviewers chalk it up as ""Ocean's Eleven"" meets ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" Unlike the aforementioned NASCAR movies, the sport isn't the focal point of the movie. It merely provides the setting. The movie also treats the sport with a lot of dignity and respect which I love. The cameos are absolutely amazing, and will catch you by surprise if you're a fan.The main characters are quirky, but surprisingly relatable. The humor may not be for everyone, but there's many LOL moments that everyone can appreciate. The writing is very smart. The soundtrack is masterfully put together. The filmography is up there with some of the best.This movie will become a cult classic in a similar vein that ""The Big Lebowski"" has. Whether you're a NASCAR fan or not, I think you'll love this movie. That said, if you are a fan of the sport, all I can say is where have you been?? Go watch it!",Logan Lucky

279,Deb-ABQ,Well Below Average,3,19 February 2018,The only time I bother to review movies is when the info on IMDB steered me wrong. This is one of those times. When I went to watch this movie it had a 7.1 rating. I don't know why. Average caper film with kind of flimsy storyline. A lot of it doesn't make sense. It is meant to be tongue-in-cheek but that doesn't mean you don't need a solid storyline.,Logan Lucky
280,jyoti1020,I loved the light hearted fun movie,10,20 August 2017,"I liked it even more after reading Steven Soderbergh's interview about cutting out big studios from the profits and sharing it with the crew instead. Good for him! ""The film is also an answer to questions he's been grappling with his whole career: What if you could make a movie that cut out studios entirely, allowing the filmmaker to do as he or she pleased? What if infamously shady studio accounting could be reduced to something as simple as a password-protected website, where everyone involved with the film— from the producers to the costume designer to Adam Driver— could simply log on and see how much money the film had made, and what percentage of that money was theirs?""",Logan Lucky
281,cmoreland-50752,Individual scenes great!.. but overall story convoluted,6,28 March 2020,"With a great cast and a fun redneck setting, this movie is clever and funny within the individual scenes. However, the way that all of the separate scenes are pieced together to form this heist is pretty sloppy. It doesn't give enough details about the heist to be convincing, and although some of schenanigans are, at times, ridiculous enough to be laughed off, it sometimes gets to the point where it just feels like lazy writing. Because of the poor editing the pulling off of the heist becomes confusing, and just when the movie feel like it should reach a ""climax,"" your left with missing information and then the film continues for another 30 minutes trying to...explain everything..? But really doesn't get that job done either.

I enjoy a good laugh but this is too ridiculous for words.A bunch of low achievers first of all waltz into a prison and borrow one of the inmates so that he can take part in a robbery, Somehow they know they can just take a hand wash machine off the wall in the toilets, walk through a few passage ways and get out the other end. They then have access to two panels that fit under a prison van which they somehow fix themselves into, we don't get to see how this bit of magic is achieved and they let themselves out again when the van is outside.They do this in order to rob a bank vault underground. It was at this point and I honestly don't know how I got this far that I had to stop watching for my own sanity.

291,iromashchenko,Ocean Lucky,9,10 September 2017,"Steven Soderbergh has returned to big cinema with a new heist movie. Unlike his previous Ocean's movie franchise, this time everything is slightly less glamorous. Instead of Las Vegas we have Charlotteville, instead of a casino we see Charlotte Motor Speedway. While the location does not look like a world-wide known, the actors in a movie may be easily recognized by anyone nowadays. Deniel Craig will still play James Bond, Channing Tatum will soon be seen in the new Kingsman, and Adam Driver will appear again in the Star Wars franchise. However, here they are all far being heroes (at least not at the first sight), they have all lost something in the past and will probably do it again. They are all simple, straightforward, and constantly get into troubles. In this movie Soderbergh does not seem to make some over-effort, but presents a product of good quality. This is a typical Soderbergh movie both build under the successful recipe of Ocean's Eleven and simultaneously playing with some genre clichés. Of course, since the release of Ocean's Eleven Soderbergh has experimented a lot, both on the big screen and on TV (the Knick), and his style has changed somehow. Still, if you like his movies you will probably enjoy this one as well.",Logan Lucky
292,CokenaSmile,Why the Yankee hate? Or city hate? Or can't drive a 5-speed hate?,9,10 February 2019,"This was brilliant, y'all, so I really don't understand the vitriol.Soderbergh's brilliance is subtle sometimes, so I understand that those who might be used to being spoon-fed their jokes would feel frustrated. Seriously, we are in the middle of a multi-year drought for real comedy at the cinema, so if people aren't watching cinema from years beyond their existence, they probably don't know funny when they see it on the silver screen. Edgar Wright is our oasis in this comedy-free desert, and now Soderbergh gives us a quiet little gem to go with Wright's work.These aren't stereotypes - I grew up among people who could easily jump into the film and not have to act. No moral outrage needed, no haughty assertions that he's making fun of rednecks. Soderbergh microscopes his characters in their milieu - look at how he nailed the Midwestern vibe in THE INFORMANT. He figures out the patois and rhythms of his characters and gets it right.The jokes are subtle - ""Which part of Florida?"" You have to have some Southern culture on board to appreciate that one and the others that slide right by if you're not paying attention.Some have complained about the pace, and I think that goes back to today's spoon-fed cinema. Earlier today I re-watched THE WILD BUNCH for the 10,000th time, and the entire beginning + title sequence takes at least as long as this film takes to arrive at its first explosion.Since the 90s, movies have become more and more insecure about holding your attention, so they attempt premature movie-gasm instead of sustained film-play that builds to glorious capitulation. People need to put down their phones, pay attention, and learn to enjoy a story that doesn't pop off in the first five minutes. It's actually BETTER if you put some work into earning your movie-gasm.The acting was spot-on. Dwight as the Warden was sublime. Brits and Australians tend to deliver Southern accents in a way that doesn't induce suicide among Southerners, and Craig does well here as a smart nutcase (yeah, we had a few of those in my neck of the woods growing up, too). Channing very correctly played the boring high school football player I'm so glad I didn't marry back home. That's 100% authentic for range of emotion.Any studio that dumps a film to theaters in August should probably not be allowed to release films, period. Save it for Labor Day or drop it on the 4th and hope that it has legs to last until Labor Day. An early August release is film manslaughter, but we've enjoyed some really great films that survived that phenomenon - IN BRUGES was way too smart for its Feb release years ago. That's a studio marketing issue - they don't know what to do with films that don't all look and sound the same, so they get the August slot. That couldn't have helped the box office.The release date, plus the phenomenon of MoviePass (because M-Passers don't necessarily seek specific cinema, they just show up and expect to be Judd-Nelson'd for anything labeled ""comedy""), plus the general absence of true comedy in American cinema to educate young film-goers in the arts of comedy have created a backlash against films like this one that are smart and funny and so on the nose about people and human behavior.And most of all, I have to wonder if those disappointed in the film probably felt the acute absence of being pandered to?Everything in our media-rich society panders like a geisha, lest your attention be diverted elsewhere. Good grief, even Amazon tried to get me to watch something else before I was done watching credits on this film. Well, guess what, people - not everything is about YOU. Go live in someone else's world for a while, and you will be shocked to discover that you're having as much fun as the rest of us who have put down our phones, waited patiently for a story, and successfully escaped the geisha.",Logan Lucky

Great job everyone!",Logan Lucky
295,racingfilmreviews,"Put bluntly, this is a heist film",6,5 March 2021,"Released in 2017 and now available on Netflix 'Logan Lucky' probably boasts the most jaw dropping star studded cast of any racing film ever made. Let's start at the top, we have Riley Keough, granddaughter of Elvis. Hillary Swank who has two best actress Oscars. Katie Holmes, Katie if you are reading this, I have always loved you more than Tom ever did. The wonderful Katherine Waterson who has less prominent role but shows once again that she is destined for bigger things. We get former U.S. Marine Adam Driver who was awesome in films like Star Wars, BlacKkKlansmen and let's face it, every racing film needs a good Driver. The list goes on, there is also Channing Tatum, Daniel Craig and Seth MacFarlane. Country music singer / songwriter and double Grammy winner Dwight Yoakam also has a major role. Then there is a host of cameos from NASCAR drivers; Carl Edwards, Kyle Busch, Brad Keselowski, Joey Logano, Kyle Larson and Ryan Blaney.Needless to say, all this star talent cost a lot of money resulting in a budget of $39 million, which is actually still less than Days of Thunder at $55 million 27 years earlier. Where the film may have saved some money was in the writing which was adapted from a screenplay by the relatively unknown Rebecca Blunt. The screenplay was so enticing the prospect of making the film coaxed director Steven Soderbergh out of retirement at the age of 54. The reason why Soderbergh was able to retire so young initially was he did quite well out of some films he made such as Erin Brokovich, Traffic, Oceans 11, 12 and 13. He has a filmography catalogue that as at 2018 had pulled in over $2 billion dollars.A common measure of film success is how it has done at the US box office. I found a useful website recently called The Numbers - 'Where Data and the Movie Business Meet', which gives the ability to create charts of box office comparisons between films. In the chart I have added below you can see a comparison between 'Logan Lucky' and two other popular comedy films involving NASCAR; Taleladega Nights and Days of Thunder. As you can see Logan Lucky did not break any box office records for the genre, in fact it probably only managed to break even despite it being full of star power. This appears to be largely down to marketing, Steven Soderbergh chose to release this film under banner of the 'independent' FilmNation Entertainment rather than one of the big film behemoth companies. This was a noble endeavor but probably has kept the film hidden from the eyes of a lot of people who would enjoy it. Adding in the international box office the film still did fairly well bringing in a total of $49 million which puts it in the top 500 for the worldwide box office for comedy movies.Perhaps another explanation for the film's low profile at the box office was the plot, let's keep it simple, this is a heist film. Like many of Soderbergh's other films an elaborate plot is hatched to steal a large amount of money by some people that have a good moral reason to steal it and some interesting character quirks... Insert plot of Oceans 11 here... Yep that's it, this film is pretty much Oceans 11, instead of the vault at the Bellagio you have the vault at Charlotte Motor Speedway and instead of the heist occurring during a large boxing event it occurs during the CocaCola 600, which presents many great opportunities for some Ford advertising.This is where the real genius of the film emerges which is the 'screenwriter' Rebecca Blunt. Somehow, she has pulled off the most audacious heist of all, as a total newcomer she managed to take the plot of Oceans 11, disguise it with a motor race, a racetrack and some rednecks and then go on to sell it back to Soderbergh himself. For her audacity she is awarded with the second credit to roll at the end of the film. Quite an achievement for a newcomer, or was it?As it turns out Rebecca Blunt is a pseudonym for Jules Asner. Asner is, according to her Wikipedia profile, ""an elite model"" who ""...shared a bunk-room with Cindy Crawford during her modelling career"". She is also ""...known as a long-time E! personality. During her peak with the network she hosted six hours of programming daily."" Soderbergh clearly enjoyed his daily 6-hour daily doses of Asner as he decided to up this to 24-hour doses by deciding to marry her. Yep, the unknown writer Rebecca Blunt is actually Steven Soderbergh's wife. They chose to use a pseudonym because they did not want the focus on the film to be about a husband directing his wife's story.If you can get over the fact that the Soderburgh's have tried to hoodwink us all there are some things to enjoy about this film. The race driver cameos are hard to spot and fun to keep an eye out for, the quirky characters are funny and there is some decent Ford v Chevy banter. There are some great one liners, my favourite being ""I hope you have beginner's luck getting that thing into first"", which has got to be one on the best driving competence burns ever, I hope someone has that up their sleeve for Nikita Mazepin's start to the F1 season. Probably my favourite character in the film was Warden Burns who is brilliantly played by musician Dwight Yoakham. In one scene Warden Burns has a hilarious debate with a room full of rioting prisoners about which order the game of thrones books and TV series came out as part of the hostage negotiations. On the downside Seth MacFarlane is terrible, although I do think his character is loosely based on former NASCAR driver Boris Said.Despite enjoying the film, the fact that it is a disguised Oceans remake under the guise of introducing a new and exciting screenwriter puts a cloud over it. I was left feeling that the real reasons for the pseudonym were more along the lines of they did not want the story to be 'Soderberg recycles plot from Oceans 11', no matter how good this may be for the environment. Another reason could be that when you already have billions of dollars from making films it is useful to have your wife make some as well to help square things away with the IRS. I am only speculating of course, and this speculation is coming from a place of disappointment. The big heist here is the $49 million that was taken from honest punters at the box office who thought they were going to see a new film by an exciting new screenwriter. Whatever the reasons were I also don't understand how a husband and wife making a film together is a bad news story? Who knows it might even inspire other couples to do something constructive and creative together? So, I'm left disappointed by Steven Soderbergh's antics, he's taken some of my favourite actors and wasted their talents with a very predictable plot and I now feel violated because I enjoyed the experience. To quote Boris Said, ""The only way he could make amends is if he came here right now and I beat his ass.""© Copyright Racing Films",Logan Lucky
296,ciccid,I just don't understand,5,30 November 2017,"What the draw of this movie is. Lots of stars, most of which washed up, an unrealistic heist, and a twist at the end that leaves you thinking ""why did I watch this movie?""Some laughs but overall I can't figure out why I did watch this movie. Just another silly heist movie that felt too much like Oceans 11",Logan Lucky
297,p-szeto,Clever movie but could be bit shorter,6,25 November 2017,"The movie is standard Steven Soderbergh flavour in the same vein as his Ocean's 11 films. You can see his trademark hints in various scenes peppered in the almost 2 hour clip. Such as the painting of the cockroaches, the items in the trunk of the Nova. They are quickly seen but not explained yet play a part in the plot. Overall, it is a well done film. Daniel Craig is one of the best characters in the movie. So non-Bond like and chews up his part with very cool mannerisms. Channing Tatum and Adam Driver are okay. Average as best playing brothers who we seem to want us to know they are ""tight"". Like when Adam's character indicates he went to jail for his brother or when Tatum's character gets into the bar fight with the racecar drivers shortly after he has an argument with his brother. Hilary Swank's FBI role unfortunately felt really wooden. Little facial expressions and her lines sounded forced. Regarding the length of the movie, I believe it could be just as smart and clever at 90 mins instead of 1hr 58 min. There were lots of scenes with no background soundtrack. I felt it made the scenes seem longer than needed. Soderbergh's Ocean films had some upbeat tunes during a lot of ""travel/planning"" shots. Here, no so much. His signature ""here's how I put everything together"" at the end (with the upbeat tune) was nicely done. One may find the length of the movie required as to build background characters for each player in the heist. I still think it could shave more than it's current playing time. In the end - as I said - Clever movie but could be bit shorter",Logan Lucky

300,sebastianjlizarraga,Ocean's 14,7,4 September 2017,"Logan Lucky is a generally good film, it has highly competent acting, dialogue, and great dry comedy. The actors, particularly Channing Tatum and Adam Deuver incorporate mannerisms into their characters which make them seem more real. However this movie isn't perfect, the characters motivations for their actions are vague and unconvincing, seeming to be there to suit the plot rather than the character. The pacing of this film is particularly poor. The movie starts by going to fast, confusing the viewer and after the climax chooses to go way to slow boring he viewer. This is due to the movies mirroring on the Ocean's series, opting to do a fast paced montage of heist and planning and after which explains what happened. This makes the former half of the movie confusing and the latter half being boring. However my praises weigh out my complaints. This is a very funny movie and is worth seeing if you enjoyed the oceans series. 6/10",Logan Lucky

But this moved WAY too slowly for a heist flick, particularly from the director of Oceans 11- 13.The entire Seth MacFarlane subplot could have been cut, as could many of the long, slow shots of the lead characters driving back and forth between West Virginia and North Carolina. Because of the glacial pace, the humor never really gets going-- it's like trying to roll a snowball down a hill, but it only goes a few feet before stopping, then they have to set up the next joke all over again.If they cut this down to 90 minutes, it would have been a lot more exciting and funny to watch, but at just under 2 hours, it felt like a drag.",Logan Lucky

306,kevinfm2013,"A tight and smart heist film, Logan Lucky delivers laughs and thrills",8,9 September 2017,"As a filmmaker, Steven Soderbergh is incredibly difficult to pin down. Greatly experimental (Bubble, The Girlfriend Experience), indebted to classics (Full Frontal, Solaris, The Good German), daring with his approach to narrative (Schizopolis, Traffic), ambitious (Che), and mainstream (Erin Brockovich, Ocean's trilogy), Soderbergh is a man who can seemingly do just about anything and do it well. A swiss army knife of a filmmaker, Soderbergh's latest effort, Logan Lucky, brims with the same comedic energy as his Ocean's trilogy and his other more commercial efforts, yet feels wholly unique. Returning to the heist genre that he has found great success with in those very same Ocean's films, Soderbergh explores the South and a vastly different way of life that often gets mocked by the coastal cities or simply forgotten. Hitting on elements that typify the Southern way of living – NASCAR, county fairs, child beauty pageants, a love of cars, country music, and hard-working blue collar Americans – Soderbergh is able to make this a film that firmly grasps its genre elements, but has an unspoken depth and honesty about the South that is too often marginalized in film. Funny, thrilling, and packed with great characters and acting, Logan Lucky marks a very welcome return to film for Soderbergh.The titular Logan family – Jimmy (Channing Tatum), Clyde (Adam Driver), and Mellie (Riley Keough) – has long been plagued by the ""Logan curse"", a belief on the part of Clyde that the family is always doomed to be broke and destitute due to a curse on the family. Thus far, this newest trio of Logan's seems to typify this existence with Jimmy being a failed NFL hopeful due to injury and, after working in the mines of West Virginia, was just fired from his job at the Charlotte Motor Speedway for not disclosing his previous injury. Clyde joined the Army and lost part of his left arm from the elbow down. Mellie, for her part, has had nothing bad happen to her but nobody can mention it because, well, knock on wood. Now, with a scheme to rob the Charlotte Motor Speedway with the help of notorious safe cracker and prison inmate Joe Bang (Daniel Craig), the Logan family hopes to finally hit on a good streak of luck.Read the full review on Cineccentric: https://cineccentric.com/2017/09/09/logan-lucky/",Logan Lucky
307,steelhammermolly,"Funny, but more importantly, a great heist movie",7,3 September 2017,"The beginning of the movie creates the slapstick comedy feel I had expected from the trailers. Channing Tatum is absolutely perfect for his role as the loving oaf, but Adam Driver steals most of the greatest scenes. The characters in essence are far funnier than most jokes in the film. I initially thought Joe Bang (Daniel Craig) was predictable, but the writing for this character and his brothers is pure gold. The movie isn't full of huge laughs, but I was smiling the whole way through.Beyond the comedic emphasis, there is the unexpected genius that is the heist. Just when you think this is another Steve Martin's Pink Panther with better jokes, The action begins. The twists and turns, make for an epic roller coaster that you never see coming. The heavy comedic emphasis in the advertising and the beginning of the movie play with your expectations so you don't expect the uniquely, intelligent plot line to come.All in all, see this movie if you like great, stupid-funny writing and near perfect line delivery, wrapped in a fun twist of complexity (or if you just love Adam Driver).

312,chokingmessiah,Where I belong...,10,20 September 2017,Logan Lucky is a minor masterpiece of sorts. From the opening scene to the running credits you can't help but feel something magical has happened. I haven't seen a heist movie this good in a long time. The setting of West Virginia and the overall atmospherics and aesthetics of the film are something special. One of Soderberg's best.,Logan Lucky

The movie is way too long, drags like a ton of bricks, and is NOT smart by any stretch of the imagination. It is dumb, dumb, dumb. It is a heist movie with a every coincidence happening at exactly the right time and laughable misses by the guards and police. Seth Rogan was a waste.

I wanted to like this film but as you're watching it you're more complicated by the heist as it continues to move along. There are random characters or scenes put in that don't really have a purpose or just extra fat that needs to be trimmed. (Lady in the health care van??). And everything works out to the tee. Even when someone's on to them, everything conveniently works out. And the explanation at the end. What?? Sorry, could have been great but script needed an editor. Good acting all around. But, pointless, really.",Logan Lucky

My advice is; if you're bored within half an hour, do what I did and switch it off and go watch little miss sunshine instead. Now that's a great movie, and captures the witty, darkly-comic and ultimately uplifting tone I was hoping for from LL. If you don't care about character motivations or convoluted plots, and just want people talking funny like cletus, then you'll have a blast. If you want something to actually stick your teeth into, watch Little Miss Sunshine instead",Logan Lucky

Instead, I got the slowest, most boring movie I have watched in a long time, perhaps ever. To make matters worse, some of the accents were terrible. The acting was weak. I would have expected better from A-list actors but unfortunately the actors don't always have control over what they do on screen. I'm sure a lot of it is due to poor directing. The heist really isn't exciting at all. It's as slow as the rest of the movie. I found myself just wanting the movie to be over. Honestly, I'm not sure why I finished it. This was the biggest waste of my time. Please don't bother wasting your time either.",Logan Lucky

The banter between our eclectic cast of characters is what really makes this film pop, as we watch them pull off feats you might think impossible.

336,shanto-18641,boys with toys,8,11 August 2017,"logan lucky funny ""Logan Lucky"" is directed by Steven Soderbergh, written by a woman whose name may in fact be a pseudonym for Steven Soderbergh. Not only is he back from retirement, he's adding to the growing number of female filmmakers. The movie is all about the Logan brothers. Jimmy was supposed to be a big football star but then a leg injury ruined all that. Clyde lost his arm in the war in Iraq. There's a rumor that the whole family might be cursed, one the brothers want to dispel. Jimmy just lost a mining job because of his disability and apparently the brothers used to pull small heist jobs years ago, but now Jimmy has a huge plan for a big score- robbing the Charlotte Motor Speedway. To do it they need the help of Joe Bang, a safe cracker who they happen to need to break out of prison. He's played by Daniel Craig, doing his best Southern accent. Listening to Craig do it is hilarious in and of itself, but Bang is also just a goof in general.",Logan Lucky

338,richdeck,Intelligent and Evenly Paced Comedy,8,2 September 2017,"Daniel Craig is an exceptional actor - that is the first thing that sticks in your mind after seeing LOGAN LUCKY. There is no hint of James Bond and Craig's Joe Bang is hilarious. Actually, the whole cast is excellent in this film. The other night I watched A SHOT IN THE DARK (1963) and laughed out loud at the genius of the writers and the extraordinary talent of Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau. Yes, in the old film there are some bits that reference sex (a trip to a nudist colony where everyone is strategically standing behind a tree or guitar), but the attempts (successful in the case of the 1963 film) were not simply based on the shock value of raunch and scatology that is so common in films today. LOGAN LUCKY reveals a creative approach to humor. I also appreciate that Soderbergh did not just default to the same old tired Hollywood caricatures of southerners. As George Clooney opined in O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU, regarding the qualities of capable leadership, these rednecks have ""the capacity for abstract thought."" This is not a sprint though. It is an evenly paced film and Soderbergh requires you to invest your attention into the film. The investment pays off with a lot of laughs.",Logan Lucky

And I'm doing all of that not because it's like the best movie of the year or anything, but because how strongly I felt to express how good it is, compared to other movies that I thought were some of the best of their genre; and I'm talking here about Ocean's 11 & 13. For quite some time I thought they were very good, and Ocean's 12 as somewhat artistic. But boy I think differently now; Ocean's 11 & 13 are your typical popcorn flicks, with some nice visuals and catchy scenes here and there. That's it, Nothing more. But on the other hand, Logan Lucky is subtle at sometimes (in a good way) and exciting at others, with some very good performances by the main cast.

345,Ryan2718,Funny tale of two brothers,9,26 May 2018,"This is a wonderfully put together movie about two brothers recruiting a team of misfits to pull off a rather large heist. This is a must-see for any family movie night.Purely from the angle of cinematography and breakdown of stereotypes, this movie was skillfully made. I was on the floor laughing during the scene where Jimmy and Clyde recruit the Bang brothers; it was especially funny to hear how ""rednecks"" would talk about computers.One of the overarching themes of the movie was family. Jimmy was trying to rob the Speedway because he wanted enough money to move closer to his ex-wife and daughter. While there were more honest ways to obtain that money, it was still heart-warming to see his brother and sister helping Jimmy out in his mission. Despite the fact that Jimmy doesn't share the money immediately with his siblings, they still trust him after he disappears. This shows the wonderful dignity of the human person by family treating family with respect, even though they couldn't understand his actions.While this is a funny movie with a heartwarming ending, the one cautionary thing about it is the fact that our main heroes are trying to rob a bank. However, the overall tone of the movie is fairly goofy, and thus the attitude of the director obviously tells us that this film isn't in support of grand heists or jail breaks.Overall, pretty great movie. 9/10",Logan Lucky
346,torijeep,The Plot is So Lost,3,19 August 2018,"Channing Tatum, despite growing up in the South, has a terrible, unbelievable southern accent. It's like he's channeling the 1840's on a plantation somewhere. Adam Driver has a better southern accent despite growing up in California. There's a kid. Nothing to do with the plot whatsoever. There's no connection between the actors, no love or bonding there. This film is 95% dialogue and the other 5% I missed because I fell asleep. I get they were going for some indie-themed existentialism here but it fell flatter than a pancake. Adam Driver and Katie Holmes were the only highlight in this pitiful excuse for a film.",Logan Lucky
