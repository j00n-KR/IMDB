0,Leofwine_draca,Tasty popcorn,7,2 May 2021,"Nobody seems to like non-superhero action movies anymore so the slew of negative reviews here don't surprise me. However, I do and I enjoyed WITHOUT REMORSE, for what it's worth. It's a good addition to the Tom Clancy adaptations out there, not as good as the Harrison Ford classics from the 1990s, but better than some since. The plot is cliched for sure but filled with drama and incident, and the action is well directed with big set-pieces that impress throughout. A popcorn film for sure, but tasty with it.",Without Remorse
1,Prismark10,Without Remorse,5,2 May 2021,Many years ago I read Without Remorse on holiday. I thought it was a cross between Death Wish and American Gangster.This movie adaptation has been in the works since the mid 1990s. Willem Dafoe played John Clark in Clear and Present Danger in 1994. He is too old to play Clark now.This version only has Tom Clancy and Without Remorse in common with the novel.US Navy SEAL John Kelly (Michael B Jordan) is on the hunt of a Russian team that killed his wife and his former SEAL colleagues.Kelly suspects that there is a conspiracy that goes right to the higher echelons of the American government.This is a formulaic and rather cheap looking movie.It has enough action adventure to make it average. Jordan is just ok as the lead although I felt he looked a little bored.The whole movie takes place in third gear and the story is preposterous.,Without Remorse
2,nogodnomasters,I misjudged you,6,9 May 2021,"John Kelly (Michael B. Jordan) was special ops in Aleppo. They come across some Russians who they kill. The Russians go for pay back on American soil. Kelly's wife and unborn child are killed, but Kelly survives. Kelly is no John Wick with a dead puppy but he demands answers.We knew the killings were going to come home. While it doesn't mention any president by name, which one would allow Russians to kill Americans unscathed? The whole payback payback thing was poorly done. Michael B. Jordan was less than convincing his his role. Clancy has done better.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Without Remorse
3,classicsoncall,"""A big country needs big enemies.""",6,6 October 2021,"I'll take it on faith from John Clancy fans that this film had very little to do with the book of the same name, except for the names of principal characters. My fault with the film is the obtuse writing and as at least one reviewer pointed out, scenes so dark you can't tell what happened in them, only to find out later in the story. It pretty much boils down to operatives in both the CIA and it's Russian counterpart attempting to foment war with the other side, for reasons not really made clear except to keep tensions among the world powers going. Soldier John Kelly (Michael B. Jordan) comes to that realization when he eventually meets up with his Russian opposite Rykov (Brett Gelman), who had a much better handle on the state of affairs between their respective agencies. The story is wrapped around Kelly's need to seek vengeance for the murder of his wife (Lauren London) and unborn child, but the revenge motive tends to get buried in the confusing story line along the way. I don't think a second viewing would clear things up all that much.",Without Remorse
4,lee_eisenberg,"interesting story, ridiculous movie",4,24 October 2021,"I wouldn't put it past the CIA to do what they do in ""Without Remorse"", but the movie degenerates into a series of explosions, weakening any positive qualities.I hope that Brett Gelman sticks to ""Stranger Things"" and avoids this sort of movie.",Without Remorse
5,searchanddestroy-1,The worst of Sollima....,1,1 May 2021,"It is shameful that I am forced to put a rate - a minimum of stars - because this movie doesn't deserve any one. This is a disgrace for a gifted director such a Stefano Sollima, the son of the great Sergio, to provide such a crap, a straight to DVD product, though an agreeable time waster. I would have never bet a cent that such a great film maker would do this to us. I am not sure to remind it before supper, my brain.soft - hard - ware is programmed.to erase such junk stuff. Anyway with Tom Clancy,there is the eternal issue, the eternal good guys vs the bad guys. OK that's very accurate, documented, interesting for those craving for espionnage and strategy, intelligent world and action thrillers in the same time. But there are unfortunately too many clichés. Forgive me if I have.digressed a bit on Tom Clancy's books. I will only say I prefer Frederick Forsyth's ones, another master in the genre, but with not the same clichés.",Without Remorse
6,CinemaSerf,"Underwhelming, routine, over-hyped, nothing special at all....",6,7 May 2021,"Hmmm. I like Michael B. Jordan and have always liked (despite some of his more curious roles) Jamie Bell, but somehow neither of them - nor co-star Jodie Turner-Smith - can set this apart from a plethora of mediocre tech-thrillers. The former is ""Kelly"", a man whose heavily pregnant wife is murdered, ostensibly, by some Russian drugs dealers in revenge for a previous SEAL mission he undertook. He survives the same lethal attack, barely, and soon hooks up with the other two on a top secret mission that might just end up thwarting a conflagration of global proportions. Question is - well, just who is pulling the strings? Answer is - we can guess that from pretty much the first ten minutes so what we are left with is quite an entertaining, admittedly, collection of set piece action scenes with loads of planes crashing, bombs going off, snipers, pyrotechnics - indeed pretty much everything you can imagine before an ending that is just plain rotten. It has sequel written all over it, but given the writing has nothing at all of the Tom Clancy about it aside from his characterisations, I suspect that would merely be another unremarkable outing from actors who have much more to offer than this derivative stuff. It isn't terrible to watch, but I dare you to not start doing something else whilst it is on...",Without Remorse
7,FeastMode,another unsatisfying streaming movie,3,9 August 2021,"I don't have anything specific i hated about this movie. It just didn't do anything for me. It did a bad job of getting me invested in the story or the characters. The parts that are supposed to be intense didn't make me feel the stakes or any kind of suspense. The longer the movie went on, the less i cared about what happens in the story or to the characters. And the action is mediocre.Actually i do have a specific complaint. So many parts of the movie are sloppy in the sense that the viewer is not sure what's happening in a scene. I'm not talking about shaky-cam/quick-cut fight scenes. They just did a bad job of producing a continuous flow that a viewer can follow. And a lot of the scenes were so dark. On more than one occasion i didn't know who was fighting who or which character was shot. No wonder i stopped caring. Fail.I came back after finishing the review because i remembered a couple more things. Maybe i just checked out early causing me to forget. But the dialogue is atrocious. And there is an ""ah ha"" moment that makes zero sense. To keep it vague, it's okay if a specific person dies. But logically, it wouldn't make any difference based on what they're trying to avoid (1 viewing, 8/8/2021)",Without Remorse
8,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Distracting enough, but ultimately forgettable",7,3 May 2021,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAfter a mission goes wrong, Navy SEAL John Kelly (Michael B. Jordan) is glad to return home to be with his pregnant wife Pam (Lauren London) and settle down for a bit. However, his happiness is short lived, when Pam and his unborn child are killed, and he narrowly survives a home invasion. In his quest for justice, he encounters obstruction from top brass Secretary Clay (Guy Pearce) and Robert Ritter (Jamie Bell), but with the help of friend and fellow SEAL Karen (Jodie Turner-Smith) he heads to Russia to take revenge. Kelly is sprung from jail for this to lead a special operation, where he learns there is more behind his family's death than meets the eye.In the absence of anything else more appealing to watch on Saturday night, Amazon Prime offered up this effort, promoting itself as an adaptation of one of the late author Tom Clancy's work, but with a standard, formulaic revenge plot line that would serve well in an average Steven Seagal film. And indeed, it mostly plays out this way, with the standard dull, grey lighting and humourless script that is the order of the day these days.In the lead role, Jordan fits the bill as a muscular action hero and has an effective presence, with decent support from co star Turner-Smith, with whom he shares a convincing chemistry. In more background roles, established stars Bell and Pearce are well cast as shady military brass with more of a stake in the proceedings as events roll on, and the plot becomes more intricate and interwoven, with some unexpected twists and red herrings thrown up to keep it interesting.Well made and intelligent enough to hold your attention, but ultimately pretty perfunctory and workmanlike, and without laughs, so it won't linger in your memory long after you've seen it. ***",Without Remorse
9,Cineanalyst,Someone Should be Remorseful for This,3,30 April 2021,"A generic shoot-'em-up that Hollywood used to do with Westerns ever since they began making movies. It doesn't matter that there's the military, espionage and geopolitical conspiracies involved in the Tom Clancy variation on the formula; it's always the same thing. The baddie and his red herring are so obvious that one of them might as well be wearing a black hat. But, sure, the action is standard, if darkly lit, and Michael B. Jordan fits the part of a muscular star to recognizably pose between the rest of the interchangeable tropes. Maybe you'll even find ""Without Remorse"" a bit fun with him not playing by the rules, out for revenge as he is. For crying out loud, we even get a mid-credits scene setting up a franchise.When a movie is this dull, I start desperately looking for something to be worth my attention. One character makes a point regarding the Cold War having brought Americans together, whereas now without a common enemy one half sees the other half as the enemy. That comes too late to matter, though. There's also the business of Jordan's character telling his enemies to say his murdered wife's name. That got me thinking about the SayHerName campaign, but the picture doesn't do anything with its star being an African American, and in one sequence he takes out an entire squad of Russian police officers who are just doing their jobs. So, yeah, there's nothing here.",Without Remorse

11,851222,Excellent thriller,9,19 May 2021,"Greetings from Lithuania.Tom Clancy's ""Without Remorse"" (2021) was an excellent 2 hours long action thriller. I did not read a novel, and i only at the end of the movie kinda remembered that character of of Michael B. Jordan's was the same played by Willem Dafoe back in 1993. So i was open minded before watching this movie and the only thing i read was that it got mainly negative reviews from critics and i saw a low score of 5.8 here on IMDb.All that put aside, i highly enjoyed this movie for what it was - a very skilfull made 2 hours long action thriller. I loved music in it, directing was superb and acting by Michael and Guy was excellent - as usual. I liked the story as well as this world created here - i would definitely like to see a sequel. Rainbow Six which it was hinted at the end.Overall, ""Without Remorse"" is a dark and gritty action thriller. Maybe its not as clever as novels, but looking for a good movie will find it here.",Without Remorse

13,Thanos_Alfie,Nice action movie...,6,11 May 2021,"""Without Remorse"" is an Action - Thriller movie in which we watch a United States Navy SEAL seeking revenge for the death of his wife. As soon as he starts searching more about it he finds himself into a large conspiracy that will affect everyone's lives.I liked this movie because despite its simple plot it had some plot twists that made it interesting. The direction which was made by Stefano Sollima, it was very good and he presented very well his main character, his thoughts and his dreams. The interpretation of Michael B. Jordan who played as John Kelly was very good and he did an excellent job at his part. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Jodie Turner-Smith's who played as Karen Greer, Guy Pearce's who played as Secretary Clay and Jamie Bell's who played as Robert Ritter. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Without Remorse"" is a simple, interesting, action movie that is good to spend your time with, if you have high expectations from it then I advise you to lower them.",Without Remorse
14,cruise01,The start of an espionage shoot em up thriller that never slows down.,10,30 April 2021,"5 out of 5 stars.Tom Clancys Without Remorse is an awesome action thriller film. About an Navy seal John Kerry ( Michael B. Jordan) after a mission that didnt seem right. When his team is assassinated and his wife is murdered. And he is left for dead. He goes on a revenge spree to track down on who set them up. Which unravels a conspiracy which he can not trust anyone.Great plot. I never read the Tom Clancy novel. So i would not know how close or different the novel is to the movie. The plot was great. It did not fall in a too political conspiracy category. Besides the idea that there may be a cover up within the CIA. Or a plot that is setting one up for a bigger consequence. There is a twist that seemed predictable.The direction is fast paced. It is one hell of a thrill ride. Throwing in a espionage world with John and a team who are highly skilled on how they operate. The action sequences are plenty. And exciting. Lots of shoot em up action. That makes this film entertaining.The cast ensemble is great too. Michael B. Jordan nails the character John Clark. Going rogue to find out who murdered his wife. And will stop at nothing.I say this is one of the better Tom Clancys films. Which the other films were too political with there plot devices. The movie is gritty. Violent and on the edge thrill ride.Overall, it is one action packed thriller that never slows down. While setting up for a sequel for another mission for John Clark. Which Michael B. Jordan might be creating a new franchise.",Without Remorse

16,paul-allaer,"Enjoyed this wild ride, with Michael B.Jordan in excellent form",7,30 April 2021,"As ""Without Remorse"" (2021 release; 109 min.) opens, we are in ""Aleppo, Syria"", and a Navy SEALs team led by John Kelly is making a daring recuse of an FBI operative held captive by the Syrian government. Except that it turns out that the hostage is held by Russians, not Syrians... We then go to ""Washington, DC, 3 months later"" and our hero John Kelly is at a bbq cookout with his highly pregnant wife. In a parallel story, two other SEAL members of that Aleppo mission are viciously murdered... At this point we are 10 min. Into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film adaptation of a Tom Clancy novel. Let's be clear: the production team went all out with this, and money seemingly was no object. But does that make for a good film? The film is directed by Stefano Sollima, whose previous work includes ""Sicario 2"". Most importantly, the film stars Michael B. Jordan (""Creed"", among many others), and he is in great form throughout. The film brings a nice mix of all-out action scenes and some calmer moments, and also a good number of plot twists (who is really the bad guy here? You might be surprised!). The production sets are top notch. And the original score is from none other than Jonsi (of Sigur Ros). Bottom line: this movie just flew by in no time, and I found it surprisingly entertaining, even if the plot ultimately is rather conventional if not predictable. Frankly, I don't understand the many, many outright negative reviews of this on here. Were you not entertained by this film? I know I was.""Without Remorse"" was supposed to open in theaters last summer, but a little thing called COVID-19 had other plans, and hence the release of this big budget film (like most others) was delayed and delayed, and ultimately Amazon Studios stepped in and bought the distribution rights. The film was just released on Prime Video (where I saw it) and here on Amazon Instant Video. If you are in the mood for a mindless and entertaining Tom Clancy movie, or simply are a fan of Michael B. Jordan, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",Without Remorse
17,JoBloTheMovieCritic,Without Remorse,5,14 May 2021,5/10 - rather boring action thriller is elevated only by Jodie Turner-Smith and Michael B. Jordan.,Without Remorse
18,alindsay-al,A Poor Generic Action Film,3,11 May 2021,"This film has been heavily marketed by Amazon and I have finally found the time to watch it and here is my review for Without Remorse. The premise of the film sees an elite soldier go on the hunt after his wife is killed.Main Character
Over the last few years Michael B Jordan has become a real film star and that shows here as he manages to add a little bit to this completely bland character. Jordan just has the presence of a movie star and it is sometimes exciting to see him take down bad guys are here. But the issue is that this character is incredibly dull and boring, I never once cared about him and his motivations despite the fact I clearly should. A weaker actor then Jordan would have been totally useless but he manages to save it a little bit.Supporting Characters
This film has an impressive supporting cast. Jodie Turner-Smith, Jamie Bell & Guy Pearce are in the film and it feels very similar to the main character in that these actors do a decent job in their roles but their characters are so basic and generic it is unreal. When you have a talented cast, it feels worse that their talent has been wasted and that these roles might as well have gone to up and coming actors who could have got themselves recognised a bit.Story
The story is here is as bland and generic as possible. It has some similar vibes to a film like John Wick but that has way more depth and unique world building to it that this film didn't. I didn't care about any of the characters and any twist and turn is incredibly predictable from minute one to the final minute and it just did nothing for me.Script
The script also did nothing. It takes itself incredibly seriously and misses the mark. The drama is dull and not conveyed well enough and there is a lack of balance in terms of the tone and it just causes this film to be incredibly forgettable.Style
The style is possibly the most important part of an action film and this film does it okay. There are some decent action sequences that are well performed and that is crucial to any sort of entertainment that is here. But there isn't any action scene that really wowed me, it just feels a bit safe and forgettable and that is how the majority of people will see this film.Overall
Overall, Without Remorse is a poor action film. It is clear that this is meant to be a start of a Tom Clancy Film Franchise but this is a bad start and there are plenty of better action films out there to sink your teeth into.",Without Remorse

If it wasn't for Jordan and Bell's acting I probably would've give this movie a 3.5 stars. Disappointing doesn't necessarily mean terrible, though.

There was no respectable villain and the plot felt incredibly bland and simple.",Without Remorse
21,valleyjohn,Just too dull,6,3 May 2021,"I love a movie based on a Tom Clancy novel.The Hunt For Red October , Patriot Games , The Sum Of All Fears and Clear And Present Danger and four great action films that i can think of from the top of my head.Sadly Without Remorse isn't anywhere near good enough to mentioned in the same breath as those despite another good leading man.Seeking justice for the murder of his pregnant wife, an elite Navy SEAL uncovers a covert plot that threatens to engulf the United States and Russia in an all-out war.Without doubt , the best thing about this film is Michael B Jordan. He's a very watchable actor who is going from strength to strength.The film itself had plenty wrong with with it.The story doesn't have the appeal of a typical Clancy film.In fact it's pretty dull and the same goes for the action.It feels like a game of Call Of Duty and after i while i was zoning out.There is also one very poor bit of casting .Jodie Turner-Smith who plays Karen Greer is not convincing at all.Her acting is wooden , she definitely doesn't look like someone from the special forces and they couldn't even get a military uniform that looked right on her.If you stay till the end of the credits there is another scene in which they indicate that there is going to be another film and it's hinted that it will be Rainbow Six.I'm not sure there will be much call for it after this offering.",Without Remorse

23,jadepietro,Without Much Sense,5,2 May 2021,"IN BRIEF: Overblown spy thriller that grows more contrived with each predictable twist and turn.JIM'S REVIEW: (MILDLY RECOMMENDED) There will be explosions, fights, and convoluted political intrigue. After all, we are in Tom Clancy Country. The plot is basically God bless the USA and kill anyone in your way, especially those Commies. Director Stefano Sollima's Without Remorse is a basic rehash of most of Mr. Clancy's successful novels. The plot devices continue to work...just change the titles. The film is hardly based on his 27 year-old book written in 1993; only the title and some characters remain. This film version has been updated for today's mindset with enough violence and high adrenaline action to suffice any non-discriminating moviegoer.A Navy Seal named John Kelly (Michael B. Jordan) is out for revenge and embarks on an international espionage Cold War mission. The talented Mr. Jordan is always good and he fills the role as The All-American Black Hero very nicely. He may not have superpowers, but he heals quickly, looks awfully sexy, and can pack a powerful punch. Jamie Bell and Guy Pierce are also on hand in supporting roles, but it is only a winning Jodie Turner-Smith as Karen Greer, Kelly's commanding officer and loyal friend, that cuts a convincing figure.The screenplay by Taylor Sheridan and Will Staples bears little resemblance to the novel, but it mimics Mr. Clancy's persona quite well. The story is just a mere outline, a way of moving from Point A to Point B. It's rote storytelling, but still an alluring ruse and justification for all of the brutal action surrounding it. The sudden twists and turns are not at all surprising, just bewildering. Conspiracy theories, double crosses, gunfire, car crashes, political hyperbole, and villainy are commonplace here, They are mere filler for the well-choreographed stunt work and hand-to-hand combat scenes that frequent the movie.As the film tries to unravel its mystery, the narrative becomes more complicated than needed, with an overabundance of LOL (Leaps of Logic) around every corner. By the time we get to the conclusion, the storyline, plus John Kelly's larger-than-life heroic deeds, become more ludicrous, just a few paces this side of absurd. No one could survive some of these physical wartime encounters and come away basically unscathed as our hero does on numerous occasions. Somebody give this man a cape and some colorful spandex tights already!Despite a strong performance given by the ever-reliable Mr. Jordan, Without Remorse is standard spy stuff...nothing more and definitely less. (GRADE: C)",Without Remorse
24,mhorg2018,Weed Road says it all!,1,3 May 2021,"Right at the beginning, one of the production companies is WEED ROAD. That pretty much says it all. Apparently they were smoking quite a bit when they made this travesty. Lately Hollywood has been doing a few things I really hate:
1 - Calling a movie an 'adaptation' of a Novel, when it's clear no one involved has read the novel, or cares enough to get past a few names.2 - Factless and Woke. Oh, it's so nice that Clark's CO was a woman. Except for ONE SMALL DETAIL - There are no women in the SEALS. No matter how much Hollywood wants this to happen - it hasn't happened yet. SEAL training is the hardest in any branch of the US Military.3 - PC. Which goes hand in hand with the woke crap that is killing movies. Can't anyone write a good woman character (SEE: JUNE in HANDMAID'S TALE for one prime example) without her being perfect? And why does every villain lately have to be a white male? As a white mail, I'm feeling more and more alienated by this. Fortunately I read a lot, so if I decided to simply stop going to the movies or watching any TV show after 2018, I'll be fine.Onto this movie. It sounds more like David Hagberg's ""Retribution"" where US Seals are being attacked in the US because of the attack on Osama Bin Laden. Sound familiar? Because it's the plot of this movie, not Without Remorse, which has a Navy Seal, an unmarried Navy Seal, whose girlfriend, NOT wife, gets murdered by drug dealers. He does get wounded and survive to go on to have a private war in Baltimore while he's training to rescue POW's in Viet Nam. So what happened here? Really the book would have made a better mini-series. But whoever 'adapted' this needs a good swift kick in the butt. This was just trash.",Without Remorse
25,arungeorge13,This one bites the dust in no time! [+33%],3,4 May 2021,"Ugh, what a drag this one turned out to be! When you realize that Without Remorse is supposed to lay the foundation for Rainbow Six (which went on to revolutionize first-person shooters), it comes off as an even weaker attempt. Taylor Sheridan collaborates with video game writer Will Staples on a script that's best described as a hotchpotch of action film clichés. Bad Russian sub-bosses, a broken ex-soldier, monologues on American patriotism, zero character development, big nonsensical conspiracy theories, and a twist that's as predictable as it can get - you name it - this flick's got it!I usually dig the grit in Sheridan's scripts. Wind River and the Denis Villeneuve-directed Sicario are personal favourites. Without Remorse, however, has none of it. Michael B Jordan is a fine actor, but the shoddy material that he's given to work with does him no good. The set-pieces fail to excite, even with stuff blowing up every third minute. The final nail in the coffin is the main antagonist's ""why"" exposition, and by the time we get to hear it, we've stopped caring about the film altogether.",Without Remorse

27,IonicBreezeMachine,Decent action and a good lead in Jordan in service of a very basic stock action thriller.,5,10 May 2021,"Three months after leaving the Navy SEALs following a rescue op in Aleppo that resulted in a confrontation with Russian military that was withheld by CIA agent Ritter (Jamie Bell), John Kelly (Michael B. Jordan) now works in private security living with his pregnant wife in the Washington D. C. area. When Kelly and two of his teammates are hit by assassins Kelly is the only one to survive but losing his wife and unborn child in the process. Kelly is told by his friend and commanding officer Lt. Commander Karen Greer (Jodie Turner-Smith) that the hit squad was identified as having tenuous ties to Russian intelligence and is being buried by the CIA in the hopes of quelling tensions. Kelly furious with his wife's murder going unanswered for takes matters into his own hands by hunting down those responsible, but soon discovers there are much bigger elements at play.Based on the 1993 book of the same name, Without Remorse serves as the origin story of John Clark/John Kelly a character in Tom Clancy's Ryanverse that has been featured in a number of books and film adaptations. Without Remorse had begun development under Savoy Pictures back when the studio paid $2.5 million for the adaptation rights and intended as a vehicle for Keanu Reeves. When Reeves turned it down the film languished in development hell with attempts to court Gary Sinise and Laurence Fishburne also stalling until Savoy's collapse in 1998. Another attempt was made by Paramount in 2012 in an attempt to build a cinematic universe on the back of the Chris Pine led Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, but this version was also scrapped. The final version scripted by Taylor Sheridan and Sicario: Day of the Soldado and ZeroZeroZero director Stefano Sollima seems like it has all the ingredients for an effective gray and intense Clancy inspired thriller, but the end product is unfortunately less than the sum of its parts as it comes off as a generic espionage thriller that just happens to have Clancy connections.First off Michael B. Jordan is actually quite good in the role as John Kelly, he sells the action scenes and the character scenes and you can definitely feel the barely contained anger and despair that drives him to do what he does. The fight scenes are all fairly well staged and have good use of special geography and a sense of weight and impact and director Solima places the focus of the action right where it needs to be to make these scenes feel all the more visceral and intense.The rest of the movie is unfortunately not as good. From the moment we're introduced to the movie it becomes all too clear its going to be one of those stock thriller plots where we'll spend 70% of the movie chasing after the alleged target only to have the rug yanked out from under us and reveal that the guy you already figured out was behind it is the true culprit. If you've seen maybe 80% of espionage movies post Mission: Impossible (1996) you'll be able to figure out who's behind what and why as soon as the characters are introduced. It's disappointing because the movie does have a lot going for it and an excellent pedigree both behind and in front of the camera.Without Remorse is a disappointing movie. Despite a more than capable cast and crew the movie ends up settling for mid-level action thriller and espionage cliches that feel disposable and predictable. There's some good work from Jordan in the lead and the action scenes are well staged, but there's nothing in Without Remorse that makes it stand out from the crowded field of action thrillers.",Without Remorse

And I was scrolling down and saw this and I said cool black guy , some action, Tom Clancy even though I don't read his stuff, I thought try it since I did read some bad reviews on here I was very very worried, and yes they do make some viable complaints for for the fans of the source , it appears that the film is strays from this prose source, but dang I found it to be action packed to the max with cool glimpses of many other action films with also with a very cool surprise ending! And the acting from the black people was awesome! I love that girl from Queen and Slim, hope she does a lot of cool stuff! The guy is also cool, the lead guy! So yeah, I guess if you read the book it might be different and yes I do agree why call it a Tom Clancy joint when it's not , very true, but as a stand alone flic, action packed! To the hilt! Lol! I don't even know how one (Mr. Clancy) can describe all this action in a prose book lol! So give it a try , Prime seems to be pretty cool!",Without Remorse

Michael Jordan and Jamie Bell gave phenomenal performances. For me, it is that tension between Jordan and Bell that makes the film work.If you aren't a military nerd; neurotic and pedantic book reader, you will very likely like it. But if had read the book and you are looking for absolute accuracy, join the Karens trashing the film. For everyone else who enjoys a good action film where all of the actors actually speak fluent English instead of mumbling their lines and lifting weights into their 60s or 70s in Hollywood.

31,markthomassintek,Terrible adaptation,5,9 May 2021,"REVIEW - WITHOUT REMORSEAMAZONTom Clancey has written some truly exceptional spy books many of which have been made into films far too many to mention here so the latest has a lot to live up to, does it?Out hero is on a mission, upon returning to America the team gets killed off one by one but because our hero is better than the rest he doesn't get killed but his pregnant wife does so of course he sets out to find who is responsible.Attacking a diplomatic to find out who it was he gets throw into prison, where the CIA release him to go into Russia and do what they officially can't.In Russia (which is a very messy story) the team find out what exactly is happening, then get trapped and escape, that's it, so the whole premise of the original story is simply forgotten purely to have the opportunity to make a sequel, why?What a complete waste, the original story could have been told and still had the premise to create a sequel.I can only imagine that the film makers decided upon this way to go but it does make a messy story and threads just left hanging, noooo.Rating 5 out of 10.",Without Remorse

34,kuarinofu,Without Moving the Camera,3,2 May 2021,"Short version - WR is a boring moderately budgeted b-movie action schlock.Diving deeper into it we will only find more problems.The story feels like it came from an unused script from 20 years ago. Well, you'd say that Clancy wrote WR in 1993, so it makes sense. Well, no, cause this has nothing to do with the original story. The TC name (and John Kelly) are here only for marketing purposes.Only Kelly/Clark can be called a character in this, other than that nobody else resembles a human being (they make sure to mention their names, but I am unable to recall any of them). The story propels itself, everything is convenient when necessary, they make huge stretches and butcher realism so hard you can barely relate to what is happening on screen. The twist of the film will work on you only if you have never seen a film before. Even a 12 y.o. Kid these days would spot the obvious thing they're doing.The action could've been interesting, but it's shot with flat angles with the camera standing perfectly still. So, no real sense of involvement or anything. Some of the action scenes (like the introductory one) were unnecessary and brought nothing into the film. The plane scene was cool though, if not made a little worse due to stale shots and basic editing.MBJ sometimes acts like a gangsta rapper, sometimes like a broken man, sometimes like Rambo, sometimes like a trained superspy. It would've probably been better if they would stick with one thing at a time, making him a multitalented superhuman wasn't a good choice IMO. Jodie Turner-Smith felt and acted confused, I'm not sure if she even knew they were filming around her. Jamie Bell was okay, but his character doesn't really make sense in terms of the story.Overall - not recommended even as a dumb action flick cause the action is butchered and there is nothing else in this.",Without Remorse
35,msbreviews,Without Remorse follows a compelling protagonist in a path of revenge through intense action sequences triggered by the usual cliches and storytelling formulas of the genre.,6,1 May 2021,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Tom Clancy is the author behind the famous Jack Ryan series of books, which were eventually adapted to the big screen. While the original trilogy with Alec Baldwin and Harrison Ford is fondly remembered by most people, including myself, the XXI century's reboots with Ben Affleck and Matt Damon were nothing but failed attempts at reviving a movie franchise. John Krasinski's TV show was apparently successful, but unfortunately, I didn't watch it. So, why not a spin-off? Michael B. Jordan comes in for a supposedly two-part film series with John Kelly - famously known as John Clark - as the main character. Stefano Sollima rejoins forces with Taylor Sheridan - both worked on Sicario: Day of the Soldado - accompanied by the debutant co-writer, Will Staples.I can't consider myself a Jack Ryan ""fan"", but I do remember enjoying the first three movies. I don't possess any knowledge about the story told in the books or John Kelly himself, so I watched this Amazon Studios flick with simple expectations of receiving a decent enough action film. Overall, that's precisely what I got. The runtime under two hours flies by due to the numerous action sequences, which are obviously the most entertaining element of the entire movie. From the long takes with intense fight choreography to the more steady, suspense-driven situations, Without Remorse doesn't have extended intervals between each action set piece, which will satisfy viewers solely looking for the more energetic stuff.The stunt work needs to be complimented. The team behind the riveting, loud, exciting action deserves to be addressed since they're the ones who truly make this type of film popular and successful. With that said, every movie requires the two pillars of filmmaking - story and characters - to be well-built, which is something this film only partially accomplishes. Despite John Kelly holding a tragic, dark backstory and emotionally compelling motivations, his character arc follows the generic development formula viewers have seen previously in other movies of the same genre. Regarding the narrative, it's really no more than a direct revenge story with an inconsequential, uninteresting socio-economic, political angle, all being easily predictable from the get-go.Michael B. Jordan (Creed, Black Panther) delivers a remarkable physical and emotional performance, carrying the whole film on his shoulders. By incorporating his character's complicated, complex feelings of anger, grief, sadness, and sorrow, Jordan offers a captivating display that holds the viewers' attention until the very end. Unfortunately, every other actor-character combo is so far away from the efficiency of the protagonist that all are pretty forgettable. From Jamie Bell's (Rocketman, Snowpiercer) bland interpretation to Jodie Turner-Smith's (Queen & Slim) forced efforts, the scripts for every secondary character are filled with either exposition or irrelevant pieces of dialogue.Clearly, this is yet another attempt to revive an action saga, which I don't think has a place today. From Mission: Impossible to John Wick, passing through Fast & Furious and the superhero universes, a Jack Ryan spin-off might just be interpreted as another random flick instead of serious competition to any of the before-mentioned franchises. Final praises to Philippe Rousselot's camera work and Matthew Newman's editing, which contributed to some impressive, entertaining scenes. In the end, that's all that matters to a massive chunk of the audience.Without Remorse follows a compelling protagonist in a path of revenge through suspenseful, intense action sequences triggered by the usual cliches and storytelling formulas of the genre. Michael B. Jordan is the star of the show, delivering a remarkably captivating performance that helps Stefano Sollima's movie survive its unsurprising screenplay. Taylor Sheridan and Will Staples focus on building an interesting ""hero"", but forget to apply that same level of dedication to the narrative and the secondary characters. Overall, it's a fast-paced, action-driven film that will satisfy most viewers looking for something to watch on the weekend. Exceptional stunt work that must not be forgotten. However, if you desire a more creative, unique take on the Jack Ryan universe, maybe the sequel will do a better job.Rating: B-",Without Remorse
36,SoumikBanerjee25,The Character of John Clark Deserved Better!,2,3 May 2021,"With its formulaic modus operandi, ""Without Remorse"" tragically conveyed the feel of true Remorse. Amazon Studio's latest venture into Tom Clancy's universe turned out to be a colossal disappointment! Atrocious Writing, Mediocre Performances, and Conspicuous Enfeeblement in terms of presenting its Action made the entire experience bitterer!Right from its introductory sequence; I realized, something amiss. In spite of the fact that it immediately gets underway with Gunfight & Explosions, the particular way in which they handle all of it created an impression of nonchalance!Excluding some gratifying moments that clearly demonstrate Cinematographic flair; in other parts, it's got its own set of problems! Such as the Score; frequently masking pivotal parts of every other conversation. Furthermore, Lighting in certain scenes appears to be too dim. Likewise, the Screenplay inflicted with apathy often enough! Translating into an uninspiring array of events.Speaking of Performances, I find them to be average at best. Michael B. Jordan is a known performer and we are all aware of his capabilities as an actor. With such shoddy script in hand; there was nothing he could do. From my point of view, the character of John Kelly/Clark deserved greater representativity!All things considered; personally this hasn't been a pleasant viewing, not a bit!

I probably enjoy these types of movies more than most and I still found myself straining to stay interested.Jordan is terrific and brings a hulking presence to the action scenes. The set pieces are solid, but it's hard to care much about them when the story is this unoriginal. The whole mood is just very dour too.

39,trinaboice,"Not bad, but not Tom Clancy's story",7,30 April 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Amazon Studios brings us an action-packed military thriller named after the best-selling novel by Tom Clancy in 1993 Without Remorse (John Clark Novel, A). John Clark, played by Michael B. Jordan, is a Navy SEAL who goes on a path to avenge his pregnant wife's murder only to find himself inside of a much larger conspiracy.This film adaptation has been in development since the 1990s. Keanu Reeves was even offered $7 million for this role, but actually turned it down! After many years of starts and stops with different actors, it has finally been announced that this Michael B. Jordan version will be a two-part film series that includes Rainbow Six by Tom Clancy (1998-08-03) and be directed by Stefano Sollima.THINGS I LIKED:
The cast includes some of my favorite actors. Michael B. Jordan delivers a solid performance in every movie he's in. He also produced this movie.Jamie Bell is consistently fantastic as well. He and Michael B. Jordan were last seen in a movie together in Fantastic Four in 2015.Toss in Guy Pearce, who is always intense, and you have a solid acting trio. I thought his recent performance in The Last Vermeer was excellent. You can read my review or watch it on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!John Kelly/John Clark is a character that has also been played by Willem Dafoe in Clear and Present Danger (I love that movie!) and by Liev Schreiber in The Sum of All Fears.You have to wait for an entire split second before the action starts.That car fire stunt scene was impressive and crazy!There is a LOT of action.Keep watching during the rolling credits at the end of the movie for another scene that introduces the idea for the sequel.I've read quite a few very negative reviews, but this movie isn't as terrible as those reviews would have you believe. I was entertained.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Unfortunately, if you're a fan of Tom Clancy's book Without Remorse (John Clark Novel, A), you'll be disappointed that this movie is very different from what's inside the pages of the best-selling novel. So, why call the movie Tom Clancy's Without Remorse if they're not even going to use the story in the novel? The script was written by Taylor Sheridan and Will Staples. Audiences have expected much better since Taylor Sheridan was involved with the writing. Sadly, some of the dialogue is really dumb with lines like, ""I gotta get the Soviet!""
Jodie Turner-Smith plays a former Navy SEAL and team commander. Her character is supposed to be related to James Greer, which is a nice tie-in. Female is empowerment is great but viewers have been complaining that the movie isn't realistic and doesn't care to accurately portray the prestigious SEAL name. There never has been a female Navy SEAL. Now, I don't mind casting a woman to play the role, but she wasn't the right actress. She felt like an actress saying lines, rather than a real warrior.It's an entirely predictable plot we've seen a million times before. In order to make this movie great, the story would have to be told in a new, fresh way, but it's not.No real creative camera shots or angles. The characters take way more risks than the filmmakers do. For example, some of the shooting sequences were pretty basic.The big reveal in Act 3 doesn't surprise you because the characters all seem straightforward.I wondered if we were going to see John Krasinski do a cameo as the Jack Ryan character fromJack Ryan Complete season 1 and 2 DVD box set, but nope. Drats.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Lots of violence with various weapons
There is a very high dead-body count
Profanity
People in many dangerous situations
Explosions

I think the direction was the real problem, the movie had no rhythm, no flow, with the editing, the cinematography, and the soundtrack.There was absolutely nothing interesting or exceptional about this movie. I'm astonished that Taylor Sheridan had any association with it because it appears to be very poorly written. This was a very amateur effort, even though they likely had a good budget to work with.There was absolutely no story, one fight scene after the next, one gun scene after the next, and very little content. This was a truly horrible depiction of a Clancy novel. It's probably been since back in the days of Clear and present danger, Patriot Games and Hunt for Red October that any Clancy novel has been translated into a film with a positive outcome.Hollywood just does not seem to be capable of doing it these days asthe characters are too well written in the novels, and these characters were cardboard cutout cartoon type figures.Even Michael B.

I've not read the source material so am basing my review purely on the film (as it should be).Without Remorse has a very strong start. I loved the opening third, which was action packed and full of intrigue. The film wasted no time getting going and was pretty relentless. The action was fun and felt quite real and gritty.From this point on the plot got a bit derailed, and started feeling more formulaic. Anyone who has ever seen a similar style spy/action film will see the 'twist' coming a mile off, and it wasn't a particularly satisfying twist. The plot definitely wasn't up to scratch.Michael B Jordan put in a great performance. He wasn't furnished with the best script of his career but he made it work and delivered in the role.

Rate a movie as a stand alone regardless of whether it is a remake or from a novel...it's an entertainment.Next, I believe the tens were all an attempt to balance the overall rating from people who unfairly judged this film a one. This movie is not ten worthy and that is a no brainer.However, in a time devoid of a good action hero, Michael Jordan picks up some of the slack left from the much needed retirement of the old crew. There is a reasonable story and action sequences, albeit there are some writing holes and clichés (common to the genre).

52,stevenrotherforth,"Go watch something with Chuck, Sly or Arnie in it instead",5,4 May 2021,"Without RemorseMovie 5/10Without Remorse is an Amazon Original production that is not very original. Based on the novel by Tom Clancy. The plot may have been fresh when the publication was released but now it can be considered as being old hat. If this movie had landed in cinemas back in the 80's it would have faired much better. Sadly it's all been done before and much better.Starring Michael B Jordan it is obvious that this film needs him more than he needs the film. This is a production that would normally star the likes of Steven Seagal or Jean Claude Van Damme or perhaps Dolph Lundgren. A movie to line the bottom of a DVD bargain bin. The plot is so generic it could have been written by Sly Stallone in his sleep whilst suffering a fever.Navy Seal John Kelly (Jordan) goes on a path of vengeance after his wife and unborn child are brutally murdered. By doing so he uncovers a web of conspiracies. I can almost hear the cheesy trailer voiceover guy delivering the synopsis.""In a world........""
He usually starts with ""In a world!"" or ""One man!"" or ""This summer get ready!""My point being that this is such a product of the 80's/90's that all the characters ought to be wearing bandanas and leg warmers.Jordan is good as the action hero. Guy Pearce is the obvious choice to play his role. I'll not get into spoilers, just watch. He dials it in. Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell) has all grown up now but isn't believable in this company as some CIA,FBI,DIY generic slimy type dude.The film itself is boring for an action movie. Only the plane crash scene evokes any excitement. There's no connection to the characters or what they are going through. In 'John Wick' we rooted for Keanu Reeves because they killed his dog. In 'Without Remorse' the lead character loses his wife and child and I couldn't care less. There's no emotional build up or journey of pain to develop John Kelly as a character we could care for. This movie is all painting by numbers devoid of any heart and soul.Picture quality 7/10Available on Amazon Prime in UHD with High Dynamic Range this is the best way to see the movie. For the most part the image is 4K slick. Some scenes show cinematic film grain but mainly the image is crisp. The use of HDR10+ elevates explosions and vibrant city lights but shadow detail seemed a little muddled in some very dark scenes.Sound quality 6/10Once again Amazon Prime fail to meet the competition when it comes to Object based audio. Netflix, Apple TV, Disney Plus and even Sky Cinema offer their Original titles with Dolby Atmos sound.'Without Remorse' gets a vanilla 5.1 mix in the form of Dolby Digital Plus. It's a lacklustre mix too. Surround sound effects are mostly vacant even in the action scenes. The plane crash sounded rather dynamic but there's not much going on for a modern day produced action flick. Gun shots and explosions all have the expected heft but just like the film itself there's a sense of excitement missing here too. Vocals are always audible but nothing impresses the senses. Why can't Prime video step up and offer Dolby Atmos? Even the titles you have to pay for don't have the superior audio codec.'Without Remorse' needed a dynamic mix to lift the film out of the mire.

The plot is quite generic, but I think it was overall well written, and it always keeps you thinking (at least for me). Yes, the story isn't all that emotional, and it's a pretty cliched revenge tale, but there are far worse screenplays I've seen from other action movies.The acting was okay to decent. There's a lot of reviews piling on the movie for having ""bad"" performances, but there was never a scene where the acting was visibly bad.I also think the action was done rather well. There's no shaky cam and it's easy to tell what's going on. Unfortunately, there are a lot of scenes where the bad guys have stormtrooper aim, and it'll really ruin your suspension of disbelief. The set pieces were also pretty good, especially the plane sinking scene.Overall, Without Remorse is a pretty decent action flick. It's not the best Seal movie, and it's not the best revenge movie, but it's definitely not the worst.

Jordan as John Clarke or originally John Kelly, Tom Clancy's shadow recruit ex-Navy SEAL is getting his origin story in this flick. Now just to give you movie goers a heads up, this flick is nothing like Clancy's novel, there maybe a few characters who pop up but really this is a new story in itself. The only shared similarities other than the names of some of the characters is the title. Literally, if this flick had different character names and a different the title, this still wouldn't be a Tom Clancy film. So my main frustration here is if you are to adapt a novel into a theatrical release then either stick with the plot of the books and do them justice or don't claim to do the flick. Now this was meant to be released in cinemas but due to the pandemic and the current climate, this was delayed and released through one of the streaming giants. To me though this flick feels more like a made for TV movie or direct to DVD. The action sequences towards the end of the flick along with the plan crash where we see the main character swimming to get the package for their mission along with getting answers from a political bloke while literally burning up the car are great. The performance by Jordan as Kelly is awesome and well with what he had to work with, a guy who is not playing by the rules and is out for revenge. But so much could have been done which was written greatly in the novel, for example Kelly in the novel legit tortures a thug to death using a diving-simulation chamber - this could've been in the flick!!!The filmmakers use the right elements of military action, espionage and geopolitical conspiracies but what they fail is the blend and flow of the story. The storytelling feels flat and predictable and sometimes odd plotlines like the prison fighting sequence - its great action but doesn't get anywhere and you feel like it could've been left out or for me expected more of that mini story arc. Like if Jordan's character as Kelly planned out strategically on T-boning a car then setting it on fire and jumping into it to interrogate someone where he would be expected to get arrested and sent to prison filled with Russian mob figures to investigate more of this conspiracy than yeh I wouldn't mind that. It would of definitely felt like a mashup of Daredevil season 2 and Law Abiding Citizen but I would have been cool to watch it however this mini story just ends straight away. So why put it int there??!!?? This along with other mini story elements did not flow smoothly. Now the supposedly twist and turn - sheesh, like you pretty much know who the baddie is and the red herring is soooo so obvious, like might as well place a sign on the actual villain. Overall, the flick is disappointing especially not using the source material and if you are going to create a whole new story than either make it smooth and innovative since you are creating a new story and not hash it out from past flicks. A cluttered and conventional flick however does have cool action sequences 5.5/10.",Without Remorse
61,Mcduff3601,This fell right in the middle of meh for me,5,22 June 2021,"I can't speak to the story as I haven't read a Clancy novel in a lonnnngggg time but I can say I am a fan of the Ryan books (Hunt for Red October etc). This was a typical shallow attempt at a soldier/thriller/murdermystery.I don't think Jordan is a strong actor and in cases like that they need to be backed up by really strong supporting actors and writing, which doesn't happen here. Jodie Turner-Smith puts in some of the most boring acting I have seen in a long time. No emotion, almost as if she is reading directly from cue cards.The story is boring and so forced. There are way better movies to spend your time on than this garbage. Unfortunately this is the level you get from streaming services these days. Compared to the garbage out there now this is a 7, compared to actual good movies back in the day this is a 5. Don't waste your time on this one, go watch one of the Bourne movies, Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games. This one is a stinker, believe the bad reviews.",Without Remorse
62,Brooklynsmagicmike,"It wasn't the worst movie I've seen, but it wasn't great either",6,4 May 2021,I was looking forward to this movie for awhile from all the trailers that had been shown for it. But upon conclusion I couldn't help but feel dissapointed. I diddn't hate but it was just ok.First the movie has decent cast of actors yet the acting isn't particularly good by any means. Second the plot was all over the place and at times a bit confusing. Lastly the film had hardly anything to do with Tom Clancy and felt like it was titled this as a cash grab.With all that said though there are things that the movie did well. I thought the visuals were stunning and very impressive. The action was non-stop throughout and the movie wasn't very long so it diddn't feel draggy.Overall the movie isn't good enough to rewatch and it definitely diddn't live up to the hype. But for quick rainy day watch its at least serviceable.,Without Remorse
63,Darkjak007,Doesn't compete with the Ryan films,6,30 April 2021,"Without Remorse is Directed by Stefano Sollima. It tells the story of navy seal John Kelly(Michael. B Jordan) who's on a revenge mission seeking answers after his expecting wife is murdered. It's revealed John's whole unit is being targeted by Russian FSB after having their identities revealed. The Secretary of Defense(Guy perce) issues an covert op to kill the last FSB Assassin but to keep it discrete to not risk starting another cold war between the United States and Russia. The story is rather generic it not really all that interesting it doesn't follow the the novel at all. Outside of john being a Seal, but that's not the problem the problem is they chose to go with a really over done motive. The idea of avenging the death of the love is your basic premise for some many action film, when you have interesting character to back it up it can still be entertaining. The first 30 minutes are off to a good start. But take a a while to get going. They don't set out for Russia for about 40 minutes. Michael b Jordan gives a good performance his scenes are what drive the movie to the point that the rest of the cast is pointless they don't really contribute anything outside of commander Karen Greer(Jodie Turner Smith). Outside of being Kelly's friend and unit, you don't know anything about her You could of used more of her. The action scenes are good such as the cell scene, but with rather disappointing side characters it loses part of the structure of the movie. There's no interesting secondary character such as Sean Connery in The Hunt for Red October or Antagonist like Sean Bean in Patriot Games. The cause is not interesting it's rather abrupt and obvious feels like the climax of the movie but at this point there's only like 20 minutes left. Overall I found movie investing enough not to turn it off. It's a decent prequel for John, a welcome expansion to the character. With this film out the way setting up John Clark I'm curious what they may have plan for Rainbow Six at least.",Without Remorse

Having said this, the only salvageable aspects of this adaptation are Michael B. Jordan's correct performance along with some action sequences and that's pretty much it.While it manages to be partially engaging, most of what's going on in the story feels disappointingly generic, which basically leaves Jordan in charge to use all his diminished power to lift up this second-rate effort.

68,darkreignn,"Sanitized, scatterbrained, and sleep-inducing",3,1 May 2021,"I admit, I'm not much of a Tom Clancy reader. Sure, I've played his video games, and have even watched a few of the Jack Ryan films, but other than that, you couldn't get me to spew any trivia about him or his works if my life depended on it. So, as embarrassing as this is to admit, when I saw the promo for ""Without Remorse,"" I didn't even know it was based on a real book - I thought they were simply using Tom Clancy's name as a marketing ploy to get viewers. Regardless, this is all just a roundabout way to get you to realize that, when it comes to my review on this film, you can rest assured that I had no preconceived notions when sitting down to watch this, and nothing to base it off of; all I wanted was an entertaining action movie.""Without Remorse"" is not an entertaining action movie. I'd go as far to say that ""movie"" is even the wrong classification for this film - perhaps more accurately the FDA should state that this movie should be used in cases of extreme insomnia, because staying awake was the most thrilling part about watching this. ""Without Remorse"" stars Michael B. Jordan as John Kelly, a Navy SEAL whose wife gets assassinated, seemingly in an act of retaliation by terrorists. John Kelly goes John Wick, and blazes his way through friend and foe, all in an attempt to avenge his wife. It's a tried and true plot, one that we've seen before, but that shouldn't matter if the action was good; spoiler alert: it's not.This is the most bloodless, watered down, and sterilized R-rated action movie I've ever seen; I actually had to pause the movie toward the end and check just to make sure it wasn't PG-13. Alas, this is rated R, but you won't know it when you're watching. Besides a puddle here and there, every gunshot, knife wound, or punch is devoid of blood, which in turn makes the violence devoid of thematic impact. John Kelly stabs and shoots people point black, and not even a spatter of blood exits their body. Additionally, there is no nudity or f-bombs in this movie - combined with the utter lack of blood, I'm almost certain this was filmed to be PG-13, but for some reason the ratings board deemed it unsuitable for those under 17.Besides the lack of bloody violence, there is also a major lack of action, period. ""Without Remorse"" takes a painfully slow burn approach, and for the majority of the running time you'll be privy to horrendously dull conversations where wooden actors dump exposition to each other. The dialogue in this movie is nondialogue; the acting is nonacting; every line, every action, feels so inhuman, uncanny, and unnatural that you can practically see all of the boardroom executives who were no doubt playing god during production, all attempting to make the movie in their own vastly different image. So what are we, the viewers, left with? A scatterbrained mess where nothing and no one acts like it should.Complete with a bizarre third act decision that had me rooting against our hero, and even hoping for his demise, ""Without Remorse"" is one of rare times where I found myself actively bored with an action movie. It doesn't take much to please me, but with the sanitized action, cliched plot, and mediocre acting, ""Without Remorse"" didn't leave much to be entertained by.",Without Remorse

It does involve guns, lots of shooting, and Russia at least tangentially. But the similarity to the original plot from the book ends there.This is also one of those movies, in this new age of ours, where it's absolutely unacceptable for a white person to play an ethnic character but it's perfectly fine for an ethnic person to play an historically white character even if it makes no sense relative to the plot line.To elaborate:The primary plot of the movie (again, utterly unrelated to the plot of the book...) unfolds as a covert ops operation in Russia. The two primary protagonist characters in the movie, both of which are on the small team of ""covert operatives"", are both giant African-Americans. One is this enormous towering slab of flexing muscle with a head on top and one is a very stunning and exceptionally statuesque woman.Apparently it's one of the lesser known techniques of successful covert operations to have some members in the operation stand out like walking klieg lights in order to draw as much attention to the operation as possible. African-Americans constitute 3/100 of 1% of the overall Russian population. They'd probably stand out less while moving around Russia, and draw much less attention, if they each had three heads.But such is the politically correct world we live in today. What matters is strict adherence to the rules of political correctness. Any coherency in the plot line is just passé.I don't know. Considering how they completely brutalized the story from one end to the other, I guess picking at this particular nit is just straining at gnats.Ironically, if the movie had actually followed the original plot line from the book, having a black guy as the lead character would actually have fit perfectly.

I don't find much chemistry between any of the characters - I'm not talking about romance, okay, I'm talking about how the characters interact, and how their situations might elicit some kind of empathy or sympathy or something like that.

Without Remorse is a great action film that I didn't want to end. There is mostly action with sufficient character development to understand the plot and motives. Michael B. And Jodie Turner-Smith were outstanding. Yes, it's a bit unbelievable. Yes, it is classic Hollywood style. Personally --as a staunch Republican--I didn't notice the Woke/liberal/politically correct dishing that some reviews mention. It's certainly not as obvious as Angela's Basset's 911, if it was there. In fact, it delves into corruption in the government, which the liberals are in denial of, so there's that. Maybe those reviews are confusing women in the military with liberalism. If you're here to determine if the film does the book justice, you might want to resign yourself to the fact that's just not possible for any film. And as another reviewer pointed out, comparing it to the book instead of actually reviewing the film on its own merits is falsifying the ratings and is not fair to the film or the actors. Going in without having read the book, I found it to be a great action film with very few rest stops. It's not the next Rambo II, Thin Red Line, or Black Hawk Down but full of great Seal action with strong attention to detail.

Jordan steps into the lead role with a script rewritten by Taylor Sheridan. All this and an intense trailer pointed to a potential promising action adventure enterprise. That is not what the final product winds up being. Usually projects that are kicked around for so long are done so for a reason. Despite some promise this film winds up being a jumbled mess. The action set pieces aren't very good. The espionage plot is as confused as it is basic. None of the characters are very interesting or dynamic including Jordan's lead character. I wouldn't consider the film awful, but it should have been so much better.Jordan stars as Navy SEAL John Kelly and early on him and his team are in Aleppo and find themselves raiding a Russian weapons dump when they thought they were just rescuing a hostage CIA agent. Once back home members of the team start getting murdered. Kelly's wife is killed and he is critically wounded. He recovers only to be consumed by revenge and a desire to get to the bottom of what is actually going on. Nominally this murky political thriller combined with revenge action isn't a bad template but it is all carried out so ridiculously without excitement, or enthusiasm or very much good action that it all amounts to a ""who cares"" sentiment. When you do get to the end of the rabbit hole on why things are going down the way they are it seems archaic and silly. Nothing here works like it should, and unfortunately for Jordan he is the only one here that seems to be trying, and he has the goods to pull this off and be this action hero but every other facet of the movie is letting him down.This is really a shame because I like Jordan and I really like Sheridan who is responsible for 'Hell or High Water' and 'Wind River'. The trailer did make this look like a movie that demanded to be seen, but that is where all the good stuff ends. This has a cold war style plot which doesn't feel in keeping with modern times, and a revenge fueled narrative that never enters the truly heart rending violent places you want to see it go. This film felt just very basic from start to finish like not many were really putting their best foot forward. In what should have been a coup for Amazon in scooping this up from Paramount instead this feels like a step backward for the streaming service attempting to generate a high profile action franchise.Eric's Grade: D.",Without Remorse

Based on some of the reviews they are actually upset with a black lead in this type of film. Yet these same people wave American flags snd claim to love God and country.

110,JamesRutland,"Good idea, bad script and direction. Excess of simplification.",1,1 May 2021,"A mediocre representation of what it had to be. Michael B. Jordan gives too many emphasis to his character acting as if he was the only protagonist of the scene. Rather simplistic. The problem on this movie is the simplification of the complexity. I had a bad feeling in the first scene where seals go out from a water tank. Coming from where? Under? The water should have been emptied. Waiting for who? A generic place to wait enemies walking there in a place so vast for everlasting? In a scene the protagonist talks to explain to Russians the situation, when it is evident he cannot explain anything. The evidence of the mediocrity is represented by the too many holes in order to avoid to face the complexity in every described situation, making the movie trivial. There is a scene where the main character comes down the stairs among bullets and enemies everywhere. It's ridiculous. It seems that all the plot has been made by improvisation without paying attention to the context. This proofs the importance of a good team of screenwriters composed also by psychologist, educationalist, cultural anthropologist, sociologist. Michael B. Jordan should have learned a lesson from Creed: the more realistic, the more acceptable, otherwise the movie lapses in ridiculous. The necessity to make striking every action is from 80 ""b movies"" or b series"", where every 10 minutes something exploded to give the same emotion of a firework. It's good for 6/7 years old people but the story narrated in this movie faces with a demanding deep tale. Whilst it seems that the movie has been set to the greed to get easy emotions to the viewers making the scenes trivial. It's not sufficient to portrait a story so demanding.

114,shide_85,Slightly ahead of an average action...,6,1 May 2021,"...but far behind the good ones.In short:
This is Jason Bourne inspired warstory that has been done before more than once in simialr fashion. For a friday night with some mates it's a good watch, though be warned there are some propaganda pieces in there that are supposed to muddy the waters regarding topics changing the perception of reality in USA (afaik).In longer:
Not utilising Guy Pearce properly when you signed him on is allmost a crime in and of itself, some tones of what he can offer as bad guy shone through but he wasn't given enough time to truly loathe the audience (that being said he does good roles allmost as well).When it comes to the cinematography some things do stand out - the explotion work stand out together with costume and gore, backdrop lacks in a key shootout scene but is otherwise acceptable. Music is tones down and keeps a close to noneexitant life in the back. Sound is decent, nothing that really stands out.When it coems to the martial arts and firefights its above what can be exspected from Hollywood but there is still more than one moment of conquering all odds when you shouldn't (or atleast not by the actions used).The propaganda:
First propaganda piece:
Just before the 40min mark the notion is made that after the exposures of how corrupt USA warfare is/has been (neo-imperlistic fascist empire) they fought for what USA could be (not for what was good or ""correct"" intel) - obvious lies in generalisation, army fights for what the plutocrats behind the empire wants. Yes, lower ranked soldiers might not know geopolitical schemes to assertain or cosolidation of power (but it would be dangerous to accept that notion right off as soldiers can be anticipated to both be kept away from news that would hurt morale but also try to assertain news whereever it is from to gain increased knowledge of the situation they are in), elite troops who do advanced recon, waterwork or similar should have some insight and anyone above those position defintiively would have.Second propaganda piece:
As people around the globe has started to understand who really won WWII for humanity this line is pushed down the line;""the economists"" (not russians and communism with scorched earth and the support of USA). Yes that is one reality to combat another - not that it is not a direct lie even though overall the damage war does to trade is more severe than most can make on the wars. Wars are for putting the poor into the meatgrinder when desecent (information about corruption and the wrongs done by plutocrats and informal interest groups in control) starts to spread.It's followed up by the missinformative piece that WWII left USA bare, many nation shifted their gold reserves to USA and even if they did not give the USA the gold I would be surprised if USA didn't swing it's total weight. Not to mention the importance of being in the centrum of debt consolidation for the world through a hefty impact on gold reserves (it's only recently that germany, officially, has shifted their gold home).Ad on that that USA was failry unscathed WWII back home and won the race to the Nazi treasures (a fair bit stacked in a lime or salt mine) and they also captured most scientists - giving them the nuke more or less in the process.The third propaganda piece:
Half the people thinks the other half is their enemy, because they have no one left to fight. This is people vs the ruling class of plutocrats, masons et al. Those who today worship mammon and trash everyone/everything else and those who don't (people/keynes and informal interest groups & religious group/Friedman). Even if you can argue that it's passively on behalf of masons by upkeeping markets on areas where markets are counterproductive (fields efficiency kills profit or even hampers it).The religious notion:
Atleast we know what writer/group pushed those messages in: ""There is a heaven - yes.""
If you believe this world is real, the little world will be what ""we"" make of it - thus you create your own heaven or hell.Pro's

Tom Clancy was the master of the techno-thriller, mixing elements of science fiction, political thriller and spy genres, albeit Clancys extensive research helped readers understand foreign militaries and his plots eerily echoed real events to the degree rumours circulated the CIA thought he was a mole.This film has none of his subtlety. Yes, it's normal for books to change when made into a film, but all that seems left of Clancys work are a few names.On the plus side, Jamie Bell does get the sneaky company man role down. His spook demeanour in relation to the other soldiers is probably the most in keeping with Clancy.MBJ makes a decent effort as the lead, who in typical Hollywood fashion is pretty trigger happy, an amazing shot with grenades, but never seems to be in much peril, while Jodie Turner-Smith seems to only be allowed one emotion.On the other side, I'm not sure if Guy Pearce was just tired all the way through, but compared to the usual energy he shows in his other films, he was putting me to sleep.The cinematography is dark at places really hard to see what is going on. I get fighting in the dark adds to the effect, but I ended up watching one of the early fight scenes three times and only found out what had happened later in the film.

It would make great material for a 10 episode series, and then a basis to keep on with the Ryan saga.

128,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,No Regrets for Tom Clancy's Without Remorse,9,30 April 2021,"Usually, summer movie season starts in late May, Memorial Day weekend; but over the years, the summer blockbusters seem to premiere earlier and earlier. On this first weekend of May, I'm calling Tom Clancy's Without Remorse on Prime Video an early summer movie release. It's got all of the hallmarks: big-named action star (Michael B. Jordan), explosions and gun fights, and a slick look. Michael B. Jordan hasn't really headlined a summer blockbuster like this, so let's see if he makes the most of it.Tom Clancy's Without Remorse claims to be an adaptation and an origin story of John Clark, a Navy SEAL, who seeks to avenge his pregnant wife's murder after a botched mission leads to some secret operatives coming after him and his fellow SEALs. Michael B. Jordan plays John with a singularly focused intensity to figure out what happened and take out those to took his family. This film was written by Taylor Sheridan, who also wrote Hell or High Water and both Sicario movies - with those movies in his filmography, the expectations can be set pretty high for taut action and twisty storytelling.Without Remorse gives you all of the action you are promised and then some. There are some pretty cool sequences throughout both on land, in water and in the air. Not only is the action good, but it looks great, too. Also, Jordan is such a convincing action star that it's a wonder that he hasn't been in these kind of thrillers before. I get that all these actors want to be in Marvel and DC movies, but these flicks need capable stars too. Jordan could corner the market like Liam Neesons has in the old-guy-avenging-his-daughter-movies. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the rest of the cast. They are fine but kind of boring and generic. Anyone could have played these characters as there's no real personality. No one stand out positively, so it's barely worth mentioning. They don't ruin the movie, but they don't add anything either.Lastly, the plot is also pretty generic and a little obvious as these Tom Clancy thrillers go. On the other hand, it does suck you in. There are some many tense moments that occur you forget that you already know where it's going.Ultimately, Tom Clancy's Without Remorse is worth a summer movie weekend viewing. Michael B. Jordan is the draw here, and he lives up to the promise. The action is great and the movie sucks you in. Grab you big box of popcorn. You won't regret it. (See what I did there.)",Without Remorse

Mr Jordan is a far better actor than he gets to show in this flat actioner.The writing is quite poor, the editing needs work and I am underwhelmed by the director's work.There are a few issues of stretch that hurt the credibility. Seal Trams are led on ops by Lr Commanders or Commanders but they don't go into the field. The field Seals are nearly always enlisted personnel and seasoned NCOs. I am no expert but I am not cognizant of any woman attaining senior officer rank in an operational detachment in the Seals although I would be pleased to be proven wrong. This incredulity impacts Ms Turner's performance which is further hurt by making her very flat as a character. Not surprising that the big baddie is a government senior bureaucrat supported by the arms industry because there are no other threats out there are there?The closing moments were really disappointing showing the whole thing is a set up for a Rainbow Six thing.",Without Remorse
148,ty-jensen,Generic spy thriller,5,2 May 2021,"I'm a Tom Clancy fan so I was excited for Without Remorse. I read some of the novels including Without Remorse and Patriot Games in fact I recently revisited Without Remorse. Without Remorse was produced by Paramount for a theatrical release but this pandemic is still serious so they sold the film to Amazon. Without Remorse is another generic spy thriller as expected.The cast was good but it's a matter of opinion, I'm sure some people feel they're just okay. Michael B. Jordan is easily the best aspect, he was passionate since he grew up playing Tom Clancy video games. Without Remorse was Jordan's second time working with Jamie Bell after Fan4stic which was terrible.The story was so generic, it's a standard revenge thriller mixed with a hollow political conspiracy. I personally feel this movie should of been a simple revenge thriller. Without Remorse was in development since the 90s so the writers should of written a better script. The novel takes place in the 70s but it easily could of been adapted properly.The action scenes are okay, they're generic. The action is gritty and grounded but it doesn't stand out. Maybe the director or stunt coordinator is inexperienced. I'm sure Jordan spent at least two weeks fight training.Overall, Without Remorse was another generic spy thriller. I think a lot of fans feel it should of been a simple revenge thriller. Jordan prevents it from being a total bore. Can you imagine Keanu Reeves playing John Clark? He was offered the role back in the 90s. If you're a Jack Ryan fan, you should see the Prime series which has only two seasons so far.",Without Remorse

It's an old plot with absolutely nothing new....not even the promised wooooh waaaah that a big budget would give.But, it's not for me. Old man river and all that. Maybe it's for the younger generation. The young adults. The twenty somethings. Because, chances are they haven't seen a rip off of any polished turd of a movie from the 90s.This is so predictable and pedestrian, I have to ask you to not bother.Action is stuff you've seen before. You never feel real peril or jeopardy.The worst of all is the ending. The explanation for why any of this happened is so lame....so written on a back of a cigarette packet (another 90s reference).....that you think that the world is run by actual idiots as opposed to me calling my brother an idiot (in a jokey way) when he accidentally switched on the electric toothbrush, with toothpaste, before he put the brush in his mouth....no not that type of idiot...the other one.There are scenes in this that are just pointless. The shirt off Michael B Jordan getting ready to box (a nudge and a wink to his role in Creed) but is just....why?I had no empathy for any of the characters in this.If you want to see an army unit do their thing and make it entertaining and almost authentic, check out ""Mosul"".If you want one man non stop action, check out ""Extraction"".There are so so many better films in this genre than this.Really, unless you have a spare box of half eaten cold pizza and a rain soaked Sunday afternoon to kill, there really is no reason to inflict this much waste of time on yourself.",Without Remorse

He is one cool operative.However, I'm not sure if this was the right script to tell the origin story of John Clark.This movie had moments. With action sequences and scenes that were well executed. The CGIs were top rate, and acting faultless. But it somehow the movie failed to engage me as a viewer. John Clark didn't come across as cool but a man bent on revenge.

Never in my wildest imagination would I have guessed that he wrote this consider the entire time through the movie I kept thinking how god awful the writing and dialog was. The main character is constantly talking to the audience (through a side character) to make sure that we are ""caught up"" with what is going on, over and over again, but the dialog doesn't even hide it well.Overall, even writing aside, there just isn't a good movie here. It's very unfortunate what is happening, and i'm not even sure I know what, but I have no doubt this very low quality(plot wise, not production value)/low suspense movie will be ""#1 on amazon Prime!"" and tons of people will watch it and it will justify this horrible cycle of producing crap films with bad writing and poor plots.

I was so wrong, I damn near fell asleep at the 30 minute. The fact that this movie is almost 2 hours long is Laughable!!.Stuff wrong with this movie:Number 1, why tf is Lauren London in this movie? Don't get me wrong I love Lauren but I'm sorry, she is an atrocious actress and this goes all the way to ATL back in 06 with T. I. I see why the movie killed her character literally 15 minutes in the movie. Number 2, the acting was kinda terrible, terrible dialogue, they rarely ever communicate with each other. They do but barley like I said. You have to have good dialogue and good acting if you want a movie to be good. They had neither. There was no story line also. Whoever made this movie should be ashamed of themselves. Why did my man Michael B Jordan even thought of being in this movie. Speaking of him, the movie at the end had me dead confused of his characters death. They have a funeral but he ends up surviving despite being on the bottom of the river.

There are currently NO female Navy Seals, much less a team lead reasonably high officer. Her character was pure Hollywood to be able to say they added a black woman. Every time she was on screen, it took me out of the movie and reminded me that ""politically correct"" was more important than a good movie.

187,CryptoGuy,Buckle Up for a Mediocre Ride,3,3 May 2021,"Overall, I found Without Remorse disappointing. While a mediocre action film that was mildly entertaining, this was not by any imagination an adaptation of Tom Clancy's Without Remorse.Probably one of Clancy's finest books, Sheridan and Staples manage to shred anything remotely close to the novel. Rather than a realistic portrayal of a man filled with rage and bent on revenge as he walks the tightrope between self-destruction and duty, we get a stylized military version of John Wick.Don't get me wrong, I love the John Wick movies. They're entertaining fun not to take too seriously. Without Remorse (the movie) hits those same notes. But that's not why Clancy fans have waited decades to see this story come to the screen.But if this movie hits the same John Wick notes, then why is it mildly entertaining? The film takes itself seriously, and it is hard to accept. Not too mention some questionable choices from the writers and director that are just hard to swallow.Poor logistical choices for locations, ridiculous military representations that make Godzilla movies seem like Pentagon training videos, poor casting, and a Swiss cheese script keep Without Remorse from being memorable.Stefano Sollima was absolutely the wrong director for this project. Based solely on his work on Sicario: Day of the Soldado, the acceptable sequel to Sicario, Sollima is a quasi cohort for Sheridan. But Sollima lacks the sophistication to truly tell a compelling story and directs this picture as a Sheridan lapdog instead. Frankly, Sollima stinks and should stick to television.Tyler Sheridan approached the adaptation with a bug gnawing an idea in the back of his head. He's currently developing a television series about the first female Navy Seal. Obviously a fantasy piece that's already been done with G. I. Jane, Sheridan believes he can put a new spin on the idea. Here he tests the waters with Without Remorse, and the water is cold.Karen Greer, played by Jodie Turner-Smith, is a one-dimensional piece of wood. And Turner-Smith has as much range as a squirt gun. Not too mention she doesn't come close to the type of woman that could prevail as a Navy Seal. A miss by all accounts.Jordan as the lead John Clark managed to breathe as much life into a dead-eyed version of the character from the book he could muster. Frankly, the writers and director set him up for failure, but he somehow still came out unscathed.Without Remorse is filled with implausible action sequences, a plot we've seen a million times, stiff acting, and a predictable ending that doesn't even try.

Those issues aside, the film was badly paced; the dialogue scenes felt too slow while the action scenes felt boring and there was a lack of build-up to both.

208,JoelAlexanderr,A meh action thriller with a typically fantastic Michael B. Jordan at the fore,5,8 May 2021,"While I don't think that TOM CLANCY'S WITHOUT REMORSE is near as horrible as some people are claiming it is, it still fails to present anything too memorable or interesting other than a typically stellar lead performance from Michael B. Jordan. I would go as far as saying that without Jordan's charisma, this movie would have been difficult to sit through and damn near irredeemable. Fortunately, Jordan's performance and some well-shot and suspenseful action scenes make this a decently watchable Tom Clancy adaptation, even though it ends up being little else.This film is at its best when it focuses on the revenge aspect of the story, in which Jordan must find his wife's killer and get justice. The part of this movie that falls flat in every respect is the government espionage and foreign relations part of the story, which feels meant for Cold War America and is not relevant or interesting to today's audience. The movie manages to overfocus on this aspect of the story, even though it adds nothing to the intrigue and doesn't leave the audience with any feelings about the governments that it comments on. Jordan's character also becomes very wooden in the second half as a result of this, and all of the trauma which made his character worth following in the first place is stripped away.This movie is definitely not bad, but it isn't something I will remember in a week either.

The ""revenge"" tale has just been overdone, so it ends up being a just okay film all around.To me the selling point of the movie was Michael B Jordans performance, and while it isn't Oscar worthy, it still manages to be captivating and exciting. He brings a lot of emotion to the character of John Kelly, and you truly see the pain and anger in his eyes. The actual plot though is something we have seen a million times before, the writing is average, nothing memorable. The villain is pretty predictable and I think most of the audience has seen the cliche quite a few times before.

For subjecting an already traumatized public to this collection of pixelized garbage. This silly shoot'em-up deserves to be taken out back, shot (without remorse) and buried in an anonymous plot, never to be mentioned again ... or quarantined forever in Yucca Mountain along with all other radioactive waste.Re the ""movie"": There wasn't a lot of character development or laying the premise for a good story. Scratch that. There was none. Plot holes are abundant and the story does not follow in most instances. It would have behooved the writers to have read some real life accounts of spies and covert action before contriving a clearly comically simple but hackneyed revenge plot using characters out of a novel they clearly did not bother to read. Clancy would by no means win any literature awards but at least he usually got the technical and operational details right, usually to a fault. This is by far the worst adaptation of any Tom Clancy novel. The acting by most of the cast is wooden and phoned in. It's sad the only ""Guy"" with any real convincing portrayal is the villain. Throughout the movie you'll be going - What?? Why??? How??? It really is that bad. It's like a bad Avengers movie met Get Smart on a 007 set.Unless action IS the plot - eg The Raid, Extraction... Action and violence should be used sparingly and to further the plot of the movie. There should also be some sense and purpose to the action sequences. This movie - fuggeddaboutit.For example.

And then jumping out and promptly EXPECTING to get arrested. What would you do with any info gained from that theatrical exercise in futility? Wait till the end of the prison sentence to act upon it? This is the type of plan an experienced SEAL would hatch? One that depends on the police pulling over a diplomatic vehicle?? Why would a nearly empty plane be operating with the interior lights on, when even full passenger planes have their lights dimmed? Why was the first thought of a team that's fully geared up with parachutes and about to HAHO out of such a plane decide : No!! We're going to go down with the plane rather than jump, especially when a missile strikes the plane? Who thinks that two black team members can easily blend in covertly into .... *ahem*.. Russia? How easy is it to just ""disappear"" after shooting up a city block... in Russia? And if the team was betrayed from the start and never expected to survive, how is it they made their exfil, presuming their treasonous paymasters were in on the whole plan from the beginning?As a wise former president observed many a year ago: ""Rarely is the question asked: is our children learning?""

To start positive, Jordan fits the role really well. We know he is a fantastic actor, and he shows this more than once. Seeing him kicking some ass is just very entertaining. I really appreciate that they didn't take the action scenes over the top. While I would've like to see some more, I like that they didn't go the John Wick route and just full on assassin mode. This made the action realistic, but awesome. But other than the action scenes, there's not much that kept me entertained. His backstory is solid, but it's mostly the execution of it that really bugged me. For example, we see a fellow trooper of Kelly get run over by a car, but it's so sudden and weird that I almost laughed. Also, the dialog in general was so on the nose. It felt like they wanted him to have an iconic line to remember, but you don't force that. It's all these things combined that made me not invested in his character. This man is going through such a dark part of is life, but it's just the missing pieces that didn't make it feel that way.

Additionally, the other characters are boring, governmental agent-style, which will probably make me forget they even existed. They are also not provided with enough background, to make assumptions, but ""Karen Green"" (Jodie) seems to be an amazing character to be explored in the future (if there is a sequel).However, the emotional context behind the story is fast and when can't really connect, because we don't know nothing about his family... at all. There is no reason to deeply ""mourn"" for his wife's murder. In this beginning you can just feel the intention to convey affection to the motivation of the main character, like John Wick. But, it lacks context or good emotional appeal.Still, the action sequences are amazing! Stefano Sollima and the crew, did an awesome job on building tension around those scenes. It was well-established and perfectly lifelike.Especially the fighting scene in the prison.Finally, with a lazy, worn and habitual plot (USA vs Russia and conspiracy theories), the movie stands out because of the action sequences.

There are more times when his face is deadpan and he looks like he would rather be anywhere else doing anything else than filming this movie than there are times when he looks like a military man focused on his goal.The story itself is pretty poor to be blunt. I admit I have not read the book but I highly doubt it has as many glaring plot holes, inconsistencies as this. I also guarantee you it doesnt feel as cookie cutter as this.I like action movies, I like revenge movies.

Murmansk (which makes sense in terms of the great plot conspiracy, but still oddly raises no eyebrows from those supposedly seasoned operatives themselves). Might as well send them to Beijing or Tokyo to pass them off as locals...And then, they're cruising a Zodiac craft right into the Port of Murmansk while armed to the teeth with very Western assault rifles and plate carriers and so forth.I'm not against bringing more black heroes to the screen, but trying to sell him off as John Kelly/Clarke is quite dumb. Speaking of dumb, John Clarke in the books was extremely intelligent and analytic, and that's just not the vibe I'm getting from Michael B. Jordan, no matter how charismatic he is. He comes off as a yes-sir kind of soldier, not the geopolitical mastermind and analyst.If you can get past all the typical Hollywood stupidity, it's actually pretty straightforward and enjoyable flick for that other, opened eye. Keeps moving, not too many distractions, even despite fairly simple plot that other media has done to death (Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 comes to mind).As for people who are saying it has no place in Tom Clancy universe, I think it has perfect place in it.At least it has the same claustrophobic, paranoid, ""evil men doing evil deeds in the dark of the night""-kind of stuff all his books and previous movies did. That nightmarish, inescapable tone. Perhaps people have wrong nostalgia or need to re-watch some of older movies.

I watched this movie tonight and I have to honestly say that I thought it was a decent flick. I wouldn't go as far as to call it great because it's not. It's predictable in some ways and as soon as I saw a certain actor in their very first scene, I knew they were probably going to be dirty. And that's all I'll say about that. But I enjoyed Michael B. Jordan's work in this film and I feel like he really held it together, as well as Jodie Turner-Smith and Jamie Bell, and much of the action is well handled and looks pretty good. The movie's well shot and the editing isn't super-frenetic. You can see what is happening on screen. The script though is the weakest link. It is ""been there, done that "" in a few regards in at least this adaptation because like I said, there seems to have been changes from Clancy's book. Still wouldn't mind seeing a closer adaptation someday, but as far as the existing film goes, it's fine in my opinion.

MBJ is an incredible actor that played in an average movie and the movie is predictable. So is every other movie you watch. At some point people are tired of seeing blacks play roles they believe were not meant to play, I still remember when Will Smith played James West and the ""crowd went wild"" over the role.Now on to the movie. It does land it the typical unbalance of story meets action. The movie plays more toward the rage and action without giving the viewer an opportunity to know, love and understand the actors, the wife is the prime example.I'll also admit that Jodie Smith struggled in this role, she was about as convincing as Meghan Fox playing Samantha O'Hara is the movie Rogue. The scene where she pulls down John Kelly's finger and makes him submit was both silly and non-convincing.All of this being said, movies take us away and land us in a world of fantasy; movies give us a chance to say ""what if"" and ""I wonder what would happen if"", and this movie did just that.

There's nothing believable or new in the whole film. Clancy's relatives must be short of money (or very greedy) to be associated with this.Michael B Jordan scowls his way through the film and the female SEAL team leader/exposition machine is as miscast an actor as you'll see this year. Nearly all the other characters are cardboard cut outs and imminently forgettable.Several of the action sequences are shot in near darkness making it hard to see what is going on. This was further exacerbated by the fact I cared less and less as the film limped towards its staggeringly obvious conclusion.I spent the last 40 minutes looking at my phone, waiting for the bad guy to be ""revealed"" and then die.None of the action is remotely credible, hiding behind doorways to avoid a suicide vest, driving off a bridge into water without injury etc etc.I can only assume the military consultant was the bloke from the local air soft range and the medical advisor does first aid courses out of the local travel lodge. Both areas are woefully inaccurate in almost every detail.If you're looking for excitement, intrigue, suspense or fresh ideas, then you'll not find any of that here.From the ending, it appears that Amazon were planning this to be a franchise.

There have been plenty of spy movies with so many twists and turns...think the Jason Bourne series...that my head was spinning as I tried to keep up. Characters in revenge movies whose despair at losing their families was so deep it was palpable...

319,thale05,A Movie Too Small for a Tom Clancy Story,4,3 May 2021,"Well, that was pretty disappointing. Pretty much the first disappointing movie I've seen this year so far. ""Without Remorse"" kind of started off nice but as things progressed, it went downhill. For a movie based on the work of the late Tom Clancy, it feels more like a made-for-TV movie of the 80s or 90s than the cerebral blockbuster of ""The Hunt for Red October"".Tom Clancy's work is mostly known for their super technical details and their engaging plots whether it involved espionage or military warfare. I think because of his personal politics and willingness to write about geopolitical matters in his stories, most of his work adapted by Hollywood are toned down for the sake of political correctness. I did a bit of browsing on the synopsis for the original source material to see what was different and here comes the biggest shock of the review: Almost none of what happens in the book is brought to the screen, just about two plot points are adapted.While there is a revenge story in the movie like the book, the main character is not even avenging the same person. Instead of being set in the 70s during Vietnam, a new story is propped against the tense current US-Russian relations in our time. John Kelly (played by Michael B. Jordan) goes on a SEAL mission in Syria to rescue a CIA operative from ISIS captors only to discover the captors are actually Russian military; this is the one part of the movie which felt like it came from a Tom Clancy novel. Months later much of the team members are hunted down in a series of assassinations not unlike the setup to the ""Commando"" movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger. When I was watching, I felt it might be getting somewhere good and sure enough but it really did not.Reading the synopsis of the original book, I think it could have made for a solid movie if trimmed a bit and adapted the right way. But instead of taking risk, the makers hammered it into a John Wick - Commando knock-off without all the fun. I guess you can say they did get somewhat clever when things are described in the third act. But the problem is we're more focused on a revenge story with unrealistic plot developments and a character who barely has any development. There is really not enough I can say about the characters except that they were just there. Michael B. Jordan once again gives a solid performance in the role and continues to be a respected actor in the film industry.The most curious thing is how small the movie seemed whereas Clancy's other adaptations were bigger and felt more epic. I will admit the movie did contain twists and turns but by the end it all seemed very unoriginal and uninspired. Why not adapt the original story into a period piece during Vietnam? We've had a few movies recently do that and they turned out to be successful.This is an example of Hollywood blowing up a potentially engaging plot into a standard spy revenge thriller which is joyless and not interesting to watch. Apparently they're setting up for a sequel based on the Rainbow Six series but after watching this subpar adaptation, my expectations have decreased. I guess it'll be a while before fans will get a proper Tom Clancy Cinematic Universe which will satisfy them and be capable of competing with all the other universes in Hollywood.My Rating: 4/10.",Without Remorse

A predictable story didn't sink this ship though, that was simply one of the many issues with this movie.Another issue was with a runtime of only 1 hour and 49 minutes (including credits), you knew they were going to rush certain things, so it was no surprise when they did.I won't even get to far into the issue with a female SEAL because it is a movie and to date I only know of one female that actually completed SEAL officer screening, but was not picked and had not selected SEAL as her first job choice.If you don't have Prime, don't pay for it unless you're really into MBJ or bored.",Without Remorse

331,brucemiddlemissphotography,A long wait and a real let down,4,30 April 2021,"This is one of my favourite books and I have waited 23 years for a film to finally be made and numerous rumours and false starts. And what a damp squib.So to start with the only resemblance to the look is the loss of a loved one and the names. That's it.From a book that slowly creates characters you care about with complex stories around drug dealers and vietnam to a film with the lamest story ever.Michael B Jordan is OK in the role, he lacks a bit of depth and you never really connect with him. Ritter is a one dimensional character put in there to throw you off the scent.A few people have summed this up as a real budget movie. The action sequences are again ok but mostly filmed in pretty dull locations such as factory's or blocks of flats.The explosions are really quite disappointing. One person is strapped up with 9 blocks of plastic explosive but when it goes off it barely takes out the windows and then they just throw a lot of dust on people to make it look like it was bad.With such great source material and the origin story of John Clark this was very very lame. I feel particularly sorry for Jodie Turner-Smith as she was so miscast it was frightening. I don't think I have seen an actor look so out of place in a role. One minute she is the boss the next she is just another person with a gun not doing much.The ending was so stale, dull and rushed I felt sorry for Guy Pearce who has been a powerhouse of acting.I hate to be one of these people who trump on about the book but I have waited 23 years for a film I have already forgotten about. God knows what they will do with Rainbow six. They really need to step their game up.What concerns me most is that when you have the opportunity to showcase a really good young black actor in a role many associate as white (Willem Defoe) you really want to make sure you deliver to get the naysayers to shut up, but they failed with this one.

Why not just have the snipers take out a few Navy S. E. A. L.s? And speaking of those snipers, why did the CIA send the three worst snipers to this job? Seriously, these guys couldn't hit water aiming from the deck of a floating boat. Collectively they probably take 40 shots and deal one hit to a stomach and one to a leg. The ensuing raid by the Russian S. W. A. T. team or military or whatever they are is a big old disaster too. There's no reasonable way John Kelly should have left that building and the way he got out wasn't at all interesting.Oh, and the scene in which John Kelly ambushes a Russian diplomat, lights the car on fire with gasoline, and then gets into the car to get information, only to pop out and be arrested? Seriously? What if the Russian hadn't said anything? What kind of plan was that?The movie thinks it's just the bees knees with the twists and turns, but it's not. It positions one of the C. I. A. Leads as a questionable presence on the team, expecting the audience to say, ""Yep, he must be in on it!"" but if you've seen any spy movie in the past 100 years, you know that it's immediately a misdirection. This sleight of hand is even more tipped when you cast Guy Pearce in a role that makes him appear trustworthy. It's Guy Pearce, OF COURSE HE'S THE BAD GUY.The last sequence is unbelievably stupid. Kelly has survived and he's taking Pearce hostage, they're driving towards his family's ranch, so Pearce gives up the goods. What's Kelly's endgame? It's to record Pearce confessing to the stuff so that he can be free again and then to kill Pearce to make it look like a suicide, aided by his commanding officer in the S. E. A. L.s. Instead of just driving him to a wooded area and shooting him in the head to make it look like a self-inflicted wound, Kelly drives the SUV off of a bridge, splashing the car into the Potomac. The car sinks, and both men are presumed drowned until it's revealed that the commanding officer was just waiting down there in a diving outfit. I guess she then switches him into the driver's seat, and the media assumes that an SUV just crossed through traffic and launched through a guardrail to the water below is somehow a suicide? Then they go attend John's fake funeral? The latter half of this movie was straight up garbage.The Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, Clear and Present Danger. The 90's had some good Tom Clancy movies. What happened? This feels less like a tentpole film for Michael B. Jordan as Clancy's other non-Jack Ryan character and more like a vehicle that Scott Adkins should have been leading. The script is undeniably stupid and with action that isn't very memorable, it's really hard to recommend this film.",Without Remorse
351,DallahOG,Another movie about A man who lost his family & seeks revenge against the russians but,7,6 May 2021,At least you can believe Michael B. Jordan as A tough military man who wants to avenge his dead pregnant wife so A good choice of the actor not like some other Nobodies. The only thing I ever tried involving Tom Clancy's name was the Splinter Cell games & this movie had absolutely nothing to do with it & I didn't read any of his books so I wasn't comparing the movie to anything while watching it. I don't know about the scene where he burned the russian guy's car then got into it it didn't make sense at all why didn't he ask him about the info he wanted then killed him. I guess the low ratings are because people were expecting something else for some reason but overall it was A good action movie.,Without Remorse
352,jessibi-91956,Without Remorse,6,7 May 2021,"Based on the novel by Tom Clancy, this retro and fairly predictable action thriller does absolutely nothing special but overall gets the job done. The action sequences definitely make the film worth a watch, the fight choreography is crisp and brutal and shot extremely well. The cast is pretty decent but Michael B Jordan delivers a phenomenal and believable performance as John Kelly and is without a doubt the stand out of the film. A lot of things in this film missed the mark for me, I found all the twists extremely predictable and some of the dialogue falls extremely flat. Every other character except Kelly feels underdeveloped and forgettable, I did like the friendship between Kelly and Greer and Turner-Smith was definitely my second favourite actor in the film though that mostly had to do with her great chemistry with Jordan. Overall without remorse is nothing special and misses the mark a couple of times but because of a terrific performance from Jordan and some extremely well shot action scenes I would say its definitely worth a watch.",Without Remorse

Some exciting sequences and moments, guns, explosions, fighting... a very likeable watch. There worse action films. Not having read the book it wasn't really a problem for me. The storyline isn't complicated however, it is slightly weak in the writing. I was able to follow what was going on, but it was a little underwhelming in terms of dialogue. I felt that in places it could have done with a bit more intensity and enthusiasm - some moments were a bit flat unfortunately. Michael B. Jordan delivers a very good performance as he always does!, a well rounded character. Tough exterior but soft interior. The supporting cast too gave good portrayals in their roles and helped raise the weak writing. The mid-credits scene is very good and sets up a sequel very nicely, in turn actually made me change my attitude towards this film...it is a nice ORIGINS story.It won't take your breath away or thrill to the core, but it IS WORTH a watch, it is enjoyable.

If the film was served less intensely, then the main flaws would be an overabundance of annoying clichés.A few points that I don't understand at all: a team of Afro-americans is flying to Murmansk - city where Africans have not been seen since the day of foundation, it is very useful to get lost in the crowd?

408,swordmccloud,Without remorse without the story!,1,3 May 2021,Full disclosure I stopped watching this movie 20 minutes in. Admiral Greer played by a woman was a final straw for me. Look this movie is garbage. The action seems are dumb. The movie shares the name of the book along with the names of a few characters. The book is about him saving a drugged out prostitute and then her getting killed which brings him to a place of full on revenge. Also the story flashes back to his time in Vietnam as snake. This would have been a good story. Instead Amazon and this director did what numerous others have done and had some shady government operators do the main character dirty while killing his team mates and his wife. This movie stole the plot line of numerous movies while stealing the title from Tom Clancey. Shame on them and shame on the estate of Tom clancey selling this without guarantees of following the story. Now I understand the movie knives out even better!,Without Remorse

But what I couldn't have foreseen is how ridiculously unrealistic this would be!Considering how accurate Tom Clancy's novels were, it's an insult to slap Clancy's name on this hot mess! From simple uniform mistakes, to ignoring that police dispatch would run the plates on a foreign diplomatic plates and allow their officers to pull over the vehicle and detain the occupants to the Hollywood staple of suppressors making firearms almost completely silent (even unsurpressed weapons were more quiet than a real suppressor would be) and many other ridiculous scenarios. Throw in the cheesy dialog and over dramatic acting, and this movie seemed more like a satirical comedy, minus the comedy, than a realistic action movie.It would be more entertaining, and productive, to spend nearly 2 hours of your life rearranging the items in your pantry in numerical order by their UPC codes, than wasting that time on this movie!",Without Remorse

415,slam163,"Lazy, unoriginal, predictable",2,30 April 2021,"""Tough good guy seeks revenge after wife and child are murdered"" is a stock movie plot that's probably been done way too many times, but there are ways to make it interesting. This film doesn't. It just delivers a cookie-cutter revenge plot, mixes in a few dozen more well-worn tropes, and plods its way to the end.The big reveal and the twist ending were both predictable from early on and significant parts of the plot didn't make sense. The story itself felt disjointed, lurching from one set-piece action scene to another. It felt very much as if the writers had given up and were just phoning it in.The target audience is clearly people who like guns and soldiers way too much, but the filmmakers then made the baffling decision to throw in a Black female Navy SEAL commander, infuriating and alienating the very demographic that the movie was made for. The character, incidentally, is perhaps the only one in the film who has any kind of screen presence. She's not believable as a military bad-ass, but she is at least interesting to watch, not something that can be said for any other character in the film.The same apathy that infected the writers seems to have spread to most of the actors. Even the often-excellent Guy Pearce looks like a man who's mostly thinking about his paycheck. Jodie Turner-Smith does a capable job with few words and subtle gestures, but she's probably in the wrong movie. Michael B. Jordan just seems numbed, not so much by personal tragedy as by dull writing. He too deserves a better movie: here he delivers a by-the-numbers performance for a by-the-number script.",Without Remorse

418,AVickers,"Take a good book, and throw everything away except the title...",3,1 May 2021,"Take a good book, and throw everything away except the title... (and a few names), then write a dismal movie to replace it.In the book, Kelly's family are killed in a tragic accident; as John starts to rebuild his life he falls in love with a recovering drug-addicted girl, who is recaptured by the gang who held her, and murdered. Kelly becomes a one-man army dedicated to wiping out the drug dealers.... absolutely none of this made the movie. There's a brief scene where John pees on his trousers and soaks himself in booze before pretending to be a drunk homeless guy - a central part of the book, but it just seems weird and out of place in the movie.Setting aside the fact that the movie tells a completely different story to the book - the film itself is not as dreadful as some reviews suggest. The acting is, mostly, decent enough; and whilst the story is weak and contrived, the action kicks along at a decent enough pace. Points awarded for more realistic effects of being shot than most Hollywood films can manage (no-one is running around with half a dozen bullet holes in them, put it that way), and even though this film fails to do Clancy, and especially the book after which it is named, justice; it was good enough to keep me watching to the end.That all said - do yourself a huge favour, and seek out the book: It's SO much better, and deserves to be transferred to the big screen - or even the little screen as a mini-series. Let's hope someone does it justice one day, even if they can't use the name.",Without Remorse

434,perseus71,Over Hyped underwhelming delivery,1,11 July 2021,"There are two major criteria on which this movie will have to be graded and sadly it fails on both.1. HOLLYWOOD MILITARY FARE -
Even by Hollywood standards, this movie performs pretty badly. Compared to the likes of Lone Survivor, Act of Valor or 13 Hours, this stands out like a sad travesty. I don't even want to compare with Zero Dark Thirty as this one would a moth compared to that one. A few points to illustrate its failure on this front. Military tactics, discipline, the comm traffic are even worse than The Expendables. The uniforms are wrong, the military chain of command is ignored. (Does a Lieutenant Commander take order from a CIA Liaison which contradict her own Pentagon Boss?). Another pet peeve, why does a silenced M4A1 sound like an AK47? Where's the fire discipline? When other movies on a lesser budget can deliver on these counts, why couldn't this big budget one? How can one lowly CIA field officer suddenly twirl entire Seal Team around his pinky when the Secretary of Defense does not agree?2. THE TOM CLANCY ANGLE -
Where do I begin? In the book Without Remorse, It's a sole Seal Operator John Kelly who lost his wife to a car accident (Not Russian mercenaries). He picks up a drug mule hitchhiker named Pam whose Pimp objects to her going legit. Kelly is wounded due to a shotgun blast while Pam is tortured and killed. Upon recovery Kelly goes vigilante and kills everyone in the gang. It is ONLY at the very end that CIA agent Bob Ritter comes in and provides a new identity (Clark) to Kelly in exchange for him rescuing a Colonel from enemy interrogation.Needless to say, except for the 2 names John Kelly/ John Clark and Bob Ritter, rest of the plot of this movie has absolutely nothing to do with the book. Even if we look at the plot on it's own merit without Clancy's name, it still struggles to stand on its own. Without revealing too many spoilers, I will say that there's more holes to this plot than a Cheese Grater.",Without Remorse

It got worse from there, just ridiculous plot point and fortuitous things happen so the movie could happen, by the time he extracted a name from a dying Russian that was just so convenient I was pretty much laughing. So what's left, the plot sucks how about the action, it was ok but as I didn't care about any of the characters I didn't really care about what was happening, just extended very long shootouts, improbable action. The obligatory Very slim small no muscle woman beating a highly trained Russian spec ops guy in hand to hand. The completely useless Russian police who can only look up and miss a whole team walking out the front door right in front of them.. just pointless and boring.",Without Remorse

First, they cast a women as a Seal Team commander which to my knowledge has never happened in seal history. Ok I thought I have to expect this anymore but I'll keep watching. Then the conference table scene where a bunch of white men refused a request made by two black Americans. I was like really? I can't be sure what happens further down the line because I had shut it off but I'm sure the white brass was corrupt.

This is a very exciting, fast paced old fashioned military action film. Michael B Jordan was amazing in it - he really has star quality- he is the very definition of a movie star. Whenever he is onscreen you can't take your eyes off him. (Just like in Black Panther and Creed)
Jodie Turner Smith was excellent as well - she played the female SEAL with a lot of heart and guts. YES I know there are no female SEALS IRL but she was very believable in the films world. Guy Pearce was a little overly melodramatic as the corrupt Secretary of Defense but he got the job done.There were several truly amazing set pieces in this such as the plane crash over the Baltic Sea and then the final gunfight in Russia through the abandoned buildings.I never read the book but my mom did and she said a lot was different but what she felt some people were mad about was that John in the book was white and they cast a black actor to play him here.

The storyline was completely changed, made to be more PC, which is somewhat understandable but could have been done in a much less blatant manner. Describing a small unit action, the element was immediately taken over by a non-participant and then was further disrupted when a subordinate suddenly directs the team leader as to actions.

I'm glad Tom Clancy is no longer alive to see what they did to one of his great stories. The young man who plays ""John Kelly/Clark"" is a good actor who I have seen in several roles. I like his talent. There were some other good actors in the movie not including Guy Pearce. First problem the story does not resemble the book which was an outstanding idea. Second John Clark has been in so many of the film adaptations and in the Clancy novels as a white male that I found it a little distracting to now have a younger black man in the role. I think he would have been outstanding in the role of Greer. Greer was horribly cast in this movie and I won't go into the whole a woman as a navy seal and team commander. Hollywood attempting to tell everyone that a woman can do everything a man can do, but hey men can't do everything that women do. I know Hollywood won't be happy until men are playing the role of expectant mothers. I don't even want to think about that!

This is basically the John Wick of what I'm hoping will be the ""Clancyverse"".This movie is honestly amazing for a direct to streaming movie, especially one released during a pandemic, the production values here are great and the action is great too with a good variety of action set pieces, scenarios and locations. Furthermore, the action choreography here is top tier and if you're an action junkie you will love this movie.The type of action and locations present here have much more in common with Tom Clancy video games, especially splinter cell, rather than other Tom Clancy movies (which are all Jack Ryan), in fact this movie reminds me a lot of the Tom Clancy game Splinter Cell: Blacklist which I honestly loved since I always wanted a splinter cell movie and this is the closest thing so far.I get that a lot of people were expecting an good adaptation of the book, which I have not read, but this doesn't seem to be accurate to the source material but I don't think it tries to either, and that's fine by me since its a great movie regardless, this is an action movie and not a political thriller like jack ryan, the plot here won't blow your mind but that's not the point of this movie, the plot of john wick or any 80s action movie won't blow your mind either because that is not the point of these movies, the point of this movie is to be a fun action packed thrill ride and it succeeds very well at this, it retains the themes and aesthetical experience of Tom Clancy and I personally think that's enough to give it the Tom Clancy title.

The story is weak and makes little sense.Plot holes you can drive a truck through.Average acting might be forgiven because of the woeful script.There's so much wrong with this movie it really was insulting to watch.Kelly is shot in both shoulders and in the abdomen, but when he takes his top off before the prison fight he doesn't have a scar on him. He has limp that comes and goes throughout the film.Tom Clancy must be spinning in his grave.

Really interesting source material but likely a fairly high budget movie if it followed the book.I was enthusiastic to see MBJ as Clark and a modern re-imagining of the source material.

Certainly won't be surprised if this is the one and only in this franchise.

Jordan does a great job during the intense parts, but the toned-down bits had me scratching my head trying to figure out if it was bad writing, acting, or both.My favorite part was when their jet was shot down by an enemy fighter, and they're like, ""I'm beginning to think us getting blown up wasn't a coincidence...""

Not only is the actress is from the United Kingdom, there are many qualified female native born Americans that could have been chosen to play this role. It is disappointing to see so many actors from the United Kingdom portraying U. S. citizens in movies instead of casting real Americans which is providing jobs from our own.

This is just another attempt at virtual signaling by Hollywood by race swapping John Clark.The movie tease that it will go from Without Remorse to Rainbow Six.

611,danand-39728,Flavor of the day,2,1 May 2021,"First of all if you are a Tom Clancy fan, this film is nothing like the book. The major problem with this and a lot of other films seems to be that the casting director either has not read the book or does not care about staying true to the books author and casts actors who are popular at that given moment (just to sell the movie).Next if a movie like this one is so different from the story line, they should not be allowed to use the books title and character names, in this and many other movies even stating ""based on the novel"" is a stretch.So to review - this story has very little in common with the novel (which I feel was one of the best in the Jack Ryan series) and Michael B. Jordan is not John Clark.However the film was a well acted action film, if they hadn't called it Without Remorse and the main character was not John Clark I would have given it a much higher rating.",Without Remorse

It was very obvious that he did not get enough training from Seal operators. Or T/A.

Same thing with the leading lady she tried to playing a bad ass, not really hitting the mark, not even close. The her fighting skills and movement not even close to an operator. More tactical training needed. In this woke attempt to take the leap to making her an operator. A 90 lbs women it's nothing even close. BTW why didn't they have over watch on the building. No aerial support for surveillance. Even a small drone which seals use in locations they can't have high altitude UAV. Seals bring home their dead.

However, this line was never really addressed. The protagonist simply worked through the issues. And frankly, simply returning to introduce a new unit. WEAK attempt at laying foundation for a sequel.However, I appreciated the element of connection between characters under stress. I just wish they had spent more time building this aspect (such as in Saving Private Ryan, Fury, or similar advancement in character connection).

Lets get to the most glaringly stupid things in the movie out of the way before I talk about the horrendous acting and other parts. The movie is nothing but a rip off of about 5 different movies. Just jump on Amazon/Netflix and watch the following: The Peacemaker, Safe House, Shooter, Clear and Present Danger, and a Man Apart and youll have this movie in a nutshell. And if you want to see better Navy SEAL movie just watch Walhbergs' Lone Survivor. The storyline is a basic ripoff: Rogue US Officials at the top, misjudging a CIA operative, SEAL team goes in, is set up, and the rest is a revenge movie. Next Navy SEAL training is tough...really tough. So they decided to cast MB Jordan as the hulking Navy SEAL with the muscle body and jiu jitsu moves to go with it, but cast a 110 pound soaking wet anorexic (probably a model cause she had the looks) as his Seal Team Commander. Sorry but no 110 pound woman has the upper body strength to get through Seal training nor lead a SEAL team. There is probably a woman out there that could actually make SEALs but the one cast? NOPE...not on your life. Horrible casting. She even destroys an FSB Special Forces Soldier with her not so handy moves (not much fighting choreography) and then tells MBJ she had to go with the knife because her ""gun"" jammed. ""Gun?"" In other words the script writer was never in the military and didnt consult with anyone about correct military terminology/lingo. The script was just horrendous along with very bad acting. There were so many miscast people in this movie that you gotta wonder how so many casting agents were owed a favor. The Direction was equally terrible. MBJ uses his knife to take down the enemy and never retrieves the tactical knife. Some clandestine mission: I can just hear it in Russian ""Hey look mom a knife. Looks like the one that US Navy SEALs use."" Also the Uniforms were not consistent. And the Commander had on too many ribbons for a LTC. The acting was so bad. Mostly due to the juvenile script.

Recently I've enjoyed everything with Michael B Jordan, and Taylor Sheridan is without a doubt one of my favorite writers. As a legit tough guy actor in Jordan, and a screen writer who who crafted the incredible ""Sicario"" movies, I had high expectations. Thankfully I'm not an overly critical viewer looking at literature or military inaccuracies, just an intelligent individual who likes well written, well shot, well choreographed action films. Certainly not just a throwaway action film, but with the shades of gray that Sheridan writes so well. Those I have recommended this to have enjoyed it as well.

676,danielgray1975,"Varies greatly from the source material, but still a good modern take",7,2 May 2021,"I love the book this movie is very, very loosely based on, so just let me get that out of the way. It's a great read if you ever want to see what might have been had this movie been made decades ago when the source material was still fresh and of the time. Having said that, a vengeance story is always timely, cause who can't see wanting to coldly punish those which kill one's beloved? Nearly the only thing that has stayed the same from the book is the character's name, his history as one of the very best SEALs to come out of the Navy, and that his significant other (he loses a pregnant wife to an accident and then his new girlfriend in the book, and his wife and unborn daughter in the film) is murdered. Of course, this book was written a long while ago, so things would definitely have to be rewritten for current times, and Tyler Sheridan, one of my favorite writer/directors of late does a good job updating the story to present days, admittedly not an easy task (though he did have the help of Will Staples), even if nearly everything else from the book is changed.Michael B. Jordan shows once again why he is one of the best young action stars working today. He is totally believable as a Special Forces operator. On the flip side of the character, he is playful and loving with his wife and believably excited to become a father to a baby girl when his family is taken from him. The military side of his life is winding down to retirement and a new security contractor job on the horizon that will allow him to be close to home with his young family. The actor that plays his wife, Lauren London, was a great choice. She's very lovely and anyone would be believably ripped apart from her loss. When she and her unborn baby are gunned down in cold blood, a switch is turned and Kelly becomes vengeance itself, his only mission to punish those that not only killed his family by deed, but whoever the ""king"" is that ordered their deaths, because this was no ordinary home invasion, it was a professional hit. Tom Clancy quotes John Dryden at the start of his novel, ""Beware the fury of a patient man"", but we never get the slow burn of the book. Given this is a single movie to give Clancy's second most famous character, John Kelly (later known as the legendary Mr. Clark of the CIA and Rainbow Six), his backstory, we can't expect to see the lengths taken in the book to exact his revenge. Perhaps a limited series would have been better, but if the film is successful we will most definitely be seeing either a Rainbow Six TV series or possibly a series of films with these updated characters. The ground work is definitely laid for just that to happen and I believe it is the film's biggest flaw: it's just a setup for what's to come. Many of us have probably played the Rainbow Six games throughout the years, and Amazon is most likely looking to make the books and games based on them a major part of their streaming service's original programming. I can't blame them for that, because they are some of Clancy's best stories. I only wish they had done a series for this particular property so it could have been fleshed out more to the tone of the book. The changes in the characters themselves aren't an issue. They were lucky to get the excellent cast they did. Jodie Turner-Smith as Kelly's team leader, Karen Greer (yes, related to James Greer, his niece) was an excellent choice as she has a definite presence in her every scene. Jamie Bell plays CIA operative Robert Ritter as an extremely unlikable prick whose loyalty is never quite known till the end, and he does so extreme well. The rest of the cast is great as well. Again, I only wish they could have been fleshed out a little more. Clancy wasn't one to spare the details in his writing, and you expect to see that translate to the screen, but that's easier said than done.All in all, most action film fans will enjoy the movie. If you're a fan of the books and this character specifically, the variation from his original backstory may be too much for you. I think the property just wasn't made soon enough to be tied to the book more accurately. They could have made this movie in the early 90s when it was first released, but I understand that was a whole other challenge. I believe they are planning to tie this film in with Amazon's already popular Jack Ryan series. I hope that's the case. That explains why the retcon has to be so severe. The addition of Mr. Clark will be a welcome one in the Jack Ryan universe. It's hard not to like such a great character.",Without Remorse

""Without Remorse"", however, is an utter train wreck of a movie. The novel almost begged for big screen treatment but instead got something worthy of a student film. Not blaming the actors or directors but whoever ""adapted"" this novel should be taken before a virtual firing squad..What should have been a gripping movie with a poignant backstory turned into a mish-mash of pasted up action scenes with very little coherence.

With in minutes it was clear this was not going to be the movie I thought it was going to be, and by the end the consensus was that we had just watched a pretty awful movie. There is almost no plot and what plot there is is the most contrite drivel you could imagine. This is a movie you have seen at least two dozen times and out of those 23 were a better movie that this. The acting is stiff, even from the usually fantastic Michael B Jordan, there is zero character development and you have no investment in how anything turns out. There is literally probably less than 10 minutes of action and what is there is unimaginative and boring. I love action movies and think that even a lot of lower budget poorly made ones at least have some worthwhile parts, but with this movie I can honestly say that there isn't one thing I could point to in this movie that had any entertainment value.

When the second SEAL gets gunned down in his car, the van could not get away in all the traffic. After one, but certainly after two SEAL Team deaths, all the members would have been warned and on alert. In prison they would throw gas to disable the prisoner or hit him w/ taser or non-lethal rounds, not fight him hand to hand. When John goes back to get gear, how in the world does he float the large outboard motor to the surface? If the Russian shot down a spy plane, they would have swarms of recon aircraft, choppers and boats on the crash site but the team just motors away w/o incident. Also, they motor through a busy shipyard w/p anyone noticing. How did Ritter so easily get into Russia? How did John get the SecDef out of the bathroom without being seen - especially since he had 2 bodyguards outside? When the car went over the bridge and hit the water, the airbags certainly would have deployed. No explanation how they held a funeral w/ no body or why the news reports on SecDef's death would reported a suicide when they left him restrained in the passenger's seat.

He & the mention of the Clancy name, made me interested.Typical action/spy pieces have a fictional story in a real-world setting. There are plenty of ethnic Seals out there. Seals are Black, Hispanic, Asian & White. But never has there been a female Seal operator. I'm all for women in any job role. But for the same reason that men & women are competing alongside each other and never against each other in sports, among which the Olympics, there have never been a female Seal operator, nor are there other female Special Forces operators in the USA, nor the world.An alpha-male will beat out an alpha-female in every setting. In MMA/boxing, prime male middle weights would injure a female competitor in the first round. A biological male's body in peak condition, much like a Olympic athlete, will have denser bones, more muscle tissue, less body fat; will therefore sprint faster, jump higher, carry heavier ;yes, apparently men even withstand muzzle feedback better, having increased aim, and more stamina to fire more shots with higher caliber firearms.Just because you are woke, don't agree, find it unfair there are no female special forces, it just doesn't change things. When you get the best of the best physical humans to do work, unless it is the mind, the top 1 percentile physicality will only include men. This is not society disqualifying women. If you take the 50 fastest human sprinters in the world (or even 1 million), they will be men. Please get over it. This is just required for the level of body capability, it is not a statement of women being less valuable. Plenty of stuff women do better than men, just not being a Navy Seal.A 90lbs woman, not even an alpha specimen, will ever outclass a 180lbs elite male soldier in hand to hand combat. She might be smarter, but never quicker or stronger.Elite alpha-females will outclass mediocre men any day of the week for sure. The famed UFC fighter Rhonda Roussey would definitely beat me to a pulp. But if it is her trying to pin a middle-weight boxer or a Seal operator, she wouldn't make it.The pope is not Asian, the British Queen is not black, president Biden is not transsexual, Navy Seals are never women, that js just reality.

The only emotion that was put into it (spoiler ahead) was the murder of John Kelly's pregnant wife ...pretty brutal scene to be honest. Yet that all seemed to be forgotten about and pushed to the side to fit in political agendas and wanting a war ...

Most of the action scenes are easy to follow as the viewer and you understand where the enemy fire is coming from in most scenes.Mediocre: ~ MBJ does the best that he can with the material and time given. As the viewer, you can see early on the psychological pain and trauma the John Kelly (MBJ) goes through. He has resigned himself to the idea that his life only serves to cast revenge on those who are responsible for the murder of his pregnant wife and unborn daughter. This male protagonist archetype is seen on screen quite often, such as Taken, John Wick, etc. That being said, MBJ does try to deliver on the psychological pain (PTSD) his character is feeling. In the final scene, however, that pain is but a fleeting memory and he's ready to renew himself as John Clark. (mmm k)Bad: - Plot armor. As mentioned before, John Kelly has resigned himself to kill and die in his attempt to revenge his murdered pregnant wife. The scenes where he takes on an entire platoon of Russian Soldiers are painful to watch.Often he is getting shot at by soldiers out of frame. He can leisurely walk down the stairs, shooting an AK one-handed while being injured and, to top it all off, is able to unscrew a grenade without tools and craft an IED while getting shot in minimal cover. Best of all, he's able to change clothes to disguise himself as a soldier and stumble his way through the dust to find an ambulance to escape in... Hmm, yeah, that's some TV Movie nonsense right there.Who was this action scene supposed to appeal to? Gamers of the Rainbow Six, or any Tom Clancy title, know that you can't be Rambo in those games.Story: Anti-Russian sentiments foreshadowed but never resolved. Why did the Russians collaborate with the evil Secretary? The military industrial complex needs a big enemy like the Soviet Union to survive? The ending was very disappointing and flat for a Tom Clancy story.Jodie Turner-Smith: #Sorrynotsorry She just isn't believable as a female NAVY Seal. Enough has already been said on the topic in the forum. Also, the lighting in some scenes, like in the airplane, made it difficult to read her character's emotions.I hope Amazon improves the writing of their productions. Action is fine, production value seems high but the writing is comically bad and mediocre.",Without Remorse

The dialog was flat. Not sure if it was bad script or bad acting/ directing, but the characters didn't pull me in. I was not at all offended by a black John Kelly or a female spec ops commander in concept. I just didn't find these portrayals credible.If you wanted to watch Clark's story from Tom Clancy's novels, you will have to wait. This wasn't it in any respect. Given how prominently the tie to Clancy was in the marketing, I think it's quite fair to ding them in this review for disappointing us. If you came here to watch a Tom Clancy story, especially one with as much in it as Clark's story should have, this film was a great disappointment. A four rating is overly generous in that respect.

It has nothing to do with the book's plot or characters, it's not set in the same time period, and I'm pretty sure these people made a generic action movie, but they were afraid that nobody would see it, so they changed the main character's name, slapped poor Tom Clancy's name on it (because Tom won't object to it ever since he stopped needing oxygen) and hoped that people would watch it based on false titling. I hate this movie for that reason. If they had called this movie literally anything else, I would have given it at least 6 stars. It's a 6 star movie, but being labeled as ""Tom Clancy's Without Remorse"", 1 star is too much.

In my opinion it could have been a two hours film where it goes more in depth about the character, the agenda and the friends and foes.They should've hit me up when they wanted to make this film, would've given them some good good ideas, like add some suspense, make the watchers ask questions that would raise eyebrows not only ""why kill his team and his wife and tried to kill him"" but ask ""was killing his team and wife necessary""",Without Remorse

813,briandickie-39038,This is not any relation to a Tom Clancy book of the same title.,2,30 April 2021,"John Clark, or Kelly as the character starts out is a Navy Seal.Admiral Jim Greer's normally played by the superb James Earl Jones is not featured in this, but the characters niece is, who is John Clark's team leader.Jamie Bell, plays Ritter, who we all know is a future corrupt CIA Director of Intelligence.... Maybe he will be good before his corruption in later books, but no, this story has him outed as a villain in the first spoken scenes.Here ends any relation to the Tom Clancy storylines. And my interest in the story wavered further and further as the film progressed.Add in a few action sequences, lots of meaningless jibber jabber to set up a plot line that has descended from retiring seal, to covert ops, although for which agency is strangely lacking. Maybe it's cia, but none of it fits any notion of a military or intelligence structure.Acting: Jamie Bell lacks any depth, motivation and background. The actress playing Greer is to be avoided, basically, a wooden character with presence which isn't utilised at all, seems like a missed opportunity. Michael B Jordan, is limited to silent operative and angry husband and superman, but there is no depth.Just weird.... Thats some of the actions and set peices, bits of floor that fall away, climbing into burning cars to interview suspects, arrests that don't make sense, threats and hostility for show., when Kelly is imprisoned for unknown reasons, no trial, with russian mobsters. The panache of Clancy is nowhere to be seen, what we see is corruption everywhere, action scenes which are just plain non sensical, such as Kelly vs 3 Prision Guards in full riot gear with helmets, shields and batons, you can guess it's never going to be a fair match, Kelly is of course an overwhelming opponent.I honestly couldn't tell you what i detested more about this film.... The acting.... 2/10. The story 1/10. The identity politics, 0/10.Overall, the key to Tom Clancy novels making it well to the screen, is to have some tenet of link back to the books, some have been very faithful, HFROctober, Patriot Games, etc. Some have been weak - SOAFears.... Some have been unfaithful, the recent amazon Jack Ryan shows, but were true to the moral of an Analyst working their way up.... This film, i can only conclude, had the title and character names of some well known Clancy characters, but none of the substance or integrity or story.... Add in an act of war by America on Russian, a Jet Plane crash in which everyone survives with no injuries.... It's just garbage and not fit for the film title and characters names.I feel sorry for the careers that could well be ruined by this film. The only reason why i don't give this film 1/10, is that it's not a home movie, and it gets a 2/10 because to be fair on the cell sequence, the use of water and M B Jordan's physique is impressive.If you decide to watch this.....

The acting is bad, some plot details are beyond absurd, technical details are sloppy, every development is predictable, and some of the action sequences are ridiculous.Back to Clancy.

It is in-fact the embodiment of lost potential. A few tweaks could have potentially seen a Hollywood action hallmark of this era.The movie gets a few things right. The lighting was highly compelling and to my relief, avoided the pitfall of being too dark for too long. The acting performances in some places were on point, and Michelle B Jordan was amazing for almost the entire movie - specially the prison parts. Unpopular opinion - the writing was straight up amazing. Some scenes were brilliantly done, with great twists and a really entertaining story.However, the writers did fall short in a few places. It certainly felt like the writers were caught between choosing what conflict to dedicate a scene to. While the action was compelling done, it was undercut by arguable poor direction. The director seemed to fail in making the non action parts work. The proper closes when the actor should be figuring some things out was missing. The camera placement seemed off and a-lot of really good elements were poorly tied up.The director, Stefano Sollima, could potentially deliver a blockbuster hit if assisted in the non-combat direction.The writer Will Staples was incredible for the most part in writing some jaw dropping moments. However, the screenplay seemed to lack the foresight of a movie. ""They shoot 2 policemen"" could be followed by ""No, we shoot 2 policemen"" even tough the director would not give the scene enough time to shine.Most of the cast failed to disappoint, with great acting performances. Jodie Turner Smith's Karen Greer gave away a bit of momentum with a bland portrayal in he first half.The main flaw of the film came from the combined efforts of the director editor and cinematographer. The direction seemed to lack creativity and perhaps understanding their theme.

She can't even order someone to take a drink without it sounding boring, and almost childish. She has no energy, no emotion, and is easily the weakest part of an already weak movie. Her agent must be legendary to get her acting roles after this. There was more emotion in the dead behind the eyes twins in ""Valerian."" Jamie Bell and Guy Pierce are underutilized, and one dimensional. The action pieces are boring, predictable, and at times unbelievably stupid. Like setting a Russian Ambassador's car on fire, and then climbing in it to talk. Even the ending and ""twist"" are predictable. It takes a well thought out Tom Clancy book, and makes it a modern Blaxploitation revenge flick set against a minor political backdrop. Actually I wish it was blaxploitation, it might have been better with Rudy Ray Moore.",Without Remorse

The truth is it is very cleverly written and trys to educate people in a very subtle way. It provides the regular dose of action with good right kind of musical score.John slowly slowly realises how is just a pawn in a game that is much bigger than him. How wars are just business done by people sitting at the top. The idea of patriotism is sold to young man so that they can be used in this game . Taylor Sheridan does a good job but at the same time he is careful about not exposing too much of the truth so that people do not get offended.War has always been a racket. It always will be. Americans loves war and sooner or later they will learn that its not like how its in the movies.

He then finds solace in the arms of a hitchhiker who turns out to be a junkie used by her dealers/pimps as a mule/sexual party favor for their narcotics customers. She's one of many girls used to this end, threatened with death if they run away, but she gets free. Kelly falls in love, only to have her ripped away when the drug-slinging pimps find, abduct and execute her after shooting him up too.Once he recovers, the vengeance begins, all while running a covert op into Vietnam with Marine Force Recon (the book takes place towards the end of the Vietnam conflict).This was a decent action film, but it could have been just as good without using character names from Mr. Clancy's works.

If so, that would mean all the team members live in the same general area- yet no reports of the prior 2 hits? Also, a guy is stuck in traffic, when suddenly he's whacked by 4 guys in a van who are then able to speed off?Plus, I still have no idea how he made it to the surface when it was clear the plane was plummeting to the bottom of the Berents Sea.All in all- lots of action, and gunplay with things getting blown up.

He only needed to sell them two words: ""Without Remorse"", and the names of five characters.What brilliant writer came up with the idea for this to be a CIA designed conspiracy? How original! I'll bet everyone was surprised at the end when Guy Pearce turned out to be the villain!In case you never read the REAL Without Remorse story, this movie will not suffice as a shortcut in your book reading club! You will just have to read the book. (Careful though, the paperback version weighs in at about 8 pounds!) Well worth the time though. It is one of my favorite books ever.I think the movie had lots of potential if they had just modernized the original story. Baltimore is still full of crime, drugs and prostitution which play a central role in Kelly becoming Clark. Jordan could have been a great Clark with the right military advisors on set. However, things just didn't look or sound right in any of the action sequences.And Greer? Please! I'm all for a female Navy Seal. I actually enjoyed the flick ""GI Jane"". However, they needed to pick an actress who looked more than 15 years old and weighed more than a buck 25.Overall, not very believable movie even if it didn't have the name of a famous book that it didn't resemble in the slightest.As for those giving this movie 8's and 10's?

So, I cannot comment on its adaptation, by I trust other reviews.That being said, the storyline is not particularly engaging.The cast is composed 80% by British actors who, except for Jamie Bell, haven't been good at making an American accent - especially Jodie Turner Smith -, making their ""American"" characters not very American.Directing was okay, but I find that Sollima did a better job with Sicario: Day of the Soldado and Suburra.The screenplay didn't seem a work of Taylor Sheridan whatsoever. If you're familiar with Sheridan's works (Sicarios, Hell or High Water, Wind River and Yellowstone) and his style of plot, dialogue and storytelling, you'll realize this is a whole different thing - for the worse. It could be because it was his first written assignment and it didn't come from his heart like the mentioned works - it wasn't HIS story. I hope he'll come back with Those Who Wish Me Dead.Overall, it's a standard action-loaded movie as it could be Run All Night, Non-Stop or any other related film.

They deviate so much, in fact, that the movie really should have disassociated from the name Clancy and his book.Bit of a spoiler alert - an aspect that makes the book successful is the character development of the female love interest. This doesn't happen in the movie. Since they dispose of the revenge motive so quickly in the beginning I can only assume having her be pregnant was a device to try and engender the empathy and connection that was developed over many pages in the book. It didn't work. This thin set-up - which is blunt, uninteresting, haphazard, and clumsy - segues into what can only be described as a series of theme-park-like scenes. The story is just incredibly thin, fatiguing, and boring.Huge fan of Michael B Jordan. He carries whatever caricature of a movie this is ultimately. I suppose some of the other casting degrades the minimum required authenticity for a movie like this. Regardless, I just couldn't get over how poor the screenplay was; adding insult to injury, given the original book served as such a great blueprint for a successful film.

If Cam Gigandet was to assume the role of Lieutenant-Commander the movie could have been watchable at the very least. But no, both Gigandet and Mitchell, for whom I had big expectations in this movie were gunned down and driven over barely 15 minutes into the film, so we had to put up with Jodie till the end. Moving on, all of the action sequences and combat were just...so average. It's not that the movie is plain bad, it's just average where it should have been excellent. Storytelling seems so rushed and forced, and the movies twist does little to help that. Still, lemme pick out the bright spots: + Jordans' performance deserves praise, + Russian uniforms, weapons and equipment is for the most part very accurate, I was stunned to the levels of detail shown at some parts, especially when showing Russian MPs at Murmansk. - And that's unfortunately pretty much it.",Without Remorse

To make ANYONE believe this op had ANY chance of succeeding, the CIA guy would have ensured only white troops were used. Again, a sop to the ticket buying public and to promote black action actors. An excellent thought...but NOT in this context.3) Professionals don't kill families, even if you're trying to start a war. The first two killed, the bad guys waited until they were alone before killing them, families weren't touched. Again, an egregious ploy to drive ticket sales.4) It was said earlier in the script that Kelly was not expected to live (and if you're going to change EVERYTHING else, why not change the chief character's name. A black man with an Irish name is not likely). Where he was wounded it would have taken AT LEAST 6 MONTHS for him to heal and rehab.

Plot holes all over and bad bad writing, bad bad dialogues and some terrible acting here and there.Personally I do not regret watching though, as I think Michael B. Jordan is a great actor. This film just wasn't the best of his career. Overall cinematography is great and action scenes are ok too.

I turned on this movie and the first 10 minutes shows a Navy SEAL team with a 90 lb black woman as the SEAL teams commanding officer in the field! I don't care if she's black, white, purple, green, blue, whatever, this ridiculous looking scenario with Navy SEAL military equipment on this woman's body looking silly and giant compared to her frame just to make some kind of social engineering statement?!? Then it switches to the United States in the Pentagon where it finally shows her in a Navy SEAL uniform with ribbons on her chest and the seal insignia that very few men have the mental and physical capability to earn, much less a 90 lb woman unless you change what it means to be a seal and at that point the whole intriguing, glorious excellence and dedication of these men who pushed their God-given strength and dedication to the limits and beyond with the desire to protect the men , women and children of this nation from Evil tyrants who would force their will upon Americans, is belittled and lost. There is one scene where this woman goes face to face with the antagonist, in a scene where she is supposed to be popping up her chest and looking big and bad to threaten this man who is doing things that could cast her men in a bad light. That was one of the most silly, ridiculous scenes I've ever encountered in a Bee movie much less a movie that's been built up as much as this one has. I had to turn the TV off at that point because I was so embarrassed for this poor actress who I'm sure could do great in a role as an actual woman, in the strength of righteous womanhood. Movie makers, you've not only lost your connection to the people of this nation, you've lost your connection to reality as God designed it, obviously, clearly and without question.

If you want to make skits for yourself all day and all night where guys become female impregnated aliens, do it, but leave us out of it and please get some people to make movies again that have excellent righteousness versus evil thematic elements, where men reveal the reason for and purpose for their being, bearing Authority and strength for the blessing and protection of others, not some made up morality and reality where dogs are supposed to marry cats and a lion can declare himself an elephant legally.",Without Remorse

The writer then flipped randomly to the middle of the book and read a page where Kelly disguises himself as a homeless drunk. Then, a quick jump to the last page to discover the hero being recruited by the CIA.""Oh, I read it cover to cover. I thought it was fantastic,"" I'm sure they said, just before setting to writing this tripe.From front to back, this movie was a missed opportunity. They had Michael B. Jordan, Jodie Turner-Smith, Guy Pearce, Jamie Bell, Brett Gelman (for some reason), a Tom Clancy source material, and the crowd draw of the Ryanverse. The tools were all there!But instead of focusing on a unique character and telling an original story, they threw all of Clancy's material away. The studio and the producers settled for a mashup of John Wick, The Equalizer, and The Professional packed into a stock, unmodified action vehicle.Badass boy loves girl. Trained killers murder girl, wound boy. Boy seeks out revenge. Boy, he didn't change much. (Boy teases sequel)There are myriad nuances and vignettes that dirty book-readers (like myself) might have hoped for in this film. None appear. There are always going to be cuts and updates, I understand. What I can't understand is that there is one glaringly obvious question that this movie never even reaches for.Why is John Clark who he is?This is the sixth Jack Ryanverse movie to be released (coincidentally, this was the sixth Jack Ryanverse book as well). Prior to this, we've only glimpsed John Clark-a covert military operative who shows up just before people start dying. We've seen him ready to murder Jack Ryan himself in cold blood based on a phone call. We've seen him accept black-ops assignments with deep moral ambiguity. We've witnessed John Clark kill-not in a gunfight-but murder for anything from acting above the law to simply being in the wrong place wearing the wrong uniform.Of course we want to know his back story! What happened to this guy? What skeletons hang in his closet? Why does he follow orders without question? How did he become this thoughtful professional who does the government's dirtiest work by day and goes to sleep at night without remorse?I'm sorry to report that the movie does not trouble itself with such questions.Instead, the film manufactures another predictable master-of-all-trades hero surrounded by people begging for his leadership. On that, my personal favorite in the film is an airplane scene where the trained, uniformed military pilot in the cockpit yells that they've been missile-locked. Sitting in coach, Kelly shouts authoritatively to the pilot to take evasive maneuvers. Whatever would that pilot have done without him?We're left with a John Clark that is indistinguishable from any other action protagonist. There's no obstacle he can't think or shoot around. There's no solution he would discover that we wouldn't agree with. He's as plain and as safe as Amazon's Jack Ryan (also made generic beyond recognition), and the universe was not begging for him.In the end, this entire film felt like a half-hearted origin story produced as a compromise before Amazon can advance things into the more recognizable Rainbow Six franchise. I'm sure they're excited for that, as we know, movies based on video games are always top notch....Admittedly, I've been following this film's development for a decade. I really thought the story would make for a unique heroic tale. I'm not really surprised that the years of compromises, changing hands, and trade-offs sanded it down to complete dullness.If you pick up a book every so often, I highly recommend giving Clancy's novel a try.

I would say this isn't even a Clancy story if not for the name.But set that aside. My main problem is the poor acting of Jodie Turner-Smith also known for ""Queen & Slim"".

Other than the title and a few character names, the plot does not do justice to the book. Sadly, what viewers are being robbed of is, the book explores Clark's tragically dark past, Pam's struggles, and how he ultimately becomes Clark and the movie does not. As Clark avenges Pam's death alone in the book by stalking Pam's killers, the movie leaps to some weird USA vs Russia plot and misses the boat all together.

If it's a militarily accurate movie you're after, it ain't that. It's more in the same vein of Jack Ryan season 2, full of plot holes and characters reaching too far to get a conclusion.

This just establishes the main plot. Michael B hates this other guy in his group while working in the military and he loves his wife who is about to have a baby. This part is actually much better than the whole movie. There is some averagely interesting action sequences and just goes at a very regular pace.The rest of the movie:
After seeing the trailer I was continuously waiting for that jail fight scene. I thought there would be a whole build up but no. I was totally wrong. The jail fight was just stupid and had nothing to do with the story. The whole story after Michael's wife dies is tiresome. We want to see what happens but the fricking story doesn't even move forward. There was random events happening just to continue this story but truly it didn't. The screenplay was wayyy too slow. The only thing that was bearable was the wife emotion they put and that was carried by Michael B by himself.To sum it all up the story lacks gripping narration and we feel as if the story doesn't move forward.

Not a Tom Clancy story.,2,30 April 2021,"I loved Tom Clancy books and movies growing up and I always wanted them to make Without Remorse into a movie since the book was so good. I was thoroughly disappointed. The only commonality are some of the characters and the title. They could have just changed the character names and the title and not claim this to be a Tom Clancy film. Either stick with the plot of the books and do them justice or don't claim to do a Tom Clancy film. The plot they did use instead was stale and not what I would expect for a major release. It was more in the direct to DVD league.It also seems like they did not have very good technical advisors... or geographers. The opening scene takes place in a landlocked city and yet Kelly and his team infiltrate via water. The uniforms are also very inconsistent... Greer is wearing a commanders cap in at least one place which is different than what her rank would be. Since the writers took so much liberty with realism, they just wrote her in as a SEAL instead of a more plausible role like being some sort of subject matter expert attached to Kelly's team. I'm not one to dismiss the idea that there are women out there capable of becoming Navy SEALs, but I would expect the to be built like a crossfit games winner instead of the stereotypical model. I know this comes off as nitpicking, but the filmmakers should know their audience. Tom Clancy's books and previous films were always very detailed and realistic and this film was far from that.The one positive part of the film was Michael B. Jordan's performance and the only reason I gave this any stars. I was excited to see him in the role when it was announced. He did well with what he had to work with. It is a real shame.

Other than that it was miserable. I guess just focus on remaking great old movies and destroying those. At least nobody will get their hopes up that they will be any good.",Without Remorse

If this was just an action movie I wouldn't care about the race/gender of the characters but it's based on one of my favourite books and if it was a reversal (a white actor playing the role of a black character from an adapted book or comic) there would be an outcry.Then there's the fact the the period is wrong, as Clark served in Vietnam not the Middle east and they deleted James Greer completely.If this was just a brainless action film I'd give it four stars but the things I mentioned above plus the butchering of the source material brings it down to a 1.",Without Remorse

Only the John Clark character and the title resemble the Tom Clancy novel.So disappointed.While we have seen and expected some deviation from Tom Clancy novels to film with his complex story lines. This completely rewrites the novel.Even giving some latitude of modernization bringing John Clark being a combat veteran in Syria vs Vietnam.Creating and adding unrealistic characters for the sake of political agendas further destroys the plot.Creating a nonexistant Admiral Greer relative as a long operating special warfare Lt. Commander was so far from believable to be insulting.

Simple, straight forward, and with just few enough twist so you can say ""i knew it"" without having to go soul searching for the meaning of life/death. 4. Action scenes were realistic and full of tension. (This is not a marvel, transformer, justice league type of action movie.) It is however a glimpse at a man who had everything (what most grown men want: wife, home, children, job ) stripped from him brutally and his fight to figure out the truth behind it all. I think Micheal B. Jordan played the role well he was cold detached and focused. He never faltered from his character never tried to force a laugh or a whimsical moment with a catchy one-liner just to please a softer/younger audience. 5.

But this is a very entertaining and exhilarating watch regardless. Michael B. Jordan's performance was outstanding, the action scenes were executed perfectly and the plot overall was incredible. I was actually tired when I started watching this film and was on the verge of going to sleep but when I watched the first half an hour I was hooked.",Without Remorse

The script could have been better, but the action sequences were phenomenal in my opinion. I was a HUGE fan of the game Splinter Cell, and im still hopeful that it may come to the big screen, but who knows.

I understand they can't use the real plot for Clancy, Vince flynn books etc. Because the plots are too complex and actually interesting for the average movie watcher to understand. However the plot for without remorse was so far fetched I had to take a moment to process if this was a satire. To think a navy seal could just murder a foreign dignitary at the airport in front of everyone and one.. not be shot and two just not have immense press coverage and absolutely zero chance of being released from jail for a goose chase. But the worst thing of all in this movie is how the CIA is portrayed. Tom Clancy made his fortune off of writing about the CIA.. has anyone heard of jack ryan? How could they make the CIA look so incompetent that they wouldn't realize a plot to stage a war for Christ's sake!? The CIA director was horrendous and that agent was so shameful. Don't you think that the CIA people would know more about espionage than a Navy SEAL..? After all it is there jobs! There was no communication between the cia and the president or any government about a literal war with Russia lol.. What do you think the CIA's job is?? To say this is tied in with jack Ryan is embarrassing. Yeah of course the navy seals are deployed into Russia without anyone having to talk to the president..but I guess that's why this is a basic streaming movie and not an HBO original or something.. they couldn't afford any writers that knew jack s*** about foreign policy or espionage and just hoped people would like the action.

Thin script which created thin characters. I typically really enjoy Michael B. Jordan but his supporting cast was a huge disappointment.

1314,danielafrisk,"A slick, yet mostly empty, hull of a movie adrift in the sea of the modern world.",3,8 May 2021,"It was bound to be paradoxical: Tom Clancy's often conservative views on the world, and the modern (Hollywood) era's quest to right some of the previous wrongs imposed on parts of the American population. My hat off to the writers, producers, and director for giving it a go. However, they seemed to have gotten bored after that initial meeting, and left the bridge to go do something else.First off, we have the overall themes, which start out strong, and then plummet to Earth like a Jet-plane with both engines on fire. In this adaptation of Tom Clancy's book, the main protagonist John Kelly/John Clark (Michael B. Jordan) has morphed from his literary Caucasian origins to an African-American exterior persona. To spike it up further, his SEAL superior (Jodie Turner-Smith) is a woman. The two have a discussion marked by recent times, when they talk about how they fought for ""what America COULD be"". Towards the end, the main antagonist also talks about how the two halfs of America are busy fighting each other. This is an interesting take, and in my view an actually productive way to try to make amends, to offer hope, and to heal some wounds. It also provides African-Americans and women with some positive role-models (the US recently opened up service in Special Operations Forces to women, and so it is not ""far-fetched"" as some have commented). In my view, Turner-Smith brings a quiet but smoldering take to her character, and there is no trace of that (unfortunate but common) anxiety which for some reason is usually chosen to be portrayed by characters who happen to be women in male-dominated areas. She pulls it off, and gets just the right amount of time to build her character and further the (theoretical) plot.Having dealt with these internal points, the Hollywood crew then moves on to the exterior ones. In a classic, yet contemporary move, it pits the US against Russia in (at first glance) a pretty blunt way. There are assassinations, insertions, planes shot down, and the two powers seem to be on the brink of war, which it turns out, was the whole idea all along. Because, you know, just like Hitler always said, one needs an external foe to rally against. The brave Special Ops and Intelligence people on both sides have just been used as pawns by shady parts of the US Establishment, in an effort to... Make America Great Again? Sort of. Anyhow, our fearless heroes quickly make use of some stratagems and turn the tide against their real foe.Russia's actual role in the plot is never quite clarified, with the FSB officer responsible for the murder of Kelly's wife and child supposedly being a CIA man all along, and somehow prepared to blow himself up to further the grand scheme of his mysterious master. Yet, in his final moments, his requiem consists of explaining to Kelly how they´re both pawns, which would belie his belief in the value of the sought endgame, and just make him suicidal (and just like the audience at this point, thoroughly confused about what the point is all about).Once everything is neatly wrapped up, a mid-credit scene shows our protagonist talking to the new CIA Director (a very sullen and intense Jamie Bell, who brings 20 years of the losing effects of a War on Terror alive in his character in a marvelous way) about forming a new unit. Suddenly, we're given the prospect of another Tom Clancy adaptation - Rainbow Six. Our protagonist explains that he wants to start a ""Multi-National Counter-Terrorist Unit, so that this may never happen again."" Exactly how a multi-national CT unit consisting of a bunch of door-kickers is supposed to counter high-ranking, power-mad domestic politicians from nefarious scheming is beyond anyone's grasp at this point. Even Michel B. Jordan seems tired from jumping to so many conclusions and riding along the plot-hole pockered way. Jamie Bell seems equally confused, and at this point I wondered if his sullen take on his character wasn't due in part to some forced-upon method acting in the form of depression by the onset of trying to bring something to this movie, in the same way as his on screen alter-ego must have tried to bring something worthwhile to US foreign policy for the last two decades.The action sequences look slick, though. Yes, there are a few things to bug you from a military standpoint (the initial op in Syria makes as little sense from a tactical point of view as the whole of the movie, and Kelly's tactics are at best dumb, and at times childlike - the final ""interrogation"" of the antagonist being a case in point).We´re left with a movie that had some good prospects. It's a work of Clancy, good actors, just enough ""wokeness"" - applied in a tasteful way, and a decent budget. Its greatest strength is the fact that it tried to mend some of the pain of the US population, to extend a hand between the African-American population and the conservative (mostly white) readership and viewership of Clancy's works. And the actors hopefully thought so as well. But the creators, as is often the case these race-obsessed days, MUST have felt that they had ticked all the boxes after plotting those points down, because the plot is an absolute incoherent mess, reducing it to a slot fit only for ""Amazon-and-chill"".",Without Remorse

Fact is a result of perception, so hopefully we can start enjoying movies again.For this movie itself, there were a decent amount of moments which are heavy on action and it is a high budget movie, even if it was all CGI, it was hard to tell.

Had very mild expectations while watching and had a decent time. It is so much not like the book it's not even worth being mad about. About people with ""woke"" complaints, I'd like to make the distinction that while 2 of the main actors are black, them being black was treated as completely irrelevant within the movie. There weren't any irritating messages thrown in. So kudos to Jordan, who I think had a producing role, for bringing a beloved character to the screen. I'm glad this was an hour 40 min and not 10 episodes.",Without Remorse

Not at all.I'm sorry to those that read the book and are looking for like-minded negative reviews, believe me, I've been there myself many times (Eragon=worst adaption of all time). But I had a great time with this movie. However, I did have one issue. As a veteran it is easy to pick apart military movies, but changing James Greer into a female navy seal, which has literally never happened in the history of the navy, and making her a lieutenant commander which suggests that she's been at it for a while, is a little bit of a stretch for me. Even as a casual watcher of a fictional action flick. I'm all for PC and what not, but they could've made this work a little more realistically.All that aside, if you're looking for a fun action flick, and you aren't overly picky about the details surrounding its delivery, you'll enjoy this one.... also, if you've read the book, you should probably avoid it, because obviously it didn't resonate as well for them.",Without Remorse

Movies and books based on the same story will ALWAYS be short of the details a full length novel provides.Like most Taylor Sheridan products, this is a great action flick that offers that uncomfortable hyper realism factor to many aspects of the movie. When your realize that this movie is more than likely meant as a foundation stone to a much larger Clancy Verse you can appreciate the movie for what it is.There are a few references in the movie than could connect this to the Amazon's Jack Ryan series (let's hope), allowing for the great start to a true dedicated Clancyverse.The movie itself I found to have good action movie acting, accurate gun fighting scenes. The motions of the fight scenes make sense and the physiology and physicist behind some of the stunts, injuries, special affects also remain constant, linear, and comparative with the surroundings which is why I like and will continue to like Sheridan so much.

From blinding obvious stupid decisions to inconsistent abilities without even touching on terrible character motivation.A team of highly trained individuals that can't seem to hit a cows bum with a shovel at 2 paces in one scene lurches to 3 of the most accurate hand grenade throws from a rooftop in the next.What on earth would posses you to take of a parachute in a plane that was crashing is beyond me but it enabled a nice underwater sequence whilst trying to retrieve badly stowed equipment I guess.Whilst the character motivation to avenge his wife's death is a reasonable driving factor it's not a touch on the original plot line in the novel.Clark was never written as a character who would feel like his country betrayed him, in fact duty was one of his core beliefs driving him onward. This film 'subverts my expectations' by flipping that on its head which while inline with modern Hollywood doesn't make it a good decision.If you haven't read the book then this film is still bad, the movement and weapons choreography of what is supposed to be a highly trained group is rubbish by modern standards - notably towards the end where they make their way down the stairs.

The original book had John befriending a falling in love with a drug attic who was killed this setting up a rain of revenge killings similar to what happens In this movie. In this movie we see the change from John Kelly to John Clark in a different fashion. He's already married already and part of a special operations unit in the military versus being in the CIA, goes on his revenge plan, and then disappears and becomes ""a ghost"". Then in the mid credit scene we see him set up the premise for rainbow six which in my opinion is one of the best Tom Clancy books out there.

1469,JimB123,Insanely terrible film adaptation,1,22 May 2021,"When I read the book ""Without Remorse"" by Tom Clancy several years ago, I remember thinking that this would make a great movie. I was excited to hear that a movie was coming out... I shouldn't have been excited.Let's get casting out of the way. The main character ""John Kelly"" is supposed to be an Irish American. MBJ certainly isn't. The John Kelly (aka John Clark) character is established as a white guy - which would be typical for an Irish American. All previous movies featuring this character have been played by a white guy. But in 2021, we need a black lead. The character is supposed to be tough as nails and somewhat stoic. MBJ comes off a bit over-emotional - it just doesn't play well. But the bad casting doesn't end there. The leader of the SEAL team is a black woman - because, well, why not. There's another woman on the SEAL team in one of the early combat missions. It all seems overly ""politically correct"".Now onto the plot. If you liked the book, you'll find NOTHING in this movie that looks familiar. About 20 minutes into the film I started doubting my memory of the book because absolutely nothing in the plot seemed familiar. I finally went to wikipedia to review the book plot - and I hadn't remembered incorrectly.The BOOK has a split plot, with half the plot being about John's love affair with an escaped prostitute/drug-mule - and his unstoppable desire to completely destroy the drug operation. The other half of the plot is a Rambo-esque story about rescuing POWs out of Vietnam. It's a great book - read it.The MOVIE has nothing of the above plots. Instead, the movie plot involves the CIA and the Russians. It's weird, disjoint, and generally not good.About the only thing that matches the book is that there is a character named ""John Kelly"" and at the end of the movie, that character fakes his death and is renamed ""John Clark"". That's it.If you know nothing about Tom Clancy, Jack Ryan, John Clark, or the book Without Remorse and just want to see MBJ shoot a lot of people, I'd maybe give this movie a 4/10.

1507,jhornsby912,Missed opportunity / Waste of MBJ,4,1 May 2021,"Michael B. Jordan gave an incredible performance, capturing the quiet determination and commitment of Tom Clancy's John Kelly. But the rest of this movie was a failure of imagination and a monument to formulaic cinema.The source novel takes place in the Vietnam War era, so it's understandable that they didn't want to make a straight translation of the book. But the storylines were still there for the taking - a Navy SEAL taking revenge on a drug trafficking network that caused his wife's death, while he's also doing covert operations for the CIA and DOD in a war zone? What part of that couldn't have been made relevant for today?An even bigger travesty is the character development of John Kelly in this movie. In the the novel, Kelly's handlers are continually surprised and impressed by his analysis of the economics of the drug trade and interpersonal dynamics of the drug cartel he's trying to take down. He's also adept with logistics and tactical strategy, even improving on their mission plans in Vietnam. These traits are what make him so valuable to the CIA, and eventually the obvious choice for heading up Rainbow. But in the movie, Kelly is reduced to a killing machine who shows flashes of intelligence, yet still manages to fall into just about every trap set for him. Too often, MBJ's Kelly has to fight his way out of a bad situation, whereas Clancy's Kelly was always one step ahead.The 4 stars here are for MBJ making the most of what he was given. Too bad the creative team didn't make the most of what they were given by Clancy and could've been given by MBJ.",Without Remorse

The girl SEAL boss seemed weak, but then I viewed her more as a modern manager, using empathy and understanding to balance take the edge of the old tough guy persona. I'm happy to see this change. And honestly, she seemed realistic for what the future SEAL environment may look like.Some pretty good and unique action scenes. Definitely worth the watch.

I was even pretty stoked with Michael B. Jordan's casting. He has the range and depth to bring Clark to life just as well as any of the other actors who have.

The story itself feels a little poorly structured, with inconsistencies, and there is little development of, or depth to, the majority of characters.But overall, I think Amazon have attempted to make an entertaining and watchable film, if a bit shallow and unemotional, and whilst a little run-of-the-mill, and with some moments of soap-opera cheesiness, in my opinion they have achieved that and the visual effects also appear well done.For this reason I'd give this 6 stars - it certainly isn't a 1 or 2/10 disaster.
