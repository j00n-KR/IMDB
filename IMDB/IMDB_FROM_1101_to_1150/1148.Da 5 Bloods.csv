0,nogodnomasters,You will not kill Paul,7,17 June 2020,"Four ex-Vietnam vets and a son return to Vietnam to face ghosts and demons. They are there to hunt for fallen comrade Norman, the brains and soul of the group. He happens to be buried with a chest full of gold which they plan to convert and take out with them. Gold is heavy and they run into issues and landmines along the way (literally).This was a Spike Lee film. He uses Delroy Lindo to do asides and explain Black History. As explained in the film, green is more important than black. The film is filled with flashbacks.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Da 5 Bloods
1,kosmasp,They got five on it,9,18 June 2020,"Spike Lee is outspoken. He does not make it a secret that he is not a fan of Trump at all. Now in the time we live in, that may make his movies a no go to some (yes political views seem to matter to some more than the actual quality of the movie they might or might not watch). In this though, Spike Lee tells a story and does not just give us a history lesson.A story that is complicated, with regrets, with PTSD, with hidden treasures, with mental issues and more. There is a lot that can be discovered here. One of the things being who the characters are. Including one Black Trump fan - missguided you say? Well the position of Spike is clear on this, but the movie has more to say than just that. And the soundtrack helps boosting that, even though I'm not sure the placing of the ride of the valkyries was the best. But that's just me and how I experienced it. You may feel it's completely apt.Now Spike does not hold back and there will be blood, there will be violence in this and there will be quite the weird relationships and how they play out. Sometimes the ghosts of the past do not let go. Even if they never meant to keep you down. This is complex, yet intriguing, suspensful and entertaining to a degree, while very informative too. Social injustice and social equivalence has not been achieved yet - if you don't confront your past, you can't be living your future!",Da 5 Bloods
2,classicsoncall,"""You're goin' home, Blood.""",8,29 September 2020,"There's not much doubt where Spike Lee stands politically, though how he expressed it in prior films has been much more subtle. In this one it's a lot more in your face, with no love lost for government in general and the current President in particular. Perhaps in a concession to diversity of thought, he makes one of his principal characters a MAGA fan, but as we all know, the gospel according to Joe Biden states that Paul (Delroy Lindo) can't really be black because he votes Republican. Lee offers a myriad of historical references throughout the picture with nods to Crispus Attucks (the first black killed during the American Revolution), Muhammad Ali, Kent State and some of the more recognizable images from the Viet Nam War. In fact there are a whole host of Easter eggs throughout the picture that the dedicated fan could look up if some of them blew by too quickly. Personally, the tribute to ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" was more than blatant when the thug Quan came out with ""We don't need no stinkin' official badges!"" in order to seize the gold cache found by the former Viet comrades. What I found interesting in the flashback scenes was how Stormin' Norman (Chadwick Boseman) remained in his Twenties while his fellow squad members appeared at their current age, a concession I imagine to how all of the remaining Bloods would have remembered him. If a particular point is to be made by the film, it might be best expressed by the character of jungle guide Vinh (Johnny Nguyen), who quite eloquently stated - ""After you've been in a war, you understand it really never ends"". Other reviewers for this picture have pointed out the many inconsistencies in the story line so no need to rehash them here. My only question would be why Spike Lee would have allowed them to remain in the movie.",Da 5 Bloods
3,searchanddestroy-1,"Was Spike Lee under drug or what, was he drunk?",3,5 August 2020,"This movie could have been far far better than this....We have the Spike Lee's trade mark, no problem, and no only because it speaks about Black characters, and very well played. But this feature is so lame in the storyline, so lousy. For instance the Vietnam Vet who gets back forty years later and finds his former girlfriend who seems more than his daughter than his ex gal and mother of his daughter - who seems more than his grand daughter. How can you have a twenty years old daughter forty years later? And in the scenes taking place forty years earlier, how can you have the same face, same grey hair as forty years later? I think Spike Lee should have chosen different actors to have the sixties period characters. But besides those goofs, this is a rather good and gripping feature.",Da 5 Bloods
4,CinemaSerf,Join Da 5 dots...,5,13 June 2020,"Ok, so a team of old African American soldiers decide to return to Vietnam to find the body of their colleague who was killed in action - and to retrieve some $17m worth of gold bars. En route they have to face some personal demons; an old girlfriend and the locals who have their own plans... It's not dreadful, but it certainly could not be described as Spike Lee anywhere near his best. The gang do emanate some sense of comradeship and loyalty, but in such a gung-ho fashion as to render the whole thing little better than a run-of-the mill Nicolas Cage style shoot 'em up effort with a really rather episodic and inevitable structure and a storyline remarkably indifferent to the indigenous population. Two and half hours is far too long, to. Looks great, though but sorry, more miss than hit for me.",Da 5 Bloods
5,view_and_review,Brace Yourself,7,20 June 2020,"Vietnam War movies were really popular in the 80's. I think we were far enough removed from the War to talk about it, yet not too far removed where it was no longer relevant. Many of the vets were still relatively young in the 80's so it made sense to tell their story at that time.We are now roughly 50 years removed from the Vietnam War and Spike Lee is revisiting it in his movie ""Da 5 Bloods."" The majority of the movie takes place in present day Vietnam, but there are some scenes from the Vietnam War and five Black American men who fought there. Spike Lee also threw in some actual footage and I don't think there are warnings strong enough to prepare you for some of the ""grisly"" footage that he added in the movie.The movie follows Paul (Delroy Lindo), Otis (Clarke Peters), Eddie (Norm Lewis), Melvin (Isiah Whitlock Jr.), and David (Jonathan Majors), with the first four being fellow soldiers and David being the son of Paul. They formed an unbreakable bond while serving in Vietnam as I'm sure many soldiers formed. Though they lost one of their fellow soldiers named Stormin Norman (Chadwick Boseman), they all reunited decades later to visit Vietnam one last time. Though it wasn't for nostalgic reasons, it was for some hidden gold.Now, so many years removed from the war, the effects of the war upon them are more evident--and it seems that it affected some more than others. Like any Spike Lee movie, it is charged with poignant messages about race and the wide spectrum of beliefs and characteristics of Black Americans. This movie will require a strong constitution to deal with both: racial matters as well as bloody violence. War movies aren't for everyone, and Spike Lee isn't for everyone, so if you know what to expect from both, then I think you will enjoy this movie.",Da 5 Bloods
6,evanston_dad,Fierce and Entertaining,8,29 July 2020,"If ever there was a hot mess of a movie, ""Da 5 Bloods"" is it. But given the director and the subject, I wouldn't have it any other way.Like his earlier film ""BlackKklansman,"" Spike Lee's latest is both an angry and funny roar of outrage about the treatment of blacks in America. But unlike the earlier movie, ""Da 5 Bloods"" is nowhere nearly as focused. It's about a group of Vietnam vets who meet up in present day to return to the Vietnam jungle in an effort to find some lost treasure they know is still out there as well as the remains of their fellow soldier, who was never found. This sets the stage for an unpredictable and whackadoodle adventure story that's part ""Apocalypse Now,"" part ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,"" and part something Quentin Tarantino might concoct if he were asked to tell a tale about Vietnam. It spends some of its time exorcising demons still remaining from the Vietnam War and some of its time tackling racism. The rest of its time is spent trying, mostly unsuccessfully, to tie these two themes together. The movie is all over the map, erratic in tone, with too many plot strands and too much that feels tangential to the main story.But damned if I didn't give in and have a blast with this film, despite its many flaws. It's so confidently ambitious that I was easily able to forgive it when it didn't entirely hit its targets. And right now I don't want carefully crafted, reasoned movies about subjects like race, because that isn't what our world feels like. Our world resembles a loud, screaming dumpster fire and I'm craving movies that feel like that too.In a film filled with good performances, Delroy Lindo stands out as the hot headed member of the group who ventures into the heart of darkness and loses his way.Grade: A",Da 5 Bloods
7,ferguson-6,What's going on,7,7 January 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. Co-writers Danny Bilson (father of actress Rachel) and Paul De Meo, collaborators on the underrated THE ROCKETEER (1991), originally wrote this story about white veterans returning to Vietnam. That project was never able to move to production. When (Oscar winners for BLACKKKLANSMAN, 2018) Spike Lee and his co-writer Kevin Willmott got involved, the characters shifted and it became a story about African-American veterans, and the film now carries a distinct message about racism and the effects of war on those who feel unappreciated.Director Lee opens the movie with a montage of such historic events and influential people as the lunar landing, Angela Davis, LBJ, Kent State, Jackson State, Richard Nixon, Bobby Seale, and Donald Trump, along with statements from Muhammad Ali and Martin Luther King, both vocal in their opposition to the Vietnam War. Mr. Lee knows exactly what he's doing, as this prologue sets such a serious tone upfront that we are maneuvered, or at least urged, into accepting his film as truth-based.Four war veterans who served together are seen reuniting in the lobby of a hotel in modern day Ho Chi Minh City (formerly known as Saigon). As the men warmly greet each other, we quickly grasp the individual personalities. Paul (Delroy Lindo) is the hot-headed, grudge-holding, MAGA hat wearing fellow who bares his emotions on his sleeve (if he were wearing sleeves). Otis (Clarke Peters) is the former medic, and calm mediator, while Eddie (Norm Lewis) is the successful capitalist, and Melvin (Isiah Whitlock, Jr) is the free-wheeling, party guy. Why are there only 4 'bloods'? Well, officially the men are there to exhume the remains of their fallen and revered squad leader, Stormin' Norman (Chadwick Boseman), and return him to his family in the United States.The official mission got the men back to Vietnam, but it's their ulterior motive that turns this into something akin to a heist movie. The men plan to recover the millions of dollars of gold bars they buried in the jungle all those years ago. Though he has not been invited, Paul's son David (Jonathan Majors) shows up, intent on accompanying dear old dad and his war buddies on their big score. Cashing in on the gold requires the men to trust Tien (Y. Lan), a former local prostitute who had a relationship with Otis during the war, and Desroche (Jean Reno), a shady black market French money man. Director Lee attempts to sustain some suspense regarding the Desroche character, but as the only white man involved, that mystery falls a bit flat.Additional supporting work is provided by Melanie Thierry, Paul Walter Hauser, and Jasper Paakkonen as a trio that inadvertently gets caught up in the bloods' scheme. A nice touch is Veronica Ngo as Hanoi Hannah, with her lines pulled from actual broadcasts during the war - including the unsettling send off, ""Have a good day, gentlemen."" There is little doubt this is meant to be Delroy Lindo's film. His raging rants and explosive PTSD express the frustrations felt by many Vietnam War veterans, but particularly the African Americans, whom we are told made up 32% of soldiers on the battlefields. Lindo has a scene near the end of the film where he looks directly into the camera and goes off for a few minutes. It's the kind of scene that garners award recognition. Special notice also goes to Chadwick Boseman, whose final two films were this one and the excellent MA RAINEY'S BLACK BOTTOM. In Lee's film, we absolutely accept Boseman as the spiritual and military leader of these men.Spike Lee seemed to enjoy paying tribute and tipping his Knicks' cap to many influences throughout the film. Especially notable are the similarities to scenes from Francis Ford Coppola's APOCALYPSE NOW (1979) and John Huston's THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE (1948), including the iconic ""stinkin' badges"" line. Lee also pokes some fun at Sylvester Stallone's Rambo, and the whole genre of a white man as savior. Donald Trump certainly doesn't escape unscathed, as he's referred to as ""President Fake Bone Spurs"". On a lighter note, the 5 Bloods plus Paul's son share their first names of those from the original Motown group, The Temptations, as well as their famed producer (Norman Whitfield). Lee also includes heartfelt tributes to African American war heroes Crispus Attucks and Milton Olive, and then includes some tremendous songs from the late, great Marvin Gaye.The cinematography from Newton Thomas Sigel is exceptional, and Lee opts to change aspect ratios for the flashback scenes. Yet another interesting choice is that even during those flashbacks, the Bloods look their current age, even though it was 50 years prior. The idea being, in their memories, they see themselves as they are today. One glitch is that, periodically, composer Terence Blanchard's score overpowers the moment. Not always, but enough to distract. Spike Lee really mixes things up, as at various times, this is a story of friendship, loyalty, history, greed, and camaraderie ... and the emotional price paid for war. At 154 minutes, the run time is a bit long, but it's one of Mr. Lee's more ambitious films, and perhaps one of his best.",Da 5 Bloods
8,ElMaruecan82,Jungle Fever ...,7,20 November 2020,"Spike Lee's ""Do The Right Thing"" (skip that first paragraph if you didn't watch the film) climaxed when the most emblematic figure of the hood Radio Raheem, was strangled to death by a cop. The recent events of 2020 proved how sadly prophetic the film was and how a significant milestone it still is. Before it became a slogan, Lee was the director whose movies shouted that Black lives mattered while whispering a few other comments about America's painful cohabitation between communities, puppets whose strings were pulled by a corrupt system.And in ""Da 5 Bloods"" Lee tackles another wound in America's history: the Vietnam War. Released in a time where the veterans form the same age group than their WW2 predecessors when they watched ""Saving Private Ryan"", the film shows the futility of the war as only one tip of the iceberg, under the sea there's the sacrifice of thousands of Black privates who fought for a country that fought their own brothers back home. Gruesome footage of the Vietnam war intersect with excerpts showing Muhammad Ali, Angela Davis, Bobby Seale and of course Martin and Malcolm expressing the kind of stances that make us more than aware we're dealing with a Spike Lee Joint. Speaking for myself, the opening sequence was ""good news"" but then I found something quite disconcerting with ""Da Bloods"" in the way it blends between action and social comment, and the results lacked a certain finesse.Okay, the film is about four veterans played by Delroy Lindo (Paul), Clarke Peters (Otis), Norm Lewis (Eddie) and Isaiah Whitlock Jr. (Melvin). With Jonathan Majors who plays Paul's son David, the five characters are named after the Temptations members (the one reference that pass over many viewers' head). They come to Vietnam to seek the remains of the fifth member of their squad Norman (Chadwick Bosman) and the gold treasure they buried during a mission. Their goal is to donate the fortune to the cause (and certainly keeping a little share for them).The gold isn't theirs but they feel like the system owed them that, it's only business. But it's also personal as Stormin' Norman was more than a leader, he was their mentor and the one who convinced them to keep the gold in the name of the thousands of African Americans lives that were sacrificed as the altar of White oppression. And still, for all its attempt to give the mission a meaning, and its many references to ""Apocalypse Now"", the film is closer to movies like Gene Hackman's ""Uncommon Valor"" and the ""Rambo""-type movies the four protagonists were mocking. In fact, the whole joint is a goldmine of references to content generations of movie lovers, not just ""Apocalypse Now"" but also ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" and ""The Bridge Over the River Kwai"", so many allusions I was glad to spot.Adventure, genres, buddy-movie, ""Da 5 Bloods"" ventures in so many genres that it's tempting to brand it a 'homage picture', something his greatest rival Quentin Tarantino specialized in. It's also a homage in the more typical fashion of Lee with his story being punctuated with mentions of great names that forged the African-American fight and that find a strong echo in the tragic 2020 events. My problem is that sometimes I felt like it was Lee speaking through his characters and never themselves, with the exception of Paul who's one of the best embodiments of PTSD I saw in a movie in recent years.I mentioned ""Saving Private Ryan"" and it's true Spielberg took the easy way by tackling a war whose ""good vs. bad"" narrative is clear. Lee handles a more controversial war, but many directors did before. Did they need speeches? Watching Private Pyle's descent into madness in ""Full Metal Jacket"" was enough to tell you how hellish a state of mind war is. Colonel Nicholson's ""what have I done?"" epiphany or the sight of surfers in the Vietnamese were striking images. ""Da 5 Bloods"" had such images but as it needed to insist upon these points, it filled the film with too many historical parenthesis it became distracting, you know like these teachers who find any excuse to digress on things they find interesting.Had the film been a straight adventure in the vein of John Huston's ""Sierra Madre"", it would have been great. Had it been a polemical documentary about the Vietnam war it would have been eye-opening, but Lee is torn between the didactic and the entertainment that he loses his way. By begging to be significant, he forgets to be focused. The result is an entertaining fast-paced film with uneven parts, a father-and-son drama, a action war picture, an existential film... in the end an entertaining mess saved by the grandiose performance of Delroy Lindo who's the touchstone of the film, the emotional soul, the character who's so multilayered that the others, except maybe for Otis feel bland in comparaison. The subplot involving Otis' wife and daughter is so underdeveloped it's almost anecdotic and makes its conclusion (with Lee's trademark sliding effect) almost comic.There are also some shocking moments especially with the mines, in fact the whole middle act of the film is pretty thrilling. Majors is good and Melanie Thierry is interesting through there's a weird dissonance between her thick French accent and her English eloquence. At least, Jean Reno was consistent in his poor man's Bond-villain performance and adds an interesting level of campiness in a film that takes itself too seriously while almost flirting with the fourth wall. (Lindo's superb monologue could have been even more powerful without that smile at the end) I'm still hoping he gets an Oscar nomination and maybe another nod for Bosman who delivers a fine and eerily sad performance as the ""ghost from the past"".Still, it's a shame Lee gets so wrapped up in his activism that he forgot he had the material for a great action picture... and action often speaks more eloquent words than preaches.",Da 5 Bloods
9,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Good morning, Vietnam.",8,15 June 2020,"'Da 5 Bloods (2020)' is engaging and alarming. It confronts its audience with some harsh truths and, at times, is an uncomfortable experience because of it. It's also an important experience, though, as it tangles with themes of exploitation, racism, post-traumatic stress and war with a surprising degree of nuance. Though the piece is an odd mix of black comedy, traditional action and shocking archive footage, it somehow comes together as a fictional tale that conveys quite a bit of truth. It's effective in almost all its aspects. The thing does feel long but that's principally because it's constantly unpredictable, shifting in tone and, even, genre often within the same scene. Its formalistic elements often catch you off guard, too. At times, it's truly horrifying; I mean, some of its graphic stock footage is the sort of thing you can never unsee. Its frankness is a part of its DNA, though. While it isn't necessarily a fun film, it is one worth watching. It offers a new perspective on an often misrepresented time-period. It rings true despite its fictional plot. 8/10",Da 5 Bloods
10,ThomasDrufke,Excellent,8,2 July 2020,"Spike Lee really nails exactly what a war film needs with Da 5 Bloods, well-shot action/battle sequences, great tension, and a group of soldiers you fall in love with over the course of 2 hours. And even better, he bends that formula even more by having veterans return to where they fought in Vietnam to both return the remains of their fallen friend, as well as the treasure they once hid all those decades ago. Lee also makes a few interesting choices in the flashbacks that grew on me after a while and in hindsight, clearly add to the dynamic the soldiers have with each other. The 3rd act doesn't close out the film as well as I would have hoped but it's easily on the higher echelon of Netflix original films over the last few years. Da 5 Bloods is great though.8.2/10",Da 5 Bloods
11,Cineanalyst,History Now,5,13 June 2020,"""Da 5 Bloods"" is unmistakably a Spike Lee joint, but what is with Netflix and macho action movies set in a war-torn foreign land and featuring a heist or extraction of some kind. I mean, they comprise a significant block of their original releases of late and usually include a star taking a break from superhero flicks: ""6 Underground"" with Deadpool, ""Triple Frontier"" with Batman, ""The Red Sea Diving Resort"" with Captain America, all 2019, ""Extraction"" with Thor earlier this year and, now, here's Black Panther in Vietnam where his friends, fellow veterans and ""bloods"" are in search of gold to plunder. Oh well, credit to Lee and company for making a better movie than those prior ones. Unlike the others, ""Da 5 Bloods"" doesn't have the feel of merely exploiting an exotic locale and racial others, as it largely focuses on the Black veterans detestation of having fought in a war supposedly for freedom while lacking freedom back home, while a couple of the younger characters speak of choosing careers to assuage their guilt for their respective privileges. Moreover, there's a glimpse of modernized streets in Ho Chi Minh City, McDonald's and an ""Apocalypse Now"" themed club included, before the brothers in arms proceed into the jungle, with more than token representation throughout of Vietnamese characters, including interracial relationships, as well as of the French, the first Western colonizer of Indochina. Yet, evidence remains that this scenario was originally a predictable action-heist screenplay (the way one character conspicuously walks backwards in one scene--telegraphing what's about to happen especially bothers me) before Lee and company rewrote it for Black protagonists and introduced some rather unpredictable social commentary.Indeed, Lee's racial didacticism is all over the place, ranging from Crispus Attucks to Martin Luther King Jr. and the present-day Black Lives Matter movement and the inclusion of a MAGA-hat-wearing, Trump-supporting member of the Bloods, but this scattered approach is somewhat supported by the premise of the characters revisiting their pasts, as well as by the historically-minded ones played by Chadwick Boseman and Jonathan Majors. As with much of Lee's oeuvre, as well as that of others, I'm less interested in simplistic lectures than in how such morals are supported stylistically. To my mind, such was the redeeming feature of Lee's last joint, ""BlacKkKlansmen"" (2018), which I found more interesting as a conflict between racist epics ""The Birth of a Nation"" (1915) with ""Gone with the Wind"" (1939) against the Blaxploitation flicks of the 1970s, from which Lee paid homage with his film's style, than for any historical racial conflict or commentary on the Trump administration.Something similar is done with the look of ""Da 5 Bloods"" sometimes resembling that of footage from the era of the American-Vietnam War, with images at times consequently appearing soft or colors overly saturated. Characters also use their own 8mm motion-picture and a still-photography cameras. Apropos to its subject matter, then, the style, from 8mm, to 16mm, to 35mm and still photographs, is all over the place, as are the shifting aspect ratios. Rather incongruent, however, is that the same actors play their younger selves without the sort of de-aging technology employed for Netflix's ""The Irishman"" (2019), although I don't much mind this otherwise if one understands the flashbacks as past episodes as remembered as opposed to being from the perspective of a hypothetical objective observer. Of course, there are also the usual Lee trademarks of raving monologues and double dolly shots (as well as the relatively new addition of casting Isiah Whitlock, Jr. to recite his catchphrase from ""The Wire"" HBO series). Meanwhile, the greater cinematic relfexivity of ""BlackKklansmen"" is replaced here in part by music and radio, with a Marvin Gaye-infused soundtrack and stinging radio propaganda from Hanoi Hannah (Veronica Ngo). While some critics will be concerned with how Lee captures some current zeitgeist, especially given the film's release during the protests currently taking place across the nation and the world as of this writing, ultimately more interesting methinks is whether this historically-minded film, as with his past work, will stand the test of time.",Da 5 Bloods
12,John6Daniels,6 TONS OF Blood,3,31 October 2020,"It's an alright film. Nothing that says WOW!!It's basically a post military drama film about 4 (5-6) mercenaries for the USA who reminisce about their times in Vietnam while in Vietnam.The acting is done really well. Story is there but I guess its a hit and miss in some places. The shootout scenes were done very well. Like how this movie was not afraid to kill many main characters without over dramatization.Da 5 Blood Would be a solid 7.5 but the BLM bit at the end gave this movie a 3.

13,Thanos_Alfie,The return...,7,6 January 2021,"""Da 5 Bloods"" is a Drama - Adventure movie in which we watch five veterans returning to Vietnam in order to find and retrieve the remains of their fallen squad leader. They will also search for a gold they hid there when they were fighting.I liked this movie very much because it had an interesting plot with plenty of action and suspense. The direction which was made by Spike Lee was very good and I believe that he did a great job on combining some dramatic moments with action. He also did something that I have not watched in any other movie, he kept the same actors to play in some flashbacks without making them look younger, something that I found very interesting and new. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I have to say that I enjoyed very much the interpretation of Chadwick Boseman who played as Stormin' Norman and it was one of his last interpretations. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Clarke Peters' who played as Otis, Delroy Lindo's who played as Paul and Isiah Whitlock Jr. who played as Melvin. Finally, I have to say that ""Da 5 Bloods"" is an amazing movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure that everyone could gain something by watching it.",Da 5 Bloods
14,cruise01,"Great performances, pretty decent plot with a strong theme but overlong slow running time.",7,13 June 2020,Da 5 Bloods (3.5 out of 5 stars).Da 5 Bloods is a pretty fair war drama film. About foue Vietnam vets that go back to the jungle in modern time to search for their best friend remains while searching for hidden treasure they buried.The plot is good also focusing on modern times of race and black lives matter concept. The film also shows the struggle each vet is going through mentally and physically. Delroy Lindo delivers a powerful performance that he is struggling with. The cast is good with there performances.The film does have a sense of style with Spike Lees direction with the narrative switching between Vietnam war to present day.

15,eddie_baggins,Did I watch a different film to the critics?,4,15 June 2020,"Since his first true feature film She's Gotta Have It in 1986, Spike Lee has remained one of the most passionate and hard-working filmmakers in the industry, with each of his projects being born from the mind of an outspoken individual who isn't afraid to tackle issues and subject matters others would do all they could to avoid.While this passion has made for some outstanding individual results and moments, Lee has also continued to be one of the most eclectic directors when its comes to quality control, with audiences unsure whether they are getting a new masterpiece or a genuine dud, such is the wide ranging variation of his projects.For every Do the Right Thing, The 25th Hour or BlacKKKlansman there's an Oldboy, Miracle at St. Anna or Red Hook Summer, works of an artist that sometimes loses focus on quality control in his quest to tackle the often controversial material his bringing to life.One of his most high-profile releases of the last decade, Lee's first feature since the Oscar winning success of BlacKKKlansman is his long time coming Vietnam passion project Da 5 Bloods, a well-cast Netflix production that shines a light on black service man in the Vietnam war, whilst also offering a thrilling treasure hunt plot-line with aging African American veterans returning to the battlefields of the war torn country.It's an incredibly intriguing set-up and one that allows Lee to explore topical race related scenarios while also operating in one of his biggest cinematic playgrounds yet but this two and a half hour exercise is the type of let-down of a film that is littered throughout Lee's career, as his poor pacing, editing, story developments and intrusively scored effort continually disappoints throughout.Loaded up with a cast full of talent with Delroy Lindo, The Wire's Clark Peters and Isiah Whitlock Jr, Jean Reno and Black Panther himself Chadwick Boseman all involved, Da 5 Bloods appears on paper to be ripe for the best type of Lee film but with a collection of mostly unlikable characters, long in the tooth scenarios and situations and an abundance of atrocious plot contrivances (hello gold discovery during a toilet break), Lee's exercise has too many flaws to overlook and more often than not feels amateurish, not the work of an Oscar winning writer.It's not to say the film is bereft of good ideas or moments, there are numerous touching scenes exploring the effect of war on these man, particularly in how they returned to a country that seemed to not value their services or still continued to judge them by their skin color and some of the interplay between the experienced actors makes for both funny and heartfelt viewing but too often than not Lee is hammering his audience over the head with the films topics with all the care of a sledgehammer, instead of refining his product into a polished offering it was so desperately in need of becoming.Final Say -A hugely disappointing effort from Lee, Da 5 Bloods may have found its share of critical acclaim but while its themes and subject matter should be commended, as a film; this Netflix release is as unpolished and unfocused as they come.2 gold bars out of 5",Da 5 Bloods

19,Vartiainen,What war does to us,6,25 June 2020,"Spike Lee's newest film is an exploration of war, missed chances and modern day politics. In it a group of Vietnam War veterans return to Vietnam to look for a treasure they buried there during the war. On their journey we see flashbacks of their war experiences and explore their many, many regrets, losses and hindrances. Plus talk about what it means to be black back then as well as now.Spike Lee is a powerhouse behind the camera. This film is superbly shot. The story is told marvelously. Every scene felt necessary, every scene build on top of another. Likewise, the actors gave it their all and I liked the variance in the characters they portrayed. Each had scars from the war, but they all had dealt and were dealing with them differently.That being said, this film is political. It's really, really, really political. To some, that's one of its strengths. Lee does not pull any punches. He tells you what he thinks, as straight as he can. To some that means a lot. To me, a Nordic white man in my early 30s, it doesn't mean quite as much. Although I don't mind it. I didn't find it distracting nor did I find it unwarranted. It simply wasn't one of the cornerstones of the film.That being said, I can imagine that to Americans this film will have an impact. But even if you're from outside the US, the film has a lot to offer if you're looking to understand America as it is today and how it came to be like that. Especially when it comes to its black population.I can recommend the film. I can definitely recommend it.",Da 5 Bloods
20,subxerogravity,Black Lives Matter!!,7,13 June 2020,"Not the best Spike Lee joint ever, but a great movie, especially for the times we are living in.
This was the first movie I watched snice I noticed that Netflix put up their Black Lives Matter recommendations and Spike does not disappoint.
Very complex story about four black Vietnam vets coming back to Vietnam to find the lost body of the one that did not make it home 50 years ago, and the gold he's laid to rest with.
I feel like Spike is trying to make up for Miracle at St. Anna. A movie about black soldiers in World War 2. This was a much stronger portrait of African Americans fighting an American war.
Although watching this I see how Spike went wrong with Miracle at St. Anna. Da 5 Bloods can be a little clunky at times as if Spike did not have as much insight on the topic. I get that, as he is not a vet of any war (except the semi-Civil War he faces as a black man in America which allowed him to perfectly craft movies like Do the Right Thing and Blackkklansman). Sometimes the information just seem tossed at me like a documentary, which maybe is what he was going for, but it did clash with a scenes where he was laying down the knowledge with an emotional narrative.
I'll say this. It was a beautiful movie. Spike has an eye and this film shows that eye. You could tell he's getting into more technically film tactics to make it look like Vietnam during the 60s and 70s when he has to and Spike is always really good at making the film feel warm.
An amazing ensemble cast of actors helping to bring life to Spike's movies. It's hard to pick out just one cause literally everyone truly help to movie this tory along.
Overall, this was definetly a treat.",Da 5 Bloods
21,billcr12,Too Long,7,28 June 2021,"Spike Lee is watching too many Scorcese films. I still haven't watched The Irishman due to the 31/2 hour length. I finally got around to Da 5 Bloods, and it is over 2 1/2 hours. Lee neded to edit it down to a manageable length. Delroy Lindo is great as Paul, one of four vets who travel back to 'Nam to find their fallen comrad. The bigger reason for the trip is to find a stash of gold in them thar hills. This is where the movie loses all credibility with too many unbeleivable scenes. Da 5 Bloods could have been one of the years ten best, but the overlong drama just misses.

22,st-shot,Tribal Tedium,4,30 June 2020,"Spike Lee's second war film ( Miracle of St. Anna, 2008) is one messy message picture featuring Lee's sloppy attempts at coherence. A brother bonding film of rage and self pity with more than its share of insipid dialogue, Lee attempts to inject history into the story with his occasional bias cheap shot. Scattered in every way, Lee's focus remains haphazard as he pontificates ham fistedly into nearly every scene which trail's off rather than resonate as this diffuse mess wanders from Crispus Attucks to BLM to make his point achieved so much more powerfully, summed up in one scene and decades earlier in Apocalypse, Now. Lee drags us through two and half hours to get to his. Speaking of Now, he does one of his heavy handed homages and manages to botch that as well.A quartet of four Viet vets return to the heart of darkness to retrieve their fallen leader and a huge gold supply. An abrasive but basically altruistic bunch they have to enlist some shady characters which leads to conflict while they sought out their inner one.As in many of Lee's films we get the loose cannon threatening to upend everything and DelRoy Lindo does an excellent job here as the tortured veteran with the short fuse. Pursued by inner demons from the past he brings power to all his scenes, something lacking in the rest of Lee's bland undeveloped cast delivering banal dialogue. Lee utilizes his usual go to crutch of pop music well and the documentary footage in the early going really revs matters up but it quickly devolves into another Lee one note mantra as his band of brothers rumble through the jungle in a funk with the occasional burst of automatic weapons fire to keep the audience awake. Da 5 Bloods is a passionate but diffuse mawkish mess, unconvincingly told.",Da 5 Bloods
23,alindsay-al,An Above Average dramatic film,6,13 June 2020,"This film hit Netflix yesterday and I have now seen Da 5 Bloods and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Four African American Vets return to Vietnam to find the remains of their old leader and the gold that they hid together.
Main Character
Delroy Lindo plays the most fleshed out character and he is amazing here. He owns every scene he is in, there are times where you can't take your eyes off of him, he is the one most affected by the war and he does a really good job of portraying this. He is the most interesting character in the film and I thought he was the best part of this entire film.
Supporting Characters
The rest of the crew have good chemistry together, but there is no doubt that I didn't care about them anywhere as much as Lindo and I felt like as the film progressed I cared less and less about them. Chadwick Boseman is in this film and does a decent job when he is on screen but he doesn't really have much of a character, we are told all these good things about him but we never see him so it makes you question just how good he is. The rest of the cast didn't do much for me whether they were protagonists or antagonists they were pretty dull and generic.
Story
This story has an interesting premise to it, as you see these guys hunt for this gold you see how it affects them and how there lives have changed and it is done well. Also this film has plenty of moral and political questions to ask and some of it was handled well, others not. This film has too many side plots that feel pointless and it takes up a good part of the first act making it pretty much an hour in before they actually go on their journey and by then I was a bit bored. Also this film tries to mix real life issues with this film and I thought it was handled very clumsily, it feels like Spike Lee the director was trying to send a very clear message but in my opinion it took away from the movie and felt like he was just was trying to tell the history of black culture which is obviously important but I am just not sure if it was needed in this film.
Script
The script has some really grest dramatic dialogue, it has some really memorable moments and builds the tension really well. The humour used here didn't really work for me and I think that will be a subjective thing but I think it also had something to do with how it was used sometimes leading to a clashing of tones.
Style
The film as mentions does a great job in building suspense and tension, there are some really uncomfortable scenes and this film did a great job with it. Also there are a few good shootouts here when they happen and this film is filmed really well with a unique style to it. But I can't help but mention that the pace is just off, the first hour is so slow and with the film being 2 and a half hours it needs to grip you early but for me it just didn't.
Overall
Overall, this is clearly a passion project by Spike Lee and there are some highlights for sure mainly being his style and the lead performance. Though, I don't believe this will be remembered as one of his greats as sometimes his beliefs overpower the story and this is a longer film then it needed to be. If you are a fan of war films then this might be for you and it is a decent watch but I wouldn't say it is one to rush to see.",Da 5 Bloods
24,henry8-3,Da 5 Bloods,3,24 June 2020,"4 black ex Vietnam soldiers go back to find the body of their lost comrade and a pile of gold.After a decent enough first half hour where you get to the know the individuals, their problems and their feelings about the war and their beloved fallen comrade this decends into a really badly put together Treasure of the Sierra Madre rip off. Full of over the top characters and silly speeches linked in with Lee's usual messages, this would have been acceptable had it not been for the structure of the hunt for the body / gold adventure which is totally unbelievable and gets worse and worse as the film progresses. Redeemed very slightly in the last 20 minutes, it remains a misguided and annoying mess.",Da 5 Bloods

The cinematography is tremendous, there are many great looking scenes in this; the whole look of the film is top notch.The run time could've perhaps been shorter, but most war films tend to go on for a while to be honest. I will say that I didn't enjoy the start and end as much I did the middle, but there's still enough in there. I would also agree that some of the real life imagery used is unnecessary.The cast are excellent. Delroy Lindo is, for me, the star of the 156 minutes. He gives an outstanding performance as Paul, one I won't be forgetting any time soon. It's always a pleasure to see Chadwick Boseman (Norman), while Clarke Peters (Otis), Norm Lewis (Eddie) and Isiah Whitlock Jr. (Melvin) are all likeable in their respective roles.I unquestionably, with zero doubt, like those four in the lead roles, but man the original cast list would've been absolutely incredible.

28,masonfisk,SPIKE DOES IT AGAIN...!,10,19 January 2021,"Spike Lee's latest debuted last year as a Netflix original. Incorporating John Huston's seminal The Treasure of Sierra Madre (Walter Hill did the same thing w/his actioner Trespass starring Ice Cube & Ice T back in the 90's), we have a quartet of Vietnam vets, all African American, revisiting their old military stomping grounds on the pretext of finding a lost comrade's body who died over there but actually they're retrieving a cache of gold bars (initially intended as a payment to the South Vietnamese people) which they robbed themselves & buried. No sooner do they land back in 'Nam do the four men (Delroy Lindo, Isiah Whitlock Jr., Clarke Peters & Norm Lewis) start getting back into the groove of things (whether they like it or not) w/Lindo's latent PTSD asserting itself at every turn, Peters discovering he left behind a Vietnamese daughter he didn't know about, Lewis, a successful car dealership owner is found out to be penniless, while Whitlock Jr. wants to do the right thing by their dead brother (played in flashbacks by Chadwick Boseman) by donating the money to social causes back home. Add to this a trio of mine locators (one played by Melaine Thierry & another by Paul Walter Hauser) & Lindo's son, played by Jonathan Majors (from Lovecraft Country), become embroiled in the affair after the fence the bloods are engaged with, played by Jean Reno, double crosses them & the long dormant warriors are forced to come back to life. As their well laid plans start to disintegrate before their eyes, loyalties are tested (Lindo becomes the eye of the hurricane as his condition & his past sins overwhelm him). Expertly mixing his usual blend of social commentary (footage from historical figures & events are interspersed into the narrative whenever characters mention them in conversation) & his love of old films into something that is familiar & yet wholly different (especially for viewers who may not get the references or the context). Lee hits another one out of the park wisely showcasing Lindo (after his turns in Malcolm X, Crooklyn & Clockers for him) as his mouthpiece for the ills of a nation. One of the best of 2020.",Da 5 Bloods
29,questl-18592,Da 5 Faces of Lindo,5,30 January 2021,"I had heard such great things about this one going in but I've gotta say, I was disappointed. I think Da 5 Bloods really demonstrates the damage that can be done to a film by a unfocused storyteller. There are a lot of good things here, a lot of good elements but instead of just focusing in on something it feels scattered and all over the place. I rarely like when creators do this, but I feel as though this would have been better as two parts. Part 1 to explore the young, Part 2 for the old or vice versa but mashing it all into one movie while also making comments on institutionalized racism, the horrors of war, PTSD, a treasure hunt movie... It's just too much. It was also really preachy feeling at times. I don't need endless rants on a subject, show don't tell and if you have to tell, do it once. Repeatedly hammering the points home via dialogue is just obnoxious to me and feels grating in every possible way.Delroy Lindo deserves every ounce of praise he gets here but I'm giving this a middling rating because I found myself regularly bouncing between enjoyment and aggravation. I so wanted to enjoy it too, I wanted to love this approach to things but it needs to be honed and focused into something more poignant and intense rather than just scattershot everywhere. It's worth checking out because I'm clearly in the minority here but temper expectations a bit.",Da 5 Bloods
30,valleyjohn,Spike Lee's Prize Turkey,3,15 June 2020,"Say hello to Spike Lee's worst ever film .It's not only his worst film by a long , long way, it's an absolute Turkey in my opinion.I totally get the underlying sentiment of the film. How a disproportionate amount of young black men were sent to Vietnam to fight for a county that treated them so badly ( and still does) but make it a film about that and don't wrap it up in an awful film about retrieving gold and fighting the locals and each other .I'm not exaggerating when I say that at least an hour could have been cut from the film . When they found Storming Norman , I would have been quite happy if it would have ended there . In fact i would have doubled my score if it had but no , we get an extra hour of complete nonsense.All the major studios turned this film down and it was only Netflix that picked it up . You can see why .
It's an incredibly lazy film .
The flashbacks look great with the grainy 16mm film but why on earth didn't they use younger actors ? It looks ridiculous with four pensioners fighting alongside Chadwick Boseman . They couldn't even be bothered to get rid of the grey beards !Another problem I have is the horrendous soundtrack that overpowers the dialogue . It's like the backing music that should be on an epic like Laurence Of Arabia or blockbuster like Indiana Jones . It feels so out of place .If it's a social commentary on the black history of Vietnam you want then you get get a bit of that but for the most it's about a group of so called friends who do nothing but argue with each other for two and a half hours . It gave me a head ache .",Da 5 Bloods
31,TheFearmakers,Treasure Of The Uncommon Apocalypse,5,18 June 2020,"As shown in an archive photo turning up in DA 5 BLOODS, this isn't the first time Delroy Lindo goes to Vietnam. In MORE AMERICAN GRAFFTI he has a quick cameo (credited as Army Sergeant) and now, forty long years later, he's basically the only character in Spike Lee's current joint that means anything...Consisting of four really old African American Vietnam Vets returning to retrieve their deceased leader's/mentor's remains and many bars of gold, BLOODS is a hybrid of THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE for the hunt; UNCOMMON VALOR about a group of returning vets (ten years later/thirty years younger); and COCOON, where some cranky old-timers get a second wind of sorts...So there are the usual old-codger clichés, like aching muscles and pain pills. And by having the men be the same old age in flashbacks, the primary focus is on the only young person in their group, and who puts the 5 into 5 BLOODS: a character called ""Stormin' Norman"" played by Chadwick Boseman, learned more about through present-time adoring exposition than during those war scenes that, exactly like MORE AMERICAN GRAFFITI, are filmed in 16MM to resemble war footage as opposed to your average war movie -- although the grandiose RAMBO-style Gung-Ho score is as popcorn mainstream as they come, clashing with the attempt at a documentary feel...Making the best element of DA 5 BLOODS also the most lazy and predictable... Which is the far-too-easy hiking-trip adventure searching for the gold, and, like TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE had first-billed Humphrey Bogart go bonkers while turning on his fortune-seeking partners, Lindo holds that edgy wild card...And not so ironically, he also wears a MAGA (Donald Trump's Make America Great Again) hat that winds up not only angering/irritating his friends but a Vietnamese soldier and Jean Reno as a French antagonist, who ends up part of a final shootout more suited to cable than the big screen (yet this IS made for Netflix)...There's also a partial love interest, and she too is from France, flirting with the second most important character being related to Delroy Lindo's Paul. Like Patrick Swayze in UNCOMMON VALOR he's a younger non-Veteran: And Jonathan Majors as David also provides most of the levity with bouts of attempted light humor banking off the old dudes -- but nothing really loosens up his intense father, who holds a secret that becomes a pretty decent 11th hour twist.And so, during this current climate of nationwide (even worldwide) protests following the murder of George Floyd, Spike Lee will definitely get nominated and might just, for the first time, win his coveted Oscar -- but it's not deserved since the direction and editing are the most awkward things going...Including random photos and interviews popping up not only before and after the story but during, seeming tacked-on by an idealistic sixth-grader who just wrote an essay on Barack Obama. Meanwhile, the flashbacks and present time stories don't connect all that well. Either way, It's Lindo who should win an Oscar for a performance that goes against all the corniness and preachiness his director constantly throws in...Including a few annoying allegations that fellow white soldiers in Vietnam hated black Americans as much as their North Vietnamese enemy; as if this were the first Vietnam flick involving black soldiers...Growing up on APOCALYPSE NOW (parodied here a few times), Laurence Fishburne and Albert Hall (who both worked for Spike Lee) were as embraced by fans as Robert Duvall, Martin Sheen, Sam Bottoms, Frederic Forrest...And one of this film's most suspenseful scenes involves the younger character stepping on a landmine without being able to step off. Which is straight out of THE BOYS IN COMPANY C where African American Stan Shaw turns in the kind of tour-de-force performance that a breezy melodrama like DA 5 BLOODS couldn't begin to capture, or restrain...But Lindo... God love him... does try his best: despite the interruptions.",Da 5 Bloods
32,jadepietro,Jumble in the Jungle,8,24 June 2020,"GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Well acted but rambling story about five soldiers who come together for some closure.JIM'S REVIEW: Streaming directly to Netflix and avoiding movie theaters which are still shuttered anyway, Spike Lee's war drama. Da 5 Bloods, takes moviegoers on a long and rambling journey back to the traumas caused by the Vietnam war to our vets and our country. The story may not always be successful in its execution, too much of a Black History 101 lecture, but it does delve into a dark chapter of America's history and makes very relevant points about racism, greed, and honor that we need to continue to discuss during today's harrowing times.Five African-American Vietnam vets, dubbed the ""Bloods"", reunite in Ho Chi Minh City with a personal mission: to bring back the remains of their fallen comrade and friend, ""Stormin' Norman"" Holloway (Chadwick Boseman). An honorable quest, but there is also an ulterior motive: They also want to retrieve hidden gold bars that these soldiers had buried on a previous operation. While there, these five men will deal with their own personal demons and encounter many obstacles and physical hardships along the way.Clarke Peters plays Otis, the leader of this band of brothers. He visits his former girlfriend, Tiên, who helps him make contacts with a French businessman, Desroche (Jean Reno), who will ensure their safety and buy the gold from them. Also on this mission is Paul, (a wonderful Delroy Lindo...more on him later). Paul is Otis' close friend who suffers from PTSD and carries the guilt and anger of a nation with him. He is a widower who has an estranged relationship with son, David (Jonathan Majors), who came along to Paul's surprise. Paul becomes the catalyst in this multi-layered story and provides the conflict within the Bloods. He is a Trump supporter and his many debates with the others spring from his opposing point of view and set up the tension.As the film goes back and forth in its narrative from 60's war-time Vietnam to present-day, the journey itself becomes a tad strained and far-fetched, with some secondary characters, such as three crusaders from a organization dedicated to clearing landmines, popping up unexpectedly (and all too conveniently) to advanced the plot. Their roles cause the story to stretch plausibility, as do some of the film's other intruders. The screenplay simply needs more clarity and some of the other supporting characters are sketchy and not as well developed, specifically the other remaining soldiers, Eddie and Melvin (Norm Lewis and Isiah Whitlock Jr.). However, the film's many monologues are always very literate and thought-provoking. After all, with Mr. Lee, it's the message that is of the upmost concern.The director's trademarked continued use of archival footage effectively shows viewers the turbulent era of the sixties for African-Americans, both here and abroad. He chronicles black life and the poor treatment inflicted by the U.S. government. While the assassination of Martin Luther King back home created civil unrest and racial divides, these men were still expected to fight for a country that treated them in second class servitude. Yet sometimes the newsreel montages interfere with the main story and begin to overstate the message, choosing to sacrifice the movie's narrative and plot.The acting is solid throughout the film. Mr. Peters is quite convincing as the troubled Otis who tries to negotiate between all of the bickering. Mr. Boseman, as the doomed soldier, creates a strong impression, although he has less screen time than the others. Mr. Majors is very memorable as Paul's forgotten son and he has some tender scenes with French actress Mélanie Thierry as one of the volunteers that register. One wishes the talented Mr. Lewis and Mr. Whitlock were given more to do with their characters, even though both actors bring needed depth to their perfunctory roles. But it is Mr. Lindo who creates a complex and beaten man just trying to survive. His Paul is haunted and haunting. This excellent actor is outstanding, especially in his lengthy tirades about injustice and his delusional conversations with himself. His performance deserves Oscar recognition.Mr. Lee directs with his usual flair, but the story itself is a jumble at times. The ending seems too glib and uplifting. Its storytelling lacks a true sense of irony, anger, and gravitas which the film wishes to achieve. Still Da 5 Bloods is fine filmmaking, very worthy of your time and support, but my expectations remain higher for this great filmmaker and his vision.",Da 5 Bloods

The film is 2.5 hours long and it should of been 2 max. The flashbacks to the war (50 years ago) had the same actors with no attempt to make them younger.

36,Jeremy_Urquhart,"Won't convert non-fans of Spike Lee, but I thought it was one of his best yet",8,8 July 2020,"I've never disliked a Spike Lee movie, but I'm often a little mixed (Black KKKlansman for example had some great stuff, but I couldn't quite get it to 4/5 personally).This one surprised me by how much I liked it. It's impressive because it doesn't feel like a movie made by a man in his 60s- there's a real energy and vibrancy to it. I haven't seen all his movies, and might need to reflect on it a little more, but this is second only to his classic Do The Right Thing, in my opinion.It's very well-paced for a 2.5 hour movie, with an opening third that is comparatively slower (but still important as far as setup goes), it's beautifully shot (a couple of slightly clunky CGI effects shots aside), the acting is amazing, and on top of having the political and societal commentary one expects out of a Spike Lee film, it's also just a very engaging, oftentimes very intense, character driven story.It satisfies very well as both a piece of entertainment and as a work of art intended to give its audience some food for thought.
I could see complaints against a lack of subtlety- however, he's highlighting many issues that shouldn't still be cultural problems, so maybe that lack of nuance is somewhat justified.And it's not a criticism, more a warning that it is a particularly violent war movie. There's some brief Vietnam War footage in the opening and then also about 2/3s of the way through, that is definitely intended to shock and disturb.The length and confronting themes/images mean it's not for everyone, but for fans of Spike Lee- or anyone wanting to see something dramatically satisfying yet also sometimes quite unconventional- it's a must watch.",Da 5 Bloods

38,blott2319-1,"Brilliant, thrilling, and timely",9,12 June 2020,"There is so much to love about Da 5 Bloods, and I think it has something to offer several different audiences. Let's see if I can break it all down for you:If you're looking for a film that feels like a war movie, and has action and excitement to spare, then I think you'll get just what you want out of Da 5 Bloods. I was thrilled by all these sequences, and often couldn't believe my eyes as the violence escalated. It was a truly remarkable and downright disturbing thing to watch. Whoever handled the effects on this film did a masterful job at making the violence feel real and horrifying, even in the times when the blood splatter was clearly CGI. Spike Lee also knows how to film the action, so even in the chaos of battle, you can keep a tab on where people are and what is happening to our heroes.However, if you're looking for a film about the bonds of friendship forged in war, Da 5 Bloods has that in spades. We get to see these men who have grown close over the years, and on this journey they find common ground and discuss the past, present, and future. It didn't take long before I felt like I knew these men and could see what brought them together and what threatened to come between them. It's not always smooth sailing and we get to see how they all deal with conflict. It's a heart-wrenching journey at times, and I was close to tears more than once. You start to realize that, even with all the crazy stuff happening, it's the bonds of friendship and love that are the most vital.Finally, if you're looking for a film that talks about the history of racism in both America and Vietnam, then look no further than Da 5 Bloods. Spike Lee opens the film with one of his patented montages of news footage from the past that details some of the things this film will address (or puts certain aspects of it in context.) Throughout the movie he will even insert shots of news reports or printed media when someone references a historic moment from the past, as if he wants to make it clear to viewers that this movie may be fictional, but the events they are discussing really happened. There is symbolism in other ways throughout the film that calls back to the racial themes.There might be even more to Da 5 Bloods that flew over my head, but these are the three most obvious genres you'll find when watching this film. Now I'll admit, some of the more political stuff that he addresses would turn me off in some movies. It serves as a distraction from the plot, and I don't enjoy when a film-maker takes extra time just to hammer home the themes instead of addressing them in an organic way in the story. However, there's something about this moment in history that made me forgive Spike Lee's choices here. This doesn't seem like a time to be subtle, and perhaps Da 5 Bloods is the slap in the face some people need. In every other way I loved this movie, and it's one of those rare films that I want to watch repeatedly so I can analyze and pick it apart to see what I missed the first time. It now claims the title as my favorite Spike Lee film.",Da 5 Bloods
39,bankofmarquis,Delroy Lindo shines in a mostly good film,8,19 June 2020,"Over the years, I have become a fan of Spike Lee. I think he has a singular vision as a filmmaker with his films putting a spotlight on the black experience and the prejudices and injustices that prevail.DA 5 BLOODS - Lee's Vietnam War movie - is no exception.Set in present(ish) day and in the memories of the main characters from their time ""in country"", DA 5 BLOODS tells the tale of 4 Vietnam Veterans who return to find the body of their squadron leader - and the gold that they buried under his body.Part Vietnam war flick, part gold heist (and the cost of this theft on the hearts and minds of the participants) and part reflection on the treatment of the black soldiers, Lee reaches high to combine 3 separate - and complex - films into one (any one of which could have been a film of their own) and it is here that this films succeeds - and fails. For this film is at moments riveting, at moments unflinching and hard to watch, at moments confusing and at moments...surprisingly... dull. Spike had a lot of movie to tell and he took 2 and a 1/2 hours to tell it. He would have been better suited to cut some of this down to a more palatable 2-ish hour length. The film bogs down on itself at times.But when it crackles - it crackles. Especially when the 4 veteran soldiers interact with each other. Led by the great Delroy Lindo (TV's THE GOOD FIGHT). I hope that this film gets a theatrical release sometime (to make it eligible for the Oscars) for Lindo's portrayal of MAGA Hat wearing, PTSD suffering Paul is powerful and captivating. I was riveted by his performance and I was willing to follow him to the ends of the Earth. Also standing out is Clarke Peters as Otis - the heart and soul of this group and Norm Lewis, the pigeon-toed Eddie who has a secret that he is hiding. Both of these characters shine at moments - but are not in the spotlight nearly often enough. The same can be said for Isaih Whitlock Jr as Melvin, a character that is undeserved until the end and by then I felt myself wanting more of him. (Side Note: Lee named these characters after members of THE TEMPTATIONS).Lee makes an interesting choice in the flashback scenes of the war. Instead of casting younger actors or spending the $$ on ""de-aging"" the actors (Lee would say that the de-aging was ""cost prohibitive""), Lee chooses to have these old guys just play their younger versions of themselves just as they are now, claiming that these are not flashbacks, but ""memories"" of these soldiers - and I gotta admit that this tactic works very, very well - especially when these 4 older gentlemen are in the Vietnam War scenes with their Platoon Leader played, charismatically, by the much younger Chadwick Boseman. His character is killed in action and since these scenes are memories, it works well that he is younger (he never got a chance to grow old) while all the others are older. Boseman has a an attraction to him that helps the audience buy into the fact that all these years later these 4 men still hold him front and center in their memories. Unfortunately, the combat scenes looks to me like they were done on a shoe-string budget, so Lee has to use ""tricks"" to pull these scenes off and these tricks bring these scenes down a peg.As I've stated, this film is really 3 films in one and the effects of the gold on the men is the most interesting part of this film for me, it touches on the desires of the human soul and brings some of the strongest acting and emotions.This being a Spike Lee joint, this film is peppered with scenes from the black experience - from Martin Luther KIng to Malcom X to ""Hanoi Hannah"" telling the black troops that their country is abandoning them. These are important events in the lives and psyche of these men (and African Americans) and Mr. Lee is uniquely positioned to bring the attention of the public to these events, and he does it well.DA 5 BLOODS in now streaming on Netflix.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Da 5 Bloods

41,Sir_AmirSyarif,Bold storytelling,7,22 June 2020,"Bold storytelling, like in most Spike Lee joints, but 'Da 5 Bloods' goes off the rail about halfway through when the stories become disjointed and a bit unfocused. Lee's choices of intercutting the movie's narrative with footages of real world struggles and tragedies can also be distracting at times. Still, going in with unexpected grisly directions while exploring ideas of pride and paranoia in the wake of harrowing experiences, 'Da 5 Bloods' remains interesting and engaging to watch.",Da 5 Bloods
42,kjproulx,"An Emotionally Riveting, Essential Piece of Filmmaking",10,18 June 2020,"When it comes to Spike Lee films, I've now come to expect a film that's at least good. Do the Right Thing is one of my favourite films of all time and BlacKkKlansman easily made my Top 10 list of 2018. It's very clear when you're watching a Spike Lee joint (as he likes to call them). Da 5 Bloods is his most recent directorial outing and streaming seems to be the saving grace for a lot of movies this year. Netflix has recently released it for all subscribers to view, and although a lot of the subject matter may be a lot to take in, I believe, especially due to the timing of the release and how it relates to society today, it is an essential piece of filmmaking.After losing one of their own in war, four American veterans return to where they lost him in order to uncover his body, as well as try to find the gold that they hid away. After this film sets the overall story in motion, it becomes a long, slow journey from beginning to end, but it's very much worth the investment. Becoming close with what seems to be new allies, a new plot begins to unfold, adding a huge layer of reality to the movie as a whole. It was very hard not to compare the notions throughout this film to that of the ones we're dealing with today, and for that reason alone, I believe this film is even more impactful than it already was upon completion.This film begins with real images and footage that are incredibly impactful and eye-opening. Throughout the movie, real images are cut to in order to exploit the harsh realities of certain things. That small aspect of the movie alone will be too much for some to handle. There are some horrific images that are not recreated for the movie, but rather just blatantly displayed on-screen, conveying some of the most emotional messages I've seen in a film in quite some time. On top of that, this movie relies heavily on the characters at the forefront of the story and if you don't buy their chemistry and their history together, this movie would've been a mess. Thankfully, there are some award-worthy performances here from everyone involved.In particular, as most viewers have been proclaiming, Delroy Lindo as Paul delivers one of the very best performances I've seen in a while. His screen presence here is electric and if any of the awards shows were coming soon, I could even make the argument that he deserves to win. He truly brings his A-Game here and I've never seen him better. Granted, this is the most acting I've ever seen from him, so it left quite an impression on me. In addition, Isiah Whitlock Jr., Norm Lewis, Clarke Peters, and the eventual joining of Jonathan Majors, all played off each other as if they were real-life friends. The acting in this film is off the charts.Written by Danny Bilson, Kevin Willmott, Spike Lee, and Paul De Meo, it was very clear that this was a collaborative effort. This film came from the heart and I was most surprised to see Paul De Meo's name attached. He's had his hand in writing video games in recent years, but in terms of feature films, his last notable screenplay was for The Rocketeer in 1991. I really hope to see him return to feature film screenplays in the future. From the way each character interacts with each other to the long monologues given (particularly by Lindo), this movie had me glued to the screen.In the end, Da 5 Bloods is an eye-opening film, to say the least. The story itself is very telling in its own right, but when you compare certain elements to our daily lives, this can be a huge lesson for some viewers. As I said, certain imagery will be too much for viewers to take in, so be wary if you're either squeamish or know that certain things will be stuck in your mind forever. Filled with a stellar cast, backed by superb direction, and written with a lot of care, Da 5 Bloods is a must-see. It's now streaming on Netflix and I highly recommend checking it out. It's also quite possibly the best movie that will be released for a while as well.",Da 5 Bloods
43,AhmedSpielberg99,Da Spike Lee!,7,14 June 2020,"Gotta admit that I found the archival footage and some preachy dialogue to be very distracting and off-putting for most of the first hour of the movie. Regardless, Da 5 Bloods is, like many other Spike Lee's joints, a helluva powerful movie. Unlike what I've seen by Spike Lee though, this one is truly thought-provoking because it really has a multi-layered narrative that explores a plethora of ideas on a superficial level and also on a substantive one. Plus, this is quite possibly the only movie about Vietnam war that's actually insightful and informative. So, this is quite something, I guess. I really admired that Spike Lee doesn't shy away from revealing uncomfortable truths about the Vietnam war almost as much as he doesn't shy away from showing sudden, and shocking, outbursts of violence and blood. Using variety of aspect ratios and colour correcting techniques were also truly impressive. And oh, the editing, just masterful! What is most astounding to consider about this effort, though, is how brilliantly it is disguised as an adventure film. I mean, this is as entertaining and smart as a decent adventure film can get. So, you don't really have any right to find its two-and-half hour runtime daunting. Last but not least, Delroy Lindo definitely deserves an Oscar for his performance here. His character, Paul, is the type of protagonists that attribute to the story and its messages on almost every level, and Lindo really couldn't have done it more justice.(7.5/10)",Da 5 Bloods
44,mahmus,"An entertaining and gripping war drama that like even the most serious Spike Lee movies, has a lot of great comedy.",8,15 June 2020,"Then again, this isn't one of Spike Lee's most serious films, or at least it's one of his less angry films. For all its relevant commentary on racism, this is primarily an adventure film, and a damn good one at that. It is also a great tribute to all black soilders who fought in the Vietnam war. It's a story about unity, which I think it's something we could all use right now.It's full of references to classic movies, some more effective than others.
It's perhaps a bit too similar to The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Many of its story beats are lifted directly from that film (of course they recreate the ""stinking badges"" scene), so having seen that movie did remove a lot of the tension, and made the latter parts of the second half somewhat predictable.That landmine scene however is one of the tensest movie scenes I've seen in a while.Also, I love how no other movie could possibly get away with having the villain straight up wearing a MAGA hat during a shootout. It would be painfully unsubtle if it wasn't such a hilarious visual.",Da 5 Bloods
45,MrDHWong,"A timely and engrossing ""Joint"" from the renowned filmmaker that never relents on its controversial themes",9,12 November 2020,"""Da 5 Bloods"" is a war drama film co-written and directed by Spike Lee (Do the Right Thing, BlacKkKlansman). Starring Delroy Lindo, Clarke Peters, Norm Lewis, Isiah Whitlock Jr., and Chadwick Boseman, it is a timely and engrossing ""Joint"" from the renowned filmmaker that never relents on its controversial themes.In the Vietnam War, a group of five African-American soldiers referred to as the ""Bloods"", Paul (Delroy Lindo), Otis (Clarke Peters), Melvin (Isiah Whitlock Jr.), Eddie (Norm Lewis), and their leader Norman (Chadwick Boseman), discover a large case of gold bars in the wreckage of a crashed US plane. Deciding to keep the gold for themselves, the Bloods bury the case of bars in the dirt with the intention of retrieving it much later on. However, a napalm strike destroys the nearby identifying landmarks, making it near impossible for the Bloods to relocate the exact spot where the case was buried and to make matters worse, Norman is later killed in the ensuing gunfire with retaliating North Vietnamese soldiers. In the present, Paul, Otis, Melvin, and Eddie, along with Paul's son David (Jonathan Majors), return to Vietnam in an attempt to finally retrieve the gold and bring Norman's remains back to US soil.Spike Lee has always been a filmmaker who has never held back on telling stories that will provoke discussion among audiences. His visceral and often confrontational perspective of the world around him has left a large impact on not only the film industry itself but also of the politically motivated who see his movies as an important critique on the serious problems still faced in modern American society. In ""Da 5 Bloods"", we have a showcase of how the director sees the presence of African-American soldiers during one of the most controversial wars of the twentieth century. These five black men are shown to be just as committed to serving their country as their fellow white soldiers, bonding over their determination to both each other and who they are fighting for in the first place. This allowed for some great scenes involving the Bloods working together to break through the boundaries of any race related issues that would usually arise back home in America, instead depicting them as yet another branch of US soldiers battling the enemy in a foreign land. From the beginning, it is clear that Lee wants us to get to know each and every one of these men and their backstories, which sets itself up for some powerful dramatic moments during the film's climax. Not all of these moments have the same amount of impact, but the ones that do will definitely leave an impression on many viewers.Most of Lee's directorial trademarks are here; the primarily African-American cast, the themes of racism and discrimination, the intersplicing of real news footage and still images in relation to a particular scene, and characters directly addressing the camera as if they were talking to the audience. All of these help remind us that this is indeed a Spike Lee ""Joint"" and that we need to take seriously what he is trying to communicate over to us. Lee also includes some not-so-subtle references to other Vietnam War films such as ""Apocalypse Now"", which was a nice touch during certain parts where the Bloods were journeying back into the depths of the jungle after so many decades. But best of all is how Lee is able to build that sense of anticipation as to what caused the death of the Bloods' leader Norman. Throughout the film, the audience is left in the dark as to how exactly Norman was killed in the first place and Lee manages to string us along until near the very end when we are finally shown all the details. This alone kept a viewer like me highly invested in the story, especially since this film has a runtime of 155 minutes, and surprisingly there aren't any scenes that drag on too long.Each cast member gave convincing, well-acted performances, with the main highlight being Delroy Lindo as Paul. Lindo, who has worked on three prior films with Lee, plays his character with a tragic amount of realism, as he is wrought with PTSD and regret over his experiences of fighting in such an unpopular war. His interactions with his fellow Bloods added so much tension and drama that at times it almost felt as though he was the one solely carrying the film. I also enjoyed the late Chadwick Boseman as the team leader Norman. Although all of his scenes are shown in flashbacks, we easily get the sense that he is someone who has earned the respect of his fellow teammates and understand why they wish to bring him home for a proper burial. Before his passing in August 2020, this was the last film Boseman starred in to be released during his lifetime and it feels like a fitting one to help remember him by.As of late, it feels as though Spike Lee is on a role with films fitting in with the current political narrative. His previous film, 2018's ""BlacKkKlansman"", showed how racism is still a prevalent issue today whereas this one shows how a considerable percentage of African-Americans contributed strongly to helping the US during a war the country did not end up winning. It seems so long as there are problems with the African-American population fitting in with the rest of society, Spike Lee will have something important to say on the matter. With that, I think we should sit back and listen to him.I rate it a solid 9/10",Da 5 Bloods
46,Alexander_Blanchett,A Spike Lee Vietnam Joint,9,12 June 2020,"A fantastic Spike Lee joint and his ideal view on the Vietnam war and its aftermath in some aspects. The film is in its essence a typical Spike Lee feature with many weird characters, unexpected story developments and all of that stands for something, some message he wants to provide, sometimes it is conventionally done sometimes really out of the box. This film has it all. It is still one of Lee's more conventional films but if you expect a straight forward Vietnam war drama you are in the wrong seat. This is not your Oliver Stone kind of ""anti war drama"". I loved how Lee created the characters as most of them stand for something that is not going too well in our world these days, and others stand for something more positive. Acting wise it was good. Delroy Lindo is great in the most central role of the film. And so is Clark Peters who is definitely one of the stand outs and the character you can root most for. A very important supporting role is filled by Chadwick Boseman who perfectly fits into the environment of a Spike Lee film and I hope they will collaborate more often in the future. Also Jean Reno has his moments, even if his character is rather unlikeable. The technical aspects of the film are more great, fantastic cinematography, wonderful editing and awesome score.
The creative decision to use the same actors in the flashbacks as in present is ambitious and something you have to get used to but in the end it makes sense, and works, even without digital de-aging.
A film that couldn't be more relevant for these days and a film I expect to go places.",Da 5 Bloods
47,cliftonofun,"Historical, current, and timeless all at once",8,13 June 2020,"Only Spike could make this film...and it is his best in a LONG time. He somehow combines a little Treasure of the Sierra Madre, a little Three Kings, and a lot of Marvin Gaye into an outright masterpiece. Not only that, but along the way he reminds us how many of our greatest supporting actors (Delroy Lindo, Clarke Peters, Isiah Whitlock Jr) could have been absolute stars in a parallel universe. The entire film feels so original and so familiar, which is not easy to pull off. When you are in Vietnam, you are transported to another era and place. When you are with these characters, you are reminded of the current moment. And yet it is timeless all the same. There have not been many films this year, but this was a reminder of what great stories can do. Let's have an Oscar ceremony just for Spike and Delroy Lindo. It will be well deserved.",Da 5 Bloods
48,elicopperman,PTSD from the POV of Scarred Black Lives,8,23 June 2020,"PTSD comes in all wavering factors, whether from psychological abuse, or childhood trauma, or especially fighting in a deadly war between countries. In the case of the latest Spike Lee joint, Da 5 Bloods, this flick really delves into how the effects of the Vietnam War can screw up the lives of individuals, specifically African Americans. The fact that this film was released when a jingoistic arrogant prejudiced white man is still in America's office pretending to run things adds into the hypocrisies commonplace in the land of the free. Just when we think a war is over, it comes back in ways we would never expect.The story centers around a group of aging Vietnam War veterans who return to said country in search of both their late squad leader and a treasure they buried while serving there. From the getco, the movie is driven just as much by its characters as its plot, maybe a little more so, mainly due to their individual personalities. Although these veterans served in the army, they all came out differently, such as Otis (Clarke Peters) having a more lenient soft spot for the country personally, Eddie (Norm Lewis) having achieved success after his time, or Melvin (Isiah Whitlock jr.) being the sardonic jokester of the group. However, the biggest standout would have to be the aggressively ill-tempered Paul, elevated through an all-star performance by Delroy Lindo. In addition to having a rocky relationship with his son David (Jonathan Majors), who tags along on the crew's journey, the amount of anger seethed inside him from serving such an unnecessary war practically poisons him into becoming his own villain. You know a cast is intriguing when you debate whether to root for these elders or not.But what would be a solid search movie without a good amount of foes to add into the tension? In the case of Da 5 Bloods, for every trustworthy component like the group's guide Vinh (Johnny Tri Nguyen), and Otis' former flame Tien (Le Y Lan), there are the more shady opponents attempting to be in the way of them. For instance, the shady French businessman Desroche (Jean Reno), plays up the heist well in manipulating the men into their journey under false pretenses of payback (th French were also fairly ruthless in Vietnam mind you). Along the way, the group meet up with foreign experts like French woman Hedy Bouvier (Mélanie Thierry), Simon (Paul Walter Hauser) and Seppo (Jasper Pääkkönen), who all seem superfluous until the film's latter half raises up the violence and stakes to frightening results. All throughout the feature, these side characters play key factors in either playing along the main group's goals or trying to do anyway with them, emphasizing who to trust and who not to trust in an otherwise divisive traumatized pack of veterans.Throughout the feature, Lee cleverly intertwines stock footage to emphasize the tangents in the main story and the media brought during the war's period. Whether it'd be used to parallel the speeches of famous icons like Martin Luther King or Muhammad Ali between the poor Vietnamese citizens vs the poor Blacks, or to add in to how little has changed since these disgusting war years, this footage can often come at the expense of making viewers, based on their race and class, think long and hard about the effects that this period had on America. Another fascinating filmmaking choice is shooting the flashback sequences of the group and the aforementioned Norman on 16mm and without making the actors look young, possibly indicating that the Bloods never truly left Vietnam (as Vinh pointed out) due to how much it came back to haunt them all. If there is any notable flaw in the movie, it's that perhaps the 2.5 hour runtime can be rather tiresome depending on the viewer's interest, and the few moments of humor don't always mesh well with the overall serious tone.It's not often when a war film really goes into the harsh realities of American citizens who were affected by its country through a pointless battle worse than others. Da 5 Bloods stands as a bold and brutally honest feature about America's perception of Blackness that seems to have lingered on since 1619, ""whether in heroic situations or human ones,"" (Odie Henderson). Whether you're a Spike Lee fan, a war-movie buff or are interested in viewing pro-black media during these crazy times, this is right up your alley. After all, what does it really mean to be a war hero at the end of the day?",Da 5 Bloods
49,ronakkotian,A mixed bag of feelings,5,21 June 2020,"Spike Lee is one of the most interesting filmmakers out there. His films have a lot to say and he isn't afraid to voice his opinions. I thought BlacKkKlansman was pretty good but this film is definitely a step down from that.Da 5 Bloods is about four soldiers that return to Vietnam years after fighting in the Vietnam War and try to find their fallen squadron leader and the gold they all hid.This film really put me on the fence. There are parts of it which I like and other areas which I didn't like. I get what Spike Lee was trying to convey relating to African Americans in the war and the problems with it but I feel his execution of the subject was lacklustre.A few things I did enjoy were the four main cast members. At the very beginning of the film I really felt a sense of camaraderie between them and I especially liked watching Delroy Lindo's performance throughout. The use of archival footage added to the realism of the film with some creating a very intense and uncomfortable feeling to the viewer. I thought the changing aspect ratios worked for the most part. The war scenes that were shot in 4:3 seemed like footage that was actually filmed long ago.Apart from that, the film is flawed. A huge technique which bothered me throughout was how Lee wanted to tell the audience the film's themes. There are many moments where the characters just talk about the film's themes without us trying to figure it out ourselves. It gets to a point where it feels preachy. Clearly subtlety is not a strong factor in this film. There's a sequence where a character miraculously finds something which seemed way too convenient for that to happen. The dialogue was pretty bland and I wasn't a fan of some of the editing choices. With a runtime of 2 hours 30 minutes, it could've been cut down to be a tad shorter as some scenes drag.I don't think Da 5 Bloods is as bad as some people say it is or as good as some critics say it is. There are good parts to it but it's unfortunate Lee took a few bad decisions to convey a story that had potential. You can watch it if you want but I would skip out on this one.",Da 5 Bloods

But this movie is very entertaining and has Spike Lee's artistic touch all over it. I didn't like the starting phase of the movie but as it went along and when the story unfolds slowly, it began to take my attention. The music and the cinematography is very good and the shots in Vietnam forest was very good. The performances of the whole cast was top notch and some deserves Oscar recognition. As for the whole movie, eventhough it may get nominated in some category, I don't think this will be in the Best Picture nominee.

51,saadanathan,Well achieved film 8/10,8,14 June 2020,"Spike Lee is known for his political movies, sometimes I like them and sometimes I don't know what to say about them. I believe in every movie of his he has to criticize America and everyone's action. Even at the end of the movie you see the movie focuses on today's events in America which i would have preferred to put aside and focus on the story itself. Not politics. With that being said I loved this film. The script was genius and original. Characters who feel real and audience can identify with them. Chadwick Boseman's character Stormin Norman is probably the best character Spike Lee wrote. Cool, leader, brave and smart. The heart of the squad. Without him the group felt lost and you can see on screen how lost they are without his guidance. Another problem I found with this film was the flashbacks to the Vietnam war: in those flashbacks, the group of veterans are seen fighting along their leader Norman. But Norman is young while the others are still old just like in the main timeline. It's like watching ""The Irishman"" but with no de - aging. There are no young stunts playing the characters and no makeup, nor CGI in order to make them look young. I don't know if it's on purpose but it affects the movie really bad. There are a lot of other characters in the movie that don't have much value and so you're not surprised that they are dead. Overall I loved the movie, Paul, Otis, Eddie and Melvin are great and funny characters that fans could identify with easley. A fine cast of actors and good cinematography along with nice editing with footage and videos of the past.",Da 5 Bloods
52,andrewroy-04316,"Da 5 Bloods is exactly the type of ambitious, cluttered, anything but subtle movie you'd expect from Spike Lee",6,28 June 2020,"Much as I felt Once Upon a Time In Hollywood was pure, unadulterated Tarantino, Da 5 Bloods feels like pure Spike Lee (though granted I haven't seen nearly enough of Lee's films to say anything holistic). It's a tense, action-filled film that is filled with modern and historical commentary, not just in themes but by Spike using archival footage as well. The best and clearest point Lee makes in the film is the experience of black soldiers in Vietnam. As with all the other ideas in the film, they're explicitly thrown at you in dialogue, but there is so much to dig into in regards to the intersections of war, race, and the way history propagates forwards. I am fully on the Delroy Lindo train along with everyone else, as he is fantastic in every scene, and also love Jonathan Majors as his son. I really liked the way the historical flashbacks had a narrower aspect ratio and emphasized the way the men still feel like they're in the war mentally. At the same time, the events in the film did feel so ham-fisted and strange at times as to limit immersion. The character interactions are just non-stop fighting, and obviously the struggling vets with PTSD will have their moments, but this is also a team that cares so much about each other that the complete inability to work out situations reasonably was baffling to me. Lee hits us over the head with how greed influences their decisions, but we don't get enough of a sense of their modern lives to understand why they care so much about the gold. It didn't bother me as much when I watched it, but thinking about it now I do also see how the Vietnamese people were painted with very broad, stereotypical strokes and Lee doesn't combine his racism-related points with imperialist-related points. It's certainly entertaining and has lots of ideas, but all of those ideas were shoved at us with no nuance and the character development outside of Lindo's Paul was mediocre. Worth watching, and overall a good film, but not a memorable one.",Da 5 Bloods

Unbelievable flashbacks with 70 year old men as 20 year old soldiers. Fake Comraderie of guys that haven't seen each other for decades. A really, really bad soundtrack. And what seemed like very poor direction. If you're a huge Lee fan maybe, otherwise just can't recommend it.",Da 5 Bloods
54,mmthos,SUPERIOR,8,14 June 2020,"One of Spike's best, to my mind, done in the style of great war movies (Longest Day, River Kwai, et al.)
5 distinct personalities, each contributing a different aspect of the black experience in Nam and beyond, amplified by news footage of the time.
Delroy Lindo tears it up as the Madman (Oscar worthy), maybe a little too much-not his acting, but maybe his long rants added up to too much screen time, relative to the film overall, throwing the rhythm off a bit. That said, no question that his character was rightfully the focus of the story's intentions.
And flashbacks required 60 year-old actors to play themselves as youths, an unfortunate distraction, but probably better than cgi-ing youth on their faces, which would have been even more distracting.
All and all, very distinguished work, Mr. Lee and crew!",Da 5 Bloods
55,danielcereto,Worst Spike Lee movie,3,7 November 2020,"I like most of Spike Lee movies but this one is embarassing. First, ¿how can the main characters being on the same age 60 years ago?... Watchers are not dumb. Second, CGI are pretty bad looks like a B-movie. Last, 3 stars because of the beautiful Vietnam real settings. That's all. Worst Spike Lee movie by far. Shame on him.",Da 5 Bloods
56,PyroSikTh,As Powerful as it is Laughable,7,30 September 2020,"Da 5 Bloods is a story of a group of black Vietnam War veterans going back to retrieve their fallen comrade some fifty years later, and pick up some treasure they buried out in the jungle while they're at it. But while the film's narrative is largely as simple as that, it finds complexity in the smaller details. This is a movie about trauma, how it never goes away, and can leave you feeling like you're fighting a war long after that war is over. Because war is never over. There's always something to fight about. These veterans were placed on the frontlines due to the colour of their skin, and came back home to the same civil rights fights they had to deal with before. Their war never ended, it just shifted location and target.Lee underlines this by including a myriad of real-life footage across the movie's runtime, drawing parallels between the atrocities of the Vietnam War and the American civil rights movements of the 60s and 70s. On numerous occasions he draws direct links between the suffrage of the Vietnam people, both north and south, and the black communities of America. Whether this comparison is a historically valid one is up for debate, but it's hard to argue the similarities as presented by Lee. We see lines of dead Americans after violent protests followed by imagery of Vietnamese being shot and killed without remorse. Every time a real-life hero is mentioned, they flash up on screen with a small detail, bringing an authenticism to what Lee's trying to say. This inevitably makes the movie a very hard watch. There is imagery in this movie that will stick with me for life, and I'm on the fence over whether I appreciated with approach or not. Seeing a guy get shot in the head at point blank range, and knowing that it wasn't fake, is a harrowing experience, as is seeing the brutalised corpses of children sans special effects. When Lee wants to make his point, he really hammers it home, forces you to see it. It becomes more than just a footnote in history and becomes a real, shared experience of human atrocity regardless of race or nationality.Lee is also remarkably unbiased when it comes to his treatment of the right wing as well, which considering how outspokenly left-leaning he is, I found it not only surprising for him, but refreshing for an American movie in general. Hollywood is a largely left-wing society, so to see a right-wing character depicted with respect and depth was simply amazing. And I say that as someone who leans left as well. The character of Paul is testament of character depth and ultimate humanity in a fictional character. One of the first things we learn about him is how unashamedly racist he is towards Asian people, openly confessing to being a Trump supporter, and wears a red MAGA hat almost throughout. And yet he's built up through the course of the movie to be shockingly easy to empathise with. He's equal parts protagonist and antagonist, letting his paranoia take over him as he commits less than savoury acts not only against others, but his own brothers-in-arms as well. And yet Lee makes it abundantly clear that all of this is a result of a lifetime of trauma. The Vietnam War never left him. He is haunted every night by the ghost of his dead squad mate, and feels immeasurable guilt for his part in Norm's death. He comes back home, falls in love, and loses his wife during childbirth. He blames his son for the death of his wife and becomes abusive. While his abhorrent behaviour is never excused, his background, and the life he's lived, makes it easy to understand how he has turned out the way he has. And rather than vilify him, the movie shows how tragic it is that a man can fall so far against his own friends, his own race, his own son.The biggest shame is that none of the other characters get quite the same degree of attention. Otis is given a bit in the form of Tien and her daughter, as well as his staunch morality, but Eddie and Melvin barely exist as characters at all. David, Paul's son, obviously gets a little dash of attention to, but it's more by association than anything. We don't really get a glimpse into the kind of life he's led after a childhood of abuse, he's more of a vessel to show us how bad Paul can be, as well as why.The acting performances in this movie are honestly top-shelf from all involved, with Delroy Lindo being the obvious stand-out. He's given the most complicated character to portray and he doesn't miss a beat. The way he careens through politeness, racist outbursts, and trauma-laden breakdown is heartbreaking to watch, and his fourth-wall breaking monologues late into the movie's runtime show the true depth of madness his character has sunken to. Jonathan Majors is also a heavy hitter, sometimes running rings around his more experienced castmates. He's exploded onto the scene this year and it's easy to see how. The late Chadwick Boseman, in his last ever filmed role, is also heartbreakingly solid. Him playing a character already dead by the time the movie begins was particularly upsetting. Clark Peters brings his usual gravitas and easy-to-like demeanour to Otis, and all praise Isiah Whitlock Jr. for bringing back the delightful ""shiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeet"" from his character in The Wire. The older actors also did a decent job of playing their younger selves in the flashback scenes as well. While I did find this a little jarring initially, it made it easy to identify who was who, saved itself the risk and expense of de-aging, and changed the whole intention of those scenes, turning them from flashbacks into memories, or the shared trauma these guys have, and really hammering home that Norm never got to grow old like the rest of them.
On a more technical merit the film can be really hit or miss. The cinematography is some of the best I've seen for a while, using different aspect ratios, film quality, and lighting and colouring techniques to differentiate different moods, settings, moments, and ideas. Almost all the flashback scenes are in 4:3 and riddled with film grain to embody the old documentary footage of the 70s, giving a sense of realism to those sequences, while the interactions in the modern day are filmed in a more traditional letterboxed format. And then once they hit the jungle, the ratio blows out to a full IMAX 16:9. After an hour of letterbox and 4:3 aspect ratios, to suddenly blow out that far to show the full breadth of the Vietnam wilderness was an honestly mind-blowing experience.That said, the music is truly horrendous and ill-fitting. The a cappella Marvin Gaye tracks were wrought with emotional weight and fit these characters extremely well, but the score by Terence Blanchard was just wrong through and through. It sounded like the cheesy orchestral scores you'd expect to find in a propaganda piece, filled with brass and snare rolls, and melancholically inspiring melodies that never lingered, but constantly shifted and changed, robbing the scenes of any tension. I understand the intentions here, from riffing on iconic war movies, to muddying the memories of these guys and showing their time in the war as heroic and just, but it just didn't fit the movie tonally at all.The film also loses its message somewhat in the final act of the movie. The comparisons between African Americans and the Vietnamese are stripped out entirely in favour of depicting the Vietnamese as greedy bad guys and bullet sponges for the heroes to mow through. While criticising movies like Rambo early on, it ironically turns into its own Rambo full of gore and bad-taste violence, with little regard for realism. The sheer amount of coincidences in this movie are hard to ignore as well, from the mine sweepers they encountered earlier just so happening to be in the same part of expansive Vietnamese jungle as the main troupe, to a character openly confessing he's never shot a gun before getting a perfect headshot first try. And don't get me started on Tien's illegitimate child being thirty years too young.Da 5 Bloods is a movie that misses as much as it hits, and makes it a hard one for me to settle on a rating for. I absolutely loved/loathed the character of Paul, and found him to be one of the most interesting characters I've seen put to screen, I loved the parallels drawn between black suffrage and the Vietnam war, ensuring that the message hit as hard as it possibly could, while disliking the unsuitable for life imagery thrust upon you without warning. The writing is a little ham-fisted, the plot winds around in convenience at times, and the sheer amount of foreshadowing makes a number of scenes crucially predictable. But it managed to remain a powerful watch that tugged on the heartstrings on a number of occasions, filled with fantastic performances from everyone involved, and some really cool use of cinematography to tell the story. I give Da 5 Bloods a respectable 7/10.RIP Chadwick Boseman. Taken before his time.",Da 5 Bloods
57,PedroPires90,Even better on a 2nd view,10,19 March 2021,"I thought that maybe my excitement led me to make more of this on my 1st view, but after rewatching, I even liked it more. It's a war movie, it's a blood and family movie, it's a drama, it's violent, it's an adventure movie. It's Platoon, it's Indiana Jones, it's Crooklyn, it's Born on the 4th of July.I accept this is not an easy movie, it's pace is not for everybody, it's genre-bending is not for everybody, but definitely worked for me, really touched me and kept me excited for all the 2.5 hours. Now I can say this is my favourite film from Spike Lee.It's a perfect movie? Maybe not, maybe the 2nd act could be slightly better, but all the rest is so good, it has so many great and beautiful moments that I can only give it 5 stars. Beautiful cinematography, great editing (I know politics is a big deal for some, but you are watching a Spike Lee movie, wtf do you expect?), great score and another fantastic job by Spike using those angles and camera movement in an outstanding way.PS: Delroy Lindo is the King. I don't care what the Academy says. This is not only of the best 5 performances of the year. It is, by a large distance, THE performance of the year (sorry Chadwick, you also did a great job in Ma Rainey's, but...). We should also talk more about Clarke Peters and Isiah Whitlock. I'm pretty sure that in 20 years, much more people will remember this movie and rewatch it than the vast majority of the Oscars nominees this year, and that is what it matters.",Da 5 Bloods
58,ethanbresnett,"Despite missing the mark in a few areas, still a very good film worth watching!",8,9 September 2020,"A very intriguing story which went down a few routes I very much wasn't expecting. A different film to what I thought it was going to be, but a very enjoyable one.What I loved the most about Da 5 Bloods was its central story. It was full of adventure, full of excitement and anticipation. As well as this the film had some powerful and emphatic statements regarding black civil rights and treatment in American society, which were well handled and delivered with the level of care and importance that is warranted. It delivered on many different aspects, and is a film that deserves a good bit of digestion afterward. My only real criticism of the main story is that I don't necessarily think the flashbacks to the past were overly well executed, nor were they particularly necessary for the most part. They didn't contribute much to the fleshing out of the characters or my attachment to them, and had negative impacts on the overall pacing and structure of the film. To their credit did introduce Chadwick Boseman into the film as Stormin Norman, so that isn't a bad thing at all. Its a shame as I think they could have had more of an impact on my emotional investment rather than being used almost solely for exposition.Speaking of performances and cast members however, Delroy Lindo was fantastic and was the stand out member of the cast. His character was afforded the most complex and varied arc over the film, and Delroy well and truly got stuck into this. His performance was as powerful as it was haunting, and if I were to watch the film again, its his performance that I'd most be looking forward to re-watching.Da 5 Bloods, as you'd expect from Spike Lee, is a very well put together film. It had some fantastic nods to classic Vietnam War films, some intelligent humour and was set against a beautiful backdrop that was utilised to its fullest extent in the direction. Despite perhaps being a tad long, Da 5 Bloods is technically very good and most definitely worth a watch.",Da 5 Bloods
59,MovieCriticOnline,Really disappointing,1,7 September 2020,"Spike needs to make less films about race. It's not interesting anymore.This is why his films just never break the mold. There are plenty of great black directors and you don't even know they are black because they just make movies about different stories.The editing was terrible, like they hired an amateur. The continuity didn't match. The eye lines didn't match and the writing worse. Totally stereotypical characters. The dialogue just felt too written, which is a sign of bad writing.It was too staged and I had a hard time figuring out the timeline. Lots of superfluous nonsense. Why play music from 1980 if it is supposed to take place today? You confuse the audience. You couldn't tell the difference between the time lines and the no make up age difference didn't help. They didn't age one bit over 50 years.I am still looking for a good Spike film. Do The Right Thing may have been his only decent film.",Da 5 Bloods
60,akcenat,Experimental soulless B-movie that is offering African-American perspective of Vietnam War,6,18 July 2020,"""Da 5 Bloods"" tackles some heavy material, yet it isn't a drag to watch. But, at 154 minutes, film follows the pattern of Netflix movies that could use some editorial pruning. The cast have very good chemistry - their bond feels genuine and it's enjoyable seeing them together. The script is amusingly blunt at first, but as the main characters continue to trade repetitive thematic dialogue, it feels that director is struggling to tie his various contradictory ambitions together. At the end, it's worth a watch, but film feels like a mess that could be much simpler and more coherent than this, while the whole story suggests that ""minding other people's business"" is the American way.Rating: 6",Da 5 Bloods
61,david-meldrum,Contains And Conveys So Much,9,9 August 2021,"A bold film of huge scope and vision that few directors would have the courage to imagine, and even fewer the skill to pull it off. If its central themes are clear - racial justice, Vietnam - there's much else going on here too; fatherhood, redemption, and forgiveness all come to mind. The dead soldier whose remains are part of the dual quest at the film's centre become almost a holy relic - the character himself spoken of with awe and venerated; and lent poignancy by his portrayal and the fact that the actor playing him, Chadwick Boesman, would make no more films. It's also about memory - the way the chracter's flashbacks to wartime change in every visual aspect but the younger versions of themselves remain played by the older actors emphasises that these are unreliable narrators, who have cast themselves in roles defined by cinema's portrayals of the war. That one character should carry such guilt, then, is striking - we use memory to punish ourselves as much as others, Lee seems to be saying. All in all it may feel sprawling and overlong - but that's precisely what gives it the space to contain and covey so much without feeling overburdened.",Da 5 Bloods
62,Mehki_Girl,Actually Better Than the Reviews,7,12 July 2020,"Everyone is complaining about the age of the characters and that they are inaccurate.I saw this as simply an artistic choice (conceit if you will) Spike Lee made. Rather than finding actors and actresses to play the characters at the age they would in reality be, he simply kept them the same age they are today (except the dead comrade, and lover and the daughter).I thought of this as a kind of fever dream that one or all of them are having, where people are the age you remember them and the age you imagine them to be.Once you get past that... Some people are bothered by the coincidences:The soldier knew exactly where to go to see if former lover. Who's to say he didn't make arrangements beforehand? The others knew he was going to see her. She was expecting him. Of course she prepared a meal. Yes, it was surreal. But so was the whole adventure. (The way the son showed up I actually thought he was imaginary.)The son finds the gold, but they had a map and knew the general area. What did you want? To watch them search for it the rest of the movie? The story has to move along.There are a lot of side trips, but it's to give insight into the characters as well as the Vietnamese people and the effects even 50 years later of what we did to them.I found it interesting to see some of Vietnam and see it's people going about their daily business. I hate the arrogance of American films where some foreign country and it's people are nothing more than a backdrop for first world problems or a stupid romance.
Watch the movie as Spike Lee's conceit and he chose a different way to portray characters in their youth and older in a different way than usual. Get over it. Was it that hard to figure out? Have you ever watched foreign films? American films are so pedantic in comparison.Like it or change the channel.",Da 5 Bloods

65,TwistedContent,"Cool, Creative, Compelling, and Conscious in its Execution",8,12 June 2020,"In a time of turmoil and injustice, comes a very welcome freshly rolled Spike Lee joint, and man, it's got all kinds of strains in it. ""Da 5 Bloods"" is a huge canvas colored so richly it's almost hard to take it all in at once, painted by Spike Lee with his stylistic bravura and extraordinary cinematic shifts. It's not a flawless movie, but it is a beautiful one in its own right, a history lesson, a statement, an exploration and an amazing entry in the Vietnam War film canon.We follow Paul, Otis, Eddie and Melvin, four African-American Vietnam war vets, who return to Vietnam in the modern day, seeking the remains of their fallen Squad Leader Stormin' Norman and the box of gold they buried together - return to a new (and same) war as they meet in battle with both man and nature.Spike Lee sparks it up with a short documentarian intro, a substantial history lesson that'll continue throughout the film, about the Vietnam war, the race war in USA, about the social injustices, hurts and consequences in both places of the world. In the first act we get acquainted with the bloods as they land in Vietnam and prepare for the journey - this is where most of comedy is present, giving an impression that the movie, its both playful and raggedy, experienced characters, and issues and history at exploration will be presented in a warmer light. Little did one expect, the tonal shifts, like its story-telling and aesthetical style, is off the charts. And that's something I really loved about this film. During all acts, flashbacks from the actual Vietnam war are frequent, telling the story about da 5 bloods, completed with Stormin' Norman, shot on film, real old-school style. The second act is the most adventurous one, marking the bloods return to the jungle, positively adventurous, until it's not... Not only there are shifts in genre, but also in the morality of the film, which is indeed one of its points. The broad story Lee tells is infused with various cultural legacies, historical points of view, morales and emotions, and under the mass of themes, the focus on the main characters does not flicker one bit. The summary is perhaps a little inconsistent, lacking a tightly weaved plot and sometimes feeling more episodic than not, but it is also compelling, highly ambitious and profound. This guy dropped a tear or two.What needs to be talked about are the performances, the whole cast does a great and admirable job, with the favorites undoubtedly being the five pivotal characters. But if there is a spotlight, I believe it's not up to much debate who it belongs to. I hope there is critical acclaim and awards coming to Delroy Lindo, who plays the movie's most complicated, conflicted and hurting character, and does so devotedly, inspiring awe. Under Spike Lee's direction, the veteran actor delivers an absolute knockout performance, worthy of remembrance. One of my absolute favorites of 2020 so far.The visual side of things here are also every bit as amazing, though I can see how the sum of this can land on somebody's not so great part of critique. Throughout the 190 minutes, ""Da 5 Bloods"" go through at least 4 different aspect ratios, three different cinematography styles and a subtle documentarian touch all throughout. The sauce of all this is, in my humble opinion, chaotic in a good sense, well drawn together regardless of the choice of brush. It is likely that it adds an important dynamic for such a long movie. ""Da 5 Bloods"", when it gets down and dirty, is also explicitly violent and doesn't shy away from appearing realistic in terms of action. I was initially quite concerned about the runtime, but it proved to be well worth it, and the slower parts in fact belong to the first act, which I've always believed is better than to keep the milder, less engaging or intense bits for the second half.""Da 5 Bloods"" is an important, socially and politically conscious and accomplished message, an exercise in telling parts of history that many are blind to - to this day. Additionally, it's a fiery movie that's equal parts entertaining and compelling. Regardless of what Your thoughts on Spike Lee might be, he has creativity and cool ideas stuffed in all of his pockets, a sound mind and heart in the right place. My rating: 8/10.",Da 5 Bloods

Lindo has always worked best under the direction of Spike Lee and this is his career defining performance. Lindo's portrayal of a vet with PTSD soars throughout but in the latter part of the film, his decent into madness fuelled by greed is astounding and unforgettable. Anyone else notice religious allegories in this film? No spoilers. Of course Lee's longtime music collaborator, Terrence Blanchard's score is yet again on point and the choice to use tracks from Marvin Gaye's ""What's Going On"" album is majestically haunting.

69,fciocca,An exhausting movie that conveys a political message incoherently,4,9 November 2020,"I approached this movie without knowing anything about it, so everything was a surprise for me, even the plot. The movie is way too long: there are many scenes and character that could have cut out from the final edit, moreover there are some details that are completely useless and never come back, so why even bother? It takes almost one hour before things start moving.Da 5 Bloods portrays a group of veterans that decide to return in Vietnam after many years to retrieve a precious treasure that they dig. There are many flashbacks, but actors that played these soldiers are the same, so basically they did not age one day. Nothing was done to hide their mature age: no makeup and no digital effects. I guess that they discovered some kind of anti age elisir.Characters were pretty much flat, maybe the only one worth to be mentioned is Otis, but the rest of the cast was pretty much disappointing, therefore I could not care for them. With big names such as Jean Reno and Delroy Lindo, I was expecting better performances for sure. Paul is the most traumatized member between the veterans, and he is very hostile towards the country that once was the enemy. He is never justified for his misbehavior and he is constantly fighting with his friends because of this. Racism can come from everyone and no reason is acceptable. Spike Lee should have gone down this path, maybe the idea is trivial, but Paul's character had so much potential and could have been developed more. Maybe by the end of the movie he could find some compromises and leave behind part of the grudge against Vietnamese people. Instead the director decided to convey a political message about the Black Lives Matter movement that was completely out of context with the plot, together with the unnecessary an overexaggerated violence, that no one asked for. It seems almost that these things were added later on on the script, after protests began in America. There is something off on the last 40 minutes, something does not click. Action sequences are awful and clearly bad coordinated. This movie is like a big soup pot, with many different ingredients that do not match each other, added all at once and then mixed, the result is disgusting.I really like Mr. Lee and I have gladly watched his last year joint "" The BlackKlansman"": the plot was amazing and entertaining, actors delivered wonderful performances and the message was clear and on point.

71,DeBBss,Bad... Just Bad,3,11 July 2020,"Da 5 Bloods is one of those movies where the movie itself doesn't do justice for the trailer. The trailer was stylish, entertaining, and very 60's, but the movie itself has none of those attributes. It's incredibly boring and unnecessarily long due to its slow pacing. I was hopeful that Da 5 Bloods would be a fun Nam' movie that almost everyone loves, but man was it a mess.The plot at first is fun, but then it losses all steam in the second and third acts. There's a lot of walking, complaining, and dialogue. There's no suspense or anything thrilling, and when something does happen, for example, when Eddie gets blown up, it's extremely predictable. The screenplay is just terrible in general, which is ironic because Spike Lee won an Oscar for best adapted screenplay for BlacKkKlansman. Da 5 Bloods is also very political, which isn't a surprise (It is a Spike Lee flick after all), but it just blatantly hates on Donald Trump. And you can hate on Donald Trump all you want, but you have to add it in smartly into the screenplay, not just saying ""Donald Trump is an idiot and a racist"" all the time.None of the characters are likable in my opinion. Their mentality about America is so toxic that it gets to the point where they think they're stealing from America, when in reality they're stealing from their Vietnamese allies. But I'm supposed to see them as the good guys because of they're ""just"" cause. Because of this, I really don't care if the antagonists kill them in the end. The characters are also very one-dimensional, and because of that, most of the characters are going to be forgotten in the next week to come.Really, the best part about Da 5 Bloods was the acting, and if Da 5 Bloods were to some how win an Oscar, it would have to be given to Delroy Lindo for his performance. I was expecting Da 5 Bloods to also be very cinematic, because this is a Nam' film, but it wasn't. But Da 5 Bloods isn't an ugly movie to watch, but it was all quite average in that department.The last thing I want to point out was the music choices, which was beyond strange. The number one rule in a Nam' movie is the music, it's what make these films stand out from the rest. Da 5 Bloods doesn't use any of the classic Nam' hits, but a lot of Marvin Gaye. Marvin Gaye has a lot of great hits, but it doesn't fit the theme of the film.I really wanted to like Da 5 Bloods, but the terrible screenplay, unlikable characters, and obvious political agenda ruined it. And Da 5 Bloods being in a genre that is filled with legendary movies, it makes Da 5 Bloods look like hot garbage. Da 5 Bloods isn't a terrible movie though, and I can see why one would like it, but I'm not going to give it a perfect score just because of diversity and its political agenda.",Da 5 Bloods

Director: Spike Lee
Starring: Delroy Lindo, Jonathan Majors, Clarke Peters, Norm Lewis, Isiah Whitlock jr, Melanie Thierry, Chadwick Boseman etc.Overall rating 100/100Da 5 bloods is about four black Vietnam war veterans, who return to Vietnam many years later, in order to find the remains of their deceased squad leader and to the millions of dollars of gold that has been hidden for many years. Wow what a masterfully crafter movie, with such powerful moments let's start hyping up this movie.First of all, I loved the cultural references and the powerful and emotional beginning. I loved all the different movie references that were scattered throughout the movie. Whether it was Rambo or Apocalypse now I loved the nods to many classics that were linked to this particular films set of characters. I also loved how powerful and emotional the opening was, I loved Spike lee's direction here, having real life footage and flashbacks, of the history of racism and the horrifying things black people as a race have had to go through really hit me hard especially with the Black lives matter movement, so this resignated well with today's issues.My next two positives would be the chemistry between the characters and the humour. I thought the chemistry between all the actors here was perfect, you instantly believed their friendships as soon as they were on screen, they were all infectious to watch, and their friendships were believable and felt natural considering what they had been through together, and the humour between all the characters was also great, the dark humour, and the brutal honesty between everyone was infectious to watch and just made the characters even more likeable.My next two positives would be the clever links between past and present and the fantastic action with a tense tone. The movie cut between past and present with the main characters, they spent a perfect amount of time between tenses, it really made you understand the characters more and what they have been through, and whenever there was a loophole in the present between the characters or within the plot, it was explained in detail in the flashbacks to the Vietnam war. The action was also excellent, the movie also had excellent action sequences, showing the nightmare that the soldiers had to go through not knowing when they were going to be ambushed, the gore despite being hard to look at was also well executed and added to the impact of the scenes. The movie also executed a very tense tone, the film had you on the edge of your seat throughout a lot of it's action scenes or sudden plot twists, when the main characters were trapped in a mine field it was incredibly tense not knowing when something would go off, showing that I cared for the characters due to Spike Lee's masterful character work.My next few positives would be the surprising plot twists and added depth, the performances and character development. The film had excellent plot twists, that I did not see coming at all which really surprised and made me enjoy the movie even more, the fact that Paul (Delroy Lindo) had such severe PTSD because of the guilt of killing the squad leader in Vietnam played by Chadwick Boseman was an incredible twist that I didn't see coming, it made you understand why he was acting the way he was and added so much more depth to the film, there was also so many surprise deaths that I didn't see coming. The performances from everybody was also fantastic. Delroy Lindo was absolutely fantastic, his acting was so realistic that his slow mental breakdown was incredibly uncomfortable to watch which proves his performance left an impact, all the main characters were great as well, Chadwick boseman also played his role perfectly and his performance was powerful, proving he can have an acting career outside marvel. The character development was fantastic, the character work was just excellent. There was an equal amount of depth and development to all of the main characters which is very rare in films. You understood all the characters and what they were going through, so the film masterfully developed all the performances and characters to make you deeply care for everyone involved.My next two positives would be the cinematography and the deep and powerful themes and messages. I thought the films cinematography was excellent. Some of the shots during the flashbacks to the Vietnam war were stunning, with excellent use of colour to make the scenes pop out on screen and this same craft was used throughout. The films themes and messages was extremely powerful as well, the subject matter of racism was tackled very well, and Spike was not afraid to speak his opinions on the subject and the leader of America which I respected. The movie was really educational especially for what's still happening in todays society, so this was very important for the black lives matter movement, but the movie was also about brotherhood, which became more and more the central theme alongside racism which I loved, as you cared for all the characters to much after what they went through together, I really connected and loved the brotherhood that they all had throughout even in death where they died protecting their country and to save each other.My final two positives would be the films incredible script and powerful and moving ending. Wow the films script will stick with me for a long time, the powerful lines tackling issues with racism in the past and to this day, all the characters with their fantastic performances delivered them perfectly, and the script was moving and powerful. The ending was extremely powerful, as they changed the main theme to brotherhood, it was extremely emotional and heart-warming that everyone was honoured for their service and sacrifices. And the fact that the only surviving character Otis (Clarke Peters) gave his sum of the money to his daughter that he never knew he had, and the rest was used to support the black lives matter movement which was very powerful, and despite this being filmed before the sickening events recently it's almost like Spike Lee knew that this movement would come to light so hats off to Spike for making a powerful piece of art.Overall, Da 5 bloods is a close to perfect that you are going to get with a movie. Masterfully written script and character work. Fantastic performances, as well as being educational and empowering the message of what the black lives matter movement is all about.",Da 5 Bloods
73,ragingbull_2005,Oscar for Delroy Lindo,7,23 June 2020,"Over the last 30+ years, Spike Lee has, invariably with a few exceptions, made films about Black identify in the US. These have been searing commentaries about the ways that that country has failed it's African American citizens. This time, he goes back and forth, between the present day and the 60s & the Vietnam War and gives us a POV of four Black veterans of that war, who return to 'Nam to take care of some unfinished business.I really loved the screenplay, with its frequent allusions to popular as well as little known Blacks of historical import.Delroy Lindo deserves an Oscar nomination and probably the statuete for his portrayal of Trump supporting, anti Asian, maniacal fighting machine. His intensity is frightening and he has the best written role. He lights up the screen and dares you to take your eyes away from him. Didn't know he had so much brilliance hidden inside. The rest of the cast is also spot on.This is Spike Lee's most ambitious effort since the superb _Inside Man_ back in 2006 and it is great to see Netflix backing him.Recommended.",Da 5 Bloods
74,MogwaiMovieReviews,Another Joyless Spike Lee Joint,2,12 June 2020,"First of all, let's take this time to remember once again that Spike Lee is NOT a good filmmaker. He's never BEEN a good filmmaker. The otherwise inexplicably boundless patience and goodwill the media and the industry have repeatedly shown his film student-level back catalogue can only be explained through a desire to be complimentary towards him simply because of his skin colour and political affiliations. Which is pretty demeaningly racist in itself, when you think about it. It would be lovely to have some great black filmmakers in the world but Spike Lee is not the guy.Lee is incapable of making compelling stories with believable, engaging characters in them, and everything wrong with his other films are just as wrong with this: 'Da 5 Bloods' is preachy, overlong, racially antagonistic, staggeringly self-indulgent and clumsily unbelievable in every way at every turn. Anytime any topic that could be considered even slightly political pops its head up, the scene stops and Lee starts sermonizing. The arrogance of Spike Lee shaming black people into voting (and thinking) how he wants does not seem that far off to me from Joe Biden telling them - as he did - ""if you don't vote for me, you ain't black!""But okay, okay, enough about that...The opening scenes, summing up the mood of the Vietnam War years, are powerful, if manipulative, and the use of Marvin Gaye's peerless ""Inner City Blues"" is well-used and welcome. But then the actual story begins and if it wasn't a black cast, we would all be talking about it as if it were a Chuck Norris/Steven Seagal straight-to-video turkey. The actual Vietnam flashbacks look like they came from an episode of The A-Team (with the same music).Every non-black character is a prop, there to just perform a single function and then leave, with no insight into their inner thoughts, feelings, or desires. But the lead cast aren't any better: one of the guys is a Trump supporter, so he does all the bad stuff; the rest are largely interchangeable and instantly forgettable. Nothing memorable is said by anyone, and the script is seventh-rate throughout. The one good line in the whole damn movie is Jean Reno saying ""I thank you for this ignorant American one-sided version of World War Two"".Even the scene where they find the gold is a catastrophe: I don't want to give away any spoilers, but if you stop to think about the breathtaking unlikelihood of how it is hit upon, in the middle of hundreds of miles of jungle, it should tell you a lot about the laziness of writing and worldbuilding on display in the rest of this disaster.Lee has this amazing cast of black actors, who've all proven themselves unforgettable in other roles (with white filmmakers), and instead of allowing them to shine with complexity, nuance, wit and humour, he forces them to perform these dumbed-down stereotypes, fit for an 80s made-for-TV soap opera. Everything is so crass, unsubtle, haphazard and over-the-top.This film could have been amazing: a profound, insightful, surprising and spellbinding take on adventure movies with a similar theme, like Three Kings or The Man Who Would Be King or Treasure of the Sierra Madre, from an all-black perspective. But to even mention those masterpieces in the same sentence as this is an insult. It's as dumb as a bag of rocks. Please stop giving this man money to make bad B-movies.",Da 5 Bloods
75,Mcduff3601,I wanted to like this movie but... the bad reviews are all correct,1,30 June 2020,"This was just terrible. If it wasn't for the gore this would be a made for TV movie from the 90's. Most of the acting was really bad, the dialogue felt unscripted but not in a good way. The story was mediocre at best and the way the characters abandon their convictions over what seems like no reasons it made it seem like it wasn't done on purpose but just from lack of any kind of good writing.I was expecting to see more around what it was like to be a black soldier in Vietnam but there was so little service paid to this topic it was literally a few guys standing around going ""Oh man it sucks to be a black soldier in Vietnam... which is where we are right now... in Vietnam... because they are just using us black soldiers. Hey man did I mention to you I am a black soldier in vietnam?"" This is such a HUGE topic that deserves a much better media outlet than this piece of trash.Ken Burns does an amazing job of covering the war in his documentary The Vietnam War it is a bit of an investment though at about 20hrs to watch. BUT it goes into the details of it all (if you want to watch about the war). There are so many better movies depicting the struggles of Black Americans, like Malcom X, Detroit, Glory just to name a few. Don't bother with this movie it has NO redeeming qualities.",Da 5 Bloods
76,Brooklynsmagicmike,I wanted to like this movie so bad but I couldn't.,2,17 June 2020,"The only reason I even gave two stars is for the actors and the acting which I found to be perfectly fine. Everything else I diddn't like though. The movie was overly long and very draggy. Hardly any action, bereft of emotion, and the humor fell flat alot. I also diddn't like that flashbacks were done in widescreen and old vintage film vibe. I felt like it took away from the story and was done to much at random times.I personally think this film could of been great if Spike Lee just took it in a little bit of different direction. But I personally felt like he was hungup to much on the politics of the film and undertones its what made the movie lack in everything else.",Da 5 Bloods

79,coconutkungfu-30704,Another Great Spike Lee Film,8,25 June 2020,"Though it isn't as good as Lee's masterpiece Malcolm X, Da 5 Bloods is still an expertly directed film with engaging characters. The film has a 2 hour and 30 minute runtime but it never drags and is excellently paced and nicely edited. The acting is absolutely great, especially Delroy Lindo's performance. As a viewer I really felt that the four main leads had a genuine connection and ended up caring about all of them. The film effectively alternates between time and place (and aspect ratio) and the use of Marvin Gaye songs is very fitting. There are a few moments that feel a bit too serendipitous and not all characters are given the same depth and care as the leads, but Da 5 Bloods is still highly recommended! Give it a watch on Netflix.",Da 5 Bloods
80,efd-10467,Okay but a bit mixed up,7,19 June 2020,"Spike Lee couldn't seem to make his mind up on what sort of movie this was, a war buddy film, at times an action thriller, a treasure hunt, a road movie, with really obvious political messages interspersed throughout.At times the flashback characters didn't look any younger and a closing still of the 5 American veterans in their youth looked terrible, as if they'd been airbrushed by a high school art class.It jumps from a commentary on black soldiers not getting recognition in the 60's to modern black lives matter snapshots. I think Spike Lee had too much to say, it was at times a bit jumbled.Vietnam looks spectacular, the treasure hunt plot is a great idea, the violence was a bit over done making it seem at times like a Rambo movie.So interesting but confused, probably falls a bit short of being good, he should have streamlined his overall plot and perhaps made 2 movies out of his messages.",Da 5 Bloods

82,pranayjalvi,An urgent and important film on racism and War Veterans.,7,12 June 2020,"Da 5 Bloods is an urgent film on racism that's always been a major problem. The fight for America yet there wasn't no equality even after the justice.The performances from Delroy Lindo and Clark Peters were outstanding along with the cinematography. The film stretches a bit in its runtime of 2hr 35 mins, but did succeeds in showing the ugly reality behind the beautiful display.A simultaneous play between the war moments and the current situation of the veterans, Spike Lee does a great work in transitioning the emotions.
My Rating : 3.5/5",Da 5 Bloods
83,johnsmithjanuary-20081,disjointed and disappointing,2,19 September 2021,Maybe this should have been a documentary or drama series. Acting and dialogue is unbearably cartoonish and overdone/overacted. The movie itself was choppy and spliced with Vietnam war photos and imagery that randomly pop up.,Da 5 Bloods
84,TheCorniestLemur,Being back in 'Nam,7,27 August 2020,"Spike Lee is a director that's been up and down in my eyes, on one hand, Do The Right Thing, on the other hand, Oldboy. Even when he hasn't made something that is such obvious garbage as Oldboy, I always feel slightly intimidated trying to criticize his films as a white person, because obviously there are themes in the majority of them that I will simply never fully understand, especially in the time this particular one came out.
So maybe I just don't know what I'm talking about when I say that for the majority of this one, the whole racism thing kind of flew over my head. It feels more like a look at the long-lasting impacts of war, with the countless active mines still lying around (dear god that jumpscare), the PTSD all these guys have been left with, etc.
It's a pretty well directed film, not quite as good as Do The RIght Thing in my opinion, but there's still many shots that have stuck in my mind for various reasons, some horrific, some poignant, and the performances are brilliant throughout, especially Delroy Lindo. Even if this year wasn't as dry on new releases, I'd be calling out for an Oscar nomination for him.
However, graphic content warning, much like BlacKkKlansman, there is some real footage of some horrific stuff in this film. Some of it feels unnecessary, and all of it should probably come with a warning.
I also feel like two of the titular Bloods should have definitely been fleshed out more, as there isn't really much to them, to the extent that I honestly struggle to even remember their names.
And there's also a LOT of ""oh, come on"" moments with unbelievable coincidences, but other than that, it's probably my favourite film of the year so far.
Even if that sounds like a bit of a hollow statement, it's still worth a look.",Da 5 Bloods
85,TheVictoriousV,A Spike Lee Joint - for all that that's worth,7,13 July 2020,"Spike Lee's Da 5 Bloods is one of the movies that got away (thanks again to streaming). But as hungry as I was for something new to watch in the COVID-induced media drought, Lee's 2013 remake of Park Chan-wook's Oldboy - as well as his behavior during the marketing stages of said remake, documented in the YMS review - made me a bit uncertain. He's not the worst person in the world to humor with box office scrilla (Lord knows I can separate the art from the artist when it comes to someone as awful as Roman Polanski), but there's something especially infuriating in being, well, a general prick.But yes, separating the art from the artist is useful and Lee the filmmaker is no doubt skillful. However, what might make him irritating here is the un-subtlety with which he allegorizes modern politics (sometimes in ways that conflate the past and present in reductive ways, as popularized by a few recent protests you may have heard of, mainly on the trustworthy and honest news source that is Instagram).Released on Netflix, Da 5 Bloods dropped at an especially opportune time, but Spike Lee's topical (and extra profitable) hatred of the current US administration isn't the only thing this film has going for it. Much of it plays stylistically like an Apocalypse Now love letter, partly taking place during the Vietnam War and focusing on African-American veterans who go back to finish something they recall starting long ago; the shifts in eras are signposted by endearing differences in picture quality and aspect ratio, with some parts looking authentically ""Sixties"".da funf.jpgLed by Delroy Lindo, the all-black cast is pretty fantastic - Chadwick Boseman is better here than in Black Panther and it is a wondrous sight to once again see such The Wire regulars as Clarke Peters and Isiah Witlock Jr. Its B-movie influences are also pretty fun, albeit not in a way that ruins the more seriously-minded social criticism.Even when the film is a little obvious (see above) it admittedly isn't ashamed; its causticness remains consistent through the comedy as well as the truly eye-popping and uncomfortable bits (alas, the segues between comedy and drama aren't always the most seamless). As I implied, Lee is friendly to the camp that believes all black people have necessarily had the same experiences through almost all eras in all Western and Nordic countries, but his observations when it comes to forms of racism that inexplicably still linger, most notably within law enforcement, are upsettingly accurate - let's not worry about whether the rest of Lee's commentary is equivalent to mooning Trump and running off (recall the cartoony patriarch Donald Strutt, or whatever the heck is name was, from the otherwise thoughtful Beatriz at Dinner).In the end, I'd say I land at a 3.5 out of 5 for this particular Netflix original. Am I being fair? To be honest with y'all, I find it difficult to assess media in general after the final season of Netflix's sci-fi thriller Dark, released at the end of last month, set a whole new standard for audio-visual storytelling; as I see it, conceptual ambition on that level (both in terms of convoluted plotting and existentialist weight) has never been quite so meticulous or internally consistent in execution. I feel I just don't look at media quite the same way as I used to. Da 5 Bloods is a fine film but it is absolutely not the best thing you'll find on Netflix at the moment.Will I mention it on my end-of-the-year retrospective? Honestly, it depends on how many more movies will actually get completed and released this year. I do have some ""arguably from 2019"" films that I can cite (Waves and Little Women being the best), due to their delayed theatrical releases near me, but boy am I longing for things to go back to normal. After all, if it weren't for the lockdown crap, shouldn't the Aladdin remake be getting a remake soon?A word on my recent absence (provided you read this on my blog and not on, say, IMDb): I've been beating around the bush too long in my private life and have been rather busy making some actually tangible steps towards, for lack of a better term, something new (not made more accessible by a regrettable period of procrastination in my student life and various despairing strikes to my family). I also traveled the Stockholm Archipelago to ease my mind, which did wonders outside of feeling a bit distant the first night at the cabin. Despair is but one reason I haven't reviewed anything since June. The other concerns the effects of a certain virus that halted the film industry, both in terms of distribution and production.",Da 5 Bloods
86,brefane,What Da F...is going on!?,1,17 June 2020,"Middle class, armchair revolutionary Spike Lee has made a didactic, bombastic and ultimately frustrating film that like Summer of Sam, Bamboozled and Chi-Raq feels out of control. Do the Right Thing has a strong directorial vision, She's Gotta Have It is an enjoyable and accomplished low budget film and after a cliched start, Malcolm X is compelling but, many of his subsequent films suggest that he's a one-trick pony and his talent falls short of his ambition.

Da 5 Bloods cannot decide what it wants to be: it starts as a Vietnam war homage with a deeper meaning, then morphs into a buddy reunion comedy with zero soul, before ending as a poorly-conceived action film.Considering the scope Vietnam gives you for cinematics, nothing is explored or experimented - I honestly think any amateur with a DSLR could have done what Lee manages with the landscape - and this is a massive waste of an opportunity.The acting is nothing special either; Delroy Lindo is working his hardest to carry the film (a lot of strange monologues are involved), but the supporting cast is wooden, and Jean Reno's cameo is so lazily written. Chadwick Boseman's cameo is nothing special, but unduely has done the film's reputation well, given his tragic passing.The drama is not dramatic, the flashbacks unconvincing, and the end product a far cry from what Spike Lee fans have come to expect.My advice?

89,topitimo-829-270459,"Good, though not a Top 5 entry for Mr. Lee.",8,15 June 2020,"""Da 5 Bloods"" sees Spike Lee continuing the late-career success that he began with ""The Black Klansman"" (2018). Like the previous film, this film comments upon American racism ""then and now"". Though this is Vietnam film, it is set mostly in present-day, with few flashbacks to the actual fighting. 33% of the American soldiers who fought in Vietnam were African-American, but they have been largely ignored by history. The film states this quite frankly with the black characters discussing the narrative of ""Rambo 2"" (1985). Lee's film honors the black soldiers, but also attacks the system they were sent to fight for. It is a fascinating picture that dodges simplified readings.The film tells the story of four black Vietnam vets (Delroy Lindo, Clarke Peters, Norm Lewis & Isiah Whitlock Jr.), who re-unite in Vietnam in present day. They have all been traumatized by the war to a different degree, especially by the experience of losing their commander (Chadwick Boseman) who served as a role model for them. The guys have been sent to locate his body, but they also have another motive for returning. I will not enclose more details about the plot, since there are all sorts of twists and turns here.Spike Lee was inspired by both ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979) and ""The Treasure of Sierra Madre"" (1948) when making this film. The influence of both is very detectable, sometimes painfully so. I like Lee very much, but often it seems he is a director who needs someone to occasionally tell him ""no"". This film is like so many of his, partly great, but pushed down by sloppiness and bad choices. For instance, Lee makes several direct references to before-mentioned films, like playing ""Ride of the Valkyries"" without any point. I would like to enjoy the film as it is, but sometimes the signature style of the director just inserts these bumps to the road.I think this film really shines in the depictions of the four leads and the African-American experience. One of the four is a Trump supporter, and Lee has plenty to say about that as well. I like the way this film, as well as ""Black Klansman"" tied themselves to present-day affairs, which made them feel more necessary. Here is a thing Lee's style is very good for, as he can stop the film and show you a documentary clip to keep you informed what the characters are talking about. Yet this film is also a tad overlong, and in the latter half strays in different narrative/thematic directions, which made the whole seem less focused. Also, this film starts off as an ambitious piece of cinema, but towards the ending tries to become a more entertaining action film almost. I didn't really care for this turn of events, but mostly this was a nice watch.While this is nowhere near as good as ""Apocalypse Now"" or ""Sierra Madre"", or ""Do the Right Thing"" or ""Malcolm X"" for that matter, I would recommend this to cinephiles. It is a film that will spark a hundred interesting conversations.",Da 5 Bloods

91,BillBayard,It does eventually end. I promise.,2,22 February 2021,"I've long had mixed feeling about Spike Lee as a director. However, I thought his last film, BlacKkKlansman, was one of the best films of its year and vastly superior to the antiquated and phony Green Book which somehow won an Oscar for best picture. I was anxious to see this. The pluses: Chadwick Boseman's all too brief performance, who is fine, but its primary interest was due to his role being about death in some fashion or another and how brave he was for taking on this small role knowing what we now know. Some of the cinematography was good. It makes fun of Trump. And finally, it ends, though it takes a very long time for that to occur. This movie is pretty much awful. The direction is a mess. The performances by the four principles are either overacted or cartoonish. The plot is a little far fetched, but could have held some interest if it were done with some believability and didn't get worse as it went along and it has some gruesome scenes. It has a very strong and major reality issue involving those same four principles who we see over a 50 year or more period of time and apparently we are not supposed to notice the lack of age difference, though sometimes they do keep their faces hidden as much as they can. I could go on and on about the things that are wrong about it such as the cornball ending, but I shall digress after I add I am clueless as to the acclaim and the awards it has won and those that it is up for.

93,js-66130,BLOODY MESS,5,23 June 2020,"A sprawling, Vietnam Vet, gold hunt, family reconciliation, Black Lives Matter opus from Spike Lee? Careful what you wish for.Never know with a Spike Lee Joint, and achingly, in spite of a series of great intentions, and moments of brilliance, ""Da 5 Bloods"" drags, confuses, and eventually crumbles. It has a rushed feeling, as if Spike wanted to strike quickly to make a film for the moment, and who can blame him? Perhaps he'll revisit, edit and tidy this Disjoint into the coherent classic that lurks beneath.There are moments though.Delroy Lindo in an anguished role of a misguided, bullying, suffering Vet, is absolutely superb in a hallucinatory, Shakespearean monologue as he crashes through the jungle. Spike GoPro's his head for a distorted, uncomfortably close selfie experience usually reserved for skateboarding YouTube clips. It is sensational.Chadwick Boseman, as a fallen brother and de facto group leader, appears in flashbacks as a young, virile black Jesus figure, commanding the screen as much as his comrades in arms.Lee's alternating use of aspect ratios to time travel is a clever move that allows the film to flow seamlessly, bringing his audience into and out of the moment in proper rhythm. Sadly, it is a bit lost on the tiny Netflix screens this is streamed on. ""Da 5 Bloods"" screams to belong on a gargantuan theatre screen.Besides a sloppy and convoluted plot line concerning some loot looting, the greatest misstep is using aging actors in both present and flashback sequences. It just looks er, goofy. Unfortunately secondary acting is also weak, even from the usually fine Jean Reno. A father and daughter sideline is not just awkward, but again, impossible to digest because of a faulty time line. And on it goes. Is this an important movie? Maybe, it sure has a lot to say, but Spike has handled this much better in the past.At a watch-checking two and a half hours, this would work oh so well as a lean ninety minute adventure. A director's cut in reverse if you will.hipCRANK",Da 5 Bloods

99,PotassiumMan,"Spike Lee joint on Vietnam, incendiary and cathartic",8,14 June 2020,"Even if Spike Lee's unapologetically political style of filmmaking is not your cup of tea, his new film about four Vietnam veterans returning to their old battleground in search of gold that they came across on the tour of duty might be worth viewing. They are also intent on recovering the remains of their fierce commanding officer who motivated and inspired them. The story is spiked with powerful performances all around (led by an explosive Delroy Lindo) and laced with viscerally taut action sequences and a sterling soundtrack.The timeliness of the film's message couldn't be better. The rage over how black America bore a disproportionate human cost in fighting the war in Vietnam, while at the same time African-Americans struggled to reach anything approaching societal and legal equality back home is balanced by a pained but ironclad belief in the undying honor of military service and loyalty to one's country. The film also has a ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" feel when it tackles themes of friendship, family and hunting for gold.Although not always smooth, with an occasional narrative drift and a late undisciplined lapse into preachiness, the film has an awful lot to say about the overlap between United States foreign policy missteps and social injustice at home. Not all the main characters are given a solid introduction and backstory, but their group dynamic becomes quite clear. The actual war experience for these men is never conveyed in-depth, except in occasional flashbacks. Despite these flaws, this film has many suspenseful, poignant and hard-hitting moments. You will barely notice the running time. It's a punch in the gut, as it touches on several unpleasant truths about American history and goes down as one of Spike Lee's more challenging films.

Spike Lee made a war film... sort of. Netflix continues to impress as the studio keeps getting A level talent in front of and behind the camera to keep its original content churning out. Director Spike Lee returns after his very well thought of Oscar contender 'BlacKkKlansman'. This film deals with 4 African Americans who were engaged in the war in Vietnam, and all these years later they return to not only find the remains of a long fallen comrade, but also lost gold which immediately made me think of the film 'Three Kings'. This is very different from that film though. Lee assembles a good array of black actors to play his ""bloods"" including Delroy Lindo, Clarke Peters and Isiah Whitlock, Jr.. Chadwick Boseman also appears as their long, lost fallen comrade known as Stormin' Norman. While the simple setup has the makings of a quality film this project felt very all over the place. It lacked focus and was oddly disjointed in its action and storytelling. There were times it didn't feel like a production at the level of a director such as Spike Lee who has made some of America's most pivotal films.
The story starts with four aging Vietnam vets who meet each other in Vietnam returning to that country for the first time since that war so long ago. It is a joyous reunion, and something they obviously had been planning for quite a while. Long ago in the midst of the Vietnam war these four created a special bond under the leadership of Norm, the Boseman character. They were a special unit and were tasked with securing a downed CIA plane with gold destined for the Vietnamese. During this operation Norman was killed and left behind and the gold was buried. All these years later those soldiers who were dubbed 'Da Bloods' have returned for Norman and the gold. The situation starts to turn as Lindo's character's, Paul's, son tracks them down and tags along. Combine that with running into some sort of do-gooders who are land mine activists as well as a smuggler played by Jean Reno who is looking to double cross them. In addition Paul's mental state rapidly decays. All that adds into a melting pot of a messed up situation. It becomes a chaotic free for all with the gold at the end of the rainbow for whoever survives.
I kept struggling with what kind of movie I was watching. Is it a war film? Is it a message movie? Is it a heist film of sorts? It is trying to be all these things combined with various family melodrama aspects, with just random things tossed in. The addition of the land mine activists is bizarre and is only there to serve the plot. Part of the film feels like a direct ripoff of 'Treasure of the Sierra Madre'. You mainly see it in Lindo's mental breakdown combined with a scene that has the famous ""We don't need no stinkin' badges"" line. Lee also used an interesting directorial tactic when dealing with the scenes of the Bloods in the past. Instead of having young actors playing the main characters in Vietnam or de-aging them he just inserted the older actors into those scenes. I am not sure how effective it is, but I imagine it has to be a money saver. Lindo gets the juiciest role having the most angst to dig into plus the angle with his kid combined with his steady mental degeneration over the course of the trip. Everyone else does a good to serviceable job with the best performance probably being delivered by Jonathan Majors who plays Lindo's son. This film had some decent elements but ultimately was too scatterbrained and bizarrely unfocused to capture my attention. At times the plot made little to no sense at all. I would have expected much better from a film maker the caliber of Lee.

105,hypestyle,"""Da 5 Bloods"" is Spike Lee's Magnum Opus",10,21 June 2020,"""Da 5 Bloods"" is an action drama highlighting a fateful reunion with a quartet of Vietnam War veterans in modern-day Vietnam. The cast is led by Delroy Lindo, Chadwick Boseman, Jonathan Majors, Isiah Whitlock, Clarke Peters and Norm Lewis.This film explores the broken promises for Black American soldiers after their war experiences. ""Miracle at St. Anna"" was one of Lee's first to tackle a story that mostly takes place well outside the United States. Given his initial pedigree as a ""New York City Stories"" auteur, this is an obvious change of pace, but it is well worth more than one viewing.Four of the veterans reunite in Ho Chi Minh City to attempt to find the remains of fallen soldier/field leader ""Stormin Norman"" (Boseman). What neither the US or Vietnam State Departments know is that the four men also plan to find a hidden trunk full of gold that was lost in a CIA plane crash in the Vietnamese Jungle back during their original tour of duty.All four surviving men have been scarred by the war to varying degrees. The most deeply disturbed is Paul (Lindo), who in the latest manifestation of his bitterness and discontent has become an unabashed supporter of President Donald Trump: this makes him the object of caustic ribbing by his buddies, but Paul is resolute: He feels absolutely cheated of his due respect and reward for his bodily and mental sacrifice: both as a soldier and as a black citizen enduring Civil Rights-era turmoil and social tumult.To varying degrees, all of Paul's friends agree: Eddie, Melvin and Otis. Paul's adult son David is a surprise, and initially unwelcome tag-along: he wants to finally find a way to bond with his long-estranged father, but Paul isn't about to make it easy.The explorations of these men provide an intriguing alternative point of view for 2020 audiences: Vietnam-based dramas have been produced for decades, but scarcely few have done a deep dive into the point of view of what Black soldiers went through, much less how they fared in the years after the war.The cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel is top-notch. Lee's direction is assured; the visual atmosphere is alternately cool, warm or hot and intense in other parts. There are four credited writers, including original writers Paul De Meo and Danny Bilson.Some of the scenes linger longer than they should. Some of the tribute/easter-egg dialogue will be obvious to people who are familiar with certain war films or heist films. Delroy Lindo should get major acting award nominations for his performance. His Paul is a firestorm of macho belligerence and deep emotional woundedness all wound-up in a man who feels abandoned and guilty. Clark Peters should get supporting actor nominations. Maybe the conceit of using the same actors to play their younger selves is off-putting for some, but this viewer managed to get over it.Given the already 2-hour-plus running time of the film, I don't know that there was time to go deeper into the philosophy of how people of color can be used as tools of white-driven colonialism and hyper-capitalism against other people of color and indigenous communities, the influence of Black-derived pop culture in Asian countries (Motown played at nightclubs, or even modern K-Pop music) or the contemporary contexts of Black-Asian relations in the United States. Paul's confrontation with a fellow trying to sell him a chicken updates the spat between Bill Nunn's Radio Raheem and the Korean-born shopkeepers in ""Do the Right Thing"". Paul's occasional rants about ""illegals"" and the rest of the crew's attempts to calm him down is about as far as it goes.Whatever the technical faults of a director like Spike Lee, he has earned his right for due consideration in taking on a conceptually risky project. ""Da 5 Bloods"" delivers the gold, but at a cost.",Da 5 Bloods

Delroy Lindo, Clarke Peters, and Chadwick Boseman deserve major Oscar attention next year and every else does a pretty good job. The screenplay and story are all great. I appreciated the themes that Spike Lee presented and some of those themes made some scenes quite emotional. The twist towards the end of the film feels earned and makes sense and I liked how Spike Lee changed the aspect ratio for the flashbacks. I also enjoyed how they had the older versions of the characters in the flashbacks. The only issues I had with the film were pacing and special effects. The pacing feels off here and there and there are points where I feel that the film does drag. Some of the visual gunshots and blood looked pretty bad and were quite distracting at points. I also took issue with how some of the action was shot. It's hard to tell what is going on because Spike Lee isn't the greatest action director but that isn't the point of the story so it wasn't too distracting for me.

110,nikitalinivenko,Black Rambo,6,14 June 2020,"This movie was announced shortly after Blakkklansman came out, and I've been waiting a year-and-a-half for it; so after such a long wait, I suppose it's only to be expected that I would be somewhat let down. This is Spike's second war movie, after Miracle at St. Anna (2008) (which amid all the slog, inaccuracy, pacing issues and flaws did have good scenes), and I hoped Spike would've learned from all the criticisms of that movie and presented a more polished war picture, but no such luck. Same trappings, 'present day' framing device intercut with flashbacks, melodramatic presentation present in half his movies, beating you over the head with the same exact Spike Lee-isms (we get it, Spike, you've been making the same point over and over the last 35 years), and, as usual, Zero attempts at subtlety (the in-your-face abrasive attitude worked for Do the Right Thing and Blackkklansman, but falls flat everywhere else). Seriously, it wouldn't kill him to show some restraint. The movie is over-long as well, clocking in at an unnecessary two-and-a-half hours, when two or so would've sufficed - the set-up alone takes an hour, with some unnecessary scenes and plots crow-bar'd in there.
The few action sequences there are are pretty typical Hollywood shootouts you've seen in countless action videos, and essentially the movie tries to present itself as an anti-Rambo, while at times coming close to sorta boiling down to a black version of Rambo. The plot centers around four vets who go back to Vietnam in present day to dig up a dead friend killed in combat, and more importantly, find a cache of buried gold a la Treasure of the Sierra Madre (they find the body, but then kinda just leave it there?). The references abound, most noticeably Apocalypse Now, which he fully embraces, and Delroy Lindo's death towards the end reminds me of the ending of The Thin Red Line, though that may have been unintentional; also, that was a jarring moment that threw me off - Delroy wanders thru the jungle, comes to terms with his friends' death, then abruptly cuts to him digging his grave at Vietnamese gunpoint. I was hoping for more of an 'epic', especially given the running time, but instead it's essentially a repackaging of Miracle at St. Anna, with the same themes and all (also, a Vietcong chick on the radio telling them they're country doesn't give a damn about them, exactly like the radio Nazi chick towards the beginning of St. Anna), and it ends with a shootout in a single location while they're pinned down and injured, exactly like St. Anna. I didn't hate St. Anna, but I was hoping for a different war movie this time around. What we get is Spike stuck in his ways.",Da 5 Bloods

If this film did not have the cast it has, I would never have tuned in. Lee, being the limited director that he is, cannot pull off the firefight scenes, but the many homage's to other Viet Nam films ('Apocalypse Now' 'Rambo' 'Missing In Action' 'Uncommon Valor' 'The Deer Hunter' and even 'The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre') are well done.Which brings me to that cast. I have always enjoyed Delroy Lindo. He elevates even bad films.Clarke Peters and Isiah Whitlock, Jr. Are my two favorites from 'The Wire' (in fact the title of my review for the wire is ""SHEEEEEEEEEEEIT""), also referenced in this film. Whitlock is also outstanding in Bryan Cranston's limited Showtime series 'Your Honor', also reviewed by me.The character of Lindo's son, David (Jonathan Majors), I presume is meant for comedy relief and to lower the demographic, and to take an important crap, but is annoying in the extreme.Of course, it's always good to see the late Chadwick Bozeman, as it is Jean Reno.Norm Lewis (Eddie) made no impression whatsoever.Of course, we have to work through the racist BLM/CRT screenplay to get to the enjoyment of the terrific performances, as well as, the superfluous French and Scandinavian characters.The script is a lot of BLM hooey, with the very interesting twist one of the characters being a MAGA Trump supporter. Unexplained, and a huge buy-in, is why these characters have taken so long to get around to getting back to Nam and finding the gold, as well as, it appears that they have not seen each other in decades, which given their shared secret and brotherly bond, is highly unlikely. There is also no way they could have carried all of those gold bricks weighing-in at 27.4 pounds each. The whole sub-plot with the land-mine hunters was ludicrous in the extreme.

And I'd place the blame (and the credit) on director Spike Lee's directorial choices.An aspect of his directorial style I loved was the 4th wall breaking monologues as delivered by actor Delroy Lindo in the final act of the movie... It was a creative choice that I felt added more weight to the character. But then there are other aspects of Lee's style that just doesn't do it for me... And as was in his last feature BlacKkKlansman... he has a tendency to be overbearingly loud about his messaging when in fact he doesn't have to be. The historical contexts added into the movie (as displayed through a collection of images interrupting the flow of the movie) feel unnecessarily preachy in a script that has very little to do with any of it.Leaving all that aside, there's still a little charm left in the movie, courtesy of the chemistry the lead actors share on screen. And they all do a great job with the material handed to them, although I felt like the script they were working with could have been a little more accommodating to their talents.

I like how Spike Lee shows contributions of black soldiers in the Vietnam war, and how the Vietnam war is referred as the American War in the movie. Being a Cambodian, that is what we call it too. It also helps that Lee is able to show the different dimensions of the war, and how different sides view the war. He does this through the characters' speech. Though it seems unsubtle, it is seems real. I think he put a real effort to showcase famous black people by showing a black and white footage or newspaper picture of that person after any mention of them. For me, I actually liked that because I get to see more outstanding black individuals besides Martin Luther King , and Malcolm X. It may hurt the story but provides an interesting movie experience.
The movie begins as a story of elderly people meeting up and confronting there demons in Vietnam. The only person who never really healed and keeps getting worse is Delroy Lindo's character. Then it goes to thriller mode when tension boils after finding the gold. There are seemingly 4 wall breaking moments. Despite the unconventional approach, Delroy Lindo carries the movie perfectly. He is a troubled person, and despite his actions, we root and sympathize with him till the end. Chadwick Boseman, who plays the leader of the titular Bloods, Norman is very charismatic and charming. You really believe he could command the full faith of his squad. His death is as devastating to me as it is to the characters, and this takes a great actor to do that.
In the end, Da 5 Bloods is an unconventional movie that hops genres and provides a full range of emotions from thrills, humor, high octane action, sadness, and good feelings. It is a truly unique movie to enjoy.",Da 5 Bloods
123,mbhgkmsgg,Da 5 Bloods,7,19 November 2020,"Impactful and harrowing. Da 5 Bloods conveys the suffering of the Vietnam war and especially the suffering of black soldiers. It does so honestly and brutally. Although I didn't find it as good as most here seem to have done, it is an incredibly important film, especially in the world we currently live in.The thing that I liked the most was the way the visuals supported and advanced the story. The change to a 4:3 aspect ratio in the throwback scenes was genius. Add in the grainy filter and slightly changed colours and you'd think that you're actually watching an older film. The impact that that change in aspect ratio had was surprisingly big. It transported the film to a completely different place and time, and it took the viewer with it.The story, then, is of course what's most important in this film. It's a frightening story about the effects of war. The group of Bloods we follow all display in their own ways how much war can change a man. But the scariest of them all is the portrayal of PTSD and everything it comes with. Paranoia and distrust, mood swings and restlessness. Delroy Lindo portrays all these emotions in such a powerful way that it was hard not to get completely lost in his performance.However, as heavy and impactful the story is, I never really connected to it. I have read a plethora of 4.5 and 5-star reviews, and it seems that I just wasn't able to find the connections that others did. It is at least partly due to some of the more bizarre choices that this film made. Especially towards the end, some monologues completely break the flow of the film and make it hard to get back to it. Furthermore, these monologues aren't particularly important for the story.
Another thing that slightly bothered me was the introduction of the three characters that were there to disable mines. All they ended up doing was breaking up what was incredible chemistry between the members of the Bloods. As a Finn, I do appreciate every movie that gives screentime to Jasper Pääkkönon, but the trio that he belonged to ended up doing more harm than good to this film.Da 5 Bloods is undoubtedly an important film. It tells a story of oppression and loss. A story that is unknown to many. However, as a film, I felt that it wasn't as powerful as it could've been. As such, I didn't find as strong of a connection as I would've liked to. That didn't make the film any less good, it just made it less impactful than it should've been.",Da 5 Bloods

The group should have been a minimum of 70 plus. They all looked early 60s (the actor indeed were). And they used the same actors for their counterparts from 1968, white hair, beards and all. It looked weird. The Vietnamese girlfriend looked 40 (actually the actress was a very youthful 62) plus their daughter should have been mid 50's played by a 39yo actress. It just kept throwing me out of the story.Then flashing pictures from various historic moments made the story disjointed and they felt like fillers. It was badly written, directed and acted. I wondered if anyone had actually been to Vietnam to get to know the people who moved on from the conflict unlike this movie.I gave up when they started playing the arrogant Americans in a foreign country who know better than anyone. Gets too much after a while.It's a one, just wish I knew why...... story is 20 years too late and from an era no one can remember.",Da 5 Bloods

Lee continues his fine form after his comeback film Blackkklansman. Though I wasn't a fan of Blackkklansman because of its copganda and very nuanced portrayal of racism. Da 5 Bloods is his perfect return, the film tackles various subjects and has the perfect adventure scenes to keep you engrossed.The 154 minute runtime is definitely felt during some scenes and certain characters were underwritten but the visuals, setting and performances by Delroy Lindo and Clarke Peters make up for it. Having Delroy Lindo play as a Trump supporter was a great decision, he eases the role and is definitely a contender to look forward during the awards season. Chadwick Boseman appears only for a combined 15 minutes in total despite being the central character.The usage of historical speeches and images when narrating certain flashbacks gives us a new type of narration which we have never seen before. There have been several great movies about Vietnam war and its a sub genre that will never grow old. But hey, who cares about it if we get films like Da 5 Bloods?",Da 5 Bloods

It struggled to keep the narrative on point and was a bit of a mess in its story telling . Interspersing real life facts and images didn't compliment the movie . It only deminished both the tragedy of the war and distracted the from movie in general . Maybe the director should have made more of a commitment to either the facts or the fiction .

An exciting plot which unfortunately gets watered down due to the long duration of 2 hrs plus due to the unduly extended scenes, needless back stories and unnecessary sub plots. There is too much of heavy dialogue in most places. In an unnecessary lengthy shot ,Delroy Lindo, dead tired, injured, and delirious from a snake bite talks philosophy into the camera.( War veterans talking so much appears incongruous). The film speaks of heroism, brotherhood, greed, betrayal, redemption, morality , oppression of the blacks, racism etc etc. There isalso mention of ""Black lives matter"". There are scenes of a few bitter Vietnamese men blaming the vets for killing their relatives during the war. Clearly director Spike Lee wanted to cover too many aspects and the screenplay became too broad based instead of focusing on the mission in hand. Mention must be made of the excellent performance by Chadwick Boseman as ""Storming Norman"". ( RIP Chadwick you are being missed.) Acting of Delroy Lindo is also impressive.
The film would have been much smarter and gripping if it was pruned by at least 30 minutes .Presently it sags in some places.",Da 5 Bloods

130,Katz5,All over the map,6,7 February 2021,"Spike Lee's follow up to the vastly superior BlacKkKlansman updates Treasure of the Sierra Madre and thrusts it into a modern story about four Vietnam vets who reunite in modern-day Ho Chi Minh City. At first, it seems like the film will be about reopening old wounds and burying past grievances. Which it is - to a point. When the movie takes the group into the jungle to recover gold bars commissioned by the U.S. that they buried in 1969, it becomes a jumbled mess, with outrageousness that plays more like Tropic Thunder than Sierra Madre. The character played by Delroy Lindo (who is generating Oscar buzz for his performance) receives the most attention. There is a sequence along a delta deep in the jungle where Lindo's character encounters a Vietnamese chicken peddler that recalls the famous scene in Apocalypse Now where the crew interrogates a boat full of villagers hiding a puppy. Lindo is clearly still haunted and disturbed, which leads to several intense encounters with is son, who has joined the Bloods for the search for the buried treasure. And other scenes where Lindo insanely babbles when he's off on his own. Of course, this being a Spike Lee Joint, there is political commentary thrown into the pot, but it is not as vital as it was in BlacKkKlansman. Worth a watch for those who've followed Spike Lee's career since 1986. Not really worth the time investment (the movie is well over two hours) for others.",Da 5 Bloods

134,KyleLicht,"A 2020 Masterpiece of Cinema, Lee Doesn't Disappoint",10,29 January 2021,"12/12
This is the second film on my MLK Day antiracism watchlist. Like I mentioned, Freedom Writers was an outer circle antiracism film since it has a white savior storyline, but this film falls into the inner circle of antiracism, especially since it is a Black starring, Black-written, Black-produced, and Black-directed film that is made for black people and about black people.
Many antiracist films can fall flat when they are clearly written for white people to educate them on racism. Da 5 Bloods does not do that. It tackles the idea of race in many different ways, whether it's the treatment of Black people in the 70's and during Vietnam, between Black people and Vietnamese people, about what it means to be Black and celebrate it, and how it can tie history into the present. Lee has a masterful way of educating us on history. This film focuses on the Vietnam War but also greatly mentions MLK, Crispus Attucks, Angela Davis, Marvin Gaye, Black Lives Matter, and so on.
But anyway, this movie is a masterpiece of cinema, as I would expect from Spike Lee. It's a Spike Lee Joint 100% with all of his trademarks and psychological makeup of dealing with themes of race, manhood, and trauma. His style is bizarre and creative and breaks the rules of film and challenges viewers to look at things a different way.
Lastly, this was Chadwick Boseman's last film in his lifetime and second-to-last that he starred in. Having died soon after the release and having the movie revolve around the memory of his dead, admirable character, is double depression and absolutely heart wrenching to watch. Rest in Power Boseman.",Da 5 Bloods

Spike Lee has made some great movies but this is not one of them. I really believe that Spike Lee is a smart man, but a puppet to politics at the same time. He wants so desperately to play the race card in a time where everyone is trying to show the world how poorly minorities have been abused by white privilege. Because of his talent Spike Lee has amassed a vast fortune of financial assets from his stakes in the film industry, but this movie is a cry for help that he still feels it's not enough and if it weren't for being a member of a visible minority he would somehow have lire riches and more financial achievement. There's an underlying essence of bitterness in this movie that just makes me feel rotten to the core and I'm questioning myself over and over again whether or not I deserve to feel this rotten feeling that Spike Lee is desperate to drown me in, or if I'm justified in trying to find the positive outside of this horrible film to move on and be at peace with myself.

139,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Da 5 Bloods Completes the Mission,8,14 June 2020,"Spike Lee has written and directed some movies that were timely when they debuted and have remained relevant throughout the years. Do The Right Thing (1989) is 31 years old, but it could have been made right now and it would feel like it was ripped from the headlines. In a way, that's quite devastating, but it is great to have such an important talent thoughtfully creating work today. A new Spike Lee joint, Da 5 Bloods, premiered on Netflix this weekend. Let's see how it fits in Lee's stacked filmography.Da 5 Bloods is the story of four Vietnam veterans returning to the country to retrieve the remains of their fallen friend after almost 50 years. Delroy Lindo plays MAGA-hat wearing Paul, who seems the most affected by returning to Vietnam. His anger is palpable and there's anxiety at the surface on every interaction with the environment. David, an unexpected tagalong, is Paul's estranged son played by Jonathan Majors. Clarke Peters plays Otis as the steadying force with the logistics of the excursion mapped out. Norm Lewis is Eddie, jovially masking the pain of a life lived after war. And, Isiah Whitlock, Jr. rounds out this outstanding ensemble. There is also a limited performance by Chadwick Boseman as Stormin' Norman, the fallen soldier and erstwhile leader and moral center of the 5 Bloods. While there is an additional motivation for the remaining Bloods in the plot more than the simple conceit of recovering their friend, the importance of the Da 5 Bloods is what Lee has to say about African Americans in war for the United States and the continued discrimination that African Americans are subjected to in America. Like many Spike Lee films, come to Da 5 Bloods ready to be entertained and educated.As a film itself, the best assets are these veteran actors who put their hearts and souls into embodying these characters. Delroy Lindo gives such a full-bodied performance that he fills up the screen whenever he's around. It's very visceral and engrossing. Clarke Peters and Jonathan Majors also stand out as contrasts to Lindo. Peters is soulful and steady with every moment. I'll also mention that Marvin Gaye plays an important role throughout. Each song selection that plays drops us right back into the thick of that time - in such a complicated era. The soundtrack provides just that extra touch of atmosphere. For a movie that's two and a half hours, it doesn't feel like a long slog through the jungle.My issues with Da 5 Bloods are just some strange choices that either will bother you or they won't. There is a decision made about how to depict these characters in the past. It is jarring at first, but it makes sense why Lee made the choice, I guess. Also, I initially questioned the budget of the film when watching the first battle scene and helicopter aerial shot. It was distracting, but overall, not totally detrimental to the film. Lastly, there seems to be a tense between what the plot necessitates and what the film wants to say. They two work together in some parts better than others, which makes the film a mixed bag.Ultimately, I would say sit back with a bowl of popcorn and let the mind of Spike Lee take you back to Vietnam with Da 5 Bloods. I don't think you'll regret giving this film your time.",Da 5 Bloods

141,Mike_O_Dwyer,Jumble In The Jungle,6,13 June 2020,"There's a rushed feel to Da 5 Bloods, as if everything was thrown at it as fast as possible and put together without waiting to see what sticks. 4 old black guys go back to Vietnam, the son of one of them tags along, to search for the remains of a fallen colleague and maybe find some lost gold bullion. So far, so good, in an Apocalypse Now meets Three Kings kind of way.Everyone meets up and enjoys a night out on the town before heading into the jungle on their quest, which is all fun and games as the characters are introduced. Delroy Lindo is the big MAGA man, a forceful my-way-or-the-highway presence who doesn't need or want anyone's help. Clarke Peters is Mr Sensible, the smooth that holds everyone's rough edges together. Isiah Whitlock is the joker in the pack, and Norm Lewis is the flash guy. Obvs, they all have their faults which have to get exposed, because that's the kind of film it is.The trouble starts once they head into the jungle. everything looks like they walked along a trail to get to a spot to shoot, and then took five steps into the trees. It really looks like they're on a camping holiday and decided to shoot a movie while they were at it. They don't ever seem to endure the hardships of outdoor living so much as potter around slightly of trail for a bit before being cheaply rewarded by a hackneyed plot device - eyes roll rather than heads.Because they complete their objectives so easily there's nothing been invested in their struggle. There's been no drama at all other than a few flashbacks to Chadwick Boseman, his righteous charm guiding them to victory over an ambush before the inevitable befalls him and sets in motion the 50 or so years wait for his buddies to go back and find him. Yeah, it's a hokey AF premise.After the gold is found things kick off like a rejected Chuck Norris script. There's bad guys who can't shoot straight. There's good guys who spray bullets everywhere randomly without much by way of a need to conserve ammo. There's CGI puffs of blood that stand in such stark contrast to the real life footage shown earlier of Nguyen Van Lem being shot in the head, and how death by gunfire really looks - it makes Da 5 Bloods action sequences look like a COD video game in comparison. Awful. If you're going to use real world documentary footage of what actually happened to help set the tone of your story then tonally you need to have some grit, not cheap fluff.There's too much going on and none of it feels particularly well thought out to be anything other than a first pass at what could have been something with depth.On the upside, Whitlock and Peters are as watchable as ever - Peters is the glue that holds this all together. Lindo desperately needed better dialogue to get his acting chops around as he had the most showy bits, that he elevated what he had to work with to where he got to says more about his skills than that of the writers.Everyone else in the movie is a plot device, there to be used to create a reason for something to happen rather than to breathe life into situations.Maddeningly disappointing.",Da 5 Bloods

The film tells the story of four Vietnam veterans who years later return to find the remains of one of their companions and also a large amount of gold that they hid during the war. Basically that's the storyline in the first half because then Spike Lee makes such a sudden and implausible turn in the story that it doesn't stand on its own. This twist is probably the worst thing that could have been done to continue the story and if it were just that, the movie would be completely disposable. Fortunately, it has a lot to sustain itself through social criticism, the characters it includes and the background of the film, which ends up being really interesting.

146,PeachesIR,"Moving film, timely themes, a little convoluted",7,26 June 2020,"Overall, I enjoyed ""Da 5 Bloods,"" Spike Lee's newest film made for Netlifx. The cast includes some veteran actors in engaging performances, particularly Delroy Lindo, Clarke Peters and Isiah Whitlock, and Chadwick Boseman in an all-too-brief appearance only in flashback scenes. The movie follows four Black Vietnam War veterans as they return to Vietnam on a trip that is, on the surface, a reunion/nostalgia experience combined with an effort to recover the remains of their fallen comrade, Norman (Boseman). However, the four men have a secret mission: to locate a CIA gold stash they discovered and buried decades ago.Lee's bold directorial style shines in the flashback scenes most of all, where he switches to a nostalgic look and narrower screen reminiscent of early '70s movies. ""Da 5 Bloods"" combines humor and action with some poignant, sad scenes that explore the lingering emotional scars of the veterans and the impact this had on their families and relationships. Some of the film's flaws may be that it's a bit too long, with a plot that seems convoluted at times, as if they threw too many things into one script. A few of the minor characters, such as a smuggler (or maybe corrupt official? I couldn't tell) played by Jean Reno, don't ring true. The movie can be preachy at times, but I think that's the point, and there's a lot of chemistry between the four vets.

152,Metaflix,Noble Aspirations Can't Save a Sloppy Shoot,6,26 June 2020,"There is no more prescient of a time for Spike Lee to put out a film. He's arguably the world's most important Black filmmaker and his latest movie, ""Da 5 Bloods,"" hits screens at a time when race relations in America are at their most pivotal point since the civil rights era.Lee's films nearly exclusively center on race. To this day his debut feature film, ""Do the Right Thing,"" is not only dissected, discussed, and analyzed everywhere from the streets to academia for its filmmaking prowess, but also for the clarity and depth of what the film has to say about the Black experience in America.Not stopping there, Lee set his sights on the life and times of Malcolm X, turning out a three-and-a-half hour epic that lays bare the noxious pretense of equality in America that existed during Malcolm X's lifetime, at the time of the film's 1992 release, and still exists to this day.Lee's latest, ""Da 5 Bloods,"" is centered on four old war buddies from Vietnam who travel back to the country to retrieve a stash of gold along with the remains of their fallen friend.The opening of the film is not for the faint of heart. It depicts real life photos and news footage of some of the more horrifying memories of the Vietnam War era, such as the burning monk or the captive Vietnamese man executed in the street with a bullet to the head. Equally repulsive is the notion that war, oppression, racism, and corrupt politics isn't some figment of our distant past but every bit as widespread then as it is today.A number of scenes in ""Da 5 Bloods"" contain fun to spot Easter eggs or homages to its cinematic brethren. Some are rather obvious, like the ""Apocalypse Now"" writing on the wall of the dance club or the usage of the song ""Flight of the Valkyries,"" harkening back to the same movie. Others are a bit more meta, like the one-legged Vietnamese man throwing fire crackers at the feet of the protagonists, playfully referencing the terrifying ""Dance!"" scene in ""Platoon.""But as much as Spike Lee might've wanted ""Da 5 Bloods"" to represent his own ""Apocalypse Now"" or ""Platoon,"" it just isn't. Not even close. Far too many corners were cut while making the film for it to be considered in the same realm as such distinguished titles.Just look at the blood spatter CGI used throughout ""Da 5 Bloods"" as an example. It looks no better than the stock blood spatter effect in Adobe. Matter of fact, it probably IS the stock blood spatter effect in Adobe. Why not spend that Netflix money and use squibs? Alternatively, if the effect is going to make the film look like a B-rated zombie flick, why use anything at all?And what are the chances that someone looking for buried gold on the side of a mountain goes to dig a hole to take a dump in and his shovel hits ... gold. A million to one? A billion? Who cares because Spike Lee is an acclaimed writer and such mind-numbing coincidences should never make it onto the page, much less into the film?The full list of frustrating coincidences found throughout the film is about as long as this entire review, so I'll spare you the details. The bottom line is simply that ""Da 5 Bloods"" isn't the film we all hoped it would be. Spike Lee is among the finest filmmakers alive. Kubrick is Kubrick because he never settled for ""just good enough."" Scorsese is Scorsese because he never settles for ""just good enough."" After watching ""Da 5 Bloods,"" I find it very disappointing at how many times Spike Lee apparently settled for ""just good enough.""",Da 5 Bloods

Okay, this one doesn't do that. But that doesn't make it a bad film. It's a treasure hunt with a bunch of ""grumpy old men"". And it does seem somewhat unlikely in spots, but who knows for sure? Few of us have been trekking in the Vietnamese jungle. Delroy's MAGA character was somewhat extreme, but this is Spike after all; he's hardly a moderate. The film is a good watch, a bit long perhaps, but still engaging. Excellent work from a skilled cast and crew.

I'm skeptical when it comes to Spike Lee movies, some aren't always his best. But this one is pretty alright. It held my attention from start to finish, and of course, it's loaded with overdramatic scenes of battle, which I felt was very deliberate in the first place.As for the story of 'Da 5 Bloods' it's heavily reminiscent of 2008's 'Tropic Thunder' 1999's 'Three Kings' and it wouldn't surprise me if Lee got some inspiration from those movie. Despite being a comedy, 'Tropic Thunder' still sits as one of the best parodies of Vietnam War movies. But back to 'Da 5 Bloods, ' overall the story has that Shakespearean vibe to it that is common in some of Lee's films. Everything is purposely overdramatic but never melodramatic. The action scenes are parodies of 1980 Vietnam war movies. I think the runtime was unnecessarily long, but again, I think this was a nod to 'Apocalypse Now' with its ridiculously long runtime.Everything put into this movie is a nod towards previous films, but at it's core, Lee showcases the trial and tribunals of the black soldiers who fought during the war. Of how their relationship with the war coalescent with social inequality back in the States, something black soldiers had had to juggle with since the Revolutionary War. It's a glaring and interesting dynamic.All in all, I feel 'Da 5 Bloods' is a good Spike Lee film to get into.",Da 5 Bloods

Historical facts seemed jammed in, and significantly disrupted the pacing. The fight scenes were poor and came off as theatrical.

161,Thekeybaldemasterrises,Not Lee's best but still very moving and important,9,14 June 2020,"Challenging, thought provoking, and downright chaotic. Spike Lee's new joint Da 5 Bloods is a wild one, and he does not hold back any punches here. What starts off as a road trip/reunion film about a group of Vietnam vets looking for the remains of their old comrade and their treasure, turns into something brutal and raw. It's a war movie, but it's a movie about humanity too. It doesn't just signify the cost of war and the effects it has on the individual, but the hate that's created from it. What I love about Lee is his insistence on making the audience a part of the film and not just the ""observer"". When he wants you to see an image he really wants you to SEE it, and boy are there a lot of haunting images in this film. I think what people have to understand is this isn't just about the black experience of the war, it's the experience of being human and the path we walk. The character of Paul is a symbol of someone who chooses to walk the path of hate and how they refuse to stop walking that path. I'm a little bummed that Lee decided to make that character a straight up Trump Supporter as I find that to be less subtle and more likely to trigger people into turning on this movie since that could ignite it into a more politcal conversation. It's like Lee gave up some of the subtle tactics to ensure the audience is receiving what he's getting at but I honestly don't think he neeed too, the dialogue and the characters are profound enough to get that message across. Showing a MAGA hat becomes a little too on the nose and I know people are just gonna trash all over this movie for that reason, but hopefully I'm wrong. This isn't Lee's best film, but it's a deep and interesting one. I love how he cuts between different aspect ratios and makes the flashback scenes look 16MM it made it feel that much more immersive. I think he could've trimmed down the first half as it's at least 20 minutes too long, but that didn't stop me from really feeling moved by what he did here. It's a hard watch, but it's a necessary watch, and it only adds to the conversation right now of the black experience I can't stress that enough. It's a disturbing, violent, and graphic film, but it needs to be seen. 9/10.",Da 5 Bloods

163,jimmyjoe583,Don't trust the rating.,5,17 June 2020,"This movie is not good. I am disappointed as I expected far better from Spike Lee.
Delroy Lindo is almost unwatchable. A full blown psycho as he portrays him would not have lasted the 45 years since the end of the war. Why did they wait until they were 65-70 to reclaim the gold? So many plot holes! Spike should not have used the geriatrics for the flashback scenes. In a lot of scenes it was almost like Spike got tired of filming and directing and settled for mediocre, I would've said amateurish but Spikes been at it too many years.
Is it time for Spike to retire? Maybe take up writing?",Da 5 Bloods
164,ShaeSpencer,Almost great!,7,16 August 2020,"Delroy Lindo was so, so good. I loved what Spike did with that character. His arc is great. Jonathan Majors was very good, too.I loved the detail of using the fully aged actors in the retellings of their war exploits. It's such a good storytelling device. Especially in light of their idolization of the tragically ever-youthful Boseman, and, especially in Lindo's case, the arrested development inflicted by that trauma. I liked some of the stylistic flourishes, like the different aspect ratios and film stocks. Spike can be a great collage artist in that way.The core story is engaging and moving, though a few moments ring a bit false, and some of the stuff with the landmine activists felt extraneous.I felt the dialogue was very spotty. Too many lines felt like Spike using characters as his mouthpieces, with little to no nuance flavoring the on-the-nose sociopolitical stuff. People are so often saying exactly what they mean, in the plainest possible terms, and that grated on me at first. I don't know anyone who rattles off the precise dates of historical events as regularly as Chadwick Boseman's character. I wanted Lee to back off just a hair from shouting the film's messages so explicitly, and instead to more subtly lean into their inherent power, thereby enhancing and enriching the effect of that power. The consequence (for me at least) is that the film's aim feels somewhat muddled, and loses some of its depth. It's a shame, because this is a story rich with potential.With maybe one more objective pass on this script, I think it could have been great. That said, I'm glad Spike was seemingly allowed to make exactly the film he wanted to make.",Da 5 Bloods
165,ZuhayrRoha,Spike Lee's War~Politico~Gold Hunt,8,22 June 2020,"Vietnam war vets with PTSD plus post-war search for gold mashed with high level of politics.We have seen war movies. We have seen soldiers looking for stuffs in war. This is the same with high themes & politics and comdey sprinkled around.Gorgeous cinematography of Vietnam, the greenary was bursting out of my screen. The cast gets the job done but after hearing Spike Lee tried to get Samuel L Jackson, Washington Sr. & Jr. and Giancarlo Esposito, the movie could have uped its value much more for me. Delroy Lindo has already gotten oscar nom.Yes the movie is a bit slow and drags in some cases but it works to set up the characters and flesh out their past. Due to it being slow it actually feels like I am there with da Bloods, going to bar, seeing new & improved Vietman. But this flow becomes inconsistent, for example when the first mine-boom bursted, everything started to rush and we were hit with multiple incidents and they happen very quickly. If the movie slowed down in those areas our emotions for those characters could have stayed much longer.But man was it thrilling, that 1 2 3 scene was griping as hell. Well crafted. Speaking about crafting, the use of screen ratio for storytelling was a great idea.Now politics. I love that Spike didn't tell an one sided story, even had dialogues multiple times of how Americans themsleves talk about their one-sided history. It didn't shy away from showing Vietnam's people anger & post-war situation.
Money/Gold destroys people, greed broke this group. Paul wasn't just some Maga hat wearing 1 note villain, his movitations, his guilt, anger, flaws were magnificently explored and explained. Why he choose this side and hated his son, hated site of Vietnamese were boldly explored.
Him getting mercy from Norm in his own mind was beautiful character moment.
Spike didn't shy away from gore & violence (I actually heard there was ganna be high blood-shed from critics and truth is, I was a bit disappointed for less amount of blood)The movie taging everything with Black History - slavery, civil rights & BLM were connected perfectly and the theme of Black People, still getting oppressed, hits you hard multiple times. I know people with other agendas will have other things to say but I keep my agendas away from ART.I was disappointed with the cast not getting de-aged for war scenes but at the end when they showed an old picture with de-aged characters it just shows the war scenes played in their head with Norm still being young and fit, and them being themselves.Norm & Paul are Martin & Malcom and their views in opposite spectram where challenged and social commentary was explored perfectly.Some small nitpicks, most comedy didn't land for me and it dragged a few times, didn't care about some characters. But I respect the hell out of Spike for making this film.",Da 5 Bloods
166,MackMonMay87,"Spike Lee's Latest Bleeds Out a Bit, Great at Times, Confusing at Others",6,16 June 2020,"I generally enjoy Spike Lee's films, and consider many of his movies to be required viewing for any contemporary film buff. I loved 2018's Blakklansman, so I figured that Da 5 Bloods on Netflix would be right up my alley.The story of 5 black Vietnam vets returning to their former front, now-tourist-destination is sometimes charming, sometimes powerful, but all the time uneven.There are some outstanding performance moments here, especially from Delroy Lindo, who I haven't seen in anything for a while, and the always charismatic Chadwick Boseman. There's interesting filmmaking touches, like all the other members of the Bloods being their current-day ages as they relive the combat memories, with only Boseman's character remaining young in the memories, as he never got a chance to age.The 4 remaining alive have definite chemistry with each other, and in some of the comedic moments of the movie, had me in stitches with their jabs and insults at each other. There's occasional tense, confrontational moments that the vets have with Vietnam locals, and those scenes are taut and engaging because you can imagine that underneath the surface, there's still underlying resentment amongst many Vietnamese people towards the military and Americans in general. Those scenes flow well.What doesn't work is when the movie brings us in with a comedic, almost Hangover-like vibe (I think Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicolsohn were in an old-guy version of The Hangover not too long ago, right?), and it lingers on this portion of the movie a while, also introducing elements like Otis' long-lost half-Vietnamese, half-black lovechild who he's never met, that he then has no other significant interaction with until the end of the movie. An entire film could've been made about him reconnecting with his estranged daughter, and they don't even get much dialouge together.After they begin their treasure hunt for the gold that they stumbled on during the war, the movie turns towards a thriller-action vibe, stretching the limits of believability when the Bloods are still able to mow down modern Vietnamese fighters (although not without sacrifices on their end also). The intensity and extreme gore come out of nowhere, and the movie wasn't really marketed in this way, so it's pretty jarring.Delroy Lindo's character, a black Trump supporter, is a commentary on many aspects of modern American society and how our country deals with its vets, however some of his jaunts off by himself, speaking to the camera, get awkward and sometimes unintentionally funny because of how blunt they are. To be clear, what he's going through or what he's saying *isn't* funny. The way that it's framed and displayed, with zero nuance or subtlety, is what made me laugh.There's a lot of dialouge towards the beginning of the movie where The Bloods are getting guided around Vietnam, and they casually drop multiple black-history facts to one another in a very detailed and educationally explicit way. I have zero problems with a film displaying an angle of history that's too often left out of mainstream education. One of the reasons I enjoy Spike Lee's films is because of the perspective and the power he can convey from his experience.However dialouge between fictional characters still has to sound like what people would say to each other, and I have a hard time swallowing that these grizzled old vets would be trading historical facts with one another in such a plucky way. If it was a scene of them educating or speaking to an ignorant white person? Their grandchildren? Sure, that could be powerful. But as it stands, this dialouge and a few other moments in the film where the characters speak so bluntly and openly about history in situations where you wouldn't go into that much detail; take you out of the film.If Spike Lee wanted to make a documentary about black soldiers in Vietnam, I would watch the hell out of it, but if it's historical fiction, then commit to that.Again, it's not all a mess. A scene where Delroy Lindo's character saves his soon from mortal danger is especially tense and very moving. Almost every scene Chadwick Boseman is in is touching. There's good chemistry amongst the leads, and Spike Lee knows how to move a camera, he's a cinematic master, so in terms of visuals, the movie is smooth and stylistic, with a choppy grain used on the scenes from the past, but not to the point that it looks distracting.There was potential for a truly powerful story here, but I think Spike Lee should've chosen between a Nam film entirely set in the past with a young cast, or refrained on the amount of flashbacks with an aged cast, and gotten to the tension quicker.I would say that if you're a Lee fan or a fan of the cast, then it's worth checking out. But in terms of Black History, Vietnam films, or other works from Spike Lee if you're a casual fan of his, then there's other works you can go towards other than this one, which clocks in around 2 and half hours.",Da 5 Bloods

It's sold as being: ""Four African American veterans return to Vietnam decades after the war to find their squad leader's remains - and a stash of buried gold."" However the film is so focused on the gold, the brotherhood element which seemed core to the story ends up being fitted in where appropriate to fit the narrative.The inclusion of 'reality' within the film does help set the tone, but ultimately creates a confused jumble from flitting between being a history lesson to a piece of fiction, not helped with some of the odd editing choices.There's a lot of praise for the acting - in particular Delroy Lindo - but there is also some really poor acting which again creates another imbalance throughout.Ultimately, the movie is going to have a much greater impact given the timing of its release and what is happening in the World right now, however this doesn't detract from it being an uneven, overlong and disjointed watch.",Da 5 Bloods

It's just a cheap shot, aren't their enough black actors who could have represented the vets when they were 19, even though the scenes are shown at a smaller aspect ratio. What a piss easy way to shoot a scene, just change the ratio and make it look like a flashback, don't treat your audience like idiots and try to pass off your cheap ass tactics as some kind of post traumatic stress disorder. The son turning up and husselling his own father is pathetic.The vets bury a tonne of gold and fifty years later it's still there and buried 2"" below the soil, absolutely pathetic.

It is very popular in our country right now to beat up on white America so Spike Lee doesn't disappoint in jumping on in the band wagon. It paints a picture that pretty much only black men died for their country's , and no white men were drafted and had unfortunate circumstances when it came to Vietnam war. I understand it's supposed to be a black power type film but that can be done without being so blatant towards the hatred for the white man.
Other than these racial points the film as a whole seemed very lazy in the writing and acting. It's not an incredibly original story at all, and towards the end of this marathon movie that became way to long it fell flat on its face. I think that the action scenes were not very well done and again very unrealistic. It was supposed to be an adventure type film but didn't quite hit its mark.

This movie tells the story about this group of four friends who set off on a journey to find the remains of their fallen brother back in Vietnam, and also to gather up the gold they promised each other they would come back for when the war was over. I never usually have to squint my eyes when I'm watching a suspenseful movie, but after one particular scene in the film I had to squint when ever i thought something bad was gonna go down. there were shocking scenes in this film that just honestly scared me, because, you never know when you're going to die, just one little miss step and its all over. I wouldn't be surprised if this film was nominated for best screenplay at the Oscars, let alone Delroy Lindos amazing performance. The script was amazingly executed, i was wondering why the film was a bit lengthy, but after watching it, it didn't feel nearly as long as it was.

Howard Beale's speeches were not only timeless, but specific in the movie's longevity and warning to the future. The dark comedy became a drama, because what was originally considered absurd become FACT.But the trick there is that they weren't TRYING to make an ethical stand, or at least I don't get the feeling they were. In the vein of dark comedies, I though they were simply trying to put a story together, and they took it to its natural (albeit totally insane) conclusions.For the most part, make-a-point movies fail. Like this one did, for me.I'm sorry to say I wasn't able to finish this film. I made it just past the scene with Jean Reno in it, where Delroy Lindo flips out on him by using the same, tired, old line about how the French should be kissing America's butt because we saved them from the Nazis blah blah blah. I mean I couldn't BELIEVE Spike would use that crap in one of his movies. Murdered any chance of the illusion of disbelief in one shot, and that wrecked the movie for me.I also have no idea why he didn't use younger men to play Delroy and his Bloods when they do flashbacks. It's bad enough that during the only military battle I saw the V-C had an upper position, and outnumbered Delroy and the Bloods at least three to one before suddenly and inexplicably giving up the battle altogether. I would have thought the V-C could have simply waited them out, because eventually they would run out of ammo.I mean for crying out loud. They had to know the gold was there, right?Whatever. Doesn't matter. I wanted to watch a story, not be bludgeoned over the head with the same old ""black people have always been oppressed"" message Spike seems to be spouting these days. I'll always have a special spot in my heart for his masterpiece, DO THE RIGHT THING. I wish he'd figure out a way to recapture those days, back when he was a creative storyteller.Come to think of it, DO THE RIGHT THING is EXACTLY what I mean by making a message movie correctly. He told a story that was rich with characters and conflict, and managed to make a point in the process.This one's all about the point.

Really poor.To begin with swearing does not both me much, but it did here because it seems that all of the characters only knew one swear word, and used it in every other damn sentance. Seriously.

Paul (Lindo) has anger management issues and is ill-informed, of the three other Vietnam vets one takes opiods, one is a drunk and one a businessman who lost his fortune from spending foolishly. Spike Lee gives each of them redemption, but the redemption he offers Paul is off the charts, a truly moving scene (I think his name is a nod to St Paul).

But this one just left me indifferent, a lot of it I feel flew over my head, felt too forced and just wasn't great film-making.Its very clearly a film with a political message, and I think an important one at that. But it just keeps repeating it very explicitly over and over again and often goes off on a tangent, ignoring the underlying story and characters completely to trumpet that message yet again. It just feels far too forced at times, instead of flowing naturally through the subtlety of the story.I think its a film that might speak more to you if you're from an African American background, in which case this review might have been different. But as a European growing up in a place where there was not a single person of a different skin color, I think a lot of the themes and references in this film flew higher over my head than B-52s over Hanoi.As a film its mediocre at best.The acting is pretty good, by all of the 'bloods' and the scenery is exquisite. But that was largely it from the positive side. The war scenes are not very well done, and come off as cheap/cartoonish at times. The story goes off on too many side tangents with frankly preposterous plot points (in a film far too serious for those to be suitable) that drags it out into a 2.5h long yarn. A lot of that could have ended up on the editing room floor and would have made for a better film. There are numerous clear references to other Vietnam/war films (most notably Apocalypse Now and The Three Kings) and the film tries to take a little from here, a little from there, but in the end just ends up being a bit of a garbled mess with no clear sense of direction of what it wants to be.",Da 5 Bloods

One of the best movies of the year! Delroy Lindo is gunning for that Oscar, deserves and Oscar nomination, and should win.This is by far Spike Lee's most ambitious and violent film to date. The story may not seem like it plays out to something that will have relevancy to the current climate, but it's Spike Lee and he manages to weave in messages about society's pitfalls and the current political climate in ways you would never understand.One of the very best of the year to this point, and it feels so good to say that a movie is ""one of the best of year"" in a year that has studios are trying to kill movie theaters, a global pandemic, and more movies that are horrendous rather than great.DA 5 BLOODS belongs in popcorn heaven!",Da 5 Bloods
182,CryptoGuy,Bottom of the Coaster,5,12 June 2020,"Wow. There are brief moments, but they are so brief I can't even recall them. Da 5 Bloods plays as if a film student who really likes Spike Lee tried to make a Spike Lee film. There are shot call backs to every Lee film, even some familiar rhythm in editing. Moments of preachiness appear as with every Lee film, but this film handles them like a turkey playing checkers. As for production design and setting, it's rather cheap. Da 5 Bloods was made for Netflix and it shows. Not much care went into this film. Ultimately, as with every bad film, the problem begins with the screenplay. Even if Lee set out to make a meaningful film, he didn't stand a chance with the script. Spike Lee fans may forgive him for his ham handed film making here, but history will list Da 5 Bloods as Da Dud.",Da 5 Bloods

There is no way a professional reviewer could watch this jumbled disjointed awkward poorly scripted junk and praise it. So why the high reviews? Because the world needs a Black filmmaker to cover up the white domination of everything. But does that mean this film is good? How? The plot holes are not subjective, they are everywhere. The film does not gel. It jerks from scene to scene. As for good acting I see OTT acting from good actors. But they not good in this film. I don't know how you can be conscious bloods but distrustful, and always pointing guns at each other, or calling each other Ni**er, is this how normal Africans behave? Good thing I am African and we certainly don't talk to each other like this. So much for trying to create black value but then erasing your own work with these stereotypes and tropes. There are how many themes in this film? It ends up confusing itself. And us in the process. The score is horrible and does not fit. And how many useless scenes that add nothing to the story?

This is movie is fictional but it really explaines a lot about the current issues of society. I really do not understand the hate against this movie. You can't every Spike Lee movie to be like Blackkklansman. Some people just thought this was Spike Lee profiting, drawing more attention to himself using the events depicted in 2020(George Flyod) which can't be true. This movie started filming on March 23, 2019(wiki) so couldn't be filmed during the lockdown.

Nearly everything was bad...the directing, the script, the acting, the cinematography...and while I loved the music, it seemed so out of place. I love Delroy Lindo, and he did well most of the movie, but then much of his performance in those Spike Lee signature scenes showed just how poor the writing and direction was.I wanted to like this movie but it was just bad from a production standpoint.

190,guyzradio,A bungled cocktail of messages,2,13 June 2020,"A marketing executive once told me ""Advertising is like an arrow. The sharper the message, the better it sticks in the target."" By that logic, ""Da 5 Bloods"" is like throwing the quiver and hoping you hit something.My first reaction after viewing Da 5 Bloods was it's important to separate the film from the message(s). A movie that attempts to explore the racial inequities of the Viet Nam war, the effect on friendships of worshiping gold, the importance of family, the merits (or lack) of the Trump administration -- what did I miss? -- is unlikely to do a good job on any of them.Unlike ""The Green Book"" or ""Blackkklansman,"" which present narratives on racism effectively through well-crafted films, Da 5 Bloods is a heavy-handed, often preachy and disjointed commercial that self-dilutes the impact of what it tries to say. The end scenes of various organizations receiving huge gold-fueled donations includes Black Lives Matter, which seems to be presented as an afterthought. The story is predictable, and plays out like it was written for a high school literature class the night before it was due. All this is before even considering scenes, characters, and situations that qualify as goofs, anachronisms, and ""couldn't possibly happen that way."".Da 5 Bloods goes a step beyond the old cliche about killing the messenger for the message, and lets the messenger mangle the message himself.

191,lopresti-46927,Not Spike Lee's best but watchable,6,13 June 2020,"So in terms of what I liked about it it had a decent story, most of the characters were well casted. I loved Paul (Delroy Lindo) and the other Bloods. They had good chemistry. The story was decent and pretty well written. The end with Stormin Norm and Paul really got me. Probably one of my favorite parts of the movie. The production value was good. Spike Lee knows how to make a good, visually pleasing movie. The sets and shot locations varied from bars and modern day shops to serene jungle locations.
What I didn't like about it was the pacing in the last 45 minutes, some of the characters, and the overall character development/arcs. They definitely could have shaved off about 15-20 minutes off the runtime. And I'm not talking about the 5 or so minutes of film from various famous African-Americans from history and the events that shaped their culture; there's a point behind that. The attacks by Deroche's men on the road and the temple were too drawn out, it could have been compressed by 15 minutes. Secondly, before I said I liked most of the actors, but I didn't think they should have casted Chadwick Bosemab as Stormin Norman. His American accent wasn't good. In terms of character development I didn't see much until the very end. For example, Paul was pretty much the same up until that memorable moment with stormin' norm.
All in all like it says in the title not one of Spike Lee's best but it is still watchable.",Da 5 Bloods

I am impressed!!",Da 5 Bloods
193,hedin_88,This is not a Spike Lee joint.,1,14 June 2020,"On the heels of his previous film BlackKklansman that came out when it was indeed relevant, Spike Lee tries again, and fails miserably. The movie opens up at a hotel reception in Vietnam and some very bad dialogue that's too on the nose and practically gives the viewer a list of things that are of relevance without ever contributing something meaningful or intriguing the viewer as to why these men are relevant and whats to discover. In the next scene the characters are at a bar, dancing, (or rather just going through a crowd like they know everyone) and then sit at a table here again their discussions are perhaps relevant, but badly executed and without offering anything of interest to even better know and understand the characters, let alone to contribute to the entire film. Their personalities are relegated to their political views which are expressed so forcefully, it would be absurdist if it wasn't just bad writing.
In a short flashback we see whats the point of all this. Some gold and obviously, a dead body, a fallen brother. What throws the movie off its course is mostly the age of the soldiers. They are depicted appropriately as older in our timeline and the same age in the Vietnam timeline. There is no effort to relate them to one another, just put them in both scenes, its going to make it easier, nobody will notice and move on. When movies are so condescending to its viewer it produces a mode that throws you off the story. Coupled with the one character meeting a Vietnamese woman who was a prostitute and now shes a well off lady with a daughter, whose father is the soldier and who never know of his now 30 y.o. child. And two scenes are given to this, which bared so much weight on the character but remained undeveloped (if you're by now capable of calculating the age differences here.
The scenes from Vietnam are shot in the aspect ratio we all know from Vietnam footage and it sort of adds to the atmosphere of another timeline, but the way these scenes are filmed is so poor, its almost laughable. Spike Lee should have known that action sequences are something else. No direction, no orientation, who is who is where is irrelevant. Again, it borders with the absurd, reminiscing about Classical Vietnam movies which depicted whites in the same battle and even poses and dramatic deaths which bare no weight considering what happens.
They find the gold, a symbol of power for one and of freedom for the other. As the story progresses one of these four veterans steps on a mine because he delivers a pointless speech that started from a meaningless argument. He walks backwards as he speaks, the camera anticipates a sudden moment, making us anticipate it and in the anticipation the message is lost and the scene where one of the soldiers is killed by a mine in a horrible fashion remains uneventful. Spike Lee fails continuously as a director of action sequences and he fails in anticipation building as well. Then the son of one of the guys steps on a mine and remains standing not to activate it. Some guys that deactivate mines just happen to be i the same region and they cant help them. Did I mention they work with mines? (turns out they barely have any weight int he story, not as a love interest or a way to propel the plot). They tie a rope around the kid standing on the mine and pull it, and he survives, because they pulled him away before the mine exploded. Did i mention there is no point or explanation as to why the kid is there and what kind of relationship he has with his father, a Vietnam war veteran who later gets killed too.
The movie is on on hand a miserable buddy comedy, trying to paint these men as fun guys. Their political opinions are given, never elaborated on. At no point does the film utilize film as a medium, as Spike Lee has done many times before. At no point does the film leave food for thought. It is a poor execution of a hastily written film. The only reason this movie was made was to be as timely relevant as Blackkklansman, which it would have been if it was not written in a day and made the week after. Someone should have looked at the script.
Its a missed shot because it is so bluntly served its almost insulting to the intelligence of the viewer considering its timeliness. In time the films rating will drop as people re watch it and those who actually disliked it can say so. Spike Lee, do not stop making movies. Let film do the commenting.",Da 5 Bloods
194,mapika,overrated by the media critics,5,19 June 2020,"On Metacritic it's labeled with ""must-see"" with currently 8,2 stars by 47 critics total.Well, what a let down.The importance of the topic is undeniable. There are some good ideas, legendary, beautiful music by Marvin Gaye and a great cast creating a few touching and funny moments.Nonetheless the story feels too chaotic to be called outstanding! What's going on?! There are some cringe worthy, unnatural conversations, some Tarantino'ish bloodbaths and an Indiana Jones-like gold hunt, not in a good way. Also there is plenty of more or less known historical footage pressed in often too hasty, so it is necessary to pause every now and then to be at least able to read the text. I find this technique of film making for a fictional story quite lazy, especially if it's used so excessively often. (Other than with documentaries) It's too easy to make a film catchy by using real, uncensored footage of brutal events like executions.At least I watched the whole movie, but not at once. Needed a break in-between.In general I love the older Spike Lee's. After a long time and the high praise of the media I just expected a more genuine, profound, realistic, if too still artistic approach to this important topic.Concluding the only clever and genuine thing were the scenes, which looked like flashbacks, just with the same old characters playing themselves at war back then...first it felt strange, but I interpreted it as dream sequences caused by PTSD.

There are other action scenes shot 10x better that have more weight to them.

I have seen Do the Right Thing and BlackkKlansman, so I had high hopes for this one. I have to say: I was genuinely surprised by the quality and immersion this film offers. The story is a lot less chaotic than some of the reviews made me believe, and it is an adventure. It felt like I was part of their journey and I felt really invested in the struggles of the characters. The first hour felt a little slow and it seemed like it wasn't going anywhere, but the second half of the film had me hooked for the rest of its runtime. The editing was snappy at times, which made me understand why many reviews used the adjective ""disjointed"" for this film. However, the cinematography, character development, and blend of styles were a breath of fresh air for me. There was also a lot more action than I anticipated, and it was a welcome addition to an already exciting film. There were certain scenes that really had me at the edge of my seat. It might be a tad overlong, but the film does a lot of things right. Spike Lee shows that he does not only know how to discuss the notion of racism in a refreshing way, but also how combine this with his directing skills.

If ""BlackKKlansman"" explored the idea of what will happen to America if a racist yet powerful guy like David Duke or even worst Donald Trump would become the president of U.S.A,""Da 5 Bloods"" explored the theme/idea of not only the worst treatment the Black G.I. got during and after The Vietnam War but also the aftermath of Donald Trump's elections as the president of the U.S.A. and the riots whose people fight for the same rights the people from Black Power and Black Panther fought during the riots that happend in The Vietnam War.
I guess,you could say that in a way,""Da 5 Bloods"" could serve as a sequel or a spin-off to Spike Lee previous joint BlackKKlansman.
I really hope that this time,expecially with what's happening in America with the rights of all the black people,at The Oscars Spike Lee would get much more graditude for the work he has done and also some rewards to praise amazing movies such as his movie Da 5 Bloods.

This is an excellent effort though and features some brilliant actors who do a fine job in portraying 4 Vietnam war veterans heading back to Nam in search of buried gold and finding their old Sergeants remains, told in different style flashbacks which weave the story together.

207,kaneeddy,A Spike Lee Joint for the Ages,9,12 June 2020,"Da 5 Bloods, feels like an awfully relevant film to release right now, providing some powerful imagery and showcasing immersive storytelling. The film has all the makings of a Spike Lee Joint from the high quality cinematography that makes use of a diverse range of film and adds something genuine to the story, as well as provide Oscar Worthy Editing that transitions through aspect ratios smoothly. Spike seems to be on a roll with making some of his most powerful films off the back of his superb Blackkklansman. The performances in the film are Oscar worthy making you feel empathetic to the cause as well as giving insight into the unfairness African Americans faced when it came to the Vietnam War, the two notable performances in this film being Delroy Lindo and Chadwick Boseman, I loved both performances and will be some of my favourites for the year, also Jonathan Majors gives a noteworthy performance as well. The writing for this film is powerful and when needed, builds tension, relationships and the conflicts the characters go through during this film. I will also say the use of real footage throughout the film is extremely powerful and adds an extra layer showing the problems that the USA has faced throughout its history right to this day.If I were to pick out a flaw with this film it would have to be the score which was quite forgettable and at times didn't match the moment that was presented on film, and at times it could have a minor impact on the scene itself, which was quite disappointing as i found the Blackkklansman score to be memorable and matched the style of the film really well.Overall, Da 5 Bloods is a film that is extremely relevant and powerful, showing that Spike Lee is still in great form as a director 40 years in and is maybe better than ever. The use of the Vietnam war felt appropriate and the characters felt authentic. The performances were fantastic, and most technical aspects to the film were at an Oscar Level.

The intro and initial third is great. Characters are perfectly introduced and you're convinced of their strong bond/comradery. But then the rest suffers from weak writing and pacing, which makes the length even more unbearable.The soundtrack is awful. Whatever they were going for, I'm sure they had their reasons. But for me, it felt so out of place and made it uneasy to watch. In particular the action scenes.The flashbacks (constant cutting between past & present) were very distracting. At the beginning, I was enjoying the present day storyline with the present day characters. The frequent flashbacks instead felt like a nuisance.There were a couple of nice surprises thrown in and I appreciate the message it tries to convey.

I was really shocked at how awful most of the scenes and acting were. How a young Chadwick Boseman was in the same unit with 60-70 year olds was also laughable!! They never even tried to age the characters accordingly!!! How 100 gold bars just lay buried in shallow dirt for 50 years and NO ONE discovered them???? It was like Spike Lee had just discovered LSD!

I expected alot more and the worst part was the casting. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Delroy Lindo, Clarke Peters, and Isiah Whitlock fan, but why Spike chose to include 50 year old flashbacks using the same 70-plus year old characters is beyond me. Chadwick Boseman plays a 20 something year old Vietnam War platoon leader of Da 5 Bloods, but Lindo and company are the same age the whole movie. It makes no sense and would it really have blown his budget to cast a few more young people to include in the flashbacks? Nobody with gray hair is running around the front lines of a war. And the whole treasure hunt was a cluster-F#@*!I waited with anticipation for this film to drop being that my father is an army veteran of that era, although he luckily never had to go over there to fight.

Ultimately, the movie tries to link the Viet Nam war and racism, and fails miserably. In trying to fight the two different wars, it loses a lot.There's a lot of issues with the movie, but they come down to three issues:
1) It needs to decide which movie it's remaking. It basically tries to combine Treasure of the Sierra Madre, Apocalypse Now, and Three Kings and fails at it because of how different the three movies are.
2) The length; this movie could have been told much more effectively in almost half the time. I know it's trying to combine three movies, but that's no excuse for just taking too much time on things.
3) The over-the-top racism. I know this is a weird call, but the movie could have been a lot more effective had it toned down the racism. Also, some of the incidents involved contribute to the length of the movie without really adding anything.The apparent lack of any military knowledge on the part of Lee (the sheer number of military gaffes, such as salutes and ammunition) as well as the obvious call-backs to movies involved keep throwing watchers out of the movie.This had the potential to be an incredible movie, especially as the acting is incredible and the cinematography is gorgeous, but it's just too long and too many issues to be even a satisfactory movie.",Da 5 Bloods

226,shabanavdulaj,First of the biggies of the year and it didn't let me down.,8,13 June 2020,"I loved the first half. The first half it's calmer than what comes after it. In the first half the dialogue it is solid, it is slow paced, it requires you to put some effort into holding on to it, but it was interesting because Spike knows how to write rich characters, so even though slow I didn't found it boring at the slightest. I liked the way the film is structured. Spike wanted to make something special, and he has made something special, it's just that the way that some scenes are presented in the second half really disappointed me.The second half, and my problem with the film, it could have been so much better. Some scenes are so naive, they stand out from the overall tone of the film and the worst part yet is that I think that those scenes could have been handled in a better way with so ease, and I'm mad at Spike for not seeing that. I'll put it like this, the first half it has the seriousness of let say Apocalypse Now (minus the eerie tone) and in the second half you find scenes to the level of dullness you would find in a movie like Tropical Thunder. It's not to make such a big deal of, because the film works fine, but I really would have liked for those scenes to have been executed in a different way.The strongest aspect of the film it's the writing. Here is another proof that Spike is a better writer than he is a director. It felt so comfortable watching this war veterans talk and interact with each other and that's because Spike and his buddies knew how to write them and make everything look natural and organic. Both the score and the songs work perfectly for the tone of the film, they are the best part of the film next to the writing.This is easily the best film so far this year, even though that's not saying much taking into account the low amount of films that have been released this year so far.",Da 5 Bloods
227,SGuiliano1064972,A more in depth study of the African-Americans who served in Vietnam.,7,21 June 2020,"Director Spike Lee's latest offering focusing on four Black Americans who served in Vietnam. They return to find a hidden treasure of a fallen soldier (Chadwick Boseman), whom they fought with in South East Asia. I must say that this film is not one of Lee's best but the performances are great especially Delroy Lindo, who has to confront his demons. It's not a good experience for all of them. As in this time of the Trump Age, racial tensions and the Covid, it does point out that we have alot to do and a long way to go in the 21st century. We have a long way to go. As well for the other veterans (Clarke Peters, Jonathan Majors and Norm Lewis) They're willing to risk anything to recover the hidden treasure. It's fight for survival. Great cinematography with Lee appreciating Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam epic. Apocalypse Now (1979) and you do see it. With using Marvin Gaye tracks from his ""What's going on?"" album, you can relate as you view the film. To conclude this, I do like this film though are few flaws. But it's very entertaining but from a Black perspective.

I'm no racist, but this is sad, a sad attempt to draw attention in the most selfish way possible. Stepping on everyone else to stand on top makes you worse than any so called racist or so called problem at hand. Standing with and promoting equality rather than a victim mentality & pointing fingers as throughout this movie would be far more productive.

232,BecksyKane,Not a patch on BlacKkKlansman,3,12 June 2020,"As a huge fan of Spike Lee's ""BlacKkKlansman"", I was expecting big things - sadly, ""Da 5 Bloods"" is in no way; shape or form, on par with his 2018 blockbuster.There are many positives to this film. The editing was smooth (transitions of aspect ratios), the archive footage spliced throughout added a layer of realism to the cause/message of the film, I loved the numerous digs at Trump/Fascism, the way the Bloods romanticised Stormin' Norman, the Hannoi Hannah segments & the films social/political commentary exploring greed & patriotism.Several scenes are extremely tense & gruesome (the minefields/images of war atrocities), but once the men find their treasure the film begins to feel more like Indiana Jones (showdown at the temple & the double crossing) rather than depicting brotherhood/effects of war.The redemption arc for Paul, a misguided Xenophobe with PTSD is quite touching, however, the Bloods are shown in a very masculine/aggressive light (Paul's son is the exception). As Lee refrains from giving them an ounce of vulnerability, their performances come off rather lacklustre (despite Lindo trying his dam dest).Too often, the storyline goes off on tangents, the script repeats itself & the plot loses momentum. Lee overloads with too many ideas, leaving little room to explore issues such as the GI's fathering children with Vietnamese sex workers and the connection between Black-power politics & anti-imperialism. The film should have dedicated more time to actually detailing the war through the prism of black experiences, instead of simply implying it was hard.The ages of the men in Nam & present day are the exact same (minus Boseman's character), Tiên looks 40ish (when Otis is nearing 70) his daughter looks 30+ (it's all a bit confusing). The score was utterly forgettable & the presence of Marvin Gaye's music fitted really well with the films message, but sadly didn't really work in the scenes they were used in.",Da 5 Bloods

After the schlock-horror gore of the first landmine, I was set to switch off straight away, but persisted until they all seemed, at the flick of switch, to turn into B-movie villains.

237,LansTaylor,What an appropriate movie for this political climate,7,17 June 2020,"Spike Lee could not have released this film at a more appropriate time given the protest that's currently happening.
If the Oscars were happening this year I would put my money on Delroy Lindo winning the best actor award. He was amazing in this and his acting and Spike Lee's direction was so good. Especially the scene when he goes off on his own in the jungle and was talking to himself.
What a rollercoaster this was. From the beginning they are all hugging and having fun at the club but it gets more and more grim from there.
My favorite scene was when they were on the boat going past all the shops and Paul gets offered a chicken. The tension was insane and the series of emotions that Paul and the seller goes through was intense. Paul went from simply saying ""no"" to saying racial slur to crying and admitting that he's been seeing ghost to getting everyone together.
I didn't really like how predictable some of the scenes were. When they introduced Hedy, I knew that the land mines were going to come up later down the road. Speaking of that, Eddies death was so expected; when they showed a wide shot to Eddie walking backwards away from the group, I 100% knew he was going to blow up. At the same time, I didn't expect Spike to show us the aftermath of the land mine explosion.
I love the fact that Spike Lee didn't use deaging in the flash back scenes. I feel that having the present day Blood in the flash back was a great use of how memory works; you always picture you current self in old memories. Also, because Norman died, they all never got to see him grow old so he is always young to them.
The scene that got me feeling emotional was when Paul sees Stormin' Norman's ghost one last time and Norman tells Paul that his death was an accident, it wasn't Paul's fault and he forgives him.
All in all, another great film by Spike Lee and the timing could not be more perfect for it's release. The ending with the gold being donated to great causes like children disabilities and Black Lives Matter was very sweet.",Da 5 Bloods

As expected, Black nationalist themes are all over, the film's gotta' be woke.So, a bunch of old vets get the genius idea to go backpacking for gold in one of the world's only surviving communist states, venturing without a guide into the inhospitable tropical jungle, filled with snakes, howling unidentified hairy predators, and leftover mines from 'Nam.

He's not afraid to be brutally honest about his message and I really admire that.There's a great cast here, but I'm extremely impressed with Delroy Lindo and Jonathan Majors. Seeing Chadwick Boseman in this role, after his passing, is also surreal. That man had a hell of a career at the end of his life and I can't imagine how proud his family must be.There's a lot I could say about this film, but I don't wanna spoil it.

Do not trust any review of this movie that gives a review over a 3 at most. From beginning to end this movie is terrible.Lee tries to make a deep movie about the black experience in Vietnam and later as veterans of that war. Instead he produces a mess of a movie that is a muddled, yet forced agenda instead of a good story. Lee is better than this. But for every BlakKklansman he makes...there seems to be a big miss like Da 5 Bloods. Anyone remember Da Sweet Blood of Jesus? Exactly.So what movie did the critics watch? It wasn't the same one I watched. Are they scared to give Lee a negative review? Are they scared to trash a 'black' movie during the current BLM era? Who knows? But this is nowhere near a 100 movie.

248,Shazam-O,Masterpiece With a Masterful Performance,9,26 June 2020,"First and foremost, Delroy Lindo gives the performance of not just his lifetime, but of Hollywood's. With no hint of hyperbole, it is one of the best performances in film history.Lindo's performance aside, this movie sure does get a lot of hate. Obviously, anyone giving a movie 1/10 should just be ignored outright. People giving this film a 3/10 were most likely expecting ""Missing In Action 5"" or ""Da 5 Rambos"". They probably gave Extraction 10/10. Those giving the film around 5 or 6 may have missed the nuance. And this movie is ALL nuance. Given it's 2 hr 40 min runtime, if you're not following the undercurrent it must drag on like a row boat down the Mekong. The film takes hard turns between genres, so it is not a film for heavy eyes. Nod off for a second and you may wake to think you're watching a different film. And that's a good thing. It's a wonderful thing. It's no secret that Spike Lee likes to sprinkle his films with an homage here and there. Da 5 Bloods is no exception and he does so brilliantly. Every piece of historical footage, every character's action, each line, camera angle, and film style choice (and there are many) come together in a celluloid collage feeling somewhere between free jazz and the proverbial American Quilt.

With BlackkKlansmen and now Da 5 Bloods, he seems to have hit a stride with these relaxed, fun, perfectly enjoyable films.While I find Spike's activism admirable, I don't like preachy films. It's lazy to beat an audience over the head with your message. This movie is very guilty of that laziness and it is eye-rollingly hokey at times.That said, Delroy Lindo was hilarious and it was a pleasure to see him and Spike collaborate again. The techniques used such as changing aspect ratios and fourth wall breaking monologues only work when the tone isn't restrictive.

Biggest drawbacks was Spike should have used younger men for rhe throwbacks. It was very confusing watching old men play their younger counterparts. It distracted also from the emotional connection of seeing before and after. It would have given a higher reaction to the ending revelations. Crazy how it turned out but fitting.

I like how he captures the beauty of Vietnam. 7/10.Content/Impact: There are not too many movies about black vietnam vets and how the war has affected them. Additionally, the way that Spike was able to show unity and love between black men is beautiful and is rare to see on film. Also, Spike illustrates the trauma that black soldiers in Vietnam had to struggle with ptsd and them also being black in America.

I am seeing a Spike Lee movie after decades. It makes me wonder, has he lost his touch. Or was he always a mediocre director.
Every scene seems so very contrived and uncomfortable.
When he plays ""Ride of the Valkyries"" as the boat makes it way up the river, trying to parody the famous scene from ""Apocalypse Now"", it did not evoke sardonic humour, it just made us realise how very pathetic this movie was.
What is most comical is the corny soundtrack. During each moment of drama, the corny John Wayne music comes on, destroying any poignancy of the scene.
I would have given up an hour ago, but I plan to see it to the end, just on account of da bro Spike Lee.

Some friends as we watched said they didn't expect a history lesson & a treasure film of sorts. Now me personally as far as Spike Lee films go, it was decent not something I'd be like ""oh let's watch that one movie by Spike Lee again"", it's not like ""Do The Right Thing"" or ""Jungle Fever"", She's Gotta Have It"" ""He Got Game"", ""Malcom X"",there where a minor plot holes in the film & some discrepancies as well that were just clear as day stuck out like a sore thumb,but all in all like I said decent film, but nothing to be giving 4 or 5 stars to but everyone different.",Da 5 Bloods

There's enough originality and subject matter here that kept elements interesting, which was needed to compensate the sluggish pacing, and editing that seemed almost like a rough cut at times. It was something I picked up more often than I would like, considering how ridiculous it was only within the first act. Luckily enough, most of the cast held their weight pretty well in comparison to most other aspects in this film.In addition to mention, the late Chadwick Boseman is among the shining parts of it all, providing much needed charisma within the amount of screen time he's given. It's performances like this from Boseman that made him a rightfully respected artist that will never be forgotten. May he Rest In Peace.",Da 5 Bloods

The story highlights somewhat the disproportional numbers of black GI's sent to Vietnam to fight for the same country that treated them as second class citizens and yet put them in large numbers to the front of the of the war.The articulation of the story gets lost somewhat and the plot gets weak a few times. Delroy Lindo plays his heart out on his role but he is let down by the weak plot and carry through of the story. I was entertained and disappointed at the same time while watching this movie and maybe as a long time Spike Lee fan and I am a bit biased in my review.

A similar plot, but more relatable, was used in Three Kings. But what really killed the quality of the movie for me was the following scene: 4 old men are talking about their past and this dialogue leads to a scene that would be commonly defined as a flashback. This flashback brings us to a moment in time in the Vietnam War, inside a helicopter, staffed with some old men, and by old I mean very old. Yes, Spike Lee thought it was a good idea to have several actors, all in their 60s and not necessarily in good shape, play 20 year old soldiers. Why?
There are a lot of references Spike Lee inserted into the story-line that were taken from other movies that are, to a movie buff, needless and counter productive. Why?This is a bad movie with uninspiring dialogues and cheaply produced action scenes.

The script was just weak and narrow, predictable characters in a lame plot.If this ""Soul Brother"" was so ""down"" with Malcolm X, as Lee should have known, then he would have never gone to war for the US in the first place.If he wanted to teach about black Americans military history then make a documentary like Oliver Stone did and just stick to the film.But mostly it's the continuous agenda Lee has and his stereotypical characters in his movies time and time again, saved by all the great actors he gets. In conclusion, he's still a midget.",Da 5 Bloods
274,garyprosser1,An important message but a flawed delivery,6,17 September 2020,"Spike Lee's latest effort sees four Vietnam veterans returning to the country where they fought as much younger men in order to recover two things they were forced to leave behind. That's the basic premise but along the way, we see that there are three wars involved in Da 5 Bloods, one of which ended in 1975. The other two are being fought to this day by millions of people the world over, with no sign of a ceasefire.As you might expect, Lee's latest effort focuses heavily on the ongoing fight for racial equality. This is war #2 and Lee utilises his almost-trademark style of using narrative to educate the audience. Through the film's dialogue, the characters refer to icons of the Black Power movement, some of whom are household names, some of whom are not. It's effective and it's a reminder that for too many people, the wars they fight at home last longer and have more riding on the outcome than the wars they are conscripted to fight.War is hell, and never more so when one is at war with themselves. Each of the main cast was naturally and deeply affected by what they went through and what they saw when they were enlisted but it is Paul (played by Delroy Lindo) who most viscerally carries the emotional scars and continues to wage war against the ghosts of his past. PTSD always far outlasts the events that originally instilled it and long after the guns fall silent or the event concludes, whatever that event may be, the horrors remain.Lindo is far and away the most engaging character in this film and to be honest, his is the only memorable character in this film. Lee's script gives Lindo so much to do and so much to say and he is more than up to the task. The rest of the cast offer very little but that isn't their fault. That's the fault of the script.And here's why this film only gets a 6: the script is poor. Really poor, in places. The dialogue is hammy and cliched while certain characters seem completely unnecessary (most of them, in fact). I was more than happy to go along with what is a pretty far-fetched storyline at times but there were times where I just couldn't take the story seriously because of the amateurish script.All too often, the characters sound like the words they are saying have been written for them to say; good scripts make you forget this basic truth, bad scripts don't. Alas, this script is in the latter category and sadly, you have 156 minutes of clunky dialogue to deal with. The cast do what they can with the words they are given but the voice is only as good as the words it is given to sing.It's not, however, a bad film. The stars of this movie are Lindo, the awesome soundtrack and the stunning country of Vietnam. The messages the film extols are important too and well worth making again and again. Da 5 Bloods may suffer from the way it delivers these messages but what I took from it is that most wars aren't fought between nations; they're fought at home, between neighbours and they're fought in the mind.6/10",Da 5 Bloods
275,joeraid,Visionary Interrupted,4,15 July 2020,"Spike Lee, along with Quentin Tarantino, are two of the most thought provoking visionaries of their (and mine) generations. This one just fails on too many fronts. Acting is really bad, especially Delroy Lindo, who is usually great in everything. Story line is all over the place, bordering on ridiculous at times and nothing really holds this film together.
The filming is gorgeous though and the soundtrack is beautiful. The historical flashbacks and retrospectives were great as many folks today have no clue of the upheaval of the late 60's, especially of the influential figures like Angela Davis and Bobby Seale. Unfortunately, this film appears to have been rushed out (my impression) to resonate with the current political and social crisis, but Spike should have held off, edited it a bit and it seriously could have been one of the best films of the year.",Da 5 Bloods

That's not to say that this movie fails technically. But it excels at making you feel. The tone and chaotic nature of the movie are so consistent it had to be intentional.
As I watched an early scene in the movie I said to myself Delroy Lindo is AMAZING. But I thought this was just a good scene at the time. It felt like it came out of nowhere and yet so intense and genuine and uncomfortable and extreme. I had no idea that he was just clearing his throat. For years I've said Mr Lindo was an under appreciated actor. This performance deserves attention. I will loose all respect for the Academy if he is not nominated and does not win best actor.

The wars we have fought in both abroad and here in our (forcibly) adopted country.
The script is terrible. The story Lee is trying to tell is one that needs to be told, but I was extremely disappointed how Lee told it. He mixes in history, attempts at drama and comedy, and a really nice soundtrack and the result is a very disappointing film. Lee preaches too much.

In the pre-edited version I simply listed him as Black Panther bc of his fame from that movie. I apologize bc he deserves much more credit than I gave at the time).
What caught me off guard from the start of this movie were the flashbacks. I understood that all of the older men survived the war except OG soldier, Chadwick Boseman. What I didn't understand was that the older men remained old in the flashbacks. The whole point of a flashback is to ..... FLASH .... BACK. It was hard for me to see the same old men going back to Vietnam to find their friend (and something else), but look exactly the same as their modern day versions. Da 5 Bloods took a lot of liberties with reality, yet tried to be a realistic movie about black military men fighting during the Vietnam War. There are parts of the movie that work, like when the old vets reunite and reminisce. Spike Lee is a once in a generation director. I will watch whatever he produces.

Two oppressed races forced to kill each other. Psychology knowing they were not the real enemies of each other. Fighting for a country that doesn't love you is hard. Gaining friendships in such a predicament knowing they could die at any moment is harder. This is a psychological thriller.

317,steve-wilcox-613-243643,For once the negative reviews here are generally right,4,22 June 2020,"I've always taken user reviews on IMDb with a pinch of salt. Too often people have watched a film that is not up to their taste or intellectual interest. They then post a destructive and equally misleading review out of annoyance. Before watching Da 5 Bloods I had quick look at the downbeat opinions of this film and thought, yes more of the same uninformed trashing, or even trolling, of what should be a smart and thought provoking movie. Sadly, on this occasion they were right.Like others here, I too have great respect for Spike Lee and was expecting a film equal to his honest and outspoken political views. But this isn't it. As has already been said, it's a mess. It is entertaining in parts but there are too many ideas, at least two too many subplots and a lazy expectation that the viewer will accept weird concepts such as the main protagonists looking exactly the same before and after fifty years have passed. Or that a war-baby daughter born circa 1970 would be around twenty-seven years old now in the time of President Trump. That along with the all too obvious ad-libbing going on between the otherwise brilliant cast underlines the kind of lack of discipline that the younger Spike Lee would have scoffed at.Earlier Vietnam War films were referenced in criticism or homage; Rambo, Apocalypse Now. But a prominent, and completely unnecessary, plot twist actually reminded me of Tropic Thunder; a film which blatantly satirises Hollywood's sidelining of black actors (in the shape of Robert Downey jr's character's outrageous use of black face). In that film and this a remnant if the past is triggered in exactly the same way and the cast are sucked into a mini re-run of the Vietnam War complete with bloodthirsty Quasi-Vietcong stereotypes on their tail. I don't feel good making that comparison this is a Spike Lee film after all!There is a good movie in there, it just needs a really good re-cut!",Da 5 Bloods
318,tygarr13,Poignant Subject Matter Poorly Presented.,7,13 June 2020,"I eagerly anticipated viewing Da 5 Bloods, especially since Miracle at Saint Anna is my all-time favorite war movie and also my favorite Spike Lee Joint.Da 5 Bloods is a tale of aging Nam vets (and a grown son) bickering among themselves and cheesily expressing dissatisfaction about race relations while on a return journey to Vietnam to retrieve the body of their fallen comrade and a cache of gold bars stashed there during the war.The senior citizen vets acting as their younger selves in flashbacks, the inclusion of photos of historical Black persons (i.e., Aretha Franklin?), an MLK speech, and a Black Lives Matter meeting had me wondering if the 'shrooms were finally kicking in, before I remembered that I have never taken 'shrooms!Da 5 Bloods comes across as if a bad war movie, combined with circa 1960's and contemporary 2020 civil rights takeaways, and almost every Vietnam war reference, were all spliced together for Black History Month.I am a Black American military veteran in my 60's, a fan of war film and (most) Spike Lee movies, and I am still a fan of ALL of the Black main characters (despite their substandard performances here).

And I'm really writing this review to combat all the really negative and horrible reviews written by many people here.This movie is not awful. Is it great? Not really. But it's an enjoyable watch with genuine heart and an ultimately good message. And admitedly, at the same time as being a fun adventure story, it's also a piece of anti-war, anti-trump, and black lives matter propaganda. But hey, I like this propaganda, because I agree with all those causes.And it's true this film has it's issues. The editing is fairly poor, and the plot a bit unbelievable. But I don't think those things ruin the film. So all in all it's an enjoyable adventure romp with likeable characters and heartfelt intention.Check it out if you've got nothing else better to do. :-)",Da 5 Bloods
320,JRodFilms,Delroy Lindo Shines in Spike Lee's Da 5 Bloods,8,19 June 2020,"Da 5 Bloods, the Spike Lee film exclusively available on Netflix, premiered in June of 2020, and lately I have been somewhat lacking in the film reviews because I think if I don't tackle it right away and put a review up within the films premiere that it's essentially old news. And I almost felt my review as old news as I started writing it. I became uninspired and quit the review altogether.But then I scrolled through some movie forums and became inspired again, especially when I thought about the performance of lead actor Delroy Lindo, who plays Paul; one of four living Bloods who return to Vietnam to retrieve lost gold, where it is buried along with the remains of the deceased Blood, Norman, played by Chadwick Boseman.Da 5 Bloods begins in a at times awkward first act, opening with all 5 Bloods in Vietnam and the ensuing helicopter crash which sets up the forthcoming adventure to seek the gold. We are then shifted into present with the four living bloods, Paul and his 3 other Vet buddies Otis, Eddie, and Melvin, played by Clarke Peters, Norman Lewis and Isiah Whitlock, Jr., respectively, arriving in Vietnam and begin to get re adjusted to their surroundings. Paul is later surprised at the hotel by his son David, played by Johnathon Majors, who appears throughout the film wearing Moorehouse attire.Before Da Bloods head out on their adventure, some unfinished business needs to be settled between Melvin and a former lover, meanwhile Paul and David make a decision that David will get the deceased Blood's share of the gold if they are to retrieve it.Da 5 Bloods gave me feelings of Apocalypse Now from the opening movie themed dance party, to the nostalgic soundtrack filled with songs from Marvin Gaye and others, to the technical aspects of the film: including shifting aspect ratios between the present and flashback footage of the younger Bloods in Vietnam and most importantly the powerful performance from Delroy Lindo, which evokes a often times 'decent into madness' as I like to call it, that needs to be mentioned along with other great performances.With as much as I did like I did find some flaws with this film, as I mentioned before, the first act felt awkward to me. I would recommend having some patience, to give the story time to build. Spike Lee recently praised the composer of this film, however I felt the score, especially at the beginning of the film did not fit, it just jumped out at me and not in a good way.I felt the flashback scenes should have had younger actors, with the only one being Chadwick Boseman. The makeup was not convincing, and as great as the performances were, it was another thing that jumped out as pretty noticeable to me.For the flaws the film does have, I feel is redeemed by the end of the film. And most importantly I felt the film grow as it progressed. And when most of the time I feel, that films fizzle out especially during their middle act, Da 5 Bloods actually kept getting better and better. So thats why I say give the first act a chance because I feel it pays off in the end,
Spike Lee has been in an upward swing lately with Academy Award Winning 'BlacKKKlansman' from 2018 and 2020s Da 5 Bloods, which sees him tackling current political commentary and being able to blend it with past history grievances so well that even if you don't agree with his politics, it is impossible to deny his talent as a storyteller and filmmaker.",Da 5 Bloods

I was enjoining the movie for about the first 1.75 hours of it. After that I just wanted it to get to the ending. I did enjoy the finale at the end but just wish the movie arrived at the finale sooner. But, all of the great directors seem to not shy away from the length of the film. They all seem determined to tell their story and not be limited by the length of the film. I watched the Spike Lee interview on Apple TV+ afterwards which helped put the length in perspective. Spike Lee reminded me that he wants to tell his story. I respect that. Not just in Spike Lee but in all of the great Directors. It seemed to me that after he made the movie he decided to splice in some history lessons then tie the movie to current events but, Spike Lee would have to explain if that was indeed the case.

324,jeremyfrydman,The Best New Release This Year So Far,8,12 June 2020,"Da 5 Bloods is one of the best and most powerful films I've seen in a while. It's not a perfect film but it's really close to being one.It tells a story relevant to everyone today, it has some of the best performances of the last three years. It's got a tremendous screenplay and brilliant cinematography.I got to talk about the performances first because they are sublime. Delroy Lindo gives a career-best performance as Paul. Lindo steals every scene he is in with his ferocious and sometimes vicious performance which will stay in the front of your mind for weeks after the film is over. There's something so haunting, yet beautiful about this performance and this character. I seriously doubt there will be a better performance this year, the academy better get this blood his oscar. In his limited screentime, Chadwick Boseman is terrific. His performance is empowering and it wouldn't surprise me if his character grows to the iconicity of Radio Raheem in the future. Some of the supporting cast, unfortunately, isn't great, especially some of the Vietnamese and French characters. They don't deliver their dialogue with the slickness that other characters do and it makes them stand out in a film full of great performances.The screenplay is a haunting and somewhat upbeat statement about war and love. The film reminded me of Radio Raheem's iconic speech about love and hate in Lee's most well-known and praised picture, Do The Right Thing. The screenplay is brilliant if not a bit messy, but I can forgive the messiness for the bigger picture that the film is trying to convey.The cinematography is bleak and disturbing. I'll say off the bat, there is a lot of bloodshed in Da 5 Bloods, all of it is terrifying. I've never seen a film where death is shown in such a real, graphic and terrifying way. It almost makes you feel like you're back in the war, like our main characters. When entering a flashback the film changes its aspect ratio to one commonly seen in the '60s. I am a huge fan of this choice and it adds to the style of the film.In finality, Da 5 Bloods is a really great film. Aside from its flaws, it is a truly great film that will spark a shit-ton of conversation.",Da 5 Bloods

It occurred to me that there was no way to make a parody of this movie because it was already a parody of itself. This is a terrible movie. Terrible in every way a movie can be terrible. The dialogue is ridiculous. The storyline is even more ridiculous. Spike Lee has absolutely no idea about nuance or subtlety. I suppose if you watch it as a comedy,You might enjoy it. But, if you all want to take this is a serious movie you are out of luck. If you do watch the movie make sure to stick around long enough to see the absolutely ludicrous scene where they try to get one of their travelers off of a land mine.

328,johnterrell-67238,A Mixed Bag (yet still compelling),7,21 June 2020,"Da 5 Bloods is the new movie by director Spike Lee. The film has been very divisive since its release as I've seen some people claiming it as the best film of the year, and others claiming it is just plain pretentious schlock. Me, I would fall into around the middle of these two, feeling just a bit more positive to the movie, but not loving it.
The movie is about 4 Vietnam veterans as they go back to find the gold they hid so many years ago. They also go back to find the body of their old friend (Stormin' Norman) who was killed in the war. The film explores themes of racism in the Vietnam war, and much more social commentary within it as well.
I will say that this might be Spike Lee's most ambitious movie as it delves into so many themes and different genres. However, the movie falls under its own ambition far too much. Due to how many things Lee is trying to do, some of it feels very unfocused and jumbled together. The first half of this movie is another thing people are really criticizing as well. I actually enjoyed the first half to a certain extent, but it is extremely heavy handed and it was frustrating that Lee felt the need to tell us everything the characters were feeling and every message he wanted the audience to receive. It's not even really a case of a movie ""telling not showing"" because here the movie is doing both. It's showing us enough for us to understand the characters and the themes but it decides to add a unneeded monologues that explains it to us. The first half of the movie does set up quite well for the second half.
For the most part I do think the protagonist are pretty good. Two of the main 4 protagonist however are kind of underwritten (Eddie and Melvin). They are given minimal character qualities...especially Eddie. However, Otis and Paul were very interesting the whole way through, especially Paul played in glorious fashion by Delroy Lindo. Even though there hasn't been very many movies to release in 2020, so far as of June 2020 Delroy Lindo is my choice for best performance of the year. He dominates every second of his screen time and Lee uses this great performance to his advantage and it is a real reoccurring highlight in the movie. I also really like Clarke Peters' performance as Otis. One thing that kind of annoyed me however is that the characters don't always react naturally to some events that happen in the film. The scene that kickstarts the second half of the movie (I won't spoil it but if you've seen it you probably know the one I mean) should've gotten a bigger reaction from the characters but they never really mention it after the sequence is over. This happens to a smaller extent multiple times within the film as well.
I have been criticizing it a lot so far, but there is definitely a lot to like in this movie. I really like the second half of the movie for the most part. It ramps up the intensity to full volume and we lose the heavy handiness from the first half. There is also an extremely touching scene towards the end with Chadwick Boseman's character (Stromin' Norman) and Delroy Lindo's character (Paul). The scene is pretty beautiful and I've already found myself rewatching that one scene. That's another thing that's really good about the movie, just Chadwick Boseman in general. They hype up the character of Norman a lot, and his performance makes us believe why they were so connected to him. Towards the end we also just start getting a lot of really good scenes. The climax I do find to be really generic. The antagonist who is revealed towards the end is just plain cartoonish. The resolution I find to be okay. It's not bad but I wasn't completely satisfied or anything.
By the end of the film I was just kind of mixed. I liked a lot of things about it as I was interested in most of the film. I also really liked the thought provoking themes (even if they were a bit heavy handed). However, there is a lot holding this movie back. It feels decently unfocused most of the way through, and at times feels like multiple genres and multiple movies at the same time. I don't know exactly what to feel about this movie as I think I like the movie enough, but it's frustrating to see what could've been a great movie just turn out kind of decent.

329,coonyp,A blatant remake of a great film,8,2 January 2021,"One of my favorite movies ever is John Huston's Treasure of the Sierra Madre. I have watched it so many times that I have memorized the script, much of which was lifted literally from the book. Each scene is perfectly paced. But the film does have a major deficit when compared to the source material as the novel is perhaps the most important that I have ever read. The longer I live the more I realize that our political outcomes, much of which are negative and defy logic, are the result of our unconscious human impulses. Perhaps the most significant paradox is the reality that poverty is often characterized by generosity whereas wealth generates anti-social impulses. This idea is presented repeatedly in the book. Probably due to Hollywood's need to avoid political controversy, John Huston was able to craft a film in which this idea was presented so obliquely as to be virtually lost.In contrast Spike Lee's Da 5 Bloods retelling of this story involves no such subtilty. It may be his best film ever. It is visually stunning even if its pacing and construction does not compare to the original film. But thankfully the politics are not hidden. In particular, it correctly preaches that racism is related to the effect of economics on our depressing human condition. The ultimate disintegration of the racially unified five bloods was occasioned by this truth.",Da 5 Bloods

Coincidentally, this movie so much relevant to what's happening now, it shows after nearly 5 decades, there is so much that didn't change for black people in America. Da 5 blood also has decent characters with different ideologies and how they changed since the war. As like Every Spike Lee movie, Da 5 Bloods, Daringly talks about different social issues, political conversation.Spike lee choice to show real footage of a massacre of innocent Vietnamese people, the oppression of black people, Martin Luther's speech, so many real events relating to the issues of America is impactful and powerful. The changing aspect ratio for different acts is cleaver. Movie is 2hr 30min, with Spike Lee's amazing, captivating direction it doesn't seem long to me. The film changes pace in the second hour where the characters start the journey into the forest to find treasure, where it gets intense, emotional, violet, and spike lee brilliantly captured it all. The references to Apocalypse Now (1979) Movie and Marvin Gaye tracks are quite enjoyable.The notable performance by Delroy Lindo is observing. He's struggling with PTSD and emotional performance is phenomenal.Cons:First, I love social messages in movies, but forcefully inserting many, without actually serving any purpose to the main story, seemed muddled and messy sometimes confusing, what's the movie about.The same actors played in the present play their younger self 50 years ago, Without any visual effects, prosthetics why??The background score doesn't sink with scenes, it felt like the orchestra team given the music without knowing the tone, emotion of the scene. And the worst part, for some scenes, B.G.M dominates the dialogue.It's certainly not the beast spike lee movie, but still a good movie.

There are some interesting plot points, the basic story idea is good..But the script does not tell a good story. The added bonus pictures strewn in add nothing to the story. They just distract and chop things up.
The cinematography is nice. It's filmed well... The special effects were fine in the battle scenes. It was pleasant to watch.
The acting was good. It was a good cast.
If you think of it as just another war movie, rather than a Spike Lee movie, it's ok I guess.

I have to give Spike Lee credit for making a movie that is definitely not a crowd-pleaser. Many people will be put off by the heavy-handed imagery and symbolism, but if you can get past that, you might enjoy this movie. The actors were great. Delroy Lindo, Jonathan Majors, Clarke Peters, Norm Lewis, and Isaiah Whitlock Jr. played off each other beautifully. They had great chemistry and I truly believed that they were brothers that went through some tough deal in the war. Chadwick Boseman was great but he isn't a big character as much as he is a big presence and device that moves the story forward. The marketing team really made a disservice to the story that is really the driving force of this movie. The music was good, the cinematography was excellent and very unique with the whole changing ratio according to the time period thing. The editing is weird at times but I got over that rather quickly since I was so interested in what was happening. The CGI is straight-up bad and it's even worse considering that Spike has the authority and probably the budget to make practical blood squibs. The green screen is very noticeable at times but still, I ignored it in tried to enjoy myself. Still, I found myself predicting many of the events in the films a long time before they happened. I am going to give it a 7/10 because I did find many flaws and the plot got kind of predictable at times. There were some heavy-handed symbolism and an exposition scene that I dreaded. I will still recommend it to anyone that asks me about the film.",Da 5 Bloods

345,lilbuch22,Da 5 Bloods Review,10,15 August 2020,"Da 5 Bloods is a movie about brotherhood, friendship, war, the effects that things we do can have on our lives and racial injustice. I will say this is not a film for everyone. That being said, it is extremely powerful and entertaining with a very strong message. I think a lot of people will really enjoy it from the way it's shot to some really incredible performances lead by Delroy Lindo who seriously deserves an academy award for his work in this film. It is a blend of satire and political commentary with a mixture or violence and shock as well. The film from a writing standpoint is truly unpredictable but that is one of it's main strengths especially when the pacing of the film picks up dramatically in the second and third acts. I was moved and enjoyed every second of it. I loved how the film was shot for each different point in time this non-linear story is conveyed. I also loved how the editing kept the pacing in a forward building direction until the explosive climax. Even from reading reviews on here I think this will be a very divisive film especially with everything going on but that being said it is a very well made movie with a strong message, and a clear contender for the Best Picture Oscar.",Da 5 Bloods

It discusses many themes using the stories of 4 Vietnam war veterans along with their dead comrade and other people involved.That is also the weakness of this movie - it's a mishmash of everything in one movie. It isn't as solid as I would liked it to be. The pacing is numbing at times.Considerable pros are the beautiful scenes and good music.It's a 6/10.

But overall the film is unfocused and the story doesn't hang together well. Most of the characters feel unreal and lacking something. There's also a weird, mischievous tone to the violence - Tarantino-esque - which jars with the more serious subject matter. A weird one, all told. If you're expecting something like BlackkKlansman, you'll probably be disappointed. Try to go in without those expectations and you might be entertained.",Da 5 Bloods
350,beatsavior420,Da Apocalypse of Sierra Madre as directed by Malcolm X,7,16 July 2020,"Just caught Spike Lee's newest joint, and all I can say is, ""shiiiiiiiit."" Da 5 Bloods is certainly topical, certainly divisive, certainly hot button and frothing with the rage of this day and age, and I was blown away by this film. Even though I haven't necessarily agreed with all of Spike Lee's political sentiments over the years, I have watched every one of his films, for he is a master of the craft, a damn good storyteller, and one of the last living auteurs still telling the stories he wants to tell. Like all Spike Lee joints, Da 5 Bloods, is a time-capsule of Black American History delivered through a prism of the brutalist American experience. But its the chemistry of the lead group of actors that drives this film for me. Their nostalgic yet trauma-soaked quest back into the jungles of Vietnam to dig up the bones of their old army sergeant, and a bunch of gold bars, makes for an exciting tale. The movie may be a little long, a little clunky at times, and most definitely heavy-handed, but the heavy-hands pack a punch, and I like being punched by a movie. Delroy Lindo should most certainly get an Oscar for his mesmerizing and tragic performance. And if you've ever wanted to see a mash-up of Apocalypse Now and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre as directed by Malcolm X, look no further, this is the film. 7/10",Da 5 Bloods

How many times was this rewritten? Some will give it kudos just because it's Spike Lee. But it's a mess and way too long. And interspersing real and often graphic images from the war just makes the violence in the film seem pathetically portrayed. Too far fetched to believe the team of people searching for unexploded land mines would stumble upon the ""five bloods"" in the jungle of Vietnam. And the telegraphed mine explosions were not surprising at all. The intentions were good. The execution is a preachy mess. How this got such good metacritic reviews is beyond me.",Da 5 Bloods

I love Spike Lee from the first movie, not this one.
I found it so full of fake rhetoric. The plot is not working at all. Illogical or stupid most of the times. Characters and behaviors out of any reasonable meaning.

357,elliottyoung,Don't Listen to Reviews That Don't Know Your Culture,10,14 June 2020,"First of all, this film is not ""pointless"", nor is it a waste of time. It's a film that not only pays homage to real life Black Soldiers who were used and abused during the unjust Vietnam War, but for film historians, there's a tinge of homage to the Treasure of Sierra Madre when it comes to how the plot unfolds. Furthermore, for everyone complaining that the music is misused.....you know NOTHING about the relevancy of black music in each era of American history because if you did, you'd know that not a single track used throughout the film was irrelevant to black reality in the Vietnam era. As far as the age discrepancies, fine, that's fair, but how many films have you seen in your life where age accuracy hasn't been on the money? As far as the acting is concerned, everyone did a fine job, especially Delroy Lindo. This is a quality product that deserves at least one viewing, and it's time to stop letting mainstream voices, who are not aware or sensitive to other cultures, dictate what deserves to be seen, and what doesn't. THINK FOR YOURSELF. PS, Spike Lee makes movies as love letters to his cultural base. So YES, he will incorporate historical facts, that are normally ignored by everyone else, into his love letters because that's what commemoration and celebration is all about. If you resent that style, stop watching Spike Lee movies. Are all of his films masterpieces? Maybe not. But whose are? Bottom Line....Da 5 Bloods was a respectable effort by all involved.",Da 5 Bloods

So I feel almost badly saying this but what the hell happened with this movie?? Like I said earlier there's so many goofy choices made by Spike that I don't know how or why he made those choices. I would say beware and if you do watch it, you've been warned & you'll understand afterwards when you're shaking your head at a lot of different mind boggling parts in this movie.

364,dander-56917,Chaotic but good?,6,14 June 2020,"I personally really wanted to love this movie, the Vietnam era is great with its music and changes in culture. Some of the best films ever made have been about the Vietnam war. So I was readily anticipating its release.The characters were interesting and you could feel the chemistry between them, Delroy Lindo was especially good playing the conflicted Paul his monologue into the camera was unusual and made you feel uncomfortable as if you had become a part of his mind. I also loved the change between the Vietnam war and present day in camera, colouring and the change in aspect ratio.I don't understand why people hate the fact that the characters were not de-aged in the war, I think it helped you get attached to them and not separate them as two characters as who they are today was made in the war.
I thought the scene were David, Paul's son, was stuck on a mine was particularly good, drawn out and riddled with suspense.However, the film is too long some scenes could be shorter and it could've been edited a lot better. My biggest pet peeve with it was how they discovered the gold, I mean what are the chances David would dig on the exact spot a gold bar was, it seemed too far-fetched.Da 5 bloods is an interesting story, riddled with political messages but the themes don't resonate through as strongly as they should've and the ending scenes seemed disjointed from the rest of the film. It's an interesting watch, something that has to be felt instead of understood.",Da 5 Bloods
365,andreipisces,Fairly decent story with great acting and an incredible soundtrack.,5,10 September 2020,"Spike's new joint doesn't have that great of a story. While it does offer a few interesting situations for the gold hunting 'Nam vets, it's nothing that stands out from the hundreds of films on the topic. To make it worse, at various points, it drags for quite a while. It is full of political ""preaching"", and that is not that big of a problem. It's as expected from Spike Lee's style of filmmaking. However, the final scenes seen to have been added after the movie was done.Another problem is the casting, that has severe age-matching problems. The vietnamese girlfriend of one of the characters should be much older, as should her daughter. And Lee might have had his artistic reasons for using the aged actors for the flashbacks, but I sincerely cannot understand it. Casting younger people for these parts or de-aging them through computer effects would have been a better decision.In its defense, he soundtrack, counting with various Marvin Gaye songs, is an absolute delight. And so is the acting, especially by Delroy Lindo, who goes on a especially great monologue while walking through the jungle, and a magnificent portrayal of PTSD. Chadwick Boseman gives an emotional performance. May the sequence with Lindo offering forgiveness be pointed out as one of the best in the whole film. The cinematography is also good, and the creativity with the aspect ratios for the flashbacks was quite good.Overall, it's a film with good visuals and great performances, but with a fairly weak story and some casting issues.",Da 5 Bloods

The colour palette and the soundtrack are already picked out for you, so to create a nuanced film of this calibre in this day and age is all in the substance.

You wont be disappointed as this movie stabs at everything from World War 2 over Vietnam to current conflicts. All wrapped up in a classic adventure to recover a treasure left behind by 5 afroamericans during rhe Vietnam war.Executiinwise the movie varies from promising and emotionally gripping to losing credibility. Especially poor visual effects and a handfull of scenes deflate an otherwise well performed story. When executing a story with such politically laden messages the ocassional drops in quality hurt both credibility and viewer buy-in. Especially those fæashback scenes deserved better colorgrading and intensity to fully grasp the viewer.While you will spot and curse over the annoying poor visual effects and ocasionally flawed scenes you will love the mixed photage, cropping, cuts and colorgrading.

Such is the ambition and sheer free wheeling nature of the script it was only going to soar or plummet to earth. Sadly it's very much the latter. That a bona fide colossus of film making like Spike Lee can get something so wrong is remarkable. This guy has made some absolutely fantastic films and I'm a huge fan of much of his back catalogue. Also the fact he is not long off Black KKKlansman, one of the sharpest, wittiest films of the last ten years makes this hot mess even more surprising.I don't have the time or patience to list off all that's wrong with it. My fingers are cramped from watching much of the film through them. The redeeming qualities are some cast members perform well albeit seemingly in different films. The score is good and there are some interesting nods to how nam was for black soldiers. These only serve to remind you how much of a disservice the rest of the film is though as it meanders between self indulgent and flabby, almost TV drama.Hopefully we can see a great film about the black experience in Vietnam as there is definitely some fertile dramatic ground that other nam films haven't touched.

The strangest thing thing and very distracting for me were the flashbacks and how they used the same actors with no attempt to make them look any younger.

376,Calaverasgrande,"Great message, poor execution. We needed this at this time.",4,14 June 2020,"This movie had a lot of potential. Both in the story to tell about black men's experience in Vietnam. And also the systemic racism in their home country of America.
The movie fails pretty badly.
There are a lot of great poetic juxtapositions of the story against historical events and statements by historical people like Rev.Dr Martin Luther King jr, Angela Davis etc. But there is an in ability of the editor (or the director leaning over the editors shoulder) to cut a scene when it has told it's story. Many scenes run minutes past when they should have concluded. One scene towards the end runs about 10 minutes past when it should have wrapped up and gotten out of the way!
There are also a few problems with the plot that are hard to ignore. Character motivations and behavior just do not make sense.
Also, I have to say this is not the first movie by Spike Lee where the non-black characters are reduced to cartoonish stereotypes. It's odd because elsehwhere in the film Spike goes to pains to show the famous quote by Muhammad Ali about Vietnam, and have his characters repeat words to the same effect multiple times. That VIetnamese and Black people have more in common than not.
Yet the Vietnamese characters in this movie are at the least mildy stereotyped. At the worst, played for cheap laughs.
Then there is the ending. I will not spoil the ending except to say, be prepared. The movie ends about 10 times in a row. Just stay in your seat until the credits roll. It will trick you!
I think Spike operated under the mistaken assumption that this being a straight to Netflix release meant he did not have to worry about running length. In a normal release they may worry that a running length longer than normal reduces the number of possible screenings a day. So it will be harder to recoup investment.
Of course watching at home on Netflix, we are all conditioned to expect 45-50 minutes of entertainment. Stretches longer than that have us longing for the pint in the icebox.Basically I find it hard to imagine this is the same director of She's Gotta have it, Do the Right Thing, and Clockers.

Not just the American side but the Vietnamese too and what was happening in America at the time also. Basically all that gets left to one side and is undermined by the really odd soulless story and the ultra gore towards the end. These guys life long buddies are blowing up and they don't hardly seem to blink. Grown up daughters are discovered and the guy just goes home and doesn't really do anything.

381,Jimmycakes,Slow start and very preachy but it grew on me,5,13 June 2020,"I'm expecting to be preached to since it's Spike Lee but wasn't prepared in the bluntness of the messaging, I almost felt like I was being told I'm too stupid to know that African people have achieved things. Despite that it does work but it sets the tone of the film early on and gives it a comedic/less serious vibe and since I was expecting something deeper and more centered around the conflict perhaps it disappointed me in that respect. Once I got in to the rhythm of the movie I could accept it for what it is.Overall I think it's a missed opportunity to show a deeper Vietnam war story and get the audience to understand further about what it was like to be an African-American in Vietnam during the 1960s. The action scenes are very comedic and Hollywood-esqe so there's no tension there. Chadwick Boseman is excellent and I wanted to see more of him, but his role is very much a cameo, I reckon if the movie had been more serious the audience could have really related and felt for that character. Delroy Lindo is incredible in this too, but again I wanted to see more of the two character's relationships that formed during the war to really feel and understand them. I had hoped the search for gold would be a sub plot to bring the veterans back to Vietnam but actually it's the focus of the movie with Vietnam as a sideshow/after thought.The artwork, soundtrack, and message of the film makes me yearn for what could have been, a deep look in to the Vietnam war by a director that can tell these types of stories in a hard hitting way but it came across almost as a comedy with serious bits thrown in that I can't make sense of.I don't agree with the ""black lives matter"" sloganeering at the end of the film either, I think if other races did that it would be unacceptable and it also places Africans in the predisposition of victim hood, of being in chains from the very start no matter what they do or who they are, of never shaking off their past and it enables other races to start their own similar groups. The movie also paints the picture, and many will believe this to be true as a result, of African-Americans being used as cannon fodder in Vietnam when in reality it was a class-based prejudice, a lot of poor white people died in that war at no choice of their own and just because they have the same skin complexion as the people running the war that doesn't make them the same people, they probably had more in common with the African-American they were dying beside.",Da 5 Bloods
382,KinoCynic,"Upon reflection, disingenuous and insensitive",1,19 July 2021,"I watched this last year when it came out and thought it was a mess, but ultimately just fine. As a Spike Lee movie, I expected a strong, blatant message and this film definitely has that.The message however, is pretty insensitive.The film opens with REAL footage of executions and war crimes committed in Vietnam. Dead children with bullet holes in their heads, point blank executions, which are completely at odds with the silly way the film emulates old war movies where American GIs mow down sneaky Vietnamese guerrilla fighters. The film has a bad sense of humour - there's a scene where a veteran gets his legs blown off and dies screaming, then fives minutes later the characters are quipping before a big shootout against mercenaries who probably wanted nothing to do with these people anyway, I don't remember. It feels exploitative to put those who actually suffered alongside Marvel-style silliness like this.Politics in Spike Lee movies is inevitable. But the politics of this movie are dodgy at best and offensive at worst. Spike Lee uses the backdrop of the Vietnam war, where mostly underprivileged and uneducated teenagers and young men were forced to fight and developed PTSD, and the Vietnamese had their homes destroyed, children burned and mutated and killed horrifically, to push contemporary politics which are irrelevant in comparison. BlacKKKlansman has a great ending which ties the themes of the film to real life racial tensions in America, and encourages the audience to consider what's going on in American society.Da 5 Bloods has an ending where the characters donate their treasure to the Black Lives Matter organisation. This poses no thoughts or ideas, but comes across as Spike Lee basically saying 'donate to this organisation'. It feels very disingenuous to use the backdrop of a complex and horrible war to campaign for an American organisation, regardless of your opinion on BLM.In summary, please don't use real life atrocities to promote an organisation that has nothing to do with the Vietnam war.",Da 5 Bloods

I'm not ignoring the fact that a now 60 year old Lee is a reliably provocative film-maker, who still has his finger on the pulse of modern America, but I am watching outside of those obvious political threads.What I see when I follow Lee's four African American vets, who battle the forces of man and nature when they return to Vietnam to seek the remains of their fallen squad leader and the gold fortune he helped them hide, is a visual testament (and slapdown) to the human memory.Inbetween that, the unequal tonal shifts sometimes made me think Lee wasn't sure if this Netflix fare needed to be an action moview with something to say, or a political movie with some action thrown in along the way. However, at its conclusion it made me think that the one real equalizer in life, the frailties and falsehoods of human memory is what unltimately unites us and divides us, time and time again.",Da 5 Bloods

The interweaving of 60's -70s civil rights movement and Vietnam to what's going on now in 2020 is seamless.

393,ValdSB,Too long,6,30 June 2020,"This movie could have been 90 minutes. But it is overlong, due to the fact that Spike Lee fills up the movie with documentary style cuts, focusing on racism in America. But it just feels so out of touch with the overall arc of the story, which is actually very promising. I dont think that the racism-stuff should have left behind, but i think it would have worked a lot better, if they just toned it down a nutch, without jumping around. With that said, the second half of the movie is very good. Delroy Lindo is amazing, his scenes alone in the jungle are awesome. The final showdown is also very rewarding. But its just the first half that ruins the movie. More than one hour has passed, before something actually happens. And i think a lot of viewers will turn away in that time. I almost did so myself. 2hours and 45 minutes is crazy given a plot, that is very thin, and filled up with out-of-place stuff, that just contributes to lose the overall focus of the movie.

Yes it has a particular political slant that you will already know.And yes, for sure, it does tell the story with a black man's lens, and Good say I. Why did so many black US soldiers die in Nam? Why do so many black health workers die fighting Covid19? Same answer, racism. No not some high-blown theory of the superiority of one race over another (well, other than the white race over the yellow people anyway), but a casual everyday tale of survival in which the in-group use their defacto control - without even thinking - so as to have the effect of pushing the marginal elements to the front rank to take the big risks and to be unable to push pack.So in the sense of that narrative there's nothing confusing about this film at all: its central thread is the unbroken theme that black lives haven't mattered much to white people, but frankly Lee throws up so much chaff - and so much humorous diversion and hunt-the-homage excursion - that the idea is scarcely in your face at all, despite what so many amateur critics have written here. I loved the several diverse cameo sub-plots about the effects of age, of difficult relationships with children, of a continuing French dimension in Indo Chine, of Vietnamese ambivalence to returning GIs, of the roles and tensions in exchanges between local and tourist, of American ignorance about Europeans, and so much more.Neither did it bother me that the ages of the generations didn't fit with the technology incidentals (the present date is never clear). Nor did I find the flashback scenes with the OAPs playing themselves in 1970 wrong: it is to me a novel and effective device that the survivors age but the dead stay young (for they shall grow not old....). It worked for me. And I loved it that Ali and Luther King and others popped up in newsreels making just the right observations.But if you come expecting a linear narrative, a slick and authentic war story, or a mainstream movie that won't rub your face in white privilege ... move on.",Da 5 Bloods

I saw this film front and center as a Spike Film and I was like I'm not ready to hear what he has to say. I personally didn't like Blacklansman. I literally saw a Facebook post about it and I was like hell... what do I have to loose. I heated up some food and I sat down to watch it. I expected typical Spike.So immediately my vision had to calibrate it's self because it felt weird seeing black men talk about being Vietnam vets. I always see white dudes doing that in film. So that felt off... BUT I know these men exist because I meet them a lot. My late step father was one! Anyways that was that. So I fixed my eyes and equipped myself for a Spike joint. So my heart was so warm by seeing the men in present day Vietnam. We don't see black older men with this back drop. Period. So then he starts connecting the storylines... you have all the well developed characters. I love how we're taking into each man's story a bit. So in the beginning it's a lot of backstory goodness.AND the IT gets real when they finalize matters and trek it. Initially, I was like hey I don't want to see them get killed. But the way Spike poetically correlates their demise with real world reality for the black vet was SPOT on! I got chills.And like how the PSTD was so real. I was on the edge all during the end.Delroy deserves an Academy award for his performance. And Spike omg... brother I've been sleeping on you.These idiots that gave reviews have no clue about the voice that you gave for BLACK vets! Like there will be dialogue and dialogue from this film.

For the commentary and how the film explores racial issues regarding to veterans in particular, I give da 5 Bloods a 10/10. My problems with this film are more minor but still bugged me . The cinematography did not feel confident throughout the whole film . Some shots look great with a distinct style and vision and some shots just feel lazy. For the most part I actually enjoyed the way the plot turns out. It does feel a little Tarantino esc at times but thats a good thing. Some of the minor characters that appear in the film really bug me and I don't understand their purpose. They gave good performances but just they're presence in the film hurts the tone and kind of took me out . Their parts of the film doesn't have much relevance and I would say a good 20 minutes couldve been chopped out of the film.
Overall it's still a great movie 👌 Like always spike lee dives deeper into civil issues than you can find from almost any Hollywood director.

420,celinka20,"Quite Artsy, Alright Until Halfway Through",7,26 September 2020,"There were some aspects of film-making that I found quite appealing. But this is a film made by an black director for a black audience. Just like so many other films about the Vietnam War are films made by a white director for a white audience.First, the artistry of the film. I liked how the movie ""framed"" of the two narratives, past and present. The 4:3 screen was used to portray the flashbacks, a visual metaphor for ""footage"" from the past. Present-day events are show in the widescreen.Another aspect I really liked was having the older actors portray the younger versions of themselves. Most other movies would have casted younger actors in those roles, but then that might have caused confusion for the audience in having to figure out who is who in their younger versions. What I liked about having the older actors act alongside Chadwick Boseman was the fact that it created a visual contrast. I got to see how they all got along with one another. In a way, it was almost like an endearing journey to the past to help retell the story of their leader.This is also an important film because it gives voice to a visible minority group who fought in the war, but are so often left out of the storytelling when it comes to movies about the Vietnam War.The story was quite compelling and moving up until the point when they found the gold. Like some other reviewers here have said, the Tarantino-style (dark comedy) violence did not seem consistent with the rest of the tone of the film, which started out as a touching story about camaraderie, loyalty and redemption.It was also disconcerting to see the Vietnamese characters portrayed so superficially in a film about dehumanization as a result of racism. None of the Vietnamese characters had any depth. More importantly, there didn't seem to be any effort on the part of the writers or the director to portray any complexity in the Vietnamese characters, or the events and the issues of the war.For example, the narrative of Tien-Otis was terribly simplified and romanticized. Here is a woman who worked as a prostitute, who birthed a child of mixed American-Vietnamese heritage, who, along wth her daughter, suffered from years of ostracization, vilification, and condemnation by their compatriots. And yet, Otis appears and he finds that she's become super rich, and life is good, and she and Michon are both perfectly well-adjusted. Huh?! No resentment at all? No sense of abandonment at all? No anger whatsoever? This is totally unrealistic. And it's a big missed opportunity from a storytelling point of view.Another example is of Vinh and Quan. One is the silent helper who later benefits from the work that the veterans did to recover the gold. This is where instead of the white saviour, you have a black saviour. And then for Quan, he and his henchmen reminded me of how African actors are portrayed in Hollywood films as crazed, violent and senseless murderers. Here, substitute them with Vietnamese actors. Same diff. This is quite disturbing for a film that is trying to advocate for a marginalized and silence group, and in doing so it subjugates the Vietnamese actors.Finally, Quan is the character who brought up My Lai. That massacre, if anyone cares to research it, was the product of socio-economic inequalities in American society at the time. As well as failures in the American military training program, basically the lack thereof. It is very complex, and the horror experienced by the Vietnamese is barely acknowledged at all, except maybe superficially through archival photos and footage. There is that word again, superficial.For film-making technique, I think Spike Lee did much better than the writers. The script should have been rejected by Mr. Lee.",Da 5 Bloods

The main characters are (mostly) relatable, but the conclusion left me wondering what Lee had hoped I would have taken from the story. Certainly there was the point that America (White America) was horrible to black American soldiers, let alone Vietnam people who are, as always (although apparently not believed by enough people), just normal humans, like us. I would (unfairly) characterize that as the ""Black People Suffering Racism from White America"" theme. But there were other theme/genres that fought to be remembered. Vietnam War biopic. Adventure/Action guy movie. Bad father/Hurt son drama. Documentary on non-American NGO work to clean the mess America made. Boy-girl will-they-won't-they.It was a soup of a Spike Lee Joint.

It just SCREAMS out that this is poorly written, poorly directed, from an average script. What a terrible movie. I know MOST of the areas in Asia where the film was shot, been there, seen them, even live near a few of them, but the way its shot is just awful. The real locations without Spike Lee filming them are far more beautiful, -- Lee either doesn't have the talent to know how to shoot the scene, or he made these areas look awful by choice. I'm surprised the locals on this movie allowed themselves to be used -- but it was extremely likely that they had NO idea who this man is and didn't care -- it was a ""Netflix"" movie so they jumped on it. Some of these scenes look like bad sets populated with bad actors, yet I know these areas where he shot and somehow he made a the real places look like Steven Seagal ran out of money during filming of ""Untitled Movie #129"".

447,jeppeaandreasen,Awkward issues arises when simple Spike Lees simple brand of storytelling is used on a global stage,5,14 June 2020,"This is an opinion piece, I realise that some movies and opinions accompanying these - are often judged in the context of American identity politics. As I am uninterested in these matters, i will try to judge this movie on its merits and only refer to political issues when they are included in the movie itself.Those of you familiar with Spike Lee will know exactly to expect - subtlety, depth and nuance is not part of Lees storytelling arsenal.Instead he opts for a very simple and effective emotional way of telling his stories. His protagonist are, for the most part, poor oppressed victims while his antagonist are one-dimensional bigoted ignoramuses.Lees movies aims to tell you what to feel and when to feel, by pitting 2 visually very diffrent groups against each other. Like Camerons Avatar (2009) or most of the formulaic 90s sports movies, the audience are never trusted to do any interpretation on their own and the bad guys are never given any motivation, beyond being evil for the sake of being evil.I was very excited when I heard that Spike Lee was to make a film set in Vietnam, following a group of American vets and that the film was to be presented to an international audience on a global streaming service.Would this well established director have a diffrent approach when telling a story set on an international stage presented to an international audience. Or would he stick to his simple brand og good vs bad story-telling. Train-wreck or masterpiece I was in for a uniquely entertaining experience - or so i hoped.I was excited to see :1) If Lee would depict an occupation force, who executed, raped and burned the population alive - as the good guys. A tough sell regardless of the pigmentation of your main characters.2) Would the countless factions involved in the conflict be depicted with any nuance. A tough task for a filmmaker who usually equates physical features with motivation and character traits.3) Who will the antagonists be - and will they have any motivation beyond loving money and hating the disenfranchised.4) Would Lee be able to keep his on the nose comments on the current political landscape in America distract on a level where they weren't distracting.A great scene involving one of the main characters (Paul, brilliantly played by Delroy Lindo) is confronted by a local man and his agressive sales tactic in one of Vietnams floating markets.As the salesman gets more intrusive, Pauls demeanour changes to the point where gets up and screams a derogatory term used during the war, at the salesman.The salesman recognise the term and recognise Paul as a G.I. The scene explodes when pinned up rage is released, the scene is incredible well acted, well constructed and thoroughly informed by the characters and the war they are both haunted by.For the rest of the movie most Vietnamese are depicted as a faceless mob for our protagonists to mow down in a glorious Michael Bay-like glowing CGI-blood carnage.Later on we are told how that Pauls rage and frustration is caused, not by the atrocities done to the Vietnamese, but by him accidentally shooting a squad-mate during the war. The guilt of this is he's motivation for returning to Vietnam, he seemingly want his fallen friend to have a proper burial back in America.This motivation changes suddenly and without any explanation. And his motivation aligns with the rest of the main characters. Go back to Vietnam to retrieve a cache of gold for themselves, gold ment to pay the wages of their allied Vietnamese soldiers.Beyond the faceless Vietnamese mowed down in flashbacks to the wa -r and at the movies climax. The main antagonist is a double-crossing, moustache twirling, Luger-carrying cartoon villain.Finally a bit about Spike Lees political stuff. As I have no horse in the race, when it comes to American identity politics, I would normally refrain from commenting on this.But as this is a Spike Lee movie, I find it impossible to review the movie without mentioning it.To be clear, i much prefer the transparency of Lee´s on the nose commentary to the way soulless marketingteams, try to sell horrible lazy remakes by slapping on some trivial social justice message, after the fact.But some of the things introduced here is a little jarring. Lee introduces a MAGA-hat early in the movie, anyone wearing the hat is brutally gunned down in a sea of red glowing CGI-blood.There seems to be no consistant traits or ideology between the men wearing the hat.The movies big cathartic moment is meant to be when our surviving protagonists smuggels the money out of Vietnam, and make a huge donation to the organisation Black Lives Matter. And what might to be a fictional french-owned minesweeper NGO.The sequence concludes with a videoclip of Dr. Martin Luther King, and a crawl with information on his murder.Some people might think that equating Dr. Kings peaceful movement with the BLM organisations activities is poor taste.My conclusion is this, Spike Lees brand of simple moviemaking does not translate well to more nuanced settings and stories. One or to characters get enough screentime to be interesting - as a result of their strong acting-performances not the writing.Most of the characters very hard to care about, as they are one-dimensional and have seemingly no motivation for their actions, beyond money.A few interesting ideas are introduced, but are quickly abandoned.Introducing a reallife organisation and suggesting that stealing money to fund their activities, feels problematic. Equating BLM with the peaceful work of Dr. Martin Luther King, feels like a misrepresentation of his movement.Spike Lee still have an original voice, that alone makes this movie more entertaining than most of the sequels, prequels, soft reboots, genderswap reboots and generally bland entertainment released by Hollywood these years.Strong performances elevate the material. But with its myriad of issues I fear this title will be forgotten as soon as Netflix remove the title from their slider.",Da 5 Bloods
448,PopeyeTheSailor,Poorly-writtena adventure film masquerading as a war movie with a message,2,14 June 2020,"I got just over an hour into the movie before I had to turn it off due to the quality. This is a truly awful movie, and I have reached the point i have to question my own Spike Lee fandom. Everything he's done since Oldboy has been very bad, with the sole exception of maybe Blackkklansman which I thought was average.This is his second worst film, only being outdone by the unwatchable ""Da Sweet Blood of Jesus."" (Similar titles ironically) And yet, his self-referencing that was cringe in the early 2010s is still ever-present. We get it. You're from Brooklyn, you went to Morehouse, you think Trump is the worst president ever... And yet you're still making these same points in a damn VIETNAM WAR movie without any care in the world about the quality of the story, characters, pacing, or acting. There wasn't a single redeeming quality of the movie. It was certainly the worst edited movie I've come across in awhile... I don't know what Spike Lee was thinking with the intermittent Ken Burns-style b-roll of history, but it was extremely corny and unnecessary.I'm done with Spike. He's lost in his own ego at this point and a bunch of clueless liberal critics will just keep inflating it. Oldboy, Da Sweet Blood of Jesus, Red Hook Summer, Chiraq, the She's Gotta Have It series... And now Da 5 Bloods. I believe the strength of 1990s and 80s work was in his cast but either way, I'm certainly not wasting another minute with this type of cheesy nonsense.

Or that it's forcing us a black agenda. Or that this movie is made to put white people in a bad spotlight. Or that veterans suffering from PTSD wouldn't act this way in a million years. Or that it's a bad war movie. Or that it didn't have a message. There was even a review that said that this movie was made to disgrace Trump. Like wtf...Every director has it's own style. Look at Nolan or Tarantino. And this movie shows us the style of Spike Lee.This movie isn't forcing us a black agenda. It shows us the perspective of black men going on a journey.This movie doesn't put white people in a bad spotlight. It showed us the treatment of white people (not all white people) and how it affected the Bloods. Some people are blind to see that this was normal back in the day, to treat black men like they were worthless.Veterans suffering from PTSD experience it different than another. I know this to be fact because I know a lot of vets suffering from this (volunteerd to help & support veterans).Just because this movie has war elements in it doesn't mean that it's a war movie. This movie is about something else.Not every movie is made with the purpose to share their message. And some movies you just don't realize the message because you can't relate.And also the movie didn't disgrace Trump in any way. Ok they said he was a bad president, but that was the opinions from the characters in a conversation, if you have ever been in a conversation you know that not everybody has the same opinion. But lets be honest the movie didn't need to put dirt on Trump's name, he does that himself.Overall a great movie. Don't let the salty people influence you of not watching this movie.

Spike Lee crushed it with his most recent directed project; his choice of stylization, his handling of the story and characters, his implementation of his chosen message - all are used with spectacular results, and I couldn't envision a better way to execute these aspects. Acting is impeccable in this film, especially from Delroy Lindo; every character depicted feels like their own, distinct person, and could have carried the movie on their own. With an amazing latter finale, the first half hour is a bit heavy on exposition; however, that could be excused given that it makes the audience more attached with the main four characters who are portrayed as Black Vietnam War veterans who have been rejected by society.

From everything I know, its fairly accurate and shows well what they went through. Also, the portrayal of the different levels of PTSD that the vets still have and go through is very well shown.The bad in this case is the length of the movie. It drags in places and could have used some editing to help with pacing and storytelling. It never drags enough to break suspension of disbelief, at least it didnt for me, but it definitely could have been a little faster paced in parts.Overall, this is a good movie.

And the device of using the old actors during the flashback scenes with a younger actor is a foolish device that stops the film every time it is employed. This isn't a film, so much as a polemic about race. I get it, and I agree, but who wants to be hit over the head with his ideology for 2.5 hours?",Da 5 Bloods

Major plot holes and dialogue that lacked any kind of reason. Then some random 4th wall talkin to the camera just because they could.

I am happy to report that this movie isn't one of them.The movie was fantastically filmed and is easy on the eyes in that aspect.Delroy Lindo steals the show and is by far the best actor in the movie. His character is a complex one, and only a splendid performance could pull him off. Delroy Lindo transforms this movie to a good one from an OK one.I would have loved to see them do some de-aging of the characters when they were in Vietnam, but, alas, they didn't have the funding to do so.The movie is, in totality, a great watch, but a tad too long, in my opinion.",Da 5 Bloods

491,miriamzora,Horrible,2,20 August 2020,"This movie is laughably bad. At times it seemed like I was watching a B-movie (example: dude gets blown in half by a landmine and is yelling and somehow still conscious? No). I really like a lot of Spike Lee flicks and this one sounded like it was going to be cool, but was just so so bad- the script, acting, story, etc. I'm wondering if it was rushed because of COVID and BLM protests because it's hard to believe Lee would let this one out into the public. The only good parts were the real-life footage.
Some things read like budget issues disguised/passed-off as stylistic choice. The war scenes were so unrealistic and problematic even for a fantasy-dreamlike-memory. Actor soliloquies didn't work at all and the whole MAGA theme was very forced. A lot of the violence was random, unnecessary and poorly executed like a bad action flick. It literally had us laughing out loud in moments that were supposed to be serious. Reminded me more of Tropic Thunder than a serious film about the scars of war.
Also, did any of the Americans involved actually spend any real time in Vietnam? The landmarks used are recognizable places in Thailand which seems like a weird choice given that it's a completely different place. Vietnam is a really amazing country which could have been explored more if at all since it's so central in the film. Instead, this movie makes it look like present day Vietnam is about 10 miles long (because everyone keeps running into each other everywhere) with dangerous machine gun wielding men wandering around the jungle.
The fact that it has glowing reviews is mind-boggling and just tells me that critics are using herd mentality politics instead of actual critical thinking.",Da 5 Bloods

The acting is pretty good and there's a half decent story in there - the problem is that both these things are completely swamped by incoherent political ramblings and a jarring over-stylised narrative.Da 5 Bloods represents all of the excesses that Spike Lee needs to rein in.

Kind of felt dated in that respect.I watched this on a Friday night, paused halfway through, and when I woke Saturday Chadwick Boseman had passed away. He's given some great performances.

503,Cineology,Only Spike Lee Could Have Made This,9,30 June 2020,"The kind of movies I look for are the ones that inspire my being to pause somewhere amidst the curious happenings and force me to think, ""Spielberg made this,"" ""Tarantino made this,"" or ""Herzog made this."" In the middle of this purposeful, angry, at times moving and educational picture, I couldn't help but think, ""Spike Lee was the only person who could have made this"" because the work possesses so much flavor and personality, the experience leaps out of the screen to slap us and shake us; it is alive, humorous, tragic, ironic, and timely.It goes beyond politics. There are jabs against Donald Trump, his presidency, and his racist remarks (and actions) against African-Americans and other minorities, but the screenplay by Lee, Danny Bilson, Paul De Neo, and Kevin Willmott is correct to treat it as a symptom of the malignant tumor that has been wreaking havoc within the veins of US of A since its inception. The plot revolves around four Vietnam war veterans who return to the country that, for better or worse, have shaped who they are. They wish to retrieve a case full of gold. But this being a Spike Lee Joint, this shiny thing is metaphor: of ghosts, of corrupted souls, of what has been stolen or denied by a country that used, abused, and sold slaves so it could become what it is-a world leader, a superpower, a bully, a mess... yet somehow still regarded as an ideal by most nations. It is a story, too, about contradiction and hypocrisy.But foremost: it is a story about forgiveness. It doesn't seem at that way even already an hour into the picture. I admired that about it. Spanning about a hundred and fifty minutes, it takes its time to allow the pieces to fall into place. It invites us to look beyond the action and consider our world. It implores us to really look at it, to ask ourselves if we're proud of it, if we feel comfortable for children to live and thrive in it. So many mainstream movies these days, many of which are forgettable, settle for shallow entertainment. Nothing at all to say about the world around us, our history, where we're heading. As it has always been with Lee: To be political, to voice out injustice, to act as a megaphone is entertainment. He doesn't want us to turn off our brains; he wants us to turn it on, to push it, to challenge the system of oppression.We meet Eddie the businessman who exudes success (Norm Lewis), Otis who left someone important in Vietnam (Clarke Peters), Melvin the conscience and pragmatist (Isiah Whitlock Jr.), and Paul the wild card (Delroy Lindo). We hang out with these men as they laugh, drink, and reminisce. The writer-director shows them looking at the Vietnamese and the Vietnamese looking at them. The camera pinpoints skin color, physical stature, hair, voice, how a person carries himself or herself within a defined space. It is an observant picture, certainly daring and willing to ignite fierce discussion. There is not one shot that comes across as a waste.But how can there be forgiveness, healing, when so much injustice and anger remain? The film does not provide answers, but it presents a microcosm in the form of Paul mourning over a dear friend-someone he looks up to, one whom he considers to be a brother-whose name was Stormin' Norman (Chadwick Boseman). Notice the technique used during its flashbacks: Norman is shown as an ideal. A case can be made that we never truly get to know him as he was, only in the mind of Paul-the man whose body got to go home to America but whose soul remained in Vietnam alongside the corpse of his friend. Paul is such a shell, he finds he is incapable of loving his own son (Jonathan Majors). David looks at his father and he seems lost. They are tethered only by genetics. It is a sad sight to see and feel. Wonderfully performed by Lindo, Paul is one of the most memorable characters I've come across in recent memory.Does the movie provide catharsis? Yes and no. There is catharsis on screen which involves shootouts, deaths (black, white, American, Vietnamese, French), and tying up loose ends by showing signed checks, hugging, solidarity, and people shouting ""Black Lives Matter!"" Perhaps I don't feel there is true catharsis because I am a person of color in America. That when I go to the Midwest, for example, I am not seen as an American but The Other. A second-class citizen. But sometimes it is enough that a film takes a shovel, dig deep, and further expose what has long been dormant. Or at the very least serving as reminder of what we have yet to work on.",Da 5 Bloods

The story line sounded so unrealistic from the start that I expected it to be fun, a spoof. But no, he means it. It's overwrought, indulgent, full of facile cliches, from easy shots at the French to ambiguous and unflattering display of Asians. No cross cultural insight whatsoever either - he manages to make a movie where you ultimately don't root for the black protagonists which in many ways are victims, because they just seem to be your quintessential, self-centered ... Americans. Of any color. Yes, that too is an unfair cliche. But this movie is just that unaware of its own terrible biases. Between the unrealistic plot lines and pathos, and with no single character whose actions or motivations I can follow, it is also incredibly boring. 2 1/2 h of my life wasted on a movie where I got no feelings at all. Not even horror or disgust at war. Oh, and the soundtrack? Like out of some old Western, or revolutionary movie - the pathos is dripping from the ceiling in the most unexpected scenes. It is just amazingly bad. Someone better walk up to Spike Lee and tells him that not everything he wants to say is important, good... or even makes sense.",Da 5 Bloods
506,morefaster,Black lives matter so this movie must be important,2,13 June 2020,"I watched Da5Bloods based soley on the accolades it's received from a few major publications, and while I appreciate the relevancy it holds to the current racial climate, I don't think it's very cool to laud a bad movie just because of said relevancy. If this movie had a white director at the helm, with a white cast, it would have been panned and forgotten. It's just that bad.Other reviews will go into details on the inconsistencies and errors within the film, but all that stuff aside, what I found most unnerving is that these major publications blatantly discarded any attempt at an honest critique, just to conciliate a particular demographic, i.e. black people! So not only are we scared to admit that Da5Bloods is a gargantuan trainwreck of a film, but we'll ignore all faults altogether, just to avoid any uneasy racial turbulence. Sure, why not. Who cares.So yeah, IMO most of Spike Lee's movies suck, and Da5Bloods is no exception. It's sloppy, poorly written, derivative, and badly executed. Not much more to say. If you're looking for a good American war-time gold heist film, Kellys Heroes or 3Kings are much better movies.If you want to watch an artful and challenging film by a black filmmaker, then Steve Mcqueen is your guy.

514,hrishikeshbade,da 5 blood review,5,12 June 2020,"In Spike Lee's latest instalment we follow 4 Vietnam War veterans on a quest to retrieve the gold they had hidden and stored away during the war. This film is filled with an incredibly talented cast and a very powerful social message.
This movie explores the effects war on the African-American soldiers , the racial injustice they suffer, the sacrifice they made for the country that they Want to believe in, for equality and the brotherly bond they have formed because of the war.
The cast does an absolutely excellent job with the material they're provided with, Spike Lee explores Vietnam in a very interesting way, we are shown the old as well as modern Vietnam and how it has risen above the adverse effects of war.
The movie makes a point to show the important and prominent figures of the black community and their achievement and the effects America had on Vietnam, we are shown pictures from the past of ppl injured, killed, and tortured in the war. The movie also showcases the psychological effects of war on the soldiers , they suffer from depression, PTSD, anxiety which is showcased with really good acting.
The very powerful cast consisting of Chadwick Boseman(Norman), Delroy Lindo(Paul), and Jean Reno along with many others show very compelling characters and act very well, the action scenes are decent enough and the actors try their best , we jump back and forth a lot and the older characters don't seem young in the past scenes convincingly, also there is very little shown of Chadwick Boseman around 10 mins perhaps or 15 mins of the runtime.
The film does drag a little near the end with an unclear motive, where a certain decision is made which is odd. However this movie is decent and achieves what it aims for, it is very powerful with its message on black communities and the effects of war and racial discrimination.

515,mwescapists,Spike Lee with another miss...,2,17 July 2020,"Another subject Spike should of nailed and didn't. First, Chiraq, now this...I was pretty excited to see this film, but after viewing it, I was pretty disappointed. Though the film is very well shot (the cinematography is very well done), there are numerous issues that just makes the movie clumsy and even lazy at points.The GoodCinematography is well done, there are a few shots in this film worth pausing the actual movie for and taking in. Also, the flashback scenes are so well shot, they actually look almost identical to the legit footage mixed in through out the film.The BadThin Characters, outside of Delroy Lindo, this was both a misuse and underuse of talent. The characters, outside of Lindo, had no arch and kind of just existed. Any revelations were through dialogue and fell flat. Lindo's character is the only one that has a full arch.Poor music choices, there was this intense gun fight during a flashback, and the music that played over it completely pulled me out of the scene. The music was a complete mismatch to the gun fight on screen. Also, the use of Flight Of The Valkyries when the boat pulled away from shore...I scoffed at this. I get the reference to Apocalypse Now, but this just didn't hit for me. Some of the song choices (outside of Marvin Gaye) left me scratching my head.Main cast was the same age fifty years ago they are today. Now, I was hoping there was a reason for this, so I reserved my judgement. There was no reason for this other than no one, NO ONE, saying ""Uh, Spike...I don't think a 60-70 year old man would look the same as their 20 year old self."" This was such a major oversight, that it made Spike come off as amateur. Then, at the end of the film, there's a photo of the five, and the cast is made up to look younger! Why didn't you use them in make up for the flash backs?!Art Design, this film doesn't look like a Spike Lee film. Other than the title, his usual style isn't present here. This is more of a personal knock, as I'm a fan of his art direction.I could go on...the Vietnamese actor near the end coming off as slightly goofy instead of justifiably angry, telling instead of showing, Chadwick being horribly underused, etc. There was a possibly reference to the movie Dead Presidents' Vietnam sequence, but won't spoil it.I can't recommend it.

520,ReadingMovies,This movie could have said so much more.,7,25 June 2020,"A group of Vietnam veterans (Bloods) go back to the jungle to retrieve a cargo of gold, that they had secured during the Vietnam war. They are also there to retrieve the remaining of Norman, a lost member of the Bloods, to give him a proper resting place back home. Conflict arises when a group of Vietnamese gunmen find out about the gold.The fact that i can write the synopsis without the word ""racism"" bothers me. It feels like Spike Lee's social commentary was added in, after the script was already written. This doesn't make the commentary less true, it just feels less connected to the narrative and the central conflict. It feels like the social commentary can be stripped from the movie and you would still have a simple action story that works. About Vietnam veterans going years later back to the ""dangerous"" jungles of Vietnam. That said I think it's an important message and something that is not talked about a lot, I myself was not aware of the racism that took place during the Vietnam war. Racism, a problem that is still present all over the world and especially in the USA. I just wished the movie showed more of the racial inequalities during the Vietnam war, instead of only talking about them.Spike Lee is not someone who shies away of making his point clear and being direct. One example of this is the real life imagery of the Vietnam war, this made me think. Is it morally wrong to use real imagery of the war, in a film that is more concerned with telling a generic action story instead of telling a realistic story. A realistic story about the horrible things that happened there and the innocent lives that were lost. To be clear, I have no problems with graphical imagery as long as it serves a purpose, like in a documentary. Here the imagery only seems to function as shock value, it has no function in the overall narrative. It is not connected to the central conflict in any way. We don't get context so it's not really informative. Where ""Do The Right Things"" felt like one coherent movie because its themes and social commentary were concerning the central conflict of the movie and the final choice of the protagonist, this just feels like an action movie with an important message slapped on. This ""action movie"" feeling is most apprehend in the final shootout scene, it felt a bit over the top for a movie that was trying to say important things. Why is the conflict of the movie, that has a message of anti-violence, resolved with violence. This movie could have said so much more.The movie is technically good. I enjoyed the different aspect ratios for different time periods. I enjoyed the cinematography overall. Acting, editing, sound and mise-en-scène were good, but nothing really standing out.

527,dagnew99,Pretty bad,3,16 February 2021,"I wanted to like this film, but it didn't hang together well, and the plot was a stretch from the beginning. I've never been to VietNam ('tho I've been to Canada). I think it's important that the reality of the horror of that war be told, and I applaud Spike Lee for tackling the task. But this struck me as a largely superficial characterization entirely dependent on a crazy amount of blood & gore to prop up a very dubious plot. Most Americans should see the insane horror of that war, but it's a story which flops as entertainment.",Da 5 Bloods

530,vncntobyrne,Garbage,1,17 June 2020,The acting and storyline in this was really dire. So many plot holes. It was like watching a train wreck over 2.5 hours. Excruciating stuff. The worst entry in celluloid depiction of the Vietnam conflict... spike lee definitely jumped the shark with this one. The trailer seemed so promising but it's just a collection of poorly executed set pieces and the themes important themes are handled in a clunky earnest manner. Don't let this be your legacy Spike.

531,ahshutt,Let down...,2,25 December 2020,"I enjoyed the historical focus on how much the black community has fought and sacrificed for this nation. I know so many incredibly heroic stories of black soldiers, marines, airmen, seamen, but this movie just didn't work for me. *RIP Chadwick Boseman* I just wish this movie worked. They were trying to set up the flashbacks to help set the dialogue, however, it failed miserably. This was due to no character changes, it just shows the men in their late years but dressed up as if they were 18 in war. This would have been okay but they had no fluency between the present and between the past. Characters are killed in a comedic way I had no attachment except for Storming Norman. The rest of the characters didn't really have a moral. There's way too much wrong with this film. I could write a novel about it. The worst part is they could have made this so much better. They've got the right idea but just portrayed it so horrible.. Complete let down.",Da 5 Bloods
532,akdjreview,Longwinded unoriginal storyline,5,13 November 2021,"Didn't come in with many expectations but following a video I saw online, I became intrigued and thought I found a hidden gem. But turns out I did not... The unoriginal Netflix original storyline of a couple of soldiers going on a mission to collect a treasure, which I don't know how many times I've seen at this point. Even so, the storyline was a weird combination of Spike Lee the director trying to connect the Vietnam war with racism which did not turn out that well.Even so, the movie was not a complete flop. It was beautifully shot in the remote parts of Vietnam with an incredible landscape and Lee really uses this to the fullest. Though the scenes were pretty to look at the characters were quite bland. With the exception of Paul the man with severe PTSD following his time in the Vietnam war. Paul's character development throughout the movie is impressive and differentiate from the other characters and to be honest, Paul is the only interesting character at all and he was also the only part of the movie that had a good ending.The idea of showing backlash scenes throughout is good in theory but did not excel here. It could have been good to use the backlash scenes to maybe get to know the characters more or something like that but instead ended up with just showing 10 minutes scenes of shootouts where nothing happened.The movie is also way too long, you could probably remove 1.5h of it and it would probably be an even better movie. And in conclusion, it's a bad movie but not a complete flop. With an incredible unoriginal story, Lee still managed to get something out of it to my surprise. But you probably shouldn't watch it if you have a lot of time on your hands and love long movies.",Da 5 Bloods

In this, the film's themes are stronger than the plot. There are times in the movie when the quest becomes a little too easy in order to service the plot and move the real story forward. This is not a story about a quest for gold and bones; rather, it's a quest for self, reconcilation, and discovering what liberty truly means. It's a story about brotherhood, about fatherhood, and about a nation that many African Americans fought for even though the nation did not fight for them.

538,Aziatik,A bleak Reminder Of What Memory Can Do,8,12 June 2020,"Film Director Spike Lee is back in form behind the camera with another whiplash piece of Cinema. Da 5 blood explores four Black Vietnam veterans back on war soil to retrieve lost gold left by a fallen soldier played by Chadwick Boseman. In this Film, the use of flashback is what stings like a dagger forcing the viewer to ponder about how memory can be an affliction , especially in the context of War. Spike Lee sets the past in the present by having the main characters re-living war memories at their actual old age. This technique puts the emphasis on how war can be a never ending cycle even where the battlefield is absent. Fine acting also helps this movie get his point accross, but man, here, actor Delroy Lindo shines with his portrayal of a war veteran facing his demons. Different themes can be observed in this film, one element that caught my attention is the idea of how humans failed to love. Although Americans usually claim to be God fearing Christians who are buddy with The Christ, love clearly slipped off their hands by throwing themselves into war. The decision by the big wings to go to war was a decision that would mark humanity for ever. The film is well written, has a good score and a fine reminiscing use of music with a brillant use of Marvin Gaye's accapella. Spike also uses tactics of framing and re-framing which puts the viewer in sync with time and perspective.If you love Cinema and respect an acute vision, do not skip this piece of Filmmaking, you will feel the love.",Da 5 Bloods
539,kreams,So unfortunate,1,20 May 2021,"Some of the actors would were 12 years old when the Vietnam war ended. Why did they decide to set the heist in present day? It would have made much more sense to set it in 2010. Why did the characters wait so long to go back? Oh, I think I know the answer... They just wanted to rag on Trump. They make their one black conservative character into a mentally disturbed villain. It could have worked just as well set in 2010 with the one republican bad-mouthing Obama, and the actors would have been believably the age to do the physical things they did.Spike Lee wants to make everything about American politics even at the expense of the Vietnamese. He doesn't even address the fact that the gold they come to get was to pay the Vietnamese soldiers, so it rightly belongs to them and their heirs. But these characters are so obsessed about how America has done them wrong, they think they are entitled to it. So much so, that they will kill the Vietnamese whose land the gold has been on for 46 years. I guess this is what Spike means by 'any means necessary' which was added to his 40 Acres and a Mule logo.It's very ironic that they steal the gold from one communist country to by donated to another communist organization.Still, it had some good moments. A good editor who could cut an hour out of this movie and make it really interesting.",Da 5 Bloods

I expected the monologues, the ""trailed"" character in a scene of crisis a la his trademarks. He brought in some of my favorite aging black actors. Ultimately, the whole story felt incoherensive. Too many random players and no connection to any of them. Spoilers:
This was written and made before all these riots, but was released at the worst time possible. It has angles of hating Trumps, American domination, black degradation during war. Everyone's emotions are in shambles right now and no one of those protestors and rioters will relate in these confused times.Performance wise...spot on. Some of the finest black actors I could ask for and why why I wanted to see this movie.Ultimately, it reminded me of Miracle at St Anna. A throw away piece.

The truth is, some may love it, others may hate it. But there will still be those in between.

There are intense scenes throughout, especially one extremely tense scene that I won't spoil, but if you've seen it, you know exactly what scene I'm referring to.Overall, ""Da 5 Bloods"" is worth watching if you're a big movie person, or if you're just a casual Netflix subscriber looking for something new to watch.

562,jackcameron-63549,Timely and Timeless,8,13 June 2020,"Four African American veterans return to Vietnam to hunt for gold and the lost remains of their fallen leader, Stormin' Norman. From the beginning it is clear that this is no return to glory, but a story of unfinished business.The film jumps through time creating a dichotomy between what the Bloods were fighting for and what they've been left with. A very affecting scene sees them listening to Viet Cong propaganda, sympathetic to the injustice towards Black GIs. Any sense of patriotism or American glory normally found in war films is conspicuously absent. Lee instead shows the war as a complex mess, reflected in the lives of the four men.Lee's imagery of Norman is particularly powerful, as he teaches his comrades about black history, encouraging them to use the gold to advance black liberation. He is an almost mythic figure (strong parallels are drawn between his death and the assassination of MLK), and when in his company the past, ironically, feels safer for the Bloods than the present.Lee inserts real footage and photography of Black activists, soldiers and icons. While the film has moments of levity and a sense of adventure the constant presence of history reminds the audience that this is not a work of fiction. It gives a huge weight to the film; the Vietnam war becomes a single moment in a struggle hundreds of years old. The Bloods do not seek to defend America but fight for the America that does not yet exist.A timely and a timeless film. As entertaining as it is informative and emotional, bolstered by consistently strong performances. Lee directs with his usual flare and style, but with a driven sense of purpose. An inversion of the war genre, changing Vietnam from a mindless horror to an obvious injustice.",Da 5 Bloods

The movie's constant reminders of the wrongs done to African Americans completely dilutes and disrupts any rhythm the film could have gotten and makes the entire movie well.....confusing. The script is flimsy and the dialogue is childish and comical (not in a good way), but we're supposed to be entrenched in the seriousness of the topic....or topics.

Death of friends? Move right along. How does the black-white struggle mean anything in a foreign land where both colours killed the locals? Is that struggle a greater horror than what was perpetrated in country? Was the war just a stage for race relations? Or was the movie about the soldiers and their friendship?

Love the names of each of the leads, taken from the Motown act, The Temptations (a play on aspects of the storyline perhaps?) and the near complete Marvin Gaye ""What's Going On"" Lp as background sounds. Beautifully shot and well acted, there's little for me not to like. Some may think the Black history lessons running throughout the film are a bit much, and I can dig that, but I'm glad Spike hits us, the viewers, over the head with our history. We keep seeming to forget it.",Da 5 Bloods

I do not deny that it needs such films, what he wants to show is absolutely necessary, especially now. But unfortunately you notice at all parts of the movie that it is a Netflix movie and I try to overlook something like that, but it was too much that shows that you had no time for it or also no desire.
Everything you should learn from it and what is also historically deposited, are things you need to know. These things are the strongest parts in the movie, and they make me so benevolent with my rating. Unfortunately, a lot of potential was given away here. Since I prefer now again ""Dead Presidents"" who points to the same historical injustice, only much smarter.",Da 5 Bloods

I am shocked that such a respected director could make such a weak and out of place movie about such an important, relevant and interesting theme (especially at the moment)!!! 154 minutes of poor choices, weak script, terrible dialogues and horrible music. 154 minutes of my life I will never get back!!It feels like the movie was taken right out of the editing room after only 5-10 % of the work was done, just for the benefit of throwing this movie into the world at the moment when the world is discussing the major issues of racism.

Pacing was all over the place, music was cool but ill suited to many scenes. The action scenes didn't make sense multiple times. The constant monologues interrupting the pace, that guys voice got super annoying towards the end. The character development was erratic at times and other times went about in crazy leaps and bounds. The plot was loopy in some areas. The entire first half of the movie couldve been cut in its entirety honestly it was practically a separate movie from the second half. Overall me and my family did not enjoy it and we are avid movie fans of all genres. This movie was just a big a$$ stretch, it really couldve done with more editing. I honestly feel any notoriety this movie will get now is because of its release time coinciding with the big BLM movements of Jun 2020.",Da 5 Bloods

The story is RIDICULOUS. Unneccessary plot points and implausible characters make this movie almost unbearable to watch. Surfing unwillingly between Apocalypse Now and Tropic Thunder, this movie never finds a leg to stand on. It's tonally way off and the score is so heavy-handed that you find yourself looking for a witty comment that's just not there. Performances are on par with what you would expect from a Spike Lee joint, poignant... but again such heavy-handed directing turned them into parody. Bad parody. The ultimate cringe.

592,Lilu33,Watch a documentary instead,1,5 July 2020,"I wanted to like this so bad. Unfortunately I was left quite angry at how bad it was.If you want to learn about black soldiers in the Vietnam war I would advise watching a documentary and learning about black history and culture. This is so badly done that it will more likely turn people away from learning more on the subject, not because of any of the message itself but because the entire film is so awkward and unwatchable that anyone open to learning about the subject will instead run for the hills due to this clumsy story.Also please don't lower yourself to believing that people who don't like this film are all racists or don't understand the cultural references. Cultural references don't make a film good to watch alone, you need cultural references AND a good script, characters which pull you into the story and accurate details especially when it's a film about war.The military details need to be on point. If these details aren't in place then it makes them completely unbelievable as soldiers which distracts from the entire film. I can't comprehend why when making a film about war, it's directed without any effort being put into this part of it. This is such a basic of filmmaking that it almost feels insulting to the military and to soldiers of any race. This is an equally important part of the film, they are black SOLDIERS and yet the director completely lets them down in making them believable soldiers. This is just one of the many issues plaguing this film as well as wooden acting in some parts, badly scripted in many parts, terrible action scenes, lazy plot such as randomly stumbling across the gold and then asking if they are in the right coordinates, then agreeing this is the exact right place. If this was the right place and you've been following the map then you would already know you have reached your destination, I mean you're military men so you would know right? A quick look at the map and oh yes we are actually in the exact right place. The music was culturally significant but used in a way that distracted from the scene rather than enhanced it. Most decisions in the film in fact had this effect, distracting rather than enhancing making it very difficult to like even when trying so hard to like it all the film all the way through. I think this is why I was so angry by the end. I kept giving it chances and it just kept throwing them away one by one.I advise for anyone thinking about watching this that you may well regret it. However, please watch it and make up your own mind. Some people may like the feel of the film but I know many won't because there are so many issues distracting in every scene that it's very difficult to sink into. Many parts are so bad that I can only guess that they must have been done on purpose to create a certain sort of feeling. If so then fair enough but understand that the feeling it actually creates is very cringey, disconnected and boring to sit through for most people. If you're going to take a risk like that then don't insult viewers by calling anyone that doesn't like it racist. To do so is disgusting especially if it's been made to be purposely clumsy and awkward for the viewer. People are allowed to dislike a film regardless of the subject matter if its filmed in such an odd way. It was also comedic in parts, so much so that it took away from the weight of the more serious parts. Even when people are dying it has a strange comedy element to it in a way which completely distracts from the gravity of them dying but not enough to make in genuinely funny. This mixed with the historical clips flashing through the film make for a really crap vibe for the film as it was constantly floating in limbo with no clear direction as to what the film is itself, even though the message was there. The gravity of the clips and the history were the best parts as was some of the acting but unfortunaltely they felt wasted in the confused feel of the film and couldn't make up for all the negatives.All this is why I would recommend watching a documentary instead. You would learn much more and have a more interesting 2.5 hours just being told the real facts of the war rather than watching this bizarre film. All films are subjective so please bear in mind that people who have a different opinion aren't necessarily doing so because of an agenda. I found it difficult to believe at first that anyone could have genuinely enjoyed the film and weren't giving it 10/10 because of the background alone and not based on the film at all. However everybody is different and they obviously enjoyed all the things I hated, that is human nature for you, ones trash is another's treasure so just watch for yourself and don't worry about what other people think of your opinion on the film. You are allowed to like or dislike it without it saying anything significant about you as a person.",Da 5 Bloods

Started strong. By the end it grew disjointed and messy and started to lose my interest.Second Act:
When they found the gold it started to pick up, but that carried on way too long.Third Act:
Was pretty good, but Spike Lee tried to do too much.It seems from the way he edited the movie that he was trying to be more like Oliver Stone with his cutaways and obscure references.I would have much rather have seen more of the ""Bloods"" in Vietnam serving on missions as heroes to solidify their story even further.
Instead Lee felt he had to tell the story instead of show it.
In a movie.....a visual medium...always show it instead of tell it if you can.Then, as Spike Lee does...he got preachy especially in the end.You don't have to be overt with your symbolism. There is a way to convey a message in a movie without beating the audience over the head with it.
Lee is not good enough of a writer or director to know how to do that.This could have been a great adventure film.
There is great potential there, but Lee just tried to do too much.CHARACTERS:
Most of the acting was just okay.
The conflict resolution was over the top for most every character arc except for Otis.Delroy Lindo did a good job. He wasn't Oscar worthy.
I liked the subtle work that Clarke Peters (Otis) did in the film.Chadwick Boseman was wasted. All of the talk about his character and his heroics, but Lee never showed enough of that.The son was a wasted character. He was unnecessary as were the LAMB people.
Too long. About midway through I had to check to see how much was left.
Lee simply should have shown the Bloods in Vietnam fighting together, and then cut back and forth to them on their heist juxtaposing the two. Absolutely not enough Vietnam shown.It was average. Spike Lee is quite overrated as a director and writer.",Da 5 Bloods

Sure, QT will kick them in the junk once in a while but they will settle back into spoon fed drivel in no time. Some may just hate the political statement a film makes. That's a shame because they miss the art.

VietCong didn't wander the countryside, unarmed, talking about dinner waiting to be ambushed, squads of infantry don't execute ambushes hip to hip on one knee, and on and on...None of the special effects were believable. The overemphasis on everyone and everything being black was too much of an exclamation point on Lee's point of view when only 12% of the forces serving in Vietnam were African American.

This film was none of that. It was two and a half hours of utter useless mess to in my opinion simply promote the BLM movement. It was boring, confusing and tiring to watch. I love Delroy Lindo he's an incredible actor usually but he was far too emotionally awkward to watch for that length of time. It was not good at all. I love Chadwick Boseman (RIP) but he hardly featured (why?!!) and yet he was still the best actor of the film by miles! Why were the old actors in the flashbacks as old men?

It's either lovely or terrible, depending on what you're looking for.On a purely technical level, this was a good watch. The editing felt fresh and interesting, the acapella Marvin Gaye soundtrack creates a riveting atmosphere and the performances are solid for the most part, with Delroy Lindo really standing out as the star of this movie. Brilliant work on his part.Unfortunately, all of these elements are strapped together with a script that leaves a lot to bedesired. The pacing is off and suspense is built in ways that feel very forced and artificial. There are several great scenes, but they're connected by a lot of filler that frequently left me a bit bored. There's a good film in here somewhere, it just needs a more concise vision and a shorter runtime.Lastly, the film tries to be socially conscious, but really only plays lip service. For a movie about the unjust treatment of black soldiers, I was taken aback by how stereotypically Da 5 Bloods treated the Vietnamese people in turn. Almost all of them are either idiots or evil villains with no backstory. And of course, the whole thing has to end in a heroic final shootout. The promise of the film is interesting enough, but unfortunately the whole thing just falls short because it lacks nuance.Watch it for the editing, watch it for Delroy Lindo's gripping performance, just don't go in there expecting a memorable storyline.",Da 5 Bloods

638,danmelli,Overly long and underwhelming,4,14 June 2020,"It's no secret that Spike Lee is an intriguing filmmaker. Throughout his career, works like Do the Right Thing and BlackKklansman have not only entertained us, but Lee has made his mark on cinema through the themes of these films. However, in my opinion, in the case of Da 5 Bloods, the standard we could expect from Spike Lee was not met.Yes, the cinematography is decent. There are some nice shots and camerawork capturing the Vietnamese landscape. But there's nothing we haven't seen before, and the film's environmental features can only take it so far. This film is not so driven by war sequences, as the trailer would have you believe, but rather by dialogue - a LOT of dialogue. And unfortunately, it doesn't lead anywhere interesting.Granted, Lee didn't write the film solo, so I can't fault him completely. But it seems almost as if he thought that making this film unnecessarily long would inherently make it good. No, not every movie is good just because it is 2.5 hours. And this one felt like every minute of its running time was dragging. I fount myself watching it in small doses, and at some points it actually felt like a chore to get through. The problem is, aside from a few timely lines about our current political crisis in the US, there's not much character development and the conversations become ultimately meaningless.This isn't a war film. It tries to be a character study about friendship with some comedy and historical fiction, but really it doesn't engage the viewer enough with its thin story to fill its running time effectively. The main reason to watch it is for Lee's direction, but we've already seen better from him.",Da 5 Bloods

643,Sycamorish,An honourable failure,5,23 June 2020,"I really love Spike Lee and probably subscribe to 90% of his politics but this film didn't work for me and didn't seem to succeed on its own terms. I think it deserves praise for aiming quite high and taking creative risks and there were scenes and ideas that were effective and stayed with me despite the issues. Hence, it's an honourable failure.Firstly, as noted elsewhere tonally this film leaps a lot. I think this is deliberate as a way of showing the way the characters relive and misremember their wars. It's probably the most post modern war film I've seen in a while. One very interesting device is swapping to the cheesy soundtracks, grainy look and aspect ratio of an 80s action film. It's constantly reminding us how Hollywood retconned Vietnam with it's own myth making.That would be fine in itself if there wasn't also the attempt to go one further and juxtapose the Hollywood dream version with really graphic documentary footage of the sort that Ken Burns used unflinchingly in his Vietnam series. I was most struck by a lingering shot of a small child with their face blown off and could see that Lee wanted this to have a huge impact. I think Lee wanted the audience to ask what we wanted to see - violence as entertainment or something darker.The point is if you're going to go there, you need to handle the rest of the film as seriously or at least succeed absolutely in balancing elements of farce and exploitation with real life atrocities.And this is where the flippant nature of the action adventure stuff undercut the serious themes to the point where it started feeling disrespectful or exploitative rather than challenging. The most glaring example was introducing the mine removal squad when they did which basically took any of the pathos out of the jungle walk as it became all about ""who will step on the mine"", and even played it up by having a character make a big campy speech while walking back into the undergrowth to meet the inevitable splatter. This was so telegraphed as it HAD to be played for laughs, but then immediately followed by a gory aftermath and a tense situation where another character had to escape the same fate. Despite being a film about PTSD, minutes later everyone (even the non vets) were apparently over the horror.I do think this cutting between modes of telling the Vietnam story is deliberate and overall the film probably works best when seen as a collage of impressions of war, trauma and entertainment but that does mean it's pretty much the antithesis of good story telling.",Da 5 Bloods

647,tropicalgardener,Another Spike Lee comedy...or...,3,27 August 2020,"Having spent a significant part of my life living in Vietnam, I've taken something of an interest in its history and the war's effect on both its people & the combatants who came here from the US. Indeed, this period has also produced some of the most fascinating yet harrowing cinematography to be placed on celluloid (In the Year of the Pig from 1968 being one such example). So, with the prospect of four black former (albeit fictitious) G.I.s returning to find their fallen comrade and the usually controversial yet consistently good Spike Lee behind the camera, I was expecting more of his silver screen magic.Sadly thought, what could have been a great story quickly descends into what I can only really call a farcical, agitprop strewn propaganda piece that seeks to use the main story as a sideshow for promoting the modern day vices of wallowing in self-pity, self-imposed 'victimhood' & resentment coupled with bouts of TDS & the inevitable nod to BLM. Even the archetypally contrite, guilt-ridden white girl is there too just to top it all off. Finally, many of the Vietnamese individuals who appear in the film are also portrayed as still being irate & bitter over the war when in fact, nothing could be further from the truth. The Vietnamese are some of the most magnanimous people in existence and with the exception of a few amongst their oldest generation, everybody else has moved on; something that a certain cabal of 'activists' in the West could do well to learn from and emulate.It goes without saying that by the middle of the film my wife (who is Vietnamese) was regularly descending into uncontrollable fits of laughter over the absurdity of much of it and I would have to confess that I found a good deal of it excessively ludicrous too. Ultimately, this film is littered with multiple continuity, factual and plot errors propped up by numerous ideologically derived clichés which all serve to reduce this offering to little more than a chaotic, Kafkaesque mess. So, if you're looking for a good Spike Lee film to while away a couple of hours, then this definitely isn't the one for you...",Da 5 Bloods
648,meryfela,What a brilliant fabulous movie,10,20 August 2020,"I've just watched one of the most fascinating films I have ever seen in my 70+ years of life. Spike Lee nailed this one good and proper. This movie has a profundity of humour, tragedy, loyalty, friendship, brotherhood, deep philosophical thinking delivered in a commonplace way, political sharpness, some terrific acting, and the biggest heart you could possibly imagine. It seems this movie was not for some folks. I'm not sure what they expected. But, for me, Spike Lee has delivered his masterpiece. Grossly enjoyable. I really wanted to give it 11/10.",Da 5 Bloods

650,paulsandowsky,The strangest film experience this year,2,5 July 2020,"Da Five Bloods is the new Spike Lee film on Netflix. I have a bit to say about it. There are some very poignant and powerful messages , images and information in the film that are told in true Spike Lee fashion. The main message is that Black veterans fought in Vietnam for freedoms that they didn't even receive in their own country. However, the film seems to take a bizarre road from a very obvious point about halfway through. Suddenly it turns into some Chuck Norris and Dolomite low budget Vietnam Blaxploitation movie with a script that is so horrendous and corny that it's absolutely hilarious. This extreme shift in genre left me with such mixed feelings , because I was laughing at a film with such serious messages which worked so well in Jo Jo Rabbit but it just didn't work half as well in this film. This is a Vietnam action adventure satire with strong political messages. I'm sorry to say that I'd have to give this film only a 2 Star rating but saying that , I'm really glad I saw it. This is Apocalypse Now, Jewel of the Nile, Chuck Norris (Missing in Action), The Expendables , Dolomite and The Room all rolled into one film. Absolutely horrendous and hilarious with an important message thrown in and some really graphic images and real footage. What a roller coaster of a film.

The story is completely implausible and the acting awful. This had all the ingredients of a good adventure film with historical information to enlighten the viewer (the historical education was the reason I gave it a 2 and not a 1) but instead you got a film that didn't know what it was, I can't believe the writers could do such a bad job.

I am a big fan of Vietnam era movies and even though I knew the ""white man racist, Donald Trump bad"" themes would be pushed, I tried to be open minded, but this movie just was not good.You have a group of great actors with really bad acting (I was extremely disappointed with Chadwick Boseman's performance). A treasure hunting plot that has been done successfully dozens of times before absolutely falls apart here. An unbelievably predictable story. Poorly written characters (Paul & Otis seem to be the only one with story arks, everyone else is just there for the ride) and a bizarre soundtrack.The flashbacks where all of the characters are the same actors that play their older selves also seemed really lazy too. A grueling 2.5 hour run time also made the movie feel like a chore to watch instead of something enjoyable. Lastly, the preachiness that I mentioned before became the punchline to the film but I suppose that is what Lee was going for anyways.The reason I gave this film 3 stars is because there were times when I felt that the film COULD redeem itself, but never did. I like that it touched on PTSD and mental illness, as well as inequality and civil rights, but that was it. Just a touch. No resolution. No answers. Just a quick nod.Bottom Line: the film had potential to be a good story while also addressing important social issues, but ultimately fell flat on almost all fronts.

The acting is great with Delroy Lindo delivering a fantastic performance. Clarke Peters is also amazing along with Jonathan Majors. The story comes across a muddled to me at some points. There's not a lot of characterization for anyone except maybe two or three of the characters. The film sort of keeps going after a while when it should've stopped like an half hour before. There's also some subplot regarding a girl and her friends that have some sort of organization that searches for land mines which is pretty stupid and only serves as a way for there to be a character death and for there to be an action scene.I enjoyed it though for the most part. Again the acting is top tier. The social commentary is well done and is subtle for the most part. The first hour and half was enjoyable and it sort of drags itself to the end after that.

BlackKlansman, Spike's previous film, is far superior, and yet it's only 7.5 vs 6.7 for ""Bloods"" in IMDB. This film was 30-45 minutes too long. The interaction between the friends strained credulity--very warm one moment, at gunpoint the next. the pigeon-toed guy who footed the bill for the trip...he never would've made it in the Army. 4-F, no doubt! You don't traipse aimlessly around certain fields once you KNOW they are dangerous.and the flashback sequences seemed faxed in. So....not really believable, and yet it was a fun, entertaining film. It's interesting that the characters are named for the Temptations. It does convey the idea that those that served continue to live w/ their experience in Vietnam. Still, it has a made for TV feel to it that has me confused. As a Stones fan, I'll made the analogy that comparing Da Bloods to BlackKlansman is like comparing the Stones' classic ""Let it Bleed"" to enjoyable modern Stones albums like ""Voodoo Lounge"" Fun, but not much magic.",Da 5 Bloods

The high points of the film came from laughing at the VC fighters death collapse on Stormin Norman (the almost mythical 1 eyed Willy of the film) followed by, I dont know how many rolls upon being pushed off the body by the character Paul and also Paul's snake bite ordeal where the rubber snake seems to have been looted from the Chuckle Brothers forgotten prop box.

It takes songs that are very relevant to the topic of war, PTSD, and racism. The cinematography is also pretty good. There is definitely a style to this movie. Some parts of the movie are shot to look like it was actually footage of the Vietnam War. There are some moments of the movie that came out of nowhere and completely took me by surprise, and other moments had me on the edge of my seat. There are some very funny scenes too. But there are also scenes that make you question if you really want to watch the rest of the movie. For example, there is footage and images of actual deaths and dead bodies, one of which take place within the first 10 minutes of the movie. This can be very disturbing to some people, including me, as it took me by surprise. But past all that, there is a lot of good history in this movie too. One scene they talked about a kid who jumped on a grenade to save his friends, and they show a picture of him and tell you his name. The acting is fairly decent. Delroy Lindo did an amazing job. Fantastic acting on all accounts by him. The dialogue on the other hand, is sub - par. Many lines are badly delivered and cringey. Another thing is the run time of a little over 2 hours and 30 minutes. It is a long movie, and slow at some points. Then there is the political messages and other things trying to be pushed, but this is not very prominent and can be ignored. One thing that cannot be ignored and is actually a good thing is paying homage to the black soldiers that fought in the Vietnam War.

As it went, King created the ficticious author Bachman to see if his continued success was driven by his growing fame, or was the success authenticly based on his skill. King wrote several titles as Bachman, many which sold fairly well, including popular titles like Thinner and the Running Man.
With Spike Lee, if also wanting to do such a test to see if his continued market success is due actual talent or simply just his fame, then he obviously couldn't use a fictious name credit (it would leak since too many people are involed in a movie, unlike a book), so the next best thing would be to make the absolute worst movie possible that his producers would allow. Then, if this trainwreck movie was deemed a dud then it would be no suprise and he'd maybe feel that he should believe that the reviews of his other movies were at least honest. But if the trainwreck recieved sweeping acclaim by the mainstream reviewers, then it'd be obvious his ""success"" was probably based merely on his fame (or in the current climate, based on fear of racial backlash?),
So I hope for Lee, in a way, that this movie was his ""test"" (even though, judging from all the excellent reviews, he failed). Because if this wasn't a test, and this trainwreck of a Vietnam movie truely was the best that Lee could manage, then I really feel sorry for him.",Da 5 Bloods

686,elicornell-89188,Surprisingly stunning and unique. Disappointed in the end though.,8,16 June 2020,"I hesitated watching a movie from Spike Lee, but the subject matter was an interest to me. The storyline was deep, impactful, and fluid. The cast was solid, but spattered along way were plenty of racially charged cheap shots costing me to respect the work as a whole. Then again spike lee has made his career creating racially charged cinema so should I have been surprised by his continued racial gaffs and cheap shot propaganda. Within the movie Trump is called a klansman, and George Washington is noted to have owned 123 slaves. Poor Spike, lest he forget the Moore's invasion of Italy and the pillage, plundering, and rape of its people. All races within humanity have done wrong to another race somewhere along the line. It's unfortunate that Spike Lee couldn't tell the story without racially inciting and continuing to heat and drive the divide.
Still in the end minus the incendiary racial provocations. When it's finished I found myself loving the story of this band of bothers brought together because of a common bond and interest.",Da 5 Bloods
687,BigBeatFromBadsville,Bludgeoned by THE MESSAGE,2,17 June 2020,"OK, cards on the table, I'm a middle class white male in my 40s living in London. I don't profess to fully understand 'the black experience' but i'm educated and empathetic enough to at least appreciate the countless misdeeds done to black people over the course of centuries and for which 'justice' (whatever that actually encompasses) has yet to be realised. Anyone with a heart and a brain would be horrified by the murder of George Floyd and many others that have died in similar ways at the hands of the authorities.
However, I have now read a number of reviews from respected film critics praising this film and lauding the director and can only conclude that they either haven't watched it or are so terrified of being called a racist and publicly shamed online that they feel pressured to kowtow to the mob.
Let me be clear then - this is a poorly written film with a derisory plot,. It is far too long and is so lacking in subtlety that it feels like you are being hit over the head every few minutes with THE MESSAGE (that black people have suffered countless injustices).
We know that Spike and trying to shoehorn this in at every (in)conceivable juncture is just tedious,
Finally, (SPOILER ALERT) can anyone explain to me why the Vietnamese gangsters near the end of the film wish to make a deal for the gold in exchange for the landmine chap when they are pointing AK47s at 'da bloods'? I give it an extra star for that for making me laugh out loud!",Da 5 Bloods
688,hmdbDVM,This movie is a mess,2,23 June 2020,"Upon watching this film it became clear this movie was made with the sole purpose of making a political statement, and yet it still missed that mark. The story line is intriguing but the character dialogue and development are both lacking severely. One of the main characters is erratic to a point where it's difficult to follow or stay interested. Delroy Lindo turns in a great performance, but his character was doomed by the writers. His constant state of back and forth personality makes it hard to develop an attachment to him as an audience member and subsequently has the same effect on the other characters. Flashbacks are frequently used throughout the movie but the interesting thing is that the director made no effort to show any of the main characters as younger versions of themselves (though the flashbacks would put them 50 years younger!). You can also anticipate just about every 'turn' the movie is going to take. The later in the movie you get the more the plot seems to just wash away. Really just a messy, confusing movie.",Da 5 Bloods
689,duongadamq,"Lacking Depth, Understanding, and Sensitivities",1,19 June 2020,"Self-aggrandizing and pretentious. It veers you in the wrong direction, but the film creators think that's okay. It's not okay for people who understand history, racism, and Vietnam.A movie about Black Americans subjected to war by White American political leaders that classify them as secondary citizens. The actors come out of the war with PTSD, losing themselves in the battlefield, and still feeling the pain that White America inflicted and still inflicts on them today.However, it tackles the injustices that they've been subjected to with war provocations.For example, the scene in the Vietnamese floating boat market where a poor boat merchant tries to sell the main actor a live chicken (how absurd, in a floating market, really?), and he refuses, calling him a ""Gook.""The merchant replies, ""You killed my mother and father,"" and threatens to kill the black former GI for not purchasing his live chicken and calling him a ""Gook.""I mean, how absurd is this? If you had an inkling of understanding for Vietnamese culture, you would know that Vietnamese people are not like that at all. The majority of the South population (where this movie is shot) is made up of people under age 40. In fact, approximately 70% are.In fact, they love Americans. They love Western culture. Native Vietnamese people have opened up bars like ""Apocalypse Now"" for Americans. Vietnamese-Americans provide the largest amount of remittances to Vietnamese citizens. Americans in general are one of the largest contributors to their GDP. American business owners provide dollars to the booming textile industry.This really hits me: Why would you shoot a battle scene in 2020 between Americans and Vietnamese?One common theme: Americans are responsible for war crimes, and so are Vietnamese.Please tell me how pointing the finger at someone promotes change.How does this change racial division? It appears to stir it up.So this is coming to terms with inequality: degrading and being condescending toward Vietnamese people?The whole movie I found my blood pressure rising, and oftentimes wanting to close my eyes because the movie was filmed in Vietnam, and yet it failed to grasp the current state of mind of Vietnamese people, which are mostly forward-thinking.When you group all Vietnamese people into what you perceive to be a Vietnamese countryside way of life: slow, poor, unable to move past war sentimentality, and always seeking retribution against Americans - you fail to understand Vietnam.This leaves you with nothing but flashbacks of recorded history and old stereotypes.I suggest you don't watch this movie if you fall under the following: 1) You're Vietnamese; 2) You've been to Vietnam and understand the culture, daily life, and way of thinking; and 3) You're not easily fascinated with creators that convey that they want social change in their own country, but show no cultural sensitivities when they arrive as tourists or filmmakers in other people's countries....",Da 5 Bloods
690,noahlong-73546,"Good concept, Good acting, Weird script, Bad pacing",4,19 June 2020,"When I saw this movie I was intrigued by the concept of a group of vets returning to Vietnam to reclaim gold that they had hidden away during the war. Knowing Spike I figured it was gonna be a gung-ho, balls to the wall exciting ride, with a lot of dope lessons & heavy black influence. It was some of those things.. sometimes.The movie starts with a history lesson on the events of the late 60's to early 70's. The war, the civil rights movement, Watergate, etc., & mixes 'The Bloods' into the end of the montage. It introduces them by reuniting them in 'Nam & talking about their plan, then jumps into the war flashbacks. The same actors are playing them in the flashbacks.. still old, which I thought was cool. The action was very campy & stylized, &the 16mm filming enhances it, but after about 30 minutes, the plot dilutes itself in a very weird way. This movie didn't need to be 2 1/2 hours long.The acting was terrible in some scenes, & amazing in others. Some of the actors would deliver an awful line in one scene, then an oscar worthy performance in the next. Delroy Lindo stole the show, he has always been one of my favorite actors, but a lot of the character motivations are too in-your-face & I understand if some of it was hard to act realistically.Before this review gets too long, I should just say that it had some good messages sometimes, especially considering the events going on here in 2020. Spike was just too on the nose in some ways, & tried to implement too many ideas into this film, which made it very complicated in other ways. Both my friends I was watching it with went to bed before it was over. I wanted to like it so badly. I held out for some amazing finale, but it just never delivered in a way that was meaningful. I'm not sure if I could or couldn't recommend at least giving it a watch.Also, there is no way Netflix didn't pay all of the critics to give this movie 8-9+ star reviews. I can see how people might like it, but seeing people saying it's oscar worthy is laughable. I love the actors, love the idea, & I love Spike, but he just didn't hit it out of the park on this one.Last but not least, black lives matter, & shout out Marvin Gaye.",Da 5 Bloods

So many things depicted wrongly and inaccurately. Sad. You obviously did not do your homework, and at my expense I might add.My #1 criteria for most movies is Believability. There was no believability with this story. Zilch. It was mish-mash at best. It has the appearance of a production gone very wrong and only becoming salvageable because of Netflix deal and a global pandemic. Box Office receipts would most likely have been very bad.This movie will not be a hit with black veterans either. In fact, my guess is that it will be an embarrassment.Suggestion? Stick to what you know. ...said the Vietnamese chicken vendor to the psychopathic vet.And by the way, why continue the same, sad, and condescending look at the proud and vigilant Vietnamese people? Presenting black veteran soldiers (and all soldiers) as victims of a rotten empirical power (USA) should equally qualify all Vietnamese people similarly.

697,imfisher,"Good underlying messages, but some sloppy execution",5,26 June 2020,"First off, I'd say see the movie. The only reason for such a low review is for some sloppy aspects of the film. Don't be discouraged by the low reviews as it is not by any means a bad movie. That being said, don't expect a film well done as his other films such as Black KkKlansman.Good:
Underlying messages. Spike has always been political and shoves it in your face. In this movie, I think it was well executed, especially with scene cuts to historical visuals and such.Music. I loved the use of the musical scores in the film. Especially utilizing modified songs to fit certain scenes and emotions.Themes/Topics. This could go under underlying messages, but oh well. I believe that Spike brought up topics that need more light shed upon them. Again, how he displayed these topics and issues was well done.Visuals: It's not going to be lauded for its cinematography, but I did find that some of the frames to be well shot and the use of warm/cold tones was fairly well done. I especially appreciated the change in aspect ratio when cutting between flashbacks and present day.Bad:
Continuity: Every movie will have issues with this but certain aspects really irritated me. Chiefly, using the same cast to portray the characters during present day and Vietnam era. Ages don't line up. This may have been an after thought but it's disappointing as it is so glaring that it draws attention away from the better points of the film.Dialogue: I did enjoy the cast and they did very well with what they were given. That being said, I think whoever wrote the script did it in piecemeal, and many times I found the dialogue to be iffy and not well done.-Plot: Just like the dialogue, I found this to be an issue. Spike tried to tackle several issues and unlike other films that can intertwine plots/ points well, Spike missed the mark. Several times I felt like an issue was being addressed and then a split second later, that topic was dropped in favor of advancing another issue.
Overall, important topics were investigated but poor planning led to choppy execution and a lack of closure. Instead of a defined end, the film left me at a loss, wanting more development. You can't fit everything into a movie, but some aspects that this film wanted to discuss were not fully explored.",Da 5 Bloods

702,minhphuong-47398,I really really wanted to love this film :(,2,8 July 2020,"Maybe I set my standards too high before watching the film and that is why it was a deception to me, but I really wanted to love this film. From the Vietnam war theme to the Afro-American point of view on this conflict, I was to eager to find out how Spike Lee would tell us this story especially after watching the trailer that only got my expectations even higher.However, after 20 minutes of film, it was really difficult for me to finish it (but I did force myself !). Which is really a pity. It is such a waste of good ideas. There were lots of elements that were in the film and I was very pleased to see them there but... how to say this? It is like having a very good story to tell but telling it in a way that is cringey, cheesy and almost boring to people...So in favor of this film, I would say that it had good ideas : the theme, mixing the historical facts in it with authentic clips...But the way the story was told...
In the trailer, it was a juxtaposition of historical clips and present day film and it worked ! It was entrancing, I wanted to know more about these people, what did they do exactly ? How important were they in the conflict?But in the film... It was the same as if I was shown powerpoint slides on these same people and it lost its charm. You know, it's a bit like sometimes, some teachers at school make you love some subjects, while countless others make you feel very bored with endless slides even when the subject is actually one of your passion. This was the same thing for me.Another major thing in the film I didn't like is the fact that there were no dimension to the supporting characters. I mean, yes it is literally called ""supporting characters"", but I felt so clearly that the other characters were just a ""tool"" for the story to move forward. Let's take for example the Vietnamese guide Vinh. Of course in the Vietnamese culture, people try to not be resentful towards American citizens and even forgive the GIs that killed Vietnamese people and among them their brothers, sisters, parents, children...Because it is in their culture to do so. But even if that's the case, they are still human. How could someone be as calm as if it was someone else's story when someone insult you or say really bad things making you the one that killed their comrades while your own father went to the same war and lost his brother and maybe his arms and legs?And this is not all with this character, in the end of the film he is just there to help the main characters as if he didn't have his own opinion. Or maybe he is just really greedy but he didn't hesitate even a second when the ""bad"" Vietnamese came there to shoot everyone and take the gold, he immediately shot them back.
He knew on which side he was. But in reality would that decision be so easy to take ? Or would he rather flee ? Or beg the other Vietnamese ? Because it was not his business after all, he didn't owe the main characters anything. And facing death, I wonder if this was a realistic portrayal of human emotions.Thirdly, the dialogues... They were so flat...and cheesy. Especially the ones involving a Vietnamese or more. I have to recognize the effort of putting grammatically correct and well pronounced Vietnamese language in the film. The dialogues though are like a ""google translate"" version of a western dialogue. And when these original western dialogues are already cheesy, you know that it can't get better with a translation to another language.
Indeed, each country has its language and culture. And the language is like a way to express how people behave according to their cultures, beliefs etc. People in Europe don't show their emotions or talk like people in Africa, and that's the same thing with every country we can find in the world. So when you know some of Vietnamese culture or East Asian cultures, you will know that there are some things that people don't say because of their cultures.
It is really really rare for example for a mother to say to her daughter ""I love you, good night"" as if it was something said every nights and then kiss on the forehead. Words have weight. Especially in this culture. While this seems normal for an occidental family situation, in a Vietnamese family, when a mother says ""I love you"" to her child... there is something wrong : they will never ever see each other again, or for a long long long time, or the mother will die in 5 minutes...And this result in some cringey feelings for the people that understand Vietnamese cultures. What I want to say is not every culture show feelings and emotions the same way. When some American would tell their daughters they love them 3 times per day, a Vietnamese mother will show her love by making her diner for example or doing some small services.A last thing that annoyed me are the references they tried to put in the film. Like the Ride of the Valkyrie reminding once again Apocalypse Now when they go into the jungle for ""the beginning"" of the adventure.... I don't know why but that was really cringey :/ . I think what annoyed me is that they wanted to relate (too much?) to the audience which knows in majority this soundtrack and where it comes from. But it seems too forced upon me.To end this ""rant"" ^^ (I am sorry if I sound really negative) I was so disappointed with the storytelling of the film.

I think it was D W Griffiths who once said ""In a way, movies are a lot like rifles"". Of course, Griffiths preferred his Klansmen white but I don't think he could deny the quality of Spike Lee's last joint. ""BlacKkKlansman"" is an M21 sniper rifle of a movie: a well-designed well-crafted heavy hitter that knocks down its targets with deadly precision. In comparison ""Da 5 Bloods"" is an early M16: underdeveloped and flimsy, jammed up with mud, not even good for bludgeoning people over the head. Looks like Spike forgot his Basic Training: Slap, Pull, Observe, Release, Tap, Shoot (but not necessarily in that order).
Also ""BlacKkKlansman"" was simultaneously absurdly funny and deadly serious, the clever dark humour of title says it all. There are zero laughs in ""Da 5 Bloods"" as I remember it. (I can't fit that into the gun metaphor because there's nothing funny about guns kids! Stay in School. Don't do Drugs.) Its as heavy and turgid and unimaginative as a Vietnam War quagmire simile.
All flippancy aside, for me this movie doesn't do justice to a story that is more complicated and ultimately more tragic: In the name of Freedom which they didn't really have, and for the love of their country which didn't love them in return, Black GIs participated in terrible events which left them guilt-ridden and traumatised for the rest of their lives.

The brutality is completely unacceptable because it is not motivated.

722,ryanbonner-99754,Wasted potential unfortunately,2,5 February 2021,"I discovered Spike Lee through 2018's 'BlacKkKlansman' which I loved. 'Do The Right Thing' and 'Malcolm X' are also career highlights of his. 'Inside Man' is also a great film and so I was excited for 'Da 5 Bloods'. With the drought of cinema due to COVID and the current political climate I thought this film could not have landed at a better time. Sadly I think the creative team, particularly on a script writing level, should have waited longer. I was very disappointed by the film.I have since let my thoughts settle on the film since the initial Netflix release. The current discourse around the omission of 'Da 5 Bloods' from the Golden Globes nominations prompted me to revisit the film and my feelings have not changed unfortunately.On a technical level, the film is wildly unruly which some have praised as inventive or anarchic even but I personally found to be disengaging. The film is 2 hours and 36 minutes long but unfortunately feels far longer. There is nothing wrong with a film being long if it has the content to justify the runtime but 'Da 5 Bloods' unfortunately doesn't. Equally the plot amounts to very little and the characters all seem to change their motivations and personalities from scene to scene in order to pad out the runtime of the film, which adds to the disengagement.On an aesthetic level, many of the most memorable moments are clunky homages to much better films such as 'Apocalypse Now' and 'Treasure of the Sierra Madre' which just leave you wondering why you aren't watching these films instead. Don't get me wrong, homage is no bad thing, and Lee himself has done it successfully before, Radio Raheem's knuckle dusters in 'Do The Right Thing' for example. However, in a film this I'll disciplined they only serve to exacerbate the problems that the film has.On a positive note, the cast themselves are not terrible, as some have said, rather they do the best they can with a bad script. Much praise has been given to Delroy Lindo for his work in the film, and I would agree that his performance in the film showcases his acting chops in as much that his character is perhaps the worst written in terms of inconsistencies and Lindo manages to elevate the character to a level that the script has not earned. And so to a degree Lindo deserves praise and certainly he deserves more casting opportunities because he is clearly a great actor. Chadwick Boseman is definitely the stand out in the cast and his charisma oozes off of the screen, his Stormin' Norman is easily the films most believable character and I would attribute this entirely to Boseman. Unfortunately he isn't in the film nearly enough to redeem it however but the film is infinitely better whenever he is on screen.The film also looks great, Newton Thomas Sigel's cinematography is really good. The 16mm film flashbacks are particularly great. The soundtrack is also great, and the nod to The Temptations in the character names is a nice touch though the characters don't all necessarily resemble their namesakes in their behaviour which leaves it as a slightly confusing or empty choice to an extent.The film also doesn't de-age the actors for the flashbacks which is a bold choice and definitely could have worked as a distinct visualisation of the psyche of the characters if the film wasn't so confused otherwise. But the film is so confused which unfortunately makes this choice become a distraction more than anything else.
Then there is the political aspect. 'Do The Right Thing' in particular but also 'BlackKklansman' to an extent showcase that Spike Lee can make extremely political films with nuance. Unfortunately 'Da 5 Bloods' suffers from a severe nuance deficiency.Telling a US Vietnam soldier story from the perspective of Black Veterans is a smart choice and is a unique perspective that hasn't been focused on as much before in such a singular way that I can recall. This ought to be the great innovation of the film and is an incredibly interesting idea and absolutely a worthwhile and fresh endeavour for a film. However, the film misses the mark quite considerably.The level of knowledge on the Vietnam war evidenced in the film seems to be that which a year 9 history student could have attained by half paying attention in class and then watching 'Apocalypse Now' . This substandard understanding is then uncomfortably warped to then fit Lee's own ideological issues about present day America. This is a real shame, because, outside of works on Muhammad Ali, I don't think there is much mainstream coverage of the black experience in Vietnam but here it is very clumsily handled.The worst of this is in the portrayal of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people themselves for the most part. As awful as the experience in Vietnam must have been for US soldiers of all races, though there is a unique aspect to the black experience that could have been explored better here, the war did happen in Vietnam. Vietnamese people had to deal with an invasion from a global superpower and suffer endless bombing campaigns and atrocities such as the My Lai massacre at the hands of the US and the various invaders before them. The film makes gestures to such events through archival footage which is far more impactful than any of the fictional scenes in the movie and rightfully so but it leaves you wondering why such harrowing footage is being intercut with Da 5 Bloods (technically Da 4 Bloods) and their farcical treasure hunt. Juxtaposing the iconic and haunting image of Phan Thi Kim Phuc for example with Delroy Lindo and his mates playing Dora the Explorer comes across as just a bit distasteful. Though I don't believe this is the intent by any means but unfortunately it is the end product.Equally the Vietnamese characters in the film could generously be described as 2 dimensional at best. The treatment of the Vietnamese in 'Da 5 Bloods' is eerily reminiscent of the portrayal of Native Americans in some of the worst westerns of the 50s. Which, would be reprehensible enough, but in a film which places so much emphasis on racial injustice it only highlights the appalling depiction of the Vietnamese characters in the film and undermines the cumbersome delivery of a relatively straightforward political message. Lê Y Lan does nothing more than be a love interest for Clark Peters' Otis while Johnny Trí Nguyen plays the stereotypical tour guide role and they are perhaps the best served by the film. Practically every other Vietnamese character in the film is used as either canon fodder for the Westerners to play target practice with or they fit other quaint stereotypes such as Chu, the chicken seller.This combined with a bizarre third act which seems to have been lifted straight from a Michael Bay film all seem to reinforce very uncomfortable Neo-Colonialist narratives which all seems completely at odds with the political argument that Spike Lee seems to be trying to make with the film. There is genuinely a line in the first act which pokes fun at the Rambo movies for being crass and nationalistic which on first viewing made me chuckle slightly but seems completely ludicrous when the film just completely devolves into the exact same infantile claptrap by the third act except it is entirely Po faced and without any sense of irony in doing this. 'First Blood' is a far more nuanced look at the Vietnam war and ptsd than 'Da 5 Bloods' could ever dream of being and it is this complete lack of self awareness that is the biggest flaw of the film.Don't get me wrong, the film has very noble aspirations but it fails to meet them in quite spectacular fashion, contradicting itself at virtually every turn on a filmmaking level but also more disturbingly on a political and historical level. The worst of it all is that Spike Lee has proven before that he can pull this off and I am sure he will do it again but this really is not the one.",Da 5 Bloods

Only reason he could have maintained making films is his earlier films which were good indeed . This films has not even have a story to tell. The director had a good chance making a real entertaining film and he was unable to hold my attention longer than 5 minutes at a time. The actors were great and even the story on its own was a good story to make a film around. But...:
1- there is no consistency in this film, we are shown current events with flashbacks which do not make sense in any way.
2- the film mostly just wat to make the statement that african american soldiers participated in the wars us has waged without any benefit to them...which is indeed true and we all know this.

The older actors are not playing younger versions of themselves, they are the same age as in our present time because they survived the war, while Chadwick Boseman's character did not. That's just stupidity if you don't pick up on that. I've been a harsh critic of Spike Lee for the longest time because he as been so damn uneven in his directing, but BlacKkKlansman turned it around for me (one of the best movies of the 2010s), and that's his best movie since Do the Right Thing IMO. In Da 5 Bloods he keeps going strong, and this is yet another fantastic movie. Not as good as the previously two mentioned, but still pretty damn good!

The director just put in a lot of distasteful, bad decision making from the vets and then making them playing victim and blaming game. The way Vietnam is portrayed is really damaging and no where near real life. I was laughing with the idea of American director with all of the ""then I start blasting my guns"" bullcrap in Vietnam. I'm sure as hell that no American is able to casually bring a gun into the country, let alone carrying it around and shooting people. The Vietnam war was a terrible past with a lot of blood spilled from both side. We, as the Vietnamese, have been trying so hard to make peace with the past in order to move forward into a better future.

744,joneskee1911,I Want Netflix's Money Back for Their Sake,1,3 July 2020,"I reactivated my IMDB account because I was so utterly disappointed with this movie.I don't even know where to start, honestly. As an Black veteran, I was really looking forward to this movie, but had to end the movie after 1 hour! Spike Lee had no direction in this movie. He and the writers try to tackle *way* too many issues. There is the issue of PTSD in veterans; the issue of Vietnam veterans getting no recognition; the issue of racism in the Vietnam-era US military; the myriad of issues surrounding the civil rights movement in the US; the issue of MLK Jr.'s death; the issue President Trump; the issue of landmines left over in Vietnam; the issue of reconciliation with an enemy from 50 years prior; the issue of Black history being underrepresented; the issue of 'the ugly American' and I am sure a few more would have popped up if I continued the movie.The issues Spike Lee should have focused on should have been: getting unknown and better-known actors to understand the objective of their character; ironing out the story line, GETTING YOUNGER ACTORS TO PLAY THE CHARACTERS when they went to their flashback scenes--if it is supposed to make an allusion to the idea that Norman will always stay young because he is dead, so be it, but at least make the characters look a little younger (Spike Lee used the same actors for the characters in their flashback scenes as when they are in old age as though they were some weird Benjamin Button/Twilight characters). Oh, and we get it Spike Lee, you don't like Donald Trump--P.S. a lot of people don't--but having a scene where a character literally calls Trump a ""Klansman"" while standing up at a table full of people in a bar while holding up his right hand is not even a little bit clever. Spike Lee may as well have broken the 4th wall, inserted a clip of Spike Lee saying ""I hate Donald Trump,"" to the audience and it would have been less cringe-worthy than that scene.The acting is god-awful. Actors are stepping on each others' lines, constantly betraying what their character's objective and emotion is, and very rarely act with any real deliberate movements. Delroy Lindo had played very good roles previously, but Spike Lee clearly did his career no favors with this ""joint"". Delroy Lindo's acting during a scene when he is supposed to be having a PTSD-induced panic attack left me very confused about what was actually going on. Spike Lee clearly did not consult any military or psychology professionals while making this movie. I am not sure if you can even blame Delroy Lindo since it is the director's (Spike Lee) responsibility and duty to say 'hey we missed the mark on this take, let's do it again but we we need to do...instead.' or even 'hey, maybe this PTSD scene in the floating market will be too difficult and expensive to pull off, let's rewrite the scene to when we are on land and where it is cheaper.'The only redeeming quality of the movie was the few little snippets of information about black history. I have seen better movies made by college film undergrads than this movie. If anything this movie was rushed to screen during the most recent protests as Netflix's sad attempt to virtue signal and gain more subscribers. Ultimately, this movie will go down as Spike Lee's worst movie. How he went from BlackKklansman to this is beyond me.",Da 5 Bloods

The changing aspect ratio was a nice touch but I feel like this was an after thought as much of the framing felt off and was awfully wide for what felt like no reason.The editing was rather lacklustre and felt like a soap opera.I can see why this film is being praised due to its messages of inequality and awful treatment of African Americans throughout all of americas history. I would've appreciated these messages if they weren't served to me with a spoon.I feel like the filmmakers in the editing room said ""apocalypse now was a great Vietnam war film.

Patchy plotting, sub standard production quality and shoddy direction keeps viewers from caring much anyway. As a 'Vietnam War Film"" it fails due to its unconvincing set up of period scenes. As a memoir it does little justice by portraying the present Vietnam nation with a dishonest ""Hollywood"" eye. There are no child beggars in HCM night clubs (or any other city) and armed gangs are not found roaming around in the country which has excellent law and order situation.

Apart from that the plot was heavy handed in it's character arcs.. The introduction of Hedy Bouvioure purely so she could show up at a crucial moment miles from where you might expect her to be.

And the woman who plays her daughter, Michon, is in her 40's, so it's obvious you don't know how Asian women age gracefully.
And as far as the story and characters go, well, the story is a good one on the surface but jumps from one incredulous scenario to another and drags on for much too long. I loved the characters initially, but the dialogue didn't do much for the character development and the dialogue was filled with clichés. And the main characters loved each other and then turned on each other in the very next breath, and this went on- back and forth and back and forth- throughout the entire story. Paul's character was off the charts crazy and the others repeatedly rolled over and let him do whatever he wanted- again, unreal and cliché for someone with PTSD, but Delroy Lindo did a great job with what he had. I'm sorry that more time wasn't devoted to the face to face interactions between Paul and David, BTW.
The snake scene was weird, the land mine hunter characters were unnecessary to the story and didn't add anything to it, and I'm not sure how I felt about the characters appearing in flashbacks as their current age, but the history ""slides"" and music should've taken a greater role.

It's a bit of history, politics, economics, humanity, war, hate, love, hope, feelings, family mixed with a hint of a story. I'm sure those will resonate within me for many year to come.

816,gameody-37431,"A Politically-Driven Film that Flows Spontaneously, yet Effectively and Explicitly Displays its Message.",7,30 July 2020,"'Da 5 Bloods' is a 2020 film about a group of four African-American veterans of the Vietnam War, who in a contempary setting head back to the land they fought on fifty years prior. They go to confront their trauma, but mostly to search for the gold their deceased, heroic squad leader ('Stormin' Norman) hid.This film I like due to the explicit action, and with that explicit tones developed throughout. The veterans from the very start are bound for a traumatic experience, with flashbacks to not only their time in the sixties but to the world's violence that erupted then (disturbing images of Capt. Nguyen Van Lem's, and the village of My Lai's deaths are depicted.) One character in particular is very emotional; the Trump-supporting curmudgeon Paul is hostile to the curious Vietnamese people in their return, for example the scene wherein he has a panic attack in anger after refusing the sale of a chicken. Paul is very loose, and we all know that his anger is perpetuated by the trauma of war. He dislikes his son when he asks to split his share of gold with him, and gradually starts to detest him throughout, when he puts the life of hostage Seppo (a volunteer who helps clear landmines) aboves the value of the gold. After the touching, relieving scene of his son David escaping from a landmine, Paul is still focused on the gold. During one of the confrontations with Vietnamese gunmen, David gets shot in the leg. Leaving his injured son behind, Paul flees into the jungle with his gold. The characters are very deeply and well written however; Paul is not an outright bad person - he only suffered from bad, hurrendous experiences; an unjust war (in the film's view) wherein oppressed black people were sent to fight for their oppressors. The characters are so well written and so the build-up to their deaths should be well-executed......However, it's not - and here's where the problem with pacing comes into the film. Take the shocking and surprising gruesome death of Eddie, wherein in the jungle he triggers a landmine. A fellow Blood (or David, I'm not quite sure) comforts his limbless, dying body. This is explicit and moving, however the dialogue and attitudes that follow - for not only the materialistic Paul - do not match this tragic death. The scene of Eddie's death seems to be forgotten in the part of the film.I do really enjoy the scene where David has a jump from a landmine trigger, with help from the group tugging a rope tied around him. The father-son dialogue here shows the true humanity in those scarred in trauma. The tension is brilliant, and I get the notion that it was inspired by the Russian Roulette scenes of 'The Deer Hunter' (1978). Another scene I like - a scene which conveys reason for the trauma - is the wartime shot where the 5 Bloods ambush a group of Viet Cong, as they speak colloquially and normally of family life. The tension is created here too, as we know the men are ordered to essentially kill family members - one of the hellish aspects of war.I understand Spike Lee's motives for his films, but I think in some cases the motives aren't conveyed as well as they should be. He has developed deep characters in exciting situations, yet the decision is made to display (or unsubtly commemorate) the African-American heroes of the past. It works well at the start and ends of the film, because it suits the introductory and conclusive narratives (as well as the haunting footage of the Vietnamese Captain's execution and the Buddhist monk's self-immolation), but does not really work when you constantly show images of lesser-known black heroes in the middle of dialogue (interrupting the usual narrative.) It is respectful, I will admit, but not in the cinematic sense; in the way this, as its type of film, is supposed to flow.Perhaps the film is a little too black-and-white when it comes to politics, particularly in the contemporary way, where the victors of modern-day Earth have not yet been crowned by history. (mightn't be as anti-racist as he Democrat opponents, but the situation today, as sensitive as it may be, is better than that of the sixties, and that is indeed due to the integrity and political strength of the civil rights movement during the time of Vietnam. One could say that pride is needed instead of constant victimhood.) Maybe that's just some bias coming out of me personally, but I do find, for the most part, this film to be a decent depiction of the modern-day pity of war.",Da 5 Bloods

I like the way the screen is framed, the format changes from small screen to tell you things about the past and wide-screen to tell you things about the present and then full screen to focus just on the present. The story focuses on how black people have suffered over the years with racism and discrimination, the movie teaches you with relevant historical characters that have fought for the rights of people.
Now, the bad things. What's going on with the edition? I can't believe that an acknowledged director like Spike Lee has very basic problems of it. Sequences that have no connection at all, one minute all the characters are fighting to try to tie the hands of three ""intruders"", a lot of tension, and one minute later everybody is walking including the ""intruders"" without tied hands, what was the point of that tension. Another problem, long sequences of dialog or monologs that lead to... nowhere. The music score: terrible! drama sequences, action sequences and the music made it feel the same, as if you were watching... Believe ir or not... a Marvel movie.

Since these prolific actors know better, it must be the directing. I sense that this movie may have ""so bad already, it's worth watching"" potential.",Da 5 Bloods
822,gotgetltd,Don't Waste Your Time,1,26 April 2021,Worst movie I've seen in a minute. You are better off rewatching something you've seen a million times than to waste two and a half hours on this. Absolutely terrible.,Da 5 Bloods
823,gjaffe-79469,Mind-blowingly bad,1,13 December 2020,Never have I ever heard such universally good things about a movie only to watch it and be utterly disappointed. And it's not just that it didn't live up to expectations. This is unequivocally a bad movie. The acting wasn't terrible but everything else was a shambles to put it mildly.,Da 5 Bloods
824,ahmedawy-74681,Americans are hypocrites!!,8,13 June 2020,"I just finished this movie , which i like a lot because its true , a lot these early negative reviews on how the movie looks like a PowerPoint presentation or how it is stretched and it should be shorter but i think these are not the main reason , i think it is because this movie show you the truth , americans always enjoy a good war movie about Killing the nazis and liberating france etc... but when they get to see their own country truth , about war crimes and racism they would call it a powerpoint presentation sadly!",Da 5 Bloods
