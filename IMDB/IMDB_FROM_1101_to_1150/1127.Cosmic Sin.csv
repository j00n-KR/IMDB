0,MartinHafer,"I think they spent all the budget on Bruce Willis and had nothing left for writing, props, actors and more.",3,17 October 2021,"I noticed that ""Cosmic Sin"" recently made it to IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list and has a pitiful score of only 2.5! So, not only is it on the list...but it is way up the list at #39!When I first started watching this sci-fi film, I could IMMEDIATELY see why the film is so hated. It's a film set in the 26th century and at this time, there is space travel and life on many planets and moons. So, why do you see folks driving pickup trucks that look like they are from 2021? Why are the clothes pretty much what you'd see today and why are most of the weapons not much more effective or different than today's?! It honestly looks like they must have spend all their budget on securing Bruce Willis' talents and had nothing left to make it look like a futuristic story. Now I don't think you need expensive props to make a good film...but this is ridiculous and really takes you out of the story.The story begins with some form of life being discovered on some new planet. It seems that up until this time, humans have never made first contact with any intelligent species...even with humans inhabiting many new worlds. As you'd expect, this new form of sentient life is not sweet and friendly....as who would want to see a film like that?! And, it turns out that it is so deadly that in the entire galaxy (numbering many, many, many billions) the only guy that can stop the creatures is a war criminal, James Ford (Willis)!I have seen much worse films that never made it to the IMDB list...mostly because they are older, cheaper and more obscure. In other words, the Bottom 100 is very heavily skewed to new films...so although the film is bad, it's not the 39th worst film ever made! I think it's just that a lot of folks get Netflix and had a chance to see it...whereas far less folks have seen the films of Ed Wood, Al Adamson, Ray Dennis Steckler and William Grefe...all filmmakers who REALLY knew how to make terrible films...REALLY terrible films!So is there anything good about this movie? Some of the CGI space scenes are very nice and would probably look great on the big screen (though I assume this film, when it came out, only went straight to Netflix and Amazon Prime). Otherwise, the story is not especially interesting, the dialog often pretty bad and the acting not especially good. It is not completely awful...just mostly awful. And, unfortunately not so bad that it's fun to watch in order to make fun of the film.By the way, nearly all the reviews for this are extremely negative. With this and a score of 2.5, I am amazed to find some folks giving it 10s! A few admit that it's bad but are just trolling or love it because it's so bad. A few, however, are VERY short reviews that talk about how brilliant it is...a sure sign normally of fake reviews done by folks connected with the film...which is pretty shameful.",Cosmic Sin
1,SnoopyStyle,cinematic sin,3,3 March 2021,"Some 500 years in the future, mankind has spread into the cosmos. On a faraway planet, humans have encountered First Contact. An alien presence infects people and turns them into marauding zombies. James Ford (Bruce Willis) is a disgraced military leader arguing for the doomsday Q-bomb. Engineer Fiona Ardene (Adelaide Kane) is called in to prep the device. General Ryle (Frank Grillo) leads the soldiers while Dr. Lea Goss (Perrey Reeves) is awed by the aliens.First thing first, this movie opens with an info-dump in text form. It's a lot of gobbledygook. Someone should try to read it again. Then there is the awkward mix of present-day technology with the future tech. There is no logical reason for it. It's an obviously sign of bad budgeting and unimaginative set design. When that happens, they are better off putting the movie in a smaller space and as much future tech onto the screen. At least, put some effort in giving the characters some future-cars. Its greater sin is that it's boring. I think I must have spaced out. One moment, they're fighting zombies in the warehouse and the next, they're space-diving to another planet. It's a forgettable muddle.",Cosmic Sin
2,nogodnomasters,Hostiles on the Base,6,13 March 2021,"The Earth looks very much like it does today minus the robot bar tender. Slang terms like ""Secret Squirrel"" is still being used. The character development was light and I had flashbacks to Willis blowing up an asteroid. I understand the lack of love. It is an action film with lots of gun fighting and C.J. Perry. Not the best, but strangely I enjoyed it a bit.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Cosmic Sin
3,classicsoncall,"""Either way this works out, it's gonna be on the wrong side of history.""",5,24 July 2021,"Ah yes, a movie that's finally described by it's own title. This film doesn't require a long review because it's just too disjointed for a coherent story line, what with all those scenes that look like they might be dream sequences or flashbacks to another time and place. They just don't seem to connect to what's going on in the main picture. Sad to say, I was looking for Bruce Willis to break out of his recent string of dismal flicks to really make an impact in this one, but he just looked way tired of the whole thing as Blood General James Ford, the banished soldier who dropped a Q-bomb on planet Zafdie to wipe out seventy million people. All for a good cause of course, because they were on the way to secede from the Alliance with Earth and Ellora. Ford has the film's most prescient bit of dialog, which I've put in my summary line for you. Along with the title, it pretty much says everything you need to know about this sci-fi travesty.",Cosmic Sin
4,paul_haakonsen,What a disappointment this was...,3,20 March 2021,"Granted, I have to admit that I was lured in to watching the 2021 movie ""Cosmic Sin"" given the movie's cover/poster and the fact that the movie was starring Bruce Willis, Frank Grillo and Costas Mandylor.And let me just come right out and say that writers Edward Drake and Corey Large failed to deliver a wholesome movie here with ""Cosmic Sin"". While I managed to sit through the entire ordeal, then I must say that all throughout the course of the entire movie I was sitting with an overwhelming sense of pointlessness. I just couldn't find anything worthwhile in the storyline, and everything seemed just bland and without a cause.It was so difficult to indulge myself into the storyline because it was so linear and anything but interesting and exciting. So the end result that is ""Cosmic Sin"" from director Edward Drake was just a very forgettable and rather mundane movie. The storyline was just so amazingly generic and linear that you could have left the movie for a longer period of time, and returned only to be right up to speed with the storyline.Now, I am sure that die-hard fans - pardon the pun - of Bruce Willis or Frank Grillo might actually find some kind of odd enjoyment here in the movie. I, however, didn't. So this movie was a swing and a miss.I must admit that it felt that Bruce Willis wasn't really committed to this movie project, and his performance felt half-hearted, as if he was running on auto-pilot. And Frank Grillo just wasn't given enough on-screen time to manage to do much of anything to salvage the movie.The characters in the movie were every bit as bland and pointless as the storyline. So you don't really connect with any of them, nor do you form any kind of attachments to any of them. So whether they live or die, it hardly matters.Now, what did work for ""Cosmic Sin"" was the visuals. They had some nice enough suits for the soldiers of the Alliance. And the weapon effects were quite good. The aliens, however, they just felt like something out of a B movie. So that was disappointing to say the least.All in all, ""Cosmic Sin"" was exactly what the movie title says; a cosmic sin. This movie came and went without leaving much of any blast mark or memorable impression. My rating of ""Cosmic Sin"" lands on a mere three out of ten stars.",Cosmic Sin
5,Calicodreamin,What was this even about?,2,17 July 2021,"A terribly written trash heap that made no sense, the storyline was disjointed to say the least. The effects were okay. But what good there was is overshadowed by poor acting and bad dialogue. Almost laughably bad.",Cosmic Sin
6,bombersflyup,Bad.,1,5 March 2021,"Cosmic Sin is goofy, with thriller dance, tower defense, nonsense. Bad characters, intangible silly plot, yawn end please.",Cosmic Sin
7,deloudelouvain,Low ratings are in this case completely justified.,3,7 March 2021,"Bruce Willis is becoming the new Nicholas Cage. It looks like he's just accepting any role without reading the script, something Nicholas Cage seems to do as well. Not that I think Bruce Willis is a great actor, he just played in some good movies, but he's not a great actor, and lately he's been actually really bad. It's going downhill for Bruce Willis. Cosmic Sin is just bad, with a story that is badly written, special effects that looked from another century, and actors that don't seem to know what they're doing. I wish I could unwatch this piece of garbage.",Cosmic Sin
8,siderite,It was simply awful,3,2 March 2021,"Bruce Willis stopped telegraphing his acting for this film. He just didn't act at all. I mean, it looked like he was between high and mentally disabled. I worry about the dude. Then Frank Grillo, happenstance makes that I have seen three of his films this week, I was just saying how I wish he would get a break. Not for this film! Note that he is billed first, above Willis, and his role is at most 15 minutes from the film anyway.But what makes this film shine like a black hole is the story. It felt more than devoid of passion, like a spreadsheet that sucks one's soul away in the accounting department on a hot day after the air conditioning died. I mean, if a kid would have written it, it at least would have been fun. If someone was incompetent it would have felt like trying to send some kind of message, however badly. But no, it ... just made no sense, like someone hated writing for this film.Bottom line: it is so bad you can't even enjoy it wasted. It's a non-movie. It's like what's on the other side of the event horizon of TV static.",Cosmic Sin
9,tabuno,A Faint Potential For A Engaging Sci Fi Movie Falls To Poor Writing and Execution,3,10 August 2021,"In Cosmic Sin the 26th Century still using way outdated hand weapons (eventually even a grenade) and pick-up trucks and honking vehicles on a street and parked motorcycles and even cigarettes indistinguishable from the 1960s. The Nostromo from the Alien (1979) had a way much better med unit. Early scenes after the good and bad introductory mystery have of course the requisite robotic servers and hologram (country?) singers and a barfight with a slight difference with again the old-fashioned side arms and the Calvary with an attempt at twinge of an alternative outcome that really is not.There are major storyline problems with the quarantine procedures even simple glass windows and even a typical ""gun"" fight, yet there was an initial attempt at fascinating underlying dynamic taking place however with the first contact encounter scenes and subsequent reflective commentary. Then somehow a brief firefight does not flow well, problems with editing arise, a scene very underdeveloped, and supposedly a well-manned defensive team becomes at risk of being actually overrun. Instead of a quickening climatic pace, the energy seems to dissipate and slow down along with almost no high-tech, futuristic surveillance networks to warn of impending attacks becomes more combat scenes from a mediocre World War II movie with elements from Stargate (1994) and worse yet the climatic battle is something that would be more like out of a World War I engagement and lame hand to hand sequences and a limp effort a riveting emotional end. The screenwriters were definitely not up the job and no actor could improve on a thin script that had the promise but not the actual substance to translate into a credible movie. This movie even reverted to absolutely unnecessary cowboy, western era musical harmonics while Bruce Willis strangely just seems to fade almost completely away by the end of the movie.The major problem with Cosmic Sin lies with the screenwriters trying too hard to be cute and offer up something substance, different, and try to incorporate too many fancy relational and philosophical ideas. They failed in their execution and omitted too many important backstories to offer audiences a sense of plot flow. Instead the audience is sort of just dropped into this movie without the understanding of what the real motives of what is going on. The audience is forced to play catch up. The writers fall into their own traps with the only way out of empty ideas is to create overly convenient ways to extricate themselves out of various corners (i.e., where a general loses face for backing down on his own orders, the awkward political dynamics of the military decisions being made, past undisclosed relationships).Maybe the only nice surprise of this movie is the character and what some people might call a cameo performance of Lochlyn Munro. He appears to have finally broken out of his typecast of either simple bad guy or side character in a slew of romantic comedies. Munro had a decent performance here.",Cosmic Sin
10,The-Sarkologist,Really Not Worth the Effort,1,17 March 2021,"I sort of wonder whether there is a minimum word count for IMDB reviews, but then again I suspect there isn't if the number of reviews that appear that simply say 'I created an account to give this movie one star' is anything to go by. Mind you, those reviews generally don't tell me all that much, though the star rating generally does go to help the final score, not that this tells me anything these days with the number of single review accounts that seem to appear with all of the movies these days.However, this movie definitely deserves one star - it is bad - really, really bad. Okay, I was pretty tired when I watched this film, and found it rather difficult to follow, and normally that would suggest that maybe I should watch this film again. However, this film literally have the lowest rating that I have seen of any film on IMDB - and that is definitely saying something. It sounds as if nobody who watched the film enjoyed it. In fact, nobody has even bothered to write a synopsis on Wikipedia.What is it about? Honestly, I'm not all that sure. Is it an alien invasion that the people of Earth have to stop, or are they zombies trying to take over the Earth, and the people of Earth have to stop them. Yeah, it is pretty confusing, and doesn't seem to really have a coherent plot. Also, what is this thing about going out and destroying the aliens before they can, well, take over the Earth? That doesn't seem to be the type of thing that we should be advocating.Yeah, this film was incredibly painful to watch, and I really couldn't wait for it to be over. Sure, I could have simply walked out of the cinema, but I really don't like doing that - at all. I pretty much like to hang around until the end. Sure, I might watch it again if it appears on Netflix, but then again with all of the other films out there that I could be wasting my time watching, this one isn't going to be high on my list.",Cosmic Sin
11,cruise01,Horrible,2,29 April 2021,1 out of 5 stars.Cosmic Sin is a horrible science fiction action film. The cast ensemble performances are horrible and phoned in. Looking for an easy paycheck. The visual effects are terrible. The action is boring. The story is terrible. The script and direction is terribly put together.,Cosmic Sin
12,imseeg,I am a huge scifi and Bruce Willis fan. BUT...this scifi movie looks ridiculous and Bruce Willis is only present due to contractual obligations...,3,27 March 2021,"I AM (was) A BRUCE WILLIS FAN.BUT....this movie is a stinker, a fraud. It is simply NOT anything near a scifi movie. It is just another contractual obligation for Bruce Willis, so he can pay his bills for 15 minutes of acting...The only one that is gonna be happy is the producer of this movie, because he knows that many, MANY people will watch it, based on the sole appearance of Bruce Willis. Too bad, this movie s8(!ks...The ""story"": .....",Cosmic Sin
13,subxerogravity,Can't justify anyone seeing this movie.,3,18 July 2021,"Bruce Willis does this sometimes, it's one of those cheap flicks in which they spend a lot of money to have Mr. Willis spend 10,mins in the movie so they can put him on the poster and say Bruce Willis is in the movie, so that...Die Hard fans like myself will check it out.I'm hip to the con and sometimes it leads to a good movie. In this case I at least thought I would get Frank Grillo as the actual star of the movie but as it turns out he's also phoning this one with Willis. Guest he can do that after making that money In the Marvel Cinematic Universe flicks.The movie has a complex plot about survival of the fittest on an interstellar level, which was pretty much wrapped up in the trailer of the film and never really goes any further.I would love to tell you how action packed this film is but that falls short as well. It feels set up to be fluffed with action but its all lame .The only thing I truly got a kick out of was the cheap Sci-fi. You could tell they were trying to turn 20 bucks into 200 million, but sometimes those failures can give a movie charm. They had some visual effects scenes that were filmed perfectly and some of the costumes were so stylish i could not keep my eyes off of them (Making it easier to see all their flaws)If you want a really good Bruce Willis is just on the poster movie checkout Extraction, it's perfect. I would leave this one alone.",Cosmic Sin
14,DarkVulcan29,Bruce Willis and Frank Grillo can do much better.,4,23 July 2021,"The premise has been done in other horror sci -fi films that where much better than this, I'm sure we remember Aliens(1979), hardly anybody here grabs your interest, even the Bruce Willis character who looks barely awake through out most of this, looking like he hasn't slept since Glass(2019), appears he did this movie for a pay check, other than that he looks very bored through this whole thing.Now the effects are pretty descent, and Frank Grillo and Costas Mandylor seem to be only actors giving it there all, cause neither one appear to be sleepwalking through this, even though both probably know this film is gonna be bad, but glad to say the both where being professional. But the film seems edit down, not giving enough time for anything for the plot to evolve.",Cosmic Sin
15,stevendbeard,Bad 'B' Sci-fi,4,13 March 2021,"I saw ""Cosmic Sin"", starring Frank Grillo-the Purge movies, Captain America:The Winter Soldier; Bruce Willis-Breach, Glass; Costas Mandylor-Born Champion, the Saw movies and Perrey Reeves-Old School, Child's Play 3.
This is a bad 'B' sci_fi movie with Bruce Willis getting second billing-you know there is something wrong there. He just recently made another cheap sci_fi movie, Breach, so I guess he must like them-either that or maybe he owes somebody money or a favor. Anyway, this one takes place in 2524, when the earth has colonized some other planets, some of which were inhabited. Bruce was a war hero-he killed a bunch of aliens-but some people didn't like the way he did it, so he was discharged unceremoniously. Some aliens attack a group of earth people on a remote survey planet and Frank-a general-calls in Bruce to do what Bruce likes doing; putting the aliens in their place. Costas is a Sargent in the squad that is assembled and Perrey is a doctor/former love interest to Bruce. Some of the story is a little jumbled and hard to make sense of at times-the aliens are wearing long blazers with hoodies to probably hide the low budget. There are even times when it's hard to tell exactly who the good guys are-the humans or the aliens. Of course, that might have been the producers objective in the first place; to have a debate on war.
It's rated ""R"" for violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 28 minutes.
I like bad movies-at times-but they do need a coherent storyline, at least. I wouldn't buy this on DVD. I wouldn't rent it either. If you really want to see it, I would wait until it shows up on cable.",Cosmic Sin
16,kwenchow,"Another worst action film! Full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Avoid at all cost!",1,5 March 2021,"This film start with a man with armor ""James"" landing on the ground, and two people kissing scene! As turnout, this film is about James need to team up with Ryle to defeat the alien colony in planet ""Ellora"" to save earth! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the calling names scene, overuse of the drinking scene, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the monitoring scene, overuse of the flashbacks scene, and overuse of the arguing scene! Make the film unwatchable! All the shooting scene have blood at certain point, but overall portray by sideways, messy, have slow motion, and just hear the gunshot sound! Make the film frustrated to watch! The only intensity of the film is the explosion scene! At the end, Ryle sacrifice himself to save earth! That's it! Wasting time to watch!",Cosmic Sin
17,jimbo-53-186511,Far from cosmic; the true sin has been committed by those that produced and worst still green lit this film!!,1,15 May 2021,"When a small group of soliders on a remote planet are attacked by a mysterious alien civilisation another team of soliders headed up by disgraced retired General James Ford must work together and bring the fight to the aliens before they destroy Earth and the various other civilisations...I'm really starting to get sick of Sky Movies and their misleading ratings for films; 4 stars out of 5 this rubbish got from them (so 8 out of 10 on the IMDB scale). After I watched the film I decided to look at its IMDB rating to see what others thought of the film and was relieved to see that I wasn't alone in thinking this was a stinker (it's current rating of 2.5 out of 10 speaks for itself).Although many other people will have doubtlessly explained the many flaws with this film I may as well throw my hat in the ring and give my two penneth...For a start, despite the film only running for around 85-90 minutes it is excruciatingly slow with a practically non-existent storyline; I mean there's no real definitive explanation for what the aliens wanted and why they were attacking these civilisations in the first place? At one point it's mentioned that the aliens don't believe that they can co-exist with other civilisations and therefore effectively rather than destroy the people within the civilisations. They embody the people and use them as hosts to continue their destruction (effectively creating an army). This is summed up in about 30 seconds of dialogue and isn't eluded to again. To say this film lacks depth would be an understatement!!!Still shallow sci-fi isn't always bad, but if you're not going to give your audience a deep and involving story then it's usually a good idea to provide a shedload of action, sharp dialogue, interesting characters and a sense of fun. OK it's asking a lot to see all 4 elements, but even 1 or 2 of these things may have made the film just about bearable, but honestly the film is so colourless and so devoid of personality that it becomes a challenge just to sit through it.The acting is pretty poor as well; Bruce Willis isn't the best actor in the world, but he has appeared in a lot of good films meaning that if he is working with the right director and screenwriter they know this and will play to his strengths. To be honest though, given how bad this film was I think Bruce knew he was starring in a turkey and simply didn't care and therefore put no effort in at all. Everyone else is no better with many of the cast reciting their dialogue in an emotionless manner as though they were reading from an autocue. Oh and by the way guys you're meant to be soldiers so something in the way of camaraderie wouldn't have gone a miss.Believe its abysmal IMDB rating and the 1 or 2 star reviews, save 90 minutes of your life and just skip this rubbish.",Cosmic Sin
18,lukem-52760,ANOTHER CHEAP 'N' CHEESY SCI-FI B-MOVIE WITH WILLIS!!!,6,2 March 2021,"EDWARD DRAKE who directed this very low-budget t.v series like Sci-fi Thriller also had written it & also had written the other Bruce Willis Sci-fi Cheapy ANTI-LIFE (2021) also & that explains why both films are so similar & i thought that as I watching it, i actually said to my wife that Willis must've gotten Deya Vu making this!!!
I actually liked ANTI-LIFE better of the two but to be honest they do make a chilled evening of a Double Bill of Willis Sci-fi Thriller's.
Now COSMIC SIN is set like it's other half of the Double bill, in the future but this time the world isn't destroyed but just very futuristic (with what the small budget could do) with flying cars/vehicles as well as normal cars too still & robots for a barman in the bars (Similar to Will Smith's i,Robot 2004) & lots of glowing Neon lights & things & for the most part it looks good!!! Yes it's very low-budget but i gotta admit i was impressed with alot of the look & technology they pulled off with cheap c.g.i & practical effects & the basic story is our planet has finally made contact with Alien creatures but they're hostile & when a team return from another planet that they've been stationed on, they come back possessed just like in it's close brother ANTI-LIFE & start killing everyone in the station base & here we get our team of soon-to-be heroes with the rugged old infamous ex-Commander Bruce Willis known as a warmonger due to his brutal past & it's just nice having the old skool Action legend here in such a low-budget production, even if he's only here for the paycheck!!! Willis plays his part like most these days with a calmness & a Coolness & a bad attitude just like he did in Anti-life & many other of his DTV films but i like him here & just by having him lifts its quality.
We also get the great B-movie legend FRANK GRILLO who i have loved since THE PURGE: ANARCHY & his Cool, rugged & no-nonsense toughness is on display again in a leader role but to be honest he doesn't get to do the action i expected & wanted but again it's great to have the veteran side by side with Willis.
There's a few other familiar faces but it's these two stars is why i wanted to even watch this.I will say this though that i would rather watch this flick or Anti-life over any of the ridiculously mega budget TRANSFORMERS films & more so than many of the over-blown budget trash that is put on the Cinema, Cosmic Sin is small scale but crams in a fun little Sci-fi action story with a Cool Willis leading it all even if he's not exactly giving it his all, still miles better than the usual Steven Seagal DTV flick.
Small minimalist budget yes but i see alot of creativity went into creating the look & it's futuristic technology & it does look Good for it's budget!!!
At times i got the feel & vibe of a POWER RANGERS episode or movie, especially when they gear up with body armour suits & when they fight the Alien beings (that seem like possessed humans as you Don't ever see their faces or what they really are) the villains come accross as the type that the Power Rangers would battle but hey it's a Low-budget slice of Sci-fi Thriller cheese so i just took it for that.
Our team are power boosted through space & land on another planet that is fine for Humans & the rest of the Cheese fest plays on the forest planet with rebels (like STAR WARS) & the action is fine for a cheap flick with laser guns & possessed warriors that also reminded of John Carpenter's Ghost's of Mars just like ANTI-LIFE did too!!!! Many Sci-fi flicks enfluenced this as did ANTI-LIFE & like i said both written by Edward Drake but only this one was directed by him.Cosmic Sin just like Anti-life is a cheap, trashy & cheesy but fun B-movie that's nothing special or great but an easy watch & does make a nice Double bill with ANTI-LIFE. Entertaining & fun.",Cosmic Sin

20,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Cosmic Sin,4,28 April 2021,"""It takes a monster to kill a monster"". Guess what. It takes a miracle to believe that 2021's Cosmic Sin would be viable, sci-fi fare. By the way, Neil Blomkamp called and says he wants his lauded integrity back.So yeah, ""Sin"" was released in March of this year (its title in India is actually Worthless Rip-Off). It's a direct-to-video flick that also poses as something you'd see on well, the Syfy channel. Cosmic Sin tries to be part Blade Runner, part Ghosts of Mars, part Elysium, and part Aliens. Sadly with its characters bickering back and forth like the Bickersons, ""Sin"" feels more like 2000's veritable bomb, Supernova.Cosmic Sin is poorly lit in a soft bulb sort of way. It also has action scenes that are choppily edited, actresses you feel sorry for (I'm talking about you Perrey Reeves), and a script that contains enough sci-fi mumbo jumbo to denounce any normal ritual. Bruce Willis stars in ""Sin"" and you know what that means. Aside from unloading a rifle, projecting his last shred of screen presence, and looking like Iron Man without full headgear, Brucie appears like he's in a coma with no chance of reverse stupor.Taking place in the year 2524 (that's random) and directed by Australian Edward Drake, Cosmic Sin is basically about Gen. James Ford (Bruce Willis) trying to stop a fleet of aliens that I guess look like humans. Willis doesn't do or say much but hey, he's Bruce ""I used to be a beast"" Willis. He probably got paid by the line (or any catatonic facial expression).Bottom line: Any way you cut it, I probably should've avoided watching Cosmic Sin. Its intentions are good considering but come on, it's more like ""cosmic"" debris (no pun intended for the late Frank Zappa). Forgive me for I have ""sinned"".",Cosmic Sin
21,elliotjeory,It's not that bad,6,7 May 2021,"It's a low budget sci-fi film but it has an excellent cast and I liked some of the scenes, I think they did well with the low budget and it was a lot better than the other Bruce Willis sci-fi anti-life.",Cosmic Sin

23,IonicBreezeMachine,"Were this a no budget film released on YouTube by some students for free I'd recommend it, but as a product by a professional studio with Bruce Willis in the lead it's trash.",2,10 August 2021,"In the year 2524 an Earth colony has first contact with a hostile alien race. General Ryle (Frank Grillo) enlists disgraced ""Blood General"" James Ford (Bruce Willis) who was infamous for his use of a Q-Bomb that killed 70 Million people. Ryle enlists Ford to lead an off the books team to eliminate the alien threat before they're aloud to spread through the galaxy.Reteaming with Edward Drake and Corey Large of fellow DtV Willis sci-fi film Breach, Cosmic Sin looks and feels like it's from the same filmmakers to the point they almost feel like entries in their own ""universe"". Instead of aping Alien or The Thing like Breach, Cosmic Sin is more in line with sci-fi action like Aliens or Edge of Tomorrow. In a way I suppose Cosmic Sin is a marginal improvement on Breach, but in other ways with a larger scale story and a similar production budget, it feels noticeably cheaper than Breach as well.Much like Breach the movie doesn't feel like it takes place in the future. At least with Breach once they were on the ship they at least had proper uniforms that fit with the situation, but in Cosmic Sin everything feels like it's straight from today save for some CGI establishing shots of spaceships and some ""armor""(we'll get to that). It's clear the movie's reach far exceeds it's grasp with the ""high tech military facility"" using the same tricks as breach to make it look futuristic with harsh multicolored lighting and poorly integrated hologram effects. But the filmmakers luckily decided to give us some locational variety with their shoot....the woods! All of the colony scenes (save for one scene with a tent) take place in the woods and have the same feeling of rushed and economic one would expect to see in a LARP straight out of Role Models. The armor the characters wear in the second half of the movie makes no sense as the script says it's approved for ""quantum combat""(whatever that's supposed to be) and with open faced helmets and massive bare patches there's no thought or care as to how these cheap bulky monstrosities function in combat or space.Outside of the bare bones production values, the movie's script is a hodgepodge of pretty much every other sci-fi film/video game you've seen(and a few you haven't) with the likes of the 2009 Star Trek, Stargate, Edge of Tomorrow, Screamers, Gears of War, Aliens, and even Ghosts of Mars. The movie's script also tries to address ""ethical issues"" in quite possibly the most ill fitting approach since 2005's Stealth tried to analyze the moral issues of unmanned drone warfare. Willis' ""Blood General"" James Ford is so named because he quelled an separatist rebellion by dropping a Q-bomb killing 70 million people. The movie is strangely uncritical about this character with many of the supporting cast spouting things about how Ford got a ""Raw Deal"", ""It's harder to give orders than follow them"", ""you need monsters to beat monsters"", and it's the kind of mindset that many villains use for justification in many films of this ilk that makes the film feel fundamentally confused. Not that the story will draw most people in as it's poorly delivered with bad camera work, poorly staged sequences, and sleepy performances from uninterested actors with Bruce Willis' voice never even breaking an octave.Cosmic Sin continues Bruce Willis' disappointing DtV streak with an embarrassing cheap sci-fi rehash that is put to shame by amateurly made fan productions. With a sloppy production, cut and paste script, and uninterested performances that leave the movie inert and dull the movie will give you the odd laugh or smirk from point out its stolen ideas and concepts, but aside from that it's yet another cheap dud from a once respectable actor.",Cosmic Sin
24,kuarinofu,Unwatchable,1,13 March 2021,"This film is just a mess. I hope that the intention behind this was to make some easy cash.
Otherwise, I just can't explain why would anyone get involved in this.There are outlines of a story, but not like an actual screenplay. The time setting makes no sense, the WORLD BUILDING that is done through on-screen text doesn't seem to mean anything. The science is messed up beyond even the lowest fiction standards of science fiction. I think I had a general understanding of what was supposed to be going on, but I'm not sure.At times it felt almost like a bad parody, and I hope they were just trolling the viewers with just how much they can get away with.It looks like a fan film shot on a good camera with good actors but nobody cared one bit.I can't really bash on the actors, everyone needs some cash, there were a couple of recognizable faces like Frank Grillo (who isn't a pro actor, but he's always likable), Lochlyn Munro, even Costas Mandylor from the Saw series...this is just...bizarre.Willis delivered his basic nearly-coma performance which he does in most of his fast paycheck-oriented films now, and he made sure that the contract mentioned him in the script as an ultimate badass. His appearance was obviously agreed on only to have his face mentioned in the promotion materials.I usually endorse low-budget sci-fi when I see a spark of an idea or actual care put into one.

27,0w0,A terrible movie... Bruce should fire his agent,3,7 March 2021,"From the first 30seconds of the movie, I already knew this movie was going to be trash, but I didn't realize just HOW trash it was going to be. This is a 3rd-rate movie that hitched their ENTIRE wagon onto Bruce Willis' name... without him nobody would even have bothered streaming this movie, nevermind watching it at the theatres.This movie HAS TO have had a budget below $15mil..... it would be an absolute travesty if they spent anything more than that on this terrible movie. And I'm sorry but if you're going to attempt to make a 'sci-fi space epic adventure film' on a budget of $15mil or less then you're just insane. 1 or 2mil probably went to Bruce and that left the rest of the movie with an already shoe-string budget. The CGI is bad. The editing is bad. The majority of the movie takes place in darkness, so they didn't have to spend money on set-pieces. There's an INSANE amount of vignetting, lens flare and vaseline-lens going on as well, which is a huge indicator of a terrible production. Easily 30% of the movie is show with vaseline on the lens, I'm certain of it.There's SO MANY things that this movie COULD have done differently to make it seem like it had a bigger budget. Upgrade (2018) is a FANTASTIC example of how to make a sci-fi film with NO budget. I mean Upgrade (2018) had a $3mil budget which is absolutely insane, and if you watched that movie then you'd know that it certainly didn't seem like a shoe-string budgeted movie. Really the fault comes down on the bad director of this movie and just the whole production team as well (since the editing and framing of this movie is terrible too).This movie has no real redeemable qualities and I'd HIGHLY recommend that you watch something else instead. This movie is literally a waste of time and the only one who probably benefitted from this experience is Bruce Willis since he can walk away with a cool couple million (although I respect him less as an actor because of this movie now).",Cosmic Sin

It delivers what it set out to do. It reminds me of Armageddon (when Bruce Willis was at his peak of Hollywood stardom) & Mission to Mars. This is a personification of a Alzheimer's disease in film form in that is tragic & it will soon be forgotten but for the right reasons: it adds nothing to this genre of films & the idea that aliens are all evil is so generic.

Here's what the makers of this movie would like to tell you:
Bruce Willis and Frank Grillo star in the new epic sci-fi adventure set in the year 2524, four hundred years after humans started colonising the outer planets.
Retired Military General James Ford (Willis) is called back into service after soldiers on a remote planet are attacked by a hostile alien fleet.
The threat against the human race escalates into an inevitable interstellar war. General Ford teams up with General Eron Ryle (Grillo) and a team of elite soldiers in a race to stop the imminent attack before it is too late.Now heres the truth: This is the biggest sack of doggy doo to ever make it to the big screen with name stars like Bruce and Frank.
These guys are just phoning in their performances from another galaxy that doesn't even have 5G.
Their pay checks are only boosting their Superannuation funds and not helping the cause of cinema one bit.
I'm a big Willis and Grillo fan, but guys you should be ashamed.
Instead see Grillo in ""Boss Level"" that's a fun SciFi movie with a sharp sense of humour and remember Bruce from his Die Hard days.
""Cosmic Sin"" director and writer, Edward Drake should also be ashamed.
Rotten Tomatoes are having a field day with his gem.
I believe this is his directorial debut on a major motion picture and mainly hired for his writing, which on this occasion is one of the lamest scripts I've ever heard uttered on the big screen.
Did they not do a table reading before shooting?
The movie was also co-written by Producer, Corey Large, who handles the sidekick role of Dash on screen.
Sidekicks are meant to be funny.
At one point this sexist pig of a character points to a female soldiers' huge phallus type gun and says, ""Candle you handle that?""
To which she replies (cutting him off at the knees figuratively), ""I've had bigger!""
It's supposed to be an Action, Sci Fi, Mystery And Thriller, but it's NOT!
The movie riffs off StarGate science and technology and the space armour is clearly spray painted plastic and awkward.
Bathroom time would be a challenge.
The film features a cosmic cannon which would have been better used to shoot this movie into outer space where it can become the Space Junk it was truly meant to be.
I wanted to walk out, but it was 90 minutes in air-conditioned comfort during a stinking hot March day in Queensland, Australia and besides I had a good supply of popcorn and drink and was curious to see if it could get better.
It didn't!
Launch your own preemptive strike and save your money for some really good films from this genre coming soon to a cinema near you like ""Godzilla vs Kong"".
I only gave this movie ONE star, because the rating system doesn't go to zero!

Having the bloke who looks like Frank Grillo was a great idea (I'm a Frank Grillo fan), as was using a cut-out of Bruce Willis. Special effects are good, even the Bruce Willis cut-out had moving lips.Which brings me to the script. If you find a 'script' in a bin, it's been filed there for a reason. No amount of 'special sauce', extras in bikinis or a high body count will make up for a crap script. Trust me, I saw ""Batman vs Superman"" twice.Special effects are pretty Amiga. Maybe school film club should upgrade? Just a thought.And this film does give you lots of time to think. It does not try to monopolise your attention like ""12 Angry Men"" or ""One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest"". No sir, this film lets you indulge your free-thinking gene. Lots. I even finished my 11-year long Rubik Cube session and completed my tax return.Before I go, let's look at the positives, besides the special effects moving lips on the Bruce Willis cut-out...And that's it.I hope you enjoy your movie.",Cosmic Sin

Maybe hire a costume or set designer. I hope we aren't still wearing jackets from nineteen ninety, going to crappy dive bars to watch crappy hologram garage bands in five centuries.Maybe get a scientist to tell you why you can't launch individuals into the middle of space, fly them through a space laser battle, then crash land them in their space suits onto the surface of another planet.

Hey... if they're all alone, why does he have a machine gun? And why does the gal only get a pistol?

In fairness, maybe that was a metaphor for our nation arguably using its military might more than thought.

The aliens are BAD. /s So KILL THEM. Not exactly Close Encounters.Oh, and this is Stargate rules, not Star Trek.The cliche comic sidekick was good for one or two chuckles. Two, I think.

Bruce Willis should get himself a better agent and stop acting in B-grade movies like this. If he's not careful, he'll follow in the footsteps of Nicholas Cage and Steven Seagal.The movie started out well enough. It built tension and had a unique story - First contact with an alien species. But it went sideways from there. The movie for me had too many holes in the plot. I didn't like the slow-fast-slow-fast-slow pace of the movie. The director for some reason, like to cut into looooong meaningless dialogue that just slowed down the pace of the narrative. If the purpose of these slow parts was to build backstory for the characters, well it didn't work. It was just annoying. I found myself yelling at the screen ""...get a move on already...""SUMMARY: Too many holes in the plot and the narrative, lack-lustre at best. The aliens where 2-dimensional.

I have done since the 80s, but it's usually when you can see passion and effort put into something, even if it's rough around the edges.What makes me not only disappointed but a little sad about movies like Cosmic Sin, is that you can tell most of the people behind it simply didn't care. It's either so cheap that with a name like Bruce Willis it becomes profitable regardless of effort, or it's some kind of tax write-off.Of all the amateur writers and film-makers out there, I'm sure they could have found someone looking for an opportunity to make the best of a low-budget, and see it as an opportunity to make the best small movie they can. The resources are there... A few of the actors in Cosmic Sin are actually not bad, and known from other TV shows and small movie parts, and some of the visual effects actually aren't bad, so it's a shame to see the talents and skills of those people wasted on this dire effort. I suppose at least a couple of the effects people will have something half-decent for their showreel...The scriptwriter/s, director and editor/s should frankly be ashamed of themselves. A low budget does _not_ have to mean a bad film (not this bad, anyway), and when you have an opportunity and squander it like this, you should do the honourable thing and find a new career.

114,imdb-23821,"Not the worst, but pretty bad",2,21 July 2021,"This could be one of the most uninspired movies I've ever seen. The plot goes something like this. Willis' character is supposedly the notorious character who followed orders to release a 'q-bomb' on another planet and killed lots of beings. Suddenly on a planet which is supposed to be uninhanbited, a few members of the ""alliance"" are attacked by an unknown source, believed to be an alien and no one knows for sure. And then, when it becomes apparent that there are problems, grizzled Willis must be brought back one more time to potentially do the dirty deed to protect the world because they think they need to... because it's an alien group.Frank Grillo enters and brings his usual A-game and is fine. He does what he can with his part to at least look interested and try to be convincing. The bit characters are mostly OK with some rough edges. Willis looks tired, annoyed and like he couldn't be more disinterested throughout the film. Even during one of the most ""intense"" parts when he could be destroyed, the camera pans on him and he's got a look of boredom.The problem is that most of the film feels like total filler. Characters use terms you've heard in numerous other space movies to describe stuff that is supposed to be ""space cool"" to make you buy into the fact that wearing spacesuits (and only spacesuits) to travel millions of miles is a good idea. Doesn't quite work.To sum up how poor the dialogue in this film is, one of the characters has problems with the space flight path. So he says ""AI, adjust flight path."" Why would a human need to tell the AI to adjust a flight path? We don't even do that today, and certainly not hundreds of years in the future, which looks a LOT like it does today.So how does the story resolve? Like numerous others you've heard before, just far more talky, which is a very bad thing, and without much of it really making too much sense to be believeable. It's watchable for the laughs but totally pointless.",Cosmic Sin

I didn't watch, however, because of Bruce; I watched it because of Frank Grillo, who has churned out a few lesser known B-movie gems in the past that earned my admiration. Unfortunately, this movie is not one of them. Pairing Bruce and Frank with this movie is like icing a turd, yeah, it looks pretty from a distance, but get close and it still stinks.

116,chrisbrooks-19259,This is NOT a 2.5 rated movie!,7,18 July 2021,"First, I am giving a general rating system below for the idiots who think this is a one. This isn't the best movie ever but if you like SyFy it is a good movie. It is entertaining.I almost didn't watch due to this being rated a 2.5 overall. I mean that rating would make this a steaming piece of garbage, which it is not! I was curious how possibly bad this could be so I watched the first 10 minutes then watched the whole movie. Yes, the special effects aren't that of a 100 million dollar movie but they aren't too bad.Overall this is a good SyFy movie, definitely watchable if this is your genre. Aliens, military, action and a good enough plot with dialog. Better than the movies the SyFy channel puts out themselves. Honestly I would have rated a 6 to 6.5 but since everyone rated so low I rated it a 7. Don't rush to watch it but if you like SyFy and Bruce Willis then a good way to kill some time.I wish you could only rate if there was proof you watched the whole movie or series.I want to make this clear. Here is how ratings should work! Since we can't give a zero an average movie is 5.5. So a 5 is a little below average and a 6 is a little above average. I just jotted these all down so I am sure they could be tweaked.1 Is totally unwatchable. Complete waste of time and money! I want my eyes and time back! These are movies Elvira said no to! Burn all of these as they have zero cinematic quality to anyone!2 - This movie was rejected from the B movie festival. I would not watch again, I would never recommend and I am upset I saw it! The only reason it might do well is people watch these because they are so bad it is funny.3 - This is a B movie and not a good one at that! I was at someone's house and I could not escape. Good date movie so they might like to do something else. ^ ^ Would not recommend and I am upset I watched.4 - Ugh, This wasn't very good. I watched too much so I felt obliged to watch the rest. I am not super happy I put it on! I guess B movies fit in here.5 - Slighty below average. Watchable and okay but would not watch again.6 - Slightly above average. Watchable and a enjoyed a few parts.7 - Good movie. Happy I watched it. Some good parts in it.8 - Amazing movie. I greatly enjoyed this movie! Very happy I watched it!9 - Wow. Not a blockbuster but really enjoyed this! I would tell anyone to watch this awesome movie. I will watch again! Great job!10 - One of the best movies! I would love to see this movie again! I would like to own this. Great piece of cinematic art!",Cosmic Sin

I could go on but its trust me, the whole thing is just appalling.The good. Well, the actual performances from Willis, Grillo are pretty good. They've not phoned in their exploits here, but put some effort into good performances. However, in the grand scheme of things it makes little difference. Aside from the aforementioned, Lee, and maybe a couple others, the rest of the cast is really below par and suitably in line with the rest of the already poor production.The only thing this film needs is Nick Cage in his current professional guise to finish it off.I assure you, 2/10 is a very fair score.",Cosmic Sin

120,NotAFilmCritic101001,Cosmic waste of time.,1,3 March 2021,"Bruce Willis stopped caring ages ago, he's here to collect a cheque while doing the least amount of work possible. He's acting like he doesn't care, and it shows, from his very first scene he looks bored and that never changes. The problem with Bruce's approach of not caring is this; if he doesn't care, why should we?Frank Grillo's always going to be a B-grade actor because he takes what he gets. I can imagine he turns down proper dumpster fire scripts on occasion, but for the most part I'd say he's in it for the cash. Although, he's hardly in this film.With those two being the main characters, I immediately knew it wasn't going to be a good movie. The story line is boring & nonsensical, the actors are bad to middling at best. The writer can't even properly weave exposition into natural conversations or set pieces. Here's an example:The scene opens with 'Guy 1' walking by someone smoking.Guy 1: No smoking behind the wire, specialist!Guy2: Yes, sir.Guy 1: I don't give a damn if your uncle is our boss or not.LMAO! The writer couldn't even be bothered to come up with a decent way to let us know this character (in my example 'Guy 2') was the nephew of their boss. Who wrote this dialogue?! This happens numerous times, why is it so bad?! Worst of all, Guy 2 later confronts his uncle to ask if he can join the war, he even goes on to say, ""you would send them off to war, but you wouldn't send your own family?"" lol why the heck didn't you leave it there? There was no need for the initial exposition if you were going to drop it in a scene later. OMG!Okay, there are plenty of instances of that happening, so I won't harp on it. Let's get back to Bruce. So, at the (roughly) 25-minute mark there's a scene between the main-ish characters - Willis, Grillo and a third person are all there. Each one is playing a high ranking official, but Bruce Willis is clearly not in that scene, he doesn't look like he's responding to them, he nods in their general direction as if he's in the room with them, but you can clearly see he's not there with them, they do no wide-angle shots... until they do! And when they do, it's a stand-in for Bruce LMAO it's clearly not him. It's so obvious! Their heads look very different! This happens several times throughout the movie, imagine paying an actor to act and they just go, ""Nope! But he looks like me, so...."" LMAO!Ladies & gents I could go on for a day and a half but let me stop here and say this... This movie sucks! any chance it had at being a movie (not even a good one, just 'a movie') was killed when Bruce Willis was brought on. I recommend you avoid. Don't waste your time.

126,heath-jeffrey,What went wrong,4,19 October 2021,"It seems like there's a great story buried somewhere here, there are some actors we know can be good, and the special effects are mostly quite decent. But it just doesn't work.Hard to say exactly what went wrong, but the three I think might be key reasons:* The camera shots are frequently messed up. Sometimes you know something's supposed to be happening, but between awkward angles, blur effects, and darkness, you don't know what they're trying to show you. Other times you know what they're trying to show you because half the scene gets it across, but another half doesn't match: like a shot with a main character staring out at the enemy, a cut to show enemies dying, back to the character now in close up even with some gun flashes, back to more enemies dying - but the character isn't actually holding up his gun.* There's no character development, yet key scenes are built around the assumption that there is. You're clearly supposed to feel empathy for the decisions they have to make, but you've never had a chance to build up any affinity with them in the first place. Not to mention they're all antagonistic towards each other, and yet in the end you're given the impression they've developed close bonds.* It can't decide what it wants to be. It's hyper futuristic in one case (their spacesuits border on high fantasy magic), while very mundane in others (a pretty standard pistol; no face protection on their suits, and some fist fights). It tries to be stylish (the Tarantino or Keanu kind) in some places, but attempts to be more grounded and dramatic (like Armageddon or The Day After Tomorrow) in others, completely failing at both. Sometimes it borderlines on arthouse, but isn't.Oh, and there are multiple hints at potential plot developments that go nowhere. Are they intentional red herrings? We'll never know, because the acting was so poor you don't know if some implications were accidental. Either way, any of those red herrings panning out would have made for a more interesting plot.Maybe one day there'll be a reboot that makes it all work.",Cosmic Sin

The mismatch of technological advances is ludicrous, with rifles with ammo alongside lasers, and gas vehicles with wormhole jumps.Absurd beyond believe, there is a pocket sized weapon capable of destroying an entire solar system. Unstable, it can't be rattled and can be activated if dropped. The encasing of this technological marvel of 500 years into the future? A glass cylinder.

The highly recognizable and capable talent pool is obviously there, but a poorly crafted script, almost nonexistent production values and bad direction makes everyone and everything appear utterly amateurish. The cinematography is OK, but there's minimal green screen usage. It's as if they intentionally spent absolutely as little as possible on sets and props; literally a shoe string budget.

Again, the feeling that scenes were left unfilmed, or edited out completely.The effects are passable.

And that's the theme of the whole movie, there is barely anything that relies on those 500 years, I could just have been 20 and it would be the same. The story is even worse, an attack on another planet, you immediately get some The Expanse vibes like the attack on Ganymede, but nope they just fly to another planet and then even have hand-2-hand combat with an alien, it's just so confusing and completely unreal.

Really?!Apart from the distinct lack of a ""Phased plasma rifle with a 40-watt range"", this film has some enjoyable moments, such as Bruce Willis being his usual cool collected self during a bar fight. But the film says nothing. No soul, no real drama. I wanted to be on the edge of my seat having looked at the premise... I sincerely have had more tension and drama on the edge of my toilet seat than when I was watching this movie.Once the aliens appear then it goes full pelt into an alien-zombie type battle that is somewhat reminiscent of James Cameron's ""Aliens"" from 1986. The cinematography also is worth noting in its a throwback to ""Blade Runner"" at times, but these are rare and the body of the film looks good and reasonable, but nothing creatively new.Rather long-winded and somewhat boring sequences ensue, some with potentially romantic undertones, along with recollections of past war wounds and pathetic sentimental dialogue that smacks of being added as an afterthought once a first edit was screened, the studio realising the movie has no emotion. Which it still doesn't.Some of it is fun, the special effects although I usually hate CGI are passable, but the lack of humanity and drama, unfortunately, makes the film fail on an emotional level, where it really could have been something that excels.As I have said it also fails miserably on a dramatic level... they just phoned it all in. What a waste of money this was.""Die Hard"" managed to pack in more drama and emotion, it's a shame that Bruce Willis and filmmakers of today don't seem to be capable or even willing to endeavour to achieve anything that even remotely compares. 2/10.",Cosmic Sin

A special mention goes to Mega Boobs In Armor With Yellow Braids, but overall the promise falls flat.My guess is that the little girl popping out of nowhere is actually the illegitimate child Bruce had with the Queen of the aliens, which he meets in a cave, where they both get high.

Shabby men in shabby bars and basements are generals that decide to initiate the first contact with aliens by blasting them away with a q-bomb. The dialog is completely non-sensical. A bunch of amateurs on You Tube would have made a better movie.

I swear most action movies since the 2000's are solely based on getting the camera as close and shaky as possible to disorient the viewer.Creating convincing action scenes doesn't require CGI every time, all the time. Believe it or not, some of the most loved movies of all time had wide camera angles that didn't change every 0.3 seconds. Like Die Hard...Bruce Willis already did 5th Element. Unless you wanted to try to beat it, this is a waste of time. To involve him and make him the prime poster cover when really he's just a cameo most of the movie, is poor salesmanship. You would have been better to try a Fifth Element 2 than this Jason X meets Riddick.The directing was just awful, the lines were COMPLETELY unbelieveable from the start.

The ""futuristic"" armor pieces are almost comically ill-fitting and awkward but have enough detail to make it tolerable. Combat is rather non-sensical, they clearly did whatever felt cool and didn't cost any extra and paid minimal attention to any kind of real tactics or gunplay.

No other ""once A-list"" actor since Nick Cage has taken this unexplainable route.I also suspect Bruce has a health issue because the number of his speaking lines in these movies is really limited...which would explain a lot, aside of his ego trying to stay relevant even if the plane is going down in flames with these movies.Maybe an accountant has mathematically shown that more money can be made taking this route than making a high quality streaming TV series, but Bruce has firmly chosen this road and is ruining his once admirable legacy.The movie is symbolic of the above....Take into for example the first 15 minutes. Human crew made contact and are infected and are taken into decontamination. No protocol is used as the space ship lands. The wisecracking soldiers walk the individuals inside as if the granma just arrived for Sunday supper...even though one girl is shoulder twerking with a white face and an ugly blister on her nose, another dude has also abnormal veins on his white face, etc. They get ""decontaminated"" in a shower area that looks like it belongs to a fitness gym by a dude in a painters outfit with a fire extinguisher. When all hell breaks loose and infected start attacking, the base alarm goes off...but no soldiers really come aside of the two that just died and were hesitant to shoot even as base people were dying. The Doctor doesn't want them dead at this point b/c they're beautiful to her. When the base goes on lockdown, the lights go red--the lights are the kind you buy at Home Depot and stick them against the shower tile of this ""gym"".

The explosion is so wea(!)but takes out the brood at the extreme ends. LOL!

Earning money without having to act himself must have looked like very easy money and without any risc.A foolish decision which might prove fatal for his career as this movie is so bad that it defies the human imagination. In some cases using a CGI caracter in a movie becomes essential when the actor dies in real life. That's not the case here, Bruce Willis is stil alive. The acting (if it can be called that) of his CGI duplicate is so terribly bad that it will have a terrible influence on his career.The movie is a complete waste of time due to bad acting all the actors; there's no real story in it, it completely lacks content, structure and explanation.In my opinion ""Cosmic Sin"" is even worse than ""Plan nine from outer space"", so it's best to keep away from it.",Cosmic Sin

Frank Grillo gets top billing but is on screen for about 5 minutes.
Mid to late movie direction is particularly poor, as you sometimes enter the zone of ""spooky ghostly characters in the dark"" and dudes in plastic outfits that bear no resemblance or relation to the interesting type of antagonist encountered in the first act.The redeeming quality is that it makes you think about what a cool story this could have been if it had a giant budget.

293,getphysicallyfit,Cosmic Sin Vs Breach. Why the same movie?,2,22 July 2021,"This review will be as sporadic as the this movies script.I love Bruce Willis. However, either his agent or Hollywood is trying to end his career. He still gave a solid performance, but the script was not put together well at all. Certain lines and scenes lead to nowhere. I mean, really, the sunglass scene with the kid and Dash? What was that? At least the sunglasses weren't on General Ryle like they were on Admiral Adams in Breach.SPEAKING OF
Breach vs Cosmic SinWas this Edward Drake's and Corey Large's attempt at redeeming themselves from Breach OR just another attempt to ruin Bruce's image.Same movie, swap out actors center around Bruce, and make another bad film. At least the F/X were a little bit better (and that's not saying much).So Bruce still plays the same role. Clay young becomes James Ford. Former Hard Charging Military Combat Officer reduced to drinking but still a bad arse.They swapped out Thomas Jane for Frank Grillo (without shades but same disposition) and gave them the same fate. AND I mean THE SAME FATE! Instead of giving Grillo a daughter, we gave him a relative in Braxton (Brandon Lee) to be over protective of and with reverse love interest with the Fiona. Swapped out Timothy Murphy for Costas Mandylor (with accents) and slightly different outcomes but still the SAME FATE. And we are ready to ... Not do much but the same as before.PLOTS: Okay slightly different plot where we in Breach mess up the earth (which we are doing now) vs Aliens coming to claim us and the earth/galaxy. BUT still based on Aliens able to inhabit human bodies. I get why in Breach, but what was the point in Cosmic Sin? They already have bodies. Again BAD Alien visuals. Okay Horrible. The Cosmic Sin Aliens were in plastic Priest outfits. And please explain to me why a highly advanced alien race chooses to charge into battle with sometimes swords and other times guns? This contradicts earlier when Dr. Lea points out, ""they learned how to use our weapons in seconds""? UHM, they looked just like the ones they were firing later on.Again please make up your mind about the weapons. Bullets or Lasers (same issue in Breach)?Noticeable mention/shout out. I carried a SAW in the military, and to see CJ PERRY (AKA LANA) one-handed carry around that cannon laser made question if i ever lifted a weight in my life. She was a beast.Scene transistion:
When Ford went to the armory to get a weapon at the beginning of the movie, how did he end up with NOT what he grabbed in the next scene when he uses it? He grabbed big laser rifle but instead showed up in the following scene shooting what looked like a Rocket Launcher when he took out the initial invading force on the base? Not even going to get into the scene where he is escorted into a cave with the cast of Cirque Du Soleil at the entrance. Tell me why the one alien is one arm and foot hanging on the tree? Where the hell did Braxton come from? Oh and what was that fight scene about between Braxton and the Alien?It's as though the directors did not care about the set, yet again. We are five centuries in the future using quantum physics to transport people hundreds of thousands of light-years away, yet we are still showing 600-year-old technology in the form of combustible engine pick-up trucks. Couldn't borrow some vehicles from Elon? Oh, let's not forget the motorcycle. But yet we have scenes of flying cars in the skyline one scene then a freeway with old vehicles the next. Speaking of transporting. Those ""space suits"" are able to allow you to survive in outer space without any form of Oxygen tanks (must be that 500 year new tech) And allow you to zoom through outer space, re enter another planets atmosphere not burn up and LAND the perfect landing that would make any gymnast blush but not correct when you bump into your fellow soldier?

I could go on.) and honestly even I had a hard time getting through this one. I expected Bruce Willis to be sleepwalking his way through, like most films he's done in the last decade, but I didn't expect Frank Grillo to be pulling the same stunt.The younger less known set of actors try to put some flavor into it and the script seems to be trying for some sort of ""is war just"" point, but the nebulously defined zombie/fantasy/scifi aliens make any ''''''deep''''' quotes feel haphazard and pretentious.The sets are basic, all of the action taking place on either A) a greenscreen, B) cement bunker or C) A rough greenscreen trying to approximate space. In still images, the sort of armor suits the characters wear look cool, however any time an actor moves, it's clear they're just plastic shells hastily velcro'd onto the actor in some sort of wetsuit.All that would be entirely excusable if the actual plot, or characters, or world was engaging.

The plot barely exists and what little of it does exist makes no sense (particurlarly an early scene regarding aliens attacking a military base).

We also have absolutely zero containment procedures in place for returning space explorers, who have OBVIOUSLY been contaminated with some kind of extraterrestrial virus (haven't we learned anything from Covid-19?) and just stick them in the shower room.

Is this the sequel to Battlefield Earth? Is that really Bruce Willis? Did he have a stroke or is it CGI Bruce - or did they just put a gun to his head? Does the female sniper really lug around a 20 foot long sniper rifle that shoots regular sniper bullets when shooting humanoids but can down fighter craft? Why! How do such stupid aliens (dumber than us and we're so dumb it seems contrived for a plot twist) build an inter dimensional portal that spans 680k light years only to let us blow it up with what amounts to a firecracker after letting us send a super nuke through. Oh sorry I spoiled it. Can such rot be spoiled? I mean - nobody reads these to see if they should see a movie. It's not like it's an actual movie we'd pay for at a theater.

I started to push myself, I hate leaving things unfinished. But then, I thought, why? What's the point? It's not going to get better. Will I feel good for having finished it? No, I decided. And that was that.It's too bad really. I love a sci-fi/space movie, so I tend to be quite lenient with them. Having said that, this one: terrible.The acting was okay. Not great. Some terrible spots. Bruce wasn't good. At all. Most others were just okay. Shoot, even the story might have been okay. But the screenplay was just bad. Bad dialogue. Bad scenes. I had a bad feeling when the movie opened up with like 5 F-bombs (just to be clear, I personally have absolutely no issue with bad language). Nothing screams ""I'm trying to be an edgy film, you better take me seriously!"" like opening up with 5 F-bombs. Ugh. And Bruce. I don't know if he needed some beer money, or this was a personal favor to a friend or something, but I would have figured a quick pass through the script and he would have been like ""Nope."" But not the case. I attribute his wooden, ""I don't care"" acting to the fact that he must have agreed without reading the script, saw what he got himself into, figured it was too late to back out, so phoned in his lines.And then right at the beginning when the alien-human things land in the ship (I'm not listing this as a spoiler since it's literally like 20 min into the movie) at the base, and there is literally no containment or ANYTHING between the 5 people that showed up for First Contact (seriously - this is supposed to be a BIG DEAL, First Contact, and there are like 5 people there for it?) so of course when the alien-humans start killing people there is no containment, no quarantine. Just everyone right there, all ready to be infected or something. It's just simply stupid. It's lazy writing, it's clear that the plot requires it for Edgy F-bomb Action and Awesome Gun Shootings. It's terrible. Completely unbelievable.So I gave up. It's not worth the time to finish. But hey, it's nice to know people are driving what appear to be gas powered Jeeps 500 years in the future.

Nothing about his acting, his lines, or the scenes he's in demonstrate why, exactly, he's the ""bloody general."" Well, unless you count firing a bazooka with less impact than WW2 counterpart at about fifty feet in a room.The entire movie is directed like a commercial or video game trailer. There are so many great shots with really (and I mean REALLY) good special effects that are framed well and accompanied by meaty, impactful sounds. But spliced between these interesting sequences are minutes and minutes of exposition with dialog that doesn't flow whatsoever. In fact, the whole plot is just five minutes stretched into ninety with almost all filler.

A little flat acting except from the ""wrench"" which in my opinion was the best in the whole movie. Bruce was very flat. There were also some really dull and dead moments. Although the special effects were okay the ""earth"" looked like it is today so I didn't have the feeling of 2500 or so (time period of the movie).Overall I can not recommend this, a waste of valuable time.

Bruce Willis is in it yes.. but I was sure he could act ? Right ? And then there are a few B grade actors as well as some who look like other actors.

I have read what the film is meant to be about, but still can't really fathom it.

404,WatchingFromWashington,How did this movie ever come to be?,1,24 July 2021,"The question that came to mind after the first 5 minutes of this. I admit. Bruce Willis was the only reason I considered watching this. But with a number of actors I did not recognize, and had all the markers of being a low budget looking film. Hmm... Bruce must have been bored and needed something to do and was paid a big chunk of change to do this or was doing a favor for someone trying to get their foot in the door of the film industry.As others stated, the advancement of humans and technology nowhere matched what one would expect for the time period set for this movie. This looks like it is set in say... the year 1994 with the exception of the space crafts.I've seen more futuristic characters, imaginative set designs, makeup, wardrobe and creativity in 22+ year old films like ""the 5th Element"",""the Matrix"", ""Alien""; a 42 year old movie which STILL holds its own and let us not forget ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" released in 1968 - a now 53 year old film.All this film delivered were a multitude of recognizable rip-offs from dozens of 90's sci-fi films and TV shows with a script sounding like it was written by a teenager and a forgettable story.Poor direction combined with horrible dialogue and poor acting make for a tedious film watching experience.Any moments that should be suspenseful fall flat and there's no chemistry between any of the actors. It almost feels as if they are all doing a dry run of the script while being filmed and in costume. Deaths and ""shoot-em-up"" scenes somehow lack any emotion, tension, or gravity; for me they evoked the same emotions as if I were watching a group of people standing in line waiting to check out at the grocery store. I was actually just distracted from the film just now by a number of birds that just flew past our office window and into a bush in the neighbor's yard - ""What's going on!"" I exclaimed. ""8 sparrows just flew into a bush across the street into the same spot!"" - ""I wonder what's in there and what's going on?"". Sorry, now back to my review - which I'm doing while sort of watching the film, but not really, anymore... as I've lost complete interest in it.Is there truly no imagination left in the film industry? This isn't the only piece of waste out there that somehow made it from script to screen instead of going to the scrap heap where it belongs. I'm sorry for being so harsh, but I just don't know how this movie ever came to be.This is definitely one of those films where one would say ""That's 43 minutes of my life that I can't get back."" *I started doing other things due to how bad this film was, so all told, I saw about 43 minutes of the film.Sorry guys, I'm going to give this a HUGE thumbs down.Save yourself the time and invest your time doing anything other than watching this.

The duo Edward Drake and Corey Large seems to have some deal with Bruce Willis and i guess its plain and simple. ""Bruce, i get to direct the movie, Corey gets a part in it and you get 90% of the budget as pension money. Sounds good?""The movie is supposed to take place 500 years into the future. But nothing feels futuristic. Actually the feeling is rather that civilization taken steps back, and some generals and ex generals takes some decisions of erradicating a alien civilization without running it past the government. The future technology has no thought behind it, and seems just play a part in giving the author to this movie loop holes to build their story around.Why Bruce Willis takes part in this crap is beyond me. Once he was a somewhat regarded actor, but perhaps the deal i described above is too good to turn down.Nothing makes sense, not the scenery, not the acting, not the plot or the fact that aliens apparently prefeer to use spears and swords when attacking hoomans with automatic weaponry. Drake, Large and Willis has more projects going on, and my only lingering question is who the fxxx finance this crap? Does Drake or Large have rich family? I cant think Bruce finance any of it. And im not suggesting it has a big budget, but still some money have to gone into it and that is baffling.Dont waste your time on this one.

415,digitalmacgyver,We wanted Halo we got Cosmic Shame,2,26 July 2021,"Let me first start by saying I had looked forward to this film. The potential of a franchise launching opportunity was there. The right cast was hired, and the story had potential.I can only assume that director Edward Drake never believed in it, or was looking simply for a quick paycheck. I can say Drakes career can only go up from here.The acting is sloppy, the dialog is 1999. The CGI had to been purchased off Fiverr to reduce costs. What could have been super cool the battle armor, was cosplay if you had a good budget but not skill. The scene where they try and put on their helmets was absolutely painful. They had to cut scene it because the actors could not get it on.As I said by the title we wanted Halo, we had hoped for a character to charm us like Master Chief. Nope. Instead we got a old grizzled character that we are introduced getting drunk and ends getting drunk. So everything in between is a hangover...which would explain the dialog or lack of.I would have like to cheer for some of the characters, but honestly they all could have died and we would have not noticed. The really only important person is the Engineer that everyone constantly puts down. Nice stereotyping in 2500.This is such a bad flick most reviewers never got past the first 20 minutes. I stayed for the whole thing, but wanted to fast forward after 15. This flick will be forgotten by end of the week, but it could have been amazing.

Short co-star parts are common in established sci-fi / action films (especially female), and we are granted here two contrasting women co-stars that have to be given attention otherwise you miss key movie themes.Action scenes vary from generic to plain idiotic, so we can only hope stunt people attached get granted a hefty sympathy vote towards their next projects.Lastly, the soundtrack. Yes, it actually has one. Again, with contracted time involved, sound engineering must've been stressed to amass most basic of effects, such that during the few tracks played through scenes barely any emotional synchronicity can be found.With minimal scenes, the movies bankable featured actor, actually doesn't do himself any harm, nor favours. Placing Bruce's performance firmly aligned with 'Last Man Standing', just below 'Armageddon'.Overall - A par-boiled and half plucked turkey, that stands a slender chance of being that elusive future un-discovered stars mythical rare gem.",Cosmic Sin

I saw the trailer, read the reviews and thought ""nah, no way Bruce Willis would go down in a fiery crash with his acting career doing below F grade movies."" Well, I was wrong. So VERY wrong. The reviews here are point on. I wish I could give this a movie a zero. It was the worst crap I've seen all year.I don't know if Bruce owes someone money or everyone in this film is hurting for cash because of COVID. It sucked BADLY. Seriously save your time and skip this one. It had everything bad that you could think of in a movie.The plot was weak and missing any details that would've made this movie somewhat interesting. The actors looked like they didn't care to be there, especially Bruce who seemed drunk or stoned most of the time. Also, the actions of the characters made absolutely no sense ""put your hands up"" to people that are decaying and zombie-looking. What the hell?!The editing was nauseating at best. The dialogs, oh god the dialogs were long and boring. Yak yak yak with pointless fillers that only extended the torture of trying to watch this.The CGI was mediocre at best. My pre-teen daughter plays with Blender and can do a WAY better job that what they did in this movie for CGI effects. The props were also pretty bad. Someone on here stated their suit of armour looked like plastic. No, it wasn't plastic, more like spray-painted foam with two colored LEDs mounted on each side of their heads. I have a 3D printer and I can make way better props than the ones used in this film. The music kept repeating the same annoying rhythms and drowning out the dialogs at times (may be I should be thankful for that).I found myself fast forwarding a lot through this movie HOPING for something good, for ANYTHING to redeem this crap that was wasting my precious time, but I was sorely disappointed. I can go on and on about how bad this was but I feel I've ranted enough. Please trust the reviews here, they are right. If not just trust me and avoid this one like the plague.",Cosmic Sin

This would be a fine sci fi attempt as a budget movie, but having two mega stars brings to light they had money and seemed to use it all on these two.Props: So having being in the prop world for a very long time. In movies using polyvinyl (pvc) is almost a dead method, except for budget movies. Everything from their armour to weapons look like plastic, and no matter the skill of the artist you can't really be convinced it's metal. Willis armour is probably painted the bettern painted due to the use of colour. But everyone else's literally looks like plastic and even with the ""clang"" sound effects you can tell they're moving in plastic. Where I was done is the small woman carrying a 2 metre futuristic 50 cal sniper with one hand. It bounces around like it's made of foam. It doesn't help keep you convinced this world is real. Also at one point the enemy is carrying a sword and it literally looks like a foam sword used for casting. It's not even slightly convincing or menacing.CGI: Given the horrible props the CGI was actually quite good! I would have rather see CGI armour, while not a preferred practice I think it would have helped.Story: literally couldn't keep up or understand wtf was happening Haha.

495,vegav-10398,Unengaging and Empty,2,27 July 2021,"I enjoy Sci-Fi films, sometimes even ""low-budget"" flicks because they can provide a ""once-in-a-while"" dive into something that hasn't been thought up. Some independent studios create excellent digital shorts pertaining to Sci-Fi, so I try to give many of these movies a chance. The best part, from my perspective, is that Sci-Fi can provide a deep and interesting framework from which they derive an engaging story, even with a low budget.This film failed to provide the deep and engaging material that one hopes for in a Sci-Fi movie. The scenes were rushed, thrown together, leaving the viewer asking way too many questions about how things ended up the way they were or blatantly laughing at the lack of thought put into the plot. It was empty-feeling, failing to draw me into the film. Perhaps others will experience something different, but this was not a well-made movie. Corny dialogue plagued the film, along with major jumps in the plot or setting with characters just showing up without much explanation.Dialogue - 2/10

I like Bruce Willis, I love SciFi so I thought this movie would have a bit going for it. How very mistaken I was!I don't think I've cringed this much trying to watch a movie ever. The dialogue was disjointed, screenplay I really think was written by a room full of illiterate monkeys on type writers just mashing keys, the acting was non-existent, the special effects look like they got someone on Fiver to do them (for $5), set design looked like they grabbed everything from a dollar shop and made do.I really think though that it all comes down to the director.... I can only assume that whatever budget was avalible for this film was instead spent of 8kg of blow which the director then spent snorting for the entire duration of making this film, pulled a kid still going to school out of film class to direct for him while he was f@$ked up on blow in his trailer. Whenever the kid had question, the director would just scream out through his closed trailer door between lines that the kid was doing great and just trust the process!I still don't know how this even got out of post production to actually be released.... I think post production likely consisted of a very strung out director stressing he had to deliver ANYTHING to justify the investors money (that he had taken and spent on blow) so did all the post production himself in a single day..... while strung out from all the blow!Maybe there was no blow and it was just a massive brain aneurysm that everyone just overlooked as this movie was nose dived off a cliff....I feel like they should have to pay me to reimburse my time wasted watching this movie.Every single person involved in the making of this movie should take a good hard look in the mirror and ask themselves ""WTF were we doing!""Don't pay to stream this movie, its a waste of your money.

You look and sound so disinterested. Sad...The 'Aliens'... god that's funny. To begin with they ALL move at the same time with neck twitches...think Michael Jackson's Thriller and you've nailed it! Then they are all dressed like Comicon fans in Assassin's Creed outfits. With masks (convenient cost saving on make-up).The 'Plot'...basically Kill'em All. But from start to finish there are perhaps 15 aliens in total. And the biggest one was killed with 3 pistol rounds.The 'Special Effects'...well, there's a 'SpaceGate' (guess #Stargate was already used?). There's a Kick-A## female soldier carrying an 8ft barrel from a Tiger tank and firing it with ease. There's a secret planetary base for the Orbital Cannon that is lit up like a NightClub in multi-coloured LEDs and has a Military logo projected on it's side (honestly!).The 'Pivotal' scenes... Bruce Willis is led into a cave by multiple Aliens. He has a meeting with someone under bright lights...then walks out later with no-one around?? A 3 minute conversation with a little girl asking if one of the characters can wear her sunglasses is another equally gripping scene.The 'Q-Bomb' Maguffin (from the infinitely better 1959 film -'The Mouse That Roared') ... ""if you drop it you'll wipe out from Earth to Pluto""...next thing it's getting shot out of a massive cannon over thousands of miles?The 'Slow Motion' scenes... why?..just why?The 'Armoured suits'...made of thin plastic, there to 'protect' them - but then they say to 'self destruct' one? So your armoured suit has a bomb in it as well??The 'Scientist'...so she just stands around while the Aliens slaughter the humans and says 'don't kill them'?The Imperial Guard Tie-Fighter at 41 minutes... WHY?I could go on and on..but I'll summarise.Bruce - take a leaf from your Hard Rock pals Arnold and Sylvester.. Pick better scripts!! It's not about the bottom line.

So what happened to Bruce Willis' movie choices? Is he in a secret competition with Nicholas Cage to star in the most B movie bombs, or is he simply bored with too much idle time? The first three sentences of this script starts off with F bombs, as if this adds to its appeal (appealing to junior high kids going through puberty, perhaps). Then we hear an atmospheric breach signal from the computer (everybody hears it, by the way), but the highly-skilled astronaut/soldier does not, and berates his companion who warns him of a pending threat. He steps out of the tent and fires randomly in every direction to prove no threat exists? Who wastes ammunition in every random direction when silence to hear an approaching threat may be useful? Not a trained soldier or security expert, that's who. Then the infected Alliance personnel are brought to the base with no extreme biohazard precautions in place? Then when the infected personnel lash out like zombies, killing a top commander, the other soldiers bearing weapons just stand there and watch him be killed? Please Bruce, as a fan since the 80's, please just stop with these nonsensical scripts; they are pure garbage. As dedicated fans of this genre we will gladly patronize a Venmo account or charity on your behalf to stop you from this madness.

Did I see something more terrible in my whole life? would I see something worse before I die ? I wasn't prepared for such life changing questions.Even the CGI for the alien spaceships were old school, maybe from the mid-eighties.. take one ship.. copy/paste the exact same ship x 50 times and you have the alien army.Because I try to be a positive person, I really hope this movie will help Bruce with his taxes, and maybe enable some of the other actors to pay for acting school.",Cosmic Sin

You don't get to sympathise too much with the carachters cause you don't get to know who the hell they are apart from military grades, so the suspense about their destiny gets killed too. There are some injustified ""visions"" implied. The aliens looks exactly like Lovecraft's Chtulhu, I mean, at least whip up something new. One of the final scene it's just unbereably stupid as it was written by an unsecure kid who represents himself as a big hero engaging a fist fight and then violently stabbing a nearly dead alien.

659,brokenskull12,Classic Bruce! Absolutely hilarious!,1,25 June 2021,"As most of you already know, as of late Bruce has been in some pretty bad (but hilarious!) B level movies, such as: First kill, Hard kill, Survive the night, Breach and my personal favorite, Trauma Center. If you ever need a good laugh or feeling down, I recommend watching this movie. Trauma Center will make you laugh till it hurts. All his current movies have low rent, substandard acting, atrocious facial expressions, the plot is always dead weight and never makes any type of sense. No character development whatsoever, bad bad bad special effects. The list continues. But yet you are glued to the television to see how bad it truly can get. Also, his movies recently have something else in common. Frank Grillo, Chad Michael Murray and Bruce Willis performing like he is three sheets the wind. Does he show up to work on set drunk?? And on the day of filming he finally reads his script for the first time and in 10 minutes they start shooting the film?? Bruce has lost it. It's quite sad but it's hilarious. He has terrible facial expressions, acts like he doesn't want to be there and he is in these movies for about 10-15 minutes! Cosmic sin is the same exact way. Frank Grillo (who's a bad as* in the purge movies) went full Bruce Willis mode and acted drunk with terrible facial expressions and acted like he didn't even want to be there. Everyone in Cosmic Sin including CJ Perry a.k.a Lana from the wwe is absolute garbage in this film and is a terrible actress. 25 minutes into this movie I fell asleep. That should say something, right? It made zero sense. The special effects were laughable and it seemed like they were designed and produced by a kindergartner. The director, producer, and whoever wrote the screenplay should feel absolutely embarrassed that this disaster film was even made. But yet, I look forward to the next disaster in the Bruce Willis catalog. So, if you ever need a laugh, feeling sad, or even feeling miserable, I recommend watching this film or any of his recent films. I look forward to the day Bruce Willis and Nick Cage star in a movie together. Talk about classic!",Cosmic Sin

Besides a few things that were future like. It definitely did not fit the year it was trying to go for. Like the cars it showed definitely did not fit the era. I can over look that for the most part though I have seen worse, but the I feel the nail in the coffin for me was the absolute terrible dialog, it felt awkward for most of the movie and alot of the scenes looked like what I could do with my friends when we messed around making movies for fun as kids. On top of that I wanted to see the aliens more and all we got was something that looked like the villans in the old power ranger shows when they attacked.

The action scenes were so disjointed they didn't even make sense.I rarely write reviews, but this movie was so utterly bad I had to vent my thoughts and warn you good people to NOT WASTE YOUR TIME watching this putrid drivel of a movie!!

695,punkrawker-42672,Sorely under-appeciated.,7,30 October 2021,"This movie isn't for everyone, clearly. A bit of a shame really, as it's a classic sci-fi adventure that revolves around exploring an interesting premise.This movie, if turned into a short-fiction novel, would make for a fun Sunday read, even if a bit geeky in nature.Where this movie loses some critics is that it is a low-budget film, with a big-name actor being the only surface-level attraction. If you accept it as a made-for-TV movie rather than a blockbuster, you may be more easily look past its limitations.The premise of the movie is how should terrains, spacefaring humans, react to first contact with a suspected aggressive alien race. Some movies with such a premise play out the notion of humans being being dominated by the aliens and enslaved, which is what critics love to see. This movie takes an aggressive opposing stance, even more so than Ender's Game, and argues for swift action over weakness.""I was late once and so he broke my nose. I was never late again.""Geeky Easter eggs exist in the movie, such as the space battleships you see appear to be StarCraft Terran Battlecruisers. It helps to explain the universe without needing to say much at all; something critics would miss.Like most of Bruce Willis movies these days, they run counter to modern liberal norms. I'm giving this movie a 7/10, as there were some cheesy fight scenes and some of the props looked a bit silly. The story was a bit abrupt at times, which might cause issues for viewers that need things spelled out for them, but I didn't have that issue myself.Overall, I enjoyed watching it.",Cosmic Sin

Couldnt watch it in one go, found myself escaping the torture every couple of minutes.
Acting aligned with the simple cliche story so do not expect anything in that area as well. Very little character back story and universe lore, characters are shallow and aliens are just simple strange looking cannon fodder with high tech appearing randomly, talking some brief non sense here and there and doing silly stuff before they are shot.
Sound was okay I guess for a low budget... thats why I gave it 2.I think anyone can guess how it ends in the first 5 minutes so not even bothering to put a spoiler here. If there was one thing surprising, its that Bruce didnt do 99% of the killing, that came really unexpected.",Cosmic Sin
