0,MartinHafer,"Well made, but I don't quite get the reputation of this film....",8,24 April 2011,"""Bonny and Clyde"" is a classic--now adored by critics and film historians. It's considered ground-breaking because of its style of film making as well as its violence--something previously unseen in films. And, while I did enjoy it, I just didn't understand the love people have heaped upon it. Yes, it was well made but the film was far from perfect. My biggest complaint against it is my history teacher complaint--it was bad history. Bonny was 4'10"" and darker haired--nothing like the more glamorous Faye Dunaway. And many of the things attributed to them in the film were actually things done by John Dillinger , Pretty Boy Floyd or other criminals. And, most importantly, they were NOT heroes but evil bastards who killed and robbed with abandon. No, the film is NOT even close to being historically accurate.Now I am NOT saying this is a bad film. It is exciting and enjoyable--and it presents Bonnie and Clyde as we WISHED they'd been. The exciting anti-heroes who actually were characters more of the 1960s than anything else. They flaunted convention, rebelled against the status quo and 'did their own thing'--sort of like hippie versions of the 1930s. It is a 60s version of the 1930s--sexy, crazy and fun...but NOT the actual Bonnie and Clyde. For what it is, it's very well done...but also a retired history teacher's worst nightmare! The acting is good, the direction very good and the story interesting. However, it is odd that Estelle Parsons won the Oscar among the five nominated actors--as she was god-awful. Her screaming and annoying character was not just historically wrong but very annoying. How she alone won an Oscar is beside me. A very good film...but a far from perfect film. And without Parsons' wretched characterization, I'd have given this one a 9.",Bonnie and Clyde
1,TheLittleSongbird,One of the best movies of the '60s,10,2 May 2011,"I am not sure whether I can add to the commentators who have talked about how good Bonnie and Clyde is, but I'll have a go. I didn't see Bonnie and Clyde until quite recently, and I can completely understand the film's reputation as it is a fantastic film. It is very well made, with crisp cinematography and a superb period recreation. The violence here is not cartoony, it is very violent and shocking, as seen in the ending which I also found quite affecting. Arthur Penn directs beautifully, there is a compelling story, a slick pace and a cracking script with some of the most important and sharpest dialogue in any film of the '60s. I was amazed by the last scene with Bonnie and her mother, it was a scene that is very chilling but also one that resonates emotionally too. And the acting I have no qualms with. Gene Hackman is wonderful as is Estelle Parsons as a somewhat annoying character. Also Gene Wilder makes a brief but funny appearance. But the film belongs to Warren Beatty and Faye Dunnaway, who actually become the characters rather than just playing them. Overall, a fantastic film and one of the best and most important of its decade. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Bonnie and Clyde
2,bkoganbing,"""We Rob Banks""",9,4 April 2010,"Bonnie And Clyde tells the story of Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker two of the Thirties most legendary bandits who became folk heroes to a Depression ridden America. The film took some liberty with the facts, but caught the essence of these two cheerfully amoral people.For one thing Bonnie Parker was in fact already married to someone else when she took up with Clyde Barrow. Her husband doesn't appear in the film and gets nary a mention. Still as is shown the life of excitement that career criminal Barrow offers her is far better than slinging hash and dodging passes from the locals.Probably the biggest historical liberty is taken with Frank Hamer who is played by Denver Pyle. Hamer was a legendary Texas Ranger who had retired a few years earlier when he got a commission from Governor Miriam Ferguson of Texas to head up a task force to get Bonnie And Clyde in the old west tradition of dead or alive. He went about his work as methodically as Melvin Purvis tracking down John Dillinger for the FBI. He NEVER was kidnapped and humiliated as Pyle is shown in this film it was just another job of law enforcement for Hamer.Bonnie And Clyde is a violence ballet worthy of Sam Peckinpaugh though it was Arthur Penn who directed it. It was good enough to net Bonnie And Clyde one of its two Oscars for Cinematography. The other Oscar the film won was by Estelle Parsons for Best Supporting Actress as Barrow's poor sister-in-law who gets caught up in all the excitement when all she was doing was accompanying husband Gene Hackman on a visit to see his kid brother.Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway also got nominated for playing our protagonist leads. In fact it was their first nominations as it was also for Gene Hackman and Michael J. Pollard who were nominated for Best Supporting Actor. Beatty and Dunaway worked well together, I'm surprised that they didn't do more as a team. Dunaway made a career of playing women with unconventional morals, her other two actress nominations were for a victim of incest in Chinatown and a woman who though far better educated was as amoral as Bonnie Parker in Network. Dunaway won her Oscar for that part.Bonnie And Clyde as a portrait of the lawless Thirties when hard times gave some people all the justification they needed for a life of crime holds up very well today. It lost the Best Picture Oscar to In The Heat Of The Night which was also a groundbreaking, but more conventional style film on racism. Overall though I think Bonnie And Clyde probably is a better film.",Bonnie and Clyde
3,Leofwine_draca,An iconic movie,8,29 April 2017,"BONNIE AND CLYDE is the first of many 'couples on the run' movies to come out over the years; other notable examples include BADLANDS, THELMA & LOUISE, KALIFORNIA, and NATURAL BORN KILLERS. This one has the hook of being a true story and provides a fitting depiction of Depression-era America in the process. As such it's an iconic movie, pushing boundaries in terms of the depiction of on-screen violence (even though it looks quite tame for modern viewers) and delivering some timeless performances to boot.Warren Beatty is all suave and sophistication as the likable Clyde, while Faye Dunaway gets more depth as the messed-up Bonnie. The great supporting cast is a real surprise too, with Michael J. Pollard in one of those unique, undefinable roles and Gene Hackman burning up the screen in a star-making turn. What surprised me most about BONNIE AND CLYDE is that it's played as a comedy for a lot of the time, adding a lightness of touch to an otherwise gruelling subject matter.",Bonnie and Clyde
4,SnoopyStyle,Wild fun violent ride,8,8 August 2014,"It's around 1930 or '31. Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway) is a restless waitress when Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty) tries to steal her mother's car. Instead he steals her heart. The duo set off on a crime spree. They are later joined by C.W. Moss (Michael J. Pollard) and then his older brother Buck Barrow (Gene Hackman) and his wife Blanche (Estelle Parsons).This is definitely a based on a true story type of movie. There is a lot of shooting and violence especially for its time. It treats the violent duo with a touch of comedy and a good dose of fun. They are the romanticized outlaws. It leaves the gritty realism behind although they don't leave out the blood. With all the violence and action, I do wish for better choreography but it's still quite exhilarating for its era. The characters are joking around a lot. Gene Wilder has a hilarious minor role as a kidnap victim of the gang. It's a fun ride.",Bonnie and Clyde
5,Hitchcoc,You Don't Need to Like the People,9,5 April 2006,"I agree with most folks who have reviewed this film. It has everything a well rounded motion picture can have. Two very charismatic leads, several supporting roles of great depth, brilliant cinematography, and a good story. Even the most minor roles sparkle. This is a story about a sociopath (Bonnie), meeting up with a low self esteem wanderer who is pretty spineless until she shows up (Clyde) and what happens when you set into motion a series of events that can only lead to destruction. Of course, the final scene is one of the most famous in all of movie history and opened the door for future films. It also glamorizes the two anti-heroes and puts them out there. Personally, I don't see them as glamorous at all; they are low life killers with no real respect for human life. That said, their portrayal is extremely well done. When Bonnie sees her mother for the last time, there is that element that you can't go home again. They have cut a path through the film. They have become the stuff of fiction. They are even blamed for crimes they didn't commit. Children read dime novels about them. I just wanted ot mention Gene Hackman and Estelle Parsons. They don't have the savvy and the bravado that the title characters have, but they fill the screen. Fantastic performances. When I was a child, my parents ran a restaurant. I got to know a drifter who washed dishes for us. He left and a couple weeks later, we found out he had been shot and killed when he and his partner tried to commit a robbery. I remember the police talking to may parents as part of a routine investigation. When I see the people who surround the main characters in this film, I think back to this guy, especially when I watch the Hackman role.",Bonnie and Clyde
6,mark.waltz,Taking the American folk hero story to a new level of both highs and lows.,10,2 June 2017,"Practically everything in this violent somewhat fictionalized story of Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow is brilliant in the history of cinema. From the outstanding script by David Newman, Robert Benton and Robert Towne to the non-stop moving camera work of Burnett Guffey, the fast-moving bluegrass score of Broadway legend Charles Strouse, and of course the thrilling direction by Arthur Penn. And then there's the stars, two beautiful people in the 1960's, legends today (in spite of an Oscar gaffe), a fantastic supporting cast, and every detail just perfect. It's a film that helped change the way that Hollywood made movies, and even if the story had been told before, this one got it right, even if the facts were a little off.The moment you see Faye Dunaway, you are captivated. She is stunning. She wears those classy Theadora Van Runkle designs like a fashion week model, even if her character is supposedly dirt poor and bored with her life as a nine o'clock girl in a five o'clock town. Unlike the real Bonnie Parker, she oozes glamour and sex appeal, and while Bonnie in real life wanted to become a movie star, it was her second film portrayer who did thanks to this movie. Unlike Dorothy Provine's Bonnie in the 1958 American International cult classic, Dunaway is subtle, and her inner soul shows torment even though she's a definite wild child. Not dealt with is Bonnie's real-life marriage, and also not mentioned is the rumored bi- sexuality of Clyde Barrow. After all, you couldn't have hunky Warren Beatty being attracted to men, right? Bonnie does question him about it when he indicates a disinterest in sex, and he basically just reveals he's more asexual than anything else even though rumors have circulated otherwise. Together, Dunaway and Beatty make screen magic, and even if their nights aren't on fire, when they are out there robbing banks and gas stations (a bit exaggerated to what has been revealed about the two in real life), it is as if they are at the height of sexual ecstasy. The victims get it good (one right in the eye!), and Denver Pyle as the victimized agent is totally humiliated when they get him alone with a gun on him and a camera in his face. There's also compassion for a sharecropper who is allowed to keep his money when they rob the bank he's attempting to do business with, and gentle conversation with Gene Wilder, the owner of a car they steal, that is until they find out what he does for a living. Mabel Cavitt has a memorable scene as Bonnie's plain talking mama, speaking her lines amateurishly, but so real that you can see an attempt to portray the agony that any decent God fearing mother like her would feel to know that their child is a ruthless killer. Major supporting roles are filled out brilliantly with Oscar nominations going to Michael J. Pollard as one of their gang members and Gene Hackman as Clyde's brother, Buck, and a win for Estelle Parsons as the screaming Blanche (Buck's wife) who seems to instantly have it in for Bonnie, but coming through when the chips are down. They are sketched out brilliantly with little nuances here and there revealing that these characters aren't just law hating monsters, even though the audience might have a twinge of guilt over wanting them to get away from their crimes. This is brilliant in every aspect, and I couldn't imagine the TV version of the story being any better, although a Broadway musical was respectful to both the truth and this film even if the guilt of rooting for them made me not cheer them on so much. But considering the ton of garbage out there on the legendary criminals of the depression, this one ranks as tops and has never been surpassed.",Bonnie and Clyde
7,classicsoncall,"""We rob banks"".",9,30 September 2008,"I just watched this film again, forty years after seeing it for the first time. The first thing that struck me was - holy cow! - where did that forty years go?!! As regards the picture, I thought that maybe with just the most minor of tinkering, it very well could have been made today. If so, it might not have passed the blood and gore test that seems to be a staple of modern films, but considering that it was made back in the day, this was pretty wild stuff for the late 1960's. The movie helped usher in a new genre of violent films juxtaposed with humor, and was one of the first to treat it's protagonists, though remorseless criminals, as anti-heroes who one might actually root for in their Robin Hood personas. I didn't really remember a whole lot of the picture from seeing it back in 1967, having completely forgotten the roles of the supporting players, Gene Hackman, Michael J. Pollard, and Estelle Parsons. Pollard popped up in a lot of films during this period, generally in roles like the one here, owing no doubt to his eccentric look and manner. He could wind up anywhere and usually did, perhaps gaining his greatest notoriety as Little Fauss to Robert Redford's 'Big Halsy' in the picture of the same name. Say, when you first see the shirtless C.W. Moss, that tattoo of a lady seemed to be on his stomach, but in the scene at the campground after Bonnie and Clyde are shot, that tat appeared to have drifted up to his chest - check it out.I never really felt strongly about Warren Beatty, but I have to say, he put a lot of nuance into the character of Clyde Barrow. The best scene to portray that would have to be when he first meets Bonnie Parker. Just watch as he works the matchstick in his mouth, exuding a cockiness that just begged for Bonnie to touch his gun. There was more pent up sexuality in that scene than a lot of films are able to convey in twice the amount of time. But then the picture does a complete one eighty, as Clyde is unable to perform in the romance department in scene after scene. The one hint to his sexual preference comes across in that card game scene when he hunches up close to C.W., but then nothing more is made of it. So in that regard, the picture drops the ball a bit, when much more could have been explored in regard to the frustration Bonnie experienced each time she tried to close the deal. Yeah I know, they did get to finally do it, but Bonnie seemed to be just a little too understanding along the way.It's funny sometimes how my timing with certain pictures winds up mirroring current events in the news. Seeing the poster of 'FDR For President' comes on the heels of that Joe Biden gaffe about a week ago when he talked about Roosevelt going on TV to calm the country during the Great Depression. Of course Herbert Hoover was president in 1931, and there was no TV. As for Clyde Barrow, he seemed to have some problem with the press at the time because they didn't report his exploits properly - can you imagine?Anyway, this is a great picture on a number of levels - as a period piece with some outstanding scenes of 1930's city life and all those wonderful old automobiles, as well as a precursor to later pictures pushing the envelope with violence and brutality. The final scene is actually quite jarring even today, particularly when it's a woman who's getting rubbed out by the authorities. Not a scene for the faint of heart, especially as it's prolonged for maximum effect, and played at various speeds to heighten the emotions of the viewer. It's one of those scenes that's easy to remember, even after forty years.",Bonnie and Clyde
8,gavin6942,An Important Cultural Achievement,8,28 June 2012,"Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway) and Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty) travel across the country, robbing banks and carrying on in a crazy romance.While the movie itself is pretty great, both well-made and entertaining, the real achievement here is a cultural one. This solidified Beatty and Dunaway, as well as Gene Hackman, as important actors, and also featured great performances from character actors Michael J. Pollard and Denver Pyle.It is also important as the film debut of Gene Wilder. Wilder is, sadly, a weaker actor in the film, and exhibits signs of comedy in a film that does not need it. Of course, this is easily overlooked.Most interestingly, this movie allegedly made Bonnie and Clyde household names. Everyone knows them today, but apparently from 1935-1965 they were obscure and not the national figures we now think them to be. Their place in history has now been re-imagined and falsely emphasized... all because of this movie.And, again, despite being only very loosely based on reality (the main characters are more likable, their gang is too small and the notorious incident of them driving off a cliff is absent), it is quite the memorable expression of their story.",Bonnie and Clyde
9,lee_eisenberg,Fight the power!,10,31 July 2005,"1967 may go down in history as the year that really changed movies, what with ""Bonnie and Clyde"", ""The Graduate"" and ""In the Heat of the Night"". With the younger generation growing displeased with authority, it made sense that ""Bonnie and Clyde"" should identify with the title characters running from the law. Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway) and Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty) may have been violent, but they were a challenge to the power structure. A scene that may or may not have been inserted for comic relief is the scene where tag-along C.W. Moss (Michael J. Pollard) meets Clyde's Bible-thumping sister-in-law Blanche (Estelle Parsons) while in his underwear. And of course, the final scene is beyond mind-blowing. Just imagine how it must have seemed when the movie first debuted. The point is, this movie shows why the word ""masterpiece"" exists.Just an extra thing. My mom always tells me about how, after she saw this movie when it first debuted, she plucked out her eyebrows so as to look like Faye Dunaway. As it is, looking at Faye Dunaway in this movie, who wouldn't want to look like her?",Bonnie and Clyde
10,jboothmillard,Bonnie and Clyde,10,12 June 2006,"Based on two real robbers, this film really illustrates the world of villains and makes us think of them nearly as heroes because of what they get away with. Basically spotting him snooping around her house, Bonnie Parker (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Faye Dunaway) meets Clyde Barrow (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Warren Beatty, also producer of the film) and they instantly feel something, not that romantic though. Clyde reveals to Bonnie that he has a habit for robbing banks, and he trains her to use a gun, and they quickly start robbing banks and stealing cars together. Throughout the whole film this continues, and they are joined by C.W. Moss (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and twice Golden Globe nominated Michael J. Pollard), brother Buck Barrow (Oscar nominated Gene Hackman) and his wife Blanche (Oscar winning Estelle Parsons). They rob plenty of banks and are most wanted faces, the police are prepared to kill them if that is what it takes to stop them, and Bonnie, Clyde to get close to arrest or death quite a few times. In the end, after the death Buck, the capture of blinded Blanche, and C.W. going back to his disappointed father, Bonnie and Clyde are conned by C.W.'s father Ivan (Dub Taylor) to stop the car, and our two anti-heroes are gunned down by machine gun, they deserved it. Also starring Denver Pyle as Frank Hamer and a brief debut by Gene Wilder as Eugene Grizzard. The two leading stars are fantastic villains based in the Depression era that you are almost routing for as they rob banks and make their getaways, the supporting cast all get their moments too, especially the deserved Oscar winner Parsons. This definitely taps into the same violent nature and almost possible glorification of violence Natural Born Killers created years later, it is still as poignant and gripping as it was when it was a big hit in the cinema, a must see crime drama. It won the Oscar for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Director for Arthur Penn, Best Picture and Best Writing, Story and Screenplay - Written Directly for the Screen, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Director and Best Screenplay. Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow were number 32 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 41 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""We rob banks.""), it was number 65 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, it was number 13 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 27 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 66 on The 100 Greatest Films.

11,ccthemovieman-1,Great For Its Day,8,25 April 2006,"For a long, long time this was a memorable film and one of my favorites. It was one of the first VHS tapes I bought. After a long hiatus, I bought the DVD, watched it again and - wow, it wasn't so hot anymore.Oh, Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway and Michael J. Pollard are still very good in their respective roles as Clyde, Bonnie and C.J. What annoyed me were the characters played by Gene Hackman and Estelle Parsons. Hackman has gone on to have a very distinguished career but he is just a stupid moron in here he's no fun to watch. However, it's a picnic watching him compared to listening to Parsons shrieking and screaming through her abrasive role. Those two ruin the film for me now.I'll still have fond memories and I'll always remember the time I first saw this in the theaters when it came out. The violent ending caused quite a stir at that time. Nobody had seen blood and bullets on screen like that before. Now, it's commonplace....even tame compared to many of today's scenes!This was another of those films that began in the '60s in which the bad guys were portrayed as the good guys and vice-versa. It's still highly-recommended for those who have never viewed it.",Bonnie and Clyde
12,rmax304823,Landmark.,7,31 May 2012,"Bobert Benton knows how to write a screenplay that reflects the Zeitgeist and Arthur Penn is an intelligent and perceptive director with a social conscience. Warren Beatty is as handsome as they come, and Faye Dunway is sexy and gloriously blond and never looked better in her life. How could anything go wrong when all the right elements were there to begin with? Then, on top of all that, the lesser known talents outdid themselves -- Theodora Van Runkle's period wardrobe, the colorful location shooting in the dry part of Texas, the unimpeachable photography of Burnett Guffey, and the production design and set dressing on which such care was obviously lavished. The paint is peeling off the old farm houses and the Coca Cola signs on the gas stationed are dusty and bleached by the hot sun.There is comedy and action aplenty. The gang steal a car belonging to Gene Wilder and his girl friend and take them for the ride of their lives. Escapes are made to the rollicking banjo tune of Pike County Breakdown. Everybody just a-laughing and a-hugging until the shooting starts, and ends, in dead earnest.It's all beautifully done. When I first saw it in a theater I was moved by it. Anyone would be. Two happy-go-lucky kids shot to pieces.It's a poetic film -- and yet a repugnant one. It isn't just the historical inaccuracies -- Bonny and Clyde were two homely small-time hoodlums and not Robin Hoods -- but the message behind the film itself. It's good to be the violent insurgent.Of course, in 1967 we were in the middle of a war that absolutely no one could explain satisfactorily. (Plus ca change.) There were street demonstrations, angry editorials, veterans throwing medals onto the White House lawn, and President Lyndon B. Johnson holding his head in his hands, wondering where it all went wrong, and firmly refusing to ""cut and run."" But that doesn't excuse the simple-minded pep talk that ""Bonny and Clyde"" resolves itself into. The humility that Johnson lacked was also lacking in Arthur Penn, whose estimate was that the American people were so dumb that they needed a lecture to convince them that they were immoral and that, by inference, he was not.I always figured that my immorality, which was considerable, was my own business, although it never extended to anything resembling an endorsement of the Vietnam war. It's a beautifully executed, gorgeous movie. My response to its cover message is, ""Get off my back."" Except for its enthralling imagery, it might as well be John Wayne's ""The Green Berets.""",Bonnie and Clyde
13,Tweekums,An exciting tale of two depression era criminals,9,6 June 2019,"This film tells the story of two real life criminals who gain infamy in depression era America as they robbed banks and killed many people, including several police officers. When we meet them Bonnie Parker is living at home when she sees ex-con Clyde Barrow trying to steal her mother's car. Seeking a relief from boredom she joins him and learns of his past as an armed robber... she then goads him into committing a robbery. Soon the two of them are on the run committing a string of robberies; the spoils are hardly impressive though. Later they invite C.W. Moss, a gas station attendant to join them... things soon turn bad. At their next robbery he parks the car rather than waiting where they expect him, delaying the getaway and leading to the death of a bank employee. They are now wanted killers. After this they join up with Clyde's brother Buck and his wife Blanche and become the 'Barrow Gang'. More robberies are committed, more people die and their ultimate fate seems certain.For its time this film was ground-breaking as it is centred on the criminals and introduces them in a way that makes it hard not to be sympathetic with them. They are fun protagonists and their victims aren't introduced before being killed so there is no time for the viewer to get to know them. This is particularly revolutionary when one considers the fact that this is based on historic events rather than being a work of fiction... like most 'historical' films it plays fast and loose with the truth at times. The various killings are shown in a fairly matter of fact way; very violent for the time it was made but mostly fairly tame by modern standards. Somewhat surprisingly there is quite a bit of comedy in the film; emphasised by the way it is filmed which often gave movement a feel of '30s films. The cast do a fine job; Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty are great in the lead roles. The supporting cast are also solid; this includes Gene Wilder in his first role as one half of a car-jacked couple who end up laughing with their captors. Overall I'd say this is a must see for fans of the genre and anybody interesting in the history of film.",Bonnie and Clyde
14,ma-cortes,Bank robbers during Great Depression well played by Beatty and Dunaway,8,31 March 2008,"The picture tells the lurid criminal story of a famous delinquents couple, detailing a mythologized biography. In the time of the Great Depression, Clyde Barrow(top notch Warren Beatty) recently out of jail knows to Bonnie Parker(gorgeous Faye Dunaway), both become bank robbers. The antiheroes go across the American Midwest and South robbing banks and stores during the 20s, embarking in a criminal rampage. They form a criminal gang, united with accomplices as Cyde's brother named Buck(incomparable Gene Hackman) and his spouse(Estelle Parsons was Oscar winner), besides an unexperienced young(unforgettable Michael J Pollard). But they're pursued by a revenger sheriff(Denver Pyle).This classic movie displays drama, love, noisy action, violence and is quite entertaining. In spite of thirty years from film-making still hold well and remains interesting. In the wake of the recently released Sam Peckinpah's Wild Bunch, the movie is plenty of grisly violence with a violent ending was deeply polemic. Colorful and glittering cinematography by Burnett Guffey was Oscar winner, and atmospheric musical score by Charles Strouse. Excellent art direction by Dean Tavoularis and evocative costumes by Theodora Van Runkle. The motion picture is magnificently directed by Arthur Penn. The picture spawned pretty imitators, and created a sub-genre about Great Depression outlaws, such as Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, Machine Gun Kelly, among others. Another updating about Clyde Borrow and Charlie Parker existence are : ¨Bonnie Parker story¨(1958) by William Witney with Dorothy Provine and a rendition for TV(1992) by Gary Hoffman with Tracy Needham and Dana Ashbrook.",Bonnie and Clyde
15,BA_Harrison,"Jump on the running board and join the ride, you won't want to miss out on Bonnie and Clyde.",9,31 March 2016,"Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow were depression-era criminals who travelled the central United States with their gang, robbing banks and killing people. Despite the very violent nature of their exploits, the pair were romanticised by the press and have since become part of popular American folklore, often thought of as wild-hearted lovers on the run rather than cold-blooded sociopaths with a total disregard for human life.Arthur Penn's 1967 movie about the gun-toting couple is definitely guilty of romanticising and glamourising their criminal ways, not least by casting Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty in the lead roles, but it also takes off its rose-tinted spectacles from time to time to show the viewer just how bloody things really got when the Barrow gang arrived in town. And in its brutal finale, Penn ensures that the viewer fully understands that crime doesn't pay with a slow-motion scene in which the film's anti-heroes are riddled with thousands of bullets.Poetic, violent, romantic, and even occasionally funny, with excellent performances, impressive production values (the period detail is amazing) and wonderful cinematography, Bonnie and Clyde is one of the most iconic and enjoyable gangster films ever made.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",Bonnie and Clyde
16,moonspinner55,Bloodshed in the American Dustbowl...,7,7 October 2008,"Although numerous chapters in film manuals have been dedicated to Arthur Penn's violent, jagged, cynical ""Bonnie and Clyde""--and, indeed, it kick-started a new permissiveness in American movies which then generated many imitations--the first 20 or so minutes of the picture are pretty awful. Depression-era waitress, bored and thrill-seeking, finds herself drawn to a smooth-talking, reckless hood, an ex-con who, when playfully dared to, robs a general store right in front of her. He's sexually impotent but does have a sympathetic heart for the unfortunates and the working class; she's a high-wire act, strictly amoral and greedy. Their initial meeting outside her house has all the conventions of a standard 1930s drama--and just because the movie's look is generally correct doesn't mean what's happening on the screen is original. Producer Warren Beatty and screenwriters Robert Benton and David Newman were inspired by the French New Wave in regards to the film's approach and style, and their efforts to duplicate the amoral feel of European films paid off (this is a good-looking picture shot by Burnett Guffey, who won an Oscar). However, Arthur Penn's direction isn't visionary, and the multiple car-riding shots with back projection don't seem to break new ground. The film's greatest achievement--aside from its textured look--is the casting: Beatty and Faye Dunaway do marvelous work in the leads; Gene Hackman and Estelle Parsons are also fine as Clyde's brother and sister-in-law (Parsons won the film's second of two Oscars as Best Supporting Actress); Michael J. Pollard is an amiable curiosity as partner C.W.; and there are dandy smaller bits by Denver Pyle, Dub Taylor and Gene Wilder. The violence grows increasingly, steadily, as the film inches toward its queasy conclusion, while Penn juggles (successfully at times) ribald character moments with deadly serious--and bloody--scenes (which also became fashionable). The sweat and the flies, the downtrodden and the righteous, they all get a work-out in this scenario, which, in its best moments, has a prickly-comic and dangerous edge.

And ,however,Arthur Penn,the ""miracle worker"" succeeds !Bonnieand Clyde become rebels against the establishment,they plunder the banks but they leave their money to the poor.They live dangerously,because they've gotta get out of their lousy place with no future .They know ,to quote Hank Williams,that they'll never get out of this world alive(!),we feel it through Bonnie's poems and the character of her mother,an old lady full of dignity who plays the part of the Antique Chorus.THe members of the gang are very interesting: Moss is the caricature of Clyde,and Blanche that of Bonnie.There was another movie before which focused on Bonnie(the Bonnie Parker story),but the forerunner of Penn's movie is arguably ""Gun Crazy"".",Bonnie and Clyde
18,Quinoa1984,"one of the very best films I've ever seen? not sure, but it surely invites another viewing",10,22 March 2008,"Bonnie and Clyde is, to put it in most basic terms, what Warren Beatty said to Jack Warner when the lights came up after the screening for the late studio head after he asked Beatty, ""What the f*** did I just watch?"" Beatty replied, ""It's what the French would call an 'homage.'"" Warner's response: ""Ok... What's an homage?"" He didn't get that this was something of a kickback to movies of old while also paving the way for the future. In fact, the film was originally meant for one of the Cashiers du Cinema directors (either Truffaut or Godard, who both passed eventually), who specialized in homage. Whether or not Bonnie and Clyde is a bonafide classic- it is for critics and viewers, and not without some good reason even if I'm still a little unsure of how to place it- it does have a good chance of standing the tests of time, as people are still ranting and raving about it some forty years (and a new DVD release) later.Short of it is the 'same old story', boy meets girl, girl falls for boy, boy gets girl to rob banks, girl and boy go on the run, boy can't do well in bed with girl (wink wink, nudge nudge, say no more), boy and girl team up time to time with others on the run, girl and boy get gunned down by hundreds of machine gun bullets. The long of it is that Penn, his DP and his wonderful editor Dede Allen, and his cast and crew made up a kind of lyricism to the pulp material, that in-between the goofy interludes of fast-speed chase scenes and banjo-picking music, there were sprinklings of poetry, and candid sexual material. For the poetic part we see some shots that elevate this into another realm, moving not always on a beat to plot but based on mood and the locales (one shot I distinctly remember rises above a field of grass or grain as Bonnie goes after Clyde or other). For the sexual part, it's the first film in American history to address impotency, and a quasi-Freudian breakdown of ID manifested through the gun and crime and showmanship.And sure, some of that banjo-picking kind of dulls the thought going into Bonnie and Clyde that this will be the most cutting-edgiest of all the cutting edge late 60s movies. But Beatty and Dunaway, as the young lovers with ""nothing better to do,"" as well as Hackman and Parsons (and a cool bit part with Gene Wilder), are terrific to look at as they get at some complexities in each other's push-and-pull relationship, giving their all to portray the ballsy attitude of 30s gangsters while revealing in the uncertainty and existential abandon of their generation. Without going into too many platitudes about what the film meant or what impact it had at the time (as I didn't live at the time I can only speculate or go on past records), Bonnie and Clyde does break ground in one respect that would definitely resonate with the likes of Peckinpah, Coppola and Scorsese: violence isn't candy-coated anymore or done for an faded effect. Inspired by the likes of Kurosawa and Russian propaganda-style editing, audiences got catapulted to the kind of state of mind that meant to transport them into the danger and mayhem of the gangster life as well as, mayhap, Vietnam, particularly with the iconic climax.As pure film-making many of these scenes, especially for the latter for which Allen was snubbed a well-deserved Oscar nomination, are incredible. Emotionally it's brutal and verging on being too chaotic for its own good. Somehow Penn is able to merge the style with the emotional impact, however, which is a marker of why Bonnie and Clyde is such a success artistically. There have probably been better films to come from this, but it remains potent nevertheless.",Bonnie and Clyde

The two meet and fall for each other instantly. Bonnie sees Clyde's gun and is enamored with it. She quickly learns to shoot in a deadly perfection.The two quickly take to robbing and when they kill an officer, there is no turning back.As time goes on, they make quite a reputation for themselves. They become brazen. ""Good afternoon,"" they say.

Moss played by Michael J. Pollard, a kidnap victim, played with hilarity by Gene Wilder as well.Violent shoot-outs ensue. With a high price on their heads, the gang becomes legendary.

Arthur Penn directs.The movie involves the story of Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker during the robberies and felonies they committed on the road during the Great Depression .It starts when they meet one another and started to team up to more money by leaving their day-to-day jobs and go together on the road to committing a series of crimes from small-time heists and robbing banks as well as the tension they experience with one another.This is truly a landmark film as it tries to initiate what new things during its time of release that was new in cinema.Obviously,it was a gangster film that gave way to mob films in the future.Also,we get to see excessive features of violence in cinema.Evidently,it was also a road movie that became a cinematic formula by future movies.It also has sexual features. Finally,it also has sense of ambiguity.Overall,it was definitely a landmark Hollywood film that predates whose features became familiar in future American movies",Bonnie and Clyde
21,hitchcockthelegend,"Good afternoon, we are the Barrow gang.",10,16 January 2009,"Bonnie & Clyde stands today as one of the most important films of the 60s, it's impact on culture alone marks it out as a piece of work to note, but as gangster films go this one is something of a landmark. Quite how writers Newman & Benton managed to craft a story of two deadbeat outlaws into cinematic heroes is up for any individual viewers scrutiny, but they bloody well do it because we all want to be in the Barrow gang, because we get lost in this romanticised outlawish tale unfolding in front of our eyes.The film is a fusion of incredible violence and jaunty slapstick, and smartly pauses for delicate moments to let us into the psyche of the main protagonists. We know they have hangups, and with that we know they are fallible human beings, and this sets us up a treat for the incredible jaw dropping finale, the impact of this finale hits as hard now as it did back with the audience's of 1967.The cast are incredible, Warren Beatty gives a truly brilliant performance as Clyde, he looks good and suave tooting those guns, but it's in the tender troubled scenes where he excels supreme. Faye Dunaway as Bonnie is the perfect foil for Beatty's layers, she nails every beat of this gangsters troubled moll. Gene Hackman, Michael J Pollard and Estelle Parsons put the cherry on the icing to give depth and range to the rest of the Barrow gang, and these fine actors are clothed in gorgeous cinematography courtesy of Burnett Guffrey. To round out the plaudits I finish with love for director Arthur Penn, because it's his vision that gives us something of a nostalgic movie that plays up and down with its subjects with cheeky aplomb, in fact it's just like the banjo music that features so prominently throughout this wonderful film.Nominated for 9 Oscars it won just the two, the entire actors who played the Barrow gang were nominated, and truth be told they all would have been worthy winners, as it is they gave out just the one to the least strongest performance from Estelle Parsons, go figure. Its legacy both in culture and box office lives on and for me Bonnie & Clyde is not only one of the best films of the 60s, it's also one of the best in history. 10/10",Bonnie and Clyde
22,Doylenf,Famous criminal pair make their crimes seem like a joyride...,7,30 September 2006,"Aside from being a vivid recreation of the 1930s Depression era, this story of the world's most famous bank robbers is funny, sad, melodramatic, and ultimately tragic, in madcap fashion with lots of style and then some. No wonder it's so highly regarded as the cream of the crop when it comes to crime capers.I'm not a WARREN BEATTY fan, but this is the film that put Beatty and FAYE DUNAWAY on the map, and deservedly so. They are perfect for each other, complementing each other with great style and completely immersing themselves in the characters of Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow. ""We rob banks,"" Beatty pridefully admits when asked his vocation.It's a wild joyride and along for the ride are GENE HACKMAN, MICHAEL J. POLLARD and ESTELLE PARSONS (Oscar-winner Best Supporting Actress) and making his screen debut, GENE WILDER in a cameo role.Under Arthur Penn's direction, it still remains one of the most satisfying crime escapades ever made, notable for the controversy it aroused over that brutal ending to a life of crime.All the technical elements are perfect, making it one of the best films of its kind.",Bonnie and Clyde
23,preppy-3,Landmark film--like it or not,10,15 February 2010,"Somewhat fictionalized account of the 1930s bank robbers Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty) and Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway). It shows how they met and organized their gang including C.W. Moss (Michael J. Pollard), Clyde's brother Buck (Gene Hackman) and his annoying wife Blanche (Estelle Parsons).This was criticized when it came out for glorifying criminals and killing and attacked for using extreme (for the time) violence. First off it does NOT glorify Bonnie, Clyde or the gang for their robberies and killing people. They do have to shoot and kill people but it's not shown as anything that they like or are proud of. They have no choice in the matter and feel terrible afterwards. It DOES show them as likable, ordinary people but, considering how things end, it doesn't show it as anything to look up to. This film broke new ground in American cinema--it has perhaps the first anti-heroes ever allowed in a major motion picture. Also the violence was (for its time) VERY graphic--much more extreme than anything being shown on screen at that time. This film was attacked left and right but became a huge hit and a big boost to the careers of all the actors involved. It's now considered a masterpiece of cinema. I wouldn't go THAT far but it is a very good movie.It's beautifully directed by Arthur Penn (I'm surprised Beatty let him do that) and has a good feeling of the 1930s. The film is VERY quiet (except for the occasional shootouts) and has good performances all around. Dunaway and especially Beatty are superb. They don't seem to be acting--they ARE the characters. Pollard isn't used much here but is good. The same with Hackman. Parsons character (and voice) are extremely annoying--but she's supposed to be. The interactions are interesting and the story moves very quickly. Well worth catching just for the acting alone, but don't expect a masterpiece.",Bonnie and Clyde
24,LeonLouisRicci,Gangster Fantasy,9,10 June 2012,"Groundbreaking gangster fantasy that is larger than life and exceptionally entertaining. A divisive film with graphic violence and cartoon characters. A contrast in style that jars the senses because it all seems out of place and the pieces don't seem to fit. The result is a surreal experience that can be highly enjoyable and at the same time immensely irritating. A flighty Flatt and Scruggs banjo score counterpoints all the mayhem and the wild over the top performances punctuate the gun play. The fluff and the foul mix uneasily to serve up a stew that just might have been partially responsible for the ""studio"" swan song.A work of art and not an historical drama.

26,zardoz-13,One Hell Of A Great Crime Thriller!!!,10,9 February 2013,"""Left-Handed Gun"" director Arthur Penn's ""Bonnie & Clyde"" depicts the infamous exploits of two young Depression Era desperadoes who never scored more than $15-hundred at one time in their brief criminal career. Initially, this 112-minute crime thriller didn't raise any eyebrows, and Warner Brothers—the same studio that had pioneered gangster movies in the 1930s—was prepared to shelve it. Warren Beatty, who both starred in and produced it, convinced the studio to give the film another shot, and it became an essential classic and garnered 10 Academy Award nominations. Unfortunately, ""Bonnie & Clyde"" claimed only two Oscars. Estelle Parsons, who starred as Buck's hysterical wife, won the Best Supporting Acting Oscar, while lenser Burnett Guffy walked off with the statuette for Best Cinematography. Incidentally, Guffy had won the Oscar for his photography in the Columbia Pictures epic ""From Here to Eternity."" Of course, scenarists David Newman and Robert Benton wrote with rose-colored glasses when they chronicled these two dirt-poor bandits. Quite simply, Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow are portrayed in sympathetic terms. ""Bonnie & Clyde"" has its light moments—when Clyde holds up a bank that has gone out of business—to the violent shoot-out that claims their lives on a back road. The establishment is seen as older people who are impassive about their fate. The people who the Barrow gang rob are all mature looking. They look brutal and they aren't funning around when they either attack our hero with a meat cleaver or massacre them at roadside.""Bonnie & Clyde"" ultimately winds up punishing our eponymous heroes for their ill-gotten gains. Despite the charisma that Dunaway and Beatty generate, they are lawbreakers and they suffer the wrath of society. This makes this entertaining film a bittersweet experience because they are doomed from the moment that Bonnie suspects Clyde is out to steal her mother's automobile in the front yard of her West Dallas apartment. Nobody delivers a bad performance, and Dub Taylor is particularly memorable as the elder Moss. The early part of the action up until Bonnie catches a bullet wading across a creek is hilariously melodramatic, but as the law catches up with them, the story degenerates into a tragedy. Bonnie is a desperate young lady with no future when she encounters Clyde. Clyde robs a grocery store and they light out on a spree. Eventually, Clyde's older brother Buck (Gene Hackman) and his Baptist preacher's daughter Blanche (Estelle Parsons) joins them. Before he hooks up with his older sibling, Clyde recruits a reform school graduate, C.W. Moss (Michael J. Pollard of ""Hannibal Brooks""), who keeps their cars tuned up and road-worthy. Arthur Penn orchestrates the noisy gunfights between the Barrow gang and the local authorities with verve. The showdown where the police roll into the front yard with an armored car is especially well staged. The gun shots ring out explosively just as in the vintage Warner Brothers' crime classics. The scene with Gene Wilder is funny. You won't forget ""Bonnie & Clyde!""",Bonnie and Clyde
27,Boba_Fett1138,An essential '60's viewing.,10,22 December 2005,"This movie is among the best of the '60's. It's a definite must see due to its magnificent acting and compelling storytelling.""Bonnie and Clyde"" is a very entertaining movie and tells the somewhat changed and romanticized true story of the famous bank robbing couple and their gang. The story is brought lightly and with quite some humor which makes this movie a pleasant one to watch, even though of course the story itself is quite heavy.What makes ""Bonnie and Clyde"" truly a memorable movie, are the acting performances. Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway are truly great as Bonnie and Clyde and the supporting cast is strong. It features a young and unknown Gene Hackman and Gene Wilder. Wilder already showed his comical talent in a small and entertaining funny role in this movie. One year later he would receive real fame for playing in the movie ""The Producers"" directed by Mel Brooks.The story of the movie is very intriguing, original and interesting to follow. It's rare for a movie that you cheer for the bad guys. If it hadn't been based on a true story, ""Bonnie and Clyde"" would had been a very unbelievable and unlikely movie to watch but knowing that all of it really happened makes the movie interesting and a wonderful experience to watch.The movie beautifully recreates a '30's American atmosphere, with some fine looking cars, sets and costumes.This movie is definitely one of the must sees from the '60's and is an absolutely perfect and entertaining movie to watch, time after time.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Bonnie and Clyde

And every time I'm proved wrong.""Bonnie and Clyde"" was one of the first American movies to acknowledge that Americans are turned on by violence. People blame this movie for ushering in the increasingly graphic content of movies that in the present day makes it seem as if nothing is off limits. But this is wishful thinking on the part of people who don't want to admit that America has been a violent culture from day one. ""Bonnie and Clyde"" was a huge hit, but it's because it gave people what they wanted, not because it introduced them to something they'd never thought of before. At least in this film, you see what happens when a bullet tears through human flesh -- I can't say the same for the countless morale-boosting WWII films from the 1940s or the John Wayne westerns that are so beloved by conservative America.In the world of ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" sex and violence are extensions of the same impulse. Clyde can't get one ""gun"" to work, so he uses another. Bonnie is as restless as a cat in heat -- but Clyde won't scratch her itch, so she finds other ways of releasing tension. It's a movie that makes us identify with the killers. They're gorgeous and glamorous, but they're also vulnerable. They're Robin Hoods, justifying their crime by stealing from the rich and giving to the poor; but they're also naive in thinking that when they steal money from banks they're not also stealing from the poor rural people who use those banks. Authority figures aren't seen much in the film, but when they are, they're sadistic. Sheriff Hamer is a stony, craggy mass in comparison to the movie-star killers, and C.W. Moss's dad, who's finally the one to turn Bonnie and Clyde in, does what is right morally, but that's overshadowed by the fact that all we see him do is beat C.W. and call him white trash. It's no wonder this half-wit kid ran away with the Barrow gang in the first place. We know there's only one possible ending to the movie, yet by the time it comes, we find ourselves half hoping that Bonnie and Clyde can start over and make the American dream a reality. We've forgotten that they've killed, many times, in cold blood.The most haunting scene in the film is the one in which Bonnie visits her mother for one last time, and her mom tells her what the audience has known all along but hasn't consciously acknowledged until that point: ""You try to live within three miles of me, and you won't live long honey. You best keep runnin'."" It's one of the most chilling and effective moments I've ever seen in a movie.Grade: A+",Bonnie and Clyde
30,AlsExGal,The film at the end of the production code...,9,5 August 2021,"Because other films might have some sex and some violence in it, but this one raised the bar and opened the gates and nothing was ever the same.""Bonnie and Clyde"" set a new standard for crime films in 1967, with its scenes of intense violence that had never before been seen in American film. This somewhat fictionalized account of Depression-Era bank robbers Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker earned Oscar nominations for all five of the stars; Warren Beatty (Best Actor), Faye Dunaway (Best Actress), Gene Hackman and Michael J. Pollard (both for Best Supporting Actor), and Estelle Parsons (Best Supporting Actress), who was the only one who won, for her fine performance as Blanche.It also depicts the sexual tension between Bonnie and Clyde (its implied that he's either impotent and/or latently gay), and she's poor white trash who's never been in a meaningful relationship with a man. The final scene when Bonnie and Clyde are ambushed by machine gun fire is one of the most visually graphic death scenes in film history.It's got good character development. Bonnie and Clyde start out reckless, thinking robbery is fun, but one day they end up killing a fellow and at that point law enforcement makes them a priority. The farmers who lost their farms and homes to banks really didn't care as long as they were just taking stuff - they were considered heroes. Blanche, a timid soul, marries into more than she bargained for when she becomes a Barrow. And Denver Pyle plays s a lawman with revenge on his mind after Bonnie and Clyde capture and humiliate him. At least that was the story two years before the Summer of Love when movie goers thirsted for anti-establishment heroes. Watch the film ""The Highwaymen"" to get a truer look at what Bonnie and Clyde, and the lawman who went after them, were actually like.This was also the end of the last of the movie moguls - Jack Warner. One day, rather fed up with Warren Beatty trotting about the studio demanding this and that, Warner pointed out the studio water tower with WB on it and asked him whose initials were on that thing anyways? Beatty replied - ""Mine actually - Warren Beatty"". The right answer being Warner Brothers. At that point Jack Warner decided to retire. It just wasn't fun anymore.",Bonnie and Clyde

33,Wuchakk,Dumbaxx kids on the run with guns in the early '30s,9,11 November 2017,"RELEASED IN 1967 and directed by Arthur Penn, ""Bonnie and Clyde "" stars Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway in the titular roles chronicling the criminal exploits of the pair and their associates from 1932-1934, ending with duo's sudden execution. Michael J. Pollard plays Clyde's main accomplice C.W. Moss while Gene Hackman and Estelle Parsons play Buck & Blanche, Clyde's brother and sister-in-law. Denver Pyle appears as the Texas Ranger who tracks 'em down.The movie sticks pretty close to the facts and is generally serious, yet with an occasionally fun, bumbling tone offset by flashes of fatal violence. Some changes from the real story include W. D. Jones and Henry Methvin are combined into the character played by Pollard obviously to limit the size of the gang to five for dramatic purposes. The two main actors are way too tall for the parts. Bonnie was barely 5' feet tall and Clyde was only 5'6"". In the movie Bonnie (Faye) is 5'7"" and Clyde (Beatty) is 6'2"". To the film's credit, it shows Clyde walking with a limp and explains why: He needlessly cut off his big toe in prison and seriously injured the other one in order to get out of hard labor. I say needless because he was released early a mere week later. The fact that Barrow was willing to mutilate his body to avoid labor (or to be transferred to another facility, whatever the case) shows how desperate, impulsive and dimwitted he was as a person.Unfortunately, the movie fails to show the stoo-pid accident where Bonnie suffered severe leg wounds after being trapped in a burning vehicle. She never fully recovered and either had to be carried or walked with a limp until her death at the age of 23 (Clyde was 25 when they were executed). Another key crime not shown was the brutal (and unnecessary) shooting of two law enforcement officers by Clyde and W.D. at a dance in Oklahoma, yet the movie shows the gang killing several officers when threatened, so this can be overlooked. I think the reason they omitted this particular early crime was because Penn & gang didn't want to portray Clyde as a vicious murderer so early in the story, which would strip sympathy from viewers.Modern audiences don't realize how shocking ""Bonnie and Clyde"" was when it was released. Even by 1980 it was still pretty shocking. The script and the actors bring you into the world of the simpleton characters that are initially giddy about their wild times and fame, but over the course of the two years acquire an understandable sense of certain doom. The film starts out slow to establish the main players and the bloody realities of their misguided lifestyle are mainly saved for the last act. Although Dunaway and Beatty are way too tall for the roles, they deliver the goods. Not to mention, Pollard's notable performance as C.W. (W.D. was merely 16 during the crime spree).To balance out the story, I encourage you to see 1992's ""Bonnie & Clyde: The True Story,"" which is another quality version of the real-life crime spree.THE MOVIE RUNS 111 minutes and was shot mostly in east Texas, but also S.

It somehow comes out from nowhere. That's impressive. And it's that almost balletic (really no better word for it) bullet-riddling scene that really stands out. The rest is oddly inconsistent. Beatty and Dunaway do a great job bringing the thrill-seekers to life, but the tone varies from serious to comedy, and they don't always fit together. Actually, they seldom fit.

Part of the problem here seems to be how amazing the film seemed upon its original release. The naturalistic filming with sunshine and cornfields mixed in with the blood and bullets was something never really seen before and I think we were thrilled to see so much violence and yet for everything to seem to carefree. Now, so many years later, and we are more used to realistic displays of terrible, gut wrenching violence, this seems to playful, even wistful. I found it hard, indeed impossible, to connect with these silly hooligans and their complete lack of regard for everyone around them.

37,StevePulaski,The film that helped kickstart the Hollywood we cherish,9,23 July 2014,"Despite being almost fifty years old, Arthur Penn's gangster classic Bonnie and Clyde possesses a beautifully modern style and look to it, in terms of cinematography and tone. While adhering to the principles of its genre, the film is fearless in going off on its own tangents and writing its own rules, with two career-worthy performances by two screen legends, and wraparound ideas of self-condemnation rather than directorial condemnation.The film needs no real introduction, but a simple plot outline can't hurt. It's Great Depression-era America, numerous banks have either failed or have been cleaned out completely, the public is pessimistic, with many having just witnessed their financial future evaporate right before their very eyes. The setting is Southwest America, and we meet Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty), a man just released on good behavior after committing an armed robbery, just as he is getting acquainted with Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway), a southern belle who works as a waitress. Clyde buys the two some Cokes, as they make small talk, with Clyde effortlessly defining Bonnie as a person just by the vibes she accentuates.Clyde recognizes that Bonnie seems unhappy in her current slog and proves to her that he still has the gumption and nerve to conduct a slick stickup before bailing, to which Bonnie finds admirable and brave. Once Clyde proves he still has it, the two set off on a violent pursuit of the American Dream, going to places in one car, but leaving in another, conducting numerous stickups, and picking up other misfits along the way. One of the people they meet is C.W. Moss (Michael J. Pollard), a gas station attendant, who wants to prove to the two that he can be just as dangerous as them. What unfolds is a cinematic road trip involving gruesome murders, devilishly entertaining violence, and ample amounts of visual style and flair.Bonnie and Clyde was originally conceived to be directed by one of the many French New Wave directors at the time in efforts to try and bring new styles to Hollywood as well as have lesser-known, French directors achieve a namesake in the peak of their careers in America. Famous French directors such as François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard were the original choices to direct, but both dropped out either pursuing other projects or disagreeing with parts of the film. The final product plays like an American take on French New Wave styles, toying with the idea of profiling and glorifying criminal behavior in a fashion Godard would in his films like Band of Outsiders and Breathless. It's interesting to note how Godard's films went on to achieve monstrous critical acclaim, while, before Bonnie and Clyde could bask in that realm, it had to endure conversations and debates on the acceleration of violence in American cinema.Yes, Bonnie and Clyde is a very violent film, often showcasing shootouts between the titular criminals and the law in a spontaneous, blink-and-you-miss-it manner that keeps one always engaged and never bored. Yet there's an element of sensuality to the film that doesn't always get mentioned in a conversation about the film. Consider the scene in the beginning when Bonnie is walking to work and Clyde, in a tireless pursuit of personal satisfaction, tries to convince Bonnie on his persona and who he really is - a charismatic crook. He gets her to fondle his gun before showing her what he can do with it. Then consider the scene when Clyde has a hard time having sex with Bonnie, despite her ravishing beauty and innocent facial expressions. Whether he's impotent or unsatisfied, the film never says, but in a later scene involving C.W. Moss, even a threeway is subtly hinted at between him, Bonnie, and Clyde, subtly, but evidently, implying that Clyde could in fact be bisexual or in fact homosexual. Such elements go unnoticed in the presence of great violence, which is why, I feel, it has taken longer for Bonnie and Clyde to be talked about without constantly referring to the graphic violence.Last but not least are the performances by Beatty and Dunaway, both of whom exercising their characters' most apparent traits in ways that are equal parts stimulating as they are commendable. Beatty plays slick and charismatic to a tee, while the gorgeous and sensational Dunaway uses more than her looks to get by. Dunaway has the tricky role here, playing a female character who is teetering on the edge of satisfaction and insanity. Once her character meets Beatty's, however, it's all downhill for her and she begins to show a closeted drive that seems to be less about fulfilling a quick spout of bad behavior, but almost psychologically pleasing for her id, resulting in a performance that is complex enough to illustrate her emotional gap.Bonnie and Clyde, along with Mike Nichols' extraordinary Graduate, were kickoffs to the movement in American cinema called ""New Hollywood,"" which attracted the young generation with its relatable stories, graphic violence, special effects, grittiness, and interesting ideas that didn't seem so encased in the same world of unrealistic happiness that the 1930's - 1950's mainstream films, such as musicals, were. What unleashed were untameable films that didn't feel like disguising the often moral ugliness of the world, with directors such as Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Brian De Palma, and Clint Eastwood taking the forefront in the movement. Bonnie and Clyde couldn't have been a better start to such a bold movement nor could it have better represented what the era was really about.",Bonnie and Clyde
38,Smells_Like_Cheese,Essential film from the 60's and in any film fanatic's list of what a terrific movie is,9,24 November 2005,"I have heard so much about ""Bonnie and Clyde"", it's sickening. First off, in my old film class, the professor talked about ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and how popular it was. Then here on IMDb obviously, this a pretty big hit. Then I went to the book store recently and saw a book called ""1001 movies you should see before you die"" and this was in it! Then also I was reading in ""Premeire Magazine"", they had an article about the most shocking moments in history, and one of the scenes is mentioned in here. I had to see this film and I knew that my mom had it.It blew me away, not literally. But you know what I mean; this was just a terrific movie. Warren and Faye had such chemistry and a click on screen that it was difficult not to love them. Even though they were killers, you root for them and their whole gang. See, the strange thing is, I think a lot of the viewers would agree that they never really meant to get into killing, in this film particularly, they just freaked out and did what a lot of people would do in a snap reaction. The story is very cool and the acting is so old school, you can't help but fall in love with this masterpiece. I highly recommend.9/10",Bonnie and Clyde
39,blanbrn,A classic. A fun and feel good film to view!,8,30 March 2008,"I don't know how historically accurate or correct that this film is to the real life story of ""Bonnie and Clyde"", but one thing is for sure it makes for a very fun and enjoyable viewing! At it's time in 1967 the film was a milestone, now it's considered a classic and certainly for the action paced drama and black hearted humor it held up. ""Bonnie and Clyde"" pushed the envelope at it's time not only just because of it's historical legendary tale of two outlaws it also for 1967 was one of the more violent and bloody films to come out.Set in the early 1930's in Texas and some of the west in the depression era it begins with two drifters Clyde Barrow(Warren Beatty)who's an ex con just released from prison for armed robbery and Bonnie Parker(Faye Dunaway)who's just a pretty small town Texas blond who wants to escape the world of being a waitress. And from the beginning of the film the pair hook up and embark on a life of crime only to build up one by one to bigger and better bank robberies. Though the film is very violent for 1967 it portrays the crimes as fun and full of adventure, it's well blended with romance and sexual tension between the two central characters as both Beatty and Dunaway look as if though they had a field day playing Clyde and Bonnie respectively. The Barrow gang expands when more partners in crime come as Gene Hackman gives an over the top performance as Beatty's brother and his wife played by Estelle Parsons brings caution and slow witted humor to the gang. And worth a note is Michael J. Pollard's supporting performance as a partner in crime helper.Director Arthur Penn does the film as rough and gritty but he keeps it humble. The shootouts, chase scenes, and slang talk combined with the playing of banjo music all during the film and the cops and robbers and wild west attitude style make this a classic thrilling ride of brilliance and grace. Beatty not only produced but his portrayal of outlaw Clyde Barrow was first class work at a time when he was the movies new stud. Also at the time in 1967 the performance here of Faye Dunaway is very sexy and ravishing with her innocent but beautiful look, her performance makes her the ""It"" girl of 1967. Overall this is probably one of the better films of the 60's it's well paced and blended well with feel good fun and escape topped off with super performances from Beatty and Dunaway it's clearly worth many viewings.",Bonnie and Clyde
40,DKosty123,Love On The Run With Guns & Money,8,22 August 2009,"This movie was the main film that made Warren Beatty a bankable star in Hollywood. This is his breakout role at age 30. It established Faye Dunaway as a star too. Gene Hackman was just getting started here & his better roles would come later but this one was good experience for him.Wonderfully filmed & extremely popular when it came out, this film highly fictionalized the story of the real robbers. They simplified the Bonnie & Clyde characters down to 3 basic words the film is remembered for, ""We Rob Banks."" Set in the Depression era where banks were considered the bad guys often as they were failing & taking peoples money, this film shows little sympathy for the banks being robbed.The film does touch on many peoples plights back in the depression era. Mostly though, this film sold tickets because it has a major anti-government & anti-establishment theme it embellishes throughout. This theme fit 1967 audiences perfectly as the Anti-Vietnam War sentiment made audiences sympathize with the situation Bonnie & Clyde lived in as the establishment was doing little to help people cope with depression era problems.Another theme which resonates through this film is an anti-media theme. Several times especially late in the film, Clyde mentions stories published in the media which were totally false blaming them for crimes they had nothing to do with. This conspiracy theme resonated with 60's audiences too as between the JFK murder & Anti-Vietnam building due to horrible media images being put on the news, there was a feeling of fate & hopelessness in the United States then.The ending of the film even fits these themes as you feel fate closing in on Bonnie & Clyde. The police are presented as cold-hearted killers who have decided to gun them down in a series of traps & are presented as doing so with ruthless precision. The violence is very convincing on screen though one of the few technical flaws is Bonnie being hit in the left shoulder in one scene & then having a sling on her right arm in the next sequence.While the film is not perfect, this is a very well made film. If a remake of this comes along, I hope they go closer to the real story. This one while entertaining is quit a bit off the mark. While Beatty & Dunaway are good, the writers need to go closer to the real people & away from (as the movie correctly points out) the incorrect image of Bonnie & Clyde painted by depression era media & law enforcement.",Bonnie and Clyde
41,Red-Barracuda,This was the beginning of something new,7,7 April 2013,"Producer/star Warren Beatty went out on a limb to release Bonnie and Clyde. At the time it was controversial for the new levels of mainstream screen violence it introduced, for portraying the criminal protagonists as sympathetic doomed heroes and its frank complex sexuality. This was quite a concoction for a Hollywood movie. As it turned out, it was a catalyst. It effectively ushered in the era of Hew Hollywood. This was a relatively brief period when personal director-led pictures were systematically released by the big studios. It was a golden period for film where many challenging movies were made in Hollywood. The commercial success of Bonnie and Clyde and the way in which it tapped into the youth market were factors that ultimately set New Hollywood in motion. It was one of the first big American films that could truly be described as a product of the counterculture.The story is a romanticised account of the bank robbers Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker. It was a complete revision of the crime genre. Up to this point gangster flicks were relatively straightforward in their 'crime does not pay' message. And while in Bonnie and Clyde the protagonists do die in the end, it is an ending that leaves questions about who really are the good guys. The criminals are effectively portrayed as likable anti-heroes throughout. The system in which they operate in is consistently questioned as stacked against ordinary people. So when Bonnie and Clyde do eventually meet their demise it is the result of a trick, taking advantage of their good intentions. They stop to help a friend fix his truck but they have been double-crossed and are gunned down by lawmen hiding in nearby bushes. It's the authorities who win but in a deeply underhand and inglorious manner. In this way, the movie tapped into a widespread distrust that the public had with authority back in the late 1960's. Vietnam and police brutality were current problems at this time and Bonnie and Clyde connected with these issues.It was an American genre film but it was influenced by the European New Wave. The fuzzy morality, the naturalistic performances and the loose and dynamic cinematography were all features of those European movies. It was also a star-making vehicle. Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway became premier movie stars on the back of this. Both these actors would become key participants of several of the best New Hollywood films over the following decade. So the historical significance of this film is impossible to argue against. It was ultimately superseded by other gangster films and other movies from the New Hollywood. But never forget, this is where American films changed forever.",Bonnie and Clyde
42,Rainey-Dawn,A Romantic Crime Adventure,8,25 June 2014,"A very good film account of the notorious Bonnie and Clyde. The movie may not be a 100% perfect depiction of what exactly happened but I am sure it is close enough to the real story Bonnie and Clyde that most people will not squawk about it.Yes the movie is a bit romanticized, but then again, Bonnie and Clyde were lovers so romanticizing the movie does seem to fit the film.Bonnie and Clyde is a romantic adventurous crime-drama that is a bit exciting to watch. It's a good Sunday afternoon film that movie buffs should watch when they can get around to it.8.5/10",Bonnie and Clyde
43,OllieSuave-007,Semi-Classic crime story.,6,16 August 2014,"This is a crime story about the notorious and violent, yet romantically involved small-town girl (Fay Dunaway) and a small-time bank robber (Warren Beatty). Their string of violent robberies gripped the Mid-West in the Depression era.I remembered watching this movie on TV when I was a teenager and, from what I recall, it has some intense old gangster violence and action. However, we are asked to sympathize with the movie's two character leads and antagonists, as it concentrated on their lives on the run and their romantic involvement, which I thought didn't ultimately make the film exciting. The acting was OK for the most part and the Depression era visual effects were nicely done. But overall, what I got out of the movie was a slow, dragged out story of two fugitives with over the top drama and lesser action.Grade C",Bonnie and Clyde
44,sddavis63,"Over-Rated, But It Does Overcome A Rather Dull Start",4,23 February 2010,"In all honesty, Warren Beatty's movies strike me as either over-rated, pointless or dull - and always pretentious. Beatty always comes across as if he's trying to teach us something; or do something noble. He also comes across as somewhat self-serving. Personally, I think of him as one of the most over-rated people in Hollywood history. For more than half its run time, I would certainly put Bonnie & Clyde into both the ""over- rated"" and ""dull"" categories, although by the time it ends, it has overcome that second flaw, anyway. There are hints of a character study throughout - Clyde Barrow's apparent impotence (at least as implied in the film) is hinted at as a reason for his general frustration with life. Bonnie strikes me as just a young woman bored with life in a small town, looking for excitement. To me, the first half of the movie had a general sense of silliness to it, and concerns itself with some Bonnie & Clyde legends rather than with the facts. On the other hand, the second half of the movie is pretty good. There are several good shoot-out scenes, leading up to the climactic ambush by the police. To give credit, Beatty was pretty good as Clyde, and Faye Dunaway did a good job as Bonnie. Gene Hackman was decent in a supporting role as Clyde's brother Buck.There's no history lesson here. The portrayal of the gang is misleading - Bonnie and Clyde had far more ""associates"" than portrayed in this movie. For whatever reason, Hollywood seems to like to give an almost noble view of these criminal types. Bonnie & Clyde murdered both cops and civilians - they were hardly nice folk, and yet they're portrayed by Beatty in an almost Robin Hood style. In one scene depicting a bank robbery, they don't steal money from a farmer because it's his money; they only steal from the bank. Even if the money was on deposit with the bank, though, whose money would they have been stealing?The stronger second half made me feel better about watching this, and it's not Beatty's worst movie by a long shot - high praise from someone like me who frankly doesn't care much for the man's work. 4/10",Bonnie and Clyde
45,Robert_duder,One of those vital films that changed the face of Hollywood and biopics forever,8,12 June 2014,"To be honest, I stayed away from Bonnie and Clyde on purpose for years. I was waiting in eager anticipation for the opportunity to see it on the big screen and finally that opportunity arose. My expectations were decently high because any time anyone talks about this film they refer to it as though it is a movie changing experience. It is exactly that. On the surface level as sheer entertainment, it is good. But when you look at that importance of the film, what they accomplished and what it meant you begin to see the true greatness of this classic. I watch a lot of classic film especially in the last couple of years and as great as most of them are a lot of them don't hold up well over time. Bonnie and Clyde holds up so well and never once feels dated. In fact, because it pioneered something in its style, visceral and nearly shocking content, it could have easily been made today and still shock some. It is the most twisted romance you could ever seen. The heart of the film really is this bizarre relationship between Bonnie and Clyde. Everything else is the backdrop. The gritty scenery of the deep South, the wild and unhinged behaviour and the detail they touch on when creating Bonnie and Clyde doesn't go unnoticed. It feels real, it feels shocking and it feels downright disturbing. Its such a sad and twisted story and you are right there to witness all of it. Never once did I feel compassion for them. I never felt they were being painted as heroes but rather tragic figures of history.Warren Beatty fits this role just like a glove. He becomes Clyde Barrow. It isn't even the type of role that is in your face or bowls you over but its a subtle performance and its the little things about it that makes you realize by the end how brilliant it is. Beatty's facial expressions, the limp, the look in his eyes...he just completely lets this role pour out of him and its obvious why its iconic. Faye Dunaway is the iconic Bonnie Parker. Dunaway is fantastic in the role and actually brings the character to life in a very similar way to Beatty. The beauty of it is though the chemistry between the two of them. Its twisted and disturbing and yet you almost understand this fatal attraction. They try and touch on some of the more important aspects of their relationship but there is so much story here. Both of them absolutely deserve the classic status their performances have gotten. Without either of them this would have been a very different (and probably not as effective) film. Michael J. Pollard, the amazing Gene Hackman, and Estelle Parsons all bring their various characters to life in different ways. Parsons is excruciatingly irritating exactly like she is meant to be (a portrayal the real Blanche didn't care for.) Hackman and Beatty are sizzling opposite each other as the killer Barrow boys. Pollard could have used some more depth to his character but its a vital role and he does it well. Denver Pyle is decent but painfully predictable as the tough old Texas Marshal who finally gets his vengeance against Bonnie and Clyde.Haunting, beautiful, disturbing and shocking, this film leaves nothing to the imagination. The first time a man is shot in the face and it still feels shocking so imagine what it was like then. Director Arthur Penn obviously cared very much for this film and the historical aspect. There are so many urban legends about the two infamous killers and bank robbers and the film tries to at least scratch the surface of some of those rumours which isn't easy to do. It is likely one of those films that by sheer magic/miracle or fate everything clicks about it. The chemistry, the script, the cinematography, the cast...everything feels iconic. It wasn't perfect for me. I thought sometimes it dragged just a little bit and we do see a lot of the same material again and again because of the nature of the story. They were bank robbers and they hid from the law. That's not to say I was bored for even a moment. This is true gangster flick glory so if you like that style...Bonnie and Clyde is the epitome of that. It is an absolute must see and I will be adding it to my personal collection. Over time I think I will only learn to appreciate it more. 8.5/10",Bonnie and Clyde
46,ElMaruecan82,The movie that defined the 'New Hollywood' generation and the greatest cinematic era ...,10,27 June 2011,"She's restlessly lying in bed, naked, like a capricious girl her parents just punished, impatiently waiting for 'something to happen'. The monotony is eventually broken when the beautiful blonde girl catches a handsome young man about to steal her family's car. When a bored girl meets a strange newcomer, it's not properly what we'd call a 'love at first sight' but there's obviously a mutual attraction, fascination. And the man has more than his dandy charm to offer, from his pockets he carefully unveils a gun that the girl sensually touches like a phallic trophy. The days of 'old-school' cinema are numbered.But showing a gun is one thing, the guy must use it to assess his manhood, so he robs a store and runs away with the girl, and they finally exchange their names. Warren Beatty is Clyde Barrow and Faye Dunaway is Bonnie Parker, the rest is legend  The two young lovers escape from their condition in a sort of existential impulse and leave the boredom of small rural towns behind them. No place in their hearts for the Great Depression. And you can easily draw the parallel between ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and cinematic history. When the gap between the baby-boom generation and their parents got wider, when cinema was marked in the 60's by an abundance of dull musical comedies and classic block-busters, when sex and violence were still taboo in America, I guess people felt like Bonnie in the opening shot ... before two guys, Michael Benton and David Benton, came up with a script, recommended by the French New Wave authority, François Truffaut himself. Then Arthur Penn made his entrance with a gangster film that exuded violence and sexuality in an unusually indecent way, during the ground-breaking year of 1967. A cinematic Revolution was marching in.""Bonnie and Clyde"" was a break-through film in its fast paced, entertaining and bold portrayal of violence and sex. The times of ""Cleopatra"", ""My Fair Lady"" or ""The Sound of Music"" were definitely over, American cinema reached its maturity with Arthun Penn's masterpiece that consecrated the anti-heroic figures, a model that would enrich the 'New Hollywood' era with some of its greatest and most iconic characters. We root for Bonnie and Clyde as they are the epitome of anti-system rebellion. And never seems their violence gratuitous or cold-blooded. We're far from the John Wayne's stud figure with Clyde who obviously uses his gun to compensate his sexual problems, or to impress his girlfriend. And in the famous pivotal moment, where they meet the farmers ruined by their bank, they're transformed into modern 'Robin Hoods'. Indeed, the iconic line ""We rob banks"" is more than a simple statement; it's the affirmation of this rebellion against the system. It's pretty ironic that Penn 'sold' the film to Warner Bros majors as a homage to the gangster films of the Golden Age, which is not totally untrue, except for the Hayes Code from which film-makers were freed in 1967.Maybe we could blame Arthur Penn's for the liberties he took with the characterization of notorious gangsters, and the deliberately romantic portrayal of Beatty and Dunaway. Maybe Bonnie is too gorgeous in a glamorous way, maybe Clyde is too good-hearted as he would express many grieves all through the film, highlighting the fact that he feels as much a killer as a lover. But take into consideration that for a long time, the Hayes Code prevented bandits and gangsters from being portrayed in a sympathetic way, except maybe for comedy. This is why analyzing ""Bonnie and Clyde"" should always take the context into consideration. In these days, when Americans were getting killed in Vietnam for a war that was proving to be pointless, who could really point his finger in something and say 'this is good and this is evil'? The Vietnam war made the youth question its own approach to good and evil, and it's less an alibi to root for Bonnie and Clyde, than an element that explains, not justifies, how their figures could have been so popular. The audience was mature enough to identify with ""Bonnie and Clyde"" as movie characters.And to be honest, it's hard not to find this film appealing, as soon as the gang is constituted by its core before being joined by Michael J. Pollard, as C.W. Moss, Gene Hackman as the good-hearted brother Buck Barrow and Estelle Parsons as his wife Blanche (with an interesting note that all the members of the Barrow Gang will be Oscar nominated), the whole film embarks us in a road adventure with the banks of the Depressed America as so many stops, and the same exhilarating banjo music as the film's musical signature. It's difficult not to feel like belonging to the gang, seated in the numerous cars they ran away with. Dede Allen's fast-paced editing provides unforgettable thrills, reasonably punctuated by necessary and relationship-developing pauses. But progressively, as the adventure is looking more like a cat-and-mouse chase, as we feel getting closer to the end, the levels of realism the violence reaches gets more and more disturbing, and heart-breaking, as to remind us that whoever lived by the gun, die by the gun, and antiheroes didn't have the monopoly of violence.Indeed, the movie doesn't end with banjo music, with no music actually and this is another testimony to the movie's legendary value, something that was waiting to explode on screens after so many decades of repressed violence, where gunshots hardly made blood spilling, where the portrayal of death was just acrobatic moves with a possible 'aargh' for the bad guy and more solemnity for the good one. Arthur Penn opened the Pandora Box that would inspire ""The Wild Bunch"", ""The French Connection"" and ""The Godfather"" and only for that cinematic accomplishment, he deserves respect and admiration. ""Bonnie and Clyde"" is a landmark and definitely one of the most important films of American history.",Bonnie and Clyde
47,paul2001sw-1,Gangster western,6,28 January 2006,"'Bonnie and Clyde', the true story of two murdering robbers in 1930s America, bears similarities to 'Badlands', Terrence Mallick's tale of a not dissimilar pair in 1970s America. But it's a less strong movie. Whereas 'Badlands' probed into the psychology of alienation, 'Bonnie and Clyde' is a more straightforward piece of storytelling, the relatively simple tale of a young couple who head out into the west to have some fun, fun which takes them on a murderous and ultimately fatal trip. There's nothing particularly wrong with the film, but it lacks the sense of depth that might have given it a real edge. In the final analysis, its protagonists just aren't that interesting. Best considered as a time-shifted western, it doesn't really live up to its classic status.",Bonnie and Clyde
48,MOscarbradley,Ripe for Reassessment,10,6 September 2006,"When Arthur Penn's Thirties-set gangster movie first appeared in 1967 it was like a breath of fresh air in the American cinema, (though to be fair, on hindsight, the American cinema in the previous few years, particularly in the Independent sector, wasn't doing too badly). Still, Penn's movie seemed to break new ground and not just in it's depiction of violence. It had a lyrical intensity that belonged more to the French New Wave, (and at one time Truffaut's name was associated with the project), and, in that it took back to the American cinema the trappings that the French had originally borrowed in films like ""A Bout De Soufflé"" and ""Shoot the Pianist"", seemed to square the circle.In the intervening years it has fallen somewhat out of fashion. It now almost seems quaintly old-fashioned, it's form more classically structured and narratively driven than might first appeared. But there are virtues that have largely been overlooked. Like ""The Graduate"" which came out in the same year, it is a young person's film yet it burns with a fierce intelligence that is conspicuously absent from similar films today. I suppose you could say the film has a pop-art sensibility, (a close-up of Faye Dunaway's face, lips burning bright red, could come from a Lichtenstein poster), and its cast seem unnaturally young, (only Beatty had established a persona for himself at the time; the others had yet to establish a reputation), but they became stars because of it. (Gang members Parsons and Pollard didn't make the leap; they were character actors from the start). Arguably you could say Beatty, Dunaway, Hackman, Parsons and Pollard were never to better their work here. They may have equalled it but their performances were definitive.Arthur Penn, too, was never to make another movie as good. The film's extraordinary critical and popular success gave Penn the freedom to tackle 'weightier' material, but ""Little Big Man"" and ""Georgia's Friends"" now seem misguided attempts at solemnity, while even his brilliant western ""The Missouri Breaks"" seems to succeed more for it's oddness rather than it's originality. Perhaps ""Bonnie and Clyde"" was a one-off though it did spawn an awful lot of break-neck thrillers and up-dated film-noirs, and was more responsible for the baby-boom in movies in the seventies than ""Easy Rider"" which followed it two years later. It remains a film ripe for reassessment.",Bonnie and Clyde
49,Pjtaylor-96-138044,They fought the law...,7,15 January 2021,"This recreation of the notorious crime spree of its eponymous real-life bank robbers/ killers sees its crooks brought to life with an unusual amount of nuance and, even, empathy. 'Bonnie And Clyde (1967)' isn't interested in judging its central criminals (that's reserved for the audience), instead it aims to tell a rounded and engaging tale surrounding the tragedy of their lives. What that tragedy is exactly is up for debate: is it the way that their journey ends or is it the fact that the pair felt that journey necessary in the first place? Either way, the picture constantly plays with an underlying sense of dread and is surprisingly compelling because of it. This ominous vibe is bolstered by the fact that most people know how this tale comes to a close, especially considering that its final scene is now one of the most famous in all of cinema. Still, it's a tale worth watching. It does contain envelope-pushing violence and has moments of brutality that still hit relatively hard today, but bloodshed and bank robberies aren't all there is to the narrative. Its characters, as I've mentioned, are rather well-rounded and somehow avoid being repulsive despite their often repulsive behaviour. Its themes are also somewhat resonant, too. For example, its commentary on the fact that the media tends to sensationalise anti-social behaviour and can, in some cases, make it seem appealing to an audience of already disillusioned citizens is still highly relevant today, as is its examination of 'infamy' and how bad behaviour is often rewarded with more attention than good behaviour. Ultimately, the movie is an engaging and entertaining experience right the way through. It's more contemplative than you may expect and it ultimately manages to just about stay on the right side of its inherent ethical quandary. It's a seminal piece of work for a reason. 7/10",Bonnie and Clyde
50,Irishchatter,Good movie but it didn't get the facts right!,6,14 November 2015,"I did enjoy it but most of what happened really wasn't true. The real Bonnie Parker had brown short hair not long blond hair. It might have been best if they got a brown headed girl instead of a blond one. I have to say Faye Dunaway is very beautiful and a very talented actress but I didn't think she suited the role. Then in the film, at the scene where the police killed the notorious couple, they truly weren't killed beside C.W. Moss' father, they were killed together in a quiet road in Louisana!I thought it was kinda dumb that the film crew didn't make an effort in trying to make this film true. I felt like I was watching an entertaining gangster movie instead. I wouldn't call this a disappointing film but it was mediocre..",Bonnie and Clyde

But instead of calling the cops, she decides to come with him on a cross-country crime spree.Together with Clyde's brother (Gene Hackman) and his wife (Estelle Parsons), Bonnie and Clyde gain national notoriety with ever bank they knock over. But a tenacious Texas Ranger (Denver Pyle) is determined to bring them down hard.With gripping performances and insight into their relationship, this 1967 version of the Great Depression's star-crossed criminals still stands as the best cinematic depiction of their bloody rampage.

53,kenjha,Dunaway Shines,8,4 July 2010,"The story of the titular 1930s bank robbers is romanticized, making them out to be basically good kids. Beatty is OK but somewhat bland as Clyde. Dunaway, on the other hand, is fabulous, really sinking her teeth into the role of a bored young woman looking for some excitement. Parsons won an Oscar, but it was undeserved as she is quite annoying as Hackman's screeching wife. The sets look authentic. Penn goes a bit overboard with his artistic direction, including a pretentious dream-like sequence where Bonnie visits her mother. This was an influential American film for its landmark violence, but it's hardly the great classic many make it out to be.",Bonnie and Clyde
54,sol-,My brief review of the film,9,2 December 2005,"The title characters are two persons with nothing much to lose, and the film sets out to follow them around. The way the film is photographed helps achieve this objective, with the moving camera-work following the characters around, using a range of different angles to keep the film looking interesting. It is generally a solid film - except when it tries to add comedy to the tale. The bouncy music jars against the drama on screen, and the only purpose of the subplot involving Gene Wilder and Evans Evans seems to be comedy effect. Estelle Parsons was the only member of the cast to win an Academy Award for her performance, but she is the weakest link in the cast, overplaying her role, always screaming and complaining, insomuch as her character does not seem realistic. Of the rest of the cast, Warren Beatty is the best as the charismatic Clyde, but not far behind is Michael J. Pollard who has some very solid scenes during the second half. It is meandering film, with nowhere to go, but it is not much more meandering than the lives of its characters are. There is a need to suspend disbelief too, as credibility goes out the window with the compression of events. There are some very well edited scenes - particularly towards the end and start of the film - but otherwise it seems a bit frantic at times, especially during the action scenes that may have been new in its day but are standard stuff these days. The film has a reputation as one of the best films of its year, and it is certainly a good film. There are some things than can be picked on, but they do not add up to much. Following around characters who stumble before succeeding is interesting for the most part, and the technical side, as well as the acting, keep the film going.",Bonnie and Clyde
55,redryan64,"Hailed as an example of Hollywood's Brave, New, Brutally Realistic and Violent Cinema; the Barrow Gang provided all film makers with a new Zenith to aim for.",10,19 March 2008,"There was a time in the History of the United States when the institution of the Rail Road and the fancy dudes who ran them, called either Tycoons or Moguls, were none too popular with the general populace. Perhaps it was the cozy relationship that they enjoyed with the Politicos of their day; or maybe it was the high-handed methods that the different companies used to gain the Right-of-Way to expand operations from Coast to Coast, from Sea to Shining Sea.These factors were sure influential in casting common Outlaws and Robbers such as Butch, Sundance and Jesse James as some sort of god-like folk heroes to the commoners. Anyone who did any harm to the bad, old guys with the reins of the 'Iron Horse' was automatically some sort of courageous Rebel; standing up to tyrannical treatment and looking out for all. It was a simple example of that time-honored tradition and old custom of viewing, ""the Enemy of my Enemy is my Friend."" SO in the 1930's we would naturally substitute the Financial Institutions, namely the Banks, as being the Culprit instead of the Pennsylvania, the B & O, the Reading and the Short Line RR's. The Bank was vilified for a couple of reasons. First of all, it was the banks who would be the one to foreclose on one's property; which may well have been a family run farm that has been owned by the very same family for years and generations. The feelings of confusion, total frustration and angst were made even more muddled by the eviction strings' being pulled by a large banking interest, miles and miles away.All of this followed the ""Roaring 20's"", which had Rival groups of 'Gangsters' battled for 'turfs' and the 'rights' to do the illicit supplying of Bootleg Beer, Bath Tub Gin, Prostitution and 'Loud Talking & Giggling' in line. This was mostly a sort of well to do criminal enterprise; which all ended with the Repeal of Prohibition in 1933, supposedly.* There was a big difference between the Bank Robbers and their Organized Crime City thug counterparts. Perhaps it is best explained by a scene in THE PETRIFIED FOREST (Warner Brothers, 1936). In it the John Dillinger-like character Duke Mantee (Humphrey Bogart) was referred to as a 'Gangster'. Near-by character, Gramp Maple (Charley Grapwin) retorts: ""Duke Mantee ain't no Gangster; he's a Desperado (pronounced Des-puh-ray-do)! Gangsters is Foreigners (Fur-rin-ehrs)."" Well anyway, they sure weren't the same breed of cat!With the high-handed treatment and the terrible financial conditions of the early '30's Depression Era USA, these Hot-Rodding, Blood-Thirsty and Machine Gun Happy took on the totally false reputation of being some sort of latter-day Robin Hoods. This was patently false; but with the Nation's Newspapers afforded extensive coverage to their exploits and this surely magnified the appeal of the common moron, thug murderer and stick-up man.And to this end, our feted, Classic Film endeavor, BONNIE AND CLYDE (Tatira-Hiller Prod. /Warner Brothers-7 Arts, 1967) starts out sort of slow and full of whimsical levity. Bank Robbery appeared to be fun, a lark, a real blast. But the mood changes abruptly and for the rest of the film during a bank robbery that goes not quite as planned. After getting the proceeds at gunpoint, everything seems to go wrong for the young couple. The get-away car is out of position. There are parked cars where they shouldn't be. And they actually get some resistance from folks at the bank. The whole scene is fast-paced and provokes the audience to a great fit of collective belly-laugh; then someone from the Bank jumps up on their auto's running board, only to be shot right in the face by Clyde. When the front passenger's side window is splattered with the victim's blood; the mood suddenly becomes ever so somber.The scene and sequence of events here are expertly woven into one great Roller-Coaster of a scene; with all the ups and downs, twists and turns that any 'Bobs' or 'Space Mountain'** could ever throw at us. Then suddenly, it's an abrupt stop and a return to Earth and Reality. It's a most remarkably performed and really puts the viewer into contact with what the whole point of the story really is.The storyline is very close to Historical Fact, as far as we can tell. Like any fictionalized account of real historical occurrences, the screenplay takes certain license in an attempt to avoid getting all bogged down with additional characters, unimportant incidents and unnecessary facts. All these would only serve to extend the already 116 minute movie and ultimately confuse people like you, me and Schultz. Am I right Schultz? The Film is very violent in some sequences and the most brutal scene is the final ride by Bonnie Parker & Clyde Barrow; as they are ambushed by that Frank Hamer led posse. That particular scene is incredible in its visually splendid story telling and its cold, brutally honest portrayal of just how the murderous pair was finally dealt with.Warner Bros./7 Arts presents a Tatira-Hiller Production, BONNIE AND CLYDE.

56,Thanos_Alfie,Simply Bonnie and Clyde...,7,27 January 2014,"""Bonnie and Clyde"" is a classic movie which has to do with a notorious violent bank robber couple and their gang. In this movie we can observe many great interpretations such as Warren Beatty's who plays really outstanding as Clyde Barrow and Faye Dunaway's who is also plays outstanding as Bonnie Parker (nominated for the Oscar for Best Actress in a Leading Role on 1967). I also liked the interpretation of Gene Hackman who plays as Buck Barrow.I think that ""Bonnie and Clyde"" is a must seen movie and everyone have to see it. With this movie you will understand how the cinema changed and you will also understand why. Finally I have to tell you that this movie is really great and if you like the old movies then I'm sure that you will love it.",Bonnie and Clyde
57,johnnyboyz,A film that has remained the best of its kind; despite the imitators.,9,4 January 2008,"It's astonishing to think this film was made in the 1960s. Such raw realism and attention to detail and subject matter is what makes Bonnie and Clyde the film it is and is the reason it has aged so well after all this time. Here is a film that has spawned many-a copy in the form of Natural Born Killers but do not get onto Tarantino's back as I'm sure a few other films have been influenced by this piece of film-making down the years; a elder, less contemporary example would be Terrance Malik's 1979 effort 'Badlands'.But this is better than Badlands; it's better than Natural Born Killers and it's better than most other films I've ever seen. Although when a film is the first of its kind, that doesn't mean it's the best of its kind although the statement is true here. Certainly on the scale of first films of a certain type, Bonnie and Clyde holds up against a lot of other films tackling the subject matter now but although films like Jaws and Star Wars were the first blockbusters; I happen to prefer the Indiana Jones films as a whole; likewise there are probably people who love Tarantino without knowing much about the French New Wave of the 1960s so such a statement to say Bonnie and Clyde is better than its imitators is a very recognisable compliment. I feel that Bonnie and Clyde goes against the grain not so much in the way of censorship (even if it to a degree) but to glorification of certain things. There is a scene in the film that does nothing to further the narrative or much else involving various characters Bonnie (Dunaway); Clyde (Beatty); Buck (Hackman) and local gas attendant turned rebel C.W. Moss (Pollard) posing with guns in front of a stolen car. They are having their photo taken individually. Such a scene could be seen as glorification towards guns: guns are 'cool; look what you can do with them and look at how much fun you can have  a topic I'm sure the censors were pulling their hair out over.Michael Moore's 2002 documentary Bowling for Columbine investigated the obsession America has with guns and made a comparison to a load of other countries in terms of gun crime. I don't want to point fingers at films like Bonnie and Clyde for promoting such firearm interest but I feel scenes like this go a long way in setting up fixations. It's worth noting that comeuppance will always come to those in films that deserve it and despite the Hayes code being outdated by a few years when Bonnie and Clyde was made, it would seem that even the filmmakers themselves couldn't bring themselves to create a sort of justified end to the 'villains' of this film. But then again; similarly to most high school shooters, they don't expect to get away and more often than not  kill themselves after their bloody run of violence. Columbine 2002 and Virginia Tech 2007 are good examples.But where Bonnie and Clyde contains politics, it doubly contains narrative, script, characterisation and action. It's worth noting that the film resists having its two leads have sex as well as showing any great deal of violence until its final twenty minutes. Bonnie and Clyde is not a gory film and likewise isn't full of sex yet it was given the 'X' rating here in the UK; probably due to the way it glorified firearms. Early on, Clyde openly tells people he robs cars and banks thus setting up a loose persona about him; Bonnie joins in when she says the same thing. Clyde shoots cans off a wall for fun before teaching Bonnie to shoot a tyre: the interesting thing here is that he's teaching her by telling her to aim at the camera because the tyre is situated a mere few feet in front of us and slightly askew to the left; which creates the illusion she's shooting at us.In terms of narrative, Bonnie and Clyde uses a single line story that takes place in a car, on a road. This is used in a fascinating way as they have to stop off for food a various points; rob banks to keep the cash flow going; steal another car when they need to; Bonnie has time for a revelation with her mother; they bump into a sheriff in an extremely memorable scene and of course, they go through a recruitment process which includes Buck, his wife Blanche and C.W. Moss. Bonnie and Clyde also utilises something else that was very advanced for its time: image. Bonnie and Clyde become celebrities somewhat during the course of the film and this is shown through the newspapers; their names and images even reach as far as obscure backwater camp sites towards the end when, bloody and injured; they meet salvation in the form of gypsies.I feel Bonnie and Clyde deserves all the praise it receives. The film broke away from the field at its time; taking advantage of the mess the censorship rules were in whilst delivering a punch of a film that is fun and entertaining but had brains. The exchanges and emphasis on the 'real' the film has throughout is engaging and interesting and despite any imitators that have been made, this one remains the best.",Bonnie and Clyde
58,filipemanuelneto,"A forgotten classic that helped to build a myth, rather than tell a real story.",7,9 August 2021,"This movie is considered a classic because it is very realistic and violent. It's one of those must-see films for film students, movie buffs or specialized critics. However, it is a film largely forgotten by the general public, and is rarely shown on TV, even on specialty channels.Directed by Arthur Penn, the film addresses the criminal trajectory of Bonnie Elizabeth Parker, a young married woman, and her lover Clyde Chestnut Barrow. In real life, they had a short existence, in the mid-30s, but they roamed a good portion of the Midwest, where they robbed banks, convenience stores, gas stations, etc., totaling more than a hundred robberies and were about twenty people were killed (as the film shows, they avoided gratuitous violence and preferred to avoid confrontations and shootings). The film wastes no time and, in the first few minutes, reveals to us the sudden, even improbable, way in which they both meet and fall in love.However, one of the problems with the film is that it actually continues to create myths around the bad guys, just as the press at the time did. They're charming, they're charismatic, they're almost heroes, and there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with robbing banks in this movie. To make everything even more dubious, the production chose for the protagonists two beautiful actors, who are nothing like the real thugs. Indeed, the film tells a pleasant story, yet it is not historically rigorous, nor does it accurately report what they did.The cast is led by two good actors: the beautiful and blonde Faye Dunaway is very good, charismatic and elegant, and makes in this film one of the works that immortalized her as an actress, and the same can be said of Warren Beatty, who gave life to Clyde, with commitment, professionalism, energy and passion. In fact, the work of the two actors is impeccable, and the way they work together, the intense chemistry that emanates from them when they're together, is something powerful. Do they give us an idealized view of the bad guys? Yes... but they are extremely competent for the task and are doing what they are asked to do. The film also features Michael Pollard, Gene Hackman and Denver Pyle, all of whom are high quality additions, who put a lot of effort into their characters. For me, only Estelle Parsons spoils the scene with her irritating, histrionic character, always screaming, or crying like a repentant Magdalene. I honestly can't understand how the hell she won the Oscar with this movie!Technically, it is a film with several interesting aspects to consider, starting right away with an excellent cinematography, full of realism, without excessive embellishments and exaggerated artifices. The sets are good, they are within what I expected to find; I loved the cars used in the film, and the way the film takes advantage of them. In the same way I also liked the landscapes, which show us an arid and desolate view of the American Midwest, devastated not only by the difficulties of the Great Depression but also by a severe drought, the ""Dust Bowl"". The visuals, specials and sound effects work very well, particularly in the action scenes, and that scene where the shootings destroyed the bandits' car is truly anthological. The only thing I didn't like, although I understand and think it fits well with the film, the way it was thought out and executed, is the soundtrack, with all those banjo solos.",Bonnie and Clyde

Brief Review -If Glorification of Murderers excites you then Bonnie and Clyde is your film. As an audience i personally like to see a biopic of legends, of those people who could inspire me or who has done some great work but then Hollywood brought a biopic of brutal criminals Bonnie and Clyde to break some taboos. There are 2 kind of audience, one who will love it because thier heart might go with the murderers and two who will never care if this was ever made or not. I am gonna fall in the latter group of those who don't care about this film's existence but i liked the cinematic presentation and not the conviction. I had to recall that this film came in the year of socially and culturally important film like 'In The Heat Of The Night' which is my personal favourite too, then why would have i ever cared about Bonnie And Clyde existence? The film tells a story of infamous bank robbers Bonnie and Clyde in brutal and realistic manners. The use of cinematic liberty is less for some unknown reasons or i can guess that they were trying to keep ot lusty and hard-hitting to grab audience's eyes. Faye Dunaway looks damn hot as Bonnie and Warren Beatty carries the swag throughout. But the best performance in the film comes from Estelle Parsons which brought her Oscar. Don't forget to watch out for Oscar winning cinematography. Arthur Penn directs this biographical crime drama with sheer use of violence and it works unless you're not out of your mind over the evil characters of the film. The film might have set trends for the youth audience but glorifying dirty creatures of the society will never be appreciated, at least by me.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest",Bonnie and Clyde
63,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Capturing real-life legends,8,28 June 2012,"Few true stories are the stuff of folk legend, but the tale of Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow ranks near the top. Bank robbers and lovers of the limelight — as well as sometimes each other — their story has everything you could want in a film: suspense, action, humor, drama and romance. ""Bonnie and Clyde"" hits all those notes.The package director Arthur Penn (""The Miracle Worker"") puts together could be a lot neater, but he captures the iconicity of these two tabloid heroes, in large part thanks to stars Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty. They both exemplify the uninhibited joie de vivre of their characters, who seem to fear nothing, go out of their way to give the press something new to write about and speak off hand about when they're caught or killed.Unfortunately, only the beginning of the film, when Bonnie and Clyde meet and head off together, focuses purely on their relationship. During the bulk of the film, the other supporting characters/members of the Barrow Gang have to be pushed to the side for it to be about the titular couple. We know how they feel about each other, but we don't feel permanently strapped in to the roller coaster of their relationship.The inclusion of Buck and Blanche Barrow (Gene Hackman and Estelle Parsons) as well as C.W. Moss (Michael J. Pollard) certainly make ""Bonnie and Clyde"" feel more like an adventure. They bring a certain levity that enhances how care-free they all lived despite constantly having local forces bearing down on them whenever they gave away a small clue of their presence in a certain town.Then there's Blanche, a role that won Parsons an Oscar. Therefore, Blanche is one of the most irritating and unlikable characters (who's not a bad guy) to ever garner an Oscar. She's ""family,"" being Buck's wife, so they must keep her around, though she's self-centered and a complete liability. You wish they'd just throw her out of one of the dozens of cars they steal and drive around in throughout the film, but she sticks around to the audience's chagrin.This large middle chunk of the film featuring the Barrow Gang plays out as a collection of moments from their travels, almost all of which lead to the next time the police will find them, resulting in a gunfight and them fleeing town. These scenes are memorable and build the characters up in entertaining fashion, giving you a sense of just how reckless and fueled by danger they all really were. At the same time, that builds up more of the folk perception of the Barrow Gang rather than capturing who these people were and what drove them to behave that way.Dunaway and Beatty do give us a greater depth of character with their performances when the film allows for a focus on their relationship. We get a very good sense of what attracts each to the other and for Bonnie, a very good idea of what drove her to throw her life away for Clyde Barrow and his anything-but-normal lifestyle. Dunaway embodies everything the script says or suggests about Bonnie Parker. She has a definite beauty and manner suggestive of a woman who knows what power she wields, but there's a naivety to most of her decisions and reactions. Obviously as the film continues she sheds more of the latter for the former.Beatty also demonstrates the dual nature of Clyde, who comes off as so self-assured and in control, yet he harbors some insecurities and is almost team-oriented and selfless to a fault.The one weakness of the script other than limiting the depth with which it explores our main characters is a sense of scope. As to the fame of Bonnie and Clyde and the Barrow Gang's exploits, we are asked to take the film's word for it rather than truly see how they've become a tabloid favorite. We also don't get to see the cat in this cat and mouse relationship between the gang and the authorities. Most films will have part of the story focus on the person/people trying to bring the crooks down, but that person doesn't emerge until very late in the gang. We have trouble understanding what motivates them to take the Barrow Gang down, and so violently too.""Bonnie and Clyde"" also doesn't have much to say, but ultimately, that's okay. It leaves us with is a portrait of who these people were, giving us the opportunity to decide how we feel about them. Was their end tragic? Heart-breaking? A long time coming? Unfair? It's all there for us to pick through, but the unquestionable truth is how fascinating their legend is.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com",Bonnie and Clyde

65,jzappa,The Shadow of Influence,10,29 April 2011,"This wry, irreverent ride was hailed the first modern American film. It came down like a bucket of water. American moviegoers had seen nothing like it before. In feeling and liberty it prevailed from the French New Wave, especially Truffaut's own film about star-crossed sweethearts, Jules and Jim. Actually, Truffaut initially accepted David Newman and Robert Benton's original screenplay---which with director Arthur Penn's support is a stunning success at character psychology through action---and brought it to the scrutiny of Beatty, who was single-minded in producing it.The tale of the production has become virtually as renowned as its heroes. Chronicles are recounted about how Beatty prostrated at the feet of Jack Warner, pleading for the permission to greenlight the film. How Warner saw the original cut and detested it. How the movie was lambasted and Warner Bros. was resolved to abandon it in a chain of Texas drive-ins, and how Beatty begged the studio to take a chance. How it opened and rapidly closed in fall 1967, berated by the critics, getting but one overjoyed opening-day newspaper notice. 1967's quirky, visceral crime spree wouldn't disappear. The bluegrass soundtrack shot to the top of the billboards. Critics notably retracted their initial damaging reviews. The movie re-released, went on to become one of Warner Bros.' biggest hits and won 10 nominations. Ha! There are more ways than just the standard ones you're used to in which a story can be effectively filmed and be gratifying! Movies are not a technical high school! Ha! But less valuable was the effect it had on the American film business. Beatty's readiness to play a brutal character with sexual dysfunction was rare for an established 1960s male lead. Actually, Beatty and Penn cast the movie generally with unfamiliar stage actors, so effectively that all the major players became stars due to this film. Behind the camera, the movie catapulted the careers the entire production crew. And Guffey's cinematography catapulted an entire new wave of its own, of films shot and edited in the more impressionistic French style.Penn came garden-crisp to the project after a booming letdown also made with Beatty. Robert Benton became a significant director. It's like this one film sent all those careers gushing through to the present. It was a film in which all of the dubious pieces convened at the appointed hour.But more than anything, it was a tour de force of tone, in which the actors and filmmakers were all on the same wavelength as they shifted the material from side to side between comedy and tragedy. The opening scenes are flippant, beginning with Clyde's audacity after Bonnie catches him attempting to pinch her mother's car. She intuits in him immediately the agency of her getaway from a tedious Depression-era Texas town. What he basically gives her, for the adorable, idolizing wheelman C.W. Moss and for the eager newspaper readers is the prospect of thrill in lives of monotonous hardship. Clyde announces them at the commencement of a bank heist so they'll be certain to receive acknowledgment. Gene Wilder is as hilarious in his bit role here as in his whole riotous performance in The Producers. And one of the movie's great moments comes as Clyde offers his gun to an evicted black sharecropper so he can put a bullet through a bank's foreclosure sign.If Clyde provides fascination, what with all the symbolic overcompensating by guns and rampaging cars, Bonnie provides hype. She writes The Ballad of Bonnie and Clyde and sends it to a newspaper, and she models for photos sporting a pistol and a cigar. Clyde's brother Buck is less clouded by compensating for sexual inadequacy and more interested in bank jobs than tabloid headings. He comes fastened to Blanche, whose shrill protests aggravate Bonnie, and us. When agents besiege one of their hideaway, she runs earsplitting across the lawn, still holding the spatula she was using to cook. Gene Hackman's Buck Barrow is a jolly, simple, big-hearted man, a little flabby, prone to noisy jokes, knee-slapping and broad reactions. When we first see him, there's a lull in the conversation, as if they've said everything already. It's too much for Buck, who abruptly claps his hands together and spouts out spiritedly.Penn helms the film as a succession of set pieces, which linger in the memory, concentrated and unmistakable. The Okie camp where destitute farmers, tractored off their land by the banks, huddle over campfires. Bonnie's gloomy, dull, bewildered family reunion. The heist that goes awry when C.W. unthinkingly parks the car. The way amusement twirls blindingly into brutality, as when a robbery concludes with a meat cleaver and a bag of flour, or a bungled escape with a bullet in a bank man's face. The confrontation with a state trooper who's made to sit for the gang's photos, and then foolishly freed. The scene where C.W., a gas station helper, impulsively flees with the couple. The scene where C.W.'s father easily badgers him for getting a tattoo. And then the slow-motion formalized dance of the ultimate massacre.The movie ends in a volley of bullets that eternally revolutionized the way the movies portray violence. But the entire film offered a pattern that would be used frequently in subsequent films. It created a genre as well as a cinema movement. Nowadays, the innovation of Bonnie and Clyde has been immersed in innumerable other films, and it's difficult to see how novel and unique it must've felt in 1967, similar to how the 1941 shock of Citizen Kane might not be palpable to those reared in the dusk of its impact.",Bonnie and Clyde
66,GOWBTW,An Original in its right,10,6 June 2017,"Everyone knows the story of the famous Robin Hoods of the 20th century. Yet, there are conflicting records of how these individuals were perceived. ""Bonnie & Clyde"" are the well-known couple who are perceived as ""heroes"" to the public, and ""villains"" to law-enforcement. Their backgrounds are spotty. Bonnie(Faye Dunaway) was working as a waitress in Texas. Clyde(Warren Beatty) has already racked up a rap sheet with robbery. When these two met, it wasn't quite love at first sight. Personal inconsistencies showed between the two. From stealing cars, to robbing banks, these two made themselves a household name. It's the 1930's. The Great Depression was in effect. People were losing their homes to the banks. The solution: The Bonnie & Clyde gang. In the South, they go to the big banks to rob, because the small banks have gone bust. They outrun the law. They fought the law. They go down in a blaze of glory. They should be doing life without parole. But the law has turned them into martyrs. The actors are great. The story line was fine. Even though it was fictionalized, it was worth the watch. A must have for your library. 5 stars.",Bonnie and Clyde

68,jadavix,New Hollywood starts with a bang,9,22 February 2016,"Almost 50 years later it is still easy to see how Bonnie and Clyde kickstarted the whole New Hollywood trend, and also why so many critics were up in arms about it, with one notable exception (Roger Ebert, RIP.)The movie is as raw and forceful as a bullet through the eyeball fired by a man to whom your head is just target practice. It is still shockingly violent, as the violence is treated as a simple fact of life; particularly some lives more than others.New Hollywood showed life as it was. Sex, drugs, violence, if it was there, they showed it. And they did not glorify it nor the people who did it. Clyde Barrow may be charming, but he is a psychopath. Coming back to this movie after so many years, what struck me (aside from the sequence where the guy hanging onto the car has his brains blown out) is the fact that none of the people Bonnie and Clyde meet are all that shocked or perturbed by who they are or what they do. They are seen as heroes, if not by the filmmakers who wouldn't offer such an easy reduction, by the average folk who were also downtrodden by society but didn't have the ""gumption"" to take matters into their own hands as did B & C.This adds a nihilistic, lawless feel to the whole movie. Nowadays filmmakers would feel obligated to provide a moral centre, a character who appears smarter than the others resoundingly criticising and making it plain that they are doing wrong. Bonnie and Clyde offers no such thing.It is also a jolt of adrenalin from beginning to end. The editing is fantastic, providing hardly any let up of the action throughout the movie's runtime.",Bonnie and Clyde

Yes. In one way, I would.If nothing else - I certainly did enjoy this 1967 ""bang-bang-shoot-em-up"" picture mainly for its vintage, early-1930's automobiles. As well - I sure did appreciate the attention to detail that was paid to the period setting of the story.Set in the American Mid-West during the Great Depression, this film definitely did deliver a satisfying slice of cinematic nostalgia when it came to the depiction of that particular era in US history.All-in-all - I'd say that it was this picture's first-rate camera-work, by Burnett Guffey, that kept this somewhat dimwitted tale about publicity-seeking outlaws (turned folk heroes) from going completely off the rails.And, of course. for his exceptional camera-work in this picture Guffey won a very well-deserved Oscar for ""Cinematography"".",Bonnie and Clyde
70,ackstasis,"""We rob banks""",8,12 May 2009,"In 1967, two films ushered in a new wave of Hollywood film. Mike Nichol's 'The Graduate (1967)' introduced casual sexuality into the mix, with young graduate Dustin Hoffman enjoying a tryst with Anne Bancroft's Mrs. Robinson, highlighting the vast generation gap between the Baby Boomers and their parents. Arthur Penn's 'Bonnie and Clyde (1967),' likewise, pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable to show in film, featuring glorious set-pieces of violence that would influence the later work of Sam Peckinpah and Martin Scorsese. This new brand of authentic yet stylised brutality may have been borrowed from Spaghetti Western director Sergio Leone, whose own ""Dollars"" trilogy had proved successful with American audiences {his Hollywood-funded follow-up, 'Once Upon a Time in the West (1968),' was a magnificent film, but noticeably toned down the violence}. Many reviewers were initially indifferent to Penn's picture, and Warner Brothers had little faith in its financial prospects, but the support of critics like Pauline Kael prompted a swift reevaluation, and 'Bonnie and Clyde' was soon a box-office hit.Despite being set in the 1930s, and, of course, based on true events, Penn's retelling of the Bonnie and Clyde story overtly reflected the revolutionary cultural times in which the film was made. The two titular fugitives symbolised the attitudes of the young people of the day – brash, impudent, dismissive of authority, and indifferent as to the consequences of their actions. Intriguingly, 'Bonnie and Clyde' appears to suggest that something more than mere anarchistic tendencies fuelled the pair's violent escapades. Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty) is portrayed as sexually impotent, and a lengthy, uncomfortable would-be sex scene emphasises the self-loathing frustration that, perhaps, fuelled his personal inadequacy and prompted him to seek other, more destructive means of alleviating his stress and exhibiting his masculinity. Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway) is depicted as a young woman whose sexual repression at the hands of a well-meaning but morally-uptight mother has stifled her femininity, and only through societal rebellion does she appear to regain her sense of identity. This theme ties in nicely with the Women's Liberation of the 1960s.Beatty and Dunaway are perfect in the two leading roles, displaying enough charisma and sex appeal to come across as likable, but also inspiring sympathy and disapproval for their clearly irresponsible and reprehensible behaviour (the film initially provoked controversy for its perceived ""glorification"" of criminals, but, though the audience's empathy is recruited to some extent, the destructive and inevitable consequences of the gang's actions are hardly glossed over). The famous, gruesome climax – in which Bonnie and Clyde are apathetically gunned down in a bloody police ambush – was perhaps the most intense minute of cinema American audiences had ever experienced. Of course, once the floodgates were opened, New Hollywood began to adopt his fresh, powerful frankness in its storytelling. Sam Peckinpah, no doubt inspired by Penn's efforts, decisively raised the bar with his Revisionist Western 'The Wild Bunch (1969).' A landmark American film, 'Bonnie and Clyde' furthered the reputations of both its director and star Warren Beatty, and successfully launched the acting careers of Faye Dunaway, Gene Hackman and Gene Wilder.",Bonnie and Clyde
71,dee.reid,"""Bonnie and Clyde"" - The '60's answer to the waning days of innocence",10,4 April 2005,"""Bonnie and Clyde,"" released in 1967, is one of the best movies of the 20th century, and perhaps one of the greatest movies of all time. Directed by Arthur Penn, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway star in a romanticized account of the real-life pair of bank-robbing outlaw lovers Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, who set off a reign of terror throughout the American Midwest during the 1930s. The Depression was still fresh on everyone's mind and Bonnie and Clyde new that, finding out the hard way the toll it was taking on Americans as it did prove to be a hassle for them when they robbed banks. I thought it was especially generous that Clyde decides to let a farmer keep his money while they rob one bank, and then a montage following the scene shows the people who witnessed it as being happy and whimsical and proud that they were in a bank that was stuck up by the Barrow Gang. Beatty and Dunaway are fantastic and convincing as the doomed lovers on the run, as are the film's supporting players including Gene Hackman, Estelle Parsons, and Michael J. Pollard. The film's violence is also pretty effective too, being that when people get shot, they bleed - profusely, realistically - and ""Bonnie and Clyde"" also helped to lay out the groundwork for Sam Peckinpah's ""The Wild Bunch"" two years down the road in 1969. And everyone knows about the film's ending, which is one of the bloodiest death scenes ever filmed, and how a storm of bullets ushered both Bonnie and Clyde into American and cinematic history, and the poem Bonnie Parker sent to the newspaper that eerily foreshadowed their brutal demise. Of course, by this time we've come to really sympathize with the two outlaws, and this is what makes their deaths all the more shocking. A true historic and cinematic landmark masterpiece; ""Bonnie and Clyde"" is timeless.10/10",Bonnie and Clyde

73,st-shot,An American Classic,9,28 February 2008,"Bonnie and Clyde is one of the most important films in the history of American film. It ushered in Hollywood's last golden age with it's audacious style and storyline and re-energized an industry that was content to play it safe with non-offensive Rock Hudson, Doris Day romantic comedies and Elvis vehicles. The timing could not have been better. It was the era of dissent and upheaval in this country and Bonnie and Clyde were ideal anti-establishment romantic symbols for the times as well as fashion trend setters.Set in Depression era Texas and Oklahoma the film follows the bloody career of the Barrow gang from its first grocery store heist to their spectacularly violent end. Newly released inmate Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty) crosses paths with the sexually frustrated Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway) when she catches him trying to steal her mother's car. Bored with her small town existence she runs off with Clyde who offers her a world of excitement except between the sheets. CW Moss (Michael J Pollard) his brother Buck (Gene Hackman) and Buck's reluctant wife (Estelle Parsons) round out the gang as they blaze a path across the territory. In the early stages there's a comic, slapstick humor to their escapades but things turn ugly quickly with the murder of a bank employee.Bonnie and Clyde succeeds on nearly every level. Director Arthur Penn mixes humor and violence in a disturbing fashion that keeps the viewer off balance and engrossed. The entire gang gives Oscar nominated performances, each one clearly defining their characters, holding their own in every scene. Additionally Denver Pyle, Dub Taylor and Gene Wilder all chip in solid support to round out what amounts to perfect casting.Master B&W cinematographer Burnett Guffey visuals capture the bleak 30's setting in a painterly fashion with muted tonal landscapes of country roads, corn fields and small southwestern towns. Beautifully partnering with these visuals is the bluegrass music score provided by Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs.The editing's nouvelle vague application has a jolting vitality that heightens suspense and conveys the mass chaos of shoot outs and escapes in a style that puts you in the getaway car. It's bloody, it's violent, it's exciting and therein lies the film's only drawback. Penn goes to great lengths to romanticize the murderous exploits of this real life duo, portraying them as modern day Robin Hoods pitted against the mean spirited banks that foreclose farms. The film's only villainous character is Sheriff Frank Hammer replete with Simon Legree mustache who brings the pair to justice. The violence is graphic and it's balance with the film's humor can be disconcerting but it is part of the daring that Penn and crew injects into a film that dares to be different and ends up daring to be great.",Bonnie and Clyde
74,robfollower,A paradigm-shifting classic of American cinema,9,9 February 2019,"Producer/star Warren Beatty had to convince Warner Bros. to finance this film, which went on to become the studio's second-highest grosser. It also caused major controversy by redefining violence in cinema and casting its criminal protagonists as sympathetic anti-heroes. Based loosely on the true exploits of Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker during the 30s, the film begins as Clyde (Beatty) tries to steal the car of Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway)'s mother. Bonnie is excited by Clyde's outlaw demeanor, and he further stimulates her by robbing a store in her presence. Clyde steals a car, with Bonnie in tow, and their legendary crime spree begins. The two move from town to town, pulling off small heists, until they join up with Clyde's brother Buck (Gene Hackman), his shrill wife Blanche (Estelle Parsons), and a slow-witted gas station attendant named C.W. Moss (Michael J. Pollard). The new gang robs a bank and Clyde is soon painted in the press as a Depression-era Robin Hood when he allows one bank customer to hold onto his money. Soon the police are on the gang's trail and they are constantly on the run, even kidnapping a Texas Ranger (Denver Pyle) and setting him adrift on a raft, handcuffed, after he spits in Bonnie's face when she kisses him. That same ranger leads a later raid on the gang that leaves Buck dying, Blanche captured, and both Clyde and Bonnie injured. The ever-loyal C.W. takes them to his father's house. C.W.'s father disaproves his son's affiliation with gangsters and enters a plea bargain with the Texas Rangers. A trap is set that ends in one of the bloodiest death scenes in cinematic history. The film made stars out of Beatty and Dunaway, and it also featured the screen debut of Gene Wilder as a mortician briefly captured by the gang. Its portrayal of Bonnie and Clyde as rebels who empathized with the poor working folks of the 1930s struck a chord with the counterculture of the 1960s and helped generate a new, young audience for American movies that carried over into Hollywood's renewal of the 1970s. Its combination of sex and violence with dynamic stars, social relevance, a traditional Hollywood genre, and an appeal to hip young audiences set the pace for many American movies to come.",Bonnie and Clyde
75,jimbo-53-186511,A big disappointment (considering all the hype),2,27 June 2015,"This film gives an account of the real life bank robbing couple Bonnie and Clyde (portrayed by Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty respectively). In the beginning it's just Bonnie and Clyde committing said crimes, but they soon recruit mechanic C.W Moss (Michael J Pollard)and Clyde's brother Buck (Gene Hackman) and his unwilling wife Blanche (Estelle Parsons).I know there are a lot of people who criticise biographical films for not providing a 'true' account of the event. I myself will not normally complain about these things as long as the biopic is either entertaining, informative, interesting or moving (or all four in an ideal world). The problem with this cinematic version of Bonnie and Clyde is that it does none of these things.....The writers give us some background information at the very start of the film, but somehow just seem content with that and don't offer any other insight throughout the remainder of the running time. Neither Bonnie nor Clyde were developed sufficiently and neither were any of their gang members. In fact, by the end of the film I felt like I barely knew any of them. It's almost like the writers made this film exclusively for people who knew the story already or perhaps they just didn't care about their audience. This laziness is evident at the end when we're given no explanation of the 'aftermath' which just shows how poor the writing was in this film.I also found the story very repetitive and boring; the staging of the robberies were dull and unexciting. I also didn't like the way that the writers turned this into some kind of soap opera - Bonnie and Blanche's squabbles and all the petty arguments just wound me up. If there had been some character development here then I might have cared a bit more, but because their characters weren't developed it did feel a bit like watching a cheap soap opera at times. The picture was also noisy and chaotic and sometimes it became irritating and embarrassing.Another thing that annoyed me about this film was Warren Beatty himself; he must have spent about 80% of the film wandering round with that big stupid smile on his face (when he puts his full smile on he looks like The Joker) and on other occasions he smirks and grimaces his way through the film as though he's suffering from bad wind. Look folks I know that's probably just me, but Beatty's performance did make me cringe.Thank goodness then for Hackman who is always watchable and was great in his respective role. Beatty's counterpart Dunaway was also pretty good and was far better than Beatty himself.To be honest I would have been disappointed with this film if it was an average film with an average IMDb score, but the fact that this film is an Oscar Winning Crime Drama and given the fact that it has an IMDb score of 7.9 makes me mildly angry. I spent 105 minutes watching an empty film that seemed to offer no real insight into the notorious outlaws and worse still the writers didn't even have the decency to make it entertaining, interesting, informative or exciting. It's probably one of the worst crime films I've seen.SIDE NOTE; there is a continuity error about halfway through the film - when the gang emerge from the field in their car the left hand headlight is seen dangling above the bumper, but in the next scene it's mounted in its correct position again. Tut Tut to the Continuity Editor. Sadly, for me, that was the most interesting thing about this whole film.",Bonnie and Clyde
76,Nazi_Fighter_David,A masterpiece that dares to be excessive!,9,8 February 2009,"'Bonnie and Clyde' is not a film about two real people famous for so many bank robberies and murders across the big country... It shows a new kind of fury in which people could be harm by weapons... The film, however, manages to carry the impression that these two youngsters took great pleasure in robbing banks and stores... It also suggests that it was very easy for them to fool the lawas certainly occurred in real life... Though merited punishment caught up with them, audiences laughed at their remarkable deeds and wanted them to get away...In 'Bonnie and Clyde,' Penn created an emotional state, an image of the 1930s filtered through his 1960s sensibility... The sense of this period reflects Penn's vision of how the 1930s Depression-era truly was, and for all the crazy style and banjo score, this vision is greatly private...What is also personal about 'Bonnie and Clyde' and constitutes its incomparable quality, is its unusual mixture of humor and fear, its poetry of violation of the law as something that is gaiety and playfulness...'Bonnie and Clyde' is both true and abstract... It is a gangster movie and a comedy-romance... It is an amusing film that turns bloody, a love affair that ends with tragedy...A modification between pleasure and catastrophic events is important to the essential aim of the film... In their second bank robbery, a daring and joyful action goes morosely embittered when Clyde is forced to kill an executive in the bank, and real blood pours out from his body...Bonnie and Clyde take self-gratification posing for photographs with their prisoners But when surrounded by detectives in a motel, they turn into vindictive bandits struggling for their lives... C. W. Moss, specially, brings to mind Baby Face Nelson, when he murders policemen with a blazing machine gun...One of the stimulating moments in the film happens when Clyde chases Bonnie through a yellow corn field, while a cloud transverses the sun and slowly shadows the landscape... Here the characteristic quality of the Texas countryside and the vague aspect of the story are beautifully communicated......Penn's masterpiece nominated for ten Academy Awards, including Best Picture, won two Oscars, one for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and another for Best Cinematography...",Bonnie and Clyde
77,barnabyrudge,"Hugely influential, important and well-made crime odyssey - a genuine American classic.",10,15 February 2013,"""We rob banks"" – armed with this simple motto, Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty star as two of cinema's most iconic characters in this classic crime drama. Blending sudden shocking violence with quirkily amusing vignettes, Bonnie And Clyde is a film which constantly defies expectations its offbeat narrative is endlessly engaging, its characterisation wonderfully rich, its eye for detail in the stark Depression-era dustbowl setting simply perfect. Pushing thematic boundaries to new limits, the film is one of the first Hollywood movies to dwell on bloodily realistic injuries and sexual ambiguity – we see flesh torn apart by bullets, we watch characters writhe in pain, we are awkward witnesses to Clyde's frequent bouts of impotence which prevent him from sexually fulfilling his partner in crime (who also happens to be his partner between the sheets). There is almost a hint of the European New Wave about the style of the film, but its story is pure Americana – an exuberant celebration of Depression-era folklore, charting the exploits of two criminals in a disarming way which makes us end up rooting for them in spite of their considerable misdemeanours. The combination of European-style frankness and American myth prove a perfect mix the film was a huge hit with audiences at the time.Frustrated waitress Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway) catches ex-con Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty) attempting to steal her mother's car. Clyde manages to talk his way out of the situation with his usual roguish charm, and soon he and Bonnie find themselves acting like old friends although they've just met. Clyde admits to Bonnie that he has served time for armed robbery. For a bored thrill-seeker like Bonnie, news like this is like putting a spark to a firework. She is desperate for adventure; he is desperate to impress it doesn't take long for the pair to embark on a crime spree across the American west, holding up stores, gas stations and banks as they go. There's no great plan behind their actions, no grand crusade just a couple of happy-go-lucky robbers doing what they do for the sheer thrill of it. Soon, they are joined in their cross-country odyssey by Clyde's brother Buck (Gene Hackman) and his overbearing wife Blanche (Estelle Parsons), plus aimless youth C.W. Moss (Michael J. Pollard). What started out as a wild adventure fast becomes something far more deadly – Bonnie, Clyde and the gang begin leaving corpses in their wake; their reputation precedes them. They are soon wanted. Dead or alive. There can be no happy ending for them after the life they've chosen to lead.The film is enthralling from first moment to last. The actors give exceptional performances across the board, earning five Oscar nominations, one of which (Estelle Parsons) went on to win the award. All the leads are terrifically convincing in their respective roles, managing that rare feat of making us forget we are watching performances. When acting feels so authentic that you don't realise it's acting at all, you know you're watching something special. Burnett Guffey also received an Oscar for his tremendous cinematography, capturing the tinder-dry expanses of the dustbowl majestically - Bonnie And Clyde is a beautiful-looking film throughout. It really is hard to emphasise how important a movie Bonnie And Clyde is in the grand scheme of things. It marks a major evolutionary step in the Hollywood system, a sudden moment of enlightenment when American cinema took a leap of faith in a brave new direction.",Bonnie and Clyde
78,drystyx,"not much to like, but neither were Bonnie and Clyde",2,13 May 2007,"It's hard to say this is a romanticized version of the life of killers so crazed that even other outlaws thought they were geeks. True, Beatty was handsome and Dunaway wasn't exactly ugly, but the glamour ended there. The movie starts with the pair hooking up just out of the blue, and nonchalantly going on a crime spree, much as the characters from a later film, BADLANDS. There is no charisma or chemistry a viewer can discern. The director obviously realized this, and had a more interesting character played by a charismatic Michael J Pollard, join up with them. The dialog isn't very interesting. The action is sort of ho hum, and the characters don't make you care one way or the other. Nothing is really explained. One gets the sense that the director wanted to endear his two lead characters, but if he did, he failed miserably. There just isn't a lot to like. Maybe there isn't anything to like.",Bonnie and Clyde
79,EUyeshima,They Still Rob Banks in a Terrifically Packaged 40th Anniversary Special Edition DVD Set,9,25 March 2008,"Those of you who have been fortunate enough to read Mark Harris' recently published ""Pictures at a Revolution: Five Movies and the Birth of New Hollywood"" know his illuminating account of the long, checkered road that led to the production and release of this seminal 1967 movie. Produced by Warren Beatty, it initially bombed but then was championed by influential critic Pauline Kael to secure a re-release. The groundbreaking film took off and became a flash point for censors to usher in the modern ratings system still in effect today. Looking at the film in a freshly restored print on the 2008 Special Edition DVD, it strikes me now as an exceptionally well-crafted combination of revisionist history and contemporary humor laced abruptly with spurts of unrelenting violence. Although the story is based on real-life figures, the film feels far less like a biopic and more like a romantic tragedy. Beatty was responsible for crucial aspects of the production, but director Arthur Penn and screenwriters David Newman and Robert Benton deserve significant credit for the final, often mesmerizing result.The plot reads like a folktale. Set during the depth of the Great Depression in 1931 Texas, frustrated diner waitress Bonnie Parker catches a small-time ex-con named Clyde Barrow stealing her mother's car. Instead of reporting him to the police, she gets excited by his adventurous spirit and dares him to rob a grocery store. That becomes the point of no return as they begin a whirlwind trip from Texas to Missouri robbing banks. Along the way, they form the Barrow Gang with slow-witted gas-pump jockey C.W. Moss as their getaway driver along with Clyde's quick-tempered brother Buck and his panic-stricken wife Blanche. They become local heroes to the downtrodden townsfolk and farmers already facing bank foreclosures and unemployment. However, their fate appears predetermined in increasingly foreboding episodes, especially with a Texas Ranger they humiliate and a comically bewildering ride with undertaker Eugene Grizzard and his wife. The ending is such a classic that it has lost some of its shock value, but it is an appropriate exclamation point to the infamy of the title characters.As Clyde, Beatty gets to play up his strengths as a moody, charismatic actor and makes clear the character's impotence as an intriguing subtext to his innately violent nature. In a role passed over by Natalie Wood, Jane Fonda and Tuesday Weld, Faye Dunaway makes a remarkably vivid impression as Bonnie even if her character is not nearly as complex as Clyde. A tad too glamorous for the role, she still makes palpable Bonnie's small-town frustration and need for intimacy. Like Dunaway, Gene Hackman broke out of anonymity with his searing performance as Buck. Michael J. Pollard is memorable as C.W., as are Estelle Parsons (long before playing Roseanne's lesbian mother) as Blanche and Gene Wilder, also in his film debut, as Eugene. The technical work is outstanding, in particular, Burnett Guffey's textured cinematography and Dede Allen's quickly paced editing, both of which come together masterfully in the violent climax. Any of these elements, if not coordinated correctly, could have led the film awry, but they don't and the film remains an incisive study of two desperate characters during an equally desperate time.The two-disc 2008 Special Edition DVD is loaded with extras. Disc One contains the restored movie and a couple of the theatrical trailers. Disc Two contains a fascinating 40th anniversary documentary, ""Revolution: The Making of 'Bonnie and Clyde'"", hosted by Beatty and running just over an hour. Much like Harris' book, it covers almost everything you'd want to know about the film, including its genesis from Francois Truffaut whose French New Wave influence can still be felt in the final film. Moreover, it really shows how enterprising Beatty was in getting his first big-screen production off the ground despite a lot of studio opposition. The second documentary is a standard History Channel program, ""Love and Death: The Story of Bonnie and Clyde"", covering the considerably less glamorous real-life details of the original outlaws. In terms of archival footage, there is also a longish segment of Beatty's wardrobe tests; and two deleted scenes, both without sound, that last about five minutes. For an additional cost, there is also available the Bonnie and Clyde Ultimate Collector's Edition for die-hard fans. It includes all the extras of the Special Edition plus a 36-page hardcover book of behind-the-scenes photos, a 24-page reproduction of the original 1967 press book, and a mail-in poster offer.",Bonnie and Clyde
80,I_Ailurophile,"Classic, unglamorous portrait",10,7 June 2021,"'Bonnie and Clyde' is rightly held as a cinema classic, as much a cornerstone of American culture as the nigh-mythical duo that inspired it. Like the criminal couple, the legend of the picture is almost larger in reputation than in reality - but that doesn't make this any less exciting.The film rapidly builds characterizations of Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow that are more unexpectedly rough and tumultuous than their fame suggests. Beautiful and alluring as Faye Dunaway is, Bonnie is depicted as impulsive and a bit demanding in her thrill-seeking. Warren Beatty, as Clyde, is a smooth talker, but carries a certain cruelty with him. And the both of them demonstrate a weakness of personal skills that matches their less than practiced criminality.Echoing the complexity of the characters specifically, the course of events seen on film isn't all merry myth-making and flawless felonious fun. Well before the violence begins escalating, there's a significant clash between strong personalities within the Barrow gang, and no small pondering of where their lives are headed. And once the blood starts flowing - even by today's much more visceral standards, it's unquestionably shocking, and the ending unflinchingly brutal.I find myself surprised watching this. Bonnie and Clyde are upheld as antiheroes in the public consciousness, and this movie does, too. But rather than the undue lionization so often afforded to highly visible figures, the movie further paints a picture that's very well-rounded, and therefore rocky, and a little unflattering. This isn't entirely the feature I anticipated - it's better.The production standards clearly marks this as dating to the 1960s, as does the way that the film leaps somewhat haphazardly into introducing the characters, and kickstarting the narrative. No one is going to mistake this for a movie of the 90s, let alone 00s or 10s, where screenplays have a broad tendency to slowly inform of their characters. Regardless of these differences, 'Bonnie and Clyde' still very much holds up, more than 50 years later.It's duly captivating, and thrilling, and Dunaway and Beatty are a fetching pair of leads. 'Bonnie and Clyde' remains a cinema classic well worth revisiting, or even still, watching for the first time.",Bonnie and Clyde

You can't help but see the ambush at the end as a reference to the Vietnam War. Clyde losing one of his lenses show his blindness by ambush. It also takes more than 1 bullet to kill a legend. They were a threat to society....the old society. The entire film stands on a very casual narrative structure.

83,p-stepien,Destitute love story...,7,2 November 2012,"A classic for the ages featuring Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway as the legendary criminal lovers Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, serial robbers and cop killers, who rose to prominence in the midst of the Great Depression. Vilified by the system they became Robin Hood figures amongst the destitution of the collapsing economy, where out of frustration banks became evil objectified and the bloody capers of the immortal duo a personification of social justice.Arthur Penn manages to thread out a story, where he steers away from an iconification of the gruesome lovers, but also never attempts to vilify or judge. Shown as a misguided dropout of systemic failure, Bonnie and Clyde are an immoral amalgamate, but one none less depraved then the society and system in which they function. Times calling for desperate measures crime becomes their shot at fame. The non-judgemental approach serves well in the overall story, which is fairly close to true events, the biggest changes stem from minimising the size of the accompanying Barrow gang to a few faithfuls, whilst in fact they created a pretty vast crime cell. Neither criminal geniuses nor inherently evil, but merely morally inept with a widely self-serving agenda, the famous pair are believably portrayed, not in ways pretentiously trying to iconize them (although this actually contradicts the real-life impact the movie had on pop culture).Still powerful as a period piece Arthur Penn's anti-epic remains lively and relevant, with both Dunaway and Beatty dominating screen time with one of the best duos in movie history. Nonetheless ""Bonnie and Clyde"" does tend to drag out making the meticulously built dramaturgy falter and clog down interest. Only after the family reunion does Penn get back into gear swiftly and forcefully homing in on the inevitable finale.",Bonnie and Clyde
84,alexanderdavies-99382,One of the first of its kind!,10,23 June 2017,"""Bonnie and Clyde"" is a film that dared to be different. It's violence, direction and acting were the blueprint for the kind of Hollywood movies that came onto the scene in the early 1970s. Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway compliment each other to perfection as the bank robbers in question. Gene Hackman made a huge impact in his first major movie and his performance doesn't disappoint at all. Arthur Penn's direction is smooth and assured. I remember feeling quite shocked by the excessive violence when I saw ""Bonnie and Clyde"" at the age of 3. I never would have guessed that this film was made in 1967, it is years ahead of its time. There is some good humour and Gene Wilder is a riot as one of the hostages! As much as the gang of outlaws are criminals, they aren't totally unlikeable as people. With regards to everyone day folk, Bonnie and Company are quite reasonable toward them. This is where tough, gritty Hollywood movie- making begins.",Bonnie and Clyde

You made me somebody they're gonna remember.""Well, what an entertaining ride this was! This semi-true look at the notorious activities of Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow started well and never slowed down or dipped in quality for a second. It was funny, action-packed, and has an euphoric sense of excitement that many older movies don't aim for. The story started with Bonnie & Clyde's first meeting, and continued on during the many Depression-era robberies they became famous for, to their deaths. It's pretty well-known that the duo died young, but by the finale of the movie you'll have become so attached to these characters that their end will still feel like a blow. Dunaway and Beatty are excellent as the two main characters, and the supporting cast also doesn't disappoint.From the dialogue to the camera angles to the pacing, Bonnie & Clyde seems designed to hold your attention like a vice until the very end. It's a very modern-feeling movie, and one that any classic or contemporary movie fan shouldn't hesitate to check out. Recommended.",Bonnie and Clyde
86,winner55,"the ""true story"" will never be known",9,4 May 2007,"Time does strange things to a movie.When I saw this film in 1981, not having seen it for five years, I was surprised at what borderline sociopaths Bonnie and Clyde really are. It was always in evidence, as when Clyde tells Bonnie's mother about not robbing a bank for fear of getting Bonnie hurt; or when Bonnie decides to enjoy the Busby Berkley musical shortly after witnessing a man shot in the face. So why hadn't I seen this before? The truth is, this film does not romanticize these criminals - its AUDIENCE does. That is the real key to this film's success over the course of now forty years. The audience wants this couple to be ""young and in love and (to) kill people."" The film thus quietly reproduces the cultural phenomenon it is really about - the glamorization of Bonnie and Clyde that began almost as soon as they robbed their first bank, back in the thirties.Penn has to be congratulated for achieving this; the question lingers, should he have made this point more obvious? or was he right to let the audience experience this and later figure it out for themselves? Frankly, I don't know.As for the historical truthfulness of the film: This has never been an issue for me, I didn't expect any more historical accuracy from this than I would from a Western. Actually, however, the decision to jettison accuracy right from the start was a good one, in retrospect - in researching the real bandits involved, it soon becomes apparent that the ""true story"" of Bonnie and Clyde will never be known. Bonnie's family lies for her; the surviving Barrow gang members were all liars; Clyde himself was a liar; and the policemen who ambushed them lied about the brutality of the shooting.Sure, the posse admitted they shot the bandits in cold blood; but Bonnie had six pistol wounds close together in her back, going straight in - which means someone walked up to the car with a loaded revolver and emptied it into her at close range. And Clyde was shot mostly from the left, Bonnie from the right - that means the car was surrounded.The coroner's report also states that Bonnie's right hand had been completely mangled by gun shots, leaving him unable to take her fingerprints. That's not true; the posse had taken her fingers for souvenirs (and a couple of Clyde's). The coroner knew this well enough - he was the one who insisted that the souvenir hounds be brought under control by Texas Ranger Hamer - who had no jurisdiction in Louisiana, by the way.And a later search through criminal records discovered that Bonnie had never been charged with any crime committed while with Clyde, even in absentia via warrant. Technically, ""wanted"" posters not withstanding, she wasn't wanted by any state for any crime at all.In short - they were murdered.I mention these facts, having only recently discovered them on the web, not to defend the bandits. Clyde could be a cold-blooded killer, there's plenty of evidence of that; and Bonnie's fascination for him was decidedly perverse. But the wild thing here is that nobody connected with the real case was truly innocent - except maybe the dead victims of the gang (who were never given a chance to lie). Lie atop lie; crime atop crime. That's truly remarkable; and it is to Penn's credit that his film does not resolve any of these issues. That too is left to the audience.One other note - although Burnett Guffey's cinematography does a marvelous job projecting historical scenes without nostalgia (the 'nostalgia' craze surrounding the film at release was yet another imposition by its audience), the distance of time now reveals that it is generally rather flat and coldly competent, with a couple of important scenes as exceptions. in short, it looks headed toward television; time has not been favorable to the visuals of this film.Yet that too leaves us with the haunting questions concerning historical truth - I though the camera work stunningly beautiful when I was young; now it just looks like so much TV. Was I lying to myself then? or am I now? We want to say, ""time will tell;"" but that's exactly what time does not do.",Bonnie and Clyde

(R)Milestone of American cinema is a brash, vivid and controversial provocation presenting intertwined humor and violence that comment upon one another, both celebrating and criticizing the excess of filmmaking and the audience's response to it, as well as the exploitation of media in making folk hero stars out of criminals. Clyde Barrow (Beatty) and Bonnie Parker (Dunaway) are sold as young lovers on the lam that rob banks, but they're not very good at robbing banks, and they're not very good at loving each other either (killing people, on the other hand...). The two stars are peerless in their matching, and the rest of the Barrow Gang is terrifically performed and realized as well: affable hayseed Hackman, his shrieking wife Parsons, shy and dim Pollard. Penn never made a movie like this before or since, thrillingly alive yet sensationalistically brutal; Burnett Guffey's Oscar-winning photography and Dede Allen's landmark editing techniques work in tandem for a stylish, electric visual presentation. Shattering, blood-soaked climax is still a powerhouse. Parsons also picked up an Academy Award for her work.96/100",Bonnie and Clyde

Along with their gang, Buck Barrow (Gene Hackman), Blanche Barrow (Estelle Parsons) & C.W. Moss (Michael J. Pollard), they engage in an extended crime spree while desperately trying to stay one step ahead of the law.The acting is well-handled with all of the above-mentioned individuals garnering Oscar nominations (Parsons actually ended up winning). Personally, I think that Dunaway gave the best performance but I don't think that any of the actors were singled out undeservedly.Arthur Penn's direction is well-executed and the film managed to win an Oscar for its cinematography (probably due to the dream-like photography of the reunion with Bonnie's family). Also worth noting is the film's soundtrack, which makes memorable use of the bluegrass stylings of Flatt and Scruggs.My initial opinion of the film was that its reputation must be built upon influence rather than technical merit or entertainment value. Actually, I still think that that may be true to certain degree, but now I feel that the film is a commendable one even when taken out of historical context. Therefore, I wholeheartedly recommend it (assuming that you don't mind liberal deviation from the facts surrounding the real Bonnie & Clyde).",Bonnie and Clyde
90,Howlin Wolf,Perhaps the greatest tale of 'manipulation' ever told...,10,20 July 2005,"Before I begin this review in earnest; I'd just like to quickly pass comment on IMDb's plot summary for this film, which states that the spree of Bonnie and Clyde is 'romanticised' in its telling on film. I just don't think this is true. Certainly, it's possible that the 'myth' we see may not tally all that well with the actual *reality* of events; but to argue that the film downplays the 'shocking' nature of their crimes is ludicrous, I feel. The abolition of the 'Hayes Code' wasn't instigated for nothing at around this time...Now, onto the issues of the film proper. ""Bonnie and Clyde"" has all the staple elements you'd expect of a crime picture (gunfights, the exploration of the open road, etc... ) but I feel by far it's most interesting element is examined fully in its early stages - the psychological subtleties of ego and dependency.We see from the start that these fugitives who eventually grow into a self-styled 'gang' aren't exactly the criminal masterminds they kid themselves to be in fantasy. They are definitely the underclass of a downtrodden society. However, it's clear that Clyde Barrow possesses the most devious sense of intelligence in the bunch. His experience of life on the wrong side of the law before he encounters Bonnie tells him that this poor naive girl will be easy to enthral with his outsized tales of derring-do; and he understands that he can go further with an accomplice than he could just scratching out an existence on his own. What else does he want in her other than a tailor-made admirer, for we find out that his libido is a cloudy issue of his life... Since the escapades of the duo were brought to an end; we've learnt of further unpleasant cases in criminal history where the impressionable girl has turned sour by being taken under the wing of a morally-compromised man... He tells her she's too 'smart' to be wasting her time in a backwater when she could be making something of herself and in the thick of the action; but then when their mistakes begin to catch up with them, suddenly it is the female who bears the brunt of male frustration... By this time she's usually too deluded by her love to recognise the dependant relationship that has formed, and break free... Dunaway captures the dichotomy of spunky girl whose attitude betrays that she's desperate to be valued, perfectly.Beatty, as Barrow, is not left without his own case of vanity to sell us, either - happy to believe the reports of the press when they're in awe; less so when they start printing that he's no different to any other criminal because he's out for himself. His ego needs to believe that he'll go down in legend as someone special, because he wants to make a name for himself; and notorious versus well-liked is all the same to him.Two characters who wanted adoration so much that they found it in each other. It's interesting to note the parental theme, also. They came together because we're not shown much of a stable family life; and in time they threaten to usurp the authority figures of another young outcast like themselves. (Pollard) Kids are eager to shake off their family restrictions as they yearn for freedom; but when they taste how harsh and unforgiving the real world is, it's usually Mum or Dad they come back to as the solution to all this unpleasantness. Bad upbringing is one cause; responsible guidance of children is more often than not where the preventative answer lies... 'Groundbreaking' in many senses, this film deservedly carries as much weight in the cinema community as its subjects do in the annals of 20th century lawlessness...",Bonnie and Clyde

92,frankde-jong,Rather Gun Crazy than Robin Hood,8,19 April 2021,"""Bonnie and Clyde"" was a real revolutionary film. A film lover knows that and you can see it from the final scene in which violence shown in slow motion turns into some kind of art. Watching the film recently however it striked me that for the film as a whole it is more difficult to imagine the revolutionary character at the time of release. This in contrast to a film like for example ""2001: a space odyssey"" (1968, Stanley Kubrick), that also today is easily recognised as groundbreaking.I think that a major factor in 1967 was that, despite all the violence, Bonnie and Clyde were seen as a sort of Robin Hood like. This was caused by three elements. (1) The real Bonnie and Clyde were active in 1930 - 1934 during the poverty of the great depression. (2) The scene in the beginning of the movie in which Bonnie and Clyde sympathize with a farmer evicted from his home by the bank. (3) The fact that the audience in those hippie years wanted to see them as anti establishment.Today when I have to choose a film about robbers taking revenge on banks that take away peoples homes I would settle for ""Hell or high water"" (2016, David Mackenzie). Today when I have to choose a film indicative of the hippie period I would settle for ""Easy rider"" (1969, Dennis Hopper).For me ""Bonnie and Clyde"" is the successor of ""Gun crazy"" (1950 Joseph H. Lewis) but without the production code and with influences from the French ""Nouvelle vague"". With the production code the lead characters of the impotent Clyde (Warren Beatty) and Bonnie (Faye Dunaway) filled with sexual energy would be unthinkable.""Bonnie and Clyde"" stood at the basis of important films such as ""Badlands"" (1973, Terrence Malick) and ""Thelma & Louise"" (1991, Ridley Scott)Special mention for editor Dede Allen who had done ""The hustler"" (1961, Robert Rossen) before and would do such diverse films as ""The breakfast cub"" (1985, John Hughes) and ""Wonder boys"" (2000, Curtis Hanson) afterwards.",Bonnie and Clyde

Two of the greatest performances of the time capture the menace deployed by the Barrow Gang as they carve, shoot and slaughter their way into cult stardom, both on and off screen - the super antiheroes of their day.It can be a challenge accepting interpretation over fact but if fact is a cornerstone of your experience then perhaps documentaries are more to your taste. Once you take the lives of others and throw them on the big screen it's done for entertainment not education, so you have to be prepared to take things with varying sized pinches of salt. You can always follow up the facts later if the fancy takes you.

94,seymourblack-1,A Real Game-Changer In Hollywood Filmmaking,9,6 October 2015,"By using some influences that they'd drawn from the French New Wave and ensuring that the facts didn't get in the way of a good story, screenwriters David Newman and Robert Benton produced a brilliant account of the exploits of ""Bonnie and Clyde"". Part of their success was down to the entertaining way in which the story's told but good dialogue and their depiction of the legendary bank robbers as being rebellious, fun-loving and anti-establishment also added to the appeal that the movie had, especially for young people, in the late-1960s.The way in which the story's violence is portrayed also had an enormous impact, as it was far more realistic and bloody than audiences had previously seen, with the use of slow-motion and the movie's shocking climax, both proving to be incredibly controversial.In a small town in Depression-era Texas, young waitress Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway) looks out from her bedroom window one day and sees a man who's obviously preparing to steal her mother's car. When she goes outside and speaks to Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty), she learns that he's just been released from prison where he'd served a sentence for armed robbery and after he displays his criminal skills to her by robbing a grocery store, she decides to leave her boring life behind and become his partner-in-crime.The couple's early efforts at robbery aren't very successful so they recruit a mechanic called C.W.Moss (Michael J Pollard) who becomes their getaway driver and they start robbing banks together. Later, when Clyde's brother Buck (Gene Hackman) is released from prison, he and his wife Blanche (Estelle Parsons) also join the gang. The crime spree that they then embark on soon earns them plenty of notoriety and they become the targets of a manhunt that leads to a series of dangerous and violent encounters with the police.The gang have a lot of fun and excitement together and enjoy seeing their reputation grow as well as taking photographs of themselves with a Texas Ranger who they'd tied up. Not everything goes well however, as Bonnie and Clyde's relationship is blighted by Clyde's impotence and their subsequent brushes with their pursuers lead to increasingly serious injuries and a significant betrayal.The performances of Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway and the supporting cast are excellent throughout as they provide all the energy, vitality and infectious enthusiasm that a classic ground-breaking film like this deserves. Furthermore, their ability to convey the range of emotions that their characters experience during their reckless adventure is equally impressive.A number of factors, such as the decline of the studio system, the end of the Production Code and the adoption of some of the innovations pioneered by the Nouvelle Vague directors, made it possible for director Arthur Penn to transform what could have been a very conventional gangster story into a fresh. exhilarating and incredibly influential film that not only became a huge commercial success but also a real game-changer in the history of Hollywood filmmaking.",Bonnie and Clyde
95,inspectors71,Does Iconic Mean Good?,8,18 May 2016,"I've seen Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde enough times to be able to dissect its film-making and psychology. It is a brilliant movie, but the brilliance is as much from the breaking of ground as anything. I can barely stand Faye Dunaway, a walking mannequin whose only good performance--I mean really watchable--is the damaged-beyond-repair Evelyn Mulwray from Chinatown. Warren Beatty has always given me the creeps, even when he was handsome and charming and likable in Heaven Can Wait. Gene Hackman has done very little wrong (although Riot does come to mind). With the major and minor performers out of the way, we can concentrate on the story, the never-been-done-before level of sex and violence issues, and the feeling that we're seeing something big, really big here. I read one of the great reviews of this movie by Pauline Kael of the New Yorker. I remember the elegant and personal chattiness of the writing, and I had seen the movie, so I could personalize her writing.I have no intention of going too deeply into what Penn created, nor will I write anything close to a synopsis, mainly because the movie is such an iconic piece of artwork, and it's so deeply ingrained in our culture, that to write about the who, what, and why stuff would be overkill (kind of like the last scene in the movie, right?).I recommend Bonnie and Clyde because it is a fascinating story, filled with the sort of rebellion that was so popular in the 1960s, because, even though I said I don't like the two principal performers in the movie, I think Dunaway and Beatty have a great, visceral commonality/chemistry.Even though the movie isn't terribly historically accurate, the viewer gets the feeling he or she is watching a film of significant historical and psychological importance. And to watch the movie from the position that Bonnie and Clyde is a comedy, until that man takes a bullet right in the face, and the audience sobers up very quickly, is a testament to Penn's storytelling. You're chuckling right up to that moment. It's not a cheap shot, it's how a great director manipulates an audience.",Bonnie and Clyde
96,bobsgrock,Groundbreaking in more ways than one.,8,1 June 2008,"At first glance, this film might seem to be a simple story about 2 folk legends of the Depression-era American society who shot up three states and robbed a handful of already empty banks. It is this as well as one of the first movies to ever portray violence in such a graphic way as well as mix it with such comic relief. In no other way before 1967 was violence made this mainstream and this common. It seems that director Arthur Penn was trying to make a statement and he certainly did as this film almost definitely had an effect on the next most violent movie in America, Sam Peckinpah's ode to the West: The Wild Bunch. Still, as itself, this movie stands as a pretty important one in its own right. It gives us two of the first anti-heroes; people we know are morally incompetent and deprived yet we still root for them and hope they can turn their lives around. Of course, history tells us how this film ends. And here, it is beautiful in cinematic style. The acting is very strong, especially by Beatty and Dunaway, and the quick jump-cuts of Penn make this an uptight experience. By today's standards, it is quite tame. However, you owe it to yourself to see the film that opened up the way for all others of its kind. The only difference between those movies and Bonnie and Clyde is that there is an interesting and compelling story behind this one.",Bonnie and Clyde
97,TheUnknown837-1,"""Bonnie and Clyde"" is sheer satirical brilliance",10,10 February 2010,"Violence in the cinema, to some people's dismay, has been portrayed in one of three ways in various productions. Violence is either mellow, harrowing, or glorified. Well, a picture called ""Bonnie and Clyde"" is a kind that definitely glorifies it with brutal killings that come off almost as slapstick moments in a melodramatic comedy. But you know what? It's never been done with such energy and such enthusiasm and aggression and it hasn't been done with two leading characters that come across not as lovable vigilantes or role models, but as sick, disgusting mongrels. Thus we have the brilliance of ""Bonnie and Clyde"", which to my mind, is one of the finest motion pictures ever made, if somewhat eccentric.The movie is based, of course, on the real-life story of Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow, two of the most notorious bank robbers and killers who ever lived in the United States. They robbed, killed, and fled merrily for a while in the post-Depression eras, making a big name for themselves along the way. The movie, naturally, romanticizes their story to make it more interesting, but what I really found great about this picture, is that while it does expose Bonnie and Clyde as the brutal monsters they were, it does not take a one-dimensional approach on that. It also exposes them as human beings, which, although some people find it hard to believe, they were.""Bonnie and Clyde,"" like ""Psycho"", is one of the most notorious movies in cinema history because of its presentation of violence. And for some, the artistic genius was harder to see here than it was in ""Psycho."" Reviews were split right down the middle with half the critics adoring it and half the critics hating its very existence. Roger Ebert, a film critic for a mere six months, called it the first masterpiece he saw on the job. Bosley Crowther ended his career as a film critic trying to destroy its name with his every breath. Now I have never always been in complete agreement with Mr. Ebert or Mr. Crowther – most particularly the latter – but very few other times have Mr. Ebert and I been so mirrored in our opinions and in no other case has Mr. Crowther, I say, been so far wide of the mark.The movie *does* sort of glorify violence, but I think this is an advantage to the movie. Because it does this, Bonnie and Clyde are exposed – no matter how much they bumble or cry or show a human side – revealed as sick, brutal killers who were very much owed the horrific, bloody end they received. But again, the movie also fleshes them out to show a human side, because they were people after all, and the screenwriters made a brilliant decision to guess at what it may have been rather than to just show us the same old, all-serious, no-nonsense killers that we've seen a billion times before and will continue to see a billion times down the road.Performances all around are nothing short of brilliant. Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway were fantastic in the titular roles, again fleshing out human beings instead of stick figure villains. Gene Hackman, early in his career, was very good as Clyde's equally maniacal brother. Estelle Parsons deserved the Oscar she won for her role as the enigmatic sister-in-law. And Denver Pyle is great as the tough-as-nails Texas ranger determined to bring down the notorious bank robbers.I enjoyed every single bit of ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and to my mind, it is a masterpiece. Yes, the approach on violence and sex is a bit blatant and that will be a detractor for some people, as may be the eccentric style of the dialogue, but in my opinion, it all strengths this somewhat satirical picture.",Bonnie and Clyde
98,proud_luddite,One of the best movies ever,10,21 March 2021,"This classic film depicts the famous criminals in the US south during the Depression from the time they meet until the end of their lives.I still highly admire this film even after a seventh viewing. Arthur Penn's directing provides great feeling using place, time, and people that are very different. The atmosphere is sombre (sounds of wind in deserted towns) and chaotic (amateur criminals that occasionally bungle their crimes while living life on the edge).Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty are also brilliant as the title characters. Their chemistry is strong whether in scenes as lovers, in shootouts, or finding unusual ways to have fun.There are other great performances in the film as well including Gene Hackman and Estelle Parsons as Clyde's brother and sister-in-law who join the crime gang much to Bonnie's chagrin. Gene Wilder also has a hilarious small role which was apparently his debut.The film was very bold for its time. It portrayed the leading male as impotent - something unlikely in today's hyper-macho culture. The violence was also considered shocking in its time and it still has strong impact. It's sad that other films tried to trump the violence but went too far in the shock department. As the saying goes, this film is often imitated but rarely duplicated.The only flaw in the story is in the relationship between Bonnie and her mother. Bonnie leaves her mother without a trace in the beginning of the film. Later, when there is a reunion between the two, this early departure is never dealt with - not even on a subtle level.However, this does not deter the overall greatness of this film. There are several great scenes in it. There is often a mood of impending doom with the occasional fun spirit and romance thrown in along the way. Truly superb. - dbamateurcritic

99,Karl Self,Truckdrivers or Warren Beatty,5,21 February 2016,"Bonnie and Clyde is maybe one of those classics that didn't age well, maybe because the world around it has changed so much since 1967. The movie that I saw last night had some nice aspects to it, nice characterisations, Faye Dunaway looks amazing, and there is also a healthy dose of reality in that Clyde isn't depicted as the dashing bankrobber but, while physically still very handsome, really he's a small time thief with a big time gun.There is a lot of wobbly camera and a meandering story. I had the impression that some of the scenes had been written the night before, to fill in time. Worst of all, the story is totally linear. At first Bonnie hooks up with Clyde, we get to believe how they form a relationship, then they hang out with a lot of people with very bad dialogues, and then we all know how it ends.",Bonnie and Clyde
100,jhclues,A Landmark Film,10,21 February 2001,"A minute or so into the first scene (which begins with a close-up of a luscious, red-lipsticked, sensuous mouth) a young woman goes to the window of her second story bedroom and looks down on a young man milling about the family car parked in front of the house.  `Hey, Boy!' she calls to him, `What c'you doin' with my mama's car?'  And with that, the world got it's first glimpse of what was to become one of the most celebrated couples in cinematic gangsterdom, as portrayed by Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, in `Bonnie & Clyde,' directed by Arthur Penn and produced by Beatty.  The red lips, of course, belong to Bonnie Parker (Dunaway), and in the first moments of the film, as she looks at herself in the mirror, then sprawls pensively across her bed, you feel her sense of longing, of wanting `something,' of yearning for that intangible element that is seemingly just beyond her grasp.  And then she meets Clyde Barrow (Beatty).  Just released from prison, Clyde has a twinkle in his eye and a devil-may-care attitude that fits Bonnie's needs like a hand in a glove; and so begins the story of two real life criminals as they embark upon their now legendary, if infamous, spree of bank robberies and murder.  How they actually met and came together is of no consequence here; the fact is, it happened, and unbeknownst to Bonnie and Clyde, their exploits and short lives would become--some thirty-odd years later-- the subject of a cinematic masterpiece. 	Beatty makes few movies, which apparently works to his advantage, because when he does, it's usually a film worth waiting for.  And this is arguably one of his best, if not the best, he's every done.  As Clyde, Beatty fairly oozes charm, with a down-home, southern, easy-going manner that belies who and what his character really is.  But Beatty makes him memorable with an Oscar worthy performance in the role that will most likely be THE one for which he will be remembered, and with good reason, for he has never before or since been more charismatic or accessible than he is here.  It is quite simply a remarkable performance by a talented actor at the top of his form. And Faye Dunaway, as well, has never been more beautiful or appealing, ever. Period.  Her Bonnie is without question the stuff of which legends are born.  But does her portrayal reflect the real Bonnie Parker? Of course not; neither does Beatty's reflect the real Clyde Barrow.  But Dunaway's work here is nothing less than extraordinary and-- as with Beatty's Clyde-- this will probably be the role for which she will be remembered, as it showcases not only her exquisite beauty but here abilities as an actress more than any other part she's played, including her role in `Network,' for which she won the Oscar for Best Actress. 	As the director, Arthur Penn-- it goes without saying-- played a tremendous part in the success of this film.  It may have been Beatty's vision originally, but it was Penn who summarily made it his own and brought it to fruition.  His handling of the camera to enhance the drama of the story is acute, from his use of close-ups (as in the opening scene of Dunaway's mouth, and later her eyes), to the more expansive vistas he uses to capture the action that is so well choreographed and staged.  His pacing of the film, which maintains the necessary tension and emotional level throughout, is perfect, and the expertise through which he elicits exemplary performances from his actors is evident.  Of all the elements that go into the making of a great film, choosing the right director is of unparalleled concern, and in this case it is obvious that Penn was indeed the right man for the job. 	The memorable supporting cast includes Michael J. Pollard (C.W. Moss), Gene Hackman (Buck Barrow), Denver Pyle (Frank Hamer), Dub Taylor (Ivan Moss) and Estelle Parsons, as Blanche Barrow, the role for which she received the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.  A landmark film, `Bonnie & Clyde' has received criticism for glamorizing the lives of notorious criminals; but upon reflection, though the stars involved may have `beautified' the subjects of the film, there is certainly nothing in the presentation of the way they lived, and especially the way they died, that could be construed as `glamorous.'  What this film does, however-- and so successfully-- is evoke a sense of the desperation of a particular time and place in the history of America.  Some may deem this perspective of infamy as politically incorrect; but the Great Depression was a fact of life, and gangsters like Bonnie and Clyde-- as with Jesse James before them-- were often hailed as heroes by certain factions who were themselves struggling to stay alive.  The importance of a film like this, or perhaps on a grander scale, one like `Schindler's List,' is that it maintains an awareness of events that for posterity simply must not be forgotten.  I rate this one 10/10.",Bonnie and Clyde
101,johno-21,One of the best gangster films ever and one of the best films of the 1960's,10,5 March 2006,"I saw this in the theater during it's initial release and saw it a couple more times in the theater and at least a dozen times on TV. Based on the story of the bank robbing doomed lovers and their murderous gang it is largely fictional as a dramatization and highly stylized. This depicted graphic violence that was shocking for it's time that probably kept it from winning more of the 10 Academy Awards it was nominated for along with the perception that it glorified criminals even though it concluded that crime doesn't pay. Bonnie and Clyde was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director for Arthur Penn, Best Actor for it's 28 year old Producer and star Wareen Beatty, Best Actress for the unknown Faye Dunaway, Best Supporting Actor with two nominations, for television character actor Michael Pollard and Gene Hackman who had some previous movie and television roles, Best Supporting Actress for Estelle Parsons who had little film and television roles previous to Bonnie and Clyde. Parsons would win the Oscar for her role as the neurotic wife of Clyde's brother Buck Barrow. The only other Oscar it would win was for the film's beautiful Cinematography. It was also nominated for Screenplay and Costume Design. It probably should have been nominated for best song with ""Foggy Mountain Breakdown"" which was part of it's wonderful bluegrass flavored soundtrack that perfectly scored the film's depression era setting in Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana. In addition it should have been nominated for best sound. Besides the great central cast this film also has in supporting roles, veteran character actors Denver Pyle and Dub Taylor and introduces Gene Wilder. Arthur Penn directed a great movie in Bonnie and Clyde and I would give it a 10 and highly recommend it.",Bonnie and Clyde
102,aciessi,Police and Thieves.,10,23 December 2019,"Some films truly stand the test of time. Bonnie and Clyde is one of those films. It's not a good film, or a great film.. no, it's way beyond that. It's one of those rare flawless masterpieces that audiences of any age bracket can walk away from with their minds blown. 1967 was the year cinema changed forever. If The Graduate was the flash point, Bonnie and Clyde was the inferno. Hollywood was known for making cops and robber capers. This was the first one that felt truly real. Bonnie and Clyde were not portrayed in that classic Hollywood way. Not as a couple in a simmering noire or as star-crossed lovers in a light romp. They are nuts, and raw, and rugged. They scare the crap out of you. When they put a gun to your head to empty the cash register, you believe them. In terms of character, this approach changes everything. It's a challenge all by itself to make the bad guys the characters to root for, it's another challenge when you allow them to be entirely unlikeable and cruel. To that effect, we get perhaps the most engaging, nail-biting action thriller of all time. Arthur Penn doesn't wrack your nerves, he electrifies them. Paired with an incredible dual performance by Gene Hackman and Estelle Parsons as the second rung of common bank robbers that come along for the ride. As we spend more time with Bonnie and Clyde, the walls continue to close in, until there's no way to escape their retribution. That being, an epic shoot-out that shocked audiences around the world as the first splatter-fest of any mainstream American motion picture. Talk about going out in a blaze of glory.",Bonnie and Clyde
103,Stampsfightclub,powerful society driven crime drama,8,4 December 2006,"The narrative:Is a passionate true story revolving around the lives of two criminals, Bonnie and Clyde. I was shocked to find out this was a true story. I had the same view about Catch me of you can, I was amazed to find these events actually happened. It's a truly remarkable energetic-filled story about survival, desperation, law and family loyalty. The car chases, gun fights, running and fighting are very brutal for the time the film was released. Critics have labelled it shocking and I can understand that as many scenes are very brutal, not compared to today's conventional action scenes but enough to awaken audiences in the late 60's. It did not centre on the love side of their relationship as I would have thought but more on current society values and what they were living in, allowing for a wide spread view on law and order at the time it was written. Some scenes I personally felt were a bit questionable and may have dragged for too long but once I had watched the film all the way through I recalled them and remained faithful as each scene was vital to the film's brilliance. The ending is remarkable, a real shock to my system which leaved many questions in my mind and is without a doubt one of the best endings I have seen in recent times. The setting is also outstanding as they travel across Texas, capturing amazing scenery and rightfully earning an Oscar for best cinematography. Bonnie and Clyde.Dunaway and Beatty strike a perfect relationship in this film to carry it forward. Both perform amazingly as the enlightening couple with many issues in their lives. The two work well off each other and rightfully deserved their Oscar nominations. Having too very different central characters allows tension and mystery to be created, creating awareness and excitement which fulfils audience's uses and gratifications. This is one of the best on screen couples I have ever seen in motion picture history. The challenging aspect of the crime world is great for these two and the sense of a challenge and excitement fulfilled an action packed love story. The couple makes the film what it is and their relationship with C.W (played expertly by Michael Pollard) adds a great sense of friendship and loyalty and drive to an overall great inspiration and breathtaking movie. Then and now.Audiences in the 21st century may find it difficult to comprehend certain values and what this film may have meant to people at the time of release (1967) From the reactions and praise and critics the film has received I can understand the significance. The very brutal violent action sequences show what cinema was coming to at the time and I'm sure paved the way for more brutal films to follow. Now its all blood and guts, all about the effects and the amounts of kills the hero figure can score. But then is more of the significance and consequence of the actions. Killing people with many laws and regulations was a serious business and for film watchers this film must have been very shocking. a powerful film and is an essential watch",Bonnie and Clyde
104,KnightsofNi11,The infamous duo as Hollywood sees it,8,25 June 2012,"History has a tendency to blow things out of proportion, especially in the case of our revered/reviled anti-hero characters. Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow are two such figures whose legacy has been idealized and romanticized throughout history, and the film about them, Bonnie and Clyde, is plenty guilty of romanticizing the murderous bank robbers, but subsequently it's now considered a classic and is actually a very well made film.Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty play Bonnie and Clyde, respectively, and they each do a fantastic job at pulling off these two unique characters. I obviously can't speak for how accurately they portrayed the real Bonnie and Clyde but they certainly do an excellent job at making them lovable and exciting characters to watch have adventures on screen. Beatty plays Clyde as a man who puts on a rough and tough no holds bars face but really has a soft spot within him. And the stunning Faye Dunaway plays Bonnie as the insanely cool and wickedly ruthless girlfriend who always wants to be part of what's happening and is never afraid of the consequences. Together they make Bonnie and Clyde such an awesome pairing that we root for the entirety of the film.Now, from what I've read Bonnie and Clyde takes some liberties with what really happened, some of them unfair changes to characters just for the sake of idealizing the story. For instance, Estelle Parsons plays Blanche, Clyde's sister in law who comes along to join the Barrow gang with Clyde's brother Buck, played by Gene Hackman. The real Blanche Barrow was still alive when this film came out and was disgusted by the way her character was portrayed and real life accounts of the Barrow gang say that Blanche was not the terrified screaming maniac that she was in the film. Part of me wishes that these sorts of things wouldn't have happened, but then again it is Hollywood and it's just a movie that doesn't claim to be 100% accurate. Therefore I can put it behind me because the result of these alterations to history made by the filmmakers make Bonnie and Clyde a much more exciting and fun filled film.Overall Bonnie and Clyde is great. It's a lot of fun, tells a great story of two of America's most infamous outlaws, and is even a little artsy in its production. If you're offended by films that change history for their own gain then you might not be too partial to the film, but if you could care less then just sit back and enjoy Bonnie and Clyde.",Bonnie and Clyde
105,khanbaliq2,The turning point from Hollywood's moribund studio system to the impending youthquake of the 1970s.,10,30 June 2010,"The film works as comedy, as tragedy, as entertainment, as a meditation on the place of guns and violence in American society. In the early 1930s, a car thief (Warren Beatty) and the daughter (Faye Dunaway) of his intended victim team up to become America's most feared and ruthless bank robbers.Bonnie And Clyde is a technically brilliant evocation of sleepy mid-America at the time of the 'Public Enemies,' using every kind of cinematic trick including fake snapshots, farcical interludes, dreamy soft-focus and a jazzy score. It failed to draw sizeable audiences or overwhelmingly positive reviews on its immediate release, and the studio effectively dumped it. But among its champions, it became a huge talking point: no-one had seen such glamorisation of criminals in a mainstream studio film, nor the abrupt switches of mood between comic moments and murderous brutality. Director Arthur Penn drew on the French New Wave auteurs for his visual style, and to earlier American B-films (notably Gun Crazy) that had in turn inspired them. The film looked chic, cool and ground-breaking, and eventually audiences - and awards - came its way. It remains a landmark American film.",Bonnie and Clyde
106,gab-14712,One of Cinema's Most Influential Movies!,9,6 September 2020,"1967's Bonnie and Clyde changed the landscape of American movies in a major way. This picture allowed movies with gratuitous violence and realistic sex scenes to make their way to the forefront. This is the picture that allows us to see movies as we today in today's modern cinema. Detractors criticize the film for allowing heavy violence that we see in nearly every film. With the changes made to 1960's cinema, one can easily forget that this is actually a very good film. It tells the story about the famed criminal duo Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow. Robert Benton's screenplay allows for ripe characterization and Arthur Penn's direction was smooth and had the perfect landing.Robert Benton, who created the screenplay with David Newman, molded his script around the French New Wave movement, which some characteristics you can see in the final product including jarring, sudden shifts in tone and choppy editing which comes to play near the film's end. Benton got French names such as Francois Truffaut and Jean-Loc Gudard to take interest in his script, but they turned the film down. Warren Beatty was in Paris at the time where he learned of the script and then decided to pursue the movie as actor/producer. Warner Brothers definitely had some concern. They did not like that the film took somewhat of a comedic view of the studio's 1930's gangster films heyday and of course they felt the audience would not like the violence. Boy, were they ever wrong.We cannot effectively talk about the movie if we cannot mention the floodgates it opened in terms of violence. Prior to this film, most shootings were bloodless, and victims did not suffer. Penn gave his audience a much-needed jolt as he introduced bloody realism to the picture. The ending, during the famous shootout, Penn did not hold back. Honestly, I would have loved to travel back in time so I could document the shock on the audience's faces. This film, in the short-term, allowed films like The Wild Bunch to be made. In the long-term, it allowed blood and violence to be portrayed in a realistic manner, perhaps even too much so. Regardless, the audience loved it and Warner Brothers were surprised at the box office receipts. They hardly promoted the picture, but it ultimately became a box office smash.Like all films depicting true events, they take liberty upon the source material so do not expect every scene to be factual. Bonnie (Faye Dunaway) is a gum-chewing waitress and Clyde (Warren Beatty) is a felon just out of prison. They meet by chance in Dallas and thus the beginning of their world-famous relationship. Despite loaded guns, they originally had no plan to kill people. All they wanted to do was rob banks...and have fun. They recruit a mechanic, C.W. Moss (Michael J. Pollard) as their getaway driver, Clyde's older brother Buck (Gene Hackman) and his spouse Blanche (Estelle Parsons) to finalize their gang. Eventually, they start killing and terrorizing the Midwestern towns. Ranger Frank Hamer (Denver Pyle), comes out of retirement, to track down the gang and protect the law.Mostly, the performances were fantastic. The film allowed Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway to go to stardom. Beatty made an unlikely Clyde, but his performance won me over. Dunaway is stunning beautiful and delivers an excellent performance. Both actors have wonderful chemistry. Dunaway, in particular, shows some great acting chops in two scenes that come to mind; the scene where she interacts with Moss for the first time, and the scene with her mother. Pollard and Hackman likewise do an excellent job. Ironically enough, I did not buy Estelle Parsons's performance...and neither did she. She has an amusing quote that describes her characterization. She was annoying and loud...and somehow won the Academy Award. Oh, keep an eye out for Gene Wilder as one of the gang's hostages. This is his film debut.The studio thought Bonnie and Clyde was destined for failure. Instead, it became a box office hit and was nominated for ten Academy Awards and winning two of them. The movie doesn't play these characters as a straight drama. More humor than expected was involved which led to some interesting tone shifts. Burnett Guffey's cinematography is incredible, and I really enjoyed the atmospheric music from Charles Strouse. The movie packs plenty of power and the ending is awesome. It still made me jump despite being used to violent films. This is one of the most influential films in cinema because it introduced change, change that allows us to see the type of films we see today. But do not forget that this is still a great movie.My Grade: A",Bonnie and Clyde
107,SmileysWorld,"Good portrayal,but nothing heroic about them.",7,2 January 2005,"Upon reading other reviewers statements praising the film,as well as their statements that they found themselves ""rooting"" for the pair to make it,I feel obliged to put my own two cents in.While this is an excellent film overall and an excellent portrayal of the infamous pair, I came away not seeing them as heroes in any shape or form.In fact,if they were portrayed accurately,these people were cold hearted robbers and killers that got what they deserved.That being said,it is still a great film from start to finish,with a cast that,if it had been appropriate,should have lined up and taken a bow at the end.Excellent early performance for Gene Hackman,but is he ever bad?

108,Pedro_H,Powerful crime drama that scores on most fronts.,9,23 April 2003,"A small time crook and a waitress hook-up during the Great Depression and go on a crime spree that shocks America.One hell of a good story to base a movie around, but that doesn't mean the producers haven't done a fantastic job in squeezing so much juice out of so many basically uneducated - and unethical - characters.Few films deliver laughs, thrills, sexual tension, violence and music in one basket, let alone do them all so well. When I first saw this film I thought it was the best (serious) movie I had I had then seen in my young life and I still rate it in my all-time top ten. The fact that it glamorises two criminals (although they worked in a gang) on the fast track to destruction should not be ignored, but the film does not shy away from the truth. People that tried to stop them often ended up dead.(While Tarantino was still in short trousers here was a film that goes from comedy to murder in the blink of an eye.)The real surprise is the cinematography and the background acting. It really does look like the backwaters of central America, the people they meet really do look and sound like country (rather than urban) people with a different value system. The twangy banjo soundtrack seals the effect.Naturally it can be fun to compare the known facts to the on-screen fiction. Bonnie Parker's liking for bad boys goes back longer than Clyde Barrow. Barrow's sexuality is dealt with in a confused fashion (most respected biographers have him as bisexual), hinting that he is initially impotent rather than gay. The principles received lots of awards (although not the Best Picture Oscar it deserved) and the movie helped shape cinema for years to come. A powerful and unforgettable film that is very well produced and directed and doesn't contain one ounce of spare fat. In fact I wish it went on a little bit longer.",Bonnie and Clyde

It has all of the elements of a great film, and it is certainly engaging.It's been a few years since I have seen this, but we watched it in a film history class, where we discussed life in the Great Depression, and Bonnie and Clyde apparently portrayed that well...as well as producing a controversial film.

110,tonypeacock-1,Forerunner of every violent film that followed,8,29 November 2018,"A film from 1967 that sort of paved the way for violent/adult Hollywood cinema for the years ahead.I mean that films as iconic as The Godfather franchise, Unforgiven et al. might never have happened had it not been for the style of film exhibited here by director Arthur Penn.The story is a 1930s set graphically violent depiction of American outlaws Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow played excellently by Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty respectively.
It has elements of the Robin Hood story, showing them rob from mainly banks across several southern U.S. states.It also shows the love that blossoms between the two (despite Clydes impotence).
The support cast provide excellent service including the two Genes, Hackman as Clydes brother Buck who faces a bloody death and the late Gene Wilder.The film ends with the bloody death, I mean are sub machine guns necessary?
Excellent depiction and a forerunner for every outlaw film that was to follow.",Bonnie and Clyde
111,grahamsj3,Can you say violent?,8,8 March 2005,"This film was extremely violent for it's time. Of course, Bonnie and Clyde lived violent lives and the law eventually had to get violent back at them. This is a highly romanticized version of the lives of the famous Barrow gang who made a living robbing banks. If someone got killed while doing it, too bad (unless it was a Police Officer, of course). The film is superbly cast, with Warren Beatty as Clyde, Faye Dunaway as Bonnie, Gene Hackman as Buck, Estelle Parsons as Blanche and Michael J. Pollard as CW Moss. The Law is mainly Denver Pyle. With such a stellar cast, you could expect great acting, and they all deliver! The music chosen to accompany this film was also perfect - Flatt and Scruggs (mainly) bluegrass - banjo and fiddle only, for the most part. It added significantly to the ""hillbilly-ness"" of the whole mood. However, the most interesting part of this entire production is the way the story is written - from the outlaw side. By the bloody end of this film, the audience is nearly rooting for Bonnie and Clyde rather than the law. The end comes very violently for the outlaws and much of the audience was sad for the way it ended. However, I have seen a photograph of the car they were in and it was absolutely and totally riddled with bullet holes. The cinematographer made sure we saw their demise in slow motion, with every bullet that hit them causing their bodies to flail and jerk around. The ambush scene was considered to be almost too much for the day. An altogether excellent production!",Bonnie and Clyde

Terrific performances abound not only from stars Beatty, Dunaway, and Hackman but also from the supporting cast. The best moment of the film is when our heroes eyes meet before the end. I don't know if this is hearsay or not but someone mentioned that a homosexual undertone between C.W. and Clyde was written out of the original script. Other notes: I think Dunaway mentioned that she borrowed her sassy walk from Joanne Woodward in Long Hot Summer and she also paid an homage to Jeanne Moreau in Les Amants in the way she blew on the cigar. A true classic, 10/10.",Bonnie and Clyde
113,elvircorhodzic,...these bullets kill actually...,9,2 December 2017,"BONNIE AND CLYDE is an action crime drama film about a pair of notorious robbers who have robbed banks during the Great Depression. It's a ruthless and cruel story that looks nice, touchy and fresh in small sequences. This movie is not a faithful representation of the desperado careers of Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, a notorious team of bank robbers and killers who roamed Texas and Oklahoma in the post-Depression years. I think that is the best, otherwise, in some more realistic view, all the charm and humor of this movie would be lost.In the middle of the Great Depression, Clyde and Bonnie meet when Clyde tries to steal Bonnie's mother's car. Bonnie is excited by Clyde's outlaw demeanor, and he further stimulates her by robbing a store in her presence. Clyde steals a car, with Bonnie in tow, and their legendary crime spree begins. The duo's crime spree shifts into high gear once they hook up with a dim-witted gas station attendant, C.W. Moss, then with Clyde's older brother Buck and his wife, Blanche, a preacher's daughter...The biggest controversy of this film is through the fact that the young audience likes classic anti-heroic characters. However, those characters are people who love, suffer, and have quite ordinary life problems and dilemmas. They simply run away from themselves. Ultimately, they die in one of the most spectacular and the most horrible scenes in cinematic history. This movie has hit a taste of a subculture just like ""The Graduate"". I think this story does not bring a nostalgic charm, but it fits in a rebellious nature of the 1960s.The characterization could be better, however a scenery and atmosphere are great.Warren Beatty as Clyde Barrow is sympathetically unhappy and stubborn. He is trying to be faced with life problems in an inherent way. Mr. Beatty has offered a solid performance. Faye Dunaway as Bonnie Parker is a young woman who wants a kind of change and excitement in her life. It may be just a flight from ordinary suffering or love for rebellion. Regardless of all a beautiful Miss Dunaway has stolen this show.Their support are Gene Hackman(Buck Barrow) with his bad jokes, Estelle Parsons (Blanche Barrow) as an irritating wife and Michael J.

115,virek213,The kickoff in the debate about cinematic violence,10,17 July 2001,"There is very little doubt that Arthur Penn's 1967 film BONNIE AND CLYDE is a masterpiece of its era.  Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty portray the two notorious Depression-era bank robbers of the Midwest with great zeal; and even though the REAL story is over-romanticized by screenwriters David Newman and Robert Benton, it still crackles with excitement.  Estelle Parsons won a Best Supporting Actress role as Blanche Barrow, and Burnet Guffey won a statuette for Cinematography.  The film also introduced us to Gene Wilder and Michael J. Pollard, as well as made a certified star out of Gene Hackman.  Dub Taylor also appears as Pollard's strict father.All of these elements are what make BONNIE AND CLYDE a great movie.  But what gives this film historical importance is that it kicked off the debate about graphic violence in the movies that continues to this day.  The minute Beatty is forced to put a bullet through a shopkeeper's eye during a fumbled grocery store hold-up marked the end of clean violence.  The film escalates to Hackman's getting his head blown off, Beatty being blasted in the shoulder, and finally the thirty-second sequence at the end of Beatty and Dunaway taking hundreds of bullets.  The impact of such scenes still remains, even though the epic carnage of THE WILD BUNCH was only two years away.Such controversial elements aside, BONNIE AND CLYDE accurately captures the feel of Depression-era America and gives it a parallel to the rebellion taking place in the America of 1967.  It is also boosted by a twangy folk-music score, including Flatt and Scruggs' hard-driving ""Foggy Mountain Breakdown.""  Not to be missed!",Bonnie and Clyde

Bank robbers, gun-totting killers, they've been the rage since the inception of the film industry, and still to this day we get gangster flicks made by the bucket load, though Bonnie and Clyde is not your usual gangster flick.Within Bonnie and Clyde, there is something more that many other gangster films do not have. The film turns these straight-up criminals - the ultimate anti-heroes who kill, cheat, and steal to live - into loving and endearing characters that this is simply their way of life, their profession, like a person dressing up and going to work. They don't kill unless they have to for survival of their way of life, and even when they do kill, they feel remorse. Not only that, the romance between Bonnie and Clyde is believable and is actually, in my own opinion, one of the finer on screen romances of all-time.At the beginning of the film, Clyde comes sweeping into the small Texan town in which Bonnie lives working as a waitress, and Clyde after an attempt to steal Bonnie's mom's car, ultimately charms Bonnie with his criminal ways and convinces her to run off with him. In all actuality, this is the only part of the film in which I do not like, the whole opening sequence feeling awfully contrived, but the rest of the film really kicks off from there and doesn't stop. Bonnie grows from the small town girl into a swift and charming gangster with a heart of gold, just like Clyde. In a way them and their gang are similar to a modern day Robin Hood and his Merry Men. Sure they steal and kill, but they do it to not only survive, but is evidenced when Clyde meets a man whose house was foreclosed upon by the local bank, he proceeds to try and rob the bank.The film is the one credited for making both Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway stars as Clyde and Bonnie respectively, and they are both deserving of credit, in particular Dunaway who kind of acts as the anchor to the whole emotional component of the film. Bonnie very often feels sadness for leaving her life with her mother behind in Texas, and it is that emotion she feels and her desire to just slow down and live a normal life with Clyde, which Dunaway conveys beautifully to the audience.While Bonnie and Clyde may not be the finest gangster film ever made, it is one of the more unique ones ever made and is a classic through and through that is worth watching for any fan of film.I give Bonnie and Clyde a 9 out of 10!",Bonnie and Clyde

Pollard) to the gang, they become targets of the police who will spare no effort to arrest them or kill them, a great cinema classic that still has Gene Wilder (died 2016 aged 83) in the cast, directed by Arthur Penn (died 2010 aged 88), based on true events and winner from 2 Oscar (photo and supporting role for Parsons) Bonnie & Clyde is the portrait of a complicated time and at the same time the bond of a couple caused a great disturbance and death trail for those who crossed their path.A great classic that marked an era and stereotyped when talking about couples with very strong bonds, whether for good or bad things, especially in past decades, when they didn't say ""Bonnie & Clyde couple"" I heard this a lot as a child, it was also a trend in Hollywood that later bet many times on fatale couples like that, apart from taking place in a time of recession and even with not-so-good speeches and the huge technical limitations of the 60s, manages to get along well as things were, reading about the real story, this film is relieved, the crimes that happen here are either accidental deaths or self-defense, second documented not all were like this, in addition to involving other types of crimes, in this long story the story remains well developed because we have the couple's problems, in addition to the relationship with the gang members who arrive after the protagonists are well established in the plot, the police and chase part is quite flawed, they could have worked better to give the final remarkable impact, speaking of this decisive clash... is of a violence that today you would be a bit like with the scene, imagine at the time.It's very difficult to talk about editing because those were complicated times, which literally had to cut film from the roll to edit, so it's important to mention, western photography is beautiful, soundtrack and sound effects are very good, the performances are for the expense , except for the beautiful Dunaway and their brother-in-law (Hackman and Parsons) who are doing very well in the long run, we have an interesting journey, especially when it focused only on the criminal couple, in the most practically full dated, but one day when I have time to watching something old and that made history by telling in a simple way how a couple in a short time became number 1 enemies of the American police at the time until it's worth it... because they bring a good story, despite some flawed development, performances in the average that were ok and with sound and visual part that really impresses for being from 1967.Film viewed on the 13th to the 14th of July 2021.",Bonnie and Clyde
119,RossRivero99,Brilliant gangster movie,10,20 November 2014,"Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde is a gangster movie like no other one I have ever seen before as well as being one of the most diverse compared to the other gangster movies I have seen like Goodfellas (1990), Angels with Dirty Faces (1938), American Gangster (2007), Bugsy (1991),and The Departed (2006). The movie tells the true romantic crime story of Bonnie Parker (played by Faye Dunaway) and Clyde Barrow (played by Warren Beatty)who rob banks but however are not particularly good at it except for the entrance and escape parts of their robberies. Then later in the movie Clyde's brother Buck (played by Gene Hackman in an Oscar nominated performance)and his wife Blanche (played by Estelle Parsons in an Oscar winning performance). The way that Penn directs this film is very realistic (besides romantic) especially with the end scene, and I almost forgot to mention is the brilliant performance by Michael J. Pollard as C.W. Moss a former auto repair shop worker and a new member on the Barrow gang. Fantastic movie",Bonnie and Clyde
120,vampyrecowboy,Not as good as I heard.,3,30 November 2008,"I was really looking forward to this.I waited for a long time..years in fact to see this.Today I did.Aside of Bonie looking pretty damn hot in every shot..the rest of the movie sucks.Even Gene Hackman and Gene Wilder can't make this movie a kick ass hit to e.As good as they are in their own talents, they just don't bring this script to life.The dialog is boring..very dreary.The action is lame...even by standards of 1967 and the casting is all wrong.The writing is just horrible.What saves this by any means is Bonie's pretty face and the fact that there are some decent rides.Now...I am proud to state that for a short time, I had possession of Bonnie and Clyde's REAL original car where they died. (not the movie car) But I never knew much about them...So, as I watched this, I was really looking forward to the movie because I actually owned a piece of history for a brief moment in time.This movie was a let down to me..and if this is what quality film aking is, then that is pretty pathetic and downright sad.Something I could not understand is...even if Clyde was gay..how can he not be turned on by Bonnie? She could make any man hard...I would have done her easy every chance I got.In terms of violence..wow...how lame.In terms of sexy or even romantic - hahahahaha.Suspense - NOPE... Tension....forget it.Robbing banks was so easy to do in those days, I am surprised that they didn't live longer.To me, this movie is just a joke at what could have been a really cool movie - even though it was made late 60's..It could have had aggression and some sort of sparkle and charm to it.This however just is a drag...except for Bonie's hot body - which Fay Dunaway looks fine...So...writing is pretty crappy from the very beginning to the end.And I'm surprised that as famous as these two people are - as well as the rest of their gang, that a better movie could not have been made.With all the writers in Hollywood and a big budget for that time period...this sucks.",Bonnie and Clyde
121,oOoBarracuda,"""I'm from Wisconsin originally, where the cheese comes from.""",7,2 June 2016,"The story of Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow is the stuff of folklore legend. Arthur Penn brought the legend to the big screen in his 1967 feature starring Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway in the film Bonnie and Clyde. Telling the story of a criminal duo bound together by a love for each other and a lust for robbing banks, Bonnie and Clyde is a seminal work to come out of the 1960's. Finding a place in the world can lead some people to interesting places and life experiences, never more apparent than with the story of Bonnie and Clyde. After a chance meeting when a young Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty) is attempting to break into waitress Bonnie Parker's (Faye Dunaway) mother's car, the two instantly fall in love. Smitten with the stories of Clyde's travels and criminal past, Bonnie decides to leave her humdrum existence in Texas and follow Clyde as he treks across the country, state by state, looking for vulnerable banks to rob and cars to steal. Attached to no one but each other, the two remain solely focused on travel and fun, by any means to attain both. Although the two are never without a loaded gun, it is not their desire to hurt anyone, or take any individual's money, only the money in the banks. Also in their tight circle are Clyde's brother Buck Barrow (Gene Hackman), his wife Blanche (Estelle Parsons), and C.W. Moss (Michael J. Pollard) a meager mechanic. As the notoriety regarding the Barrow gang spreads from state to state faster than they do, many people are on the hunt for the group looking to bring about their death or capture for a profit. With only each other to rely on, the Barrow gang attempts to outrun all others and keep their lifestyles and lives intact.The film starts off in a great way with title cards and real pictures of Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow adding to the mystique of the duo. The thing that worked best in this film was its pacing, Arthur Penn wasted no time delving into the depths of the story, introducing the two love birds and sending them off to a life of crime together all in the first 20 minutes of the film. The color in this film was fantastic, flexing the muscles that color films from the 60's could have, which is often overlooked. Gene Hackman was fantastic in this role as the doting, take charge, brother yet adoring husband. The music was also a highlight of the feature, especially in its fantastic use of diegetic sound. Each piece of this film's puzzle comes together in a beautiful fashion all the way through the powerful final scene. Bonnie and Clyde would be the first film role for Gene Wilder, and he acted his limited part with exceptional nuance. Adding subtle comedy to the scene, as only Gene Wilder could do, was never envisioned by director Arthur Penn. Being pleasantly surprised by the comedic rendition, Penn left it as is creating a type of character we would see Gene capture in many films to come. The gentle yet manic character that teeters a line only Wilder can walk is one audiences can still be thankful for to this day. I am thankful for Arthur Penn's wonderful film Bonnie and Clyde and the introduction of Gene WIlder through it.",Bonnie and Clyde
122,thejcowboy22,My little Sister watched this movie 4 times in one day!,7,15 March 2017,"The Bel-aire Theater late April 1967 spring vacation week. My friends and I piled into my neighbors station wagon to the movies in Valley Stream, New York to view the new hit motion picture Bonnie And Clyde. Songs were written and heard throughout that year about the movie which struck an appeal to the tune of ticket receipts in the neighborhood of $70,000,000 world wide and recently an additional in DVD rentals $22,000,000 today. Meanwhile Actor Warren Beatty who is coming off a host of bad films since Splendor In The Grass comes back to life portraying the Robin Hood Type Clyde Barrow fresh out of Prison who meets a very attractive Bonnie Parker(Faye Dunnaway) in A Texas drugstore during the height of the depression era. They start pulling bank jobs from Arkansas to Missouri as they encounter car trouble and add get-away-man and mechanic C. W. Motts (Michael Pollard) into the fold . The three become the Barrow gang when they meet up with Clyde's older and unrestrained brother Buck (Gene Hackman)and his often hysterical Wife Blanche (Estelle Parsons). The violence is harsh but balanced with a comedic undertone with bluegrass accompaniment by musical director Charles Strouse. Hackman/Parson one liners plus a cameo from Gene Wilder add to the comic relief which is basically a violent shoot-em-up cops and robbers movie.I'm glad Warner Brothers decided to shoot the movie in color as apposed to black and white. The wardrobe of our two bank rogues is quite colorful with vibrant colors and pinstripe. Bravo costume designer Theadora Van Runkle. Beatty and Dunnaway looked more like fashion models throughout the picture. Such a handsome couple on film. Some view this movie as another anti-establishment movie which added the appeal and full movie houses at that turbulent time. The audiences fell in love with Bonnie and Clyde as I found that we were routing for them through each bank robbery. My younger sister Lori and friend George stayed on for three more viewings. Thank goodness my Mother during Dinner asked me where my sister was? I was stunned and realized she never left the theater. Just one of those pictures you never get tired of. FYI Gene Wilder and Estelle Parsons film debut. TV character actors Denver Pyle and Dub Taylor round out the cast.",Bonnie and Clyde
123,DareDevilKid,"The 'Lead Performances', 'Faye Dunnaway' & some 'Thrilling Real Action Scenes' are what makes this movie watchable. But is it a Classic...?",6,4 February 2009,"'Bonnie & Clyde'...I heard so much praise about this movie, that I was anxiously waiting an opportunity to view it. 2 days ago, I was lucky enough to be provided a copy from a friend. That day, I came home from work(having had a relatively good day), served myself some scrumptious dinner prepared by my mother, & we sat down to enjoy an already declared classic. So, did the movie deliver the goods as expected from its hype? Well...not really!Right from the opening credits, the director & star producer's intentions of transcending the movie to the realms of a classic gangster-noir were evident. But alas, it fails to transgress that realm of classic, full-on gangster movies('The Godfather', 'The Departed', 'The Killing', 'Scarface', 'City Of God',...)& stutters at the periphery.The movie did begin well & my expectations further soared. But midway until the conclusion, the screenplay(this movie's major hurdle)& direction kept deteriorating.Bonnie(Faye Dunnaway)& Clyde(Warren Beaty)have a chance encounter, are drawn towards each other, both physically & professionally & later on even emotionally & together they begin traversing their path of crime...fair enough. The initial two heists are well picturised & that's way the movie abruptly halts its ascent. After that, all Bonnie & Clyde & their gang do, is run from the law. Why is the law frantically pursuing them is only shown via some newspaper columns, albeit read by the characters themselves. If the gang was so dreaded & sought after, then they should have been shown pulling off more daring and meticulously documented robberies(like in 'The Killing'). Newspaper columns alone, won't stir the audiences senses of interest for the gangsters & thrill for their con jobs. And what was that distorted bit about Clyde unable to make love to Bonnie. What really holds this movie together, are the performances by the lead pair as well as the supporting actors. Both Warren Beaty & Gene Hackman(who wasn't an established actor back in '67)perform their roles exceedingly well. But the one who really steals the show & packs in a superlative punch is Faye Dunnaway. Be it her perfect hillbilly accent, her exudation of a more thrilling lifestyle & better prospects, her emotional recklessness when she craves for her mother or the look in her eyes when her mother predicts her future & when Clyde can't make love to her, she's just mesmerizing, not to mention her seductive, sensuous appeal throughout the film. Another fulfilling aspect of the film are the action scenes. In fact, its the action scenes which provide some real proof of the director's(Arthur Penn)calibre. Especially check out the scene's where the gang escapes from a motel for the second time & when they are surrounded in a field by law enforcement officers.Is the movie worth watching...? Most definitely! Matter of fact, its a good movie to view once. But is it a classic...? Most definitely not! & it definitely doesn't merit a spot on 'IMDb's Top 250 all time movie's list', when more deserving movies('White Heat', 'Angels With Dirty Faces')in the same genre are overlooked.My final rating-6.8/10(6.5, if it wasn't for Faye Dunaway).",Bonnie and Clyde
124,saadanathan,Bonnie and Clyde are pretty dull 6/10,6,3 October 2020,"""Bonnie and Clyde"" tells the tale of two of the most famous robbers in american history. The couple known as ""bonnie and Clyde"" were considered Robin Hood to many civilians during the great depression. Personally I was less impressed by the film and for most of the time it felt dull. Even the main characters are not good enough. For an hour and a half you watch both robbers with their gang robbing banks and killing cops. Not THAT different from other modern crime movies today. The actors are exaggerating with their acting and it feels very fake. The colors throughout the film were nice and the costume design was accurate and good. I don't recommend unless you're not familiar with the story.",Bonnie and Clyde
125,andrewroy-04316,"Bonnie and Clyde is far ahead of its time as an energetic, realistic action film",7,27 May 2020,"Bonnie and Clyde is a good film with a great impact. Violence and antiheroes are commonplace in today's movies, but we see how Bonnie and Clyde pioneered the style. The film presents all the events firmly from their perspective, and understand the rush they feel in the things they do and the way they laugh in the face of the law. It's unafraid to show characters get shot to death and make it look fairly real, which was radical at the time. Both leads are very well acted, but while Clyde is the face and driving force of the operation, it's Bonnie's character that is truly fascinating and elevates the film. Clyde doesn't change too much over the course of the film, as a hard-nosed, theft-first guy. Bonnie, on the other hand, joins the business because it's the first genuinely exciting prospect she's had. She has an intensity and commitment to their work to match Clyde, but she looks to a future beyond this life (even as she knows it can't happen) and is so excited to see her mother. Getting into the psychology of why they do what they do and the toll it takes as they put their group in increasing danger would've made it even more satisfying for me, but as it is it's a great action movie that had a massive influence.",Bonnie and Clyde

You do not want to go messin' with Uncle Jessie!!!!The costumes and cinematography are great, and the soundtrack by Flatt & Scruggs is close to perfect! I'm glad I finally got around to watching this classic!",Bonnie and Clyde
127,Flagrant-Baronessa,"Humanizes, personalizes, romanticizes and entertains",8,12 October 2006,"The aforementioned naturally relegated Bonnie and Clyde to a controversial status when it was released in 1967  and it is still a bold staple in film today, given its content of two hard-boiled killers navigating robberies and murders under the banner of 'love' in the deep necks of the American South during the 1930's Depression. Another reason why it generated so much buzz was because it is such a well-crafted and entertaining film. When Bonnie sees Clyde for the first time outside of her house, stealing her mother's car, she is intrigued. When Clyde tells her that he did time for armed robbery, she is attracted. When Clyde flashes his gun, she is hooked. Director Arthur Penn explicitly makes us see the appeal of Warren Beatty in this blunt opening scene, highlighting the latter's inherent bad-boy-who-can-be-changed appeal that Bonnie falls for. The two set out in stolen cars, traveling through the seedy rural side of Lousiana, Texas, Missouri and Oklahoma  while the raw feel of the depression invests the film is a damp, murky and barren tone. Bonnie and Clyde are in fact both hicks  Bonnie a restless waitress and Clyde a two-time parole. The Great Depression era belonged to the people; it was arguably the first time politicians were placed in the backseat to make room for the people of the nation, catering to their increasingly desperate needs and poor living standards. 'Bonnie and Clyde' mercilessly zooms in on its conditions, thereby acting as social criticism of sorts. Its two titular characters despise bureaucracy and loathe the law. When they pick up two hostages, both of whom tremble with fear over being in the custody of two notorious criminals, Bonnie and Clyde inform them that ""Why would we hurt you? Ya'll are folks, just like us.""While the Southern drawl pleasantly dawdles on throughout the film, so does the sense of impending doom. Realism starts to kick in as members of the ""Barrow gang"" (Bonnie, Clyde, Clyde's brother, his wife and their getaway-driver) suffer conflicts  both external and internal. It ceases being 'fun and games' and snowballs into a killing spree that often culminates in fierce car-chases and hard-boiled showdowns with the cops. How far are they willing to go?They go far. Too far. Thankfully, their last journey is crafted with deft strokes. From the seedy setting, the fantastically layered acting from Faye Dunaway, Warren Beatty and Gene Hackman, the deft wielding of moods in the story to the final culmination  it is all of the utmost quality and it locks you into fast-paced world of Bonnie and Clyde, bravely plunging into their imperfections and passions, fully humanizing them toward the end. The cinematography is plain beautiful, earning an Oscar in this category, especially the scene in which a patient steadicam glides far above a field of dried maize crops in which Bonnie and Clyde become smaller and smaller as the camera zooms out. There is no doubt in my mind that Penn has done something exceptional here and that Bonnie and Clyde is the best film of 1967. 8 out of 10",Bonnie and Clyde
128,SkullScreamerReturns,Action crime road movie of the '60s,7,12 September 2021,"This is a well-known crime film with the characters based on real bank robbers of the '30s. I can't say how faithful it is to the subject material but all I can say it's a pretty action-packed film for being from the '60s. I think I've also read its violence caused controversy and shock at the time. The shock factor that made the movie famous probably doesn't work anymore that much, because you've probably seen more violent films by now. But it's still quite a wild ride.The story moves like a road movie. New characters join the ride every now and then. First the tone is adventurous and fun, but as the police starts to chase our antiheroes it becomes more and more thrilling - and bullets are flying.There is not much plot, just traveling and action. What makes the movie is the acting. Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway make a great pair. Also the other cast is good. Especially Gene Hackman is always a nice addition to any film.Well, how good the movie is? It's exciting, not boring... quite good. But I wouldn't call it a huge personal favorite of mine because...I don't know, I didn't find any major reason why would I love it. But I do recommend seeing it if you haven't.",Bonnie and Clyde

Admittedly, it is competently made, but that is faint praise. Beatty and Dunaway give laughably bad performances (especially with those lame hillbilly accents!) and the work of the rest of the cast couldn't pass muster on The Andy Griffith Show. (And don't get me started on Estelle Parsons' annoying overacting.) More than this is the dubious morality of plucking two utterly obscure petty criminals out of the annals of history and giving them the Hollywood treatment to make them into legendary folk heroes. Critics, here and elsewhere, have bent over backwards trying to read significance into these amoral nobodies and their ugly behavior, which only smells of desperation, not insight. The saddest thing of all is how this film gets praised as a landmark in the depiction of screen violence, as if the glamorizing of violence and brutality is a good thing. This might have been mitigated had the film, at least, featured above average film-making techniques, but I see nothing remarkable or memorable about the stylistics provided by director Arthur Penn (a director who I have always thought to be overrated). Find the soundtrack and enjoy the great music, but don't waste your time with the film.",Bonnie and Clyde
130,TaylorYee94,I feel for Bonnie and Clyde,8,16 September 2020,"When audience falls in love with protagonist villain, that's when to tell the film is a success. People naturally root for hero and good deed, and it takes extra effort for the movie with villain as a protagonist to make audience empathize.The narrative of this movie is kind enough to take time and effort to explain the history of villains, display inner turmoil and confusion, and bring out their charms. Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway's acting is very delicate, and they were able to present Bonnie and Clyde's both wild, charming, sexy and perplexing, lonely, hurt side.The choice of setting well represents the vast wilderness that Barrow Gang move around physically and mentally. I especially love the scene where Clyde runs to find Bonnie in the middle of field of reeds. Then, they collapse and hug in the wide field. The camera changes to bird-eye-view and zooms out. It just accurately represents that they are the only ones left in their world. They have no way out but have to depend only on each other.Bonnie and Clyde came out more than 50 years ago, but it does not feel old except for crude editing. The story flows naturally; the acting is not dramatized; and characters are not one sided but rather dynamic.",Bonnie and Clyde

They way they have them meeting is off!! They met in 1930 & she broke him out before he was nabbed a week later!! I will talk about a couple more Hollywood only things in this. Clyde was a BAR nut and you never see him with one in this!! Also the death scene is completely inaccurate!! They both were killed INSIDE the car, not the way it is shown in this!!
To add more to the inaccuracy of this movie, many lawsuits were filled against the studio for defamation of character by the likes of Frank Hamers wife and kid!!

With not much to lose, Bonnie and Clyde rob banks to combat ennui of the distressed times, become famous, more violent, then legendary, and come off as simple folk unceremoniously ambushed. Faye Dunaway captures the trapped nature of her character but acknowledges her choice while Warren Beaty portrays Clyde as a simple man thinking he was robbing banks, not people. The Gene Hackman and Michael J Pollard characters prove uneducated and hapless while Estelle Parsons comes across like a dumb cluck. Not a sophisticated lot and yet they are a part of American History born out of bad times and desperation for the ""anywhere but here"" syndrome that plays out with a hillbilly soundtrack.The sadness of the American folk is thoroughly felt in this landmark gangster film.",Bonnie and Clyde

There's also a hilarious cameo from Gene Wilder. The story is awesome even though it's not very true the the actual account. And also, this movie has one of the most shocking endings I've ever seen.

134,adrianovasconcelos,Apparently simple film with a complex anti-crime message,10,6 October 2021,"Arthur Penn and Warren Beatty had their finest hour with BONNIE & CLYDE. On the surface an unpretentious and even at times comic rendition of the story of Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, the notorious duo who wrought all kinds of evil and embarrassment for the US police and banks in the Depression, this film actually delivers a very effective anti-crime message.Barrow and Parker come across as a couple trying to flee reality by robbing banks to finance their existence, which is continually limited and diminishing by the authorities that relentlessly hunt them. They would rather avoid violence but kill coppers along the way as an inevitability.High caliber dialogue. Beautiful Dunaway does not waste a line in her highly perceptive performance. She may seek the limelight at a time of extreme poverty and anonimity, but she is no fool. She knows what she is getting into, even if blinded by her attraction for handsome Clyde, whom she catches trying to steal her car and whose impotence she treats with unexpected patience and understanding. She is capable of love, despite shooting to kill. Clyde loves her just as much. He literally cannot live without her. Spiritually, it amounts to a heavenly match - reality, of course, is much harsher: they need money and want to get it without working for a boss. They prefer to grab money from banks, whom they blame for the dire economic situation and rampant removal of property from poor people.Bonnie, as the more intelligent half of the duo, writes a poem predicting their demise. She realizes that the life they have means death in the short term and, before it, a complete inability to so much as enjoy family time. The meeting she and Clyde have with her mother delivers the anti-crime message with a powerful punch. The mother debunks immediately Bonnie's myth about coming to live near her house, warning her that she will be killed in no time and she does not want to see it happen.Still, for someone as impulsive and free-ranging as Bonnie, she is faithful to Clyde and there is an element of genuine devotion and candor in that love, which prevents her leaving him and starting a new life, one of supposedly no problems with the law. She dreams of it, even confides it to him, but she knows that the past cannot be wiped - the simple existence she yearns after at the end of the movie will never happen.As for Clyde, if he had his life over, he would live in one state and rob banks in another. Clearly, he cannot do anything else with his life. He cannot see beyond living committing crimes.He posts positive character traits, too: he loves his brother, treats his sister in law with respect despite her not fitting in with the group, and he feels deeply his brother's death. Perhaps his single best trait is that he determinedly avoids robbing the poor. Still, his childish desire for fame and refusal to earn a legal living ultimately seal his fate.Superlative script, cinematography, production, and acting from the entire cast. Hackman, Parsons, Wilder and Pollard provide superb supporting structure to the leads. 10/10.",Bonnie and Clyde

⚪
This film once again affirmed my opinion that the New Hollywood age is one of the finest eras in the history of cinema and spawned some of the greatest movies I have ever seen. As one of the most influential and essential titles from that epoch, if not the prime example for the values this era represented, it magnificently shows the notorious story of one of the most infamous criminal duo that ever walked the earth. Even if their tale is more romanticised than it was in real life, it superbly depicts how two social outcasts, different in their nature yet similar in their boredom, set out on a bank robbing spree and rebel against a system they deem depraved. What makes this film so tremendously revolutionary for its period is how it broke several taboos with its existence. Aside from almost total nudity and surprisingly graphic brutality, such as the shootouts and headshots in several scenes, the whole movie effectively makes us root for the bad guys of the story, the most well-known group of antiheroes of probably ever. All accusations of glorification of violence put aside, it delivers a packing crime drama that is primarily defined by its charismatic and likeable characters that are anything but exemplary. Behind the charming smile of Clyde Barrow lies a manipulative, wickedly crafty, criminal genius and everyone who joins him in his illegal adventures is automatically doomed from the start. This aspect is also one of the major themes of this film, as it shows in every case that this lifestyle will always end in the worst way. Every companion, his brother included, eventually finds their fate and in the end, he and his beloved die a saddening yet inevitable and justified death. What makes it even more devastating is how they often contemplate about a life without a criminal record throughout and how they want to get out in some way, but reality always hits them and they are aware that this is impossible. This film made me feel things in many ways, and hence I immediately fell in love with it. All in all, this infamous story of two of the most notorious crime duos of all time is a masterfully crafted piece of New Hollywood art that knows to entertain in the typical, unconventional manner. With charismatic, superbly acting lead actors, a well-paced story that quickly recovers from its pacing issues in the beginning, unexpectedly innovative blood effects and violence and fantastic cinematography that marvellously captures dramatic essence of the whole tale, it justifiably bears the title as one of the greatest classic films from the era of ground-breaking cinema and superlatively manifests all the values it stands for, the desperate chase for the American Dream and the shocking bad ending included. It isn't only the story of one of the most disreputable killing couples of all time - it is the story of Bonnie and Clyde.",Bonnie and Clyde

Almost fifty years later I have put that right.What first struck me was what a good looking film it is, rich and lush. A young Warren Beatty is strikingly handsome, Faye Dunaway fabulously beautiful. The countryside, shot in Texas, is an alluring golden hue, a soft focus backdrop to a violent, merciless story.A tale of desperadoes, on the run, robbing and killing as they go, was not new, and has been re-imagined many times since. But the ambivalence of our emotions, played with by two lead characters who are both appealing in demeanour, but brutal in their actions resonates even now.Gene Hackman and Billy Wilder are amongst a strong supporting cast, with dialogue heavy interludes which Tarantino has since honed and developed in his career as a movie maker. Indeed the final shoot-out could easily be from a Tarantino film.Director Arthur Penn ended his career with 27 features to his credit, but before his film career he was vastly experienced in the Playhouse TV series. That grasp of making a scene count is much in evidence here. Apart from Little Big Man, none of his other films scaled the heights that Bonnie and Clyde does. Maybe, having made a pretty much perfect genre piece, the options seemed limited.Nearly half a century later the film still seems fresh despite all that has followed it. The mix of humdrum small town life, youthful dreaming, the excitement of the chase, and the devil of wrong doing are a heady concoction when it works as it does here. Two images endure for me, the bloody, brutal finale, and a youthful chase, boy after girl, through swaying cornfields. They are worthy cyphers for the film as a whole.",Bonnie and Clyde
137,Hermit C-2,(Top 10 choice) Superb job done by all involved.,10,22 April 1999,"Besides being an enormously entertaining movie, ""Bonnie and Clyde"" was an important 1960's landmark film in a couple of ways. Its violent ending helped to hasten the end of the old Hayes code, which had been a severe restrictor of artistic freedom; and it helped shape the '60's image of the anti-hero. For these things it received a good deal of condemnation as well as commendation.The picture is a melange of artistic license and historical accuracy. The recreation of the Depression-era look is superb. (It's done in an unostentatious manner, however. One feels it rather than particularly noting it.) While some liberties are taken with the story, a reasonable amount jibes with the facts. But certainly there is some romanticization here. And of course the real Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker were not nearly as attractive as Beatty and Dunaway.The acting by the two principals is top-notch, as well as that of most of the rest of the cast, especially  Gene Hackman (the first film I ever saw him in) and Estelle Parsons.It's not generally recognized that actors Denver Pyle, Dub Taylor and Gene Wilder contribute to the movie's success. Technically as well as artistically everyone from director Arthur Penn on down deserves praise for making what I think is one of the finest movies ever made, without qualification. It seems we all reserve the warmest spots in our hearts for favorite films of our youth. This is one of mine.And you'll love Flatt & Scruggs' ""Foggy Mountain Breakdown"" too.",Bonnie and Clyde
138,eshwarmail,Fast paced adventure with beautiful Faye Dunaway in the mix amounts to fabulous entertainment,7,3 September 2012,"Iconic: Yes; Influential: May be; Great: I reserve my thoughts on that. True stories based on infamous, controversial and spectacular characters are always hot cakes to sell be it Dillinger, Al Capone or D.B. Cooper. If one could get famous actors into the fold, you got yourself a blockbuster. This one is no different.I would suggest wikipedia for a detailed synopsis as the script sticks to the facts occasionally deviating for dramatic elevations. The mercurial rise and a gut wrenching fall of one of the most talked about real life infamous couple.Faye Dunaway looks a million bucks and this was an apt start to a fantastic career. It is mostly treated as a fairy tale than a gory biography. Though very brief, it was perfectly conveyed about the boring life Bonnie has been leading and how she gets drawn towards bad, danger and adventure that Clyde provides. Some action scenes in the movie are cartoonish (may be intentional) but the gory climax might leave you spellbound.Fast paced adventure with beautiful Faye Dunaway in the mix amounts to fabulous entertainment.",Bonnie and Clyde
139,werefox08,Penn Writes A New Chapter............About Blood & Robbers,10,15 May 2013,"Bonnie and Clyde was made in 1967. It was Directed by Arthur Penn...this was only his 5th movie. Penn delivers a magnificent motion picture, that is still great to watch...to-day. Warren Beatie and ..newcomer..Faye Dunawaye as the two 1930s unconventional robbers are ""very loosely based"" on the real Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow. It doesn't really matter...how completely different the characters were, or how changed the story is. What is important is the pure class of this wild and bloody adventure. This a great movie for every reason you can think of...that makes a great movie. Strangely...when it was released it was heavily criticized (even those ""intellegent critics"" who right little stories about film were lost.) After it did take off (word of mouth is stronger than critical non-sense) it soared into the consciousnesses of those who ever wondered what American law was like in the Depression era. And those who were curious about human existence. A fabulous 10 star Classic.",Bonnie and Clyde
140,williampsamuel,A Slick and Stylish Landmark in American Cinema,10,6 December 2014,"If Arthur Penn's seminal Bonnie and Clyde has a moral, it's that there are few things more dangerous than bored young people with big ambition and no prospects. Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty) and Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway) were two such young people in the 1930's, who robbed banks and gunned down lawmen largely because they had nothing better to do. Joined by Clyde's brother Buck (Gene Hackman), his high-strung wife Blanche, and their bumbling getaway man CW Moss, they cut a swath across the Midwest and became the most notorious outlaws since Jesse James before meeting their end in a hail of bullets.The oddest yet most alluring thing about the gang (at least as portrayed here) is despite the numerous felonies they commit, they don't seem like bad people. They come across less as hardened killers than awkward young lovers who wanted fame, fortune, and excitement, and decided the only way to find them was to go outside the law. At first, they succeed almost in spite of themselves, making rookie mistakes like robbing a recently failed bank. Even when they hit their stride, the satisfaction of a successful stick-up is eclipsed by the excitement of reading about their exploits in the paper and in becoming household names.And despite the rapid body count they amass, they never seem to relish the violence. They don't mind firing a few shots into the air, just to scare folks, but they don't shoot anyone unless they have to. For them, shootouts are an unwelcome danger that gets in the way of their real business, and killing someone is only further reason for the law to track them down, and maybe something to feel guilty over. After a struggle in grocery store results in serious injury to the proprietor, Clyde complains to Bonny ""Why did he have to go and do that? Ain't got nothing against him.""Together with the rest of the gang, they're almost like a big, thieving, murdering family. They have their fights and falling outs, and they make up. They get homesick. They have their personality clashes, with Bonnie and Blanche barely tolerating each other. Between Blanche's excitability, Buck's hick ways and corny jokes, and CW's good natured idiocy, much of the film has a cheery, even humorous feel. Nowhere is this truer than during the shootout in Joplin. Bullets are flying everywhere and cops are dropping left and right, but the sight of Blanche running across the yard waving her arms, screaming her lungs out, and generally making a complete fool of herself renders the scene absolutely hilarious. But despite the not infrequent comic relief, Bonnie and Clyde is no lighthearted comedy. They are wanted men and women, and danger is never far from them. In reflective moments, Clyde and Bonnie readily admit that they'll someday go out in a hail of bullets- people in their line of work don't tend to have long and happy lives. And throughout the final reel, it becomes clear that the end is drawing closer. As the number of lawmen on their trail increases, the shootouts become bigger and bloodier, the escapes become ever narrower, and their luck begins to fail, until finally the young lovers meet their destiny on a quiet country back road.These scenes, especially the latter, were larger, far bloodier, and more realistic than any put on film up to that point. Up until then, most movie violence had been largely bloodless, with actors merely grimacing or slumping over when shot, and the more horrific violence merely being implied. But Bonnie and Clyde dared to show what really happens when lead meets flesh. The now famous death scene shocked audiences upon the film's release in 1967, and is still powerful more than forty years later. It's no understatement to say that Bonnie and Clyde paved the way for nearly every modern shoot-em-up, from The Wild Bunch to Scarface.Perhaps what really makes Bonnie and Clyde special is that although it had the subject, and the budget, of a quickie exploitation film, Penn treated the material with nuance and style, giving us real people with hopes, dreams, and emotions of their own, and making graphic violence and human sexuality worthy of high cinema. With powerful performances by Beatty and Dunaway, groundbreaking effects work, and its then unique mix of gun play, humor, and personal drama, Bonnie and Clyde did more than any sensationalist headline to create the mystique that surrounds its protagonist to this day, and heralded the arrival of new wave cinema to the US. This was, and is, one of the great American movies.",Bonnie and Clyde
141,darkreignn,A crime film that needed more romance to fully succeed,7,1 March 2021,"Starring the absolutely beautiful Faye Dunaway alongside the ever charming and charismatic Warren Beatty, ""Bonnie and Clyde"" tells the true, albeit romanticized, story of real-life thieves and murderers Bonnie and Clyde. A bloody, romantic retelling, ""Bonnie and Clyde"" succeeds in portraying two likeable criminals, but in my opinion fails in threading the proper emotion needed to make the inevitable violent conclusion impactful.Chances are that you're familiar with the story of Bonnie and Clyde - two criminals fall wildly in love and go on a crime spree, gunning down anyone in their path without remorse or mercy. The 1967 portrayal of this story does, in a way, follow that same formula. Faye Dunaway (who is just incredibly gorgeous in this film, oozing sex appeal) plays Bonnie, and falls in love with Warren Beatty's Clyde, and together they rob banks and assemble a gang of ruthless criminals as they fight the law, as well as anyone else who crosses them. It's a good story, but would've been even better if the romance between Bonnie and Clyde was better developed.Their romance and fall for one another seemed to happen instantaneously, with barely any build up or emotion behind it. And while this may be true to life, as stories say they really did fall in love at first sight, the movie would've greatly benefited from a slower burn so the audience could've felt the budding romance and connected deeper with the characters. Instead, we get a man and a woman who are instantly smitten with one another, both of them immediately enticed and willing to enter into a life of crime. It's almost fantasy-like in portrayal, which makes sense given the romanticization of the subject matter, but it really does the movie no favors in terms of character development and audience empathization.That said, because Faye and Warren are so charming and likeable in their roles, you won't be able to help but like both Bonnie and Clyde, rooting for them as they go along their spree of terror. And make no mistake, their crime spree is horrific, as they drop bodies left and right, barely hesitating to put anyone to the sword. The scenes of bloody violence are an effective contrast to the scenes of romance and comedy, serving as a reminder to the audience that, yes, these people are criminals and deserve what's coming to them. For a film made in 1967, the action sequences are particularly brutal and effective, never shying away from blood and gore that lets the audience view the horrific consequences of violence.I did enjoy ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" but would've enjoyed it much more if the relationship between the titular characters would've been explored in more detail. That said, there are many beautiful scenes between the two, and the dichotomy between romance and violence made for a very entertaining viewing experience that I can definitely recommend to fans of romance and true-crime alike.",Bonnie and Clyde

It doesn't get more simple than that, and for the most part, that's how I found this film. Pretty simple, but entertaining, and that ending. It shocked even me, someone who's currently replaying Doom Eternal, so if I were someone in 1967 who'd likely never even seen blood in a film before, I can definitely see how this was as influential as it was.Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway are both amazing, it's pretty well directed and shot, and although there's certainly a few scenes that grind the pace to a halt, and I can't exactly say I find any of the side characters interesting whatsoever, the fact that it's still worth watching today when god knows how many more gangster films have come out since it is really the best testament to its influence possible.",Bonnie and Clyde

The cinematography won an Oscar and deservedly so. The film is not a 10 because, after a bank robbery, the gang makes a getaway in a 29 Durant and are almost hit by a 1940 Ford fire engine.

144,daoldiges,Take It For What It Is Already,7,1 February 2021,"Glancing at the other reviews there are those that hate this film because it got some (or mabye a lot) of the facts wrong - to those I say it's not a documentary but a fictionalized, theatrical representation of B&C, so get over it. The other group loves it because of it's artistic contributions on the overall timeline of Hollywood film development, which I do recognize and appreciate, but will not be taking that into account here.I'm seeing this for the first time here in 2021 and I think it's my first Dunaway film, and I gotta say I like her here and think she did a fine job. Beatty crafts a very likable Clyde. Together their relationship is interesting and touching for the obviously very deep feelings they developed for one another, even though there was no traditional physical connection. They're not smooth criminals here but two kids trying to figure things out as they go. The Gene Hackman and Estelle Parsons characters are needed for the story but it seemed like Hackman didn't bring the depth of character he would do so admirably in many of his subsequent films. While Parsons won the Oscar for her performance, I too found her character a bit grating, but I guess that was the intent. Overall, I found B&C entertaining and worth a viewing.",Bonnie and Clyde

146,Ziya90,A mild and rather romantic adventure than a stunning and impressive crime story about the famous couple,4,15 April 2010,"Generally, ''lovers on the run movies'' are also road movies and Bonnie and Clyde is one of them too. I love road movies and find ''lovers on the run'' movies interesting personally, but unfortunately there are not a lot of real good examples that I would highly recommend to you. As for Bonnie and Clyde, it is a mild and rather romantic adventure of the famous couple or let's say killer lovers. The problem of Bonnie and Clyde like Terence Malick's Badlands is that there is nothing impressive or stunning throughout, but both movies are seen as masterpiece by many audiences and also critics and I have never known why? There are great actors, Warren Betty, Gene Hackman and Faye Dunaway (despite personally I find her a bit dull) The cinematography is OK, but the movie is not well executed or has something impressive, the script has some problems, not a great look into their life and the movie is pretty uninteresting at times. Bonnie and Clyde makes me remember also Natural Born Killers which was very, very intense, but almost awful, because it has another kind of problem, it supposes itself as a criticism of some values, but it tends to be at the side of the killers, it shows the killers as a sort of anti hero which is wrong. In other words, may be it does not glorify the killers exactly, but Stone does not approach the story like an (objective) observer. Additionally, Bonnie and Clyde does not focus on the robberies that the couple did. Thus, what we encounter is not an exciting, thrilling and stunning crime movie. The gunfight part was memorable and only the final was effective, the concept has been imitated by other movies based on such a concept several times.",Bonnie and Clyde
147,shepardjessica,Simply the Best!,10,17 July 2004,"I saw this on it's release in '67 and from then on I was hooked on films for real.  This is my favorite (out of 5800 films) and there's not a weakness in it.  Warren Beatty found his perfect role as the bumbling hayseed none-too-bright small-timer hooking up with the fresh and bored and beautiful Faye Dunaway.  Michael J. Pollard created a completely new type of side-kick (loyal, ignorant, and bored).  Gene Hackman has Clyde's lovable older brother, and Estelle Parsons as his shrewish and exasperated bride were excellent.  Arthur Penn's ballad of love on the run and infamy is a masterpiece of subtlety AND violence!  Beautiful cinematography, a sweeping script by Benton and Newman and location filming that was incredible.  The final scene vaults this into a new realm of story-telling.  A 10 out of 10.  Best performance = Gene Hackman.  Anybody who doesn't get into this film is an idiot or worse.  It certainly doesn't condone any kind of violence.  It's a lucky thing for the New York Times that this film brought Bosley Crowther to his knees and retirement!  Pauline Kael pretty much launched her great career defending this film while many slacker critics bashed it on first release.  2 wins out of 10 at the Oscars (shameful).  Oh well, it's now considered a classic as it should be.  There are no weak performances and Gene Wilder in his film debut is comic perfection.  Denver Pyle plays a worthy adversary and Dub Taylor is homespun greed personified.  Brilliant all the way down the line!",Bonnie and Clyde
148,erwan_ticheler,Interesting but not a true classic,8,19 June 2004,"SPOILERS!:Although Arthur Penn shows some huge talent here,""Bonnie and Clyde"" wasn't the classic that I hoped it would be.Sure it is a classic in the books of Maltin and Kael but those people seem to look just at the historical interest of the movie(which is very obvious) but don't seem to look at the overall quality.Don't get me wrong,""Bonnie and Clyde"" is a very good movie with a great uncompromising climax.Gene Hackman steals the show with a superb performance as usual.Faye Dunaway is stunningly pretty and also very convincing as the innocent girl who becomes a cold criminal.There is a very funy role for Gene Wilder(unknown at the time and only his second role) as an undertaker.There is Estelle Parsons as the annoying wife of Gene Hackman,why she got an oscar is a complete mystery to me. Warren Beatty is the leading man Clyde,but I'm not such a fan of his work.Still,not a bad role.The photography is great and deserved the oscar it got.The music is funny and fitting. But...something seems to miss,it just isn't as good as a lot of other violent movies of the late 60's,the best being ""The Wild Bunch"" by ""Bloody"" Sam Peckinpah.That movie is even more raw and radical than this one,but I have to say that Penn started it off probably in the USA.The ending like I said is the best part of the movie.Although it ends just like that,the final massacre of Bonnie and Clyde is very well done and necessary.They just can't live on in this society of America. There is by the way some criticism on the newspapers and the media in general in the movie,or maybe that's just what I got out of it.Anyway, a very good movie but not as good as it could have been. 8/10",Bonnie and Clyde
149,MF210,Undeniably Great,9,7 September 2003,"My Rating: ***3/4 out of ****. When I saw Bonnie and Clyde I knew it was a great movie. When I saw it for the second time, I saw some stuff I missed and had an even more elevated opinion of the film. Bonnie and Clyde is probably one of the 5 best movies to come out of the 60s. I am not familiar with Director Arthur Penn's work but he gets impressives performances from all of the cast, there is not a weak performance in this movie. Faye Dunaway is fantastic in the role that made her a star. Warren Beatty is also top notch, in what is said to be his best performance, or at least one of them. Gene Hackman is also great in a much earlier role. Estelle Parsons is excellent. The rest of the cast is strong. Gene Wilder has a brief but memorable part.Bonnie and Clyde also has a brilliantly written script. Beautiful Cinematography lights up the movie. It has one of the bloodiest but also unforgettable endings. Bonnie and Clyde is just a great movie, and I cant believe what movies are ahead of it on the top 250 list.
Bonnie and Clyde is a violent movie, but its not gratuitous. The ending is meant to be violent. They were on the run for so long, the police were annoyed with them and had a burning desire to take them down. The ending wouldnt be as tragic if it werent violent.",Bonnie and Clyde
150,Gideon24,A Classic,9,7 March 2015,"After spending a few years as a Hollywood pretty boy, Warren Beatty took control of his career and defined himself as a filmmaker to be reckoned with as the Executive Producer and star of Bonnie and Clyde, a vivid and blistering, if somewhat glamorized look at the infamous bank robbing duo, the formation of their gang, and their rise to being the most wanted outlaws of the 1930's.Beatty, director Arthur Penn, and screenwriters David Newman and Robert Benton have taken the basic story of some real-life criminals and ushered in a new generation of in-your-face film making that redefined the art of cinematic storytelling as well as the presentation of cinematic violence that seemed to stem from the works of directors like Sam Peckinpah and had to be a major influence on people like Scorcese, Coppola, De Palma, and Tarantino.Beatty gives a nicely controlled performance as Clyde Barrow, one of cinema's premiere anti-heroes who Beatty chose not to make a superhero by inflicting his hero with several very human characteristics, some of which that weren't discussed out loud in 1967, mainly his impotence, which is implied in his problematic relationship with Bonnie Parker, beautifully realized by Faye Dunaway, in a star-making performance, whose attraction to Barrow physically as well as his lifestyle is in direct conflict with the real relationship she wants to have with Clyde but never will. There is a school of thought that Barrow was actually gay, but I guess 1967 film audiences weren't ready for that yet. It doesn't change the fact that Beatty and Dunaway create mad chemistry here that burns a hole through the movie screen.They are well-supported by Gene Hackman as Clyde's brother, Buck, Estelle Parsons as Buck's wife, and Michael J Pollard as CW Moss, the gang's wide-eyed young driver.This masterpiece was nominated for 10 Academy Awards and was one of the few films in history to receive nominations in all four acting categories. Beatty, Dunaway, Hackman, Parsons, and Pollard all received nominations and Parsons walked away with the award for Best Supporting Actress. Mention should also be made of an early appearance by a very young Gene Wilder as a reluctant temporary passenger/hostage of the gang.Penn's powerhouse directorial hand is also in full force here, especially in the bloody and brilliant finale that redefined cinematic violence forever. A classic that ushered in a new generation of filmmakers and was the beginning of an entire new phase of the career of Warren Beatty, who proved he was not just a pretty face.",Bonnie and Clyde

Bonnie Parker was not blond nor did she wear a 60's hairstyle. Warren Beatty played Clyde Barrow as a simpleton living off his smile. Bonnie and Clyde were not heroic figures as they killed a number of people while robbing stores and gas stations rather than banks. I give this rating because it's a classic and not for the actual quality of the film. Another factoid that is real but ludicrous today is how they were gunned down in cold blood by numerous police from various agencies. That happened and even though they publicly declared they would go down shooting, we would still have a really hard time accepting that kind of police work today. Let's all be thankful they don't do that anymore.",Bonnie and Clyde

Based on real life.Bonnie and Clyde is a violent film, although by today's standards it may seem fairly tame. The film is quite realistic, although viewers steeped in modern (and generally completely unrealistic) CGI may think quite the opposite. Ask your local trauma surgeon for her opinion. The film presents us with a sexually dysfunctional antihero, a topic only to be found in Indie films these days.B&C belongs to a series of movies that continued with ""Clockwork Orange"" and more recently ""Natural Born Killers."" Movies that almost (or perhaps fully?) make us root for violent criminals, exposing how thin the veneer of civil life really is. As one might expect, anything that NBK does is done in more subtle ways in B&C, although it may not have seemed so to moviegoers of the mid-sixties. Where Bonnie gets a dainty little poem about her life of crime published in the newspapers, Mickey of NBK gets his own media crew worshiping him. Where Clyde kills by accident at first, Mickey mass-murders. The twist of irony is deeper in B&C though: Clyde can fire off a gun, but he can't fire from the hip, and when he finally does, the guns quickly turn on him. All the characters talk explicitly about how they are good Christians, but unbridled passion will not go unpunished. And Bonnie's poem is as real as the real Bonnie and Clyde, although 100s of years from now their existence will undoubtedly be doubted, as is now the existence of Shakespeare in some quarters.Enough comparison, though. Bonnie and Clyde is the granddaddy of hyperviolent movies, and like all granddaddies must be given credit, even if the envelope was pushed more later on. It's also quite humorous, and it pays to follow the faces of different individual characters in crowded scenes when seeing it again. The southern accents are priceless. The acting is stellar, from an innocent Beatty to a jolly Hackman, a sultry Dunaway to an awe-struck Pollard. Gene Wilder has a cameo, before he became famous in ""The Producers"" and all those Mel Brooks films. Director Arthur Penn had a brilliant eye for humor. The strange thing is that the actors later became so iconic for what they do in this movie, it is almost incongruent with our hindsight: Wait, Gene Wilder playing in this movie, I didn't think it was THAT kind of comedy...Enjoy the film as a good 1930s period romp, and always remember: if you think it's too tame, or not enough this or that, when most of the films that we think are so great right now are totally dated and forgotten, this one is still going to be a violent, and realistic, and funny period piece.",Bonnie and Clyde

Rather than showing the two as brutal murderers, the film focuses more on the romance that blossoms between the two.What the film does very well is dragging you along for an exciting ride with Bonnie and Clyde. Not in an viewing aspect but rather as if you are actually sitting in the car with them. The characters are engaging and the ride is filled with fun killing and heart pumping bank robberies. It all extremely fun, especially when doing it with the infamous Bonnie and Clyde. it sure sounds like if i enjoyed watching innocent civilians being murdered by the pair but that only because the film forces you too. You don't see it through the eyes of the civilians, instead you see everything through the eyes of the killers which makes for an roller coaster joy ride. This is no dark film , but rather an adventure.Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty are brilliant as the romantic couple. The film doesn't show they both as cold blooded killers but focuses more on there romance. There nothing mentally wrong with them in fact Bonnie is quite innocent who gets caught up with the wrong man.Don't expect an dark criminal film that filled with outrages murders.

156,Nate-48,"An American standard, must watch movie",8,10 February 2019,"This movie's importance is that it is the first film since the pre code era to show a lot of blood during and after a shooting. The violence escalates into a finale that was as shocking at the time as it is powerful today. The fact that it's based on a true story gives it further weight. But the true genius of this film is the acting between Warren Beatty and four great actors who all make sensational debuts here: Faye Dunaway (who nearly carries the movie), Gene Hackman (who steals the show when he arrives), the late Michael Pollard (who won an Academy Award for his performance) and Gene Wilder (who acts like he just arrived from another planet).
Some of the stuff is a little dated and doesn't hold up because it's not so smooth. There are a few scenes that could have been edited better and leave you scratching your head.

An absolutely pitch-perfect combination of thrills, violence, and social commentary, the film is also surprisingly heartfelt and full of unexpected humor. Extremely daring for the time, not only for it's unrelenting nature of it's graphic violence, but also for it's progressively unbiased slant - Penn and Beatty ignore the dichotomous nature of most Hollywood films - they never judge nor condone the behavior of their subjects, but simply examine them as three-dimensional human beings.The casting is flawless. This will sound like a silly statement from a publicist, but Beatty and Faye Dunaway are so much more than just beautiful individuals - they are true artists whom throw themselves into their work with reckless abandon. The Oscar-nominated star duo portrays the titular characters with such genuineness and authority that they have actually become Bonnie and Clyde to many film-goers around the world. And the supporting cast is equally top-notch, including first-rate work from Michael J. Pollard, Gene Hackman, Estelle Parsons (who won an Oscar for her hilariously shrill performance), and even a young Gene Wilder in a brief comedic bit.The film was nominated for 10 Oscars in categories across the board, and won two. Although critical reaction was initially mixed upon the film's original release, the film is now highly regarded as a bonafide American film classic. Audiences responded immediately to the film, and the picture became the fourth highest-grosser of 1967. This film almost single-handedly (along with THE GRADUATE) revolutionized Hollywood and ushered in a whole new era of film-making. Its importance and influence cannot be underestimated.",Bonnie and Clyde
159,StevenKeys,Bonnie and Clyde,10,4 March 2020,"From the innovative opening titles, a series of period photographs with shutter-sound (Fitzgerald-Stahl), through a sequence of short scenes, the first in Bonnie's bedroom (Guffey), proving sensuality does not require nudity, then catching Clyde in the act (theft) (""Hey, boy!""), her escape, their stroll, the dare, first heist, the getaway, rejection and the pact, the viewer will know from get-go that this is not your typical gangster flick. Much more than ""rat-a-tat-tat,"" this bullet-noir is the one that broke the mold.In the post-War world, much was changing, and if it hadn't, it would soon. Industry Codes that had put a stop to lively dialogue and lovely necklines (30s), punished politics (50s blacklist) and yet forced creators to master the art of subtlety & suggestion, were, by the late 60s, merely paper pronouncements. As freedom reigned, realism became the ticket (The-Set-Up All-About-Eve Twelve-OClock-High On-The-Waterfront). B&C didn't start the trend but gave those Codes a final, firm push over the edge.In production, Beatty picked a true story already romanticized, finally found a director (Penn), by chance cast the perfect co-star in Faye Dunaway (Natalie Wood rejected the part) and tabbed strong support in Hackman, Parsons, Pollard and Pyle as the dogged Texas Ranger. Taboos are handled skillfully. The sex topic is curious, honest and the one act of passion is sensitive, while the violence is not gratuitous but purposeful and poignant as the executing officers in the famous closing scene (a shocker in 67, powerful today) stand in dazed disallusionment, gazing on the bloody result.Leads Beatty & Dunaway are superb, securing themselves places alongside movie icons Gable & Leigh, surprisingly a sore spot for Oscar planners who, for the 50th anniversary (17), seemed to set-up both for a fall by inexplicably handing Warren & Faye the wrong envelope. One of the films that triggers the age-old query, do portrayals of bad acts (murder greed racism) and unpleasant depictions (servility crudeness) encourage the same? Who can say? What I can say is this: Welcome to democracy, a healthy one promoting art, choice and debate. Ahh, what boredom has wrought (4/4).",Bonnie and Clyde

For the most part, I found this one's story (as well as its title characters) to be pretty dull stuff, in the long run.It sure seemed to me that noted film-maker, Arthur Penn, couldn't make up his mind whether he was directing a dead-serious crime-drama, or a silly, empty-headed, little slapstick comedy.But, either way, this picture didn't have enough going for it, in whatever genre, to hold my undivided attention for more than but a few minutes at a time.And, what really began to grate on my nerves in this story was all of the thwarted attempts at sex that took place between the Bonnie and Clyde characters. Man, the sniveling soap opera that went on between these 2 gloating, bickering, gun-crazy airheads was enough to make this dissatisfied viewer start to press the fast-forward button on his handset more often than he really should have.",Bonnie and Clyde
161,blazesnakes9,At a time when movies meant something,10,22 August 2014,"Taglined, ""They're young... they're in love...and they kill people."", Bonnie and Clyde blew open the theater doors of America when it was first released in 1967. It is, without a doubt, the best American film I've seen in a long time. When the movie first begins with sepia tone photographs of the real Bonnie and Clyde and also the Barrow gang, I knew that I was in the hands of a great filmmaker.Faye Dunaway plays Bonnie Parker. Warren Beatty plays Clyde Barrow. The year is 1930. When we first meet the two, Clyde tries to steal an nearby car that is parked near Bonnie's house. Looking out the window, Bonnie notices the stranger and set her eyes on the young man while staring at him out the window of her home. At first, their relationship starts to develops slowly as we learned that Bonnie works as a waitress in Texas. But the thing is, she doesn't know Clyde's line of work. After witnessing Clyde holds up an general store in town, the two decides to go on the run.Buck Barrow, (Gene Hackman), and his wife, Blanche, (Estelle Parsons), soon catch up with the two lovers and after several hold-ups and robberies, they start to make a name of themselves. They were the Barrow gang. Clyde was the leader. But even though they thought that knocking off banks were their specialty, the law followed after them, trying to catch them. The law couldn't catch these two even if they were cornered by them. As time goes on however, the two lovers/killers realize that their joyride will soon be over before they know it. They can sense it. They don't when their day will come. But, it will happened.When first released in 1967, the movie was met with an uproar of controversy when film critics and even movie audiences said that the movie glamorized the couple. Well, I agree to this statement. The movie romanticized their account on what they did during the great Depression. What I saw was basically, two juvenile delinquents trying outrun the law and without giving away the ending, the message soon becomes clear. For a while, the two outlaws were rebels as portrayed in the movie. Similar to other movies like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Wild Bunch, Bonnie and Clyde tells us an true American story rather than telling us a routine story about two outlaws on the run. It's more than that. The movie does a great job of showing us what violence can do to individuals. It has a very strong moral argument to tell us.The one thing that did hit me was the beautiful cinematography by Burnett Guffey, who won a Oscar for his photography for this movie. There are a lot of beautiful shots of a wheat field where Bonnie runs around in and another fabulous scene where Bonnie meets her mother and her family. The way that scene is shot shows a dream-like sequence where pure innocence can be lost completely. Director Arthur Penn illustrates a time where people could do whatever they, but were still part of the American system. That kind of representation is really fascinating because during the 1960's, that kind of freedom was cut short by the ongoing Vietnam War. Some critics and movie-goers might think that Bonnie and Clyde is an allegory on the Vietnam War. I have high doubts about that symbolism, but it's true to other movies that came after this one.Beatty, Dunaway Hackman and especially Estelle Parsons are absolutely amazing in this movie. Their star power is very important and top-notch. Not only because they played believable characters, but they are so fragile in this movie. The fact that they know that their joyride will soon end is something remarkable. It is truly great to see actors playing characters that we care about even though they were criminals. In fact, that's why Bonnie and Clyde works so well. The fact that these characters are so true and young that it's appeal to the audience is something that captures all of us in the movies. Think about it. What would happened if Beatty wasn't Clyde Barrow? What would happened if Dunaway wasn't Bonnie Parker? Without those performers, this movie would not have been made without the direction, the cinematography and the actors themselves.After seeing Bonnie and Clyde, I started to say to myself that the tail- end of the 60's were very important to American cinema at that time. Movies like this one, and also Blow-Up, The Wild Bunch, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Persona are one of the reason movies said something about us. They can be controversial at first, but the powerful impact of what movies can do do people is something special. It's a shame to say that today's movies are basically niche and contrived with plot devices, predictable endings, weak writing and overstuffed acting. If you were to take out all of today's movies and replaced with movies from the 50's, 60's, 70's and the 1980's, you would definitely see a major contradiction. Many people today would not go to see these movies if it wasn't for the makers. Over time, Bonnie and Clyde continues to shock audiences with it's portrayal of on-screen violence and glamorized crime matter. But even to an artistic point of view, this movie can be studied for its craftsmanship. It's beautifully told through picturesque photography of the Midwest and its message is one that should be talk about. An amazing piece of vivid movie-making. ★★★★ 4 stars.",Bonnie and Clyde
162,Filmdokter,A defining film of New Hollywood,7,5 February 2021,"Although the highly romanticized story of Bonnie and Clyde takes place in the 1930's, it really is a story about the youth of the 60's. With themes like anti-authorities, rebelliousness and youth it really is a timeless story. It still is a strong picture, and the final scene still has the same impact as it had al those years ago, but Bonnie and Clyde was a real game-changer when it was released. It signaled the birth of New Hollywood and the filmauteur of the sixties and seventies. It's graphic violence was never seen before and much copied afterwards.

Just OK Film.,7,14 June 2021,"An OK film based on real characters, but after 30 minutes it just felt dull.Beatty and Dunaway are fine actors, but they weren't the right ones for these roles.They're both too ""pretty"" for these characters, but since Beatty was the producer ....
yes, Hollowood loves to fondle itself, doesn't it?STORY: This story has been told, and there's little nuance here. So it's delivery
here became monotonous (for me).ACTING: The acting is fine, but just too prescribed, predictable. Again, this feels
more like rich kids ""acting bad"" - not a true-to-form gritty couple.TEMPO: The pace was fine for its purpose, though it felt a bit choppy in execution.CINEMATOGRAPHY: The scenery was actually quite nice, and the era realism was
excellent. I suppose if you have a large enough budget, you could rebuild the ""Titanic"" ; )DIRECTING: The same director (Penn) did ""The Miracle Worker"" and ""The Train"" (Burt Lancaster),
so he's got a solid resume. He also did a lot of made-for-TV drivel before and after, which isn't
necessarily bad, but makes me pause. Incidentally the film ""The Train"" (1964) was actually quite
good - I recommend it as a good WWII suspense / French resistance film. Quite entertaining.Anyhow, ""Bonnie and Clyde"" is an OK film for a little fun if you like the actors AND you don't
overthink it too much (my nemesis). Rating = 7.5.",Bonnie and Clyde
164,stefstars,It's a Classic,7,18 February 2020,"As a lot of other reviewers say, the film romanticizes the crime fueled relationship of Bonnie and Clyde. The ""ride or die"" element of their relationship is really played out throughout the film, to the point that the actual crimes they committed are very ""yadda-yadda'd."" However, that shouldn't take away from it's strengths as a film. The film just throws you into their relationship, at least the beginning of their notorious crime spree. Faye Dunaway is so expressive and gorgeous in the film, you can see why hers and Warren Beatty's incarnations of the couple became 60's fashion icons. Faye's take on Bonnie is done very well, it matches what's been written about the real life Bonnie Parker and how she behaved in real life - a much better performance than the previous cinema treatment Bonnie was given in the 50's. Everyone in the film does a great job with their roles. I'm not sure how to compare Beatty's performance to what the real Clyde was like. His acting is great, but I'm not sure how accurate it is to the real life Clyde Barrow. The writing is great, they talk to each other like actual people do, again compared to the 50's film - this is such a relief. Cinematographic wise, this film is visually pleasing. The shots really feel like they're out of that time period but also have that very 60's touch to them at the same time. Each scene really has that dusty, southern aesthetic - I suppose you could say they chose the right filters which really help illustrate the story and create an almost nostalgic mood. All in all, the film takes some liberties here and there, so as to give their story the proper Hollywood romance treatment - but also to avoid lawsuits (i.e: the name changes.)It's definitely a classic and worth a watch. It's a film of it's time, so it's best to keep that in mind.",Bonnie and Clyde

166,glenn-aylett,Brutal but fairly true to the real life Bonnie and Clyde,9,2 January 2021,"I watched Bonnie and Clyde for the first time since the nineties and for a film made in 1967, when Hollywood was just embracing the permissive society, the level of violence is enormous for a sixties film and on a par with a war film. Yet this is how Bonnie and Clyde were, a pair of extremely violent bank robbers who graduated from holding up small stores to attacking banks and killing anyone who got in their way. ( In real life they killed 13 people, four of them people who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, rather than police). While you sympathise with them at first, Clyde is a prisoner who had a terrible time in prison and Clyde is someone who wants a better life, they soon descend into a pair of callous killers, aided by Clyde's wannabe brother and a simple minded mechanic who fixes their stolen vehicels.I think Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway took the roles well and portray the couple as a pair of twisted lovers who are united in crime, and Gene Hackman plays the role of Buck Barrow quite well, as someone who is a thrillseeker with a hatred of the system. Also look out for Denver Pyle, later best known as Uncle Jessie in The Dukes of Hazzard, as a Texas Ranger who is humiliated by the gang and is determined to catch them. Also the end scene, reasonably true to real events, where Bonnie and Clyde are ambushed and shot to pieces while gazing into each others eyes is chilling and a brilliant ending.On the whole a great film that really established Faye Dunaway as a major stat and the cars, clothes and music are very accurate for the 1930s.",Bonnie and Clyde
167,Chuck-149,1967's best movie.,10,10 September 1999,"""Bonnie and Clyde"" is, what I would consider to be, the movie that let loose violence in cinema.  Artur Penn's based on a true story classic of violence, sexuality, and crime, was excellent thirty-two years ago when it first came out, is excellent today, and will be excellent for decades to come.  Plus, it is one of those rare movies that are at the same time a landmark for cinema history as well as a true classic for more than just its landmark aspect.  This movie earned five nominations only for acting and won best supporting-actress for Estelle Parsons.  One morning, as she wakes up, Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway) notices that a man is trying to subtly break into her car.  She quickly dresses up and runs down.  The man looks up at her embarrassed and we are than revealed Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty).  The two of them go for a walk down the road but when Clyde tells Bonnie that he is a robber, she doesn't believe him. So, he decides to prove to her that he isn't lying and robs a small grocery shop right away.  As soon as he exits the store, he shows Bonnie the money and they escape in a car that they steal.  And so begins an adventure they will never forget.  Along their way, they pick up a young boy who works at a gas station who is called C.W. (Michael J. Pollard).  They begin doing more and more robberies until Clyde is finally forced to kill someone.  Later on in their trip, Clyde's brother (Gene Hackman) and his wife Blanche (Estelle Parsons) catch up with Clyde, C.W., and Bonnie and they continue committing crimes such as robberies and even sometimes murders but usually in cases of self-defense.  ""Bonnie and Clyde"" is beautifully acted and expertly directed. After ""Bonnie and Clyde"", Arthur Penn directed some other good movies such as ""Little big man"" but as good as they were all, none ever equalled ""Bonnie and Clyde"".

169,stebird,True to life and full of excitement,10,8 August 2017,"Who says older films can't be absolutely amazing?The age old story of Bonnie and Clyde, heard many different times in many different ways, but this film version is as true to life as any you'll find, sure it's tarted up for screen presence, but isn't everything?What I really liked about the film is is jumps straight into the action, there's very little backstory, only detailed briefly, Clyde Barrow meets Bonnie Parker at the start of the film and away we go. The whole film draws on some of the notorious duos most celebrated capers, piecing together the story from when they first met, to the moment they are shot dead by the police. Faye Dunaway, in her first major role, electrifies as the somewhat erotic Bonnie Parker, she's a villain you just can't bring yourself to hate, she's pretty, she's charming, she has some serious sex appeal..., and as for Warren Beatty, his portrayal of Clyde Barrow is as realistic as it gets, a charming swindler that will melt you with a grin as much as he'll shoot you with a gun.The supporting cast were somewhat passive, but that doesn't matter, as all eyes are on the titular duo..., the Barrow gang as they were called were cool before cool was a thing, could you really call them villains? To me I'm more inclined to consider them anti-heroes; Bonnie and Clyde was one of the first films in my opinion to usher in the New Hollywood era.Things were changing around the mid-late 60's, gone was the Hayes Code, the Golden era had long since past, and Hollywood was looking for something new and exciting, younger talent, younger directors were taking the forefront and ageing stars like John Wayne and James Stewart were being phased out, Bonnie and Clyde along with several other films of the time were breaking the cycle, step forward New Hollywood, and the land of film was going to change forever.

It's a movie full of twisting emotions: it can be cruel and nauseating, but it also has scenes that offer sympathy, and heartbreak. It can also be very funny between character interactions.""Good afternoon,"" Clyde would say when they walked into a bank. ""This is the Barrow Gang."" In a way Bonnie and Clyde were pioneers, consolidating the vein of violence in American history and exploiting it, for the first time in the mass media. This is one of the few films I've watched that I was convinced of when someone died, they actually died. When people are shot in ""Bonnie and Clyde."" they are literally blown to bits. Perhaps that seems shocking. But perhaps at this time, it is useful to be reminded that bullets really do tear skin and bone. The performances throughout the film are flawless. Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway as Bonnie and Clyde in the title roles, are brilliant. Bonnie is the kind of character that is intrigued by Clyde, while Clyde is a boastful and proud naive man who's happy doing his own thing.Michael J. Pollard, as C.W. Moss, the driver and mechanic for the gang, is seen as the comic relief of the gang. When Bonnie tells him, ""We rob banks,'' and asks him to come along, he says nothing. But the expression on his face and the movements of his body create a perfect, delightful moment, not just in him but in the audience as well. Gene Hackman and Estelle Parsons play Buck and Blanche Barrow, the other members of the gang. When Buck is reunited with his kid brother, they howl with glee and punch each other to disguise the truth that they have nothing to say. He makes a very good convincing brother to Clyde. Blanche, at first, bothered me, as she was only good at screaming and being annoying whenever she was on screen. However, there is character to her and she is convincing as the group member who's happy to go for the ride.It's clearly one of the best movies I've seen in a long while. It's also considered a landmark, and I can see why. It's clear that ""Bonnie and Clyde"" is not only seen as one of the best biographical films and gangster films, but also one of the best films of the 1960s, showing with sadness, humor and unforgiving detail what one society had come to. They were two nobodies who got their pictures in the paper by robbing banks and killing people. They weren't very good at the bank robbery part of it, but they were fairly good at killing people and absolutely first-class at getting their pictures in the paper.",Bonnie and Clyde

That'll be fun.,1,5 February 2021,"When this movie came out it was touted as groundbreaking, it was said that it would change American cinema forever and Arthur Penn was applauded. By his fellow dolts in Hollywood anyway. It nauseated me then and it still does now. Thankfully Netflix set the record straight with The Highwaymen last year.
Bonnie and Clyde murdered a lot of people, and not just police officers, regular people with families, for no other reason than they enjoyed it. They were full blown psychopaths who resembled Warren Beatty and Fay Dunaway about as much as I do. I have a real problem with glorifying murderers and making them into half-assed folk heroes, I really do.
Hollywood has never had a choke-hold on reality and I suppose they never will but this goes beyond that, this is supposed to be about real people; Bonnie and Clyde were real people, they bore no resemblance to anything in this movie. Other than the fact that they killed people and even that is stylized here.This is a typical ultra-violent ""stylish"" movie of the 1960's that unfortunately set the standard for years to come. Don't bother, it's not only dated, it was never that good to begin with and the way it treats it's subject matter is disgusting.",Bonnie and Clyde
172,filmbuff-36,The movie that made it okay to sympathize with murderers...,10,30 October 2001,"First of all, let me say that I'm appalled by the real life Bonnie and Clyde.  They were two psychopathic thrill killers from Dallas who had a special hatred for law enforcement officers.  I must admit that I do feel sorry for the way they were killed, but like the old axiom goes, ""If you live by the sword, you die by the sword.""That said, the movie ""Bonnie and Clyde"" was a groundbreaking film.  It was the first time that we the audience were allowed inside the killers minds, and could see what made them tick.  This is perhaps the first film that takes a somewhat objective look at crime; we the audience don't have ""FBI Seal of Approval"" morality shoved down our throats, but we still can tell by the actions of the characters that they are evil, whether they know it or not.The story is of two Texas young adults who, bored with their lives and the prospects of going nowhere in the world, decide to live out their dreams of stardom by going on a crime spree.  They fancy themselves a sort of ""Romeo and Juliet"" couple, and think of their robberies as harmless fun.  They start out small by knocking over grocery stores and gas stations, but soon graduate to banks when they need more money to accommodate their lifestyle. Soon they have a simple minded gas clerk named C.W. and Clyde's brother and wife in the gang, and the duo goes down into history.Then the fun and games are over.  With law enforcement officials now looking for Bonnie and Clyde, they become targets of bounty hunters, unethical cops and other greedy persons who wish to make a name for themselves, and they lose a part of their childish innocence as the escalation of their crimes makes them become more and more violent.  When death finally comes for Bonnie and Clyde, it comes with a vengeance.Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway have never been better.  Beatty, who plays Clyde Barrow as an impotent, ne'er do well country boy who seems to be sowing his wild oats, is in top form.  He makes Clyde likable, with a goofy smile perpetually pasted on his face, even when sticking up a bank with two guns in his hands.  Dunaway is the ultimate femme fatale as Bonnie Parker, a sweet natured Southern belle who likes the feel of a .38 in her hands as she politely asks for all the money.  It's absurd, it's unrealistic, but hey, it's Hollywood.  And the film works.But most importantly, Bonnie and Clyde are in love.  It's a kind of love that only few films afterward have been able to equal.  There is a genuine feeling of giddy romance between the two no matter what the scene, be it a bank robbery or family get-together away from the reaches of society.Arthur Penn was obviously a man on a mission when he directed this film. You could sense with every frame that he knew of the importance of this movie; a cinematic masterpiece that dares to make its audience evoke pathos for what would have been banned just a few years earlier.The finale is still to this day a triumph of audience manipulation.  The two bandits, finally captured and unable to escape, are dealt with in a fashion that will haunt you days after viewing.  It's sad, it's disgusting, but it brings closure to the lives of two individuals whose works and existence could not be tolerated by the powers that be.The movie ""Bonnie and Clyde"" inspired a generation of film makers to look at cinema in a different light.  Actions movies were allowed to be funny from this point; funny movies could get away with violence.  On the negative side, however, the film changed the morals of Hollywood by allowing murder to be dealt with in such a nonchalant fashion.Sure, Claude is obviously shaken up after his first kill, as are Bonnie and C.W., but from that point on violence against law officials is no longer a problem.  The police in this film are rather like the way gangsters used to be portrayed; a collection of stupid, soulless individuals who only want to ruin Bonnie and Clyde's fun.In the end, this in an excellent film about Depression era gangsters. Most ironically, however, is that it seems dedicated to the two real life robbers who don't deserve such an honor of having a film legacy created in their names.10 stars.

Penn tells us, through his quasi-authentic retelling of two infamous bank robbers, that violence only begets even more violence, and that every time you shoot a gun, you're liable to get your pants (and skirts) pretty messed up!Most important, Penn tells us that these criminals were a product of a skewed National code ethic... and doesn't that sound all too familiar during the anti-establishment world of the '60s?",Bonnie and Clyde

He was sharp, has his own issues and got the attitude of a robber very well. Faye Dunaway in particular gives me the laughs also throughout the film. She's superb as well in portraying her character well. I got hauled in drama most especially. The gun sequence were also impressive since 60's.

Like Stanley Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange', this film presents our protagonists as unapologetic antiheroes, and we're never asked to feel pity for them. The result is that we simply go along with the film, watching Bonnie and Clyde on their various exploits, and – like 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' – we know what's in store for them, but we don't really mind. The film isn't afraid to be brutal, and although I don't shy away from on-screen gore, one scene left me feeling rather surprised, as I didn't know that such cinematic violence could be fathomed in 1967! The performances were altogether great. I initially thought that Warren Beatty was miscast, and wondered what it would have been like if Paul Newman or Jack Nicholson had taken the role of Clyde, but the chosen actor won me over relatively soon. Faye Dunaway shows a level of expression that, if I remember rightly, is superior to her later performance in Roman Polanski's 'Chinatown'; therefore I'd say that the leading performers were at their absolute best in 'Bonnie and Clyde'. You can also look forward to a strong supporting performance by Gene Hackman, and a very enjoyable couple of scenes featuring Gene Wilder. Overall, the unapologetic, menacing and refreshingly unambiguous 'Bonnie and Clyde' is absolutely not a film to miss.",Bonnie and Clyde
176,brower8,"Has everything but accuracy, but entertaining nonetheless.",9,25 August 2003,"Bonnie and Clyde (the movie) scared people at the time of its release because it supposedly glamorized killers. Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway looked glamorous, but we wouldn't have watched the movie if the protagonists weren't made attractive. The attractiveness is entirely physical even if we still hate what they did -- robbing and killing.Crime should not be glamorized. Criminals are exploiters and destroyers, and in the 1930s criminality had to be seen as particularly offensive. Any criminal was stealing food off someone's table in those precarious times. If they killed, they created an unrelieved hardship for loved ones in a time in which the only safety net was the extended family. That is all resolved in the end (further detail is a spoiler, but it's all in the historical record). Police work and especially equipment in the 1930s was primitive by modern standards, and crooks like Bonnie and Clyde were able to exploit the crevices of law enforcement known as state lines. State lines are no longer barriers to law enforcement. We see a surprising amount of comic elements: the pair's attempts to impress such a dullard as ""C.W. Post"", their bad poetry and taunts of law enforcement, and their efforts to excuse their crimes to their families. ""We'll quit robbing banks when the economy turns around"", or something to the effect. Yes -- and tigers can give up the carnivorous habit if they so desire (irony intended). We also see the gang kidnapping Eugene Grizzard (Gene Wilder), whom they release after they find out that he's an undertaker, demonstrating their superstitious tendencies.It's surprisingly entertaining, even having some levity. Although the pair is undeniably evil, they are at the least charming and almost witty. Maybe not the uncouth, ugly dullards of reality, but would you have watched that?It's unlikely that there will ever be another pair of criminals like Bonnie (Parker) and Clyde (Barrow) who get away for long; police work is too good these days, and police radio makes escape of such thugs less likely. To be successful bank robbers in our time, the robbers must be smart, rational, and secretive; they dare not expose much of their personalities.",Bonnie and Clyde

179,shadow_blade-89459,Great Film,9,23 July 2018,"""Bonnie and Clyde"" (1967) is a crime action biography about Bonnie Parker, played by Faye Dunaway, and Clyde Barrow, played by Warren Beatty, as they begin their violent crime spree and slightly odd love affair. The introduction between Bonnie and Clyde in this film makes a lot of sense even though it feels a little unfeasible, but after that initial connection, everything falls into place. I personally don't have any major feelings about this film except a great deal of appreciation. It is difficult to fault anything about the storyline if it is an accurate biography, but visually this film is great. For the era that this film was created in, the colors and tone were stupendous. Every color that was portrayed on the screen came across as intended.Traditionally, older films have a heavy feel of ""over acting"" to help get the point across, but this film was spot on. Though the film isn't without a few detracting flaws, like audio drop offs and bad audio syncing, the acting was strong enough to keep the audience interested. Overall, I really enjoyed this film even if it is not a normal watch for me. I encourage everyone to view it at least once to appreciate a staple that propelled what we watch today.",Bonnie and Clyde
180,iamyuno2,The Best Of The Bonnie And Clyde and Depression Era Gangster Films,9,28 December 2013,"This rises above its genre to be a most memorable movie - and one that set the bar for all others of its type afterward. It kept pretty much to the story, too, which is something I demand in a historical recreation (although Clyde's sexual ""problem"" is up for debate). Even the music was memorable. Here you find some of the best performances, too, of its stars - certainly Beatty and Dunaway (although Beatty was in some fine films afterward - most notably Bugsy and Reds). And though you might not remember many lines from this film, you will remember many of its scenes, which become indelibly etched in your brain. And I have to differ with critics of its time - including (inexplicably) Estelle Parsons, who played Blanche - who claimed this movie glorified violence. No way. I think the price these lovers - and those around them - paid is graphically depicted as a cautionary tale. What it does (which may have been disturbing to those critics) is that it reveals the characters' humanity. The movie also excels as a historical film in that it dramatizes the pressures the Depression put on everyone (in a way few films have done - short of The Grapes Of Wrath), making them do things they might not otherwise have done. A tour de force by movie maker Beatty - and an iconic and ground-breaking film that stands above the rest.",Bonnie and Clyde
181,aidosh94,I just finished watching it...,10,2 October 2007,"...and this was a film that really touched me. I don't really know why, cause it's about bank robbers. No, it's not really. Not all of it. It's about love and two people who would do anything for each other. My favourite scene was actually the very last scene, not just because they got shot (I didn't want them to get shot!) but because it was a beautifully shot scene and so touching and sad. I just wanted to cry when they died...Warren Beatty was awesome as Clyde Barrow and played his role believable and just... well, great!Personally I think that Faye Dunaway deserved an Academy Award for her role as Bonnie Parker, the innocent sweet girl who got swept away by Clyde and goes on a bank-robbing journey (which ends in disaster) which turns out to be the greatest thing that has happened in her life so far.This was a really good, classic movie. Oscar-movie! And it has surely touched a lot of people so far and it has absolutely touched me.10/10",Bonnie and Clyde
182,lukecon-63436,A groundbreaking experience,8,15 September 2020,"Bonnie and Clyde is certainly a different look at two famous outlaws. It offers a new picture at their character other than the fact that they were involved in the criminal lifestyle. Instead, it uses a different technique-actually making the audience understand their deep character and family, etc.
This is groundbreaking filmmaking, especially since it painted a new portrait of these outlaws, and certainly offers some food for thought about these two outlaws. The audience understands more about these outlaws, however, other than their criminal side. This helps us gain insight about these characters.
Bonnie and Clyde also includes well-filmed cinematography. The cinematography brilliantly captures several moments in the film by displaying these moments in a well-filmed fashion. The shots used are effective as a result, which adds to the brilliance of the film.
However, note that there is some very intense violence with some blood, but otherwise, Bonnie and Clyde is appropriate for mature teens.",Bonnie and Clyde

This film was among the first or perhaps the very first film to show real blood and realistic violence. Films like Bonnie and Clyde helped bring down the strict grip the censors placed on films. Bonnie and Clyde takes you through an adventure in violence and wrongdoing. And at the end they get what they deserve. Although the ending is nothing new, the brutality and grotesqueness of it was groundbreaking for its time.I do wish more time was taken to develop the characters and their partnership. It seemed like the film just rushed in to the shooting and violence. I thought the two lead characters did a fine job. But I did not however, like the roles of Hackman and Parsons. Their overacting was a distraction. Particularly that of Parson, who's screaming and yelling is annoying. Also, the kid's role to me was a mystery. He was little more than a background distraction.

I enjoy the concept of the film, the dysfunctional couple that rob banks. The action is very fast paced but gripping, with the extremely loud gunshots. Also the banjo music the film uses is quite catchy, it adds the characters of both Bonnie and Clyde. It fits with the location, which can look bland but fits the theme of the depression time period.Sometimes the plot is quite confusing, as scenes do not really stop or start. They can be quite jarring, as scenes change quite dramatically. I think after a few rewatches it might be easier to understand. A good film that led to many more great ones!",Bonnie and Clyde

Seeing the movie now one might not think it anything special, but the blood, the anti-hero mentality and the hail of machine gun bullets changed movies forever. Faye Dunaway gives an amazing performance as Bonnie Parker. Beatty does a swell job also along with support by Gene Hackman. This is not at all accurate to the true Bonnie and Clyde story, but that doesn't make it not great. Think of it as partially fictionalized like the film ""Badlands"", but even better.

Also, I don't know which is more painful: Warren Beatty attempting a southern accent or the incessant banjo music that's sure to drive one insane after a point. The real Bonnie Parker didn't have a 1960s hairstyle like Faye Dunaway does nor did Clyde look anything like Warren Beatty.

189,yellowtail_tuna,Traveling criminals in The Great Depression era,9,15 August 2020,"Based on a true story, the film features the titular famous criminal couple. Traveling north from Texas, they repeatedly rob banks, murder people who are in their way, and finally die in a police ambush. It may sound simple, but as we go along with them, we see at every turn an unexpected event and unexpected people. Consequently, it shows a very broad range of human lives.Bonnie and Clyde meet just by chance. When they started, they thought they have somewhere to go, but they gradually realize they don't. So they are just wandering. It's natural for us citizen audience to want them to get punished, and we don't have to wait for that until the ending. Every time they think of their future, they find nothing but despair. The other three accomplices are equally miserable.Scenes where criminals with no future wandering beautiful prairie are somehow dreamingly beautiful. Indoor scenes are precisely controlled by light and camera movement. Bluegrass music is played in some runaway scenes, which sounds kind of ironic because we know it's fake cheerfulness.As a history film, It's interesting to see the landscape of The Great Depression era. Bonnie and Clyde somewhat share a sentiment with people in poverty. An old man, whose house has been taken away by the bank, is amused when Clyde shoots the sign put by the bank. Later people in a homeless campsite kindly treat the injured couple knowing who they are. I would not say these things justify their crimes, but I think this film makes no sense without considering the background that they have emerged from.",Bonnie and Clyde

Everything--from the very first credit to that last shocking scene--fits perfectly. Sure, the plot is romanticized. Who cares?To those who are worried about the violence, I'll say that it is nothing compared to today's movies--Bonnie and Clyde is appropriately upsetting without being gratuitous or glorified. The movie itself is mostly dramatic in nature but it isn't a ""drama"", per se.

191,DylansFearFiles,The Story of Romeo and Juliet With Guns,8,10 August 2009,"Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow are names that we all run across in our lives. The two young people were lovers in the 1930s (the Public Enemy era), that killed people and robbed banks. They have gained much fame and a cultural significance that they don't deserve, we can attribute part of that to this film, which renewed America's interest in the Barrow gang. Bonnie and Clyde is loosely based on their story.Faye Dunaway is Bonnie Parker, a waitress in Dallas, Texas who runs into a small-time crook, Clyde Barrow (played by Warren Beatty), who is trying to steal her mother's car. Bonnie quickly gains an interest in Clyde, who she discovers very soon is an ex-con. She isn't bothered by it, but it intrigues her all the more. Clyde even commits armed robbery right in front of her. Bonnie and Clyde begin a romantic relationship and embark on a life of crime with a gang that the two recruit that extends all the way to the couple's demise. The supporting cast includes Gene Hackman, Estelle Parsons (in her Academy Award-winning role), and Michael J. Pollard.This movie, like I said, is only loosely based on the true story. It simplifies that facts but never ceases to be entertaining. This is a great movie, a masterpiece even. Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway have a very good chemistry on the screen and fit their roles. Bonnie and Clyde is also one of the first R-rated movies. This is a good mixture of romance and crime, I hope you enjoy it.9/10",Bonnie and Clyde

193,YellowManReanimated,A '60s reinterpretation of a Depression-era duo,10,8 August 2021,"A quotation often misattributed to the late, great John Ford is: ""When you have to choose between history and the legend, print the legend."" Bonne & Clyde are two '60s legends in the guise of historical Depression-era outlaws. They are young, they are charismatic, they are beautiful, they are living life on-the-edge and they are in the midst of a moving love story. They are also bank robbers, terrorising American towns and evading the law through cunning, skill and, for a while, a stretch of good luck. Their good-natured robbing won't be able to last forever, though, as the forces of society eventually bring an end to their unconventional ways.As protagonists, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway ooze charm and romance. Never had cinema previously had the gall or the style to make crime appear so seductive or so glamorous. The film has the feeling of a western as much as of a crime film in the sense that its leads are not represented so much as enemies of society but more as heroic rebels, transgressing societal norms in order to live a more fulfilled, if shorter, existence. The film plays into a burgeoning '60s sense of antiauthoritarianism. It also captures the growing appeal of fame and celebrity, an example of which being Bonnie and Clyde bristling with pleasure at seeing their names mentioned in the national newspapers.Never has a film that ostensibly depicts a historical period felt so much a product of its contemporary environment. The real Bonnie & Clyde may have been Depression-era outlaws; however, Arthur Penn's Bonnie & Clyde are '60s rebels who know their fate in advance and yet embrace every moment of their journey along the way to meet it.",Bonnie and Clyde
194,paulsrobinson,A terrific New Hollywood Movie,9,19 April 2013,"""This here's Miss Bonnie Parker. I'm Clyde Barrow. We rob banks.""The film that opened the curtain, for the now known as New Hollywood era. Bonnie and Clyde is a great movie deserving it's high praise and influential reputation. The film follows Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow from their first meeting to their rise to nationally known folk hero bank robbers. The folk hero status stemming from the period, and the depression era. the two's celebrity seemed to out match, their actual criminal exploits and talents. Which for me helps portray the characters with a child like innocence about them. As it seems on occasion they don't fully understand what their actions mean, and how they affect others. The acting is terrific through out, Warren Beatty being very charismatic, and having a fitting Cheshire cat type smile, helping to portray a smartest guy in the room kind of aurora. With Faye Dunaway for me giving the best performance in the picture, her character has a certain snobbery element to her, and the celebrity the two of them receive, only seems to heighten this feeling of entitlement. The supporting cast also deserve massively high praise. With Michael J Pollard, Gene Hackman, and Estelle Parsons, playing fellow outlaws and members of the gang.One of my favorite parts of the movie are two of the death scenes which are directed so well, and actually made me jump with how hard and shocking they were. Standing the test of time, and just as realistic as any movie made now. the one criticism i would make of the movie is the slapstick comedy moments it tries to play at times, does not quite work. Making the characters seem to buffoonish, to be taken seriously at times.Overall this film is showing a part of American criminal history.

This film is a classic, but there were some glaring issues with it. The pacing was completely off. I was constantly bored. There were scenes that worked and others that dragged. The score was horrific. In fact, there was no music at all except for a banjo tune that played every time the criminals drove away in their car after committing a crime. Also, the Blanche character was overly irritable, which was kind of the point, but it was overdone. Also, there were many parts of the film that made no sense. For a plot that is so simple, it was sometimes confusing. Also, the sheriff who was introduced in the halfway point of the film returned only in the last 20 minutes. He should've been a recurring character, not one shrouded by the main bunch of characters. Minor, but there were some slight issues with the direction. Besides that, it was decent.

199,vangamer,Fatalistic Rollercoaster,10,16 February 2021,"Death is waiting.It's in the opening credits as names tint from white to blood red. An undertaker passes through, a farmer points to a coming funeral and Bonnie Parker pens poetry foretelling her own death.Bonnie and Clyde is a morality tale destined to end inevitably with extreme violence. But before we get there two young and glamorous people - far more glamorous than the real-life criminals portrayed - will kick at the world as banjos blaze and evicted farmers make them folk heroes.Director Arthur Penn's classic features some real events and characters but it was never intended to document reality - and those who criticize its ""lack of historical realism"" totally miss the point - and why this movie grabbed the public's imagination back in 1967.Inspired by France's New Wave and made as Vietnam War protests made anti-establishmentarianism fashionable, Bonnie and Clyde was a very subversive call to ride along with the bad guys - because it made you pay a price.That was its genius.The subversion comes as we're sucked into the gang's folksy spree. We're lured into snickering at the law with them - until Clyde shoots a man's face without warning as we laughed at a bungled getaway. It was bloody, the most graphically violent image in a major movie to that time. It shocked by raising the stakes. From now on we were complicit, riding along as the gangs robs and kills.Like the Barrow gang we're on a fatalistic rollercoaster - we know what's coming - but we can't get off. The tone was underscored by the film's provocative ad line: ""They're young. They're in love. They kill people.""But, yes. taking on the system comes at a cost - a theme echoed in movies from Easy Rider to Vanishing Point to Warren Beatty's Parallax View. It doesn't matter that you're young, good-looking or convinced that armed robbery isn't so bad. On a clear sunny day, death lurks in the bushes - waiting for you.",Bonnie and Clyde
200,jryan-4,reclyding position,10,15 December 2000,"I just finished watching Bonnie and Clyde with my Cinematic Lit. students. I had some trepidation about showing the film because of the graphic violence that I remembered from seeing the film, first run, in 1967.In 1967, I was at Geneseo. About once a month I would make my way to the one theater in town, the Palace, and sit myself down. When Bonnie and Clyde arrived, I knew absolutely nothing about the film other than that Warren Beatty was in it. From the title, I thought it was going to be some kind of screwball comedy with `Clyde' being at the time a `funny' name.Needless to say I was unprepared for the intensity and intentionisity of the film.   I, of course, loved the film but I was so shaken by it that I vowed never to see it again. Thirty three years passed before I broke my vow. Bonnie and Clyde rates 27th on the AFI list of American films. I'm teaching a film class. I figured I better look at Bonnie and Clyde again and learn what the kids can teach me so I can become a better teacher.The kids taught me that they were not bothered by the violence at all, although they appreciated B and C for the role it played in the state of movies today and for how violent it must have felt `at the time' it was made.I have to agree with the kids. Compared to what we've seen in the decades since, the violence in Bonnie and Clyde is comparatively mild. The violence is accentuated by point of view and characterization. We root for Bonnie and Clyde. They mean no harm. Beatty is handsome and Dunaway is beautiful. Clyde doesn't seem to be particularly sex driven. The concept of a man, like Clyde, uncertain about his potency seems visionary and affecting in these Viagra driven days. Bonnie loved her mother and Dunaway was twenty years from Mommie Dearest. CJ Moss had a tattoo which seemingly bothered his father more than the fact that he was a bank robber and accessory to murder. CJ couldn't figure out what was wrong with his tattoo and neither could the students watching the film with me. Gene Hackman's performance as Buck Barrow engages with fraternal familiarity and promises leading man prominence. Estelle Parsons? Well she was the only one of the five to win an Academy Award, even though she did go on to play RoseAnne's mom.As I commented on the violence and tried to make sure the students weren't shocked or offended by it, one member of the class sought to soothe my concern.` Mr. Ryan, if you're worried about the violence at the end of Bonnie and Clyde look at it this way. We're used to seeing movies where scenes like the ending of Bonnie and Clyde are shown at the very beginning, sometimes while the credits are still rolling'.I realized the truth in that observation and wondered then as I'm wondering now not only about how far we've come but also about what direction we are traveling. I know that violent crime in America has decreased for the past seven years. Perhaps Bonnie and Clyde in 1967 was a difficult pill to swallow that took twenty five years to take effect.",Bonnie and Clyde
201,Tralequang,This movie does not age so well,7,16 February 2020,"Bonnie and Clyde was a comical watch for me. After all the modern action movies I was exposed to, the quality and logic of the action failed to enthral me. Rather, what kept me watching was the curiosity about the relationship development, and the comedic element in the scenes.The acting is acceptable, although in the early scenes, Bonnie's body language is a bit extra.Idea wise, the movie glorifies the couple to some extent, through the praise of C.W, the help of the pagan tribe and the way they show the poem. Romance wise, we can see a passionate relationship between two people sharing the same adventurous view towards life. It is a beautiful yet sinful love.To me, some time later, Bonnie and Clyde will remain an average action packed romcom, iconic yet disappointing.",Bonnie and Clyde

The part of Bonnie is played perfectly by the beautiful Faye Danaway who is really joy to watch. The movie is not for the squeamish ones and has some extremely bloody violence (that was truly shocking for the audience at the time it was released) mixed with black humor (something that our generation's genius Tarantino does). Also the movie has a witty and smart dialog and every single line is memorable. The supporting cast features a young Gene Hackman at the beginning of his magnificent career as Clyde's brother, and Estelle Parsons (in an Oscar winning performance) as his wife. The cinematography is delightful and the hot southern scenery never looked better. Despite of it's #222 at the top 250 list I believe it's under-rated because there is no way there are more than 200 better movies than this one.

205,nerdomatic10-937-667230,A near-perfect classic,10,26 January 2014,"TCM showed this the other night, and I hadn't watched it from start to finish in decades. It's just a fantastic flick, with so much going on, both on the surface and deep underneath. I'd even forgotten how incredible the beginning is. After the opening credits, the very first thing we see is a beautiful, naked, bored, irate, frustrated, horny, desperate Faye Dunaway. She angrily flounces around her bedroom, slamming things, then happens to look out her second-floor window just in time to spot a dapper Warren Beatty lurking by her mother's car. Wearing only a dress and shoes, she rushes out to confront him. Clyde sweet-talks her and takes her downtown to buy her a ""Co-Cola"". She uses her bottle as a phallic symbol, and when Clyde pulls out his pistol (no, not that one), she caresses the barrel lovingly and dares him to use it. Which he does, and they're off and running, together to the end. That's only the first few minutes. ""B&C"" gets better and better and gathers more and more momentum until the shocking finish. Clyde is everything Bonnie was hoping for, without her even realizing it at the time. He's handsome, reckless, spontaneous, blithely unconcerned with rules and laws, and lives totally in the moment. In fact, he's constitutionally incapable of thinking even ten minutes ahead. Anyway, these two are both extremely stupid and completely lost in the world, as well as being an ideal match for each other, however temporary and tragic their union may be.So that's on one level. They're small-time crooks who manage to capture the national media's attention with their lawless escapades and become early versions of tabloid/reality stars. An interesting treatise on fame, because their habit of photographing each other and Bonnie's poetry adeptly feeds the American public's voracious appetite for heroes to worship, as well as our avid fascination with and envy for those same heroes. We live vicariously through them to escape our humdrum existence because it all seems so romantic to be young lovers on the run, doing whatever they want, constantly one step ahead of the law. It's fun for us to read and fantasize about, but Bonnie and Clyde eventually have to pay the ultimate price for our long-distance enjoyment. Hillbilly Christ-figures, in a strange way.The real Bonnie and Clyde only lasted about two years after they started their crime spree, but they must've packed a lot of life into that short time. Modern crime sprees only last a few days, so just imagine one that went on for over two years. Warren and Faye capture our absolute sympathy, but the real couple killed a lot of people; some lawmen, some innocent citizens, as well as destroying a lot of property that regular folks worked hard for. But make the desperadoes great-looking, and we'll follow them straight to Hell.The cast is utterly fantastic, and ""B&C"" was the big break for a list of long-time Hollywood heavyweights. But my favorite was Michael J. Pollard, who was absolutely and precisely right on the money, and that was exactly his problem. He could never be a leading man or a romantic lead or a hero or even an antihero because of his odd appearance and small stature. So all the others rose to the heights and left him behind, although his contribution was at least as vital as all the rest. Also, Dub Taylor, who played his father, was one of the all-time greatest and most magnetic character actors. His performance is so natural and so real, it's like watching one of your crazy relatives, not a movie character.All these towering talents came together to create one of the most essential American films of all time. In fact, it's so good and so intense, it's hard to watch at times. Later flicks stole the gory violence and amorality and ambiguity, but ""Bonnie and Clyde"" was there first. A true original.",Bonnie and Clyde
206,b-gallagher2,Movie review,9,25 April 2011,"This was a good movie. Bonnie and Clyde is a combination of an intense melodrama, romance drama and gratuitously violent psychological thriller. But being made around a basic melodramatic storyline of good vs. evil, the movie is made through the perspective of the evil, Bonnie and Clyde. The dark part is that the way the movie is played out, we start to relate to Bonnie and Clyde and develop emotional feelings towards them. This is a very dark thing to do, because Bonnie and Clyde were essentially outlaws to society. One thing that really struck me as classic ""New Hollywood"" was how violent the shoot out scenes were, how visually omniscient and graphic it was to see. This is all something that you could never see during the hays code. I think this movie was really deriving around exploring the mind of Clyde, how messed up he was. He was normal on the outside, but his methods and beliefs were nothing more than abnormal on the inside. Then through his looks and talk he manages to win over a pretty young lady named ""Bonnie."" After that he assembles his own crew of criminals. This was a very fascinating movie to watch because it was one of the first gritty crime films ever made, where the filmmakers had complete freedom to show it as gratuitous as they wanted.",Bonnie and Clyde
207,brefane-41162,Not all that,7,14 January 2016,"NY Times' critic Bosley Crowther's negative review of the film was said to have led to his being replaced because he was considered out of touch with current fashion. He felt the film was clumsy, sentimental claptrap, compared it to the Keystone cops and The Beverly Hillbillies and felt that a disreputable gang of morons were presented as full of fun and frolic. Many, especially Pauline Kael, felt it was a landmark film and one of the most important films of the 60s. In truth, this is an entertaining film yet poor old Bosley was not entirely wrong. The film is uneven and motivation and character are never really explored. The police are indeed somewhat like the Keystone cops and seemingly give up pursuit easily and early. There are sentimental interludes, and though Bonnie and Clyde kill people, the only serious injuries depicted are those done to the Barrow gang by the police;their wounds and suffering are lingered on. Beatty and Dunaway seem too sophisticated to be playing this juvenile hillbilly couple and Dunaway's style seems far more 60s than 30s. Indeed, the film sparked a fashion trend. Dede Allen's editing is excellent and the supporting cast is arguably more effective than the leads. An enormous popular and critical success in its day, Bonnie and Clyde is still worth seeing though to my mind The Miracle Worker (1962) is director Penn's best film.",Bonnie and Clyde
208,jacobywarner,Incredible for its Time,8,19 December 2019,"This is a truly timeless film that depicts a strange love story that uniquely challenges the social norms of a ""regular relationship.""The strongest aspect of this film to me was the acting, Warren Beatty gave the performance of his life portraying the love stricken bank robber. Staring alongside Faye Dunaway, their chemistry on screen was truly revolutionary.It is for those reasons that I am giving this film an 8/10.",Bonnie and Clyde
209,dataconflossmoor-1,Any Subject Whatsoever!,10,11 April 2011,"The year was 1967, a groundbreaking year for movies, the Academy Award nominees were: ""The Graduate"" ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner"", ""In The Heat Of The Night"" ""Dr Doolittle"" and, last, but certainly not least, ""Bonnie and Clyde"". All of these films have received the highest form of critical acclaim from one movie critic or another, hence, 1967 became a revolutionary year for film making. Focusing on the movie ""Bonnie and Clyde"", AFI (American Film Institute) rates ""Bonnie and Clyde"" the 27th best picture out of the top 100 American films ever made. I wholeheartedly concur with this assessment, yet, others may not, and, here is where a great deal of the movie audience members are seemingly missing the boat. When mentioning to people that ""Bonnie and Clyde"" is one of the best films to ever be produced, many moviegoers will get very disparaging and say: ""I don't like gangster films, a movie like that is probably very good, but, a glorified cops and robbers flick could not possibly be one of the best movies ever made""... This is a preconceived notion which is totally erroneous! While many hoodlum bank heist movies are filled with turgid rhetoric, and evoke a sort of sinister adolescent mindset, ""Bonnie and Clyde"" assertively differentiates itself from the run of the mill. Brilliant acting, directing, and the sophisticated concept of colorfully accurate costuming, establishes ""Bonnie and Clyde"" as a stellar production in the Hollywood paradigm for films. It is true that many genres run a higher risk of being easily categorized as ""stilted"" more than others, and, gangster flicks are indeed, films which frequently fall into that classification. In the case of ""Bonnie and Clyde"", however, labeling it just another flashy and overbearing gangster movie would be an egregious miscarriage of justice.!! The picture ""Bonnie and Clyde"" establishes a set of vitriolic circumstances which create a vivid aura of insurrection from the anti-establishment. This was a technique that became the most effective form of entertainment to mesmerize the movie audience!! As a result, ""Bonnie and Clyde"" initiated a cinematic precedent by advocating the proverbial dark horse philosophy which other movies followed suit on back in the late sixties! Such a high profile presentation of early twentieth century bank robbing chicanery establishes a bevy of hard bitten accuracy through depraved channels of belligerence and rudimentary lust! Subsequently, this film became an acrimonious portrayal of the cause and effect traumas of the Great Depression! This major motion picture purports an authenticity to the aggregate rancor which prevailed between dangerous gangsters, and the officials working for the law during the late 1920's and early 1930's. The hostile fragility contained in the conversations with everyone signified a defensive reflex that criminals like Bonnie and Clyde harbored to vindicate their heinous acts of violence and robbery. This was one of the first films to depict the disconcerting scenario where the good guys and the bad guys are not sequestered by ethical polarization. The Great Depression demoralized virtually all U.S. citizens in one way or another! Invariably, poverty becomes the culprit to adversity, adversity brings about illicit behavior, and bandits such as Bonnie and Clyde are by products of this entire dilemma. Capital crimes served a purpose to flaunt a formidable individuality and acknowledgment for the nefarious perpetrators involved. While ""Bonnie and Clyde"" did not win for best picture in 1967, (That award was given to ""In The Heat of the Night"") ""Bonnie and Clyde"" had an irrevocable impact on the cinema world back in 1967. This is mostly on account of the fact that ""Bonnie and Clyde"" exuded an intensely haunting realism through the implementation of an absolutely fascinating and acutely glamorous dynamic. The acting was so incredible in this movie: It comprises of: Warren Beaty ( Actor, director, writer, producer, and, oh yeah!! Ladies Man!!). Faye Dunaway (World renown actress, particularly for her roles in ""Chinatown"" and ""Network""). Gene Hackman, (Basically the best in the business; Famous for ""French Connection"" and ""The Conversation"" to name a couple). Gene Wilder, (Hysterically funny! and, star of ""Young Frankenstein"").In addition, this movie contained a host of other great performers, including Estelle Parsons, Parsons won the Oscar for best supporting actress with this role. The timing to the volatility, the emotions, and the archaic introductory harbinger to realistic violence in ""Bonnie and Clyde"" are sensational! ""Bonnie and Clyde"" is a cunningly successful masterpiece in the Hollywood repertoire of major motion pictures. The cinematography, and the camera angles to the movie ""Bonnie and Clyde"" manufactured a cannon of creativity which made this movie production truly innovative! Director, Arthur Penn, ascertains a succinct articulation of the pejorative human element with this film. This enables the movie audience to garner a precarious camaraderie with the dubious plight of wanted criminals. The invidious disposition to this movie's desultorily criminal Depression laden era formats a situation whereby the purveyors of societal injustice are cavorting around on both sides of the law! Whether a movie is about elusive New Yorkers, space time continua, or visceral bank robbing thugs during the Depression, the key to making a remarkable movie is predicated on the superb manner in which the movie is produced! Essentially, a film is judged by how it is auspiciously consummated from head to toe! With the coveted accolade of being up for nine Academy Award nominations back in 1967, ""Bonnie and Clyde"" should be commended as being one of the greatest American films ever made!! ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR!!",Bonnie and Clyde
210,Sweets742,great,9,11 May 2010,"I love this film so much. I love the actors especially, they are what made the film. I thought it would be a lot more dramatic but I still loved it. I love the fact that they were a great looking couple running from the cops. I loved the character Bonnie Parker, she was a real bad girl. You don't see a lot of girl villains in films even now a days. I thought she changed the tradition male robber, she brought edge. I loved the sounds, it was a lot different the films from the pervious era's. The camera work was great as well as the editing. The ""special effects"" such as the car chase and what not wasn't the greatest in my opinion. But hey it's the 60s what can I say.",Bonnie and Clyde
211,CaseyIMDB,Crime,9,27 April 2011,"Bonnie and Clyde is referred to some peoples vocabulary. I never really understood the whole ""Bonnie and Clyde"" thing until i watched this movie. Bonnie and Clyde meet when Clyde gets bored of her job and tries to steal Bonnies car. They become partners in crime and start causing mischief the whole movie. I have always heard people talking about Bonnie and Clyde and i thought it just meant a strong relationship. I never knew it had to do with being ""partners in crime"" like they were. The acting was fairly good, there were some parts i was kind of like ""ehhh"" but everything worked out and the movie wound up playing out pretty well.",Bonnie and Clyde
212,Absyrd,"So here it is, the supposed landmark of the 60s...",10,28 July 2008,"... and deservedly so. This is a relentlessly entertaining, exhilarating crime/romance, which centers around two engaged criminals who run around in stolen cars robbing banks. Simple enough, but it takes intricate, even nowadays, unconventional turns in terms of emotional advancement. Sure, the film romanticizes and at times glorifies the true events it's based on, but whoever said exploitation is essentially a bad thing if done with plausible execution? In terms of acting and craftsmanship, the film's an extravagant success. Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty hold uncanny chemistry, the films actual directing and cinematography is remarkable, its soundtrack very well fits the film's setting, essential characters are never eliminated with ignorant lack of remorse, everyone is given three-dimensional figure and personality... honestly, if I were forced to pick out a flaw, I'd have to rewatch the film for even the slightest continuity error.",Bonnie and Clyde
213,stasia_stasia,A Life of Crime and Romance,7,16 April 2010,"Bonnie and Clyde was a alright movie it wasn't exactly as I had expected. In the beginning during the opening credits I thought it was very interesting to give a small bio of who Bonnie and Clyde really were. The directing and film editing really put the watcher in the mood and placed them in the adventure of what was happening throughout the film. Adding on to the realism of the film and history. The camera angling and the 180 degree rule really caught the moments of conversation. The car chase scenes were very well handled with the widescreen angle shots and careful zoom ins. The montages and long takes during some of the important scenes really adds on to the suspense and drama. Throughout the movie we are given wide view angles to help capture every single piece of situation on what is going on. Basically everything about this film was moderately good from the story line, to the acting, to the directing and film editing. Like I said earlier this movie wasn't exactly as I expected the story was a little slow paced when there are no action scenes going on. Bonnie and Clyde was an alright movie and quite a classic to watch.",Bonnie and Clyde
214,m-bailey8,bonnie and Clyde,8,22 November 2010,"This movie is definitely interesting. From the beginning scene to the end, the movie is definitely Hays Code free. Along with no Hays Code, the movie deals with many issues. Since the movie takes place during the Depression money is tight, so one way to survive is to steal, which Bonnie and Clyde seemed to turn to. It also deals with the social issue of what's right and wrong. Though Bonnie and Clyde, along with their friends, were known as bank robbers, they didn't want to kill anybody and would be nice to most of the people they captured. A few examples of this is the one bank they robbed, Clyde asks a man if that was his money he put down on the bank window. When the man answers yes, Clyde tells him to keep it. Also, when Clyde turns the car around to stop the car that was chasing them, they were nice to them and bought them food. Maybe it was because they saw that the man was Gene Wilder.The writing was good and the acting was good as well. The one scene that I loved was the ending scene when Bonnie and Clyde pull off the road to help C.W's father. I thought how it was cool that from then on there was no dialog. The father gets out of the way and all of a sudden bullets are shot and Bonnie and Clyde, and then everyone walks up to them after there're dead and it is completely silent. I just didn't expect that ending because I thought they were really going to get away. I loved how eerie the scene felt. One lesson that I learned from this movie; if I ever see a man outside my house trying to steal a car, look the other way.",Bonnie and Clyde
215,crivers123,Bonnie And Clyde (1967),8,12 May 2011,"Bonnie and Clyde (1967) was a fast-paced, action packed movie that kept me interested from start to finish. Everyone has heard of the notorious duo, but never before this film did an audience have the chance to feel sympathetic to these criminals. I enjoyed their narrow escapes and their on screen chemistry as actors. Also, it is rumored that Clyde was homosexual and I feel that the film addresses this rumor in its own way; In the beginning Clyde says to Bonnie ""It's not like I like boys"" and then awkwardly bumps his head. Then there was the sex scene between him and Bonnie that ends abruptly with Clyde telling Bonnie ""I told you I wasn't a lover boy"". The ending definitely caught me by surprise. Even though I know that they eventually get killed, the film does such a good job building a connection between the audience and the characters that it makes you want them to get away in the end, despite the historical facts. I feel the ending was so gruesome because the director was trying to build the audience's sympathy. Overall, it was a great film.",Bonnie and Clyde
216,NOXiFy,Amazing story of two people on a road to riches,9,23 April 2012,"I just watched this film and must say that it was a great watch indeed, it follows the story of two people, one female and one male, who are ""business partners"" in the sense that they rob banks and commit multiple crimes to get by in life. The story is very risqué for it's time because it features some perverse scenes that would offend many back in the mid- sixties. The film was shot in color and was captured greatly by the cinematographers. Many action shots and quick shots were edited together and the editing alone most likely took hundreds of hours to make the film perfect. The film also featured some great sound and they were able to generate gun shots and other noises perfectly. I'd definitely see this film again with friends, it's got some awesome robberies and a pretty cool story, on top of that it's got a very graphic scene that just makes the movie ponder in your mind.",Bonnie and Clyde
217,Emillion,"""You might just be the best damn girl in Texas.""",7,13 December 2014,"Bonnie and Clyde is a classic romance, action, crime film. The story is great and the acting is amazing. Warren Beaty was extremely attractive in his prime making him the perfect candidate for the part of the sexy, bad boy, Cylde. The stories very unique in the history of American film because of the controversy it stirred up as many say it glamorized crime. Audience members were sympathetic towards these love- bird criminals and wanted to see that succeed. I like the idea of the film completely and had me intrigued from start to finish. The ending was great and caught me completely off guard. I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good crime flick.",Bonnie and Clyde
218,stillnessbreaker,Well Done,8,16 September 2012,"I thought Bonnie and Clyde was a great film, I thought it was very well done. I liked how it didn't glamorize the life of a thief, Bonnie and Clyde never had time to rest, they were always running, the places they stayed weren't very nice, and people were getting killed most of the time. Through out the film I found myself almost feeling sorry for Bonnie and Clyde, they were made to be likable characters in this film, you liked them as people, and a couple. They seemed like average people not really bad, slightly crazy, but you could, in a way, relate to them. Then at the end the writers woke you up and reminded you of who they were, and then you're left with these mixed emotions of if you really liked them or agreed with how the movie ended. I thought it was a good film to see.",Bonnie and Clyde
219,BatmanAndRobyn,A really interesting film!,8,10 May 2013,"I really enjoyed watching this film! I thought it was paced perfectly and the complexity of the characters and the story kept me interested the whole way through. The fact that this film was made a couple of years after the actual events had happened made it that much cooler to watch. I had previously researched the real Bonnie & Clyde, so I thought the film was a neat adaptation of the events. The actors in this film are what really made it as great as it was. Beatty and Faye have great chemistry in this film and I enjoyed watching them interact on screen. Also, their redheaded sidekick was a wonderful addition that helped add a but of personality to the film. The sound in this movie was great. There were many gunshots and dialogue that often overlapped one another, but I thought that it went along with the film really well.",Bonnie and Clyde

I guess Warren Beatty, as producer, deserves the most credit for assembling such a wonderful creative team. The film's ""look,"" harnessed by Arthur Penn, is unforgettable. The pace of the film is breathtaking. The actors are convincing and sympathetic, but not melodramatic. The themes of the film (obsession with celebrity, bonds of love, rebellion, ""Robin Hood"") are astutely investigated but never cloud the enjoyment of watching it. It's funny, shocking, sad, frightening, sexy, debatable. It's perfect!!",Bonnie and Clyde
221,tabbyharwood,Love and Robbery,9,4 December 2014,"Bonnie and Clyde is one of my all time favorite ""gangster"" movies. The way that love, lust, desire, disobedience and crime is portrayed in this movie was cleverly directed.The movie starts out by showing us a woman in despair that comes across a man trying to steal her mothers car. From that point on the love connection between the two erupts into a crime spree that makes them two of the most wanted famous people ever.The use of lighting in this film help the audience connect with the characters on an emotional level. The 3 angle lighting in both scenes when Bonnie, played by Faye Dunaway; was looking at herself in the mirror gave us a perfect view of her facial expressions of how she was feeling. The close up shots and zooming of in and out on the characters throughout the film kept us in touch with how each situation made them feel.A lot of short clips where used in this movie because the scenes changed quite frequently. From inside the vehicle to out the vehicle. Inside and outside banks, houses, hotels etc. The camera view changes were used in a manner that you were seeing the other character through the others. Example, when the individuals were in the car, the view was just those of the back seat switching to those in the front seat. Giving you the impression that it was each other looking back and forth.The use of non diegetic sounds were used frequently and over and over again within the film. The car getaways, car beeps and gun shots were used throughout the entire film.Although a lot of the scenes were repetitive, based on the content of the movie, it was overall a great movie and I enjoy it and it kept my interest.",Bonnie and Clyde

Bonnie and Clyde are young and invincible however and they don't think anyone can stop them. Unfortunately nothing lasts forever and the couple that gained so much popularity are betrayed in the end and they meet the fate that everyone but them seemed to know is coming.

The movie has cool sounds throughout like the cars tires when they are driving away real fast, the gunshots, and many other things. The movie is about a man named Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker. The two met when Clyde was trying to steal Bonnie's moms car. Bonnie was fascinated with Clyde and his criminal ways. The two then began a life on the run full of crime. They went from robbing little stores to robbing banks and their acts became a lot more violent. The two were chased after one bank robbery and even captured one officer themselves instead of the other way around. When the two stop to help an old man with a flat tire on the side of the road, they didn't realize it was a setup. As soon as they got out of the car police began shooting and the movie begins to go in slow motion to really show how many times they were shot and to show all of the blood, kind of glorifying violence in a way which is something not a lot of movies did at the time. Bonnie and Clyde will always be a fun movie to watch in my opinion.",Bonnie and Clyde
224,Hwos,Good old shoot 'em up gangster flick,6,26 November 2011,"Arthur Penn directed this violent gangster film that returned Hollywood to its violent roots of the 1930's. Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway star as Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker two misunderstood, but unflinchingly violent bank robbers that cut a path across the country, with the law always just a step behind. Beatty was the only famous actor in this film, but Dunaway's performance as well as Gene Hackman's performance as Barrow's brother Buck propelled them all into stardom. Gene Wilder also turned in a hilarious performance in a sheer comic relief role.Penn shot most of this film outside, and in the sunshine which gave the film a very light, and real feel. It didn't seem heavy like previous gangster movies. The film humanized the criminals and justified their brutality by allowing you to see their rationale, and know their motivations. Penn did an outstanding job of telling the story of Bonnie and Clyde, and the actors did an even better job of bringing them to life.",Bonnie and Clyde

It is a fantastic and thrilling crime film with a combination of many different qualities such as those found in comedies, romance films, slap-sticks and of course gangster films.""Bonnie and Clyde"" being made in the same year that the Hayes Production Code was dropped pushed new boundaries in ways of violence, sexuality and language, which of course resulted in much controversy. But seeing as this film was so fully embraced by the younger generation of the 1960s, whom were restless, independent and largely anti-government, ""Bonnie and Clyde"" became one of the most beloved films of a whole new and quickly evolving Hollywood era.One of the most enjoyable and artistically brilliant films that I have ever seen.

226,thecole777,Good,7,6 December 2011,I liked how they rob banks and near the beginning they shot at a house that was taken by one. This movie was not boring and was not hard to watch so it was actually enjoyable but a little long it seemed. I really liked the setting and where they filmed because of all the dirt roads and nice green landscapes. I thought Bonnie's mom was really weird and I don't know if she's supposed to seem weird but that's what I got. During the death scene at the end I liked the quick cuts and how there were so many bullets. I though their death was disturbing and sudden therefor good. I thought the actor for Clide was really good and he was enjoyable. Overall this movie was refreshing and a nice example of new Hollywood.,Bonnie and Clyde

When I first picked this movie up from the library I was really excited about watching it and I couldn't wait to put it in my movie player, however I was slightly disappointed in the movie itself. The movie overall was alright but if a movie does not seem interesting to me as it plays, I will not pay much attention to it and my mind will drift elsewhere. This happened during the movie. It was interesting at parts while other parts did not make much sense to me. Why did Bonnie and Clyde along with the gang pick up the young couple who's car they stole? What was the reason for that? The ending upset me. The police in the end in my opinions were cowards. They lured Bonnie and Clyde into a trap and shot them like a firing squad that was invisible. It was a cowardly move led by a ranger who was embarrassed and wanted revenge.",Bonnie and Clyde

So often do we hear references to the two, but it's hard for the younger generation to really understand who these people were and their story. This film seemed to have revised the gangster film genre forever. The film also had a lot of experimental qualities to it, which was good. It reached out and tried something new, which helped make the film a huge success. The only thing I would say negatively about the movie is that is glorified the life of the real bank robbers, Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker. Bonnie and Clyde is much like a slapstick comedy and not the best representation of their life.",Bonnie and Clyde

In new Hollywood its okay for the ""bad guys"" to more or less be the ""good guys"" at least for the sake of the movie. Clearly, these two bank robbers are on the wrong side of the law, yet they make the audience fall in love with them and are constantly rooting for them to get away. Its hard to say all this when you watch as clyde shoots an innocent bank manager pointblank in the face during a get away, but it was something that had become okay to do in a movie. though, given the opportunity to enjoy watching the criminals succeed in the end the pair still got what they deserved in a brutal killing by machine gun fire in the end.",Bonnie and Clyde

I think that the story was very well planned out and the characters were all interesting in their own way. The violence seen in this could be comparable to some of the gangster type movies of today. I liked how the group got progressively more violent, and in the end just get gunned down in a bloody ambush. I think it all kind of leads up to it. Although I wanted to see them continue on I think that the viewers of the time would not have liked it because they were used to the code and the bad guys had to be punished. They couldn't get away. Interesting movie and definitely worth a watch.",Bonnie and Clyde

However, in this movie it took a different approach in showing two people both male and female working together. Also this movie was regarded as one of the first films of the New Hollywood era. It was said that this movie influenced other directors to be more forward in showing sex and violence in their films. This movie was very enjoyable to watch and had great scenes. The ending of this movie was just shocking in my opinion. Movies now with crazy killing is not as good as the ending of bonnie and Clyde. I was really amazed on how graphic it was like if the shooting was never going stop. This movie was very stimulating and I can watch the ending over and over and over again.",Bonnie and Clyde
235,foxhunter25,Bonnie and Clyde (1967),9,5 December 2012,"I think Bonnie and Clyde was an amazing film. I love crime movies like this. Clyde meets Bonnie when he is trying to steal her mother's car, and from there on they are inseparable. The two of them convince a young mechanic to join them, and Clyde's brother ends up joining the gang with his wife after he killed a policemen. The gang is rather successful and enjoys them selves until one night were they get surrounded. They escape from that only to surrounded again, where Clyde's brother dies and his wife gets captured. In the end bonnie and Clyde decide they are going to stop robbing and stealing and settle down, however they were trick and ambushed. After the cops riddled their bodies with holes they realized Bonie and Clyde didn't actually rob the bank they thought they did; they only got groceries, that they paid for.

237,Dollardave86,Unstoppable Pair,8,9 May 2014,"This film was really special because it was one of those that were created in the New Hollywood era. The film first came to the screen four decades ago , but the theme seems so modern. The film would have the viewer sympathize and understand these ruthless killers. This movie mostly would come out during the Hays Code period. The acting performance of Dunaway and Beatty were, right on point. Over all Bonnie and Clyde made a great pair: together they were dramatic, funny, and exciting. Even though they were on the wrong side of the law the audience still love them and maybe even rooted for them even with all of their robbery wrong doings.",Bonnie and Clyde
238,t-seeberger4,Analysis for Bonnie and Clyde (1967),8,23 April 2014,"This is another one of those films that can make you think twice before you put something into action. It's another great film that people can actually enjoy. It has a lot of good elements in it, including great action scenes, great character portrayal, and some elements from the real event. Those events were real, because the real Bonnie and Clyde did some really terrible things during their time in the West. Sadly, not everything is good about this film. I was unhappy with some parts of the film, especially the one when Hamer made C.W. an ""unexpected suspect"" no longer. I didn't understand it, but the real ending was one that I actually did get. I like how the film ended, because it was like the real life event of Bonnie and Clyde's last moments in many ways. In all, this film is a must-see crime film for those who really like a lot of action. This film is definitely a good movie to watch with others.",Bonnie and Clyde

Being able to see this movie reminded me of the song that my dad used to sing to me. I enjoyed this movie, I thought that the actors were brilliant. They brought the characters to life that I used to be told about when I was a small child. They were everything I thought they were going to be and more. The director showed the scenes with awesome camera angles. It made you feel like you were in the movie with the actors being apart of it all. The movie lived up to my expectations and never disappointing me. It was scripted extremely well and I wouldn't have changed anything about it.",Bonnie and Clyde

This is a wonderfully shot classic film with many fast paced action scenes, car chases and shoot outs. This movie carries along with it a beautiful message as well. In the end as tragic as it is we see love conquers all. This film is still so relevant in its message . It does a fantastic job relating to so many issues in man and woman's relationship, and its message to society. This film standardized the glorification of the crime couple, and crime families. This film is edgy violent and definitely pushed the envelope for its time period.",Bonnie and Clyde
241,MC_Barton,"""They call them cold-hearted killers""",8,8 April 2015,"In a world where television begins to dominate the theaters, it is necessary to make changes. That is exactly what this movie is a product of. Officially ending in 1968, The Hay's Code was still in place but declining rapidly with the out-lash of movies in violation of the delegation set forth by it. However, that doesn't detract from the fact that this movie is a good one, and not just a bystander in the midst of the revolution. ""Bonnie and Clyde"" is regarded as a landmark film, and it's apparent why; sex and violence everywhere! It was a precedent set forth for movies to come, and gave the notion that movies should incorporate what they envision without impeding on content deemed too mature for audiences. While definitely not the most violent now, the ending of the film serves as a suitable rallying cry for reform to the movie industry with it's bloody and gruesome final scene.",Bonnie and Clyde
242,hagen2357,Bonnie and Clyde Review,8,13 May 2015,"Bonnie and Clyde is a significant film for a big reason. This is one of few films in which you are actively rooting for the ""bad guys"". This is simply done by giving the viewers the perspective of both Bonnie and Clyde. If the side of the authorities was given, the audience would be rooting for authority. Throughout the film, I knew I probably shouldn't be showing sympathy for the duo but it's really hard not to as you grow closer to them throughout. I enjoyed the variety of settings throughout the film as Bonnie and Clyde travelled around and destroyed on any lives although I thought the driving scenes weren't perfectly done in terms of realism. The ending was very dramatic and a perfect/shocking solution. In terms of the film's form, I noticed many close ups which isn't typically seen in many films. Overall I thought this was a great film due to the different perspective in the classic ""good guy vs. bad guy"" films.",Bonnie and Clyde
243,ninabruzdzinski,Loved this,8,25 April 2016,"I feel like this film is such a classic and popular film I couldn't believe I hadn't seen it before. In high school, I read the play version of it but the film outdoes it by a million percent. It was fast paced and action packed, making watching it wonderful. I found my heart racing during the bank robbery scene, urging the five robbers to get out of there. Even though they are all technically criminals, my heart sank a little at the end. I think a really great film has just that ability. The ability to show the audience that sometimes people are bad, and they do bad things, but a really great film makes you root for the bad guys, makes you want the bad guys to get away from the good guys and live happily ever after. A really great film makes you sad to see the bad guys die.",Bonnie and Clyde
244,k-ellinger,Thriller.,8,14 April 2016,"Everyone has heard the story of Bonnie and Clyde. They are the two most notorious killers of the early 1900's. Their story was so famous that it was made into this action packed movie, which features Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway. This movie is a mixture of love and violence. This movie happened to come out shortly after the Hayes Code was broken so the audience was in for a ride when the movie came out in theaters. With the lack of violence in movies before this movie, the audience are in for a surprise to see something like this on the big screen. One of the most notable scenes was the scene where they got shot up. It was extremely violent and could be shocking for viewers to watch.",Bonnie and Clyde
245,CriticalViewing,"The violence we see today, shown in 1967",6,10 May 2016,"The violence in this film is explicit. There have been many other violent films, or films with striking violent acts, prior to it, such as Scarface (1932) and Psycho (1960 ; the shower scene, the scene when the detective enters the house, etc.). In Scarface, the gunshots were never ""seen"", they had only been heard. And in Scarface's closing scene, we see the shots hit their target, but we don't see excessive amounts of blood, similar to the two Psycho scenes I mentioned (the blood is minimal). But in Bonnie and Clyde, director Penn opened up the flood gates!! Also, notably in the film, we see sexual elements, including a sexually frustrated Bonnie (a woman having and showing desires!). At the time, in the 60s sexuality was still somewhat taboo. But in the counterculture movement, it became something that was latched onto. Either in explicit or implicit (discussion) terms, which was seen in other 1967 films The Graduate, and, Guess Who's Coming To Dinner. Bonnie and Clyde was also excessive in other areas as well, but they weren't painted as monsters. We see the laughs, a few tears, and love that Bonnie and Clyde had for each other as people. And the joy they had and those who associated with them had, such as Clyde's brother. They were people first, just people who happened to commit many crimes is all. O, and also kill people.",Bonnie and Clyde
246,hiproductions,"Great acting, great directing, one flaw but overall good movie",5,27 May 2005,"This is clearly one of the better pictures to come out of the sixties. Arthur Penn was able to bring an audience to a place of identification with notorious robbers and murderers.The casting of this film was the greatest feat. I'm not a big Warren Beatty fan but he really scored big in this movie. He did a great job convincing me that he was THE Clyde Barrows and Faye Dunaway was great as ""Bonnie"". I am a big Gene Hackman fan and I believe his role as supporting actor in this was phenomenal (he usually is).I took the cinematography for granted until I started to remember that this was 1967 and really ground breaking for that time. The person chasing the getaway car was blasted directly in the face and the scene at the end when they're riddled with bullets also had not been seen before (to my knowledge). Both must have been huge shockers to audiences of that day.Arthur Penn did a great job in keeping my interest by telling a story and not just relaying events like a newscaster or trying to get creative by cutting a ""semi"" bio/crime pic into pieces and forcing on the viewers as an ensemble.I did notice one area that could have been improved in my opinion. There were no real villain characters to fear. This was the same problem with ""I Am A Fugitive From a Chain gang"". This picture had no real identifiable villain character just a conglomerate of faceless policemen and a 20 second scene with a Texas Ranger. He could have possibly brought more out in the Ranger guy and made us know him and hate him or fear him more so that we could identify more with Bonnie and Clyde.Aside from this one very minor imperfection, this was a splendid movie.",Bonnie and Clyde
247,b-mooney,Brave directing,9,15 December 2009,"I noticed right away that the first shot of the movie was especially long. It is a good way of getting to know the characters and portraying their meeting in real time. It is also risky for a director because it has to be perfect the entire time. A lot of the movie took place in a car and it depicted how trapped they were in their lives. This movie came out the same year that the production codes were dropped and it is apparent in the excess violence and nudity. Additionally, two people who were not married had sex which was unheard of before this time period. The acting was so awesome and it really gave the viewer a sense of what was going on inside the minds of Bonnie and Clyde. It made me feel sorry for them and I was absolutely horrified at the end when they put about 20 bullets in Bonnie. I was like...SHE'S DEAD ALREADY STOP. I did like the ending even though it was difficult to watch.",Bonnie and Clyde
248,a-ferrera,"Good movie, groundbreaking!",9,12 December 2011,"I really enjoyed this movie. Warren Beaty's performance is very good although the appearance of his character is almost not believable. He is almost too handsome in this role to be believed as a criminal. His good looks also make it hard to believe that he is ""not a lady's man."" Faye Dunaway is also really good in this movie. She plays the kind of girl that would follow a man like Clyde as soon as she met him really well and makes such a ridiculous thing believable. Her image is also great for this role.This movie was also very ground breaking for it's time, the time of ""New Hollywood."" It broke many taboos that movies before it never came close to. It was one of the first movies to break the three second kissing rule, as well as showing sex on screen which was not done before then on screen.",Bonnie and Clyde
249,StaticScreen,bonnie and Clyde,7,30 November 2011,"Bonnie and Clyde tells the story of two vigilantes who go around the country robbing banks with their friends and escaping the law enforcement that are always right on their tail. The story is somewhat compelling, letting you see inside their lives. But, the story was definitely stretched out beyond believability, in one scene they get shot by cops, and one of the members takes a bullet to the head. They still manage to load him onto the car and escape from them easily. The southern drawl and hillbilly-esque of the characters made this movie really strange to me. There is some nice country land shots throughout, and a guest appearance by Gene Wilder! By no means a home run, just a mildly entertaining and overall satisfactory movie about hillbillies who rob banks.",Bonnie and Clyde
250,dfiscaletti8,review for Bonnie and Clyde,6,30 November 2012,"Everyone knows the classic Bonnie and Clyde; it is a pastime favorite by many. To my surprise I found this movie interesting as it incorporated the mixture of romance and action, however it was very overdramatized which is something I do not particularly enjoy. Both Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway did an impressive job portraying their characters, as they seemed to fill every attribute of the real Bonnie and Clyde themselves. I found this love story a little different due to Clyde's hesitation and display of emotions, but it was something different that I found somewhat interesting. The action had its positives and negatives. For example being able to see the ""behind the scenes"" of a robbery was interesting and it did not exaggerate the lifestyle of a thief. By showing every aspect of Bonnie and Clyde's life from the fighting, to the love making it makes the story come alive and gave it a good sense of verisimilitude. However this was shortly taken away by the many gunshot scenes. It seemed as if there was a noisy over dramatized gunshot scene every 5 minutes, this was unnecessary as it took away from the movie. In my opinion Arthur Penn was a little too excited when it came to the guns and should have focused more on the story. Despite the over use of the gun scenes, especially in the end with the unrealistic and even disturbing death scene I did enjoy that the loves Bonnie and Clyde died together supporting the romantic aspect of the film making it seem as if their love would go on forever",Bonnie and Clyde
251,v-colarusso,Our first taste of violence,9,5 May 2013,"This movie was important in that it twisted all of the social norms that cinema had showcased up until now. It was, of course, made during the very end of the Hayes code and the beginning of the American cultural revolution. The same year of The Graduate. The violence was excessive and gave the American people something that they didn't know they had been craving. Ever since, violent movies have been a stronghold and directors who focus on violence have been well-received. It's a bold statement, but this film may be one of the (if not the one) catalyst to America's love for violence. It took on a different perception of crime as had been portrayed in movies past. The audience finds itself rooting for Bonnie and Clyde to get away. Their life of crime is shown in such a lighthearted way that it seems almost attractive. I enjoyed this film very much.",Bonnie and Clyde

It was an independent film that was not projected to work and eventually grossed over 70 million dollars. That alone is so cool. Besides all that the movie is great. Super violent at parts and I love it. I cannot imagine how people would have reacted. The end scene of this movie is them pulling over to help this guy and it just doesn't seem right. Then they have a bunch of beautiful quick takes back and forth of bonnie and clyde as they realize what has happened. That alone was intense. Then they are shot about, I don't know, seven thousand times.

The film however boasts a strong cast of talented actors, and each is wonderful in the roles they play. I really enjoyed the chemistry between Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway; they really brought something unique to the screen. The film has some decent robbery sequences, but where the film delivers is when the Barrows Gang has a few shootouts with the Law. Bonnie and Clyde is a thrilling crime film that's definitely a classic of film, and one of the best gangster action films of the 60's. The gang also was portrayed as somewhat friendly as well, yet they were hardened killers in real life.

255,Amym-24,Good Crime Film to Watch,9,15 December 2009,"It's sad how in times of the recession, people will do anything to obtain money, food, and cars, even if it means stealing it from their owners and physically hurting them for their goods.Stealing items doesn't get an individual anywhere in life. Stealing goods will only put themselves in prison and mentally hurting themselves for getting themselves into this horrible life of crime. It's important for people to receive an education, attend college, and earn money in a well paying job that they'll be happy working at and not have to steal money for a living.Bonnie and Clyde is a good film that shows how dangerous stealing money from banks in order to earn a living really is in life. Individuals that steal from other people have to serve the consequences for committing their crime, even if it means death and punishment. The use of the camera clicking sound with the photos of the actors and actresses in the opening credits was used well. The use of the natural lighting for the majority of the film was great. The natural lighting and focus in Bonnie's family reunion was very soft in focus. The lighting in the night driving scenes are shot well. The bird's eye view of Clyde running through the field towards Bonnie was shot well. The long take of the bullet holes that were inside the car was filmed well and brought the film to a dramatic end.Although the film was bloody at times, the screenplay and the acting throughout the film were excellent. If you're interested in violent, crime dramas, then this film is great to watch.",Bonnie and Clyde
256,fauxface,"thrilling romance, destined for death",9,16 December 2009,"One of the conflicts in this film is between Bonnie and self. In the beginning of the film, she debates whether to leave her mother and her boring life and join Clyde or to stay put and stay safe. Clyde convinces her that if she resents her job as a waitress and the dates with boys that just want to sleep with her, that she should accompany him. It doesn't take much persuasion before she agrees with him and sacrifices her old life for a life of excitement.Another conflict seen in Bonnie and Clyde is the way of living chosen by the Barrow gang clashing with the restrictions of the law. The law enforcement is constantly trying to capture the group of robbers. The gang is evading every attempt until finally they kill Buck and gain custody of his wife, are led to C.W.'s house where they conspire with C.W.'s father to trap Bonnie and Clyde to kill them, and arrest C.W. The film was set during the Great Depression in the Midwest, ranging from Oklahoma to Texas. The gang runs in and out of small towns and spends their nights in cabins, squatting in abandoned houses, or camping in fields. The time has a tremendous effect on the characters. During the Great Depression, many people could not pay back loans to the banks and lost their houses and possessions. These people regarded the Barrow gang as heroes for having the courage to take the money back from the bank. Also, having an endless supply of free money was appealing to Bonnie during these especially hard times, and aided in her decision to join Clyde. Because Bonnie and Clyde were so removed from society, it helped to form their dependence on one another. Another effect of their situation was being constantly in close proximity with the other members of their group. This frustrates Bonnie and causes her to resent her partners even more because she just wants to be alone with Clyde. The most prominent symbol comes early in the film. The day that Bonnie and Clyde first meet and are drinking sodas in town, Clyde shows Bonnie his handgun. The way he is holding it at his hips and how she reaches out to touch it transforms the gun into a phallic symbol. This means that her attraction to Clyde is dangerous.Another symbol from the film is the constantly changing cars. This shows the free spirited nature of Clyde, and how he loves to search for new and exciting things. When Bonnie says ""But this is the car we came in!"" and Clyde responds ""That doesn't mean that's the one we have to leave in"". This illustrates how they have endless possibilities and no restrictions. Whatever they want, they can take. One theme of this film is publicity. Everyone knows about Bonnie and Clyde, the famous bank robbers of the Barrow Gang. Newspapers were constantly referenced and people treated Bonnie and Clyde like stars. When the gang stole the car of Eugene Grizzard, played by Gene Wilder, Eugene and his girlfriend Velma were excited to find it was them and enjoyed spending the night driving around and getting burgers with the group. Bonnie and Clyde loved to be in the public eye, and introduced themselves to everyone when they were stealing. Bonnie had her picture taken with the Texas sheriff to have it sent to the newspapers and published. This was a punishment for him for traveling out of his jurisdiction to hunt them when the Barrow gang thought that he should be in Texas, protecting the poor. The picture showed Bonnie kissing the sheriff and Clyde standing beside them smiling. This created a bad image for the sheriff and he lost his credibility because of it.Bonnie also had her poetry published in the newspapers. She wanted everyone to know the truth about the group, about her love for Clyde, and the story of their lives. She wanted to let people know that they were good people who were on the wrong side of the law. They killed people and knew it wasn't right, but it's what they needed to do to survive because when they were caught, they would die.Although I prefer movies that are shorter and more concise, I would recommend this movie to most of my friends. I enjoyed the story and the pacing of the plot. Sympathizing with the villains and telling their story through their point of view is something that has never been done before this time, due to the Hays Code. Because of this, it makes the film an important stepping stone in cinematic history.This is a film that could be watched at anytime. It would suit the mood for a romance, comedy, crime, thriller, or drama. The cast performs brilliantly, with the exception of Gene Wilder who is not so convincing and ruins the verisimilitude, however seeing a film with Gene Wilder is a treat in itself, no matter the context.",Bonnie and Clyde

Although it is over 40 years old, the film has a very modern feel to it. Full of blood and violence, Bonnie and Clyde broke through many barriers. The film lead the audience to sympathize and understand these ruthless killers; something that was not allowed during the era of the Hays code.The acting of Dunaway and Beatty, as well as the supporting cast is flawless. The action is nearly constant, and it was paced very well with some comedy mixed in. After this film that mixing is something that becomes more common.

I had heard of this movie before, but never watched it. I didn't realize that it wasn't just Bonnie and Clyde, that there were more people involved. At times it was really funny, especially with the music, and other times I really felt sorry for the characters, especially after hearing Bonnie's poem that she sent the newspapers.

The costumes really allow the audience's imagination to flow towards the time period being portrayed. The film gives an adrenaline rush that is so natural; it takes you back a bit. I feel as though many people like this film because it is not realistic, it is sort of fantasy.However, the costumes and the simplistic nature of the film itself allows for audiences to forget that it is indeed fantasy. sooner before later, you are caught on the ride. You forget about the realism and your mind is stimulated off of the thoughts of something like this actually happening. The fact that love is thrown in the mix creates for an immediate attention grabber. This movie incorporates love and tons of action and violence. this captures not only women but men as well. great flick!",Bonnie and Clyde

The end death scene of Bonnie and Clyde, is something that truly broke the mold in Hollywood, in that there had never really been such a violent and graphic death scene/sequence prior to this film. Another mold that this film seemed to ultimately break was the mold of violence and sex in a film, in that Bonnie and Clyde were seen not only on the bed at the same time, but also had a rather scandalous ""sex"" scene for this time period.",Bonnie and Clyde
263,cjlance8,Bonnie and Clyde Review,10,13 May 2015,Bonnie and Clyde directed by Arthur Penn was a great crime/drama movie. This movie was made in 1967 and was in the year when many great films were made. The Graduate and Guess Whose Coming To Dinner were also made in this year and they are all considered some of the greatest movies of all time. It was exciting throughout and kept you on the edge of your seat during the whole thing. The time period was in the 1930's and Penn made it look exactly like it was that time. He recreated the Great Depression feel and look 30 years later. It was excellent. The ending of the movie was also very good. The camera is used at many different angles. They stop on the side of the road and eventually walk right into their death. The camera quickly cuts between both of their faces before they get shot. Then it is just silent with their bodies rolling around as they are dying. It was a perfect way to an already crazy movie. I loved it.,Bonnie and Clyde

After almost 50 years this movie is still regarded as one of the great movies made in the 60's. It helped end the Hays Code by challenging it with the violence it portrayed throughout. The movie isn't all about the violence of Bonnie and Clyde's but the love they had for each other. I especially liked the way the movie captured the 1940's depression era style throughout the film. I also thought the acting by Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway was exceptional as they really portrayed the characters well and showed the emotions necessary to portray their love. It was also cool to see Gene Hackman during his early years of acting.,Bonnie and Clyde

266,c-stewart-44611,Movie Review: HIST of American Cinema,10,27 November 2020,"""Bonnie and Clyde"" is a classic film directed by Arthur Penn starring Faye Dunaway, Warren Beatty, and Michael J. Pollard. This movie takes a love story, and combines it with intense action to tell the story of Bonnie and Clyde. The chemistry between Warren Beatty as Clyde, and Faye Dunaway as Bonnie was obvious from the very first scenes of the movie. There was lots of car chases and shootouts that kept you on the edge of your seat, as well as some heartfelt scenes that showed that Bonnie and Clyde also had compassion. Even though the story of Bonnie and Clyde is well known, throughout the movie you kept wondering if they were going to get caught, or get away from the law. What I think made this film so good is the use of great shooting locations, set props, and authentic cars from the 1920s. It really made it believable that this was shot in the 20s and not the 60s. The all-star cast made this a believable and entertaining movie that gave an overview of Bonnie and Clyde's story.",Bonnie and Clyde
267,markfinelli,The Bank Robbers,10,16 November 2020,"I would recommend this movie to anyone. It really is a great movie that puts you in the shoes of the bank robbers. Bonnie and Clyde is a great criminal movie.It is the ultimate ""boyfriend and girlfriend,"" in a team as criminals. They rob banks during the great depression. It was a true love story between the two once they met when Clyde tried to steal Bonnie's mother's car. Bonnie was very intrigued by Clyde and what he had been doing. He began to bring her along on the crimes he did, and later they became a team. In the beginning, it was only small type crimes, but after eventually getting a whole team together they end up doing quite a bit of damage to the southwest. They hated banks and other places that had made money because they were doing so bad financially. These include shootings and stealing cars.The ending will shock you and it's something that had never been done before in movies. This movie brought a whole different level of sex and crimes to the tv screens.",Bonnie and Clyde
268,jamesfalace,The famous love story,9,10 December 2020,"This film follows the story of the infamous criminal couple of Bonnie and Clyde during the Great Depression. This movie portrayed 2 of the most iconic people to ever live and it didn't disappoint. The directors of this move did a lot of creative shots that I found interesting such a close up through the reflection of the window that Bonnie looks through, and the scene where Bonnie has target practice with the tire swing to name 2 of them. Other scenes include close ups which show the emotion of the character throughout the course of the film, pan shots, and some jump cuts. The lighting used in this film is mostly natural lighting from the sun which I personally favor over other types of lighting because it gives me a sense of realness instead of the actors being in a studio like nowadays. There's not much music being played and mostly just the sound of the characters whether they talking or shooting. Overall this criminal type of film captures an amazing story and has a good amount of action involved to thoroughly entertain me",Bonnie and Clyde
269,james-m-donohue,Great movie that changed how people saw crime movies.,9,16 December 2009,"Bonnie and Clyde is a true story about the famous criminal couple. The cinematography uses specific shots to create a mise-en-scene with a great use of establishing shots that give a sense of place and surrounding. It is easy to feel like you are with them watching this in an open field on a crowded street. The lighting isn't extraordinary because it tries to create a fairly realistic sense of lighting, which benefits the movie by making it feel very real. The acting is great. All performances by the main characters make the characters interesting. Even the actors who play stand in roles are entertaining.The lack of music and dependence on diagetic sound makes the movie feel very real as well. Probably the times when music is used is during chase scenes where fast bluegrass acoustic music is being played to make the scene feel fun as a sort of distraction while building up a brief climax until the scene is over.The character development in the story is also very good and fast moving making a bathroom break impossible without the ability to pause. The narrative combined with this makes it easy to understand the storyline while feeling complex.The scenes where innocent people die or are robbed feel very dark while feeling quick to add to the dread that comes from what isn't really a simple crime.This movie is also very quotable, which is a plus. If you are looking for a great movie from the late 60's that sets up people's acceptance of The Godfather then this is it.",Bonnie and Clyde
270,GordJackson,A Gruesome Twosome!,4,30 April 2016,"I wish I could get on the 'we love ""Bonnie and Clyde""' bandwagon. But I cannot. I found its paint-by-numbers storytelling style boring and predictable. Based upon the lives of depression-era criminals Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, the film routinely shows us how they met, lived and eventually came to their undignified doom. Certainly, the Oscar winning colour cinematography of Burnett Guffey is breathtaking, the recreation of the thirties depression era superb, an excellent musical score adds immeasurably to the film's ambiance and the acting of the supporting characters is stellar. Sadly however, that's it for me. I found Warren Beatty's Clyde Barrow was forced and unconvincing, with Faye Dunaway's Bonnie Parker less depression thirties than hippie sixties. Unfortunately, I also did not see much in the way of on screen chemistry between the two leads. For me they were more like a couple of limp lettuce well past their best before date. Only Gene Hackman's good-old-boy brother Buck, Estelle Parsons near- hysterical wife Blanche, and most especially Michael J. Pollard's quirky C. W. Moss add any spark to their characters. ""Bonnie and Clyde"" is not exactly a time waster, but do also check out Joseph H. Lewis's 1949 black and white, totally fictional cheapie ""Gun Crazy"" for a vastly more satisfying take on the B & C story. For this commentator it is far more interesting, with the on screen chemistry of Peggy Cummins' Laurie Starr and John Dahl's Bart Tare threatening to ignite everything around them. Indeed, total conflagration in the Lewis film may only have been avoided because the director had to sanitize his movie past the prissy Hays office. No, ""Gun Crazy"" may not have the opulence or graphic violence of the Arthur Penn/WarrenBeatty (who produced) collaboration, but it makes up for it in so many other ways.",Bonnie and Clyde
271,m-visker,Bonnie and Clyde the fatal duo,8,8 May 2014,"These are two names that I have known forever and knew the brief story behind them but never took the time to watch the classic movie. This movie was filmed after the Hays code and was consider part of the New Hollywood Era of movies. One major thing that this movie did that wouldn't have been acceptable during the code era was the glorification of violence through out the story. This movie really showed the people being killed suffer, and it wasn't a short gunshot and boom, died. Yet even though we watch this couple kill countless people we, the audience, still root for these two and hope they get away. And when we are proved wrong we sympathized with these two people in the end when they were killed. The scene of their murder is also shot very well, the camera is constantly changing shots from Bonnie back to Clyde, showing both of them being shot multiply times, some shots in slow-mo, only to add more drama to the scene. It is funny how a movie can make two lethal people so likely-able, and even though in the end they get what they deserve for commenting so many sins, we still find ourselves sad and wishing: only if they got away.",Bonnie and Clyde

The film is good at making you feel as if these characters might have decency in them, but you realize that this duo are all about the money. The film was made during New Hollywood, and is definitely progressive. It has sexual scenes, and a high amount of violence, and blood. The editing in this film was slightly strange, as I felt it 'jumped' at times. The film was fun to watch and the characters Bonnie and Clyde were both great film antiheroes.

Considered to be one of the greatest gangster films of all time.Bonnie and Clyde is considered a landmark film, and is regarded as one of the first films of the New Hollywood era, since it broke many cinematic taboos and was popular with the younger generation, and is credited for being one of the first films to dismantle the Hays Code. For some members of the counterculture, the film was considered to be a ""rallying cry."" Its success prompted other filmmakers to be more open in presenting sex and violence in their films.

The cinematography is beautiful and makes this film even more memorable. As I've mentioned before, memorable ingredients to your film make it well-known and iconic. As soon as you hear the names Bonnie and Clyde, your ears perk up. Knowing that this film is based off of real life events, it pulls you in even further.

I loved how crisp the color was; everything was heightened in terms of color, the cuts in the film were a little too much in my opinion but other than that, the angles were very well done to get everything in the picture. The acting was done well, it wasn't too much but it wasn't too little either. I like how there was a significant difference in lighting whether they were inside or outside.",Bonnie and Clyde
276,revtg1-3,Change all the names and it is an almost good movie,3,26 May 2012,"Shortly after the movie was released it was screened for a former member of the Barrow gang. His comment: ""I don't know who that movie was supposed to be about, but it sure as hell was not about Clyde Barrow."" There are four things factual in the movie. There really was a Clyde Barrow. There really was a Bonnie Parker. There really was a Frank Hamer. Hamer was one of the ambushers. Other than that it is just another James Cagney gangster movie without Cagney. Total fabrication. Total. Barrow was sent to a brutal Texas prison for a minor crime where he suffered homosexual rape. He murdered the man who did it and when he was released from prison he swore he would come back, break IN and free all the prisoners. And he did. That would have made the movie more interesting.An interesting note: Denver Pyle played Frank Hamer (a Texas Ranger who once said he had killed 50 men, not counting Mexicans) as an inept and almost comical oaf. After members of Hamer's family saw the movie they sued the producers for enough money to buy Texas and give it back to the Comanches. And won. Every other actual person portrayed in the movie was equally misrepresented. Penn was honored for the movie. He should have been tarred and feathered and dumped in downtown Dallas.",Bonnie and Clyde

I feel it would of been better if it was the other way around but that not important. I rather enjoyed the way that the first person clyde shot died it isn't as graphic as modern movies are, it was enough to be believable which is why i enjoyed it. The way the movie ended was sad because no matter how much people hate crime in a way the theory of having Bonnie and Clyde get away and live happily would make the viewer smile a little for the simple fact that as the movie went on Bonnie and Clyde became more and more likable.",Bonnie and Clyde
278,l-seidel,good stuff,6,7 May 2014,"Bonnie and Clyde, while a classic, is not without flaw. Maybe it's my position of having knowledge decades into the future, but I felt like the movie was struggling to figure out exactly what it wanted to be. I saw inklings of what was done in later films in the same genre (the idea of rooting for the criminal, the mix of comedy with callous killing) but I felt like for each moment they embraced these things, they took two steps back somewhere else. The ending certainly doesn't match up with how we were being made to feel about our protagonists, which could have everything to do with the time it was made. You could almost feel like the movie didn't want to fall into the narrative of Bonnie, Clyde and the other characters deserving death and an unhappy ending, yet that is what we got. It left me rather confused in how I was supposed to feel, but it was a fun film that I definitely enjoyed watching all the same.",Bonnie and Clyde
279,Mustaveli,Amusing Comedy,8,13 December 2014,"A touching movie, and not just entirely about the romantic emotional state. It was very violent, and pushed beyond the limits. I feel that the film was trying to lure us in with it's emotional cast, even through the humor. Honestly, they did a good job at it. It's kind of adorable that the director took on a bored couple, and had them go to the extremes. It does happy in real life, even to that extreme perhaps. Boredom is truly a dangerous thing, and I was rather sad when I experienced the ending. However, you did get the feeling that it was going to happen.

Together they go on the run committing many crimes as they avoid the authorities.The only I thought worth notable about the making of the film was the violence being portrayed, especially one of the last scene where Bonnie and Clyde are shot dead. This scene was quite vicious and almost over done (overkill...) The scene was still beautiful which was shocking to the audience because no one had ever really scene violence glorified in films before. While being shot to death like Swiss cheese, there were some moments that shifted back and forth to slow motion which really glorified the scene in many ways but ultimately got the reaction it deserved.

Great dramatic but realistic lighting, and the sounds of the tommy guns really made this feel like a true ""gangster"" film.I would have liked to see more variation within the plot, as what happens is pretty straightforward, but I suppose they wanted to keep it somewhat true to the way it happened.This film nailed the action, but also used the slower portions well to deepen character.The last scene was also done really well.

283,Travis69,Bonnie and Clyde review,8,12 October 2003,"If humor doesn't cut it, intimacy will. 1967's Bonnie and Clyde is one of the exceedingly superb forefathers to sadistic comedy films, otherwise known as dark comedies and black humor. The banjo that accompanies each bank robbery, and car chase scene-a must for an action flick nowadays (see this past summer's sequels)-delivers the flippant touch needed to care about Bonnie (Faye Dunaway) and Clyde (Warren Beatty)'s shameless deeds. Unfortunately, characters like C.W. Moss and Buck don't pack quite the humoristic punch needed in order for the black humor to work in full. The movie itself is great, largely due to the wise cinematography that earned Bonnie and Clyde an Academy Award.Right from the jump the camera is focused on Bonnie's puckering lips. Many close-ups include focusing on Clyde's wondrous eyes and the expressions through reaction shots the two semi-lovebirds dictate. I say semi. because this movie lands some of the most uncomfortable, even pathetic, love-`making' scenes in film's history. Clyde's bedroom skills don't quite match up to his stallion-ish appearance. You know something is wrong when Warren Beatty-the Tom Cruise of his time-comes up a bit short. Despite, the camera does its job in allowing the audience to see what the characters are thinking, right smack on the face. Another similar fixture in the film is the use of blatant silence to escort awkward moments, such as the aforementioned bedroom scenes in addition to any anxiousness or unawareness Bonnie and Clyde feel in the mist of action.Bonnie and Clyde is similar to Adam and Eve in that the grainy haystack palette matches the characters' appearance. The yellows represent that tragic feel that Bonnie and Clyde are meshing with their environment. It doesn't hurt that the two share an apple in the film's final minutes, either.Many cynics will agree that there is a profusion of historical inaccuracies in the fabricated true-telling of Bonnie and Clyde. This is why films are called exploitations or adaptations; they contain a prime base for story structure, with the rest left up to the director. Bonnie and Clyde's director, Arthur Penn, does a wonderful job in communicating the implicit values and societal issues from this true story onto the big screen. While some of Bonnie and Clyde's grandkids may have taken many of the film's themes a bit far (Natural Born Killers, The Wild Bunch), there is proof that desperate times call for desperate measures, even when you know the easy way out will eventually cost you-and your loved one's-own fate.

284,paleowildchild,Loved this film,10,13 May 2021,"Bonny and Clyde was the best crime movie I have ever seen! The whole time you know how it's going to end, and yet you are so wrapped up in the character's lives and love stories that you never want it to end.The casting was excellent! Estelle Parsons was the perfect annoying sister-in-law, and Faye Dunaway was amazing as Bonny.The film had a very western feel to it, and not because it was set in the midwest but because the main characters were on the run.",Bonnie and Clyde
285,griffinsnyder,This is a stick-up,5,7 May 2021,"This movie was okay. It had aspects that I really enjoyed, like the very beginning with the photographs. It reminded me of Texas Chainsaw Massacre and gave off a very horror movie-like vibe. I also liked that the media was crediting Bonnie and Clyde with numerous robberies that they themselves did not commit, yet they were happy to take the credit for. That all being said, certain aspects were far from these, such as the initial shootout with the entire gang. That was just silly, and to have the wife running around in the streets screaming when police are everywhere was just stupid. I also wish there was more conflict in Bonnie prior to joining up with Clyde. She does have difficulty with it at first and at a few points throughout the movie, but I feel these could all be closer together and really show her distress. Separating them so much and having her happily go along with these heinous acts in between just feels off.",Bonnie and Clyde
286,AlexCWM,Thrilling if Not Accurate,9,28 April 2021,"Bonnie and Clyde takes the viewer on an incredibly exciting journey. The film is not historically accurate, no, but it doesn't claim to be. The lives of Bonnie and Clyde are romanticized in this retelling, postured as fun-loving adrenaline junkies that never slow down.The casting in Bonnie and Clyde seems great. The characters in this film are very dramatic and surprisingly complex which comes across perfectly. The chemistry between Bonnie and Clyde is obvious and the unique relationship dynamic of a couple on the run is incredibly fun.For its time, the violence in this movie is surprising. The violence is almost unsettling, even to a lover of gore and action like myself, and it really helps tell the story in an intense and engaging way.",Bonnie and Clyde

Its a little know fact but when Eugene Grizzard's girl friend says she 35 in the back of the car and Eugene looks at her with such disgust and confusion. The one moment in the movie makes up for Warren Beatty's horrible acting as a soft criminal who throughout the movie can't seem to do his manly duty for Bonnie. Now don't get me wrong I do enjoy this movie because of its light hearted romp through America on a violent crime spree. If you enjoy crime dramas but don't necessarily like the dark grittiness of a noir style movie then this movie is perfect because in between moments of drama there are feel good scenes that can be quite humorous.,Bonnie and Clyde

290,chrisj893,A Landmark,9,10 November 2009,"Bonnie and Clyde (1967) is a beautiful film made great by a powerful cast and superb writing. The first scene of the movie, the one which Bonnie and Clyde are seen walking through town, sets the scene for the rest of the film. Two complimentary, yet so different characters that work so well together. Various things struck me in this movie as different. For one this is the first film from this era that i've seen to have any sexual prowess, it is refreshing yet at the same time, a foreshadow for trash films to come. Something that comes to mind is the great color and texture of the early Technicolor films. The outdoor, on location scenes are so beautiful and provide so much sense of reality to the viewer. The sky is so blue, and the trees so green. It is interesting to see how the movies of the 50s and 60s fuse modern ideas with the old school glamor and shine. These two decades are very, very important for modern day film making. The scripts were finally opened up to include more modern ideas and modern writing. Warren Beatty's performance is stunning, as he fuses the boyhood hero with the ""mans man"". Overall this is a great landmark film for any movie watcher.",Bonnie and Clyde

The themes of the film such as obsession with celebrity, bonds of love, rebellion, and the Robin Hood concept, are investigated but never construe the enjoyment of watching it. This movie has many different feelings to it. Such as it's funny, shocking, sad, frightening, luring, and debatable.

I never understood why people would want to glamorize such evil. Thank goodness for the recent Netflix film ""The Highwaymen"" for finally setting the record straight about the real-life Texas Rangers who hunted down and killed those psychopaths.
Arthur Penn portrayed Ranger Hamer as a incompetent red-necked fool by casting bucktoothed comedic actor Denver Pyle in the role. And Hamer's wife successfully sued for defamation of character. The choice of Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway was phoney as well. In real life, both Bonnie and Clyde were little sawed-off squirts and not the beautiful and almost regal characters we see on the screen.
Warren Beatty went on later to glamorize another psychotic killer in the film ""Bugsy"". But this is to be expected from a draft-dodging coward who deliberately got a dishonorable discharge from the California Air National Guard in January 1961, making him ineligible for any future military service.

But at its core, it's a story about the desire for a better life (as defined by the Individual) a more fulfilling purpose in life. A longing for a better use of one's life. Desire for another person sexually? Yes, that is evident in the film but it is clearly more than physical desire that keeps these two ""losers"" together. There is a very beautiful scene in the film, which lasts only seconds. It's at the end of the film, just before the death scene. Can you recall it? Do you know the scene? My guess is you do as the scene has stuck with me for many years. It's the ""look"" scene where Bonnie and Clyde look into each other's eyes Right before their bodies are riddled with bullets, knowing it's the last time they will ever see each other. Recognition of their other Self perhaps. Then death. The end of longing. The end of desire.",Bonnie and Clyde

The two look at each other as they realise they have been set-up and in one of acting's finest moments give each other a knowing smile.  In that one moment they convey all the emotions that make up their characters.  The love of their excitement-ridden lifestyle, knowing that this is just another part in the game that is their lives.  The love of each other, wanting to be together even in death.  The fact that they both know that the poem Bonnie wrote came true to the letter and that the last line was being written in that very moment.  The fact that despite what Bonnie had insinuated earlier in the film, they wouldn't have changed their lives for anything.  A moment of true, complete and astounding love.

Then had some fade in and outs which I liked. I was shocked to see a sign in front of the house that said citizen bank, is that how long they have been around? When they were shooting at the sign and the windows I think the noise was a little over bearing what to dramatic. I noticed in one scene that bonnie is leaning against Clyde and when the camera shot changes she is not. that happened about 3 times. I was also shocked to see that when they robbed one of the banks that they shot a man right in the face. I didn't expect that at all. I thought it was interesting that they were keeping people with them instead of just traveling by themselves.

Not only was it very popular when it came out, but it still gets brought up today and many use it as a reference. The movie entails a crazy couple who mass murders basically random people while they are on the run. It definitely gets a little brutal and was hard to watch at sometimes, but it really is an awesome movie. Always has kind of reminded me of that Harley Quinn and Joker relationship.

Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty were fantastic as the infamous crime duo; their ability to be humorous without sacrificing the violence that lies at the core of the film is one of the reasons that it remains a masterpiece today. This violence is not veiled by director Arthur Penn. Along with sex, it is portrayed explicitly, and is perfectly accentuated by the bleakness of a Depression-era setting as well as by sparing dialogue between the characters. This film was an amazing mix of dark humor, violence and struggle. One can't help almost sympathizing with the Barrow gang; although they are murderous thrill seekers, they are somewhat likable, and their love story is incredibly captivating.

It's two mass murders on the loose killing many incessant people for no reason just for the passion of killing people. The way they killed people was brutal, they would pull over on a long empty road acting like their car was broken down and whoever came to help them was their target. They are known for being on the run for many years. One thing about them is they didn't like to be too far from home so they murders accrued around certain area's. They were drawing massive attention from the media and locals. I thought this film could've been better because the actors looked boring and underplayed through out the whole film.

The final scene, where Bonnie and Clyde are both shot countless times, is a monumental moment in cinema. It showed that the main characters do not always have to survive the film, and it upended the audience's expectations of what the film would be.",Bonnie and Clyde
302,brainyidiot,"entertaining, but factually inaccurate",5,20 September 2005,"The real Bonnie and Clyde were neither glamorous or attractive. And they were largely unknown nationally until their violent deaths. One day alone during Bonnie's funeral, 20,000 people visited the funeral home where she laid in state and was mostly condemned by those who attended it out of curiosity as being the ruthless murderers they in fact were. No real Robin Hood types as glamorized by this film. The FBI was in its early days plagued by ineptness and disorganization. Plus many local police agencies were corrupt and uncooperative in their dealings with them. This movie takes great liberties with their portrayal of these uneducated white trash brutal criminals. If you want to know the actual facts, read the fascinating book ""Public Enemies"" by Bryan Burrough. It tells the 2 year story of the early days of the FBI, Bonnie and Clyde, Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, and the Barker Gang-among other bank robbers of the day. While this movie may work as entertainment, the true story of Bonnie and Clyde will sicken you.",Bonnie and Clyde
303,CaptainCutie,Really liked this,8,5 December 2016,"I really enjoyed the movie Bonnie and Clyde it was a great film packed with action, adventure, romance and drama throughout the whole thing. This film did a great job of keeping its audience at the edge of their seats and watching with a lot of interest. Many parts of this film show aspects of new Hollywood and how the rules and regulations for filmmaking is changing. One big thing that is definitely new Hollywood is the ending scene with all the shooting, if that scene had been shot when the hays code was still going on this film never would have made it to theaters. With the film Bonnie and Clyde I thought that the meaning of this film was great and just really enjoyed the whole film!",Bonnie and Clyde
304,plounzzzz,great film,8,9 May 2017,"Arthur Penn directs this film very well with an awesome variety of shots. The first time Clyde shoots someone through the car window was incredible and well portrayed. The best part of the film for me was how the relationship of Bonnie and Clyde was depicted. The character development between the two is unparalleled. Clyde does not want to have sex. Bonnie wants to do something other than be on the run for their entire life. Clyde wants to look out for his family but at the same time they have some conflicting moments. At the end of the day, these two really love each other more than anything. They always come back to one another despite their conflicts. The movie is a true love story to say the least.",Bonnie and Clyde
305,gnc98,Believable Relationship,7,11 May 2017,"Bonnie and Clyde is an interesting film because of where it falls in cinematic history. The Hays Code had dissolved and the ""New Hollywood"" era began, where film makers would continue to push boundaries from what was typically allowed under the code. Bonnie and Clyde came out a couple years after the code had been lifted, so it was in a nice position where plenty of the trail had already been blazed by previous films. Audiences were used to seeing more risky content, and just like its predecessors, Bonnie and Clyde continues to push the envelope. The scene that really shows this best is the ending, where the devious duo meet their end in a hail of gunfire. The scene is explicit and shows blood; something that had been done before, but what sets it apart from the films that came before it is the length of the scene and the use of slow motion to draw out their final moments. In a way, their deaths are sort of romanticized and the violence is glorified on the screen, as bullet after bullet tears through the titular couple. With all this said, Bonnie and Clyde does far more to impress rather than one ultra-violent scene. The relationship between the two is believable, and the two leads do a fantastic job playing off one another. Throughout the film both leads are sexualized (in fact the first scene shows Bonnie completely naked, although the more sensitive areas are still covered or out of frame) and it comes to a tipping point when the two are in bed, kissing passionately; but then Bonnie realizes that Clyde is impotent. Instead of being disappointed, the two just lay with each other. It shows a mature, believable relationship that extends much further than sexual desires, and it's great for doing so. On the surface, the movie's about two criminals robbing banks and killing, but you get these deep moments sprinkled throughout and it shows that it's about the love story between the two characters, and the development of their bond that really makes them who they are. It's something beautiful to behold.",Bonnie and Clyde

Even though this film is pretty old it's still very much enjoyable and I'm not saying what they did was okay or interesting or enjoyable.

311,jokercard88,Nonestop fun until...,8,19 February 2003,"The last 15-20 minutes that Bonnie and Clyde was probably best known for.  The story of Bonnie and Clyde is a true story fashioned up by Hollywood about a girl in a small town who is bored out of her mind until a bank robbers comes trying to steal her mom's car.  She rushes over to stop him and ends up walking to work with him. And, you guessed it, she asks him what his job is.  Then you get the whole no way thing.  To sum it up, that's how they met up. Now, I loved Faye Dunaway in Chinatown, and was eager to see her in another good movie.  Well, Bonnie and Clyde is it.  It turns out that Bonnie and Clyde is miles ahead of Chinatown as far as Faye Dunaway's looks AND performance goes.  Faye and Warren Beatty are great as a duo, and the plot makes their screenplay even more entertaining.  Just think, for a date, they'd rob a bank.        Of coarse, they didn't alone form a bank robbing gang.  They met up with a tire changer or whatever named CW. Moss, and Clyde's friend, Buck Barrow (and Buck Barrow's wife), and that was the gang. Bonnie and Clyde is an ideal Summer movie (until the end) where the fun doesn't let up.  Faye Dunaway's quite the hottie (not as of 2003, but in this movie), CW plays a funny guy.  It feels like they're the unstoppable bankrobbers who're the good guys, while the cops and the sheriff are the bad guys who always screw up.  But this can be discouraging: in the true event, they died, and this movie is based on a true story, after all. Those rooting for Bonnie and Clyde will drop their jaws near the end when the movie makes a 180o turnaround.  The sheriff they embarrassed earlier, ambushed CW and Clyde's friends' wife, and, welllet's just say the movie takes a twisted turn right there. Bonnie and Clyde is a fun movie I recommend to any1, whether cassual movie watcher, or movie 'hobbyist'. 100%",Bonnie and Clyde

I liked the plot of the movie, i thought the action scenes were very good. How they came together in the beginning i thought was a little weird because they know each other for about 20 minutes and before the viewer knows it, Bonnie and Clyde are off robbing every bank they can. I also thought it was weird how Bonnie and Clyde went around looking for more attention by telling people who they were and what they were doing.

Both Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway do a flawless in the portrayal of their characters, and really established themselves after as great actors in their time.

My expectations were blown out of the water. Bonnie and Clyde was one of the most romantic, crazy, thrilling movies I have ever seen. The whole story behind it blows my mind still and I find it all to be so interesting. I felt the cinematography was put together pretty well. I felt at times the camera shots were a little too shaky and the editing was a little to quick for me. For example, in the end scene where Bonnie and Clyde both are killed, the camera is a little shaky and at times have an awkward angle. Also, the editing done was way to fast jumping back and forth and using quick cuts. Although, i understand the message that the cinematographer was trying to portray by doing that.

Once they start robbing stores and banks the movie gets a lot better. I was wondering where they were going to rob from next. They have some people tag along with them while they are on there adventure of robbing. Personally I didn't care about the other people, when those people got left behind or died I just didn't really care. I only cared about Bonnie and Clyde.

It was inevitable that Bonnie was going to fall for the ""bad boy"" ( Clyde).I thought the shooting and violence was rushed.I also didn't like Hackman and Parsons because I thought their characters roles were over the top. For example, Parsons screaming was irritating.Rede Allens editing was amazing in my opinion. The slow motion parts were my favorite because it emphasized what was actually going on.

322,daretostruggledaretowin,Counter-cultural cooptation,8,26 April 2016,"Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde was one of the first films to break the production code era's taboo on gore and graphic violence. Of course, Bonnie and Clyde is more than just bloody bullet holes. It is actually a somewhat subversive film that follows a dust bowl Robin Hood and Maid Marian while they recruit disciples and stuff their pockets all while taking care not to exploit the impoverished.The film takes place during the depression and FDR campaign posters are prominently displayed throughout the film. Beatty's Clyde Barrow is morally opposed to taking money from the poor, but morally inclined to take money from the banks. From the scene where he allows the sharecroppers' whose home was foreclosed by the bank to shoot up the place, Beatty's Clyde proves himself a 20th century Robin Hood. Of course, historical proof probably is inclined otherwise.Penn's Bonnie and Clyde are not meant to be historically accurate portrayals, though. The film was released in 1967 at the heart of the so-called ""Summer of Love,"" when the American counter-culture was possibly at its most strong. Additionally, Hollywood was suffering a lull. The supposedly depression-proof industry was suffering because they had failed to produce many memorable films during the production era (other than a handful of film Noir classics).The ending scene of Bonnie and Clyde is considered a classic and I will spoil it for you: they get filled with bright red bullet holes. Even after reading these spoilers, the film is worth watching. It was the harbinger of a renaissance in cinema. Soon after Roger Corman, Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper as well as Robert Downey's crew had shot some brilliant films inspired by the indulgences explored by Beatty's Bonnie and Clyde.

Fortunately Arthur Penn took over. I say fortunately, not because I think any less of Truffaut or Godard but I'm sure nobody could have made this glorious American classic but Arthur Penn. Somehow there is an air of Frenchness permeating every frame even if Bonnie and Clyde is profoundly American. For a foreigner, like me, America has always been a Country to admire even if puzzling. Guns and Bibles. Violence with a poetic aura that it's as startling as it is disturbing. Warren Beatty is superb as Clyde - the real life character was homosexual but for the film he is impotent - more acceptable? Amazing to think of it now. Faye Dunaway became an icon, deservedly so.

Therefore, it's not surprising that this movie is cited by many as the first movie of New Hollywood and as very influential. Various aspects of the movie, including the intense gun scenes (with blood) and the kissing scenes (hinting not very subtly at sex) must have been incredibly exciting for movie-goers at the time, as these scenes went against the dying Hays Code during the past (almost) 40 years. It is most likely for these reasons that the film is so well known. Although the new feel of the film and the great editing and cinematography (like in many of the shooting scenes) was fun to watch, I personally felt that the plot was a bit boring to follow and repetitive. Of course, the questions that this film brings up are still important (and would not have been repetitive or cliche for movie-goers at the time). We are encouraged to ask ourselves why we sympathize with the ""bad guys."" Is it because a small part of us wishes that we could be like them, and watching the movie allows us an outlet for these wishes? We are also encouraged to recognize how addicting bad behavior can become and how blinding adrenaline can be. It may just be my biases as a person of the younger generation today that caused me to find the plot boring, but in trying to look at the movie from an older generation's eyes when it first came out, I can definitely appreciate the novelty and excitement this film must have caused.",Bonnie and Clyde

Aside from the Oscar winning performances the film has odd staging and out of place editing/cuts. For example, the first scene has a jump cut right as Bonnie gets up to look out of the window. The two cuts do not flow together, they aren't seamless like most other film edits. Also, there are moments where the actions of the characters are just awkward i.e. when Bonnie and Clyde are about to make love for the first time and Clyde angrily denies her. The choreography of that scene was very off aside from the fact that the moment was awkward by nature. 
The music was terrible but fitting. I felt that the banjo was too much, in the worst way and brought the film down. But, again, it was fitting. I get it.

331,dlaferriere,Summary,7,19 January 2006,"I think the movie itself was a great film. It was well done and the story was a good one. The only problem I had with the film was the way Bonnie and Clyde were made out to be. In real life they were hard evil criminals, but in the movie they were romanticized and made out to not be that bad. Other then embellishing the characters and a few other minor details I loved the movie.For the time the gun fight effects were pretty good. They had good detail in and around the fight scenes, including the blood effects. It was a pretty bloody movie which qualifies as a good movie in my book because where there is blood there is action so it keeps you on the edge of your seat. The first homicide in the movie surprised me. I didn't think it would be like that. I thought it would be from far away and not be very detailed and gory. In fact it was right up close in the face with blood and all. It was totally unexpected. The other scene that was pretty gory was the end scene when Bonnie and Clyde were ambushed. That scene was very gory for the time. I did not expect that at all because not only did they shoot them but they kept shooting them and brutalized their bodies.The other part of the movie that I liked was the driving scenes. There were a lot of good fast chase scenes through fields and other remote parts. I find chase scenes to be exhilarating especially when there is a gun fight going on at the same time. The whole movie was basically either in a high speed chase or a shootout which made it pretty suspenseful. When one of these wasn't going on it was building up to the next one and you could feel it coming so I was on the edge of my seat just waiting for something to happen.The acting itself was pretty good. The main actors were good and knew what they were doing. On the other hand the secondary actors were not very good. They seemed scared and seemed like they didn't know what to do. Bonnie's mother for example gave me the impression that she was reading off of a script during the movie. She seemed like she really had no idea what was going on. So other then the secondary characters it was a well done movie acting wise. Overall I liked this movie a lot because or the chases, gunfights, and the acting.",Bonnie and Clyde
332,kwalsh2-1,Reflection of the 60's,6,19 January 2006,"The December 26th issue of Time's magazine, the year Bonnie and Clyde was released, ran a letter from an eighteen-year-old college freshman who maintained that the movie was not a film for adults because she was able to relate to Bonnie and Clyde, and she wanted to be like them before their death at the end of the film. This is proof that this film was made for an audience in the 1960's. As a college student, I do not feel that I related to Bonnie or Clyde in this violent film. Instead, I was able to understand some of the emotions they must have been going through, because of society's knowledge and popularity in the psyche of those who go against the ""norm"". However, Bonnie and Clyde were criminals to the highest extent. They were able to kill multiple police officers without an incredibly overpowering sense of guilt. Even if I were to find that I killed someone by accident with my car, I would find it very hard to live with myself. In this sense, Bonnie and Clyde seem grossly insensitive to death.The movie industry found that violence was what the audience wanted. It has escalated to a point of no return. Henry Miller, in Penthouse, states, ""I feel compelled to look upon the viewers as even more sick than the killers they are watching."" I would agree with him to an extent. The people that are attracted to the bloody red scenes of violence and death may only be curious of a world they are missing out on. Bonnie and Clyde exemplified this characteristic in Bonnie, as she is curious about Clyde's world of robbing and guns. She is able to explore that world, but it comes to a consequence. As viewers in an audience, we are able to explore a world we could not imagine while safely sitting in our seats at a theater or home. Some critics suggest that movies are responsible for all of the violence that goes on in today. That could be true, but it also provides an alternative people who are curious about the world of crime.The parallelism between Bonnie and Clyde and the 60's is overpowering. Bonnie shows us the feminist thinking of the times. She poses with guns, and is able to shoot one like a man. She was essentially a cowboy with a pretty face. The fact that the viewers are set up to like Bonnie and Clyde provides an outlook into the way of life at that time. It was a time for protests and rebellion. Bonnie and Clyde appeals to the desire for rebellion that the youths were feeling. When the policemen shoot them until they are dead, we are provided the opportunity to see the position of Bonnie and Clyde. The style portrays the policemen, and in a larger picture, the authority in a humiliating context. They seem incapable of capturing a man and woman in a game of violence. The negative light shining upon the authority shows how little respect they received. The idea of placing the bad guys as good guys and vice versa made the world of movies different forever, which makes Bonnie and Clyde an incredible film with high accomplishments, as well as a reflection of the 1960's.",Bonnie and Clyde
333,gleebs75,An Important Part of American Culture,8,19 January 2006,"In order to fully appreciate Bonnie and Clyde for its cinematic brilliance, it is important to disregard any information about the real Bonnie and Clyde that is known. This film is not a historical recollection of the ""adventures"" of Bonnie and Clyde. It is, in fact, a Hollywood re-telling that romanticizes the crimes of this infamous couple. The real Bonnie and Clyde were not fashionable victims of a cops and robbers gamethey were criminals and murderers. Therefore, when taken at face-value, this film can be enraging, but if the gross exaggeration of the couple's way of life is ignored, one is left with a very artistic, meaningful film that displays a time period of American culture that is vital to history. Bonnie and Clyde is more the story of American rebellion and anti-government feelings during the late 1960s than a story about two criminals trying to escape the endless reach of ""the law."" This is one of the first films to be made after the Hays Code was ended, meaning that it was allowed to be overtly violent, sexy and graphic. It was also one of the first films that was able to openly display officials (policemen, the government, etc) as ""the bad guys"" instead of ""the good guys."" Some of the most memorable scenes in Bonnie and Clyde are ones in which the government or ""the law"" is mocked openly. For instance, when Clyde is teaching Bonnie how to shoot a gun at an abandoned house and runs into the family who used to own the house before the bank took it, Clyde shoots the sign that says it had been taken. He then gives the gun to the old man who owned the house, who also shoots it and then passes it along to an old black man who had helped him tend to the land for his turn. It was a very powerful scene that represented the feelings that many Americans had about their government not only in the 1930s during the Depression, but in the 1960s during the time of the Vietnam War. The general feelings of distrust and resentment that Americans had towards their government during this time were also displayed by the mockery that was made of the Texas Rangers and other policemen in Bonnie and Clyde. The humorous scene where Bonnie and Clyde pose for a picture with the handcuffed Texas Ranger does a particularly good job of this, as does the scene where a policeman from one of the banks that they robbed was interviewed and treated like a hero, even though he let them get away. All in all, I believe this film to be a very important part of American film history. Although the history of the real Bonnie and Clyde was not accurately depicted, Bonnie and Clyde, with all of its violence and sexuality, most accurately depicts American culture and attitude during the 1960s.",Bonnie and Clyde

The action scenes added to the overall excitement of the movie and the violence portrayed within the film is certainly why it feels ""emotionally dark"" in the end. The use of sound in the movie was also incredible the sound effects were right on and the music used fit perfectly.

It showed realistic things that were not really being shown at the time due to the censorship code. But, with the dismantle of the code the filmmakers had a lot of room to try out new things never before done. A scene that perhaps best reflects this is in the end when Bonnie and Clyde are gunned down by police. They're shot several upon several times and practically lit up with bullets. This scene is very gory, but it shows their bodies being continuely torn apart with bullets. This is something that audiences back in 1967 weren't used to seeing due to the code. This film became an example of what films could now show. Great movie!",Bonnie and Clyde

339,jcoolum,Revolutionary,9,19 January 2006,"""Bonnie and Clyde"" is one of those movies a young movie enthusiast, such as myself, hears about growing up. Growing up when I did, in the late 80s and early 90s, ""Bonnie and Clyde"" was a movie everyone knew about and just about everyone loved. I had never seen all of the film and it has always eluded me somehow. I finally was able to watch the movie in its entirety a few days ago and I was impressed. The movie, from an artistic standpoint, seems to be flawless. The film has great acting, the best by Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, a great story and screenplay, as well as memorable characters. The cinematography is beautiful. Cinematographer Burnett Guffey and director Arthur Penn were able to find some truly astounding locations in Texas to film.The characters are very interesting and engaging. Clyde is depicted as a sly, petty thief who gets in over his head and is actually very likable. The same goes for Bonnie. She is depicted as a bored Texas girl who wants to have fun. Bonnie also gets into a situation out of her hands and she is portrayed as a nice young girl. Buck, Clyde's brother, (played by Gene Hackman) is also a very likable character who bites off more than he can chew and he drags his wife Blanch (played by Estelle Parsons) into the entire mess. The final member of their gang is a young auto mechanic named C.W. (played by Michael J. Pollard) who decides to join Bonnie and Clyde in their adventures. I found myself having a great amount of fun watching the movie and cheering for Bonnie and Clyde. After viewing the film, I found myself asking why I cheered for Bonnie and Clyde. They, essentially, were the villains of the story. The historical Bonnie and Clyde, as well as the rest of their gang, killed people, stole money, stole cars, and took hostages. Clyde even made it to ""public enemy no. 1."" They were not nice people, although they have been mythologized as being misunderstood. In the film, Bonnie and Clyde hold up a bank and Clyde asks a farmer if the money on the counter was his or the banks. The man says it is his and Clyde lets him keep it. Bonnie and Clyde are portrayed as benevolent even though they are murderous robbers. Another thing that was noticeable in the film was that no one wanted to turn Bonnie and Clyde in to the police save C.W.'s father. Most of the civilians in the film either idolized Bonnie and Clyde or were in a state of awe when they saw them. Although ""Bonnie and Clyde"" is not historically accurate, it is a masterpiece of the 1960s. Its revolutionary storytelling, violence, and rebellious vigor helped shape what cinema is today.",Bonnie and Clyde

I got really bored watching it and it did not reach my expectations at all. It was very repetitive, they would rob a bank, then police would find them and there would be a big shoot scene, then they would get away, and then the same thing would happen again. I didn't understand the whole meet up with her family either like how did that even get arranged? A couple of things didn't make sense to me and overall I was just not pleased.

341,mcfloodhorse,breaking the wave,10,27 February 2009,"Rocking the cinema several years after the French New Wave and its deconstructivist approach to established film syntax, ""Bonnie and Clyde"" isn't so much an experiment in iconoclasm as it is a post-modern (re-)construction of the gangster film as a true American folktale fantasy. The existential vacuousness pervading the Nouvelle Vague finds renewed expression in the eerily empty landscapes and towns, in Clyde's charismatic ambivalence toward crime, and in Bonnie's charmingly fatalist poetry.Yet Arthur Penn wisely replaces French frivolousness with the profound tension and despair of Depression-era dilapidation. Although it's a damn funny film, all the laughs are constrained by a sense of impending doom. Seeing Clyde hand his gun over to a pair of oldtimers so they can shoot at their now repossessed home they themselves built, acts as a snapshot of the titular characters' exploits: briefly gratifying, enduringly defiant, but essentially futile.",Bonnie and Clyde

I said that from the moment I saw it one spring night and kept thinking about it until the next week and the next and the next... Thinking about that last look - the greatest look ever captured on celluloid -  that Bonnie and Clyde exchange before they sink forever into their silence. It is the look that holds in it the whole beauty of the movie itself. The pain, the hope, the poetry of it all. Bonnie and Clyde are not just two random people that meet in a random moment in their life. They are THE people and the moment is THE moment that marks their life forever. They were destined to be together until the end and no matter how much they tried nobody ever made them part. And that's what gives us the greatest love story of all time. The ONLY real and destined love story of all time. I didn't say I loved this movie from the moment I saw it. I was too stunned to speak then. But I say this now. And I'll keep saying it until the end. When all of our flesh is dust and all of our minds a great big step into the knowledge that nothing is forever. R.I.P.",Bonnie and Clyde
343,cmcafeeky,Beatty and Dunaway sizzle,9,17 May 2011,"Bonnie and Clyde (1967)The highly stylized violence glamorized in Bonnie and Clyde is closely interwoven with sex to grandly glorify both. Director Arthur Penn was greatly influenced by the French New Wave filmmakers and his romanticized violence along with the trajectory and impending downfall of the protagonist due to criminal involvement is now a Hollywood template for criminal dramas. Gangster movies from the Thirties glorified criminality and living the good life, Penn helped usher in the sexual element to create an unbeatable combination.In the early Thirties, several real life criminals became American celebrates. The American Publics infatuation with gangster films was bolstered by constant newsreel and newspaper articles detailing the latest exploits of real life criminals like Al Capone and John Dillinger. Films such as Little Caesar (1931), The Public Enemy (1931), and Scarface (1932) were wildly successful, as well as classic examples of the philosophical debate of life imitating art-art imitating life. Scarface was especially titillating in that it incorporated details of Capone's life that were well known to the public. These films were released in what was known as cinemas Pre-Code era that saw little restrictions standing in the way of portraying sex and violence in motion picture. As the depression era crime wave escalated, the government intervened with the Hays Code and later the Breen Office as watch dogs of acceptability. Hays went so far as to mandate that Dillinger not be portrayed in any motion picture, while Capone was reportedly offered seven figures to appear in a film. As the restrictions on violence eventually stripped away much of the allure, the gangster movie lost much of its luster, until Penn's Bonnie and Clyde.Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow were depression era bank robbers brought to the attention of America during the ""Public Enemy"" era between 1931 and 1934. The Bonnie Parker image of cigar smoking gun moll was generated by a series of gun wielding poses the gang left behind in Joplin Mo after narrowly escaping authorities. The photographs were quickly spread across the wire service and instantly brought them to the public's attention. It is the illicit suggestion that these two were engaged in a relationship containing more than bank robberies and shootouts that galvanized the two into pop culture folklore. There were several two bit punks during the era, but with Bonnie along for the fun the two were destined to be immortalized. The Dunaway Beatty version mirrors the original outlaws, with both couples catapulted into being criminal superstars with the same powerful mix of violence and sex. Warren Beatty and Fay Dunaway capitalize on the sexuality of Bonnie and Clyde, while pushing the limits to exploit their own allure and charisma. The sex appeal of Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty is immediate. It sizzles. The pair would be hard pressed to be surpassed as one of the screens hottest pairings.Warren Beatty had long been considered one of Hollywood's most eligible bachelors, and has been quite the lady's man throughout his movie career having been linked with a string of bombshells. Beatty is famously considered as one of Hollywood's all time womanizers. His real life reputation couldn't be further from the struggles Clyde barrow faced in the bedroom, but it is ironic that maybe Clyde carries such a big powerful gun because of implied impotence. Beatty's ego is intact and self-confidence is secure in order for him taking on a character with sexual dysfunction. Dunaway's fellatio seems to eventually solve his problems, although it's a shame that Clyde couldn't have lasted a little longer, before coming to a bad end.Dunaway has an allure that mesmerizes, especially during the early scenes as her close ups are a Botticelli ode to screen goddesses. Fay Dunaway is shimmering white hot here. Her first contact with Clyde is unclothed, hidden behind a semi opaque window peering down at Clyde. It might be impossible for any red blooded American boy to look away from Dunaway's Bonnie Parker, even when there is a car that begs to be stolen. Dunaway's portrayal is a delicious Hollywood bombshell in it penultimate personage, as she provides one of the sexiest roles in film history.The supporting actors seem to have intentionally been cast by less attractive actors than their real life counterparts in order to further push the sexuality of Beatty and Dunaway, although it would have hardly mattered as any actors would pale in comparison. The supporting cast is exemplary. Estelle Parsons shines in a role that rightfully garnered the Academy Award for best supporting actress for the high pitched scream queen who just cannot handle the criminal lifestyle or constant gun play. She is great here, but does get annoying as her portrayal makes Bonnie seem hyper cool in comparison. Michael Pollard embodies several real life associates of the gang, and provides a star struck 'aw- shucks' wholesomeness who seems somewhat honored to be able to participate with the infamous duo. It's a joy to see his awkward reactions, seemingly in constant blush as it's his privilege to be so close to proceedings. It's also interesting that the writers and preproduction plans were to involve Pollards character sharing in Bonnie and Clyde's bed. Gene Hackman shines as Buck Barrow, Clyde's brother, providing a good natured earnestness straight from the rural heartland of America. The Texas Ranger Frank Hamer (Denver Pyle) is a flat neutral character, and it seems odd that Arthur Penn didn't do more with the character considering Hamer killed 53 people while working for the state of Texas.Bottom Line: I would give this a 94. It is one of the great achievements in film. The film tries to adhere to a realistic portrayal of the real exploits of the gang, but it is a somewhat romanticized version. Relative to other Hollywood treatments of historical events, it is relatively close depiction, but does serve to further mythologize the couple. (May 2011)",Bonnie and Clyde

The movie was incredibly edgy for its time with the glorified violence, fast-driving and the memorable scene of Buck Barrow getting shot in the head.This movie is a blast from start to finish, even if it may be slightly embellished from the truth. It is so original and fun that we stand on our seats throughout.The cast is perfect. Beatty with his charming performance (not to mention his impotence), the pretty-eyed Dunaway with her charismatic voice ""We...rob...banks"" and the introduction (well, his first famous film at least) to actor Gene Hackman. He nails it with the brandy joke.Albeit this film may have pushed-the-envelope with the violence for its time (and some say the ending was the most violent scene in a film for it's time, being before the baptism in The Godfather) the film is quite tame by today's standards.

348,tpion,Bonnie & Clyde,10,19 January 2006,"The movie Bonnie & Clyde directed by Arthur Penn in 1967 could be described as a revolution in the way of the film and movie business. Movies at that time had strict production codes which were established to make the movie clean and descent for people to watch. For instance they could have a no swearing code or no sexual content. They even went so far as to have codes on the film saying that the villain could never prevail; the good guys had to win.In this movie we saw a complete break off from the so called production codes. There were many sexual scenes as well as profanity being used throughout the whole movie. Even more interesting or not is the fact that when watching this movie you were really rooting for the bad guys (Bonnie & Clyde) to get away from the law to rob another bank. These two people were not nice people they robbed banks out of their money, stole cars, and even resorted to murdering not only policeman but the public too. But the way the movie was scene through the eyes of the audience we wanted to the villains to win or get away. This movie could be compared to Smokey an the Bandit where as these two guys are being chased for pulling clever schemes on the lawmen their but always seems to get away and that's what the audience really wants.It was a very exciting and entertaining movie to say the least even though compared to modern day movies where the technology as well as the film is so much more crisp and refined. Nonetheless it was a great movie to watch having everything from suspense, drama, girls, money you could almost say it was a shoot em' up kind of movie. Being of only 21 years of age I wasn't able to experience any of these movies made through the 60's-70's but I was able to see actors like Gene Hackman play roles when he was younger and much more youthful than what I am used too.I think that this movie really did help bring the movies into a whole new realm of possibilities. Without this movie who knows what the standards of movie could have been like for the past 40 years. I hope that sometime in my day I can watch and be part of a movie that makes American history.",Bonnie and Clyde
349,rhall-14,"We rob banks, huh?",7,27 January 2006,"A film produced in 1967, Bonnie and Clyde has been celebrated as being one of the turning points for the modern age of film. It seemed to pave the way for other films, changing conventional wisdom and adding new and more extreme elements to the movie industry.As I watched the film I noticed a variety of examples that exemplified these groundbreaking changes in the industry. The most obvious of these examples is the high amount of violence in the film, and the very explicit way in which it was shown. At the time the movie was made, in the late 1960's, movie audiences were not accustomed to high levels of violence in full length films. In the various scenes when Buck, Clyde, Bonnie, and even Blanche were wounded by bullets, the director had no problems showing the wounds, and showing the violent actions that produced them. And of course, the final scene of the movie, which concluded with the realistic portrayal of Bonnie and Clyde's assassination and the final shot of the bullet ridden car and bodies of the bandits, proved to be a shocking ending to the film. Basically, the violent aspect of this movie not only gave it a sense of realism, but set it apart from earlier films and paved the way for realistic, effective violence in future movies.Another part of Bonnie and Clyde that changed the face of film was the change in the conventions of typical film. A typical movie during this time portrayed the ""good guys"" as the main characters, and the ""bad guys"" as characters you felt no sympathy or good will toward. However, Bonnie and Clyde and the rest of the Barrow gang were all outlaws and bandits, yet they were the people you admired throughout the movie. This changed the face of the common movie, making it acceptable for ""bad guys"" to be important, likable characters. It took historically dangerous characters, and romanticized them, turning them into folk heroes and movie legends.Also, the realism of making Clyde have a sexual problem was a new and unusual aspect in the movie industry. To have a main character with such an odd flaw was a very new thing. Usually, lead male characters were ""lover boys"", yet Clyde struggled throughout the movie to satisfy Bonnie. Warren Beatty's portrayal of this outlaw who believed himself to be ""the best"" while having such an obvious problem, simply made the film more realistic and moving.In general, this film paved the way for future films with its originality and its destruction of past film barriers. Bonnie and Clyde could effectively be described as the beginning of the modern age of film in America.",Bonnie and Clyde

This movie is post code and it shows from the violence and the romance they allowed on screen. This movie has something for everyone, gun fights for the boys, love for the girls.

As one of the first films in the New Hollywood era, it was ground breaking, and inspired other great movies, such as Buch Cassidy and the Sundance kid. However, I don't think the movie provides as much entertainment as it does nostalgia. There is no denying the movie is very well done, from the acting, to the cinematography, to the editing, to the sound, and of course, those special effects. But I just couldn't find the story compelling. It probably would've resonated a lot more had I watched it back in the 60s when the great depression was more recent, but watching it now, it simply didn't resonate. And I didn't think it was fun enough to just be a crime/action/thriller either. They did to many stupid things on the crime front for me to take that part of the movie seriously, and I kind of hated Bonnie and Clyde's personalities from the beginning so I never really cared about their personal interactions. Overall, it was still a very well-made movie that is worth watching for the historical factor alone (both of the actual making of the movie and also the affect of the great depression). Although, who knows, you might enjoy the story. (Two people can have different opinions, right? I think that's allowed in 2019.)

357,bryan-306,great movie,9,19 January 2006,"Bonnie and Clyde was most definitely a microcosm of the youth rebellion happening during the mid and late sixties. It's breaking of the motion picture production code was a poignant stab by the director at the censorship of authority. Furthermore, the characters Bonnie and Clyde were considered to be folk heroes and champions for the disenfranchised and unheard youth of the United States. Bonnie was seen to be a hero for female freedom. For all of these reasons, Bonnie and Clyde was popular beyond precedent worldwide. Many considered Bonnie and Clyde as the vehicle which rewrote the national narrative. The feeling around the country was so dis-unified at the time, which is why so many of the reviews were split down the middle. There were the older and more conservative reviewers like Crowther, who panned the movie and named it a promoter of violence at a very fragile time (""These films of excessive violence only deaden (our) sensitivities and make slaughter seem a meaningless cliché). Then there were the younger and more radical reviewers who accepted the movie for the emotion it was meant to incite. The fact of the matter is that many people were offended by the movie, but failed to realize that underneath it all, a motion picture is intended to reach people. That fact is often not realized because of the watered down mush that Hollywood tends to churn out. If a movie enacts a reaction that monumental, there should be something done about it. Is that really the case? By the time this movie came out, no one remembered the thirties and twenties. The movie was obviously not meant to display a historical recount of those times. Instead, it was a statement of what many youths considered the status quo during the turbulent sixties. Cinema had become the favorite art form of the young. Youths connected with the movie because of its anti establishment tune. It was the ""us or them"" mentality. Many scenes throughout the movie construe the couple as heroes. The farmer who proclaims, ""I'm bringing flowers to their funeral"", after Bonnie and Clyde tell him to keep his money and get lost. Another instance is when they roll into a small community destroyed by the dust bowl, who are mesmerized by these mythic figures. They even give them what little water and food they have. Although many of the sixties generation's actions were not as violent and pronounced, they still carried the same ideal. They were burning bras, demonstrating against the state, evading the draft and experimenting with drugs. Bonnie was unlike any other female lead that had even been seen on screen. She robbed banks and wrote poetry about it. She committed crimes with the power and authority of man and furthermore she enjoyed it. She broke the complacent nurturing role of many women throughout film and rewrote a female hero.

We also see a very young gene wilder in his first role. And the film has some of the best set pieces in films. The ending shootout puts scarface's to shame. The film has great dialogue and The film is paced wounderfully the film is fastpaced with shootouts and chases. Like the shootout at the hotel amazing tommy guns and all.

362,giggitygiggitygoo451,An Extremely Important And Ground-breaking American Film.,7,14 July 2012,"Whether you love or hate it, Bonnie and Clyde was, and remains to this day, a ground-breaking film in the history of American cinema, and should be praised hugely for that alone. Aside from the re-defining techniques of showing violence on-screen and the depiction of main characters who are far from typical heroes, it contains career-boosting roles for many actors, and comes from a very talented director of the time, Arthur Penn.The story follows the titular real-life bandit couple of Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker. The story traces them from first meeting, and follows their crime-spree throughout a Depression-era America with their gang, robbing banks, evading police and creating a notorious reputation for themselves. The film is slightly romanticised, depicting the couple as young, foolish kids who don't really seem to realise what they're getting into, but the violent and unpredictable undertone and the impressive period detail ensures an edge that lifts it above typical gangster movies, and always assures us that what's happening isn't remotely romantic, while granting the characters and events gritty depth.Penn is on fine form from the beginning, and handles a range of different scenes with ease and a huge amount of skill, from thrilling banks-robberies and shootouts, to the more intimate character scenes, in particular those between Bonnie and Clyde, which depict one of the most interesting and unusual screen couples to date. The cinematography and editing are used to huge effect, and resulted in some of the most ground-breaking scenes of the 60's, while the folk-style soundtrack gives an air of humour.The film tends to play a bit fast-and-loose with the facts- like condensing several real-life members of the gang into the single character C.W. Moss, and neglecting the fact that for nearly a year, Bonnie was almost unable to walk due to a car crash, but writers David Newman and Robert Benton can be forgiven for these inaccuracies considering they succeeded in crafting a story that is both thrilling and exciting as well as tragic and thought-provoking.But the story would be nothing without first-rate cast it boasts. Warren Beatty as Clyde excels in the multi-layered, dramatic role that he had sought after for so long, and more than succeeded in his attempt to be taken seriously as an actor. Beatty's depiction of a confident, intelligent, but naive young man looking to make his name and fortune is spot-on, and while romanticised to a certain degree, is never glorified. His Clyde is more than matched by Faye Dunaway's Bonnie, who gives a hugely convincing portrayal of an everyday girl getting caught up in something she should never have become part of. The two have an excellent and very unusual chemistry, even by today's standards, and work together brilliantly as a man not used to such intimacy and a woman desperate to live the romantic life of an outlaw with him.The supporting players may not be quite as strong as the leads, but hold their own quite well, particularly Gene Hackman as Buck. In my opinion one of the greatest actors of all time, Hackman gives a brilliant performance that's both spirited and grounded as Clyde's brother, expressing the same wide-eyed desire for the life of an outlaw as the others and maintains a hugely convincing brotherly relationship with Beatty throughout. Michael Pollard also performs well as gang member C.W, whose quiet demeanour assures his character stands out, despite being relatively small. Estelle Parsons suffers with Blanche, a supremely annoying character that personally I found too irritating. But in fairness, that's precisely the intention behind the character, and Parsons certainly manages to convey it. Throw in one of Gene Wilder's first screen performances and you have an extremely talented and interesting cast.But aside from the great cast and direction, the truly ground-breaking, incredibly influential aspect of the film is much simpler and much more important- the depiction of on-screen violence and the impact it makes. For the first time, when people were shot or killed, it looked like it hurt. Bad. Penn and his crew pushed boundaries that before, hadn't even been considered. Suddenly, violence was being portrayed in a gritty, shocking and unsettling way. For the first time, screen violence was truly violent. This is what made the story of a group of young and naive people deciding to become criminals so powerful- the fact that we really saw what that really meant. We see what it's like to be shot, and this helps to drive home their story with such impact and power. This was the first step taken that shaped the entire future of motion-picture, and inspired other films to follow it's example, such as The Wild Bunch, and later films like MASH and Jaws that continued to push the limits of what could be done on screen.Now, I am definitely NOT a fan of gore or extreme violence. Give me E.T and Toy Story before all the Saws and Texas Chainsaw Massacres in the world. But that doesn't mean violence in films is wrong. Violence can be a means of driving home a point, or setting a film's atmosphere, or at times it can even just be pretty damn satisfying. But whether you're a pacifist or a gore-hound, it can't be denied that violence in films is prominent, and many times it's done well, while other times it's not. This film revolutionised it. And more than that, it gave film-makers the influence to do other new things, and was the perfect film to kick-start the revolutionary era of the late 60's and 70's, and inspired them to use their own ideas rather than what would make money.This is a very special film. Personally, not one of my favourites, but it deserves a good 8 out of 10 purely for its historical relevance and powerhouse cast. It may not be perfect, but if you haven't seen it, see it, and know that you're watching history being made.",Bonnie and Clyde
363,patrickf,Gangsters as Romantic Rebels,8,14 November 2000,"A stylish, romantic epic based on the lives of the notorious Barrow Gang, this is Arthur Penn at his best. The period detail is immaculate, from the bluegrass soundtrack to the U.S. Farm Administration photographs in the opening credits. Yet this is no staid period piece. It's romanticisation of the main characters - violent psycopaths - prefigures other controversial films such as ""The Wild Bunch"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""Natural Born Killers"", ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"". Brilliant and fast-paced, with great acting from Beatty, Dunaway, Hackman etc. Yet it curiously sanitises the real Bonnie & Clyde's bisexuality (C.W. Moss was the sexual partner of Bonnie and Clyde). I guess the late 60's was ready for graphic violence but not gender ambivalence.",Bonnie and Clyde

365,rferentz,One of my favorite films of all time.,10,18 March 2008,"This is a film that rest atop my list of personal favorite of all time. The cast is first-rate. Warren Beatty gives a wonderfully underrated performance (notice how he keeps a limp through the entire film because he chopped to two off his foot). Faye Dunaway, who has never been more beautiful, shot to stardom and deservedly so. I can't not imagine anyone else in this role. Estelle Parsons deservedly won the Academy Award for her humorous and touching performance. Gene Hackman, Micheal J. Pollard complete the perfect cast. The direction by Arthur Penn is top notch, and the screenplay is (in my opinion) one of the best ever written for the silver screen. The cinematography is breathtaking, and the musical score superb. I would highly recommend this film to anyone. Yes. Anyone.",Bonnie and Clyde

I think its interesting and challenging to make a film such as this one, with beautiful stars as the ones in this film and have as little sexual content in it. I mean, yes it showed bonnie naked, and yes they eventually had sex, but it was made very clear that this movie meant to suggest another theme. Its actually relieving to watch something that is less about a sexual relationships and more about the personal mental relationships between these outgoing bank robbers. With this different theme, the director was able to concentrate on making the main characters seem less dense, and more intense.",Bonnie and Clyde

Faye Dunnaway is gorgeous, and Warren Beatty gives a great performance. There is a certain sense of freedom in the film  the two main characters give up a life of normality to go crazy! They have the time of their lives; to them, it's almost as if it's not about the fact that they want to rob banks, than the fact that they just don't want to be a part of society. What a great idea for a film! It reminds me a bit of Terrence Malick's 1973 film BADLANDS. The editing is also phenomenal  I noticed that the editor was able to put things together in the editing room that would appear to (at least traditionally) not cut together  but somehow she managed. I was also impressed by the screenplay, which was enticing and poetic at the same time.",Bonnie and Clyde
370,j23091979,Pulp Fiction Eat Your Heart Out,10,11 February 2003,"This is one of the best movies that I have ever seen.  Bonnie and Clyde tells the story of a young couple who are in love and on the run.  They live in a surreal world where robbing banks, getting chased and random shootings are all part of their daily lives.  Bonnie is a daydreamer with a glint in her eye and Clyde is a criminal who wants the finer things in life. The scenery is shot extremely well and captures the wild, raw and untamed Texan countryside perfectly.  The contrast of old country style music and complete silence used to evoke the atmosphere in this movie is in my opinion on a par with Kubrick's, mastery of this particular art.  My advice to anyone considering to view this amazing film is what are you waiting for?  Watch it with an unbiased eye and you will be pleasantly surprised.",Bonnie and Clyde
371,kaitlincg95,Pretty Bland,4,1 June 2012,"Aside from the violence, this movie was really boring to me. There is nothing that stands out. I think that it might be a well known movie just for the fact that it's based on two well known people. Surely it's not known for being a well made film.Warren Beatty played a good glamorized Clyde Barrow. Not fantastic acting, but for at least a quarter of the movie he was amusing enough. Faye Dunaway, on the other hand, was kind of annoying. I only bring this up because I don't believe she was meant to be seen as obnoxious. (Not entirely, at least.) Her performance was mediocre.As for the rest of the characters, and the rest of the movie, I don't have much to say. I was completely underwhelmed and bored. The violence may have been enough to keep people interested back in the 60's, but these days we're so used to violence in films, it's really nothing special.",Bonnie and Clyde
372,will-255,Very Loose with the Facts,3,7 April 2004,"This film is irresponsible. I'm not talking about omissions because of the limitations of movie making. I'm talking about outright lies. I can almost forgive making stuff up about B&C since they were a couple of dirt bags, but I can't forgive making Frank Hamer (mispronounced in the movie) and other lawmen look like fools.Frank's service to society was quite remarkable. It was so remarkable that the justified slaughter of B&C was but a footnote to his illustrious career. And what of the officers and innocents killed or injured by the Barrow gang? The movie makes their loss seem like so much fun at the penny arcade. Director Penn should be ashamed.I doubt the positive reviewers of this film would be so quick to praise a movie that made Charlie Manson's group out to be a fun-loving bunch of misguided hippies. This is the exact sort of thing this movie did. The only difference is how old the crimes are. In fact in terms of the suffering they caused, the Barrow gang was worse than Manson. Those that glowingly praise this movie would be well served to crack a history book once in a while. I suggest Milner's The ""Lives and Times of Bonnie and Clyde.""If you do decide to read about B&C, you'll be surprised to find that some of the most interesting facts were left out of the movie. For example: They broke one of their buddies out of a major Texas prison from the outside. Clyde was a small Beaver-Cleaver-looking guy who deftly used a large machine gun (a Browning Automatic Rifle) because tommy guns, which are revered by Hollywood and used in this movie, could not reliably penetrate the steel of early 30s cars. And best of all, they really loved each other. All that lover's tension and sexual dysfunction in the movie is BS.The actors did a decent job. They probably didn't even know that the script had very little to do with Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker. Even if they did know, they probably wouldn't care. The casting was horrible, but hey, once you cast off the annoying constraints of what actually happened, who cares? If the movie had been titled Bob and Suzy, it would have been worth watching in its day. Even if it were, these days it would be a waste of time.",Bonnie and Clyde

Though the real Bonnie and Clyde probably weren't nearly as sympathetic characters, the portrayal is almost magical. Warren Beatty makes a wonderful Clyde, tough and criminal, but at the same time caring and soft.   Faye Dunaway is the small town Texas girl who expected more out of life.   You can see her in her pink outfit waiting tables and hating it.   She makes Bonnie someone who you can feel sorry for, but also someone you might like to be.   The acting is superb, the pacing great, and the cinematography amazing.   Never was a truer word spoken of the lives of the little people in the depression.",Bonnie and Clyde

The heroes are beautiful and that was a major controversy since the real Bonnie and Clyde were as ugly as their sins. probably the real Bonnie and Clyde would't recognize the scenery because the cameras make it look more beautiful though the banks and homes look real and may very well be. oh yes, the cars were in mint condition - until our heroes and the law get through with them . the social critics of the era said it was terrible to make these criminals appealing. BUT were those critics rooting for Cagney, Bogart and company to get killed ? Well...sometimes. BUt we don't for these two. I'm not sure why. Maybe its because Clyde isn't a 1930's tough guy. Yeah, I'm sure that's it. He's more of a scared bunny, with a temper who blames others for his errors and fully enjoying the notoriety of his actions. But are you really going to blame Warren Beatty ? Yeah, the critics said the movie was not real life. DUH Its a movie ! lol I was glad I snuck off to the theater to see it. Want reality ? try the photo session early in the movie. The poem is real, probably written by a journalist .

377,camadon,...and they killed people,8,19 January 2006,"From the first few shots of this film I could tell it would live up to everything I had heard about it. It opens with a close-up of Bonnie's (Dunaway) face, and with the use of some rapid cutting to different angles the viewer can get a sense that this woman as being bored and feeling confined by her small-town life. This pulls the audience in, immediately causing sympathy to be felt for this character. Although in real life Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow were cold-blooded murderers, this film portrays them as charismatic rebels, who steal from the rich and are compassionate to the poor. A way in which this is achieved is through the use music. When the Barrow Gang are in their car evading the ""laws"" there is the upbeat music of Flatt and Scruggs' ""Foggy Mountain Breakdown"" playing in the background. This lends to the nonchalant nature of violence in this film. Only when Clyde kills the bank teller in the beginning does he, or any of the characters aside from Blanche, show any remorse. From then on they don't look back in their life of crime; which ends in their deaths.Another instance, which causes the viewer to be sympathetic to Bonnie and Clyde, is how they treat the downtrodden people. They understand the sorrow the victims of the Depression feel, and they make it a point to help them out when they can; seen through their helping people take out their aggression on a bank sign, or by not taking the money of a poor farmer when they are robbing a bank.Whether it is the downplaying of the true nature of violence in the film, or the interspersing of the human element throughout, the viewer cannot help but associate themselves with these rebels. Although this was set during the Depression, it also reflected the time in which it was made; it reflects a lot of the mentality of the late sixties. I think that this is a film that not only can speak to the time in which it was made, but the themes present in it also carry through to today's generation. The sense of alienation and the act of rebellion are things that the youth of today both feel and strive for at some point or another.To top it all off, along with the wonderful way in which the characters, and themes are presented in this film there is great camera work. As I noted in the beginning with the introduction to Bonnie, there are other instances where the camera plays a role in the storytelling. There are many close-ups on guns, one in particular where Bonnie is stroking the barrel of Clyde's gun, portraying the sexual tension felt between the two characters. My favorite shot of the film is the very last scene where the camera is looking through a gunshot in the glass of the getaway car in which Bonnie and Clyde were killed. In this shot the viewer can see the Texas Rangers looking down on the lifeless forms of Bonnie and Clyde. This gives a great sense of finality to the film, which ends in one last act of violence, but in this case the viewer sees it as a negative act of violence. This is due to the nature of their murder; by a huge barrage of bullets, pocking their bodies with large gunshot wounds.All in all this is a wonderful film, not only showcasing good film-making stylistically, but also a good story to go along with it.",Bonnie and Clyde
378,jkyller,aesthetics and politics,8,22 January 2006,"Bonnie and Clyde marked a turning point in American Cinema that would lead to the development of a more artistic and auteur driven Hollywood scene up until the end of the 1970's and the rise of conservative ideology to dominant status. The movie was one of the first of many to display an influence of the French on technique and form, yet it's ideology really set off much more debate and controversy than did it's style. As J. Hoberman points out in his book The Dream Life, ""Historical context overdetermined the movie's reception."" He's not talking about the issue of fictionalizing or romanticizing history in the film itself, although there are certainly problems in doing such, but the historical context of American society within which the film was released. Looking at the film today without having personally been alive in the sixties makes my reaction to it much different, considering that I am not embodying a the same sense of zeitgeist that I would have if my contemporary settings were the same. Obviously, there is the task of historicizing the work in an attempt to not only understand it better, but also the reaction that was had to it. I can imagine what it would be like to have seen this movie when it was first released, but there are of course limits to that also. Nevertheless, there are themes in the movie that still exist today, and perhaps approach a certain level of universality in recent American society. The generational gap, of course much newer and more self-conscious in the 1960's but still present today, can be identified with still, or the polarized worlds of domesticity and constant traveling on the road. The test of time is certainly an interesting topic, and really begs questions pertaining to the politics of aesthetics. Bonnie and Clyde was different from classic Hollywood cinema because it broke from stylistic frameworks and the supposed invisible cinematic style. The opening scene is obviously stylized, with the close ups on the lips and the unconventional framing shots or lack of exposition. The most obvious scene that employs stylistic effects such as the filter, slow motion and disjointed cuts is the picnic scene with the families. Similar to the way that Brecht employed alienation effects in his plays, the effect that these overly stylized forms of editing and filming change the dynamics of viewing the film. The consciousness of the viewers is no longer assumed to be usurped by the film itself and distance is created between the film and the audience. The audience is more conscious of the film existing apart from reality, and more conscious of being in the act of watching a movie that does not completely represent reality. This is really a liberating thing for a filmmaker because he or she could theoretically wash his or her hands of any undesirable effects that the content might have. The fact that movie goers, especially at the time of its release, were not use to this type of viewing experience might make the issue not quite so clean, but it is an argument in favor of this type of film. The issue of violence, for example, is what caused much of the controversy over the film. If the main critique is that the identification of movie goers with Bonnie and Clyde will cause a romantification of violence and its subsequent proliferation against authority, then the critic misses the artistic quality of the film. There is an art of creating a film that has narrative, but has enough auteristic style so as to present the narrative in a way that will be less likely to result in a subconscious identification with the characters and an embodiment of their ideology. As Hoberman said, the film was really granted much more ideological ramifications than most likely intended to because of the historical context within which it was released.",Bonnie and Clyde

380,qazxswcde,We rob banks.,8,24 May 2006,"Bonnie and Clyde easily has one of the most powerful and breathtakingly shocking scenes ever. All great movies have powerful scenes. This of course does not mean that all movies with powerful scenes are great, but luckily for Bonnie and Clyde, it is close enough.The acting throughout the film is very good, most of the time. The Music is effective, most of the time. The cinematography is beautiful and interesting, most of the time. The main exception to that one being one sequence where the director uses a filter on the camera that makes it seem out of place with the rest of the film. I think i can see why that decision was made, but it is ultimately ineffective and borderline annoying.The story of Bonnie and Clyde is already an interesting one, and the screenwriter's changes make it much better for film. The writer and director make interesting choices that put humor and sorrow and the events that the Barrow gang partake in. The events mostly help lead up to the incredible finale. It seems like the filmmaker's feelings about the whole story might be mixed and is inconsistent in some parts, but I think there is a message to be found if you want one. One other thing that is notable is the film debut of Gene Wilder who offers a goofy performance as a (sort of) victim of the gang. His scenes are priceless.Anyway, this film deserves to be seen, mostly for its historical importance in influencing modern cinema action violence (which for some reason I didn't mention), but don't go too far out of your way to see it. Maybe put it on some ""to do list"", one that you'll actually get to.",Bonnie and Clyde
381,seraptoramanoglu,Nothing really convince me in this movie!!,1,29 November 2006,"Before I saw the movie, I expect at least a convincing story about the love between Bonnie and Clyde, although I do not like the stories and movies that glorify the violence and show it funny and laughable. Instead, I got so much bored while I was watching it even from the starting scene. I could not see any real personality in characters ( bad or good), neither the signs of a great love between two main gang members. I just think that this movie was made with a serious confusion in mind and it was made in rush. Otherwise, the aim must be the opportunistic use of a story whose important details were left out to make it more sympathetic to the audience. I neither understand Clyde's sexual or psychological problems, nor saw any hints of how he was able to solve it in the movie. The director must have thought that towards the end, he should better solve his sexual problems with great love he felt for Bonnie!? Security forces look so clumsy, and I also did not understand why Bonnie and Clyde are considered as heroes by some ordinary farmers, as I did not see any donations from the gang to them! May be the movie was liked by many people because of Bonnie's dresses that change almost in each scene! She looks glamorous with those jackets that are supposed to be quite uncomfortable for robbery and using guns!!! By the way, isn't it the dressing style from 1960's???",Bonnie and Clyde

383,group1850,My favorite film of all time,10,25 November 2001,"I enjoyed this more than any other film I have ever seen on first cinematic viewing. I also think it is the greatest film of all time. I also think it is the moment when cinema came of age, grew up, escaped from the grey stultifying fog of censorship and modern cinema was born. There followed a golden era between 67 and 79 of adult, intelligent, relatively uncensored movies. By 1980 those accountants won out and things dumbed down and commercialised. There are three elements to the film Violence, Love and Humour add to that great Realism.  Faye Dunnaway lights up the screen as possibly the most beautiful woman in the world at the time.On re-viewing it is also exceptionally funny but in a way that has a wonderful actuality to it, never detracting from the gripping realism and tension. This is very, very difficult to achieve.  In terms of violence it set new standards and has a magnificent climactic ending that is a perfect resolution to the story. If they had been strapped into the electric chair or had escaped from martyrdom it would have too  gruelling, too grim, too unjust. As it is, the ending seems mercifully quick, both just and appropriate. A script minded person reading the original true-life story of Bonnie and Clyde would see it instantly as Classic film material - great characters, great action, great resolution. Two virtually forgotten 1930's outlaws were hereby made famous forever. By comparison the even better 1930's gangster tale of Dillinger has never been remotely well served by cinema. I think the film should be in the top ten but the sociopathic violence, the murders of the heros ( I think they killed about 13 people) seem to be taken literally by a significant number of viewers and weigh against it.So many good and ground breaking decisions were made in the making of this movie - how that turned out to be the case should be a case study for other movie makers. Why is it that this particular glorification of sociopathic violence has such poetry and charisma? Finally 1967 was the year of years in decadent, hedonistic western culture - the year of years in pop music and arguably film making and this movie seems to crown it all.",Bonnie and Clyde
384,d-barr-772-174135,broad impact,9,29 September 2010,"Lot's has already been said about this movie. The impact of the film at the time went far beyond the sex and violence. First, while Beatty was already a movie star, this film catapulted all its cast members into stardom - Faye Dunaway, Gene Hackman, Michael J. Pollard, Estelle Parsons and Gene Wilder all became successful through this film. The music was also highly influential, kicking off a revival of bluegrass music. And the film highly influenced fashion with a revival of thirties-style clothes.Another important aspect of the film is the successful mixture of drama and humor. It's a funny movie despite the horror and dread.FInally, although it may not be polite to say so on the day of his death, there were always disputes about how much Arthur Penn actually controlled the final cut.

387,micael-santos-gerosa,Baby boomer trash treated as a classic,2,14 October 2020,"By reading some reviews here and some other through google I thought this was going to be an amazing movie. Although I'm a history buff and love realism above all else, I'm not against taking some freedoms with real characters for the sake of drama development. But this movie goes far beyond that. It treats two sociopaths as a happy go lucky couple just making poetry and enforcing anti-establishment justice. It's clearly a move to relate the characters to the young audience watching this movie in the sixties. Most of the positive comments about this movie are related to it's ground breaking cinematography, which does look impressive for the time, and the violence, just because it has some blood spilling. Perhaps it was shocking for the time, but I find the brutality of Once Upon a Time in the West far more appealing and engaging than what this movie offers. I also happened to have watched The Highwaymen before this movie, and it is painful to see that movie suffering so many bad reviews, when it took the subject far more seriously than this hippie adventure comedy. The worst part is people calling the Netflix take as boring and not having enough scenes with Bonnie and Clyde. If you want an awsome brutal story of a deadly couple, just watch Natural Born Killers.",Bonnie and Clyde
388,javichurches,it's worth watching it,7,31 March 2006,"I have just spend a funny two hours watching this film.I disagree with other critics stating that Bonnie & Clyde was factually inaccurate. It probably was, but I don't see why should that be negative. Even when films are based in true stories they need to be adapted (otherwise they would be news, not films). People going to cinema don't want to know exactly what happened to whoever, but they want to spend a pleasure and excitement time, and I think this film gets it. Anyone wanting to know accurately the facts of bonnie and Clyde's real life may go to the library and buy a book about it.What I found amusing about this film is the way the action goes, and the way the music surrounds the action taking place. Loud gunshooting noises reminded me about Morricone's soundtrack. This is not a perfect film, but I liked it, I enjoyed particularly a scene which is not very famous, the one when Clyde is teaching Bonnie how to fire. They are aiming at a tire, but we are after that tire, and I felt I was being shooted.This film obviously musn't serve as an example of conduct. Bonnie & Clyde were two bandit and assassins.

390,tkasup1984,Great Classic Film,8,18 January 2006,"Bonnie and Clyde was a very influential film for its time. It combined violence, sex, and glorified criminals. This was one of the first films of this era to break all of the rules that Hollywood had imposed on films, and paved the way for every film made during the era of New American Cinema. It portrays Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow as charming young adults that are rebelling against ""normal"" culture. These characters were turned into youth heroes for the late 60's. This film was more of a commentary of the 60's than about two Depression era bank robbers. The major theme in the movie that I really liked and felt drove the film was the yearning for celebrity. This film is about two young criminals that strive to be famous. Through the course of the film, they rob and kill their way into the hearts of the American people. They were seen as folk heroes in the film, and were often helped by local town's people, until the conclusion of the film where they are betrayed by C.W.'s father. Their search for celebrity was ultimately achieved when Bonnie's poem was published in newspapers. I felt that including this poem in the film was great. I loved how it told the whole story of Bonnie and Clyde, and even predicts the ending of the film. This sets up the end of the film wonderfully.The end of this film was something that I anxiously looked forward to. This was not because I disliked the film in any way, but because I knew the actual fate of Bonnie and Clyde and I wanted to see how it would be portrayed through this film. This part of the film was somewhat historically accurate, in the fact that the actual Bonnie and Clyde were ambushed while in their car, and were each shot numerous times. This was an ultra-violent ending to, for its time, an ultra-violent film. What this film lacks in historical accuracy it more than makes up for in sheer excitement and action. This film was a nonstop chase scene/gun fight, with a love story thrown in the mix for good measure. I personally loved the quick cuts between shots, extreme close-ups and the overall fast pace of the film. There was not a moment in the film that I was bored. Overall, I really enjoyed this film. The all-star cast including Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, a young Gene Hackman, and always funny Gene Wilder, was what drove this film. I highly recommend Bonnie and Clyde to anyone that is in the mood for a relentless action film. I feel that this film can still compete with the action films of today.",Bonnie and Clyde
391,CMurphy08,Horrible portrayal of 2 low-life criminals,6,20 January 2006,"My reaction to this film is very dichotomous. The film was revolutionary in the way that it was filmed: it shattered a longstanding code of film-making wherein studios were discouraged to include violent and sexual material. The film is known among film scholars as the genesis of a period of American film known as the Hollywood Renaissance. Many agree that the film was groundbreaking, with new film techniques and risqué content never before seen on the big screen. This aside, the film was sickening in the way it portrayed the notorious thugs Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow. Most people who see the film know that Bonnie and Clyde were real criminals whose crime spree shook Midwestern America in the early 1930s. Perhaps many people don't realize the scope of their crimes, however. By the time they were shot down by the FBI in 1934, the five criminals portrayed in the film had committed an extensive number of heinous crimes. Collectively, the group was thought to have murdered three police officers and four civilians; kidnapped a chief of police, a sheriff and two innocent people; and committed countless robberies and automobile thefts. It is clear that these people were low-life cop killers and thieves. So why they were portrayed in such a heroic manor is beyond me. Some film scholars cite the reason for this shocking content as a social commentary on the rebellious attitudes of 1960s pop culture. This is a poor justification. The film undoubtedly contributed to the advent of popular films and video games in which cop killing and grand larceny is encouraged. Such a movement is a scar on our society.My opinion of the film would be drastically different had the group been portrayed as the antagonists of the story. The film would have been much had the police been portrayed as the heroes in the film, working diligently to catch the group of homicidal criminals. Bonnie and Clyde would have been less likable and less sexualized. This approach, however, would have been much less groundbreaking and would have ended up being a typical detective movie popular in that period. Hollywood executives, as we would expect, clearly opted for the plot that would sell the most tickets.The point to be made here is that Bonnie and Clyde were villainous murderers who had no regard for society or the law. They murdered innocent people and civil servants. The couple and those who joined them on their reign of terror are undeserving of the way they were portrayed in this film.",Bonnie and Clyde
392,willow1989,One of my favourites,10,14 April 2006,"I saw this movie when it first came out when I was 19, and was completely and absolutely enthralled - I then went to see it a further 12 times (unusual in those days to see a film so many times before the invention of videos - twice was a lot!). I think I can say I knew the film word for word and if asked could act out any part starting with Bonny's first words ""Hey Boy"".This was a dynamic movie because it was so real - violence of that sort had not been seen much in cinema before 1969 except for war films and horror movies, and I remember the first time seeing it at the Odeon Leicester Square (London) and at the end the whole audience, and it was packed with people, sat in complete and utter silence as the credits went up - no-one left their seat they were SO stunned! And the funky music is still a favourite of mine....Loved it and still do",Bonnie and Clyde

They should have shot her in the head the moment she showed up.",Bonnie and Clyde

Perhaps it was the script or the direction.The performance of Estelle Parsons as Blanche was especially pathetic.As far as being historically accurate, well, the movie miserably failed on this score as well (especially the ending). Many of the true facts were significantly altered. I see no need to alter the facts -- the truth is quite compelling and dramatic.",Bonnie and Clyde

To anyone who hasn't seen it and enjoys watching suspense and edge of your seat movies that grabs your interest and doesn't let go, this is the movie for you.  Faye Dunaway is absolutely gorgeous and really makes you feel something for her character.  Warren Beatty gives an astounding performance as well.

I love watching this movie, it is funny, old fashioned, and brilliantly twisted. I think the best part of watching this movie is knowing that majority of it was true. It's crazy to believe how long people got away with such chaos. I tried watching different versions but nothing seems to compare. Faye Dunaway just takes your breath away with her acting and beauty. Her and Warren Beatty had the most wonderful chemistry. Even though this movie may have some years on it, Arthur Penn does a superb job taking you out of this world and into their world!

399,cmaine12,Bonnie and Clyde - The Fast Life of Bonnie and Clyde (Biography),10,12 December 2013,"Bonnie and Clyde - A somewhat loved up account of the crime career of the highly notoriously violent bank robbing pair and their gang.Besides being an substantially interesting film, ""Bonnie and Clyde"" was an essential 1950's milestone film in a number of methods. Its aggressive finishing assisted to speed up the end of the old Hayes rule, which had been a serious restrictor of creative freedom; and it assisted form the '60's image of the anti-hero.For these factors it obtained a great cope of judgement as well as commendation.The image is a melange of creative certificate and traditional precision. The entertainment of the Depression-era look is fantastic. (It's done in an unostentatious way, however. One seems it rather than particularly observing it.) While some rights are taken with the tale, a affordable quantity jibes with the essential points.But certainly there is some romanticization here. And of course the actual Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker were not nearly as eye-catching as Beatty and Dunaway.Such an extraordinary pair, who ran riot in the south west of the USA for a long time. The movie is great and the story line and movie setting is spot on.I also read this great eBook recently (The Fast Life of Bonnie and Clyde), check it out here by copying and pasting link into your web browser: http://authl.it/B00H8J457A",Bonnie and Clyde
400,jradou812,Bonnie and Clyde (1967),8,21 September 2014,"The last scene of Bonnie and Clyde, the last words are not spoken by either one. ""I got a flat tire, and I ain't got no spare, "" is the last vocal words, however, Malcom ducks under the truck, a flock of birds flies skyward from the bushes, there is movement and noise from the bushes, and then the blood bath begins and when Bonnie and Clyde look at each other, all is spoken with their eyes and emotions. During the scene mentioned above, the bullets and gunfire is amplified to startle you for the ambush and to give the seriousness of what is happening. Bonnie looks at Clyde saying, I love you, I forgive you, and there is no other place I would rather be. Clyde looks at her as to say, I am sorry for putting you through this, I wish it could have been different and we will be together forever. The story shows true love, as Clyde would tell you that he is ""no lover boy."" Bonnie stays with him through his faults and even though he puts her in harm's way and gives her a way out, he knows she truly loves him by staying. Having said this, I would like to share my experience of this movie with you. It is more of a reflection of their lives and not a true documentary. It is a love story about Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway) and Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty). They hook up after Clyde is casing out Bonnie's mother's car. She notices him from her window. She is standing there shielded by the glass completely naked. During the late 60's when this movie was released, nudity in films was minimal. Bonnie is nude in this scene and you do not see ""too much,"" however your mind fills in the rest. She is flirting with him and soon runs down the stairs and out of her mother's house to leave with him. After a few botched robberies in which some people get hurt and killed, Bonnie and Clyde gain their reputations fast. The gang picks up by adding Buck, Clyde's brother and Buck's wife Blanche. The woman do not like each other but tolerate on another because of the men in their lives. The movie also helped catapult the carriers of Gene Hackman who plays Clyde's brother Buck. A very young Gene Wilder as Eugene Gizzard, who's car is stolen and he is later dumped off because he is a mortician and this reminds Bonnie of their ultimate demise. They are pursued by lawman from Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. A lawman does catch up to them, however instead of killing him, they have fun and take pictures with him as to mock the justice system and let people know they are ""good people.""It is not until Bonnie writes to the paper about Clyde, that he can really consummate their love. According to internet posts, the impotence problem was put in to help the audience gain sympathy for Clyde. They are criminals but they are also human beings. At the last bank robbery, they allow an old farmer to keep his money and take the banks. Nominated for many awards, it is a fun loving movie that will warm your heart and chill your bones at the same time. Not all of this film based on truth but is a reflection of the outlaws Bonnie and Clyde.",Bonnie and Clyde
401,zacariah-13826,"A great movie, unfairly panned by those expecting a documentary",10,21 June 2019,"I first saw this film when I was a mere 22, and now, more than 50 years later, I'm amazed at how well it still holds up. As many others have noted, it was a piece of breakthrough cinema that owed much to the French nouvelle vague: Godard's Breathless was an obvious inspiration. I was troubled then, and remain so, by the criticisms that it glamorized murderers, that it used beautiful people in the lead roles when the real characters were quite otherwise, and basically, that it fictionalized history. The movie does not purport to be a portrait of reality: The music by Flatt & Scruggs ought to give that away. Rather, it is a picture of how the underclass of the worst years of the Depression-and there was a lot more of them than it's comfortable to admit-saw outlaws like Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, and yes, Bonnie and Clyde, and how their exploits resonated with folks who had been dispossessed, and used, by the banks and the greed of the upper one percent. Violence, as Rap Brown so famously said, really is as American as cherry pie (he should have said apple), and so long as so many Americans choose to deny that fact, I believe there is little hope that we will ever outgrow it. Bonnie and Clyde is a very sobering reflection of where we were in 1967-68, in the midst of Vietnam, and the accumulating series of assassinations, and it is at the same time a wonderful reminder of how little we've advanced.",Bonnie and Clyde

It was so far unbelievable, untrue and some of the worst acting ever! The movies of the '67 awards were far better than this! This pile of garbage wasn't even in competition with those other amazing movies such as The Graduate and In The Heat Of The Night (which for all those that tout this as being so innovative with the violence, there was violence in ITHOTN!). It was unwatchable and wish that I could get back my 2 hours. GARBAGE!!! Wish I could give this a negative rating. Maybe use a fact checker, I'm sure they were around in 1967.

405,mhaseck,a couple with guns and a lot of free time,8,19 January 2006,"The movie that we watched today was a classic film about a couple of bank robbers, not just two males. The clout behind the film is that they were stars because of the style and the publicity that they received. Bonnie Parker was most likely a large reason for the success that this film has. Her dress as well as the overall way that she carries herself in the film is remarkable. The idea that a young couple could be so entangled in love for each other that no matter what they were doing was making them happy during the time period when this movie takes place. Set in the 1930's when the depression was hitting the United States but mainly the south and Sunbelt states where our main characters move in and out of county lines is more present in the minds of the viewer then the violence that is going on. The acting was good as well as the costumes the characters were wearing. The only thing that did not sit right with my personal viewing was that the sounds were slightly off, most likely due to the lack of top dollar production techniques for surround sound today.My favorite part of the film is when we get to meet CW Moss's father. At this point in the film we seen them (the remaining members of the barrel gang) rob and elude all forms of law enforcement. The reason for me liking this part is because he has instilled inside of him core American values. He hates the idea that his son is robbing banks and living an illegal life as well as the ink tattoo on his chest. The father dose not stop there he invites them inside and feeds them but shows the boy his discontent with his he found lifestyle. This part I feel contains the message in the film about you can live the fast life but eventually it is going to catch up with you. This is just my guess and the feeling I had during that scene in the movie and it stuck with me.Today's movies critics would say that there were too many car chases as well as gun fights, however I say that they are only repetitive because of the lack of digital effects to make them each different. The production of this film was very good for the mid sixty's and was probably very well liked by the youth of America due to way Bonnie and Clyde treated law enforcement or laws as Clyde liked to label them. Overall I would give the film a B or B- and it could be watched by anyone that would like to film classic with good acting a beautiful actress.",Bonnie and Clyde
406,KeithBrando,They called this ultra-violent?,9,19 January 2006,"After reading a good amount of press from around the time of the release and literature looking back on the release of Bonnie and Clyde I found myself comparing the reactions of people watching the movie in 1967 and myself, watching the movie for the first time in 2006. Aside from the pair's lead-laden demise, the film was pretty standard in terms of the frequency and intensity of the violence. So what does that mean for us and our flock of movies today? What would Bosley Crowther think of a movie like Kill Bill? The vast majority of our modern films contain vast amounts of violence and we don't even think about it anymore. This is the norm in film these days. The violence in this film originally appealed to people because they had seldom seen anything so brutal and it really was an event to go and see this sexified (in its own way) non-stop bloodbath. Ironically the people most against this type of film and art in general, conservatives that is, are the very people intent on building up our military, executing prisoners, and going into other countries and showing them our own brand of justice, and other forms of actual violence, not the fake kind that is only captured on film.The Renaissance that this film began was not free from the buy and sell system against which is often seen as the valiant if doomed opponent. People wanted to but tickets to these types of movies so these were the movies that were made. Directors may have had unprecedented creative control that perhaps has yet to be matched but that was only because these singular vision films were moving tickets. This is of course not to say that we as film fans are so lucky that this time existed, but we should all realize that the creative influx was facilitated by the very studios who are now steering film in the direction that it has been going for the past 30 or so years. That said, looking at this film from my 21st century view I can see a whole lot of worth even in our own times. In terms of film I really love this movie because it has no frills, it just says what it needs to say and does what it needs to do. It lacks the standard issue, oft out of place symphonic soundtrack with perfectly timed flares from the strings to tell exactly when to feel what emotions. The music is very sparse but perfectly used. The actors all give excellent performances, while the character of C.W. Moss, played by Michael J. Pollard was the most peculiar of the bunch. C.W. seems to represent the rebels of the sixties, following some kind of rebellion that really seems to have no real message or unifying direction. When explaining the Barrow gang to his father in the kitchen he really doesn't know what he's doing he just knows it's pretty cool. Without knowing the political and social context in which this movie was released I would probably have a similar take on the movie.",Bonnie and Clyde
407,intlfilmketeer,"Disappointment, primarily",4,14 March 2006,"Sadly, from the stilted opening dialogue that crammed the one-dimensional characters down my throat, I found that this movie was falling short of my expectations. I had heard that Faye Dunaway's costumes were lovely (and they were), but the movie is supposed to be good besides that. In reality, the script and direction (late 60s American experimental, usually looking amateurish) simplified the characters into boring players, and poorly framed dialogue and action frequently were frequently confusing. For 3/4 of the the movie I thought Clyde was peckerless. Downright boring, that's what this movie is. The only good thing was the elfin cheer of C.W. Moss. I guess in its time the film was well-received, but it doesn't stand up to the test of time. Remarkably similar to the disappointments of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", another horribly scripted film that people still bandy about as an example of good cinema.",Bonnie and Clyde
