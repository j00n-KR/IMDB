0,Leofwine_draca,"Belated, and unnecessary, sequel",4,18 July 2017,"RETURN OF XANDER CAGE is the third in the XXX franchise and a film that sees Vin Diesel returning to the fold. With a variety of settings and made as a collaboration between Hollywood, Canada, and China, this is a truly international co-production with a mix of nationalities propping up the cast. Sadly, it's a film as silly as its predecessors, if not more so. Vin Diesel and a bunch of thieves are tracking down a rogue satellite and come up against corrupt figures after it for their own purposes.The film seems heavily modelled on the FAST & FURIOUS franchise also starring Diesel. There's not as much action as I was expecting, but that which does occur is overly dominated by wirework, stunt doubles, and lame CGI effects. The cast is the most interesting thing about this and all of them have funny one-liners; particular favourites of mine include Donnie Yen, Tony Jaa, and Rory McCann, although none of them have much to do as this is very much the Vin Diesel Show. Others appearing include an annoying geek girl, Ruby Rose (who played the chief assassin in JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 2), a miscast Toni Collette, and returning franchise actors Ice Cube and Samuel L. Jackson. I was hoping for some good fight scenes, but they tend to be over-edited into oblivion, with only one stand-out moment with Yen. The rest is a noisy blur.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
1,SnoopyStyle,"Donnie Yen great, plenty of action, could be worst",6,20 June 2017,"Someone uses NSA tool Pandora's Box to bring down a satellite and kill Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson). Xiang (Donnie Yen) attacks new NSA head Jane Marke (Toni Collette). She recruits Xander Cage (Vin Diesel) to return to the XXX program. NSA agent Becky Clearidge (Nina Dobrev) is a techie. Xander recruits his own team including nature-loving sniper Adele Wolff (Ruby Rose). Xander tracks down Xiang and Serena Unger (Deepika Padukone) who turn out to be former XXX.Donnie Yen is great and Ruby Rose is not bad either. I didn't really notice Tony Jaa. It's great to bring everybody back. At least, the franchise now has a chance. The McGuffin of Pandora's Box is a little muddled. Script is not the strength of this franchise and this movie continues that tradition. There is plenty of action and some of them are actually fun. Vin Diesel is Vin Diesel. Nina Dobrev is not good comic relief. She should be one of the hot assassins and a real comedian should take her role. I won't recommend this but it could have been worst and the franchise may be salvageable.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
2,Prismark10,Back in the cage,5,6 May 2017,"Vin Diesel was vying to be the new 21st Century James Bond character as extreme sports action star turned super agent Xander Cage. Despite the success of the first film, Diesel skipped the sequel.The film begins with Gibbons (Jackson) trying to recruit footballer Neymar to the xXx team when a descending satellite crashes on them.The Mcguffin is a high tech Pandora's Box that can control and crash satellites orbiting the Earth. It has been stolen from the CIA office by four highly skilled operatives led by Xiang (Donny Yen.)Xander Cage (Vin Diesel) is sought out to retrieve the box and asked to assemble his own crew. Cage finds out that Xiang also used to be part of the xXx program and he stole the device to prevent its misuse.The plot is hackneyed and also rather daft. The film has enough entertaining set pieces to give it momentum but you feel that with the multi national and diverse cast that the producers were aiming for a more inferior version of the Fast and Franchise type film and this is what you get.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
3,nogodnomasters,There's only rebel and tyrants,10,9 August 2017,"OPENING PLOT SPOILER: The film opens, as if it was a sequel to ""Gravity"" with Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) biting the dust in the first scene. Cage is NOT being handled by him as the IMDb movie blurb claims. He now works for Jane Marke (Toni Collette) someone we dislike from the start. His task is to recover ""Pandora's Box"" the cliché device that can hack into anything, looking like the box I had to steal cable. Xander (Vin Diesel) assembles his own team to recover the box. They go to some ""bad guy"" island in PI where it is filled with beautiful women dancing. Do these places really exist? Come close? The film has over-the-top action with stunt men needing stunt men. It utilizes corny lines like, ""That's what she said"" and ""The things I do for my country."" But they make them work. This is a younger crowd production. There is some message about governments, patriotism, and control, but more for entertainment's sake than anything else. Ice Cube as Darius Stone has a cameo and sets up for a sequel.I loved Nina Dobrev as Becky. She needs to be in any sequel 5 stars for being a fun action packed popcorn film where you can check your brain at the door.Guide: Minimal F-words. No nudity, but plenty of bikinis. Implied sex.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
4,kosmasp,He's back,7,24 June 2017,"Just the (re)introduction of Xander Cage is insane. At the very start of the movie, you get a fun cameo (especially if you are into soccer or football, depending on where you're from and what you call it), but then it's Cage. And if you mind him taking a ""leap of faith"" (let's call it that) and not getting hurt, doing a stunt ""drive"" that can be called insane, for a reason that is amusing at best ... well then this movie is not for you.But if you can just lay back and enjoy this for what it is, you will have a lot of fun. I mean a lot of fun! I mean just the fact you have Tony Jaa and Donnie Yen in the same movie is amazing. You could call this ""trying to get as many different demographics"" into your movie or diversity (also a Bollywood actress and many other people get put in here). It's up to you: Fun ride or incredible insane? And why is that a bad thing? Don't expect a story or a movie that takes itself seriously. This knows what it is and winks constantly at the audience. On this level it does work as it should ...",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
5,Tweekums,Good silly action as Vin Diesel returns to the xXx franchise,7,15 October 2018,"When Augustus Gibbons, the head of the xXx programme, is killed by a group that has stolen a device known as Pandora's Box, which enables them to de-orbit a satellite to his precise location, top former agent Xander Cage is brought back into action. He is given a team of soldiers for supports but demands that he be allowed to choose his own people. Leads take them to the Philippines where they first meet the man who stole the device and his people... it soon becomes apparent that not everything is as it seems.It is hard to deny that this is very silly but if you are in the right mood it is also a lot of fun. There is plenty of action from start to finish. This is nicely varied with fights, shoot-outs, car chases, a bike chase (on water!) and explosions. For the most part this action is really exciting although at times it is too obvious that events are CGI 'enhanced'. It was good to have Vin Diesel back even though we were told in the previous film that he'd died... not really a problem as we didn't see him die. The rest of the cast are pretty solid; most notably Donnie Yen who provides the films best fight scenes. There are a good number of laughs to be had although many of these come from fairly cheesy moments. Overall I wouldn't say this is a must see but if you want decent brain-in-neutral action it is rather fun.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
6,ma-cortes,Once again the action sports hero is recruited to destroy a weapon known as Pandora's Box.,5,11 October 2018,"Mediocre following about one army man incarnated by Vin Diesel and with guns, girls, global domination and intense action scenes .

7,BandSAboutMovies,Motorcycles on waves,4,11 April 2020,"Despite 12 years between movies, Xander Cage being supposedly killed off and mixed reviews, this movie film grossed over $346 million worldwide on an $85 million budget, making it the highest-grossing film of the entire franchise.One of the reasons why this movie did so well is because it has an international cast, like Donnie Yen (Ip-Man) as Xiang, a rival xXx agent; Indian actress Deepika Padukone; Kris Wu, who was in the Chinese/South Korean boy band EXO, Australian actress Ruby Rose; Tony Jaa (Ong Bak), Canadian actress Nina Dobrev; British actor Rory McCann; British actress Hermione Corfield; American football player Tony Gonzales and British MMA star Michael Bisping. Ice Cube also shows in at the end in a cameo as Darius Stone from the second film.This one starts off with Augustus Gibbons (Samuel Jackson) and a Jason Bourne-like character being killed by a falling satellite and doesn't ever let up, with such insanity as fighting a government base to give the people cable and racing motorcycles across giant waves. Yes, this is a movie that has absolutely no interest in reality and exists only to entertain you.Jaa and Yen are two of the best martial arts-based actors in the world, so this movie features plenty of fights, as you'd hope. Sadly, Jet Li dropped out of the picture, but that may have been too much.Of course they're planning another xXx movie and I have no issue at all with this development.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
8,zardoz-13,In the Xander Zone!!!,7,30 January 2017,"An amusing catalogue of B-movie clichés from start to finish, ""Eagle Eye"" director D.J. Caruso's ""xXx: Return of Xander Cage,"" the long-awaited sequel to Rob Cohen's ""xXx"" (2002), isn't quite as exhilarating as the original. Nevertheless, everybody looks like they had a blast making this predictable, often preposterous nonsense that refuses to take itself seriously during its 107-minute running time. If you've seen both the original ""xXx"" as well as ""xXx: State of the Union"" (2005) with Ice-Cube, then you won't be surprised by what happens or who happens to be in what happens in this stunt-laden extravaganza. Nevertheless, ""xXx: Return of Xander Cage"" qualifies as an above-average epic owing to its charismatic cast, ""Titanic"" lenser Russell Carpenter's breathtaking cinematography, the bravura editing of Vince Filippone & Jim Page who cut together the Robert Downey & Val Kilmer thriller ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,"" and director D.J. Caruso's adrenaline-laced pacing. This outlandish, over-the-top, triumph of style over substance never wears out its welcome and occasionally delivers something wholly original for an action epic. A classic scene finds our heroes and heroine playing a game of hot potato with live hand grenades as they sit around a table. They hurl the hand grenades back and forth among themselves so the grenades glance off the tabletop like tennis balls, and then they snatch them before they explode. Later, Diesel and Deepika swap pistol and knife back and forth during a showdown. The premise of ""xXx 3"" differs from ""xXx."" A villain who can convert a geostationary satellite into a tactical weapon that he can crash like a bomb from space is as far-fetched as it is imaginative. Good guys and the bad guys alike make impressive entrances. A brawny, heavily tattooed Vin Diesel reprises his role as the eponymous legend, and Samuel L. Jackson joins him as his scar-faced superior Augustus Gibbons. The remainder of the robust cast, including Kris Wu, Ruby Rose, Tony Jaa, Nina Dobrev, Rory McCann, Toni Collette, Hermione Corfield, and Neymar Jr., create characters with a sense of personality. Seen recently in ""Rogue One, A Star Wars Story,"" Yen steals ""xXx 3"" with his hyperbolic martial arts skills which are indisputably spectacular. For the record, ""xXx"" came out in 2002, and it has taken ""xXx 3"" about fifteen years to follow it up, with greater emphasis on tongue-in-cheek humor than violence. The third installment in the Columbia Pictures franchise makes ""xXx"" appear serious with straightforward shenanigans in Eastern Europe against an army of former Soviet soldiers that christened themselves 'Anarchy 99.' After Xander Cage defeated these murderous dastards, he vanished to parts unknown. Officially, in ""xXx 2,"" Xander was pronounced dead. Now, Caruso and Frazier show us that rather than six feet under, Xander Cage has been hiding out in the shimmering Dominican Republic. Mind you, Triple-X hasn't been performing the kind of high-profile stunts, like plunging Senator Dick Hotchkiss' red Corvette off a bridge in the original, which might attract attention to his whereabouts. Indeed, going into hiding has curbed some of Xander's grandiosity, but he hasn't forsaken his sense of audacity. He pirates a cable television feed of the World Cup Championship to disadvantaged fishermen and basks in their adulation.Meantime, Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson of ""The Hateful Eight"") struggles to persuade Brazilian soccer star Neymar Jr., to join the xXx organization, but one of those crashing satellites obliterates Gibbons. Not long afterward, the CIA acquires a sophisticated gadget, ominously termed 'Pandora's Box,' that enables the user to crash satellites. No sooner has the government acquired that device than a group of thieves, led by Xiang (Donnie Yen of the ""IP Man"" trilogy) and his sidekick Serena Unger (Deepika Padukone of ""Happy New Year""), with Talon (Tony Jaa of ""Ong Bak 2"") and Hawk (Michael Bisping of ""The Anomaly"") in tow, burst into CIA Headquarters and steal Pandora's Box. Gibbons' successor, Jane Marke (Toni Collette of ""Muriel's Wedding""), summarizes their predicament, ""We need someone who can move like them, fight like them."" This time Marke tries the same strategy that succeeded for Gibbons when he recruited Cage in the first outing. Similarly, Cage sees through the ruse and agrees to tangle not only with Xiang and his people but also recover Pandora's Box. When Marke assigns an elite Special Forces group with Paul Donovan (newcomer Tony Gonzalez) in charge, Cage dismisses them in contemptuous fashion and recruits his own trustworthy team. He summons lesbian assassin par excellence Adele Wolff (Ruby Rose of ""Resident Evil: The Final Chapter""), rave DJ Harvard ""Nicks"" Zhou (Kris Wu of ""Mister Six""), and British getaway driver Tennyson Torch (Rory McCann of ""Clash of the Titans""), and they set out to retrieve Pandora's Box. Naturally, Triple-X is surprised when he confronts Xiang in the Philippines and learns that Gibbons had commissioned Xiang to purloin Pandora's Box in the first place. Cage realizes with sudden clarity that he has been duped, and he joins forces with Xiang to thwart their common enemy. Despite its formulaic shenanigans, ""xXx 3"" generates a surfeit of excitement as our heroes and villains go toe-to-toe in slam bang fashion.Apart from its smashing satellites that threaten innocent bystanders, ""xXx 3"" differs from ""xXx"" because Xander fought largely by himself in the original while he assembles an army of four to provide back-up on his latest mission. Presumably, to market ""xXx 3"" globally, the producers cast celebrity stars from other countries to charm international audiences. This stratagem succeeds, except that Donnie Yen and Tony Jaa never get a chance to surpass their exploits in previous action epics such as the ""IP Man"" trilogy and the ""Ong Bak"" trilogy. Director D.J. Caruso never lets you catch your breath and stages each action scene for maximum impact. Although little in ""xXx 3"" is remotely unusual, Caruso choreographs it with a hell-bent-for-leather velocity that never slackens. ""xXx: Return of Xander Cage"" doesn't top the original ""xXx,"" but it is no slouch where action movies are concerned.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

10,oscaralbert,"""Watch the Watchers; Fight the Enemy Within . . . """,8,23 January 2017,". . . Samuel L. Jackson, as Gibbons, urges Leader Trump as XXX: THE RETURN OF XANDER CAGE closes. There's a reason that Detroit was the ONLY city on Earth that Leader Trump mentioned as he was inaugurated last Friday. Viewers of XANDER CAGE are tipped off that the Second American Civil War must be fought and won in the World's one-time ""Motor City."" XANDER CAGE climaxes among the ""carnage"" of ""abandoned factory tombstones"" in Detroit, exactly as described in Leader Trump's speech. When he addressed America's Real Life CIA this past weekend, the news media reported that it was necessary for Leader Trump to pack the first three rows with his own private security guards, to avoid assassination by the CIA's Real Life Black Ops NSA traitors represented by Toni Collette in XANDER CAGE. But with Detroiters such as Dr. Ben Carson and Reverend Tom of Inaugural Benediction fame spearheading his charge, there's still hope that Leader Trump can follow in Vin Diesel's cinematic footsteps to win the Real Life Battle of Detroit!",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
11,FlashCallahan,X looks out for his own.....,7,2 February 2017,"Xander Cage comes out of exile, thought to be dead, and is set on a collision course with deadly Xiang and his team in a race to recover a seemingly unstoppable weapon known as Pandora's Box. Recruiting a new group of thrill-seeking eccentrics, and huge fans of The Fast And Furious franchise, Xander finds himself in a deadly conspiracy that points to collusion at the highest levels of world governments.......I'm putting this straight out there, The Return Of Xander Cage is not a good film. It's rubbish with incoherent characters and a stale plot, but my gosh, I had a lot of fun watching this, because it was just so over the top, it never had time to let the audience realise just what a pile of stupidity this is.And it's not fun because of Diesel, his titular character is one of the most obnoxious, smug, self aware characters I've ever had the displeasure to experience in film.This is why I prefer the Ice Cube sequel to the original, Darius Stone was a much more interesting character. But since Diesel thinks that the F&F movies are successful because of his return, he's tried to resurrect his other, slightly popular characters.And the box office proves that he's not the draw anymore.It's the rest of the characters that make the film so interesting. Yen and Jaa are fabulous in their respective roles, and the action never gives up. Dobrev provides the humour in the film, playing the token ditzy geek who goes weak at the knees when she speaks to Cage.But because of Diesel, the film literally turns into a fast and furious film, and while that's not a bad thing, it feels that the makers are relying on another franchise, to restart another, which is really clutching at straws.But with all that said, it's nothing more than than a really fun throwaway popcorn movie that you will forget once you've left the cinema.And Ice Cube pops up doing exactly the same as what Chuck Norris did in Expendables 2",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
12,trashgang,skip this XXX,5,27 February 2021,"It took a while before the action comes in, before all that it's all about shots of beautiful women in underwear or beachwear. A lot of blah blah and stupid macho situations. Just before bordom comes in the action comes in.Compared with the earlier entries in the franchise this isn't what it should be. Some acting is also below zero, sad to see but this for me means the end of Nina Dobrev, no acting at all.But hey, you do watch this kind of flicks for the action. Completely over the top acting not to be believed but that's what XXX is all about. Just above mediocre...

13,Hellmant,Mildly amusing.,7,3 February 2017,"​'XXX: RETURN OF XANDER CAGE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The third installment in the action movie franchise; following 2002's 'XXX' and 2005's 'XXX: STATE OF THE UNION'. Vin Diesel (who did not appear in the 2005 sequel) reprises the title role; despite the fact that the character was said to have died (in between the first two films). In this chapter, the extreme athlete (turned government agent) comes out of hiding; in order to recover a weapon for the CIA, which can control military satellites. The movie costars Donnie Yen, Tony Jaa, Toni Collette, Deepika Padukone, Ruby Rose, Nina Dobrev and Kris Wu. Samuel L. Jackson and Ice Cube also both have cameos in it, reprising their roles from the other films. It was directed by D.J. Caruso, and it was written by F. Scott Frazier. The movie has received mixed reviews from critics, and it's performed moderately well at the Box Office. I found it to be mildly amusing. The CIA, lead by agent Jane Marke (Collette), goes looking for former operative Xander Cage (Diesel); who was said to have died many years ago. They find him, and try to talk him into coming back to work for them; in order to stop a deadly weapon from falling into the wrong hands. This weapon can control military satellites, and it also caused the death of agent Augustus Eugene Gibbons (Jackson), so Cage agrees to do the assignment for them. He enlists his own team, and tracks down a criminal named Xiang (Yen); who is said to have control of the weapon. The movie is kind of fun, and it's also kind of cheesy, like all Vin Diesel movies are. If you're a fan of his, I'm sure you'll enjoy it. What's cool about this one though, is that it also has Donnie Yen, Tony Jaa, Ice Cube and some pretty tough (and quite beautiful) women as well! Diesel definitely has a lot of support, and he's not a bad action hero himself. Like I said though, the film is definitely cheesy (and quite silly at times) but it's also somewhat fun.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/_SLO5GYrmps",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
14,FeastMode,xXx vs Ip Man?!?!?,3,23 July 2019,"Lmao. laughable, literally, throughout. like from beginning to end. usually when a movie is laughable, i don't start laughing until like halfway through the movie. in the beginning i am giving it a chance and giving the movie the benefit of the doubt. in this movie i was laughing in the first five minutes. this movie is so ridiculously dumb and absurd. fortunately it's very unintentionally funny. the acting is terrible, the dialogue is horrendous. so much cheesiness. and of course absolutely ridiculous action that makes no sense and no one could believe.what makes it even worse is, you have two AMAZING martial artists in Donnie Yen and Tony Jaa. but good hand-to-hand combat scenes were almost non-existent. Donnie Yen had a few cool fight scenes but Tony Jaa was completely wasted. if this movie gets credit for anything, it's that it made me laugh at how terrible it was~time passes~during quarantine i decided to rewatch xXx, which i loved when i watched it in theaters. i assumed it would be terrible but at the very least i could laugh at some ridiculousness. i ended up really enjoying it. i definitely acknowledge how absurd it was, but for what it was trying to do, it was enjoyable in a guilty pleasure kind of way.so, again during quarantine, i decided to rewatch this movie that i gave a 1 star. i thought maybe i took it too seriously and that i should have revisited xXx before this one. maybe then i would have gone in with the proper expectations. and... at the very least i could laugh.i laughed. a lot. it's so much worse than xXx. i ask myself, why was the absurdity acceptable in the original but not in the new one? i'm not really sure. it's possible this one is just way more absurd.it also seems like they just threw the rule book out of the window for this one. in the original, they tried making something good, but made something absurd. in this one, they knew they wanted to be absurd and intentionally made it absurd. maybe that's why it doesn't work.analogy: the room is the worst movie of all time, but is only amazingly funny because it was trying to be good. if someone purposely tried to make a movie as incompetent as the room, i doubt it would be nearly as enjoyable.the other thing i noticed when rewatching is that there are some redeeming qualities here. i think the reason i gave it 1/10 the first time was that the sheer magnitude of the stupidity overrode any redeeming qualities. but going in with high absurdity expectations the second time, i was able to enjoy a few things.i LOVE that Donnie Yen is in this. I just so happen to be rewatching the Ip Man movies, he's SO BEASTLY. his moves are so fast and fluid, it mesmerizes me. he had some creative action moments, i just wish he was in it more.the other parts i enjoyed were the shamelessly cool action moments. for the parts where you can manage to ignore the absurdity, there are some legit wow moments. there was even a moment where i was laughing at how stupidly contrived it was, and then immediately thought, ""but it's kinda awesome, not gonna lie""hilariocity scale 8/10. on top of that there are things i actually liked. if you somehow combine those, it's very possible i watch this again rofl.

15,ThomasDrufke,"Rock, Paper, Scissors, Grenade Launcher",1,22 January 2017,"January has always felt like the perfect time to release some guilty pleasure action flicks. Most of the Oscar-bait films have been released, and we're set for a new year with new thrills. Unfortunately, xXx: Return of Xander Cage isn't a mindlessly fun January adventure. It's not a film that should be released in any month, ever.I've always been a big fan of Vin Diesel. His charisma is usually enough to overcome the bad movies that surround him. Plus, he seems like a great guy outside of acting so it's difficult not to root for him. But even knowing that, and being the massive Fast & Furious fan that I am, didn't do anything to help the steaming pile of crap that this movie is. As I say with most movies I give a negative review, I won't waste my time venting, and instead use my energy towards something more productive. I'll keep it short and concise.Because some will make the direct comparison, there's a big difference between this film and any of the last few F&F films. Sure, Diesel essentially plays the same character, but the execution is entirely different. The F&F franchise has been clear from the beginning, they are about family that stick together through anything. So for every ridiculous action scene in that, we have a characters that we truly care about. There is not a single character in xXx, Xander included, that I cared for. We get introduced to a tech savant played by The Hound from Game of Thrones, another techie (why?) played extremely goofily by Nina Dobrev, a sniper played by Rudy Rose, a spec op played by former NFL player Tony Gonzalez, a DJ played by Kris Wu (wait what?) former xXx agent Darius Stone played by Ice Cube and entering the film to a song by, yep you guessed it, Ice Cube. And yes, it is as painfully ridiculous as it seems.Look, I really enjoy the original xXx. It didn't take itself too seriously but it also never tried to do too much. It was simple in its execution even amidst all of the insane extreme sports stunts. This film is sloppily written, directed, and edited which makes for a waste of time at the theater. I review films based on what they set out to do. A horror film intends to scare, perhaps a biopic intends to inform, and an action film intends to entertain. Sometimes genres can transcend into others, but xXx does nothing but tick me off. And that's coming from someone who had little expectations. Why the world needed a movie about Xander and his idiotic crew of misfits trying to take down something called ""Pandora's Box""? No.-Where's the fun?-Putrid dialogue-How are these characters useful to the plot at all?-Utterly predictable1.7/10",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
16,A_Different_Drummer,Lots of Plusses and Minuses,7,21 February 2017,"Sometimes an hour and 40 minutes of non-stop action is not as much fun as it sounds like. On the other hand, films are supposed to entertain and there is more entertainment here than meets the eye.This reviewer's scorecard, humbly submitted: CONS: * Toni Collette completes her mission to distance herself as far as humanly possible from Muriels Wedding 1994. Wish she hadn't even tried.* I thought these sort of goofy semi-spoof spy films (where even the writers are not 100% sure whether to play it straight or for laughs) ended with OUR MAN FLINT in 1966. Oops. I was wrong.* writing, editing, directing all could have been turned up a notch. Looks like a big rush to get it out there so it could start spinning off cash.PROS: * Sam Jackson, an actor who film historians of the future will designate the ""most overexposed"" actor of our generation, gets only a walkon and then is blown up. Finally someone got the memo! * stars Vin Diesel, one of the most reliable action figures of our era. This is not in the class of Riddick or Pitch Black, but Vin commits to every role and does not hold back.* some really nice stunts. You will think of them fondly when you leave the theatre.* introduces Canadian Nina Dobrev to a wider audience. The line to join the fan club starts at the back of the room. And when membership closes, we can start a brand new one for Deepika Padukone.* any movie -- repeat, ANY -- that advances Donnie Yen's English language career is a plus. And worthy of our support. (Donnie's English is way better than Jet Li's was, and I wish him many more western roles.) * the final action sequence, the climax, runs about 20 minutes and is sort of engaging.BOTTOM LINE: Not as bad as the reviews suggest.

Jackson) is killed and a device capable of downing satellites disappears.Although he's under CIA supervision (Toni Collette), Xander is permitted to assemble his own team of thrill-seeking operatives (Nina Dobrev, Ruby Rose, Rory McCann) to take down the foreign parties (Donnie Yen, Tony Jaa) in possession of Pandora's Box before they unleash its powers.While the martial arts segments of this sequel's numerous action sequences are engaging, the sloppy green screen work, the script's atrocious dialogue and the barrage of absurd scenarios makes Vin's return to the character a highly disappointing one. Incidentally, extreme sports spies take their Martinis with Mountain Dew in them. Red Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
18,Reno-Rangan,A new franchise is on making!,5,24 August 2017,"I was very happy when I heard about a sequel is on the development of Vin Diesel's one of the career early films. I was a teenager, and I remember celebrating it in the theatre with my friends. But, like the T2, it was too late for a sequel. Most of other franchises are going for spin-offs in the similar case. Anyway, it was good to see the original character back in the action. Although not liked changing the title logo. The original is evergreen.Well, the story continued as the same gap between the first and this film. I thought the original concept was like solo action hero kind, but in here, it became a multi-starrer. Like most of the similar themed action film series, it tried to add variety of characters, including clichés like computer hackers and a boss to handle those rogue guys. But there were too many Triple Xes.The story was okay. It only wanted to make a comeback, like a re- introduction of everything. I liked the diversity in the film characters. The casting was from around the world, picking the best team like Donnie Yen from HK, Tony Jaa from Thailand. But I did not understand why Donnie was speaking in Mandarin, instead of Cantonese.From all I did not like Deepika. Yes, she's the real Indian beauty, but not a good actor, especially for actions, she's unsuitable. I would have preferred Priyanka in here. They two should have switched the films between this and 'Baywatch'. Jaa, I did think he had in him his witty character display. He was a completely different person in this. The rest of the guys were too not bad at all, particularly that stunt guy was awesome.When it comes to the action sequences, not some, many were totally impossible. Surely not the really performed stunts they were. Simply a special effects, and it was too much to take on. Because they were not realistically appealing to accept. Those include, non-snow mountain skiing, ocean wave bike surfing, you add it. The good news is, it was okay for watching once, but I'm anticipating the next part to be a game changer in the franchise.5/10",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
19,cruise01,An awesome action film with plenty of eye candy but cheesy!!!,8,19 January 2017,"Xander Cage is back and better than ever in the third installment to xXx. xXx: Return of Xander Cage is an all popcorn fun action film that the audience by now should not expect any more from it. xXx sole purpose is to entertain with its pumping cgi filled action, with plenty of eye candy, and have a decent plot to give reasoning for the characters to chase and fight each other in every sequence. A simple plot that follows a gang of villains led by Xiang (Donnie Yen), Serena (Deepika Padukone), and two others that steal a device ""Pandora Box."" They steal the device from the CIA Jane (Toni Collette). Which the device can control the satellites and cause destruction. Jane recruits the exile extreme athlete Xander Cage (Vin Diesel) to become like them and to retrieve Pandora box. Cage will need the help of his own people from Nicks (Kris Wu), Adele (Ruby Rose), and Tennyson (Rory McCann) to travel to the Philippines and to save the world from further destruction. xXx is a brainless action film that can get ridiculous from messing with the laws of physics during a fight scene in a military plane. But the film does well in delivering the big loud action sequences. Sure, the filmmakers are not focused on a strong story or character development. As long as the action can top the previous scene and get insane and entertaining. There is plenty of exciting action sequences from an intense motorcycle chase that takes place riding above the water and into the waves. Or the fight sequence with Vin and Donnie running on top of moving semi's and into a high-speed traffic. Or the zero gravity of a military plane falling was insane. The visual effects were decent though.Vin Diesel is awesome as Xander Cage and sure, the eye candy newcomers like Deepika Padukone, Ruby Rose, and the geeky Nina Dobrev are all stunning and made their characters fun. Donnie Yen was also a fierce fighter, and let his fighting skills do most of his acting. Samuel L. Jackson makes his appearance as Gibson again. It is not going to be the top notch acting, but these actors worked well as action stars. The audience cannot expect any more than that. It is a movie with fun action set pieces, eye candy, and some cheesy humor. The script is not going to be the best writing. Containing some cheesy dialogue and one-liners. Which it could have worked without or have better humor. The close to action alone makes the film worth the price of admission. I feel like the first movie was superior cause it had more of a serious approach. The third film tried to have more characters that tried working as a team. Every one of the casts does have their moment to shine when it came to the action. I recommend xXx if you enjoyed the previous films or wanting to see an adrenaline pumping action movie that does not take itself seriously.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
20,TheMovieDiorama,"xXx: The Return Of Xander Cage might be mind numbing entertainment, but that doesn't make it a good film.",4,26 February 2018,"The original xXx is a good time. Vin Diesel, Russian parties (or Belarusian...I forgot) and the pounding soundtrack of Rammstein. It's just fun. Over a decade later, we have a sequel (discounting the Ice Cube abomination). Why? I don't know. Yet here we are. Xander Cage is recruited to obtain 'Pandora's Box', a device that seemingly brings down satellites and make them act like missiles. Cage recruits fellow multicultural (because that's important, obviously) xXx members to save the world. Generic technological spy plot blah blah blah, you didn't watch xXx for the plot. You watched it for the adrenaline fuelled stunts, the sheer crazy feats that Cage achieves. Unsurprisingly, this fell flat. Riding a motorbike on water? Sure. Jumping and flipping over moving traffic? Why not. Skiing down a jungle mountain? Wait what!? Props for the stupid stunts, they did indeed put a smile on my face. The inclusion of Donnie Yen doing his own stunts and owning every fight scene was perfect. The light sarcastic witty tone bursting throughout the script was fun. But that is all this film is...fun. Leave your brain behind and just watch the mindless action unfold. Even so, there are way too many issues here. Generic boring plot aside, Vin Diesel clearly loves himself too much that he constantly surrounds himself with beautiful women and relishes the chance for topless scenes. Extremely over indulgent, he is an action star unfortunately. The supporting cast, apart from Yen, were wasted. Toni Collette was a weird choice and Ruby Rose was underused. The visual effects were horrendously noticeable. Vin Diesel's stunt double was far too obvious, especially in fights with Yen. Caruso's direction was mediocre at best. Substituting Rammstein for electro pop music is the worst crime. Who doesn't love Rammstein!? The original was more memorable in my eyes, so I have to downgrade this. Fun but far too mediocre.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

22,SAMTHEBESTEST,A Typical Money Making Entertainer with Full dose of Action Stunts,6,18 January 2017,"xXx Return Of Xander Cage Review : Finished watching xXx in Hindi dubbed version so my review will be friendly to Indian audience may be. I have not seen previous films of this franchise so my might won't help you but that would a plus point because my views about film will be individual and fresh. xXx Return Of Xander Cage is a typical Action drama film, which entertains you but does not impress if you are looking for something different or new. Script has nothing new to offer so obviously Kick ass Action scenes, Stunts and Dialogues saves the film from being not a Crap. So many Twists and Surprises are there in the 2nd half which are predictable. Acting field had no potential so just forget about it, but want to mention Deepika here cause she has good enough screenspace in film which actually made me feel proud as an Indian. Cinematography is Breathtaking, Visual Effects are Awesome, except couple of scenes which looks animated. Action stunts are something for which you can tolerate this film. Screenplay is good, not boring at all. Direction is pretty Good, nothing impressive but less minuses helps it. Overall it is a Typical Action Drama Money Making and Box Office Friendly Entertainer which has appeal for limited i mean Mass audience. There is nothing bad in watching it at least once, after that you can decide yourself that you want to give it a repeat watch or not (I can't give it a Repeat Watch). I'm giving 6/10* to this Action Drama flick as i think with this script a better movie can't be made.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
23,arfdawg-1,A Silly Meaningless Stunt Movie,2,23 January 2017,"The Plot.Extreme athlete turned government operative Xander Cage (Vin Diesel) comes out of self-imposed exile, thought to be long dead, and is set on a collision course with deadly alpha warrior Xiang (Donnie Yen) and his team in a race to recover a sinister and seemingly unstoppable weapon known as Pandora's Box. Recruiting an all-new group of thrill-seeking cohorts, Xander finds himself enmeshed in a deadly conspiracy that points to collusion at the highest levels of world governments.Another reviewer said there was no action. He obviously was too high to remember what movie he saw because this movie is ALL action.And that's the problem. It's just a stunt movie with no real plot.One action scene after the next filled with silly orchestrated stunts that could never be pulled off in the real world.I was bored beyond belief.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
24,subxerogravity,Cute!,6,21 January 2017,"It's fair to say it was the best XXX, not that that really matters.How could it not be the best XXX? It's a big movie. Vin Diesel leads a team of heavy hitters. I mean, Donne Yen and Tony Jaa are in this MoFo! Sure, they're missed used.( They did a better job using Jaa in Furious 7, which once again is not saying much), but any die-hard marshal arts fan is going to get goose bumps seeing Yen and Jaa in the same room together. Although it's worth mentioning that watching Donne Yeh do his thing even at level one like he does in this movie only makes you have more respect for what he can do. There is a plot. Something about a box that can be use to take over the world, Yadda Yadda Yadda, somehow Xander Cage is still alive to save us all. Who cares, right!? Certainly not the filmmakers. DJ Cursio seemed only to care about Cool dudes, Hot babes and blowing crap up. I can't complain, it's the bare necessities of an action film, especially of one called XXX.I remember when I saw the first movie, a friend of mine used the word cute to describe it. Of course he met it more as an insult but I realized I like it for being cute. It was a film met for a 13 year old boy who loved his PlayStation 2, and now Vin Diesel returns in the role from the film that he starred in when he first became big (And the franchise he kinda screwed up when he got to big for his britches).Trying to make a movie that appeals to a 13 year old with a PlayStation 4, this time, Diesel uses his star power wisely to it's full potential to get a power house ensemble cast that would totally appeal to a international market and expanding the XXX franchise in hopes that another movie will get made (At least that's what it looks like). Not as sophisticated as his attempt to revive the Riddick franchise with the 2013 film, it's more of a leave your brain at home and eat your popcorn type of thing.So yeah, The Return of Xander Cage was cute. If you like the other XXX movies, even State of the Union (and yes look for you know who), then you'll love this movie, cause it's got all that. Even Sam Jackson who I would have never though Disney would allow to reprise his role as the other one eyed head of a spy organization looking for more heroics when choosing his agents. Plus it's got more. More action, more explosions, hotter girls, cooler guys, and as it moves from being an alternative to James Bond to an alternative to Mission: Impossible, it is a potentially good franchise to replace Underworld and Resident Evil in the dead mouth of January when both of those franchises retired this year.http://cinemagardens.com",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

But Xander faces his greatest challenge from a group of similarly skilled people.The original xXx was meant to be dethrone Bond, a hardcore American action hero with extreme sports skills and an anti-authority streak. Yet it was a film I hated at the time because it was such a poor attempt to outdo Bond and it is even worst because it is so dated. The aim of this broaden the franchise's appeal and making xXx more like Fast and Furious.xXx: Return of Xander Cage has an international cast, getting actors from India, China, Britain, Australia and Thailand, major markets and having stars that could appeal to action nuts.From a stunts and action level Return of Xander Cage is solid enough and the presence of Donnie Yen and Tony Jaa is always a welcome presence.xXx: Return of Xander Cage is a big improvement over the previous two xXx films but considering the standard of those flicks the only way was up.

27,stevendbeard,Adrenaline Rush,7,20 January 2017,"I saw ""XXX:The Return of Xander Cage"", starring Vin Diesel-The Fast & The Furious movies, The Pacifier; Donny Yen-Rogue One:A Star Wars Story, Shanghai Knights; Toni Collette-Krampus, Shaft_2000; Nina Dobrev-The Vampire Diaries_tv, Let's Be Cops and Samuel L. Jackson-The Legend of Tarzan, Shaft_2000.This is the third in the XXX series, the second with Vin-he wasn't in the 2005 Ice Cube debacle but he started it all in the 2002 original. I guess that's why they wanted to remind you in the title, The Return of Zander Cage. If you are unfamiliar with the premise-or just need a refresher-Samuel plays a government agent that recruits extreme sports athletes as spies-they are all called 'XXX'. I mean who would suspect them as spies, right? Anyway, this movie starts with Samuel trying to recruit a soccer player as the next XXX when something bad happens, taking Sam out of the game. Toni steps into Sam's shoes and goes looking for Vin to lure him out of retirement to help stop the latest world ending crisis. Donny leads a gang of competent thieves that get their hands on what's called Pandora's Box, a gadget that controls satellites. The bad guys use the satellites as weapons to rain down on whomever they wish, literally. Vin gets his own team of unorthodox agents to try and stop global annihilation which showcases lots of stunts, fights and chases. You know, whatever will give you that old adrenaline rush. Nina plays a tech expert that is assigned to Vin's team-she has never been in the field & she hates guns. Along the journey, you get to see other XXX agents, including the fore mentioned one from 2005. The cast includes Tony Jaa/Ong Bak, Tony Gonzales/ football player & Michael Bisping/UFC fighter as either good guys or bad guys-there were lots more that I'm sure I did not know. It's rated ""PG-13"" for gun-play, violent action, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 47 minutes. If you liked the first one-and not-so-much the second one-then you should enjoy this one. I know I did and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
28,alindsay-al,A poor action film that is pretty messy,3,20 January 2017,"I haven't seen any of the xxx films, but I thought I would give this film a chance and this film really let me down. The premise of the film sees a group of extreme criminals going after a piece of technology so the government enlists the help of xander cage and his team to stop them. Vin diesel returns to the role of xander cage and he does an okay job, the guy is in great physical condition and you buy him in the action scenes and some of his line do work. However, even though he tries his best his performance comes across as very wooden and stoic. His one liners just aren't delivered very well at all and his character is just not interesting at all. There is a large supporting cast in this film with the best being Donnie yenn and Rory McCann, Donnie yenn is becoming one of my favourite action stars in films at the moment and he was great in this film. He is great in the action scenes and his character was actually the most interesting character in this film even though that isn't saying allot. McCann plays the hound in game of thrones and he is a fun addition to the film in his role. But everyone else in this film is just a massive cartoon whether it is the romantic interest you don't care about or the athletes who are bad actors or the character of Becky who is one of the worst characters I have seen in recent time. The story of this film is incredibly cliché and dull, all the twists and turns are incredibly predictable and you will guess them within the first 20 mins of the film. Yhere is nothing really interesting in the storytelling of this film when they even try to and it just fails. The script has incredibly cheesy dialogue that just doesn't work, mainly due to the poor delivery by the actors and because of how poor the script is written. The style has some hard hitting cool action scenes but there is nothing incredibly special in the film. Also there is some weird editing decisions involved in some of the action scenes that does make it hard to watch. Overall this is a really poor action film that isn't worth a watch.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
29,Fluke_Skywalker,Check your brain at the door,5,19 June 2017,"If you were the one person who thought that the first xXx was too subtle and realistic, you're in luck! There isn't one single subtle or realistic moment in this sequel that sees Vin Diesel return to the title role in all of his mumbly, muscle shirt wearing glory. It's one of those movies where even a character peeling a banana is shown hyper-stylized and set to a bad electronica song. You can either balk at this--and I wouldn't blame you one little bit if you did--or you can dial back the 'ol brain and just roll with it. Skate with it. Whatever. I chose the latter and was mildly entertained. Upon reflection, I'm not sure the tradeoff was worth it.As I said, Diesel returns, and by the looks of things his ego has grown fatter than his wallet in the ensuing years. Every woman his character meets drools all over themselves and sing his praises like a scantily clad church choir. Watching the nearly 50 year old play the ""Extreme"" thing already stretches credibility farther than the fabric of his ill-fitting t-shirts, but seeing a sextet of 20-something hotties ravage him takes the taco. That said, Diesel is in good form here, showing an easy, mumbly charm often lacking in his more dour, mumbly Fast and Furious counterpart. Like the latter franchise, his castmates here are a veritable United Colors of Benetton, with the always welcome Donnie Yen acquitting himself the best.This movie is almost impressive in its unabashed stupidity. There are a few random moments of wit, proving that there's truth in the old axiom ""Even a blind squirrel finds a nut now and then."", but you don't watch a movie like this for wit. You watch, somewhat embarrassed to be doing so with literally thousands of other options, hoping for an undemanding and disposable bit of junk food, and for better or worse, that's what this delivers.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

It's devoid of anything that looks like a plot or decent character development. Instead its cheesy show off time with lots of tat's, juvenile bravado, sparkly overstated jewelry and guns from ""da hood"".

32,rgkarim,Xander Cage Returns To Over The Top Stunt Show,6,21 January 2017,"Lights, Camera, Action! The last statement in particular is what my next review is all about. You may remember back in the day when Vin Diesel took the spotlight as Xander Cage, the action daredevil turned secret agent to take out terrorists. The movie was about bringing extreme stunts into a spy world to create an action-packed spy thriller. Despite releasing a failing sequel about ten years ago, Hollywood still hasn't given up on this series. That's right as you can read, my review is on XXX: The Return of Xander Cage. What lies in store for this film? Robbie K is happy to answer that question with another review. So, let's get started my friends!LIKES:  Comedic at parts  Nostalgic references  Action PackedI know, comedy is not what you expect in this film, but give me a break there isn't much to this film. Xander Cage brings his wise-guy quips back into the works from insulting authority to playing verbal assault tennis with terrorists. Some of the dialogue is well timed and a great laugh to ease up the tension, which helps add some entertainment to the mix. Past the minor comedic stunts though, this third installment has plenty of nostalgia to bring you longtime fans back into the series. Whether it's a simple line or a very familiar stunt, Xander Cage's latest adventure will more than fill you in on everything leading up to this point, while providing more laughs. However, the biggest selling point of the move (to no surprise) is the action of the film. This film is all about the flashy bangs, choreographed fights, and over the top stunts that will rock any action junkie's world. Much of these stunts are physics defying sequences that we fantasize about, but it doesn't make the flashiness any less impressive. Xander and his team will bring a little bit of everything into the mix, which is sure to entertain many who love Diesel's franchises. DISLIKES:  Predictable story/Dropped the Spy aspect  Pressured Comedy  Didn't utilize the team aspect as much  Action crosses over into cheesinessNo surprise, the story of Xander Cage has not gotten any deeper. The movie's plot is very thin to say the least, and despite trying to add a few twists to the mix, there is very little one can't see coming. As an added (disappointing) bonus, the directors' decision to substitute plot for action resulted in the spy aspect crashing like one of the stunt cars. If you liked the intelligence gathering of the first movie, sorry, but that ship has sailed for poorly constructed villains and an equally cheesy plan. Another let down pertaining to the plot, is how little the other characters were utilized. Oh sure, there are a few of the elite team that get there moment in the sun (characters played by Donnie Yen, Deepika Padukone, and Ruby Rose), but the other ""elite"" warriors were reduced to very shallow roles of idiotic flipping, random stunt show offs, and forced comedy. The latter in particular was hard to stomach, as the writers got a little zealous in trying to get a laugh that is become more annoying than entertaining. Finally, despite the action being awesome at many points, it is also very unrealistic at the same time. Remember those incredibly cheesy stunts in Furious 7? XXX amplifies that factor times ten, with mediocre animation and stunts that will make you roll your eyes. But hey it still has the excitement you could be craving. The Verdict:Bottom line, XXX: Return of Xander Cage is a simplistic, unbalanced, high-adrenaline movie that will provide a good laugh and some thrills. It is a shame they scrapped the spy aspect and essentially grated the story, but hey it gives you that action packed punch we've been craving. So therefore, if you can swallow the ridiculous, sometimes ill-timed, stunt sequences, corny jokes, and forced action, then check this movie out for the theater worthy special effects. However, in all reality, this review suggests skipping this film and catching something else instead. My scores: Action/Adventure/Thriller: 6.0 Movie Overall: 5.0",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

34,Rob_Taylor,The Return of Xander Cringe...,5,17 August 2017,"So, there are many and varied problems with this movie. Firstly, it doesn't know if it should take itself seriously, or just ham everything up. The result of this indecision is a movie that can sometimes be funny, but at others just cringe-inducingly bad.Vin Diesel seems to have a love-affair with movies that horny teenage boys will like and, honestly, it is becoming increasingly embarrassing to watch. We all remember the ""action heroes"" of 80's movies that just refuse to acknowledge they can't cut it anymore and continue to pump out straight-to-video crap. Diesel isn't there yet and won't be for a long time, but it isn't hard to imagine him one day falling into the same trap as the likes of Steven Seagal.The Return of Xander Cage (TRoXC) is a movie that would feel right at home alongside the movies such as Half Past Dead and Out for a Kill. It's trivial, it's dumb and very clearly aimed at audiences for whom quality is not a consideration. The movie exists entirely to showcase its star and little else.The characterisations are bad, the acting is definitely non-Kosher, and the action beyond ludicrous at times. It is not even enough to simply switch your brain off for this one. You have to have it surgically removed if you want to get anything out of this movie.No, really! Because without a brain, you can totally believe that a motorcycle will continue to run under water and behave just like a jetski. With a brain, it just looks like what it is...stupid.In conclusion, I hate movies that are aggressively dumb and this makes even Diesel's later Fast and Furious outings look smart by comparison.SUMMARY: Dumber than a bag of hammers. Cringe-inducing acting and dialogue. A Vin Diesel vehicle that crashed and burned in the worst possible way. Well worth avoiding!",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
35,eric262003,Too Cartoon-Like and Very Much Lacking in Logic,5,26 January 2020,"In 2002, after the success of 2001's ""The Fast and the Furious"", Hollywood found it's new successor in the action film genre with Vin Diesel taking charge. He would star in what had potential to be the future franchise that will take off as Diesel would star as Xander Cage in ""xXx"". It had everything what you would expect in an action film, muscle, ammunition, explosives, some humour, cool bad guys, gadgets and whatnot. Sure it didn't reach the same level as ""The Fast and the Furious"", but it had hope to get better if they launched a second installment. Cut to 2005 and all our wishes were thrown out the window. Diesel demanded a salary raise and when his request was rebuffed, he left the the project and ""xXx: State of the Union"" recast rapper/actor Ice Cube to take the lead as Darrius Stone. The following sequel failed to reach $70 million and the franchise was killed before it ever got off the ground. In 2017, Diesel decides to reprise his character and the third part gets the green light and very little had changed since the first installment was launched. ""xXx: Return of Xander Cage"" and you have the feeling like you've revisited 2002 at a time when atmospheric adrenaline fueled movies like this were the fad with the same direction you can see when watching Jack Bauer or James Bond, the stuff that adolescent boys go crazy for. The level of excitement can be a bit illogical at times that it's hard to take this as a serious film though the characters take the roles given to them very seriously. Though far from a masterpiece, it has material to pass off as a guilty pleasure.After Diesel's departure from the franchise, there were fragments of possibilities that his character was killed somewhere near the first and second installments. By the time you get to this third installment, it is reveal that he has faked his death and had been living in the Dominican Republic. When news about the murder of his mentor Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson who still thinks he's playing Nick Fury), Xander is back and ready for action. Led by CIA operative Jane Marke (Toni Collette trying to put on her tough face) he is given the initiative to locate the villains who have possession of the ultra-destructive Pandora's Box which has the manipulative ability to weaponize satellites. Led by the deadly Xiang (Donnie Yen) and the attractive Serena (Deepika Padukone) in which these actors are their to promote inclusiveness to the Asian demographics, but to also be fearsome adversaries to Cage only later we reveal that they were working for Gibbons. So is Gibbons an alliance or an enemy? I just don't understand.There are two subplots in this third franchise one being the the group that's working with Xander (Ruby Rose, Kris Wu and Rory McCann) and the second is when the action gets in gear as Xander goes globe trotting first in the Philippines and then to Detroit to look for the whereabouts of Pandora's Box and the evil mastermind whose behind it. Under the direction of DJ Caruso, he must have took notes from ""The Fast and the Furious"" franchise as each scenes are long, exciting and defies any logic whatsoever. What Caruso and many other action directors fail to offer is a hero that doesn't inflict pain. How are we supposed to get invested in characters who can get away with the things they put up with and walk without a injury? It makes us care less about them because it feels like they might as well be cartoons who often get up from pain and return unharmed. Sure we can argue and say Bond never dies, but he is vulnerable and we can cheer him on when he escapes his predicaments. The action sequences were so outrageous the logistics are an insult to those who are into the laws of physics.There were many times when viewing this movie that the nautical nonsense must've been a parody to action films sue to the unintentionally funny scenes. It it was advertised as a comedy then I'd be fine with that. But it doesn't say it's a comedy and the performers act like it's serious through their frame of minds that makes it off-putting. Sure there might be the odd funny scene, but the atmosphere through the eyes of Caruso and the ensemble makes us want to believe that we are watching a serious action film. The final scenes that let up fail because we can never take a moment that this was intended to be serious.It's hard for me to trash on this movie too much as like junk food, it's really eaten for the sake of a guilty pleasure. In the end it's just another string of action films that deliver thrills without much of a story going for it. And sure it is a mindless flick it is never boring and the noise will likely keep you awake for years. And yeah, Diesel takes most of the screen, but he's outdone by the performances by Donnie Yen who stole the show and surely if they get a forth installment, Ice Cube and Vin Diesel will likely partner up more likely for approval in the Asian film market. But viewing this movie, I think Xander was better off staying out of the limelight.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

37,vengeance20,Surprisingly good!,9,1 February 2017,"Having not seen xXx (2002) & xXx: State Of Union (2005), I found myself watching a late night showing of this film last night, only shortly before discovering it was a 3rd film in a series spanning since 2002! So 12 years on, we get xXx: The Return Of Xander Cage!I never knew too much about the franchise, but it's an action film at the end of the day! So I was happy to watch it as I love those types of films & it looked interesting on the adverts on TV.The film is about the return of Xander Cage as an agent! Like the previous films, it features action sequences, guns/knives & kick arse fighting, though this is a 12, it wasn't a bad film considering its age rating!The action sequences were epic, along with the story-line, which in turn was a little confusing but not too confusing enough that I understood it in the end! The end part with the Military Plane Kami Kazi-ing into the satellite was one of my favourite scenes! The women in this film were gorgeous as hell!! That scene with Hermione Corfield coming out of the pool in her bikini was something else...! She's a honey!! Becky in this film was cute too...!But the film was overall really good! Surprising considering its content & violence which I usually prefer at a higher standard!Overall a 9/10 rating from me!",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
38,bkrauser-81-311064,xXx: DOA,4,19 January 2017,"""Kick some a**, get the girl, and try to look dope while you do it."" – These are the words uttered by Samuel L. Jackson's Augustus Gibbons, and they pretty much service as a yard stick for this franchise's auspicious return. The first xXx (2002), for all its overzealous bluster still managed a surprising amount of memorable moments. The stunts begin with our hero Xander Cage (Diesel) parachuting off a car while going over a bridge, and from there the movie simply doesn't let up. So what kind of hyper-styled, gun toting, car flipping, xtreme sporting, PG-13 rebelliousness does this new movie have.Apparently not a lot, come to find out. The Return of Xander Cage for all its first act sizzle and a slew of new, conveniently internationally renowned cast members does little to nothing in the way of providing passable thrills. It instead retreads old ground with a sandbox of ever changing loyalties, perfunctory exposition dumps and sloppily edited action scenes. If the first movie was the pinnacle, this movie is the xXx franchise's totaled remains at the bottom of a creek.The film begins with the sudden death of Gibbons via rogue satellite which sets up a search for the films technical macguffin. Ironically enough xXx: State of the Union (2005) begins with the off-screen death of Xander Cage but, you know, death means nothing in films like these. New NSA program head (Collette) then re-recruits Xander and tasks him with locating the technical macguffin, which has been taken by a task force of equally daring criminals. After some cajoling, Xander decides to help the NSA this one last time but only if he works with his own ensemble of daring misfits.I was willing to meet this movie halfway, I really was. And for the first fifteen minutes, The Return of Xander Cage was poised to deliver all the goofball bravado of an early 2000's Sprite commercial set to the vibrations of Toni Collette's furrowed eyebrows, Nina Dobrev's frenzied fangirl-dom and Diesel's obnoxious fur coat. All the movie needed to do at that point was give the audience some unique action set-pieces and try not take its plot too seriously.Unfortunately the movie makes both mistakes. It inundates the audience with rather tame acrobatics and mindless gun violence, neither of which crackle with the excitement needed nor leaves us with any kind of impression. The action sequences are then chopped up and tucked under long, padded moments of supposedly clever dialogue that only highlight Vin Diesel's holier-than-thou smugness. It's all pretty repetitive too – Diesel is cornered by baddies sporting guns, he says something he thinks is clever, no one has the horse sense to shoot the son-of-a-b***h and he somehow gets the upper hand.As for the plot, the movie goes through great lengths to justify late film allegiance shifts by tethering our heroes and villains to the same middle school understanding of populism that defined the first movie. Once this happens however the movie nose dives into conspiracy theories and hackneyed political messaging which it has absolutely no interest in following through on. While I'm all in favor of raging against the machine, I really don't think the best conduit for such material is a movie sponsored by Timberland and Thom Browne sunglasses. Especially when our supposed hero thinks being a rebel means scooting around on a skateboard, stealing cable and bedding every woman who asks him about his tattoos.All that and all this movie had to do from the get-go was ""kick a**, get the girl and try to look dope while doing it."" Spoiler alert: Cage doesn't get the girl (though he does get his GTO back). He does kick a reasonable amount of a**, sure but considering this movie has Donnie Yen and Tony Jaa in it, there should have been a lot more bodies on the floor. As for looking dope, xXx: The Return of Xander Cage is disappointingly humdrum. There's nothing too unique about the action except maybe for a climactic zero-G fistfight which probably has a record for longest plane nosedive in movie history. Besides that, if you want to get your money's worth of death defying stunts, go watch The Fast and the Furious (2001-Present) series instead.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
39,moviexclusive,"Over-the-top action, unapologetically cheesy dialogue and a barely serviceable story, this reboot of 'xXx' is comfort food for action movie junkies",6,19 January 2017,"No one had asked for a sequel to 'xXx: State of the Union', but given the phenomenal success in rebooting the 'Fast and Furious' series, this modest Vin Diesel franchise has been dusted off the shelves for a third instalment. If you don't already know, the somewhat dubious-sounding title is really the name of a National Security Agency's covert-spy programme run by one burn-scarred Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson), whose maiden recruit was the thrill-seeking extreme sports enthusiast Xander Cage and counts among its legacy ex-con Darius Stone (Ice Cube). As Augustus would have you and Brazilian pro-footballer Neymar know in his wry tongue- in-cheek opening, the 'Triple X' programme has been very much alive in the decade since Ice Cube's Stone took over Vin Diesel's Cage for the underwhelming follow-up back in 2005.Before Santos manages to tell Augustus if he wants into 'Triple X', a satellite from space comes crashing down on them, brought down by a device known as 'Pandora's Box' that can be used to turn satellites into missiles. Ah, what perfect excuse to lure Xander back from self-imposed exile in the Dominican Republic, which forms the backdrop for an over-the-top introduction that sees him ski down a tall broadcasting tower and skateboard his way through bendy mountain roads with a transformer in order to give the humble local folks free football coverage. The obligatory Government suit here is Toni Collette's humorless Jane Marke, who tracks him down and hands him an assignment to track down a team of four equally adrenaline- pumped (and therefore deemed highly dangerous) terrorists who have stolen the aforementioned device from right under her nose at the CIA's New York City office.Given that it is Donnie Yen's Xiang who breaks into the said security by leaping off an adjacent building and through the facility's glass roof, 'xXx: Return of Xander Cage' teases a potential showdown between Vin Diesel and series newcomer Donnie Yen – which we'd be honest was as exciting as waiting for the one-on-one between Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson in 'Fast and Furious 5'. Yet, for the benefit of those harbouring similar expectations, that promise is never quite fulfilled, not least because of a mid-act twist by writer F. Scott Franzier that effectively takes the sting out of their supposed rivalry. Without spoiling anything, let's just say that neither Cage's other team members – sharpshooter Adele Wolff (Ruby Rose), professional 'demolition' driver Tennyson (Rory McCann), IT expert and deejay Nicks Zhou (Kris Wu) – nor Xiang's – Serena Unger (Deepika Padukone), Hawk (Michael Bisping) and Talon (Tony Jaa) – end up being memorably at odds with one another.Oh yes, if you haven't already guessed, this instalment is really a thinly disguised reboot of the franchise as an ensemble – and so much like how Diesel's Dominic Toretto was the de-facto leader of the team in the more recent 'Fast and Furious' additions, his Xander Cage assumes a similar role rallying his 'Triple X' cohorts together against a bunch of hawkish insurgents within the US Government who want the device as their own 'nuclear football'. If their rapport isn't quite as infectious, it is partly because the supporting cast isn't quite as charismatic in their own right as that in 'Fast and Furious' (there's no one here that even comes close to the sheer comic relief of Tyrese Gibson and Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges) and partly because there is hardly enough narrative space for each side character to define his or her own personality. As it is, most of the attention is spent developing the pseudo tension between Cage and Xiang and the genuine sexual tension between Cage and Serena.Not that each does not offer up its own unique pleasures – especially during the final act, Diesel and Yen have great rapport between them, which to fans of the latter (us included) is reassurance that he is not simply some token big-name Asian inclusion; in fact, it is Yen's lightning-quick gongfu moves (marred by some hyperactive editing) that steals the spotlight from Diesel's showy but ultimately unrealistic daredevil stunts. Padukone's fans too can rest easy; not only is the actress never asked to justify for speaking in her native English accent, she pretty much holds her own next to Diesel when it comes to butt-kicking. On the other hand, Jaa is lost amidst the noise and fury, and even more so than in 'Furious 7' gets a thankless bit role with his hair dyed blond and little more than a cheeky demeanor to show for. It should also be said that Ice Cube's cameo is milked for as much as it is worth, showing up at a critical moment that will surely have you cheering.And indeed, there is no reason you should expect 'xXx: Return of Xander Cage' to be any more than big, loud and dumb fun – nor for that matter does it have any ambition to be anything else but. The stunts are intentionally ridiculous – who knew motorbikes could transform into jet skis on water and survive after being completely submerged – and excessive, conceived and performed with an utter disregard for physics or simple commonsense logic. The lines are unapologetically cheesy – 'I'm XXX,' says Cage when asked if he is a rebel or a tyrant – and with every pun intended – 'Under cover,' Cage answers when asked to describe his method of bedding a posse of women to uncover the identities of Xiang and his crew. Last but not least, the story is unashamedly shallow and derivative. Yet insofar as being fast food for the action movie crowd, this is as Gibbons describes – 'kicks some ass, gets the girls, and looks dope while doing it'.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
40,Takethispunch,Good action sequences,10,19 March 2017,"NSA Agent Augustus Gibbons attempts to recruit footballer Neymar Jr. for the xXx program when a satellite crashes in Brazil, apparently killing them both. Shortly afterwards, a team of four skilled individuals led by Xiang infiltrates the highly guarded CIA headquarters in order to retrieve ""Pandora's Box"", a device which is capable of controlling satellites to crash at specific locations as warheads. CIA Agent Jane Marke tracks down former xXx operative Xander Cage, who faked his death and has been living in self-imposed exile in the Dominican Republic, and convinces him to return to active service to retrieve the device. After enlisting an old friend, Ainsley, for help, Cage tracks down the attackers to the Philippines. A unit of Special Forces operatives led by Paul Donovan is assigned to help Xander, but he rejects them in favour of his own team, composed of sharpshooter Adele Wolff, DJ Harvard ""Nicks"" Zhou, and getaway driver Tennyson ""The Torch."" They are also aided by introverted weapons specialist Becky Clearidge. The team locates Xiang and his teammates Serena, Talon and Hawk, and Cage meets Xiang in an underground nightclub on a remote island, where Xiang reveals that his team are all part of the xXx program, recruited by Gibbons. He claims to have stolen Pandora's Box to prevent its misuse, although Serena believes they should destroy it. Shortly after, Russian soldiers raid the island. The group manages to fend off the attackers, while Xiang manages to escape with Pandora's Box. Xander intercepts Xiang and chases him to a nearby beach. Serena betrays him, destroys the Box and joins Xander's team, while Xiang escapes and regroups with Talon & Hawk. After another satellite crash in Russia, Marke determines that the device that Serena destroyed was only a prototype, and that both teams have been wasting time, while Cage determines that CIA Director Anderson is involved in the conspiracy and that the actual Pandora's Box is in his hands. Cage's and Xiang's teams race to reach Anderson first in Detroit, tracking the unique signal of Pandora's Box, with Xander and Xiang fighting and later protecting each other from Anderson's men. Xander confronts Anderson, who admits to causing the satellite crash that killed Gibbons. Anderson is then shot dead by Wolff. The CIA arrests Xiang in an attempt to frame him for the attack in Russia, and secures the box. En route back to headquarters, Marke announces that the xXx Program has been shut down and shoots Xander in order to keep it for herself. She then sends a group of assassins to eliminate the others, who are awaiting extraction at a local NSA warehouse. They join forces to fend off their attackers and receive assistance from another former xXx operative, Darius Stone.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
41,Abdulxoxo,Mindless fun,6,27 February 2021,"There isn't a particularly deep and meaningful plot; but to be honest it doesn't really matter. Basically there's an electronic devise that can control satellites. With this devise (which they very unoriginally call Pandora's Box) they can make satellites into weapons that fall out of the sky crashing down into Earth. The bad guys have Pandora's Box, and the good guys try to get it back into safe hands. Simple as that.It had an awesome fighting. Donnie Yen and Tony Jaa were fantastic as expected. There were stunts galore (including a choreographed freeway scene). The women were hot. Rose & Padukone were bad-ass. There were nods to other great action movies as well. It also has an amazing soundtrack that kept the energy level up the whole time. It was just a thrill ride that kept me thoroughly entertained from start to finish.However, It has many problems. A lot of the CGI is poor. Some of the lines are really cheesy. There are stunts and sequences that went too far or were physically impossible. The plot is ridiculous. People don't seem to get hurt as much as they obviously should, despite falls from large heights or car crashes, etc. You could go on with this, So if anyone says this movie is rubbish it's difficult to argue with that perspective.On the whole, this is clearly not any kind of technical masterpiece. It's certainly isn't award-worthy or garner critical acclaim. What this movie was, was unbelievably fun and entertaining.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

43,Troy_Campbell,The guiltiest of guilty pleasures.,7,20 January 2017,"The trailer for this threequel promised dumb fun, but in reality the phrase 'dumb fun' barely covers the sort of bombastic action entertainment this extreme sports-themed flick delivers. The Fast and Furious franchise appears steeped in rock-solid physics by comparison. Yet there's a heavy tongue-in-cheek tone that ensures the utter ridiculousness of it all is playful and enjoyable, rather than eye-rolling and pretentious, á la the recent Point Break remake. The light-heartedness goes so far as to include cheeky cameos, colourful character intro screens and a few meta-jokes about The Avengers, which, along with the amount of fun the entire cast seem to be having, gives licence to the sheer insanity of the set pieces. There's a grenade party game, skateboarding on the side of a bus, sniping whilst hanging from a tree, fighting in a free-falling military transport plane, jumping over moving cars on a highway, and motorbike skiing at the beach. And that's only a tiny glimpse of what's on display. Headlining the titular comeback, Vin Diesel is clearly having a blast in hero-with-an-attitude mode—think Dominic Toretto but without the solemn family-first moral code—whilst his multicultural co-stars do their best to ham it up in the best way possible. Bollywood star Deepika Padukone is full-on femme fatale, martial arts legend Donnie Yen is a laidback arse-kicker, Aussie Ruby Rose oozes next-gen sexuality, acting vet Toni Collette snarls with glee, Nina Dobrev gives good perky nerd, and Samuel L. Jackson does, well, Samuel L. Jackson.

46,phubbs,xXx: Return of Xander Cage,1,25 May 2017,"Some people have been wanting to see a different angle on James Bond, perhaps diversifying the main role, well look no further. Yes I realise its a bit old hat to label this franchise as a mere Bond clone, but hell...in this movie they even go as far as to clone a classic Bond moment. That moment being the immortal sequence where Ursula Andress strides out of the sea in her white bikini. Said sequence was then cloned (or paid homage to) by Craig Daniels in 'Casino Royale', and now we have Vin Diesel doing the exact same thing in this movie.So what's this movie all about? Well not a lot really, and that's just one of the movies problems. The basic plot surrounds the CIA recruiting Xander Cage (again) because they need him to track down and find a mcguffin that can control and bring down satellites from orbit like missiles. Yes Xander Cage was thought to be dead but low and behold he's not, because of course. Get used to nonsense like this because in this franchise apparently no one dies, they could come back at any time.So the bad guys who have stolen this mcguffin are of course a small diverse band of villains consisting of Xiang (Donnie Yen the martial artist). Talon (Tony Jaa the kickboxing martial artist), Serena Unger (Deepika Padukone an Indian actress) and Hawk (Michael Bisping a British MMA fighter). To combat these guys Xander brings in his own little diverse band of misfits consisting of Harvard Zhou (Kris Wu a Chinese model/singer/actor). Adele Wolff (Ruby Rose an Australian model/DJ/actress/TV presenter), and Tennyson (Rory McCann a Scottish actor). Anyone else notice that the special forces team Xander is originally offered and rejects (before bringing in his own team), seemed to be all black guys apart from one guy. And the jungle rave scene that had men and women of various races...except for white blokes. Just my observations.Anyway I'm not having a go at diversity but when you have these little teams of people that appear to be so painfully and obviously picked so as not to upset anyone and to try and include literally everyone, it just comes across as kinda daft. Dare I say unrealistic, but Christ what am I saying, look at the movie I'm reviewing here. The intro sequence sees Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) trying to recruit fecking Neymar Jr. for flips sake! For anyone not in the know he's a soccer/football player.But yeah, five minutes into the movie and I almost switched off. The entire intro is an utter shambles of stunt doubles, greenscreen and CGI, its horrendous garbage. Cage climbs and then jumps off some huge aerial tower with skies attached to his feet. He then proceeds to land perfectly in the jungle and skiing down the hills through the thick undergrowth. He then picks up his personal skateboard from some shack and proceeds to whip down the mountainous road dodging oncoming traffic or just bouncing off it. At the end we see his skateboard actually has his xXx logo on it. I swear it was some 'Batman and Robin' sh*t right there.Amazingly I expected the movie to continue along this absurd line of bullshit but I was actually wrong! The movie does in fact take time to try and build something of a plot. It of course totally fails because this movie literally has no villains. What do I mean? Well the small band of diverse bad guys I mentioned turn out to be Triple X agents and are in fact trying to do the same thing as Cage. Yes there is indeed another villain in their midst, not hard to work out really, standard plot twist stuff. But when you do find out you'll also realise what I mean by this movie having no real antagonist.But going back to my original take, a Bond clone/rip-off, yeah it kinda is really. It has all the standard spy guff that you'd expect including a young sexy female equivalent of Bond character Q. There is nothing new here, stupid stunt sequences like riding motorbikes with skis on water, jumping out of planes with no chutes, fighting on top of moving trucks, fighting on a highway in traffic, getting hit by cars but not getting injured, slow motion gun battles by the sexy female characters etc...All this but with shitty looking CGI and shitty looking greenscreen work. Oh and to top all that, Ice Cube makes a cameo when the good guys are in trouble...but then just disappears into obscurity again. Why would his character just pop up for one shoot out and not help out further? Why wouldn't his character be in the entire movie?Honesty I can't remember the original two movies in this franchise. I know the second was more of a straight to DVD affair but the first movie was better than this surely? This doesn't even feel like a stand alone movie, it just feels like a 'Fast and Furious' spin-off flick. Hell this movie and the newer FaF movies are virtually the same sh*t! Just a bunch of over the top action sequences slapped together around a flimsy, non-existent plot. Stick in a load of half naked girls, rap/hip hop music and rave/party sequences where everyone looks sweaty and voila! Apparently movies like this make lots of money nowadays. This movie was so artificial, simply aiming to be hip, trendy and cool (über marketable to impressionable teens). All style no substance, tacky, lazy, definitely not sexy and definitely not cool. Just cringeworthy on every level.1.5/10",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

49,dave-mcclain,"""xXx: Return of Xander Cage"" is completely ridiculous – in a really, really good way.",7,21 January 2017,"""xXx: Return of Xander Cage"" (known as ""xXx: Reactivated"" outside the U.S.) will really get your heart pumping. No, the ""Movie Fan Community"" Facebook Page is not reviewing porn flicks now. ""xXx"" refers to a secret U.S. government program which recruits extreme sports athletes and other agile anti-social types to be spies and go on especially dangerous missions for the NSA. The first film in the franchise, simply entitled ""xXx"", starred Vin Diesel as rebellious extreme athlete Xander Cage and came out in 2002. Vin Diesel declined to return for the 2005 sequel and was replaced by a character named Darius Stone, played by rapper-turned-actor Ice Cube. After a not-so-uncommon extended delay, Hollywood finally produced another sequel: the aforementioned ""xXx: Return of Xander Cage"" (PG-13, 1:47).xXx founder Augustus Gibbons is still busy recruiting uniquely qualified physical specimens with bad attitudes for his secret spy program, this time making his pitch to Brazilian footballer Neymar (playing himself in his film debut) when someone suddenly drops a spy satellite on their location. Intelligence official Jane Marke (Toni Collette) takes over for Gibbons and sets out to find the original xXx, Xander Cage (Diesel), who was assumed to be dead, but is living in self-imposed exile in the Dominican Republic. After a great extreme action sequence with a payoff that I won't spoil, Cage is tracked down by Marke who uses an elaborate ruse to get his attention and then explains why she needs him to be xXx again.A small electronic device called ""Pandora's Box"" (named after the story in Greek mythology in which a woman opened a container which unleashed all the world's evils) has fallen into the wrong hands. This thing can control all of the spy satellites circling the earth and can be used to help the operator spy on anyone – or to change an orbit of any one of those satellites, causing it to crash to earth – at any chosen coordinates. A quartet of acrobatic and ruthless thieves (Donnie Yen, Deepika Padukone, Tony Jaa and Michael Bispring) dramatically steal the device, then hide out, deciding what to do with their new toy.Aboard an impressively outfitted military plane, Cage learns the details of the threat of that whole sky-is-falling thing. He also meets hyper but talented and uninhibited computer hacker Becky Clearidge (a bespectacled, adorable and hilarious Nina Dobrev) who has cooked up a number of gadgets that would make both James Bond and the Avengers proud. Cage comedically but emphatically rejects the ground team (led by ex-NFLer Tony Gonzalez) that Marke had assembled to help him and gathers a team that he can trust because they are ""the good, the extreme and the completely insane"" (Ruby Rose, Kris Wu and Rory McCann). After help from an old friend (Hermione Corfield) – and some ""undercover work"" – Cage tracks Pandora's Box to the Philippines. That's where the fun really begins – and with plot twists galore.""xXx: Return of Xander Cage"" is completely ridiculous – in a really, really good way. This is a great action film which never takes itself too seriously. Cage and his cohorts fight, shoot, duck and dodge, and even ride motorcycles (outfitted with skis) on the ocean with spirit, sarcasm and smiles. The acting is appropriately tongue-in-cheek, but the cast is solid – and includes a couple cool surprises late in the movie. The stunts are mainly of the don't-try-this-at-home variety and the plot is just thin enough to accommodate the entertaining mayhem. Some moments will produce eye rolls from even the most tolerant xXx fans, but this film does the series proud – and it's fun! ""B+""",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

51,bryank-04844,Dumb and Fun!,7,23 January 2017,"Has it really been 15 years since we last saw Vin Diesel as Xander Cage, jumping off mountains and beating up the bad guys across the globe? Why yes it has. Only a few years later, we got a 'xXx' sequel with Ice Cube in the spotlight, rather than Vin Diesel. It was stated in the sequel that Vin Diesel's character was killed off, leaving Ice Cube to pick up the pieces and become the action star in the early 2000s. Now, it's 2017 and Vin Diesel makes $1 billion dollar 'Fast and Furious' movies, so Hollywood finally gave the greenlight to another 'xXx' film that has Diesel returning as Xander Cage, despite the fact that he's already dead. These things don't matter with this third installment, titled 'xXx: Return of Xander Cage'.Directed by D.J. Caruso ('Disturbia', 'Eagle Eye'), this third sequel takes its cues from the over-the-top action moves of the late 80s and nineties and never looks back. None of the film makes any sense, but then again it's not supposed to. This is a very dumb film, yet it's highly entertaining and very fun from start to finish. Luckily, the film knows exactly what it is and even pokes fun at itself, which makes 'Return of Xander Cage' very tolerable and will even have you laughing out loud throughout. Yes, Xander Cage is very much alive and jumping off towers with no parachutes and skiing down rocky mountains with ease. He is brought in by the CIA to track down a device called 'Pandora's Box' that can spy on anyone at anytime, and even bring down space satellites like missiles and kill people.Xander teams up with a group of other xXx's and come across yet another group of xXx's, including Donnie Yen (I'm one with the force, the force is with me) and Thai master Tony Jaa, who might as well be Michael Jackson in this role. Every other character has there special trait and skill, including being a deejay, crashing vehicles and telling social media about it, and even a tech guru who makes Lincoln jokes and has a safe word. It's all silly, dumb, and so much fun. Luckily, the film never slows down or tries to be serious at any point in time. Every action beat and fight scene would have any superhero die a horrible death in an instant, but this is 'xXx' with Vin Diesel, and nobody dies, let alone get a scratch on their face, even when there is a fist fight in the middle of a highway with tons of on coming traffic.There are for sure some funny performances, but I want to talk about Vin Diesel. I don't understand how this guy gets work. He is literally the worst actor in the world. He is good as a voice actor who can say a few lines, but good God. It's literally painful to watch him on screen, and every time he's on screen here (mind you, he's shirtless most of the time), he is just wretched and awkward. I don't get it. Every time he's on screen, you just wish one of the other characters had screen time instead. Other than that, this film is quite fun, action-packed and ridiculous, which in this day and age, it's good sometimes to turn off your brain and enjoy the grand spectacle. Will there be more 'xXx' films in the future? It looks like it and that's not a bad thing.RECOMMENDED!",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

53,CANpatbuck3664,xXx: Return of Xander Cage Joins the Recent Trend of Disappointing Sequels That Were Made Way Too Late,4,21 January 2017,"I actually enjoyed the original xXx, sure it wasn't the deepest movie but it boasted Vin Diesel in a different type of spy role and some admittedly silly but fun stunts. To be fair that was almost 15 years ago and I was into different things. I wasn't excited for the long awaited sequel but I figured I'd check it out eventually. When a friend of mine invited me to go see it, I shrugged my shoulders and joined him. Most of the critics were putting into their reviews that this was a real ""throwback"" and I didn't really get why. Having seen the movie now, I totally get it. xXx has some of the cheesiest dialogue, most ridiculous action and most nonsensical characters that I've seen in the longest time.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* After the opening credits, a satellite plummets towards the planet. At the same time, we join Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) as he's trying to recruit a new member into the xXx program. He opens with the story of the The Lords of Dogtown and how the drought in California brought this massive change to skateboarding. He views his crusade to continue the xXx program as trying to bring such a change to espionage. Recruiting extreme sports athletes instead of the rich pretty boys, he's shaking things up. His interviewee rejects his offer until an armed robber breaks into the restaurant. Neymar picks up a napkin dispenser and boots it into the robber, knocking him unconscious. Gibbons begins to laugh until the burning satellite strikes the restaurant, killing Gibbons and leaving us wondering how Xander Cage (Vin Diesel) and the rest of the xXx program will continue.Samuel L. Jackson is one of the few returning cast members as most the cast roster is updated. Among the new cast are: Toni Collette, Donnie Yen, Deepika Padukone, Rory McCann, Ruby Rose and Tony Gonzalez. The results are up and down. I think Ruby and Deepika probably fare the best of the newer group, Rose seems to be a natural fit for this kind of material and she slips into it easily. Deepika made for a solid female action hero. Some of the cast weren't used effectively, I wish they had given Donnie Yen some more crazy stuff to do and Samuel L. Jackson who was one of the better parts of the original movies, is barely in it. McCan and Gonzalez were undercut with their characters and while Vin put this role on like an old glove, he wasn't stretching at all. Toni Collette looked like she didn't want to be there, she was probably supposed to be unemotional but she almost seemed like she was angry. I felt bad for Nina Dobrev, she was supposed to be comedic relief but she was overplaying it pretty badly.The acting may not have been the best but we know that this movie's audience isn't going to see Shakespeare in the park, they're looking for some cool action. The action is different here in the way that none of it is plausible at all. I'm willing to let this go sometimes, no one walks into a Marvel movie scoffing that those set-pieces are unrealistic but this movie just couldn't pull off plausible deniability. This is also made worse by the fact the movie has some pretty bad CGI, if the green screen effects looked better, maybe I would have bought the fact that satellites don't burn up in the atmosphere or that a motorcycle on skis can still work on water after it's been submerged completely for a couple of minutes. These action scenes didn't feel fresh and the creative team didn't wink at the camera to let us know it's a parody. The action isn't implausible on purpose and it made the movie feel lazy. On a minor positive note, I did think some of the action did manage to be funny because it was so ridiculous, so there is that.The problem with xXx: Return of Xander Cage isn't the acting or even unbelievable action, it's the script. People complained about Suicide Squad having useless characters, that's a fair criticism but this movie one-ups that. 2 members of Xander's team have no applicable skills at all. One of them crashes cars, he's not an excellent driver, he just knows how to survive crashes. The other is a DJ who knows how to have a good time, that's it? How does that qualify him to be an integral part of an espionage operation? You can see the ending plot twist coming a half hour in (did anyone really think the secret villain was a good guy for more than a second?). The worst part is the cheesy-as-hell dialogue. The movie is overloaded with stupid one-liners that either left me snickering or rolling my eyes. This is some of the worst stuff I've heard since the Pierce Brosnan James Bond movies.The best thing I can say for xXx: Return of Xander Cage is that while it's bad, it's funny bad instead of make you want to leave the theatre bad. Even if I had been laughing the whole time, I still wouldn't call this a good movie because it isn't. The entire time I watched this movie, I thought ""this isn't good enough anymore."" We've grown past this as the viewing public, we expect more from our action movies. I think that unless your nostalgic for the xXx franchise, you're going to have a hard time finding stuff to like in this sequel. I just have to remind myself that it's January. At this time of the year, it's better to prepare for the worst and hope for the best.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

Not sure why people who are not action movie fans go see theses movies expecting high quality acting, drama and a great story.Its no different then the good old 80 and early 90 action movies with Arnold, Stallone and Van damme to be honest.It does not deserve all the bad ratings either because its not that bad.

56,destroyerwod,Not as good as the original but yet fun enough,6,9 February 2017,"The first xXx was pretty cool. It didn't took itself too seriously, yet remained focus and tell a good story. The gadget where also pretty fun. I won't talk about Sate of the Union since Vin was not in it and goes directly to this one.We wanted another Xander Cage movie for a long time and i am happy we got it. But i feel it could had been much better. First of all ill mention the shaky cam is at times annoying. Its not in every scenes thanksfully and nowhere near as bad as Resident Evil The Final Chapter but it did bugged me a bit. The story is a bit all over the place, i don't want to make this review with spoiler so i won't elaborate too much on it but it did left me questioning the motivations of the bad guys.The movie feature a big ensemble of actors, maybe a little too much as sometimes we feel Xander is lost into all these peoples. Donnie Yen is used to his potential but Tony Jaa could had pretty much be anybody. He is wasted. There is 2 characters on Xander's team that really felt useless, to a point i was thinking ""why are they in the movie"" ? There is some nice stunts and original action scenes tough, and its cool to see Xander back as i said above, i guess i would had just wish the movie focus on him again and that the story would had been a little less all over the place searching its identity.This movie remind me a lot of Expendables 3. Too crowded so some characters are really wasted, some very decent action, but probably tried to be too big for its own good.Yet i hope to see a 4th xXx movie and i hope this time its really more about Xander Cage.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

The actors were more part of it witch is great like everyone knows Vin Diesel is in all movie as always skateboard, motorbikes everything you name it !! and new cast is good expect for Toni Collettesimilar thing in movie they Graphic credits like suicide squad or any movie when they introduce the characters. Xiang (Donnie Yen) and his team Talon, Serena Unger, Hawk Were breaking into CIA Building to steal ""Pandora's Box"" has been stolen Jane Marke wants Xander Cage (Vin Diesel)to get him involved they can't catch these guys because they are like ghosts so the are going to get similar case Xander cage is hiding in some Location in Spain doing Crazy Stunts with ice skating when there's is no snow but anyway it's he doing that in bushes and woods going down their then he gets the skateboard rides all the way down see a lot cool stunts to it a lot cool things still everything is talks about first movie when he defeated Anarchy 99 but the thing they don't talk about character Yelena at all like Xander Cage left her in Bora Bora ??? it didn't explain about her character at all. so anyway i am not going to explain anything about Samuel L Jackson character because i never want spoil the movie for people to read review just please go watch movie then you know what i mean. how Xander survived ??? SPOILER never wanted to write it. so anyway Jane wants Xander to have team i am like ?? why does he need a team ?? it's fast and furious 5 ?? Come on Xander cage works alone i love his new attitude's that's the only thing i can deal the problems in this movie but the thing is he doesn't need a team to work on mission in first movie. the team Adele Wolff, Nicks, Tennyson Torch ? come on why can't they hire better actors to be his team ?? these is eh they aren't action stars i expect like Cast UFC Fighters expect you have Hawk (Michael Bisping)Ice Cube is cameo in movie he is not in it as much he is in it in almost of end of movie witch is GREAT to have him back. the action scenes were so good i loved action scenes so much little bit of shaky cameras not much witch is good buy hey the story and action is a lot better then Stupid and clumsy remake point break (2015) unless this has a lot better and different and cgi is a lot better and first movie had great cgi there is a lot great fight scenes in martial arts Donnie yen is acting more speaking English is a lot of proofing and Tony Jaa is usually he is more in it then fast 7 i would say he's character is a lot more better then fast 7 because he didn't do much in it. but in this yeah there is a lot of great fight scenes with stunt doubles for Tony Jaa crazy stunts. Deepika Padukone is OK she is not annoying at all but she is OK not fan noting much to say about her so as ruby rose playing sniper girl i would say she a lot better then Toni Collette. (Nina Dobrev) Becky play's the character like Michael Roof may rest in peace that's why he is not back she play's annoying well not annoying like you wanna punch her in face like Michael Roof Character Toby Lee Shavers but she is female version of that character giving all guns and spy equipment staff you have pretty cool staff in film. a lot of enjoyable fun action scenes in film unrealistic scenes like fast and furious franchise a lot that. the story is just simple and it's great movie great to have it back but don't worry about the haters they are so wrong for hating this movie ?? it's still great you have most of events from first movie noting wrong with this movie just has all action for action fans people just don't understand who knows what they want in their opinion for movie believe go and see it if you seen First 2 Triple X movies then see this. it's so good can't wait for Xander cage and Darius Stone teaming up together.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
60,p-jonsson,Disappointing,4,12 June 2017,"I must confess that I did have higher hopes for this movie. I'm not sure what the script writers was up to when writing it but they really seem to have a very low opinion of the audience's intelligence. Either that or it was written for a very young audience.There were parts of the movie that was quite fun to watch but on the whole it was pretty much a mess. It is a shame because it had quite a bit of promise. The core of the plot was not too bad although I really wish that Hollywood writers would stay away from plots involving computer gadgetry. Their knowledge in that area simply stinks. Thus the gadget that the entire movie was spun around was simply stupid.Unfortunately another core plot element was the crooked CIA (or whatever department it was supposed to be) boss that of course had to do some senseless backstabbing just to prolong the movie. Tiresome, overused and boring. I know, I know with fucktards like Comey I guess one could say that it would not be too far from the truth but it is still tiresome, overused and boring.Since I am on a rant anyway let's go on to the various stunts and special effects. It is a long time since I watched a movie where the stunts were so obviously and totally overdone and unrealistic. I mean, they were unrealistic to the point where I started to wander if it was a slapstick comedy I was watching.All of this really dragged down the movie  a lot!On the good side. I did like many of the wacky characters. It is a shame that many of their wacky moments were less of a comic relief due to the above mentioned silliness but instead felt like the more serious moments in the movie.Vin Diesel, well I watched this movie because I am a Vin Diesel fan so of course I liked him. He is his usual badass and kick ass self. He is also surrounded by a bunch of badass (and wacky as I mentioned before) characters. I quite liked the ensemble. The guy who seems to collect crashes is rather silly but fun in a strange way. I did like the gun girl a lot.However, apart from quite a few fun and/or cool scenes the movie as a whole did not cut it. In my opinion it was ruined by a substandard script devoid of any form of intelligence. I would go as far as to say that the writers were incompetent pure and simple. I was almost giving it three stars because there was many parts I liked but in the end  no, there is no way I could justify more than two stars for this mess.Really a shame. I would have liked to see more xXx movies but after this one I'm not sure anyone will bet money on that.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
61,Magow-Intermean,xXx: Return Of Xander Cage Review,9,23 March 2019,"Extreme-sports dude turned superspy Xander Cage (Diesel) returns from the not-dead to a world that needs him more than ever. Especially now a rogue named Xiang (Yen) and his gang have got their mitts on ""Pandora's Box"" - a deadly doohickey that can control all the globe's military satellites...
Vin Diesel just can't resist a comeback, can he? After sitting two Fast & Furious movies out, he rolled by once more as Dominic Toretto, back at the wheel to drive his team to new glories. Pitch Black's sci-fi anti-hero Richard B. Riddick surprised everyone by popping back up nine years after the preposterous Chronicles Of Riddick should by rights have buried him. And now, almost 15 years since inking up his Eternian-proportioned torso to play Xander Cage in the first xXx movie (dodging a bullet that hit Ice Cube full on with 2005's woeful xXx: State Of The Union), here he is again, ripened and ready to save another day - or should that be franchise?
Diesel's certainly not afraid to plagiarise his return-performance success as Toretto. Aside from the tattoos, the only discernible difference between the two outlaw day-savers is that one bangs on about ""family"", while the other sticks to sticking it to The Man. Here he even pulls together a Nesquick-instant team of ""X"" agents, despite only ever having worked alone before faking his death and spending a decade-and-a-half hiding out. An international mix of slinky chicks, hunky chumps and plucky wisecrackers, it's like someone slammed the F&F crew on a scanner. This one-man army never likes to work alone.Still, his heart's in the right place (his fist), and so's his tongue (right there in his cheek). Return Of Xander Cage should be taken as seriously as candy floss should be treated as food, and it sprinkles its oh-so-familiar action nonsense with knowing winks - though Vin still can't quite sell a zinger, bless 'im. Plus, it has Donnie Yen to properly kick ass (in one scene apparently dressed as Danny Zuko), and a surprise cameo that's so preposterous it's possibly brilliant.It's all clearly a set up for further instalments (yes, like that other Diesel-powered series), and despite all the silliness it leaves you feeling, ""oh all right, you twisted my arm"". If only to stop Diesel making The Last Witch Hunter: Return Of Kalder...",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
62,colewaters,Xxx return of Xander Cage,10,23 January 2017,Where do I start on this magnificent blockbuster hit that is XXX Return of Xander Cage staring Vin Diesel. I saw this movie in IMAX 3D and I was blown away of how good the 3D was. Vin Diesel never disappoints. There was not one flaw with this film the action was some of the best action sequences I have ever seen in my whole life. This is the third engagement in the XXX series and it has been the best so far.Parents this is rated PG-13 for action and violence throughout the film and it is highly suggested because it has a lot of action and a lot of bikinis. We see Xander a lot of the film with a women and there are a lot of women in this movie so there is another thing to think about if you are going to take your little ones. This has been such a good year for movies so far and I think they will just keep on getting better from thereThis is a great film I think you will really enjoy it,xXx - Return of Xander Cage
63,scottshak_111,He shouldn't have returned,6,11 May 2017,"Mindless action! xXx Return of Xander Cage bends laws of physics, banks on clichéd action at times to deliberately showcase what its director thinks ""would look cool"" stunts. It has cheesy lines galore, and a really insipid plot in its baggage. The worst however remains, that instantly piercing and bothering demeanour that Vin Diesel wears throughout the flick. His smugness is the worst. It makes you go, ""Is this guy for real?"" Overlook Vin and you see how hollow, clichéd, stupid and pointless the whole movie is.Plot of xXx Return of Xander Cage (Spoilers)Presumably dead the legend, Xander Cage (the one who gets on your nerves avatar of Vin Diesel) from the first one, is hunted down by CIA to bring a stolen device called Pandora's Box back. It is a device that can ensue destruction on a massive scale, since it holds the reins of military satellites. To successfully complete the mission he hires his own team, deliberately throwing an unprepared bunch of soldiers out of a moving plane. Whaaaat?Wait, that's nothing. He breaks a gun, yes! a frigging gun with his knees just to prove a point! He brags a lot about himself, or let others go on and on about him, which gets on your nerves.To make matters further indigestible, he goes on a bike chase in the sea. I repeat, in the sea! When that's going on, you wonder if they plan on ever stopping. A water station maybe? To get some gas? They appear as if they were planning on crossing the ocean on their bikes.The CompetitionHis competition is Xiang portrayed by Donnie Yen who is the guy Cage is supposed to race to get the Pandora's box before he does. Xiang has plans of his own and a team too. Eventually both the teams end up joining hands to fight the double-crossing government instead. In words of Sebastian from La La Land:""It is all very very exciting.""All seemingly cool frames seem very deliberately created just to prove a scene. There is one bit that shows Cage playing with grenades with Xiang and Serena (Deepika Padukone). What a way to make a conversation! *Facepalm* It is hands down one of the most forced scenes in the movie, and makes it very laughable. You know, spoofs get made because of such absurdity!Oh wait! Cage gets shot too. You know when in a movie hero would get shot, a voice in your head would always go, ""he must be wearing a bulletproof vest? Or the bullet might have been stopped by an impenetrable object? Well the former's your answer.Yes, the story is as if a kid wrote it. I remember thinking all that stuff when I was five.All the ShootingThen there is that clichéd gun fight scene too, where two badass chicks come out in the open and then shoot at random army of villains who somehow never stop coming. Yes the one where they are leaning against each other's backs to look dope. Yeah! It's all in there.Just then to break the monotony, everyone's bullets run out, and you predict the director has something up his sleeve, in comes the protagonist from the second part, which was an even shittier movie. Ice Cube comes with a grenade launcher reprising his role as Darius Stone and the music in the background turns into a rap. It is supposed to mean the ""Lord is here!""Tony Jaa gets a role of a psychotic fighter who looks like he has been on a strict Red Bull diet all his life. Nina Dobrev plays the one fun character that we have seen in so many movies before that it should actually cease to exist. But no! Every movie has it.Deepika Padukone doesn't cause any ripples either. She seems weirdly out of place whenever she comes to do her bit. Her icky walk to meet Xiang would make you wonder what the director must have been expecting to see, and what came out as a result. And he chose to include it too.And what's with the tats? The director D.J. Caruso seems like he must have been saying: We should not leave the tattoo! Let him wear a Capri so that the tattoos show!Worthy BitsIf you still expect something cool to happen, then it is Donnie Yen's fight bits that takes off the heat for a while. You watch him go full Ip Man on rogue soldiers and you get your money's worth then and there with his badass action moves. Inclusion of known faces from the past, like Darius Stone too at one point makes you smile.Amongst other worthy scenes, okay, now I am drawing a blank.If you are a huge Vin Diesel fan, you can still watch it.The Final VerdictxXx Return of Xander Cage is nothing but a fully flawed flick. If you are a die-hard Vin Diesel fan, and are ready to accept him in every avatar he portrays, this movie might make you happy.To be honest, nobody remembers the first XXX movie. Now when did that happen? 15 years ago! I was a kid back then and might have mistakenly considered Xander Cage to be cool.So far Vin has been mighty successful in the Fast and Furious series. He should stick to that. Because at least the direction and story there weaves up something worth watching. It lets us digest all the nonsensical stunts.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

It's a damn shame that the current actors and characters there where able to build onto and improve such as Vin Diesel for the original XXX, Ice Cube as the newer XXX, Samuel L.

Mostly because of good action scenes (Ong Bak), or because you can see that the actors are enjoying their parts (Expendables).But not here. I was able to enjoy part 1 and 2. Those movies worked on various levels. Even after expecting nothing from part 3, it was a disappointment beyond belief. Vin Diesel's stone cold attitude doesn't work, because the boredom is dripping through his pores. Every line, and I mean every line feels as a copy/paste one-liner, but without the success it might have had in other movies. Some action scenes with Donnie Yen and Tony Jaa are a pleasure, but their acting is so horrible and uninspired, that even their fighting can't save the momentum.XXX-3 fails as an action film. Unfortunately it also fails as a wannabe comedy. And it fails miserably as a Expendables-clone. Lets just say it fails as any product it tried to be and could have been.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
69,kaptenvideo-89875,"Young, dumb and full of vision",6,29 January 2017,"In a way, Vin Diesel is a unique movie star. He is neither black or white, he is a man of action but also able to do serious stuff although these projects tend to tank hard or go unnoticed. AND the best-known part of his career consists of long-term action franchises which make you forget about realism, favoring big explosions, gravity-defyingly bombastic stunts and enough glamour to make you 12-year old self go green with envy. The world presented here represents pretty much of a teenage boys' fantasy of adulthood. Everybody's cool, tough and super competent, regardless of their sex.Diesel's best known work is Fast and the Furious"" and xXx"" feels like its crazy younger sibling. It has the same structure – Diesel and his trusty crew do dangerous stuff that no one else even dares to think of – and philosophy about the importance of loyalty and ""family"" and how to be the best.But there is less fast cars and setpieces are even more outlandish, which rely so heavily on digital effects that even some of the action movie fans are calling it stupid already. I mean, they go so ballistic this time that comparisions with Bollywood are not far anymore.Return of Xander Cage"" is too brash and outlandish to earn a comparison with Mission: Impossible"" or James Bond, but it can be seen as Diesel's answer to Sylvester Stallone's The Expendables"" series. It's comparably dumb, has comparably weak screenplay and dialogue, and has comparably exciting cast of kickass characters – including two Asian martial arts cinema stars. Donnie Yen and Tony Jaa. Of course, Stallone's collection of screen legends will always look cooler but Diesel's crew of young guns is very likable also.So, that's it. If you like impossible mission spy movies and are able to spend two hours in the world where everything is possible and the good guys are indestructible, you will find a lot to like in the new xXx"". At nearly two hours, it's probably too long. But enough is happening throughout the movie, to justify spending the time. At least for me.It's too dumb to be taken seriously but in a world where superhero movies regularly do at least half a billion dollars at box office, there's surely some room for Vin Diesel's particular take on the impossible action subgenre.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
70,ebossert,Better Than Almost Every Superhero Film from the Last Decade,9,20 January 2017,"Note: Check me out as the ""Asian Movie Enthusiast"" on YouTube, where I review tons of Asian movies.Just got back from a screening. All I can say is that the current 5.6 rating on IMDb is a damn joke. I really think people do not understand what a good action movie is anymore. We've been inundated with so many bloated, poorly paced comic book movies (that take themselves so seriously that they demand completely unnecessary 150 minute runtimes) that we've lost sight of what pure entertainment actually is. Hell, less than a month ago I saw a Star Wars movie that took 90 minutes to get to a decent action scene.Return of Xander Cage is easily the best paced, big budget action film since Mad Max: Fury Road. Don't get me wrong, because it is an incredibly stupid film, but it's also damn entertaining from start to finish. For example, Donnie Yen is finally allowed to do what he does best in a Hollywood movie. It's not rocket science - let the guy kick some ass. The only negative that popped out to me was the awkward sexual innuendos near the beginning, which felt very out of place and a bit cringeworthy. Other than that, this is fantastic action trash that everyone should go out to support.You get 3 action scenes within the opening 30 minutes, then a truckload of action afterward. Just as importantly, every single moment between the action is used to drive things forward. This movie does not waste time, so it safely avoids the ""dull filler"" that can drag these movies down. I really enjoyed the cast as well. It may have been a corporate suit who decided to cast a different actor from every country for the purposes of box office appeal, but it felt like these people had a blast making this movie and they seemed to have good chemistry together despite the fact that the character development was basic at best. Tony Jaa ditches his serious mug for a loony, dance-crazy role that had me in stitches. Nice to see ""The Hound"" from Game of Thrones here too.The action is completely ridiculous, but it's certainly plentiful enough and has good enough quality to be satisfying. There are certain instances that overuse editing, but it's only an issue at certain points and I was not distracted by it for most of the runtime. It's certainly better than most of Paul Greengrass's titles.I almost never say this about a big budget Hollywood action film, but I want a damn sequel!",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
71,dasa108,"Could be worst, at least is fun.",7,14 December 2020,"Vin Diesel, like Samuel L. Jackson or Morgan Freeman, always makes himself. Their characters are one-dimensional, and have the same depth of a coin. Here we see him returning from retirement (we were tricked into the second film that had died) to help some cheerful and armed Brazilians watch a football match without paying the cable. We also learned that there is a group of well-trained athletes capable of circumventing the safety of an extremely guarded place and as if it were blowing and making bottles steal an artifact that hides the power to bring down satellites as if they were drops of stale. The latter gave a final touch to the life of Samuel Jackson, who after eating with Neymar had poor digestion with a highly spiced satellite over his head. Luckily Neymar was saved. As in The Fast and the Furious, XXX decides to assemble his team, to which he keeps as much fidelity as ""The Family"" from his most famous series of films. As in James Bond, it's time to travel the world in the company of bureaucratics of dubious morals to finally meet the apparent enemies at an electronic party in a rare area of the Philippines. Here things get curious, because as we again see fashionable singers appearing in supporting roles: here's Nicky Jam and an uncredited Selena Gomez. We see Donnie Yen and Tony Jaa wasted. There is a character who is the romantic interest and is the most unlikely, we are talking about an ultra liberal Hindu, able to embarrass the most sacred traditions of her homeland, and who gives us a marketing lesson: if you want to sell a movie globally enough to put to work a white (Diesel), a black (Jackson), a Chinese (Yen) , a Thai (Jaa), a Hindu (Padukone) and put as main song one by Nicky Jam.

Movie starts with Xander Cage style but then he adds a skate board, seriously Vin D you are too old for this. The Triple X 2002 was an excellent movie the 2005 with Ice Cube was overly pathetic cause we all know Ice Cube shoots the entire movie standing in one damn spot. Nevertheless this addition has not matched up to the one in 2002. Same old lines, same old dialogues and the fur coat of Xander cage was forcibly brought into the movie as if it was not part of the script no one would have realized its was Xander cage. Deepika Padukone marks her entry into the Hollywood and she is one of those Bollywood actors who would do almost anything ""IF THE SCRIPTS DEMAND"". Nina Dobrev was trying too hard to be Mia Khalifa in the movie, she dressed acted and look the same. Too bad no such scene for her.

75,pranayjalvi,Dumb Movie and no fun,5,26 March 2017,"'Return of Xander Cage', as the name suggests, returns to stunt-CGI-action to provide it's adrenaline rush. This is basically Diesel's show and he is well aided by the stunt choreography, CGI action and editing speed. But don't go by looks. There's not much energy in the telling here and the confused narrative totally sidelines logic. The narrative is segmented and even the action is cut and joined together in a million places. So there's no smooth progressive transition happening in the action set-pieces. It is a film borne out of extensive market surveys: in its dismissal of the ideas of nationhood and politics. Very Sad that Deepika Padukone couldn't make an outstanding Hollywood Debut.My Rating 2.5/5",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
76,FelipeCarrillo,Someone Has to Kick This Filmic Mess' Ass,3,22 January 2017,"In a world lacking of glorious heroes, who better than Neymar (Brazilian soccer player) to prevent the end of the human race; just with the laughable and banal opening, the film gives a minimum sign of the scabrous experience in which you'll be immersed, no, in this case, the appropriate word is not 'immerse', the correct word would be endure.In front of heterogeneous movie proposals which inaugurate this year, ""xXx"" title itself does not portend no good, and however, for daredevils or unlikely fans of the ""prodigious"" saga who decide to buy a ticket will have to put up with a permanent vulnerability towards your eyes, ears, reality perceptions, aesthetic hyperesthesia, authentic credibility and decency conception.Anyone who considers that ""Fast & Furious"" saga is quite sophisticated or ""James Bond"" franchise pretty misogynist; Hollywood, the place in where anything is contingent, has made a catalog of frivolous films, in which the primary thing is its action scenes of dubious likelihood, that ones pile up on the screen without mercy along by thunderous musical accompaniments.One of the exiguous achievements that the film runs with determination is that it is not imperative to see the hollow prequels since they add new characters and also offer one succinct explanation of ""Triple X"" organization, you must consume it with objective eyes. Xander Cage is now 49 years old, the last time that they mention him was as deceased person, however, this one was simply a pretext for its sequel ""XXX: State of the Union"" (starring by Ice Cube) in order to leave the path free, clearly, it was another legitimate worthless film, both for critics as audience. Now, Cage takes refuge in the Dominican Republic, a country in which he scales a huge power tower, descends a whole jungle in ski and slides along a road in skate, all this for his beloved new community can see a football game, is there something more ineffective and ridiculous? Although the franchise is characterized by delivering vast portions of absurd e implausible components such as its impossible scenes taking fiction to unbearable limits, we do not require more of this, nobody asked for it and perhaps nobody will ever seek it.The Pandora's box, a mechanism operating all satellites orbiting Earth planet, has fallen into wrong hands, for avoiding this, Security National Agency resorts again to services of the agent and extreme sports lover for rescuing it and thus saving to the world of a threat, which does not look like something lethal due to its constant change of position.Cage will set up a team of maladjusted people to achieve his aim: Tennyson (Rory McCann) a Daredevil in the real life, Nicks (Kris Wu) a well versed machinist, Talon (Tony Jaa) a DJ and the best inside this CGI hell, Adele Wolff (Ruby Rose) an attractive and fearless sniper.It expects to be promoted in arduous and demanding celluloid world through celebrities of different subjects: Neymar, he is more than detestable in his role as superman, seriously, if he is a footballer, is a footballer; Ariadna Gutierrez, Colombian miss universe (at least by some seconds), looks like if she was in a video clip, If she is a professional model, is simply a model; Nicki Jam, the Colombian singer, is surplus and is feels superfluous in the story, however, among all that core social, he does well, if he is a singer, is a singer.None of them have acting skills and although the effort of adding cultural diversity to the film has a good heart, it reduces what little has been achieved.Becoming a model to follow for the sexist and English-speaking Hollywood of the 21st century, in the film are only female roles dazzle on screen, being Rose and Bollywood's rising star Deepika Padukone who interpret action sequences and characters as theatrical as memorable, they and irregular Nina Dobrev are those who rescued a portion of the length feature, the rest is missing time.Execrable antagonists, scenes with CGI so palpable that we could even perceive cables and green screens behind Vin Diesel, a script with insignificant punch-lines, a development jam-packed with tedium and boredom and worst of all, a direction palliating negatively the miserable movie. If you want to make an action motion picture with analogous and inexorable dialogs, an interesting story, with real suspense and solid thematic must avoid a simple name at all costs: D. J. Caruso.Boring, unstable, fatiguing, unsustainable and unbearable, ""xXx"" is the first big mess in 2017, nobody asked for it but unceasingly continues arriving. There is no one best way to describe celluloid's substance than Samuel L. Jackson does it: kick some ass, get the girl and try to look dope while you doing it; sadly, leaving ""dope"" to miles away, it gets these three requirements explicitly because are stipulated in the script.

He's still quite a bad actor and too big and heavy for us to believe he could pull of the athletic stuff his character does. Still, he's got that certain Vin Diesel charm. He's helped by kick-ass Ruby Rose, Deepika Padukone and Chinese-American movie martial arts guru Donnie Yen. Unfortunately, screenwriter F.

A 50 year old man looking like Telly Savalas with tattoos and moobs wearing a donkey jacket trying to be a 20 year old sex symbol skateboarding , surfing on a motorbike - doing parkour etc this movie full of misogyny is so cringeworthy and embarrassing to watch it's untrue . It was difficult to stay to the end but I just hoped that maybe it would get better. If you want a spy action movie then Bond or Bourne are a safe bet but this rubbish is just cashing in on the name of Vin Diesel in between Fast and Furious films. His character died in the first film in 2002 and that's where the franchise should've died too . Ice Cube from XXX 2 makes a cameo and if you suffered that then you'll be so pleased to see him again ! There were a couple of strong female roles a gun toting lesbian and a Bollywood star but even that seemed improbable as she succumbed to the lack of charm of Cage. Toni Colette is an excellent actress but even her credibility doesn't add to the movie. The best part of the film was the end credits as it finally meant the film was over ! Phew ! If your name is Vin Diesel then you might enjoy this self fantasy drivel and if you're a die hard fan of the man you might do too.I hoped there would be more to the film , it sad to think this is what draws a crowd to the cinema these days there are just so many better films out there . if you're impartial do not waste your money .",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

Then there's the film's lines, bad is putting it nicely, one scene a Secretary tells vin that his guns are bigger than the terminator, yeah okay sure, asking him if he's 250 pounds in weight, ahem yes vins in shape bit mot that big and arms bigger than Arnold, yeah okay. The action scenes were too over the top, yes that's right sometimes something can be to much. And that is the problem with is film, they tried to hard to put everything into this movie and what comes out is a complete mess, it was terrible from the scenes that I have mentioned above to the acting which was way below par.

82,lediscipledessocrates,All Downhill Since XXX,2,24 February 2017,"When I watched XXX in 2002 all those years ago, there was something very fresh about the movie. I am not saying it was a movie that would make the critic's list , but it was a thoroughly entertaining movie which you would definitive re-watch should it be telecast on Television again while you were having dinner. Since that time , however, the franchise ( it should not have been created in the first place) has gone to the dogs. And even they have had better options to chew on since pet-food became a fad . If XXX-State of the Union (2005) was ridiculous and laughable , the return of Xander Cage does no wonders either . So now we know , that it just wasn't about Ice Cube being a super-agent that seemed odd. Vin Diesel too looks off colour in this movie.Had this movie been a wannabe replica of the original film, one could have forgiven the team. But this movie carries along a very tedious and mundane baggage from The Fast and The Furious series. The bad guys are clueless, the good guys are boring , the action sequences pretentious but unattractive ( In XXX they were at least attractive even if pretentious; in fact that was the charm of that movie). If someone entered the hall after 10 minutes , he would have mistakenly concluded that he was watching the making of TFATF 15 . I , personally was merely expecting a decent and simple action movie with slick dialogue and action scenes. Instead I got a silly and boring film which is really not worth watching .",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
83,SpoilerAlertReviews,Kicked a** and looked dope while doing it.,5,31 January 2017,"It's fifteen years on since Xander Cage bounced, slid and x-gamed across the big screens, one year after the success of the first Fast and Furious instalment with same director Rob Cohen. And according to the storyline, Xander Cage has been successfully playing dead for all those years. D.J. Caruso takes the helm, who's never had any major blockbusters, but the man behind not- terrible films like I Am Number 4, Disturbia and my personal favourite of his, being Two For The Money. Vin Diesel doesn't come alone this time round, forging a team out of international, Expendable rejects, but it's quite a team of recognisable faces. Game of Thrones' Hound, Rory McCann plays a stunt driver, Orange is The New Black star Ruby Rose plays a keen sniper, and I don't understand the purpose or need for Korean popstar, Kris Wu's character, I honestly think they just added him in purely for fun. On the opposing side is Donnie Yen who replaces Jet Li. Possibly a much welcomed addition after his increased success and popularity with last month's Rogue One. Ong Bak star, Tony Jaa joins the frail as an overactive, over-excited action junkie and Bollywood superstar Deepika Padukone makes her Hollywood debut here, after not being able to commit to the Fast and Furious franchise. Though she might not be known to the wider audience, she certainly makes her presence known here. What's great about Caruso's xXx is that he allowed the characters/actors to be themselves, encouraging them to express their real accents instead of having false ones which could have offended an audience. It's loaded with heavy hitting cameos too, UFC fighters and an international football star. (Don't ask me who, I don't follow football) but what is does lack is a good soundtrack like the first xXx, tracks from Soil, Drowning Pool and of course, Rammstein impressively performing Feuer Frei for the film. But there is none of that on this one apart from a couple of scratches on some decks. Everything else about the film is ridiculous and totally unbelievable, having a rehashed plot with little intelligence and pointless characters. However, the action is good, even if outrageously silly with plenty of ""oh come on"" moments, it looks pretty and is entertaining, almost farcical. Donnie Yen delivers the punches (and kicks) superbly so fans shouldn't be disappointed but the grand finale lets the rest of the movie down, almost as if it's run out of juice. The ending is partly reminiscent of a Star Wars battle, band of misfit rebels fight down below on the ground trying to secure communications while Xander battles for survival and humanity up on the Death Star. Its stupid, but it doesn't pretend to be otherwise, and really, what are we expecting? and with films like Lion, Jackie, Silence and Manchester By The Sea being out, this actually comes as a refreshing, brainless actioner that is just good ol' cheesy fun. It does kick some a*s, and it does look dope while doing it. Oh, Xander's jacket has grown since his last film! Really needs some grooming!

85,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,5,23 January 2017,"Having been taking a few years for a sequel to surface especially after its first sequel was critically panned and was a box office bomb, Vin Diesel takes a moment out of the Fast and Furious franchise (with an 8th film due for release in April) and returns to star and produce in this fun packed, often dumb but quite entertaining sequel that may put the series back in the spotlight against F&F.Let's get right to it, it's better than the last one but a big overstep from the first film but then again time has changed since the first xXx film. The story line isn't original enough with twists that could be predicted early but it does pack some solid, over the top and fast paced action sequences that are really good. The plot sees Xander Cage return to action when he's recruited to retrieve a powerful device that can cause global chaos, teaming up with his small band of adrenaline seekers they go up against not only a dangerous crew just as them but a fair more dominant enemy.The cast overall are all likable and seem to have fun throughout their roles, with Diesel being his usual macho man dude, Sam L Jackson in a short appearance but provides some laughs, Nina Dobrev in a geek nerd turn from her well known role in The Vampire Diaries, and Australian actress and model Ruby Rose makes her big screen debut as a wickedly charming and lethal sniper in which was one of the best things about the film in my opinion (I will admit I like her). I also loved Rory McCann's role as well, providing some laughs and being a completely different character compared to his grimmer role in Game of Thrones.The action set pieces are all entertaining, exciting and pretty much in your face. With stunt work that has 'bs' marked in terms of reality but being a popcorn flick it does fit the tone to the film well, not taking itself too seriously.Overall, a fun and stupendously over the top return for the franchise, though it's hard to say if there will be another to follow. With humour that can hit or miss but packed with crazy enough action, this is worth a watch on a lazy afternoon with the guys or on date night.2/5 stars- The Autistic Reviewers.

Always driving petrol, I never really liked him 100%, but generally have had a good time during his movies. As was this case.Lucky me, the Hollywood trend to associate with Chinese producers to penetrate the huge Chinese market, paid well for me, introducing my favorite Donnie Yen in the XXX wanna-be franchise.

Plotwise, it is Mission Impossible with extreme sports. Vin Diesel is good with mingling with other casts, but as a lead in this one, he is a bit off mark. Compared to the original Triple X, his character seems super human, and more like an extreme sports James Bond. The main highlight of course is Donnie Yen, who steals the scene. Toni Collette seemed like an evil Pamela Landy from the Bourne franchise and does not get to shine. She is just a cardboard character. Kris Wu's inclusion was just to impress K Pop fans, as his character was useless and expendable. Tony Jaa was great but criminally under-used. There was a nice cameo from Ice Cube, but does not help lift the material much. So, I guess the movie was an attempt to cash in on Diesel's star power from the Fast and Furious franchise but does not seem to work.

I just wish Darius Stone (Ice Cube) were in it throughout the whole movie because all the other earlier XXX who we knew nothing about at all were just dropped in our lap like here you go without leading up to or telling us anything about them at all. Gibbons disappearing act from just as the movie started until just as the movie ended was pretty good this time. This time it seemed like a team (which reminded me of the Fast and Furious franchise) most of which we knew nothing about other than Vin Diesel and the other to main high profile stars. The story line should have had a longer build up especially to elaborate on all the other XXX who we know nothing about. The special effects & the action was great though. It just threw us right into the main plot the main events it definitely needed a longer story line build up.

No. It's got Vin Diesel back, but has he learned how to act? No. It's got a lot of one-liners, but do they click? Not a single damn one.There is enough films these days that feature the hammy Samuel L. Jackson, the multiracial cast, the anti-establishment angle and wall-to-wall action without stakes and payoff, that the only way for this to stand out was to make it really, really, really stupid. And it seems they pulled it off.At the beginning of the film, the title character justifies stealing saying: ""I don't wanna line some rich man's pockets"". Funny, that's how I felt paying for the tickets. Had I known what was I in for, I wouldn't even bother stealing them. As for the ""rich man"" himself, that is, Mr. Diesel, he seems to be going through the list of successful films he starred in, trying to figure out which one to make a franchise of next. So, when all other options are eventually exploited, it wouldn't be uncanny to see the resurrection of ""private Caparzo"" in an inevitable sequel to ""Saving Private Ryan"".",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

98,margulanabutrlov,xXx: Return Of Xander Cage Review,9,23 March 2019,"Extreme-sports dude turned superspy Xander Cage (Diesel) returns from the not-dead to a world that needs him more than ever. Especially now a rogue named Xiang (Yen) and his gang have got their mitts on ""Pandora's Box"" - a deadly doohickey that can control all the globe's military satellites...
Vin Diesel just can't resist a comeback, can he? After sitting two Fast & Furious movies out, he rolled by once more as Dominic Toretto, back at the wheel to drive his team to new glories. Pitch Black's sci-fi anti-hero Richard B. Riddick surprised everyone by popping back up nine years after the preposterous Chronicles Of Riddick should by rights have buried him. And now, almost 15 years since inking up his Eternian-proportioned torso to play Xander Cage in the first xXx movie (dodging a bullet that hit Ice Cube full on with 2005's woeful xXx: State Of The Union), here he is again, ripened and ready to save another day - or should that be franchise?
Diesel's certainly not afraid to plagiarise his return-performance success as Toretto. Aside from the tattoos, the only discernible difference between the two outlaw day-savers is that one bangs on about ""family"", while the other sticks to sticking it to The Man. Here he even pulls together a Nesquick-instant team of ""X"" agents, despite only ever having worked alone before faking his death and spending a decade-and-a-half hiding out. An international mix of slinky chicks, hunky chumps and plucky wisecrackers, it's like someone slammed the F&F crew on a scanner. This one-man army never likes to work alone.
Still, his heart's in the right place (his fist), and so's his tongue (right there in his cheek). Return Of Xander Cage should be taken as seriously as candy floss should be treated as food, and it sprinkles its oh-so-familiar action nonsense with knowing winks - though Vin still can't quite sell a zinger, bless 'im. Plus, it has Donnie Yen to properly kick ass (in one scene apparently dressed as Danny Zuko), and a surprise cameo that's so preposterous it's possibly brilliant.
It's all clearly a set up for further instalments (yes, like that other Diesel-powered series), and despite all the silliness it leaves you feeling, ""oh all right, you twisted my arm"". If only to stop Diesel making The Last Witch Hunter: Return Of Kalder...",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
99,El-Ak,Overrated sequel with some good overrated action!,5,21 June 2018,"XXX 3 made itself a bad movie for three reasons show off. show off and overrated showoff. The action scenes are good and a lot of effort was done but in vain cause a lot of mistakes are too obvious in it, I mean who still shots two guns and making me belive he is aiming right! . One of the bad points is trying to make Xander look a hero who shows off a lot with a not very good performance by Diesel. The only one who did a great job was Nina Dobrev in her role which she performed pretty well and can be taken as a disadvantage cause she is the only one in the movie afraid of guns! . Deepika Padukone rather than expected did an awful performance and did some action scenes that are accepted but not too good. The scene of the aeroplane was a disaster one as the plane had a great hole and he could fly with it upwards towards the satellite which when he jumped looked as the plane was going left to it. The visual effects were awful at the sea scene when he was in a chase with Donnie Yen under the wave when it was splashing. The music of the movie was good and was used well in the scenes . Although it had mistakes it was a good movie that entertained me but not much.

100,christophershobris,Another Mindless Popcorn Flick,4,23 January 2017,"Well, this review is going to be pretty basic. This a pretty basic action film, so it fits. There isn't much to say. A silly, mindless excuse for people to go shove popcorn down their throats for some silly, mindless action flick. What? Did you expect some artistic value or Oscar-worthy acting? Of course not. But that's the only thing I can say that is positive is, at least this action flick knows what it is and doesn't try to be something it is not. It's nowhere near as clever as Die Hard or as intense as Live Free or Die Hard, its just here. Vin Diesel is what he is in every film, a G.I. Joe type character with a cool voice. Everyone else is just easily forgettable. Nothing about this film is memorable so, it might as well not even exist. This world wouldn't be any worse without it. The whole XXX franchise is nothing but a bunch of mindless popcorn flicks. The only reason this film will any money is because it's January and is the only real ""big"" film if you wanna call it that of the month. If this was a summer release, it would bomb. I'm sure there are fans of the XXX films, but I'm not one of them. Did I have fun with the film? Sure, in that mindless sort of way where I can just turn my brain off for two hours, that the only redeeming quality this film has. But you can get that out of any action flick. Was the film exciting? Yeah, but I was never on the edge of my seat. Did this film offer anything new or special? No, not really, that's I say, this film doesn't need to exist. It does, and I well I saw it and I just want Beauty and the Beast to come out to be honest. This is just a big budgeted letdown, but in that silly, mindless sort of way. So, its not infuriating, or offensive, just meh. Now to grade.

101,Ben-Hibburd,xXx: Return of Xander Cage review.,2,19 October 2017,"Sigh.....this film is pure trash. Going into this film knowing Rob Cohen was the director I wasn't expecting much, but this CGI heavy, poorly constructed mess was utterly dreadful. The original xXx was a stupid meat-headed action film, but it also had a certain B-movie charm to it, whilst retaining a sense of fun. This sequel/re-hash is a vapid, soulless excuse to have Vin Diesel get his ego stroked and be told how wonderful he is, which was beyond painful to watch. During the course of this film he becomes a caricature of himself.The story is boring, it consists of another stupid device that can hack/control anything on earth...original! Which causes Vin Diesels Xander Cage to come out of hiding to recover. The characters switch allegiances more then they breath fresh air which becomes boring and predictable. The only thing I liked in this film was Ruby Rose's character, she actually had some semblance of a personality. Every other character is wasted for the most part. Yet again Donnie Yen is given nothing to do in another Hollywood film, he looked visibly bored throughout this film which was sad to see.In the end there is no reason for this film to exist. It's the embodiment of everything that's wrong with Hollywood. From the recycled plot/characters to the woeful camera-work and choppy editing. This is your typical poorly made blockbuster cash-grab, that is creatively bankrupt and intellectually insulting.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
102,Eclectic-Boogaloo,XXX: Vin Diesel ego stroking edition,2,28 February 2018,"The solo Dominic Torreto movie nobody asked for, with even less to care about than the FF movies and loads more of VIn Diesel hitting us over the head with how cool he is. The movie plays like a two hour Mountain Dew commercial with Xander Cage, a too cool for school hero straight out of a mentos advertisement.The action is full of senseless cgi where practical effects would have worked, and laughably bad loony tunes caliber stunt physics. But what really hinders the movie is that the hero Xander Cage faces no real drama or obstacles, because the movie is more interested in constantly flattering Vin Diesel.Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time on this lazy vanity project schlock. There's no story here (hence the lack of a plot breakdown). This is a paint by numbers movie star ego boost and nothing more.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

The only reason there are other characters in the film is so they can make Vin Diesel look good. I may come off as a Vin Diesel hater, I'm not, loved his earlier films and the first XXX movie, but come on, you can't argue in favor of his newer movies where he has to look good and never lose.

It was nice seeing Donnie Yen working with Vin and I liked the cameos, which is why I was able to give this movie 5 stars, but the rest of the movie is just mindless action laced with feminism and a predictable plot as most movies have these days.

107,english_artist,Its a shame Vin Diesel is so hard up......,3,6 May 2017,"I watched the other XXX films and really enjoyed them. Yes you know its going to be a 'daft' movie and not something to take seriously.. a bit of fun. Something to turn your brain off to watch.With this movie you would need to remove your brain to watch. Its just to stupid for words. I have not seen this silly kind of kung-fu action in ages and its so dated now. Its something you would have watched back in the 80's and even then it was laughable.We all know these action figures do the impossible and survive but these people can put super heroes to shame just like in the latest fast and the furious its gone to far and we now have superheros instead of just heroes. I think if this trend continues instead of Tom Cruise dangling from ropes in mission impossible he could just hover there instead.Also what is with all the scantly dresses women all over the place and some parts I thought I was watching some soft porn movie rather than an action movie. I am a red blooded male and love women as much as any man but come on do we need it rammed down our throats all the time its cheesy, sleazy and not needed and getting very boring.I could only think Vin Diesel who I enjoy watching in movies such as the first fast and furious movies (before they got silly) and stuff live pitch black has got desperate for some money to be in this.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
108,amichnea,Just WOW!!!!,4,14 May 2017,"The WOW is not how good the movie is but how stupid it was. I imagine it was made for kids or teenagers however Vin is no longer a young actor so seeing him parading with kids which he could father was just silly, especially all the 15 year old girls (OK not 15 but very young women). Most of the actors in the movie (%95) would have not been alive when the first one was made.I was falling asleep, there was nothing keeping me interested. I only watched it because I was hoping it would be like the first one where 007 meets The Punisher:) It is one of those movies made for the sake of being made, boring story, cliché characters, mindless action, things done just for the sake of being done. Sure watch it with a bunch of friends and have a laugh at how bad it is.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
109,dinalt10,Utterly lame,4,21 January 2017,"I have to admit that xXx is one of my guilty pleasures, as is xXx The Next Level. Both Vin Diesel and Ice Cube fitted their roles perfectly, and each had at least reasonable scripts and great action scenes.Fast forward to this installment, and it seemingly tries hard to emulate the Fast & Furious franchise. And that's where the entire plot starts to fail. xXx (whether Diesel or Cube) was a lone wolf. He didn't need a team, many of whom are instantly forgettable.And while there were memorable scenes from both previous xXx films, they're sadly lacking in this outing. After getting home from the cinema, I dusted off my old xXx DVD, and it was like night and day. This installment makes the first 2 look like masterpieces.I was really looking forward to this film. But it's a massive let down.As with 'Riddick', Diesels character has been changed to be gods gift to women. Hence a pointless scene in London where he beds about 6 or 7 women, and a gushing OTT scene with Nina Dobrevs character.Guess the main problem is there's no real villain throughout. Turns out most characters are in the xXx program, and the 'villain' is big government. Problem with that is, the script (and most of the cast) aren't strong enough to carry the film.Unless they get back to grass roots, e.g. just Vin Diesel or Ice Cube (maybe both), then I hope there isn't a 4th installment.Save your money for a better film is my recommendation.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
110,oazam,Deepika Padukone's punches couldn't save the film. Absolute waste of my time,5,22 January 2017,"I was eagerly excited for Deepika to enter Hollywood. The behind the scenes photos looked nice and I really liked her figure with the tattoos and etc. The first 2 XXX films were downright pathetic although the action sequences are edgy but this one managed to follow the same pattern as for the first 2 movies. The trailer looked nice thinking that this was something worth waiting for especially when an actor like Vin Diesel comes into the spotlight but to be honest, this film is undoubtedly one of the most clichéd action films I've ever seen in my life.The acting was very average and no actor or actress really stranded out at such. Vin Diesel gave a performance that was slightly better than Riddick and The Last Witch Hunter. Deepika Padukone performed very decent and she started off well. Samuel L. Jackson is better off finishing the Avengers series and then retire. Please anyone tell him to do that if possible. The other actors like Donnie Yen and Tony Jaa weren't great in their roles despite kicking butts. The action scenes were choreographed consistently just like the jet ski scene which was shot with good aesthetic sense. The fighting scenes were also shot beautifully but the way the film was shot didn't surprise. The VFX was absolutely average almost brings me back to the time the VFX in Suicide Squad made me cringe a lot. The way the cities were shown in the movie was like watching a T-series (bollywood) music video with poor editing such as cartoon based skies. The background score was also terrible that made the flow of the film very choppy and haphazard.I think that Deepika Padukone should stick with Bollywood and use some sense when it comes to accepting underwhelming scripts otherwise things will get ugly.Overall, XXX 3 is undoubtedly one of the most disappointing movies of this year and honestly no one is really going to spend cash just to see deepika pack a couple of punches because people have other things to do in life rather than watching a generic film. This movie definitely worth watching but on a TV Broadcast. Vin Diesel, better satisfy me with Fast and Furious 8 because I didn't like the trailer.2/5- 2017 on the verge of unsuccessful films even after OK Jaanu (Bollywood film).",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

Boy was a wrong, what we got was 2 explosions, stunts that should not be in any movie because they are not possible by any shape or means in real life, and a story that was far worse than i originally expected. The acting and script were really bad to boot.I guess they took the Michael Bay philosophy, i.e. who needs story and script when you can dazzle them with action and stunts, but you really cant.I cannot make up my mind if most of America is really dumb in liking this stuff, or they just manage to switch off their intelligent part of their brain when they do, i seem to be unable to switch off however.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

Well, the action was good, somewhat. But most of the film was a drag.It's hard to explain why. It starts off pretty well, actually, setting the stage for what is to follow. But it goes downhill afterwards. It's hard to connect with any of the characters because they are all so artificial. Note that I don't care much for realism. But if you're going to bend reality, at least make it somewhat plausible.What they ended up creating is a movie with virtually no emotion whatsoever, it's hard to understand the motivations behind any of the characters, and one keeps waiting for the next action scene, because most dialogues are just plain boring. And Vin Diesel, by the way, delivers very little on that front. Donnie Yen does a much better job, it was good watching his fight scenes, can't wait for him to have his own US movie.Besides Donnie Yen's contribution, the women are beautiful, and there a couple of funny moments. Those things made the movie bearable and sometimes entertaining, which for me means a 5-6. But yeah, don't bother watching this at the cinema like I did.

The ""Hollywood"" essence is just not there. Some action scenes are just too plain and do not make any sense. Some other parts of the movie are filled with disconnected dialogues. It's like they just met each other for the first time in their life time. You can't feel their personality and you can't relate to them at all.It's just a shame for the triple X franchise.

I got so tired of watching her roll her eyes and act all the way through with the ""plaeeeeeeeessseee"" attitude. Terrible terrible. Then there's Vin. There have been some movies I have liked the dude in but too often he comes across as an overacting dick. This was one of those. Lots of action in the movie if you like chewing a lot of bubble gum and blowing a lot of bubbles. Not much depth. And of course they had to have Samuel ""what's in your wallet"" Jackson to make an appearance for the ""Star"" factor. Probably all he did for this flick was talk some actors into switching credit cards. Nina ""vampire dairies"" Dobrev appeared cause I guess she had no place else to go.

This move made Machete look like The Shawshank Redmemption. The CGI was mind-numbing and the vapid smug lines from that half-wit, Ruby Rose just added insult to injury. Now you'd think high impact explosions and action could usually tone down a terribly- written storyline, but this movie proves that the impossible is possible. Instead of some decent action like the Mechanic, this movie leaves you with scenes such as a guy kicking a serviette dispenser into a thief's head and knocking him out cold, Vin Diesel sleeping with 6 models and coming out smirking, and Ruby Rose in-cased in a suspended sleeping bag from a palm tree whilst 500 people walking around are oblivious to the ultra white cotton.

120,nandidot,"Fun, Ass-Kicking, Popcorn Flick",7,23 January 2017,"Did I watch 'xXx: Return of Xander Cage' for Deepika Padukone? Guilty. But I also watched it because I've since its predecessor and enjoy a good old-fashioned action film that caters to adrenaline junkies. xXx2 has the same done to death plot as most action movies- baddies steal a weapon that can destroy the world and our team of unlikely heroes has to save it. Nothing new at all in the story department but the movie is fun. It was, as they say, a popcorn flick that's meant to be forgotten as soon as you walk out of the theatre.Vin Diesel returns as Xander Cage 15 years after he first portrayed the character and he's pretty much the same as he was then, albeit his charisma, box-office draw, and number of fans has grown exponentially. Mr. Diesel isn't really an actor; he's a star who flexes his muscles and flies off of buildings as the crowd laughs and asks for more. Pushing 50, I'm not sure how much longer he'll be able to do this but for now I enjoy a good plane jump and bad guy bashing.The movie is filled with a multitude of quirky characters. A few who left a mark were Donnie Yen as the kung-fu master, Ruby Rose as Xander's sharpshooter buddy, and Nina Dobrev who adorably plays the bubbly techie who can't shut up. They make a highly unrealistic team but who cares.And now we get to Ms. Padukone. Having conquered Bollywood, Deepika enters the global scene with a bang. She couldn't have asked for a better commercial debut as she charms her way through a role she could do in her sleep. She flashes her smile and our hero melts and she kicks ass like the best of them. I read a couple of reviews of this movie written by critics I admire and they came across as Deepika fanboys/girls who raved about the movie for the sole reason that she was in it. I rolled my eyes but I agree. It's great to see our (yes, I will take ownership) girl shine.I will reiterate that the movie is nothing new or award worthy. It's hardly creative and I doubt we'll be talking about it again until the inevitable sequel comes out but if you want to spend a couple of hours watching people do the unbelievable and are a Diesel or Padukone fan you won't really be disappointed.

Otherwise tolerable scenes completely lose immersion every time this ""actress"" tries acting. I can't express strongly enough how much she dragged the movie downHer speech is cardboard, her body language is cardboard, her stunts are cardboard, her ability is soggy soggy cardboard BUT Hollywood once again makes sure the Indian is the only completely good person, the Indian is the only one with integrity, the Indian is the most skilled, the Indian is the most sexy:She wants to save the world while her partner wants to destroy it.In a room full of IT experts, she is the only one who knows how to track tech, while all white people are incompetent.

But I wouldn't pay box office price and support the propaganda.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
124,lev-nemkin,Quite enjoyable...,6,11 March 2017,"I actually enjoyed this more than I thought I would this had some great action and stunts also Vin Diesel never disappoints in my opinion whatever the movie in this he returns as Xander Cage one of his best characters in my opinion this is the kind of movie where you just need to switch off your brain and have fun with that's exactly what I did I wasn't expecting Oscar worthy performances or even a perfect movie in fact had no expectations going in whatsoever and I enjoyed it for what it was these kinds of movies are not to be taken seriously I thought the acting was quite good and the fight scenes were awesome I really don't get why a lot of people hate on this movie it's a good sequel to the first Vin Diesel xXx movie now I didn't care so much for State of The Union which was the one with Ice Cube by the way his character Darius Stone makes an appearance at this in some point and it's pretty cool I have nothing against him as an actor or this character he's awesome it's just that movie itself. Anyway back to this I also came across a complaint that Tony Jaa's role in this was too small I didn't think so he was in it pretty much all the way through and he was great so was Donnie Yen. To anyone who hasn't seen this but wants to when you do my advice is go in with no expectations,switch your brain off and just enjoy the action because it surely is a lot of fun I give it a 6/10 the action,stunts and fight scenes were very well done and so was the acting I also liked what they did with Gibbons that's Samuel L. Jackson's character but I'm sure anyone who's seen these movies would know that you also don't really need to see the first xXx to see this one I mean I've seen it but it was a really long time ago and I only vaguely remembered it but still understood what was going on in this one.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

Cast some of the biggest stars in the industry and you are halfway through, add a lot of mindless action, do some promotional stunts (like Vin wearing a Lungi and dancing on a Hindi song) and you are done. Audiences are bound to go crazy.I have never been a fan of any of the XXX films but this one I watched for Deepika. But Oh My God, what was I thinking? This film is awful beyond measure. There is nothing to watch. I mean it's the same thing you must have seen at least a hundred times by now. Same clichéd story, same mindless action sequences and people reading their lines like they are mannequins who have been brought to life my some magic. Even the origami did a way better job in Kubo and the two strings and they are made out of paper, mind you.People are saying Deepika was good and I completely disagree. I can say that she did a good job with action sequences but her acting was pathetic. In fact there were only one or two people who actually tried to act.So, don't waste your money on this awful experience. If you are watching it for Deepika then drop your plans. The screen time she gets is longer than I anticipated but nothing good comes out of it. It is another of those meaningless action films that you forget the moment you walk out of the Cinema. There are better movies playing in theaters that deserve your money instead of this crap. Do something meaningful with your money.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

It was entertaining enough however there wasn't much of a story and no character development. It felt like a inferior clone of the fast and furious franchise, Vin Diesel basically plays the same character but without the family feel of the team that fast and furious has. The supporting characters didn't have as much screen time as i would have liked which might have made the movie better as this was pretty much the Vin Diesel show. Toni Colette's character and acting was horrible and i feel she was a very bad miscast as i do usually like her acting. I would have preferred to have seen more of Nina Dobrev's character as she was actually a bit interesting and comedic. The stunts were unrealistic but that is to be expected in today's action movies. It's an OK movie but should have been a lot better as the original XXX i quite enjoyed but i found myself almost bored in parts of this. If you are into action movies its still worth watching but just don't go in expecting it to be great. I give it a 5/10.

It's 2 hour non-stop hip-hop music ans typical Go Pro videos you can see on YouTube for free. There is no story-line, no acting, no good action scenes, no spirit. I don't know who wrote the screenplay, but with lines like ""I have always had my eyes on the king"" ... ""Yeah, that's the problem, because you forgot the queen"" (and I was thinking those lines might be related to the story, but no, not at all) ... I mean, if this supposed to be a comedy, I can't help burst into laughing. A high school senior will write something better than this. The movie reminds me of the 2015 reboot of Point Break, same style, same bad movie, but at least with Teresa Palmer in swimsuit. I expected more from D.J.

Extreme sports, meets action film.I just kept hoping Tom Cruise would show up to save us viewers from this bad cartoon of a film. Sadly that didn't happen.Gorgeous cast. Ruby Rose and Deepika Padukone stole the show as far as I'm concerned, but don't go see this film just to see them. Even if you are a hardcore fan. I'm a big time fan of Donnie Yen and even though he was his usual great self, it didn't stop the pain and agony this film caused my senses. At least with a comic book film you already suspend belief. Even for human characters that have no superpowers what-so-ever. You still understand there will be outrageous stunts and CGI. I can't grasp why Vin Diesel does films like this. He doesn't do his own stunts the way that Tom Cruise does and Diesel looks over the hill.This film did the right thing by hiring actors like UFC champion Michael ""The Count"" Bisping and Tony Jaa who can actually fight, but sadly drowned them in poor writing and special effects.

130,SangamYadagiri,"Welcome back, Xander!",7,29 January 2017,"I remember watching the first XXX movie back in 2002 with my mouth wide-open enjoying the jaw-dropping action sequences. That was my first Vin's movie and I instantly liked him. Almost 15 years later, Xander returns with a triple bang (though there is an insignificant sequel called State of the Union).Though it is the return of Vin Diesel's character Xander Cage, it's Deepika Padukone as Serena who steals the show all the way. She was given the best lines and actions sequence as opposed to other lady actors in the movie. I would have to confess that her screen presence makes the movie eyes-full. What else to say? - The action is hardcore and mind blowing, the punch dialogues are very catchy and blah blah blah.The concept is kinda old wine is a new bottle. Movie starts off with a hilarious scene of Samuel L Jackson explaining an X-replacement recruit /trainee on how to save the world and stuff then suddenly boom - a satellite crashes on to earth and blasts off the coffee shop where these two guys are having a nice conversation. The re-introduction of Xander with an awesome action scene followed by another kick-off introduction scene of Deepika's set the right level of expectations for the movie ahead. Back to back bombastic scenes flood the screen leaving the audiences (like me) breathless not to mention the legendary dialogue like ""I live for this $#!+"" & ""X takes care of his own"" are bound to cause goosebumps. Final cameo by Ice Cube was awesome. There is an overdose of adrenaline rush in this movie but I liked the overdose. Above all these emotions, it's the nostalgia of the first XXX that dominates.Overall, it's a feast for action movie lovers!",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

Toni Collette in particular turns in an excruciatingly camp performance composed of struts, pouts and the occasional eye brow arch. She at least should know better! Diesel is pleasant enough as Xander but insufficient to overcome the tirade of tired cliches, lacking anything close to suspense.

My conclusion after this rush of elitism, adrenaline pumping and techno-thriller defile: ""James Bond Spec-Ops Action for the Generation Y""! There's even an actual global privacy paranoia driven plot beneath a very thin story-line/dramatization. Not to mention how today's ""n++"" followups look all the same. Guess the main substance is mind-blowing action (assuming a good production cost for the stunts and expansive explosions) Now, for the funny part. Imagine today's 'Roger Moore (I)' (qv) the early James Bond as muscled masculine type with hipster taste (and well... appearance), surrounded by other extreme wanna-be-different characters. Bond-girls wear tiger bikinis with say feathers and nasty tattoos and are armed with AI smartphones and laser Desert Eagles or SMGs. According to the zeitgeist, 90% of the movie is a techno action rush or exclusive parties or exotic sets, where acting as a virtue disappears, alongside with other cinematography qualities.If one can, he should speedup the dialog/story scenes for the sake of boredom, and slowdown the action ones, just to get any sense of what's going on (""How did he do that?!"" or ""What just happened?""). Bad balance of those aspects in this movie. As an action lover I'll stick to the ones with more ""brain"" and drama into it like Equiliser, Batmen or Matrix, I dunno... and leave this as a teenage fun.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

Vin Diesel was brought in to revive the ""X"" franchise. Yes, the script prefers a single 'x' instead of triple-x.Once again Xander Cage (did you really believe he can be killed?) is called upon to save the world, this time by retrieving a prototype device that can destabilise and crash satellites into populated areas from another extreme teamThis he does only this time instead of acting alone in true 'XXX' style, he puts together a team to locate and tackle the other team. Sound familiar? Fast & Furious, Guardians of the Galaxy?On being betrayed and discovering who the real enemy is, the two teams join up in a struggle against the odds amongst an endless stream of chases, more chases, crashes, bikini clad women and gunfights.The stunts are impressive, the CGI passable (motorbike surfing, really?) and the action brisk. Fans of Donnie Yen will be happy to see him and and with more English dialogue than all his previous movies put together and that includes 'Shanghai Noon' with Jacky Chan. Throw in Tony Jaa, another chopsocky star and the film gets a huge tick for the Asian box office.The bevy of beauties led by the gorgeous Deepika Padukone adds the Indian box office plus ticket sales from every male with a pulse over the PG13. Ka-ching!!!One would think that with so many bases covered, so much action and breath-taking stunts and SFX the film must be enjoyable. Well yes and no.Dining on the best smorgasboard is great but can still leave a bitter taste in your mouth if you have a lousy date and this carefully crafted action flick is for all it's heroics, hard to swallow.The dialogue is poor, the acting non-existent even from a veteran like Toni Collette, the plot formulaic and the conclusion anti-climatic.I might watch this again but probably with the audio off while I'm reading a good book.I have no doubt Vin will be laughing all the way to the bank, not that he needs it, mostly from international screenings. Escapism is good and the viewer should suspend all reason and logic to enjoy this. For me, in the words from another Vin Diesel series, this latest offering will either ""convert or kill"" the ""xXx"" franchise.

137,darryl-42069,"The movie that is the insane, the crazy, and the enjoyable",8,21 January 2017,"DISCLAIMER: I haven't seen the first movie, but did watch the second movie.Who doesn't love the VIN-TASTIC Vin Diesel. From Fast and Furious, to Riddick, Vin Diesel became a household name for action movies in these recent years. Most of Vin Diesel's movies are great, and this was no exception.The plot follows Xander Cage, long thought to be dead, was brought back in action as he and his group tries to retrieve the Pandora's Box, a dangerous device that can take down any satellites in the world. From the very first scene, you know this would be a wild adventure filled with insane action and one liners. The characters are great and all were memorable. Vin Diesel is back as the great Xander Cage, and basically he's good at everything. Donnie Yen is also great as Xiang. Deepika Padukone, the currently number one actress in India is also memorable as the female lead. Others such as Ruby Rose, Kris Wu (Yes, it's former member of EXO, Kris!),Tony Jaa (It's a surprise, I don't know he's also in this movie!), Nina Dobrev, and many others are also memorable. Although appearing for a short time, Hermione Corfield, the 90th Most Beautiful Face in 2016 (If you know TC Candler's list, then you know what I'm talking about) makes a well done performance as well. Sam L. Jackson, as always gave a great performance though I want to see more of him. Also, a shout-out for one great cameo from Neymar Jr. himself. Ice Cube also makes a surprise appearance as Darius Stone, the Triple X from xXx: The Next Level/State of the Union, making the second movie not so neglected. The action is some of the most insane stunts I've seen. There was also a few funny bits in the movie, making the movie not so serious.Even with an all star cast, a great load of action, and a few good jokes, there were some issues. One, the first part of the movie has some uncomfortable scene, which, as the name implies, makes me uncomfortable. Two, There were some plot holes in the movie, like: *SPOILER ALERT* HOW THE HECK SAM L. JACKSON AND NEYMAR STILL ALIVE AFTER BEING HIT BY A FALLING SATELLITE + EXPLOSION?!. *END OF SPOILER* Three, some of the CGI's are clearly noticeable. And four, is the writers running out of ideas? I mean it's okay having this movie a few twists and turns, but *SPOILER ALERT* making the government a bad guy is an idea gone old. The last stunt is clearly a rip-off from Uncharted 3 (DISCLAIMER: I don't play any of the Uncharted main series, I know it because I see the playthroughs). And making Sam L. Jackson fake his own death? Again? He's done it already in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, why he had to do it again? *END OF SPOILER*Even with all the issues in the movie, the good has overcome the bad.

In my opinion was even better than the first part from 2002. Acting maybe was not the best but that was not important, you feel like inside the computer game and that's what is all about. Don't understand people complains about it- the story was very simple but clear- honestly does not deserve all the criticism. Recommended!!!

Now I don't work at NASA or Space-X and I don't have a degree in aerospace engineering, but I am pretty sure you cannot guide a satellite through re-entry to a pinpoint location on the Earth. Even if you could, it's not like it would be a hydrogen bomb like this movie portrays. It would disintegrate and land all over the map in pieces. But no, it gets sent to earth like it's being fired from a rail gun. The orbital decay would take forever even with assistance. Then you have the stunt where Xander has jumped, sans parachute (because parachutes are for wimps) from a plane that he was able to get positive thrust to weight ratio on (basically a C5 sized plane full of cargo and electronics) to accurately intercept a falling satellite and yet was still able to run out of the plane somehow and freefall, and somehow catch up with a cargo container of which had a fouled chute. He freed the chute just seconds before it hit the ground, and it created an explosion, yet out he walks like a boss. Then of course Ice Cube has pinpoint accuracy with a grenade launcher with grenades that have a very small blast radius.Rewind back to the highway battle where Donnie and Xander are fighting and suddenly the guy who jumped 200 meters (distance between buildings IRL)through a glass ceiling, and took out a room full of spec ops guys with ease, has trouble fighting an old broken down Xander Cage. This is the same Donnie Yen who couldn't be shot by a dozen security specialists in a small room but could be shot by one old woman who he knew full well was pointing a gun at him. The bad guy... wait, what? Who was he? Did it matter? The beach/island where the super duper secret assassins go seems to be in South Beach Miami, all the bars and live music and such.. and so hard for them to find. What was the crazy guy's role, to crash a car? Really?I almost vomited in my mouth when Vin kissed the Indian girl. He's like old enough to be her grandpa. So now you can drop a fully automatic weapon and it just discharges a full magazine and doesn't even spin around? So you can rip out a high voltage electrical conduit and plug it into a device to power it up, like it's a USB phone charger?So motorcycle tires have enough tread to act as propellers? Wouldn't it have been easier to just have wet bikes?So a motorcycle with a combustion engine and normal intake can run underwater?So a group of Delta Force soldiers can be hooked up to a cargo block without any of them knowing it, while Xander is walking around them?So you can jump from 100+ feet to the ground and as long as you have skis you'll be OK?So 3rd world countries have skateboards that use bearings that can survive 50mph rides down winding paved roads? So they have an airplane that can circle the globe x number of times without needing to refuel but they land it every few minutes?So somehow a mechanical device that attaches to your forearm increases the strength in your upper arm and chest to create stronger punches?So a 90lb woman can scale a tree with a 20lb sniper rifle and hold it steady with her off hand for 30 minutes while using the scope to watch the crowd, as she's hanging by sheets from the tree?What was up with DJ guy?

Diesel trying to look fast and agile while being an overweight badly aging walking ballsack is just laughable. And to boost his ego he had to include a group orgy scene with himself, disgusting. I wonder how much were the actresses paid to make out with him. Another particularly annoying actress in my opinion was the Indian woman, who could not act for sh*t (more so than the others) and had a very repulsive accent. The whole flick looks like some sort of a dreadful mix between an early 2000's direct-to-DVD B movie and some Bollywood circus. Kind of like Fast & Furious but even more stupid (which I didn't think was humanly possible) and with a smaller budget.The only two reasons why this is not a 1/10 are Ice Cube's cameo with his own ""Thank God"" playing in the background, and the presence of Nina Dobrev, who is almost too adorable.

Certain movies go a little to far fetch, but lord have mercy this was just a big pile of awfulness.Story - Stupid and again the same ole we must stop the technology before the evil villains use it to do damage. Not only was it boring but I just could not believe any of it, even for laughs.Characters - Vin Diesel seemed to be out of it. He definitely wasn't even trying. Most of the lines he had were stupid and cringe worthy. Most of the characters shouldn't have even been there. DJ guy? Stupid. Crash driver? Why? Between horrible acting and dialogues most of the bad guys(the one shooting the good guys with guns) was like they went to Stormtroopers for aiming lessons. No lie, if you watch closely this guys are directly pointing at our heroes just for the bullets to be hitting the ground/dirt. Action and fight scenes even with Donnie Yen I could not enjoy.Action - Most of this movie has action. But almost every scene is like watching stuff anyone could come to the conclusion that the stuff shown would never work. Some examples I mean is falling from a high distance to perfectly land and go skiing. Nope. Or riding a dirt bike into water that turns into a jet ski of sorts and go under water and still work. Nope. Jumping off a freeway overpass onto another road to perfectly time and land on a semi-truck without knowing it would be there, twice. NOPE! I can watch movies for ridiculous far out moments. But this movie was just awful.In conclusion - The first xXx with Vin Diesel was fun to watch and enjoy. This movie butchered every aspect of it. Between crappy characters that were pointless, Vin Diesel being old and not caring, to a story/plot that a first grader probably wrote, lame music, Vin Diesel getting all the ladies <- stupid, and etc. I could go on about almost any scene.

The action is so incredibly over the top it's laughable. Some of the jokes seemed forced and unnatural. It has clichés up the wazoo. Was this movie meant to be a spy spoof? I've never heard of DJ Caruso (Director) but looking at his list of directing credits which includes episodes of Dark Angel and Smallville as well as the movie I Am Number 4 and the upcoming G.I. Joe 3 and you can see why this movie looks like a cross between Marvel's Agents of Shield, Kingsman The Secret Service and Spy Kids. Lots of explosions and plenty of action made this a fun way to waste some time but I probably wont watch it again. Cheers",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
152,aniseprakash,XXX returns with style but is it what expected?,7,14 January 2017,"Vin Diesel shines as Xander Cage. Whatever franchise Diesel is added to will be a crowd puller. XXX is no different, the action sequences are tailor made for Diesel. He looks stylish and performs his role with ease. As usual he is in almost every frame which is a huge plus.Deepika Padukone as Serena Unger will bring in whistles from the Indian-Subcontinent. She is fast as Diesel and being an agent she holds on to the role perfectly. Her confidence attire plants her in the audience minds. The only side-line would be her forced American accent to match the Hollywood standards which is too much to ask from an Indian origin. But she does manages it to an extent.The cast selection worked up to a mark. Donnie Yen as Xiang was OK for the role. His phase in the action scenes are delight, probably the next one for Jackie. But lags to impress as an antagonist. Other cast are less appealing as the whole movie travels behind Vin Diesel.The previous versions of the same franchise has done enough rule breaking and new dimension in action sequences. So it would be difficult to bring in inventions but the movie manages to pull it. The Satellite crashing scene, zero-gravity fight in the air are well thought but less impressive (Already watched it in few flicks like Inception).For an action lover the film is a must watch, particularly for Vin Diesel (Off course Deepika).

162,dgranger,Great stunts and action in a pretty forgettable film.,4,3 February 2017,"As the title says, this film has great stunts and action. But what this film doesn't have is a story or any dramatic tension at all. The film only served as an excuse to go from one over-the-top action scene to another using a cliché ridden ridiculous and unbelievable plot. What story there was in it was this: There is a weapon called Pandora's box that can make satellites fall out of the sky and kill people at will. The original prototype was used to kill Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) who is sitting in a cafe and trying to recruit a new spy. (Yes, that is just the first of the many unbelievable clinches used in this film - wiping out a whole town, killing everybody, by dropping a satellite on it right on the cafe where he is at, (wow, what remarkable aiming and knowledge of where he is), and he survives it while everyone else in town gets killed), while the realistic cheaper means of sending a professional agent/hit-man/assassin to kill Gibbons is never thought of or used). Then a team of highly trained stuntmen breach into a secure government building where a secret meeting high level is taking place and where someone was stupid enough to bring a new and improved version of Pandora's box to the meeting instead locking up that sucker in a secure vault somewhere. The device is stolen and everyone at the meeting is murdered, except for two people. Naturally one is a traitor and was in on the whole thing. And because the thieve showed that they where trained in extreme sports moves, there was no other man in the government similarly trained except Xander Cage and the government needs to bring him back from the dead (or really out of hiding). This where we get introduced to another of the film's clichés: the irrational snarling man (usually the government agent) that serves no other purpose other than go throughout the whole picture snarling at Cage and throwing insults and only ending as another obstacle Cage has to beat at the end. Naturally Cage recruits his own team of Triple xXx outsides and former Triple xXx agents in order to get the other guys. By the time Cage's finally recovers the stolen box, they find out that the other guys where also former Triple xXx agents too and they were trying save the world from the evil government. Wow! Another over used cliché:big government = evil, self serving egotistical anti-social rebels - good! When Cage returns the box to his superior, the government betrays him and his team and he has to get them in order to retrieve the box so that no-one can have the power to use it. That is the whole story. There is no dept to the characters at all except one: Adele Wolff who does some pretty cool stunts in her scenes. What this series needs to do is to go back to the original premise of the first one: there are some areas of the world and society that gentlemen agents like James Bond can't walk into and would get spotted right off while Cage can - aka: the anti-Bond world. And start with a solid story built realistically and logically from there to the wild. The original xXx showed that there is a whole section of the wealthy society that does the grunge thing and are not the type that would visit the casinos and nightclubs that Bond would go to. My advice is to save your money and wait for the video or cable showing of it.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

Second, good stunts. Third, no thinking required.Moving on to the bad and the ugly. The plot is just pathetic. The characters are superficial and uninteresting. I am a die hard Die Hard fan and, honestly, watching this felt like dying hard with cancer inside a bombed middle eastern hospital. Who were all these people? Nina Dobrev's acting was so bad that I needed to talk to a doctor after the credits. I seriously wanted to ask if there was a doctor in the theater. The editors could have easily taken out all scenes with her and no one would have noticed. I am waiting for a DVD release without her. Deepika Padukone looks amazing but her skills on the set were just not present. Michael Bisping? Really? Vin Diesel. It's always good to have Vin Diesel in a movie except not in this particular movie. Riddick stories were good, Fast and Furious franchise is good (the first parts), Knockaround Guys was really good... All right, watch this movie on cable.

In what is essentially a love letter from Vin Diesel to himself, the acting here varies from wooden, to pretty terrible, to downright insane (to paraphrase the film's titular hero, Xander Cage, upon meeting his 'crew'). Whilst Toni Collette and Sam Jackson compete for the role of person whom can appear most disinterested in the film; screen newbies such as Neymar jnr. and Michael Bisping – whose respective appearances really put into perspective the acting chops of the likes of LeBron James and John Cena (both also sports stars who have made a much smoother transition to the big screen) – serve only to cynically enhance the movies' power to reach as wide an audience as possible. On a positive note, Ruby Rose's character proves to steal each scene she appears in; providing a layered, nuanced performance as brooding, badass, eco-warrior(?), sniper, Adele Wolff.All that being said, xXx3 is a lot of fun for what it is: that being a mindless, shoot-em-up, video game inter-spliced with post-production editing in of quippy lines and smash-you-over-the-head-with-a-mallet-innuendo. Ultimately, if you can accept the film's core premise of: extreme sports nut, LGBT community member, a DJ and Murdoch from the A-Team (the 2014 version), belittle the U.S. Army and save the world from falling satellites; you'll probably enjoy this film as much as I did!",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

168,markcalway,Too much,3,15 March 2017,"49 year old action hero and skateboarding Vin Diesel is back as XXX.That alone should give you some concerns. While the first film had a certain style this one appears to be written by a 14 year old boy. Everything is action and babes, they can't do anything without it being OTT. While Vin Diesel was very good in the first one, they have done what Transformers franchise, which was go all CGI and action to mask a lack of character strengths, acting and plot.The action sequences are too far fetched. I don't want to pick on Vin Diesel because virtually ever character in this film is cartoon like and laughable. There is no risk of anyone getting hurt, despite all the 30 to 1 odds, guns and explosions. The characters can simply avoid everything and yet hit with every shot even though they are twirling around and falling off stuff. Take the first 15 minutes and be warned. Killing people with Satellites, skiing where there is no snow, skateboarding and a Neymar Jr cameo. Most disappointing as you know that regardless of whatever threat there is, the plot really doesn't do anything substantial. There is no depth, there are simply bad guys who are going down. It seems as though the writers simply bought as much ammo and explosives as they could and even when you think its safe to leave the cinema, they add a predictable brainless twist, not because it makes sense, but solely because they still had a tonne of explosives and ammo left over and needed some way of using it all up.So if you are an adolescent boy and you want guns, explosions, babes, CGI, skateboarding, stunts and lots of fighting it'll no doubt be a 10.

From this point is really only gets worse, so many times I cringed so hard then laughed.I found so many of the action scenes to be comical and so did many others in the cinema I was in. Vin Diesel was so awful he provided most of the unintentional comedy. Donnie Yen was brilliant in this and is a real highlight. Loads of eye candy and beautiful woman and of course for the woman you get many shots of Vin's gun as he flexes them every change he gets. Many times throughout the movie they seemed to want to position this as another Fast and the Furious style franchise.

Nina Dobrev was tragic, either she is a terrible actress either she was too happy to play alongside with famous actors and couldn't stop giggle while being ridiculous either the director hated her and advised her to act in a way that would ensure that no one should hire her ever again.The accent of Serena could drill holes in your brain and almost turned the movie to a comedy. In Big Bang theory the accent was cute and funny...here just bad and cringe. Fighting? Bah, there were a lot of monkey jumping fighting scenes but nothing like a real fight. Some Asian actors would jump around, which was fun in the beginning, but the real fight never really started. I like watching Asian movies from time to time and i expect them to have Asian actors, Asian culture elements and Asian heroes...but when i watch xXx i expect to watch an American movie, not an Asian one...the ill matched elements were tiresome and out of place, plus they ruined the whole feeling of the movie. Next time please warn us, i would rather watch a Korean movie rather than such a monstrosity....

It's just over the top and 2 hours of macho-fest for Vin Diesel. I loved him in Riddick. The Furious movies were quite okay. At least I watched them in their entirety. This? No sir. I simply had to leave. Both me and my better half had to give up. She's normally quite fond of Diesel, but this was cringe-worthy scene upon another. No really redeeming features.

You can say that there is a special category of movies that exaggerates action movies, and this movie definitely belongs to this category.

The script feels rushed and incoherent. The basic premise is senseless and the way it is solved is pretty much equally senseless. Definitely, far below the first xXx.As an action movie it isn't bad, and has some decent scenes. I might have given it an extra star for Tony Jaa and Donnie Yen, but the movie only makes use of 1% of their talents.I would say this is on the level of the 2005 movie Doom, or slightly worse even.

Vin Diesel proves that natural science has no hold over Xander Cage (Vin Diesel), an NSA agent who was previously thought to be dead but is found and brought back out of hiding in order to save the world from falling satellites. Someone within the NSA stole a device known as Pandora's Box that controls every satellite orbiting Earth and uses it to cause them to fall one by one to Earth. The government is obviously freaking out about it. Xiang, played by Donnie Yen, and his gorgeous partner Serena, played by Deepika Padukone, are out to stop it from falling in government hands. Xander is caught between the NSA and the blacklisted agents and must choose who he trusts if he's going to obtain Pandora's Box before all the satellites are destroyed.The plot wasn't bad. It was actually very entertaining. One thing I loved about the film was that governmental wasteful spending was poked fun at numerous times. Jane, played by Toni Collette, was the agent that recruited Xander. At one point, Xander scoffs at the technology and says to Jane, ""No wonder America's in debt trillions of dollars. Do you really need all the gadgets to catch this guy?"" Jane replies by saying, ""Oh, we don't need them. But it makes the catching more fun."" I wonder just how true that statement is.The acting was much better than the previous films, however, there's still room for improvement. Donnie Yen was by far my favorite out of all of them. His martial arts were astounding. I'd love to see him face off with Jackie Chan sometime. The next best was Ruby Rose, who played super sniper Adele Wolff. She loved, lived, and breathed weaponry. Ruby was insanely badass and I can't wait to see her in her next two action films this year (Resident Evil: The Final Chapter and John Wick: Chapter 2). Last, but certainly not least, there's the bubbly and funny Nina Dobrev who took a complete 180 degree turn from her more serious role in The Vampire Diaries. She was an absolute delight and I look forward to seeing what she does next.Overall, I was more than impressed with the film. It wasn't perfect but at least it had a coherent plot unlike the other two. The action was impressive. There were some stunts that I had never seen before. There were times when you couldn't tell what was CGI and what was real which just added to the intensity and fun. The film gets a 3.5 out of 4.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

The USA News Media, The USA Movie Industry, etc REALLY needs to have the XXX Courage to do this ""XXX Julian ASSAGE (Wikileaks)!!"" movie. And at the END, I want to remember the producers, writers, that Jesus was the Religion of the Black Guys, Hunted and Kidnapped like Animals from Africa !!

190,fudanchu-725-268123,Nothing is possible,3,29 May 2017,"There is a trend of superhero films in which the superheroes are presented as more-or-less regular people but with remarkable skills, yet in fact their talents are more akin to Spiderman or Harry Potter. And in which the laws of physics are suspended entirely, except when they are needed for the plot (in fact, they were never needed in this film). And in which the villains are completely incompetent and merely serve as cannon fodder, giving the heroes a little something to liven up their day. And in which people survive catastrophes that would kill even ""normal"" superheroes, but without explanation. And in which technology is a nonsense plot device that has no link with any technology in existence. This is one of those films, perhaps the most extreme I have ever seen -- even outdoing Fate of the Furious in its absurdity. Did I hate it?

That's not true! The script/dialogue/""plot"" was low. So no matter how hard the actors try, it will never feel like they're doing something meaningful. This whole movie is overloaded with actors that are somewhat popular at the moment, which leads to not a single one having enough screen time to develop his/her character. The story is as generic and random as it gets. Oh yeah and political propaganda has to be in any movie nowadays it seems. Indian girl is the best in IT, best in shooting and she wants to ""change the world"" by eliminating 100 soldiers that are probably fathers and brothers, but okay I get it, they are ""evil"". There are like 500 stereotype cliché girls all over the place. 2 Girls are shooting by each others side to show us they have bonded now, but they are in the middle of a room without cover, when 20 marine soldiers have cover and somehow miss them the whole time. Its funny to see the producers want to show the two girls as 2 badass skilled women and using techniques from 20 years ago, which makes me not care about them anymore, because apparently they cannot be killed. Good job... Donnie Yen does nice close combat fights and ""good guy"" soldier will always come close enough to him to be able to perform, even though they had a loaded weapon and were in a safe distance to shoot before. None of those characters have human bodies, they cannot be killed by crashes, grenades, bullets, jumps ranging from 10-20 meter falls, being hit by cars fullspeed etc. Basically you are watching the avengers light version, without the cool characters and the better cgi and story... Phew. I had many impulses to stop watching and finally close to end I did leave, because it was too dumb. This is a movie for 12- 16 years old at the max. It probably sucked way worse because I watched John Wick 2 a week earlier which was superb..",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

The super power government can't take on some wanna-be hot shot so they bring in someone with literally zero combat training to save the world from destruction. A scrawny D.J. (Kris Wu), a next generation Angelina Jolie (Ruby Rose) in which Hollywood thinks we will buy into her 50kg ass- kicking abilities, a has been adrenaline junkie (Vin Diesel), some kinda fan service rave scene dancer/Maui Thai fighter (Tony Jaa), an invincible bullet dodging Donnie Yen, the rehashed burn out Sam Jackson that for some reason plays the exact same role in every movie he is in regardless of the script, and the absolute worst of them all O'Shea Jackson Sr. (because I can't stand his stupid self given ice cube name) which they thought he deserved to be called a Navy SEAL for the role of the movie with his ghetto gangster act crap.Some of the worse special effects I have seen since the 90's. Sam Jackson fakes his death just like in the marvel comics stuff, Vin Diesel gets recruited and can miraculously see through any and all ploys between global terrorist and the U.S. govt. Vin Diesel then refuses to take highly trained military troops into combat with him, instead the script writers make them look like nothing more than dim witted high school jocks. Vin Diesel recruits utter garbage for his team, see above about the scrawny D.J. and the forced female badass that is outweighed by a medium sized dog. I am sure there was more to this movie, but no matter how hard I tried not to, I couldn't seem to prevent myself from tuning it out. I think the highlight of the movie was watching Donnie Yen or Tony Jaa fight scenes. The rest of it was extremely unbearable. This movie needs to be hit with a heavy dose of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and let those guys rip it apart.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

They assembled a lot of big names from different industries, most of whom I am well acquainted with like deepika padukone - one of Bollywood's top actresses, Nina Dobrev from the Vampire diaries and Kris Wu, former member of the popular south Korean band Exo and last but not least, Vin Diesel, the driving force behind the smashing fast and furious trilogy. I was really excited for the movie and even a basic, simple story line with logical plot line and screenplay would have satisfied me but obviously the people behind this doesn't know that every good movie needs a coherent story, no matter how much action or CGI u pile up. The characters were one dimensional. You can forget them as soon as you heard their name. Vin diesel tries hard to bring his Dom mojo to work on this movie too but fails after a certain period of time. And let's not talk about the blatant objectification of women for no apparent reason. I only gave 5 stars because it brought a lot of my favorite actors and stars together and the action scenes which deserves to be credited.

The slight tilt of the head and cute smirk got old after the first 5 minutes. Donnie Yen's fight scenes were really good, and that's about the best this film brings. The writing was atrocious. The snarky, too-cute and cliché lines at every turn. I didn't know if I was watching a movie or reading the one-liner comebacks from a comedy show. It's too bad because this movie had a good cast. Toni Colette needs to stick to heavier roles; she looked out of place in this role. And more Samuel Jackson. I've been hoping for better films to come out of the new China-owned studios, but so many have disappointed lately. Maybe Jet Li could have saved this film, I'm not sure.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

204,aronsteel,No story line only action,7,30 August 2017,"This was the best among all of movies in the xXx franchise. There was a lot of action in it. And also the graphics and directing of the movie was good too. The only thing it was lacking a good script. Like all the previous movies in the franchise this one too lacked a good script. The only reason it was a good to watch was the actors and actresses playing their part right.I really would say Ruby Rose performed her role with great perfection.But i didn't like the Tony Jaa's and Michael Bisping's role at all in the Donnie Yen's team. I mean their role really was not that important or did anything that significant.Also Nina's nerdy look really didn't suited her at all. She was not looking that intelligent and her acting was a bit forced. She didn't knew what expressions she had to make when saying her lines. She didn't look her part at all. The old tech guy at least looked or acted like a techie in the previous movies. But she totally blew it. Even the part where she end up shooting for the first time was not played that good by her.The movie when it started looked like it would be a god movie and might be something good in store for us as it goes on. Also i liked the entrance scene of Donnie Yen, Deepika Padukon, Ruby rose, Kris Wu and Vin diesel. That part can be considered to be good. But the story went down the hill after the team were formed. There was nothing that significant in the story line other than all people shooting at each other. It is a good movie for you if you like to watch only shooting and action with no heads and tails of where the story is heading to but if you don't then it is not a movie for you.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
205,omiazad,Had lots of expectations but...,2,18 January 2017,"I am from South Asia so definitely I have a soft corner for South Asian/Indian artists. So went to watch the 1st day 1st show with my son in an IMAX theater of Singapore. As I was in town, did not want to miss the chance. The entire time I was waiting for the thrill to come, but unfortunately it kept me waiting. To be honest it was a disturbing presentation of a poor story. The direction was bad, timing was bad and moreover the director may have forgotten that the movie is not for the 90's audiences.Today we love to watch stories with some practicality in it. We want to believe fictions. But unfortunately everything is absent in this movie. Van Dissel is flirting with whatever women is coming on his way will not be welcome by many audiences. Even James Bond did not do that! :) We know Deepika Padukone is not Priyanka Chopra but we expected an unique chemistry in this movie. She is nether sexy, nor dangerous. Director may have wanted to present her as a hot+tough character, but in many places you will find her role missing. Director was not sure what to show when, like I have said before, very bad timing. End of the day, the entire responsibility came on Van Dissel and we all know one man cannot carry the entire movie. Even on IMAX, I found no connection between everything.The most horrible role has been played by Toni Collette. I think many would agree with me that she was disgusting.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

For movie itself there is nothing new - very Hollywood formulaic movie. Lot of effort to make any movie thus this movie modest 5. Not a big fan of action movie only went to see Deepika. Lot of action. Movie story is very predictable. Nina Dobrev is amazing geeky character. The only thing worth watching was Deepika however she could improve on her accent and Hollywood style acting which is little different.Deepika kiss with Vin Diesel is a hardly big thing and not worth as how much ho-ha is made in Bollywood for her kiss which was more or less like peck on cheek.

Do i think Vin cant act his way out of a wet paper bag or is it the directors direction that made me cringe every 3 mins? I think it was the crappy role, still like you Vin.This is one of those movies where all the ""good"" guys can shoot and kill every thing they nonchalantly point a gun at while doing acrobatics, yet ALL the ""bad"" guys couldn't hit the broadside of a barn standing 10 feet in front of it using a mini-gun and a truck load of ammunition! One more observation. EVERYONE in the movie looks like they just stepped off the stage of a GQ male model shoot or a Victoria secrets lingerie fashion show. Boring. Zero depth.Rating: 3 stars, 1 for each of the Asian guys and 1 for Deepok Shockra or whatever her name is, VERY beautiful. Hope to see her in more films.

219,dreamtakers,Explosive Popcorn Flick with Diverse Cast and Lots of Laughs,7,28 January 2017,"Vin Diesel is back in his old shoes once again as Xander Cage in the second installment of xXx: Return of Xander Cage. The last time Diesel appeared in a xXx show was over a decade ago - way back in 2002. The main question that is playing on everyone's minds since the trailer release: Can this new movie surpass the original?Xander Cage is basically a copy of Dominic Toretto. They are both adrenaline addicted thrill seekers who are recruited by the government to hunt down dangerous weapons stolen by a group of bad guys. Cage is enlisted by a ruthless official agent (Toni Colette) to retrieve Pandora's box, a mysterious device that is responsible for knocking satellites out of skies into populated areas, causing serious deaths and destructions. A huge assignment like this certainly cannot be achieved with a one-man show. Cage seeks out his old friends and forms his eccentric team: Adele Wolff (Ruby Rose), the crazy lesbian sniper, Tennyson Torch (Rory McCann), the outrageous driver and Nicks (Kris Wu), the cool music DJ. Although the crew is made up of different interesting pieces, they lack the personality and family bond as explored by Furious films. Action takes up most of the screen time, leaving little to no time for characters to develop. The stunts in this movie are over-the top and borderline insane; another similarity with the Furious series. Leaping across rooftops? Check. Dropping from the sky (sans parachute)? Check. Fighting in zero gravity? Check. My favourite scenes include Cage skiing down the hills of the jungle. You read that right. Skiing. Also, the motorcycle chase scene with Xiang takes a turn all of a sudden to a boat chase by sprouting jet skis. I whistled internally; it is impressive! In addition, the hot potato game with a grenade between Cage, Xiang and Serena is ridiculous but is definitely one of the most memorable scenes. Despite the solid action and fun, this movie still comes off weak with its predictable plot, underdeveloped characters, corny dialogues and dull acting. Vin Diesel isVin Diesel. He pulls of the action man persona with a pass, though this time around he smiles a lot because Cage is supposedly a cheeky character. Ruby Rose, Nina Dobrev and Toni Colette played their roles to perfection. Donnie Yen's fights (especially his lightning fast iron fists) are magnificent as always, but his acting is stiff. Deepika Podukone, who plays his partner, did a decent job. She also lacked chemistry with Diesel's character so the final scene came off as slightly awkward. xXx: Return of Xander Cage is a movie that has no intention to be taken seriously. The film tries too hard to appear lighthearted with cheesy one-liners thrown out by almost every character, which gets overbearing as the show drags on. There are also funny cameos by Ice Cube (Darius Stone, xXx: State of the Union) and Neymar Jr, the hot, up-and- coming Brazilian footballer. This is the perfect movie for audiences who likes mindless shoot/beat-em-up. Action stunts of every pattern dominate the scenes, and the plot is cliché and overdone like most modern action movies. All in all, this film is a good comic and stress relief, but ultimately, nothing special worth remembering.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

Only to realize many bad reviews where fake..what they said did not even happen in the movie, many Vin Diesel haters putting 1 star ratings to drag the scores down.I will keep this spoiler free.The movie is action-packed from start to end, an incredible action scene happens within the first 10 minutes. The dialogues was also really funny, and my whole cinema roared with laughter several times. It is definitely a good popcorn entertainment, just like the Fast & Furious series. Donnie Yen stole the movie with his role, his screen presence is extraordinary, and audience cannot wait for the next scene with him. His acting is on point, his action scenes are so fast....that it is as fast as 8 years ago when he was in Ip Man/Flashpoint/SPL. It doesn't take much time before you start cheering for the villain - which is him. Deepika's accent was a little out of place, but her performance was okay. Of all the female characters, Nina Dobrev & Ruby Rose performed the best, and overshadowed Deepika. Just like how Donnie Yen overshadows Vin Diesel every time both of them were on screen together.Overall a good movie, with interesting dynamics and a story-line that does not have much flaw.It is better than the Expendables in my opinion.My only regret? I did not watch it in IMAX 3D so probably going to re-watch it.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
222,mukesh-loveisme,Superb entertainment for those who 'get it'!,9,18 March 2017,"I saw a lot of negative comments here. I am guessing those comments are coming from viewers who have forgotten the first XXX movie. When you grab your pop-corn and drink and sit in your seat in the movie hall for an XXX movie, you KNOW what you are going into.The theme is simple: Xander Cage does things that he HAS to do it his way: Like NO OTHER man on earth can! So he jumps from the plane without parachute, jumps from the bridge believing his fate and lands on vehicles, does stunts that nobody else would dream of. This is the theme of XXX movies and if you 'get it', you will get goosebumps and adrenaline pumps all through the movie. There is never a slow spot in the movie.It is all about action sequences where at many instances I was like ""Whoooaaaa!"" Performances: Donnie Yen: Bad-ass fist fights! Loved his performance! Ruby Rose: A CHARM. My favorite female character of the movie.Nina Dobrev: Cute and cutely-hot and she did well for her part.Deepika Padukone: I watched in Hindi where she dubbed it in her own original voice, so people who watched in English and didn't like her accent is understandable. Other than that, I think she did justice to her role.And Finally, Vin Diesel: I have been all negative about Vin Diesel, even in the Fast and Furious series coz I think he is a lazy kind of an actor. BUT, that Vin Diesel was completely absent from this movie. He is energetic, charismatic and 'lives up' to the challenge of presenting the character of Xander Cage with full justice.

Did it have action, yes, most of the action scenes were good, quite a few were unrealistic and far fetched, even for an adrenaline junkie like Xander Cage. Far too many cliché one liners, by almost every cast member.. It gets boring after a while, they did try to include humour in it, yet it didn't work. Michael Bisping was probably the funniest and if you're a fan of MMA or even UFC in particular, you'd know that's saying something.

229,sahilelastic,Substandard entertainer,5,18 January 2017,"If you want to enjoy this movie , leave your brains at home.As mindless and dull as the plot is , the film never ceases to entertain.It gives you the guilty pleasure you may have come to expect from the Xxx series even though it may be a step down from the 2002 blockbuster.Directed by DJ Caruso (Disturbia) the film is by no means a good film but because of a charismatic performance from Vin Diesel who seems to be having the time of his life, this film has some life in it. Deepika Padukone also gets her time in the spotlight and is quite enjoyable to watch alongside Diesel. Frankly speaking , the only ones who even have a real character arc along with Diesel are Deepika and Donnie Yen who packs quite a punch with some of his stunts. The rest of the characters however are reduced to stereotypes and some of them particularly Nina Dobrev's character get a little annoying at times.The cinematography is mostly shaky for the hand to hand combat and it gets tiring after a while and the stunts in the action sequences range between insane and ridiculous. There is a nice raw touch to the chase scenes.

Meaning that he should have pushed more effort into making this look good rather than leaving his beloved character prancing around in cgi environment.Don't get me wrong. The action is there and so is all the cheese that comes with these type of films. It's just that much of the ""blockbuster"" or rather ""cinema"" feel dies when you notice that most of the scenes are being filmed presumably inside a warehouse with green screens.A straight to rental movie I'd expect this from yes (a la The Mechanic 2), but not from a film with a known title running in theaters starring a leading man from another well pumping franchise. It feels rushed to say the least. It feels ""let's toss this together real quick and make a buck while we can"".Other than that, it is spot on with what you need a Saturday night in the couch with a bowl of popcorn.

I felt the Director was just copying the stunts from various James Bond movies and other Hollywood Action Blockbusters with a something of a story binding them together.Deepika's role and character was half baked but she was very impressive specially since this was a role that demanded physical commitment and she did good.Overall I felt Vin Diesel who was also the producer should have been more careful in choosing the subject.Other Actors like Samuel L Jackson,Ice Cube had blink U Miss Roles while Tony Jaa looked like a caricature of himself.Highly Disappointing and Avoidable movie until unless You want to see Deepika in a Big Ticket Hollywood Action Movie....",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

239,LostMonkeyBoy,Secondhand embarrassment to the Nth Degree,3,20 January 2017,"Paramount Pictures brings you the sequel to a movie you never wanted. The only people who will probably LOVE this movie are hardcore Vin Diesel fans, who feel he can do no wrong, and probably 14 year old boys who still enjoy dumb action movies. However, I will say that if you are able to suspend your disbelief, as I was after the first hour, you may end up sort of enjoying this movie for all its over-the-top action and lame acting. Especially if you like Donnie Yen - he was easily the best part of the entire movie. He was so good that I will actually look for his other movies to watch more of him. Now. onto the cold, hard truth of the matter: This movie is terrible. Who wants to see a try-hard 50 year-old man acting like an extreme sports nut, trying to ""get down with the kids"", with his obvious stunt-double and lame CGI stunts, with his jean shorts, and lame tattoos? Nobody, that's who! It's Secondhand embarrassment to the Nth degree.You wanna know who is a badass? Somebody who doesn't need to try hard - they just have 'it'. Do you know who isn't a badass in this movie? Vin Diesel/ Xander Cage. With every cheesy line he delivers with a smirk, you can just tell it was carefully crafted to just make the audience think ""wow, he's so cool"". The only problem is that it has the complete opposite effect. It's like seeing your embarrassing old uncle, who still thinks he's as cool as he was two decades ago, and a hit with the younger crowd. He's not, and neither is Vin Diesel - we just tolerate it because it's too embarrassing for us to say anything - well I'm saying it. It's so cringe-worthy and hard to watch. Stop it Vin Diesel, you were meant to be better than this! How could you regress so much in your acting that you look like you just started last year?You can tell that Vin Diesel (as the producer) and the studio were planning on making this into a mega blockbuster, with a big ensemble cast, much like Vin's other franchise (Fast & Furious) - they were probably hoping to make hundreds of millions of dollars in the process, spawning spin-offs and nine more sequels that nobody asked for or wants to watch.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

It was also good to see Donnie Yen was given a large part in the film as he is a fairly decent actor for mainly being a Martial Arts Actor.

Of course a lot of it is unrealistic like the Motorcycles transforming in Jet skis but isn't this why we go to the movies to escape reality and be entertained for a couple of hours..The film ended laying the groundwork on possibly another XXX film with the hint of Dual Agents...

It's over-the-top action and mindless violence with a weak story-line tied in to keep everything in order. And that's exactly what this franchise has always been about?Critics out there nitpicking over little details like the foreign locations and actors should seriously take a step back and remember what xXx has always been about.Xander Cage is back! And he's doing what he always does best - unbelievable stunts that have no place in reality. This is a feel- good movie and really an excuse to watch a bunch of guys beat up a bunch of other guys. That's it!It's the kind of movie you want to watch with a beer in your hand on a Sunday afternoon.

246,bluesdrummerkeith,Been some time since I seen a movie this bad.,1,12 March 2017,"I've been a fan of Vin Diesel since the beginning of his Career and will remain a fan but this is easily one of, if not his worst films to date.As a writer and an aspiring Actor myself, the story-line is beyond Garbage. How is it that crap like this makes it onto the big screen or even gets funded? There's so many ways you could do ""The return of Xander Cage"" and this is the worst.-Where's Yelena? -You know, the woman his risked everything for? Why didn't they use sound to emphasis key points in conversations? How come Xander Cage hasn't grown in all these years. What I mean is, as an individual person. He seems to be a cardboard cut out of himself way back in 2000. His Character lacks essence and life. In all honesty people, I can come up with a better plot and a better movie in ten minutes.Example: If they didn't want to use Yelena, they could've killed her character off, her death would drive Xander into a spiral of despair and he goes off the rails. Gets drunk as hell, does stunts that are crazy even for him. Xander's recklessness puts him back on Gibbons radar after years of evasion. While tracking him down for a mission in the CIA facility,being the patriotic man that Gibbons is, he tries to fight off the group that infiltrated and stole ""Pandora's Box"" and is killed in action. Gibbon's boss/Colleague takes over the xXx Program and sees that he had in fact found one of their greatest agents. She approaches Xander but he has lost interest in life as his despair festers at the loss of his loved one. She then informs him that Yelena's death was no accident and that an old acquaintance from the past stumbled (link a character form the first movie with cause) across him and ordered the hit on him (xander). Which leaves him on his deathbed and Yelena dies as Collateral damage. This also ties into a huge power play that leads to the taking out his former-handler, Gibbons who was getting close to an operation the said acquaintance from the past is involved with. Xander is on the Warpath stricken with grief, revenge and nothing to live for his rage drives his every movement. That took me less than ten minutes with no time to refine and develop the story at all. Yet I would watch this over the tripe I have just seen.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

249,Purdinator,A Thoroughly Unnecessary Return,3,27 January 2017,"For a film that's predicated on being dumb fun, ""XXX: The Return of Xander Cage"" seems rather uninterested in having too much of it. Often rote and plodding for a would-be thrill ride, the film feels more like a checklist being fulfilled than a genuinely creative endeavor. It's a business gambit, like most wide releases these days, but unusually bare-faced about it.That gambit lies on the broad shoulders of star Vin Diesel, who reprises a role that's about a decade past its sell-by date. Pushing fifty (believe it or not), he's clearly having a ball and wondering why he didn't do this earlier. But looking convincing as a daredevil spy with attitude is an increasingly difficult act to pull off. The producers seem to have anticipated this, as they have assembled a hefty supporting cast to help get Vin over the line.Chief among these (and the film's most welcome presence) is venerable Hong Kong star Donnie Yen, who touches off a panic when he and his exceedingly extreme crew (Bollywood's Deepika Padukone, fellow martial artist Tony Jaa, and UFC fighter Michael Bisping) snatch a satellite-controlling device from the inadequately vigilant CIA. Shaken, the spooks turn to a man after Yen's own heart - the exiled Diesel.Fortunately, years away have not dampened Diesel's skill at unorthodox spycraft. After taking some time to track down his garish fur coat (eliciting audible snickers from viewers at my screening), Diesel assembles a crew of his own, consisting of currently ubiquitous dynamo Ruby Rose, former K-Popper Kris Wu, and Rory McCann of ""Game of Thrones"" fame. It's a fatal mistake, as the sidekicks fail to thrill and serve only to provide forgettable quips and bog down the plot. It's hard not to think Diesel (and the entire film) would be better off without.Speaking of plot, anyone here for one is barking up the wrong tree; the action sequences are the main focus here. These are handled competently enough - Diesel's intro on skis then skateboard and a frenzied foot chase through a busy motorway serve as highlights. Alternatively, it's easy to see where director D.J. Caruso could have taken more care. A motorcycle chase running from jungle to beach is suddenly gummed up by commandos on a sandbar providing wildly inaccurate gunfire. How did they know to be there? Your guess is as good as mine. The shooting and missing carries on later during a pitched battle in a warehouse; if there's an award for that, those henchmen have surely earned it.All in all, it's a mainly joyless, overloaded exercise in style. Yen and Padukone do provide as much charisma as the paltry script allows and serve as passable foils for Diesel, who comes strictly as he is. That's by no means a bad thing, but it's not enough to elevate this paint-by-numbers enterprise. Nor does a too-subtued tone. The film simply doesn't capitalize on its inherent silliness. When you veer as close to spoof territory as this gets, it's best to just go all-out and that doesn't happen here. The end result is unwieldy and uninspiring.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

In fact, I walked in with a bucket of popcorn which I normally wouldn't do if I was expecting more out of the movie I was going to watch.But it was one cringe-worthy scene after the other for me. I was particularly surprised at Toni Collette's Jane Marke. I am assuming that Toni was not 100% on board with how her character was made to appear (styling was horrible!) because I have seen her portray such a variety of both sensible and odd characters admirably and this is the only one so far that was a disappointment. Samuel L. Jackson's Augustus was also a let-down but Mr. Jackson has made the same misstep once or twice before and his career has survived it.The odd mix of international actors (most likely a marketing decision), the not-so-impressive sets and costumes, the uninspired dialogue (previous movies' were sharper, wittier).

Excited beyond belief. Even got to go to an early screening several months before release day. And, of course, once it was released, I went to see it, because who wouldn't want to see that kind of action, right? But also, I wanted to see if anything changed. More like HOPED there were changes...but there weren't. As much as I wanted to love this movie. I can't. Breaks my heart to say that, but I have to.The action scenes, top notch. Loved them, actually. And that's why we go to these movies for the most part, right? But it's amazing how one little thing could ruin a movie for me. It ruined it during the pre-screening and while I was watching the movie after its release, it ruined it again. The Jane Marke character. Now, Toni Collette is a fine actor, really. It's not her. It's just...well, the character. It was so campy, like beyond campy, I couldn't get past it. Really kinda tainted everything. Oh, but I loved Serena and Adele.

The action sequences were exhilarating, if improbable but the overall package was a tongue-in-cheek take on the action/spy movie.
This reincarnation with Vin Diesel back in the role is utter garbage which would have us accept that a scrawny DJ, a lesbian, SJW feminist, and a somewhat cerebrally challenged rugby aficionado would somehow make a better support team - for an ageing xXx whose quips are lame and whose moves are simply not credible - than professional special forces personnel.
Thankfully, I didnt pay to see this - it was on TV and I just bumped into it while channel surfing. The tech support teenager is a gushing, star-struck floozy who isn't old enough to have been alive when the Lockerbie air crash occurred but claims to know ""the truth"" behind it... 
Xander Cage is nowhere near as likeable as in the first movie and the other characters are instantly forgettable. Vin Diesel should be ashamed of this tripe.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

Deepika Padukone makes her debut in Hollywood. She makes no effort in faking an American accent. She plays her character with conviction and originality. The action is well shot and over the top as expected. The jokes are cheesy and perfectly timed. Minor spoilers, there are some cameos and they nailed them..Vin Diesel always steals the show.. He is such a Bad ass.. He is energetic, charismatic and 'lives up' to the challenge of presenting the character of Xander Cage with full justice.. Donnie Yen Official: Bad-ass fist fights! Loved his performance.. Ruby Rose charming & such a hardcore lady in a movie.. Nina Dobrev Cute and cutely-hot and she did well for her part.

A good movie begins with a good story, not pecs: Terrible ""acting"", forced dialogue, plot riddled with holes like Swiss cheese. To add lemon juice to my already burning retinas, they tried so hard to add humor. Sometimes, I found myself asking, ""Wait a second! Was he trying to be funny there? Oh, I guess not...""

264,yukanda,How an action movie needs to be! Worth the watch! Don't listen to all the bad reviews!,9,18 April 2018,"XXx: Return of Xander Cage is worth it! This is how an action movie needs to be plain and simple! It starts by being original like in the 1st film and then it goes on with a good plan and perfect plot. It felt like something from 2003 and that's a great thing because back in the early 2000s and for most of the 1990s, movies were great back then and this movie brings back that original action feel that movies similar to this made back in those times ever were. If you don't like this movie, then you are completely blinded by what an action movie truly should be and this is a pure example of it! Great selection of actors, kept me on the edge like the original action movies of the day, and even added some awesome surprises like Ice Cube's appearance late in the movie. D.J. Caruso did a fantastic job at the directing and plot. It might seem as though it needed just a slight bit more, but it was enough for a satisfying watch from start to end and that is crucial to keeping people inside a movie theater for the best and most entertaining experience. I have never seen a movie like this in years and this was a rare make compared to any other action or epic movie I have ever seen since possibly Inception. Hollywood has gone down hill, but I found this movie a surprising turn of events in the movie making industry and goes to show that more movies like this can exist if only more Hollywood directors, cast, and crew can think hard and get serious and that's what they did in this movie. Got serious, took upon action, added a slight bit of comedy on the side, came up with a great amount of scenes which weren't fast-paced, they took their time on each shot and got serious just like what they did to any 1990s or early 2000s action movie! I mean compare this to an action movie today in 2018 where too many of the scenes go off balance and make everything look uninteresting and unappealing. When a movie is like that, it will lack originality in what a movie veteran watcher would want out of a killer action movie and this movie is the complete opposite with an original feel. This is how an action movie is made and if you can't see that in this movie and feel as though it should be like a movie that completely sucked with all of what Hollywood puts in their movies today (2013-2018) from someone who has seen a lot of original action films, you are completely blinded by what makes a great and original action film! 9/10 stars! Msg to Hollywood: MAKE MORE ACTION MOVIES LIKE THIS WITH ORIGINALITY, SERIOUS ACTORS, AND INTERESTING SCENES AND EFFECTS LIKE IN THE 90s and early 2000s! A RARE ACTION FILM TO WATCH IN TODAY'S TIME! :) WORTH THE WATCH!",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
265,danielgj-85299,Written by and made for your inner 12 year old,6,20 January 2017,"WOW. I wasn't expecting this. I don't know if it was because of all the hate giving me low expectations, or if the movie was actually good, but I enjoyed it. OK, so the movie isn't great, and arguable not good, but I still enjoyed it. I mean, sure its over the top, but that's exactly what this movie was supposed to be.The actors are what sold this movie to me. Vin Diesel plays an over the top in his 50s teenage skater/ adrenaline junkie/womanizer/man-child really well and gives the movie the self awareness that makes it worth watching. I haven't seen any of the other xxx movies, but Vin Diesel grew on me throughout the movie, he was actually great. Toni Collette and Nina Dobrev also had stand out performances in this. I liked Toni Collette's performance a lot, she plays the cliché overblown shady, uptight government agent very well. Nina Dobrev is hilarious, one of her best scenes came from her mannerisms when she uses a machine gun for the first time, I loved her in it. Again, they were all over the top, but done so beautifully. I love how much Toni Collette and Tony Gonzalez make Xander seem so out of place, Tony especially plays it straight and the contrast between them should make it clear this movie knows its ridiculous. To be honest I didn't like Donnie yen in the opening sequence, or the opening sequence in general for that matter. Don't get me wrong he was the best part of it, but I still didn't like it. The action in the opening sequence always involved sliding across a surface. I mean it gets out of hand. apparently if you're sliding or doing flips bullets don't affect you. There is just so much sliding in that part, that if there wasn't an overachieving janitor there the night before this entire heist would have failed. I wouldn't have minded the sliding and stuff, but the action here just wasn't enticing. I could almost see people just waiting to have their guns taken when Yen was ready to take it from them.Passed that Donnie Yen gets some excellent action scenes, two of which stood out to me most. One was in the plane at the end where he's just taking out soldier after soldier hand to hand, I don't think anyone else could of done this so well, and he's pretty funny in between action. The other scene was the fight in the middle of traffic, I'm almost ashamed to say how much I liked this scene. It was nerve wracking and anxiety inducing to me, which is a complement. Out of the other supporting cast Deepika Padukone is alright, she has a jaws tattoo sharing scene with Vin Diesel thats fairly forgettable if it hadn't reminded me a movie thats actually well directed. Rory McCann reminded me a lot of a lesser version of captain boomerang from suicide squad. Ruby Rose I didn't like that much at the beginning, I felt like some of her jokes and lines fell flat, besides that she was OK later on.Ice cube had a wasted cameo, it was completely unnecessary. He just comes in and blows stuff up and doesn't do much else. It seemed like he couldn't be scheduled to be on set at the same time with everyone else so they made him shoot a gun from far away for about a minute. I would've liked to see an actual action scene with him, or something cool, he just kind of halts the action with explosions in a surprisingly disappointing way. No comments on the plot, I don't know who the guy at the end was, or why he wanted the satellite control thing. I don't know why the main cast go from fighting each other to working together to fighting each other to random water ski motorcycle chase out of no where. Also some action scenes at the beginning were not fun, I didn't like the high jump, forest skiing road skate boarding at the start either. I felt like they were not shot well. On the other side of things, My favorite moment was at the end when Vin Diesel says ""I live for this s***"" and runs off the plane, that was the scene that sold his adrenaline junkie nature in natural and epic way. Other than that there are some fun moments, lots of women in bikinis, and basically a movie you should turn your brain off for. 6/10 (being a little generous here, looking back, the movie is pretty uneven).",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

The whole ""good guys meet cute with the villains"" has never been so ridiculously stupid and unbelievable--like, the best way to break into the villain's impenetrable island fortress is to come in on boats offering to sell some arms? Like, some totally bad ass dude like Xander just happens to show up right after the villains steal the world's most deadly weapon?

Pretty much the entire movie is an action scene which is a catch 22 in this film. It gets confusing after a while when you have enemies joining each other and then characters that were good guys becoming bad guys but the storyline itself is not overly complicated which is a good thing in this film.

There is not too much CGI and no stupid comic book characters. This is not Sicario, but it's not Transformers either. I have seen much worse. They say, ""January is where movies go to die."" The distributors of this movie knew it had enough strength to survive. Do not listen to the Hatters. Donny Yen is great, Tony Jaa's part is too small, but good.

Then there are people who definitely should have been killed but still they stay alive and then there are people who died and I don't know how.

Since some of the characters were the unusual types of people who one would expect to see in a XXX movie, it is hard to say that the acting was poor since they were portraying unique characters. There are a few plot twists and the last one could have been handled better, but the action makes up for it.One action scene depicted in the trailer with Vin Diesel riding a motorcycle through a wave was not quite believable.

The premise of this one is as in the first one, Xander Cage is an adrenaline-junkie with an extreme skillset who chases women and stunt thrills like a dog chases sticks, all while smiling. The NSA has an unconventional problem, and therefore needs this unconventional man, to help save the day. Despite some less-than-stellar CGI, and a somewhat messy (as in blurry and hard to follow) fight in act 2, xXx: Return of Xander Cage is an over-the top action movie that showcases men and women having fun, breaking the law, and saving the world while doing it. If you're after a realistic movie with depth and subtleties, go look at something else. This is a world where stuntmen/women and extreme sport athletes use their skills as super powers on the level with Captain America, and the NSA collateral damage insurance likely is on the level of a small country's GDP.This is basically a comic book movie, and while some of the jokes are seen a mile away, it's genuinely funny.

Foreign elements should be added if they were needed to tell the story and not simply just to please the foreign investors. They only make the story weaker. The story line of the movie was ridiculously unbelievable, and the screenplay was absolutely disappointing. The lines were so pale and redundant. It lacked what a big blockbuster movie should have.

It was so bad it was funny for a while...but for the first time in my entire life...near the end of the movie I started crying. With my wife laughing out loud at me, and the crowd in the cinema laughing out loud to the movie, two tears rolled down my cheek to how bad a movie can be in 2016. This movie was very very well planned. In a period with no major blockbuster, after the hype of Rogue One and with Assassin's Creed getting mixed reviews, it lines up a very very well targeted cast: few actors from famous TV Shows(GoT, OITNB,VD), one major Bollywood star, not one, not two but three major Asians showbiz stars..and remember...all this added to Vin Diesel and Samuel L. Jackson. By securing this cast you are so sure that your movie we'll be watched that you don't need to bother with screenplay. The action makes no sense at all...sure it's full of special effects but why???

293,bluefade999,Had potential!,5,11 March 2017,"I loved the first XXX movie. I thought it was a fun and fresh take on the spy thriller. You take an extreme sports junkie who goes against the system and is a take no orders type of character and in the end you see why it works. Sometimes you just need the unconventional person to get the job done. It was a great premise to a fun popcorn movie. It had exotic locations, beautiful women, a decent story (I mean it would be hard to come up with an original stop the foreign terrorist plot at this point so that even gets a pass) with a young and up and coming star and of course the always reliable Samuel L Jackson. xxx: Return of Xander Cage however falls short of the mark. It could have been a good sequel to Vin Diesels first movie if the makers had really given it some thought. To me (and unfortunately a slew of other movies recently) this seems like a cash grab. It's like the producers said ""we have a successful movie already. Lets get the original two stars, make up some throw away plot, toss in some cool karate kicks and blammo.....we are banking"". Well what is happening now is that people are showing that they are tired of these garbage movies being made and it was shown by only making about half of its budget back. If I had to describe this movie in one word it would be BORING. It was boring and lame. I mean they must have thrown in every corny line ever uttered in every cheese ball movie ever made. ""the things I do for my country""...yup, heard that in the first movie. ""Does this mean your not making me breakfast in the morning""..Really guys. ""Now this is a crew I can work with"" (said to his crew of experts that aren't experts of any kind whatsoever in any field and yet the government trusts them just because XXX said he trusts them).Don't get me wrong, I realize this is a work of fiction, but come on. Who wrote this script and better yet who approved it. This movie had an 85 million dollar budget and not one person said ""hey, maybe we won't have such throwaway dialogue and characters. Maybe, we should somehow make this just a little bit unique and different from every other cornball action movie out there so we can make a XXX 3 and 4 and 5. Unfortunately in my opinion this franchise is officially dead. I won't even mention the fact that people may not realize that Vin Diesel will be 50 years old in July of this year 2017 (oops). 50 years old and he is still supposed to be skateboarding around like some 20 year old hot shot having sex with gorgeous women literally half his age. Hey, two consensual adults making a decision is fine, but having a gang bang with like 6 of those women is a bit of a stretch. I had high hopes for this movie, but for me at least it just fell flat. Hopefully this will be one of the many movies already on a long list that will tell the film makers in the near future to stop making these trash throw away movies and actually make something fun and (even just a little) different from everything else out there.

His crew is assembled from useless guy, we're supposed (again) that they should be cool because they tell us so. The DJ guy is useless, the sniper is annoying, the ""crazy"" guy just boring.The CIA blonde executive is ridiculous and annoying.

Overall the movie is well paced like any other action movies with some good fight scenes, has a good cast who did their job good but it lacks a compelling story line and the screenplay is just normal making the movie watchable if you're bored and you don't have any other great movie to watch. Some scenes even defy the laws of gravity (eg: flight fight scene). Among the cast Vin Diesel's portrayal of Xander Cage is good Nina Dobrev's character is funny and good cameo from Neymar Jr.. The background music is okay from Brian Tyler.To sum this up the movie is a good watch if you don't mind the weak plot and into action movies.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

Vin Diesel should stick to Fast and Furious franchise, 2002 XXX was much better. Rest of the star cast is assembled to just please the producers ""Shanghai Movies"".There is no story, no screenplay, improper acting, it seems like director has wasted his most of the time in VFX labs than on actual story and screenplay.Disgraceful start to 2017, if you want to watch mindless graphical action, better play video game.

But if you like movies that usually get rated above a 6 on IMDb, just skip this one.The story line is full of plot holes (especially when you haven't seen the other movies you won't for example understand why Ice Cube suddenly shows up) and feels absolutely illogical. It also takes the strangest turns, within minutes we go from London to the Philipines without any good reason (probably only to have a nightly beach scene). The characters feel like they are made of plastic and never really develop. I still don't see why the DJ-kid was asked to join the party. My neighbor kid could also have joined Xander on his saga for that matter.Enemies turn into friends in less than a heartbeat and the acting feels really, really uncomfortable.In a nutshell: Xander Cage should have stayed in retirement.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

I think, the producers (Vin also one of the producers) may be thought that casting some stars from Worldwide will be making this very good flick. Well, it's actually does in some cases, if the plot was good and director know how to get good performances out of his actors. In my view, in this movie what I see, I see a waste of stars power. Actually, there is no twist in this movie even I saw the twist coming a mile away. Boring! The cinematography was so bad in some cases.

People also seem to have a problem with Deepika, it seemed weird right? Why?

The plot itself is horrible, along with their attempt to make you like the characters in any conceivable way. Simply put, there is no character development, and the story is one of the predictable ones used to show off their action scenes. In the way of performances, Vin Diesel did his normal, mediocre attempt. Michael Bisping did good for his limited screen time, however he seemed alone in that regard. Whomever was leading the editing sucked as the start seemed very rushed with shortened scenes that could've lead to good development, and the cgi used on the ocean scene was badly done as the green screen became very obvious as if they weren't even trying to hide it. All in all, not worth the money. Though the warehouse action scene and the chase was very good.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

Go for it for a eye catching action, visual effects, Vin and of course Deepika....nothing more. There's many good action and VFX. I think Hollywood directors should give more time on writing a real story before wasting their life in VFX editing room. In this film the climax would be exciting. But, it's not much i thought. From shooting period I was very excited about this movie, because of Vin and Deepika. So, I'm a little bit disappointed. Hope next Deepika's Hollywood film will be great. Deepika can say much more smarter English then this movie. Don't know what the director thought. and lastly I watched few recent big budget Hollywood movies without stories. Just VFX!!!

He was also in horrible movies like Man Apart and this thing. At least the first one was mildly amusing. But of course they take it too far and now it is a CGI-fueled live action video game that gets boring 7 minutes in. I left at the 75 minute mark. Wish it would have had some redeeming values other than a desire to make money. I hope Vin finds better projects in the future. That last thing about hunting Witches was even worse than this. Some of this is like a cartoon! The rest of the cast does no better. It seems everyone is going through the motions to grab a quick paycheck. No heart, no ambition and no need to waste you money.

Waste of money. It was hardly worth even being watch at home quality. All the best parts you will see in the trailer. So save your time and money and watch the trailer and your all set. Don't get me wrong it is loaded with action just b-rated action. I do like ole Vin diesel and the best part of going to see the movie was I got to see the trailer for the new Fast and Furious franchise. Yes I like that franchise.

I am doing something I've never done before and sharing my utter disenchantment with the direction this film went in.I was a fan of the original, an wanna-be anarchist and classic stereotype played against true anarchists who enjoy the finer things - what's not to like. Apart from a few bad lines, e.g. ""Think PlayStation, blow sh*t up"" (which always made me cringe) it was a good action film, I even owned the VHS! The less said about the second installment the better, but this new rendition leaves me wide eyes and opened mouthed.... think the clichés of the later Expendable films, plus the script written by a teenager tripping on the overpowering scent of lynx Africa and red bull. Final nail in the coffin, I'm actually a fan of Vin Diesel (yes I said that out loud). He's made some shockers (the pacifier) but Richard B Riddick will always have a place in my heart. So to conclude, if you're a fan of the original and have a soft spot for Vin D (admit it to yourself) steer clear of this epic disaster and prey it doesn't end up on your Netflix recommendations in the future.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

318,Aveek_Ganguly,The Worst Movie. Ever.,1,14 January 2017,"I and two friends of mine spent a lot of money between us to watch this movie today on the day of its release. Apart from wanting to watch Deepika, I had enjoyed the original XXX movie (this one is a sequel), plus I am a huge fan of Vin Diesel.However I came out of the theatre in a state of total shock! In my life I have watched thousands of movies, be it from Hollywood or Bollywood or from other parts of the country and the world. But today, and I am putting this down in writing, I got to see the worst movie of my entire life so far!! Yes really, I know what I am saying! So please please please ... try not to watch this movie ... it is so bad that it will make you want to cry. Or it will actually put you to sleep, like with the guy behind us in the theatre who was actually snoring within the first half hour itself!The movie has no story. It is not exciting as action films are meant to be, because the action itself is very cartoonish and very boring. It does not even have a proper climax, because it doesn't actually have a real villain who can pose a bit of a challenge to the hero! Yes it has several stunts, but you get to see most of them in the various trailers of this movie on YouTube. Let me put it another way: the best action scenes in this film are very very bad copies of scenes from the Matrix movies, and the two James Bond movies GoldenEye and Die Another Day. Plus the direction too is horrible, which results in many dialogues not being properly audible, poorly lit scenes, extremely erratic editing, poor acting ... or no acting, cos a lot of guys simply standing around doing nothing is not really acting ... this list is endless!Last but not the least: Deepika Padukone! Though I have always liked her until now, I still say it is not worth spending money to go and see her in this movie. Firstly her English sounds terrible over here. I have earlier heard Deepika speak English on TV and she sounds smart enough. So why is she speaking with a distinct South Indian accent in this movie ... when her name here is Serena Unger and not Meenamma from Chennai Express ... I mean could she not point out to the director that it would sound ridiculously out of place? Also her role is pretty small and her character is poorly etched out ... and so she doesn't really get a chance to act. And as for her looks in this movie, well, she easily looks much more prettier or glamorous in most of the Hindi films that she has starred in.So is this a movie review? Naw, it is more of a warning! Because XXX: Return of Xander Cage is so bad that it is not even a time pass movie. I score it a 1 ... out of 1000!",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

Why put an old white man who can't even drive, a computer geek ugly Betty and a DJ baller who can't even fight? Besides Vin Diesel and a few Asian stars who can secure Asian market, others are B-list cast from Hollywood. If you gonna make more XXXs, make all of them count please. Cheap XXXs make no difference! The fight scenes lack imagination too. We saw the stunts like skateboarding and plane fight too many times. Why don't figure out something new? The competition between two XXX teams could have been more fun and intense. But it was short and ended right before I got intrigued.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

He is in his late forties and acting like he is in his teens, still roller skating. If you are into skating like tony hawk while look like tony soprano, he is your man. Now lets get to the story line, Mr. Cage is doing the same stuff he did in part one, but this time it is different, because it seems he has a new team.No solid villains to put up a challenge to Mr. Cage, it feels like the villains are over powered at all times and no serious threat exists to the world or the xxx team members, as they kill American soldiers as well as Russians like a swiss knife through butter.If you are into monkey business, there is a lot of it in this movie. It seems all Japanese and Chinese do in Hollywood movies, is climb, run and even act like monkey's all the time, instead of having depth of character. Deepika is the saving grace of the movie, but even she is over burdened by the heavy weight of carrying the entire movie on her shoulders as no one can replace xxx. I fail to understand the flight sequence, in which the aeroplane flips upside down and all of a sudden ever things starts to float in the air instead of flipping around and zero gravity consumes the plane, during which time xander gets the gun and kills the bad guys. They director is probably a fan of sci-fi movies, with a fondness for what looks cool, instead of what feels right. If you are into non stop action and a no brainer, then this one is for you.

If you liked the first XXX you will love this one because it has all the cool stunts and extreme sports related action plus vin diesel absolutely crushes it. He gets to pick his own team this go around which is full of likable characters that provide the perfect kind of support. The plot is pretty twisty and entertaining as well.

The director was clueless how to make a movie. even the gun fight scenes were miserably crappy. I am actually shocked that Diesel would have made this movie, unless he was given a huge sum of money.

Just watch this movie with your friends who are fan of the same genre of movies. I loved the movie because the role of Xander cage is different from the Dominic Torretto from Fast and Furious movies. The stunts and the action was cool. Been a fan of the action by Donnie Yen and Tony Jaa from long time, so it was cool to see them as the supporting actors.

Hands down, this is the most worthless movie I have watched in the last decade and I want my money back. To stoop this low in terms of a story-line. Sorry, my mistake, there is no story. I have seen school plays better written than this movie. Make no mistake, this entire ensemble has been cast to just mint money. The dismal acting by some very bright stars of the movie industry makes you wonder as to why they would agree to a movie like this.The movie starts with an attempt at Neymar Jr. being recruited into the XXX program by Samuel L Jackson eating noodles for breakfast, then he is supposedly killed by a falling satellite. A gang of assumed super villains (which includes Deepika Padukone) then steal a box that can control satellites and crash them into the earth like kamikaze bombs only to find out, its not the actual box!

Her entry sequence is to die for and love how every person is perfect for their roles. Ruby and Nina particularly did a great job as did the rest of the cast. My biggest take away is Deepika Padukone. She has arrived . Global Domination . Matches up to Vin in every frame.The VFX is top notch and the action sequences have been brilliantly done.The director gives equal space to everyone in the cast and it is one film you don't want to miss if you love action flicks.,xXx - Return of Xander Cage

Donnie Yen is a legitimate Mixed Martial Arts fighter, as is Tony Jaa and even Micheal Bisping, but the fluidity of their fight sequences is stifled by the infuriating, twitchy editing technique that currently plagues Western action movies. This choppy style is usually reserved for actors who cannot perform their own stunt work, so it's an odd decision considering Yen and Jaa have repeatedly proved they can hold their own. Speaking of which, Deepika Padukone's highly awaited Hollywood debut is refreshing - she has a significant role that she plays with ample confidence and without a forced American accent, who can throw down with the rest of the boys, showcasing an Indian 'heroine' who has come a long way on the big screen.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

If you've any sense do not waste your money like I did. Some of the scenes are just ridiculous. Donne Yen must have been totally desperate for the money considering some of the great films he has made in the past. The female characters are as you would expect very attractive but do not make up for the awfulness of this film. Vin must be sat at home thinking OMG why on earth did I actually make that film as he probably doesn't need the money. The only good part of the film was near the end.

I'm just back from the cinema and it was worse than I expected.For me it shows what's wrong on a lot of action movies:It tries too hard to be spectacular. Everybody has a moment to be or look cool in that movie. All the characters are bad ass and can kick ass even to trained soldiers with weapons and bullet vest.It has no sense of danger. I never felt that anybody was in real danger. Everybody is so good that I never worried or even cared about any character. Quick example (kind of spoiler): they get attacked by armed soldier so a couple of girls just go to middle (no cover) and shoot at them while making cool poses for the camera.I didn't care for anybody because either I didn't get to know any of them and / or I new from the previous point they were not in real danger.I saw the first XXX movie, and I though it was entertaining enough, some sort of street wise James Bond.But this one is a waste of Donnie Yen (go and watch any of the IP Man movies instead if you want to see what can he do) or even more waste of Tony Jaa, he doesn't have any good action scene, go an watch Ong Bak to enjoy his skills. The same for rest of the cast, they could do better than that. The action scenes that are suppose to be the strong part of the movie (it's almost the only thing the movie has) are not so good or entertaining. Over the top as expected but nothing outstanding or new.Unless you are a huge fan of XXX and you are able to leave your brain at the door, I wouldn't waste the time on that movie.2 stars for Donnie Yen and for hot girls.",xXx - Return of Xander Cage
359,rwebb-14653,Vin Diesel is back for his second appearance in the third installment on the xxx franchise. Is it an ass-kicking movie or as lifeless as Vin's acting?,6,24 January 2017,"Vin Diesel is back for his second appearance in the third installment on the xxx franchise. Is it an ass-kicking movie or as lifeless as Vin's acting? When I was a very young lad, I once bought a VHS at the infamous Romford market. The bloke at the stand was a Chinese fellow and didn't speak a lot of English but I gave it a shot. I told him I wanted a Triple X movie. I had said that I wanted to see the lovable rogue, Vin Diesel, in his latest action flick, but instead I got a low-budget porn movie with a few hairy geezers and Eastern European woman who looked strangely like my next-door neighbor. In any case, my idea of xxx had changed forever and even when I finally got round to watching the Vin Diesel version, I wasn't really interested anymore. 15 years later and Vin Diesel is back in the role that changed my childhood. For some reason he was replaced by Ice Cube in the second xxx installment in 2005 but let's just forget about that flop. He still looks as though he has the muscles and the tattoos, and the husky voice hasn't gone away, but is this movie a genuine action flick or are the producers just trying to gain a quick buck with a big name and some explosions? My first qualm about this movie is that there isn't really a difference between Vin Diesel in xxx: The Return of Xander Cage and Vin Diesel in Fast & Furious. You could pretty much swap the characters and the movies would both be the same as they were. But, I guess, Ol' Vin's acting isn't the reason people will come and see this movie. I imagine that he's probably resigned to the fact he's never going to win an Oscar. The first xxx movie involved Vin working alone to save the day, but this time around he decided to put together a team to help him save the world from some proper nasty geezers. The team is an eclectic mix of hot birds and hunky dudes who help Vin to fight some Chinese people, whilst being incredibly outnumbered and outgunned, of course. The fighting scenes are pretty tasty, with Donnie Yen making a surprise appearance and smashing some bad-guy heads in. British UFC Champion, Michael Bisping makes his fourth movie appearance and, well, you guessed it, he fights pretty well also. Tony Jaa from Ong Bak is also involved in the action, as is Ruby Rose from Orange is The New Black. ""I guess the first time was kind of nerve wracking, but I guess I've always been a natural performer and I'm very at home doing this kind of thing. And yes, at first of course, anything you do is challenging. But the more time you do it, the more time you dedicate to that craft, the easier it gets!"" – Bisping talking about acting. The movie was interesting, I'll give you that. It was a far cry from La La Land, the last movie I saw at the cinema. The end was so ridiculous it was actually quite sublime with a cameo that is unexpected, to say the least (no spoilers!). The action scenes are well choreographed and the sets are authentic, whilst mostly getting destroyed. It is exactly what we have come to expect from a Vin Diesel movie, bar The Pacifier, in which I actually believe he deserves more credit for. It has girls, guns, fights and bad guys dying. The cast is strong and I would pay money to see this at the movies, if I was bored and there wasn't anything else on.https://thepraguegeezer.com",xXx - Return of Xander Cage

She also told an actress can play in the action film is their dream come true.

But this movie is so erratic and shot in a barrage to the senses that its like new Call of Duty games and crazy youtube videos. The point is that its made for pre-teens, and alienates the base demographic. I wish the MPAA had a rating for ""shot for tweens"".

Mainly because i don't like Ice Cube and i don't see him as an actor at all. However the second movie did nothing to redeem itself for that ill choice of casting. The third entry to the franchise is has is more like the sequel than the awesome original. Xander Cage is back. The amazing freestyle and just generally bad ass character from the first movie is here. It is explained that he did not die as it was stated in the second poor excuse for a movie but in fact survived and as cool as he was before. The first action scene with him blew my mind. Skiing in the rain forest? Just another day at the office for this guy. Also the dramatic irony at the end of his journey is priceless. It turns out that he was stealing a piece of hardware to allow the locals to see the football match between Brazil and Germany. I mean i am not an analyst but i believe that Brazil's chance of winning is 1 to 7. Everything was perfect in that scene for me. I didn't see anything out of place or other mistakes. Well at least on my first view.Honestly after watching that scene i thought that this will be a 10/10 movie. Well I was wrong The plot is so weak and non-existent it is painful to actually try to remember it. The main bad guy changes through the ""story"" so much times that you only remember that Vin Diesel is the good guy. Also i only learned the names of some characters at the end credits. The whole idea of the satellite control is quite interesting but it is not even the main focus. Instead it is based around the xxx teams with very few character development.
