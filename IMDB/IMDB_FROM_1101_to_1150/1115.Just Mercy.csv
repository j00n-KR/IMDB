0,MartinHafer,Take some of the very negative scores with a grain of salt....the film is amazing.,10,22 October 2019,"I saw ""Just Mercy"" a few days ago at the Philadelphia Film Festival and was blown away by the film....and I consider it to be one of the best movies I've seen in recent years. I could easily see the picture receiving several Oscar nominations---especially for acting. Imagine my suprise when I looked on IMDB and saw a score of 5.6 and some negative reviews! I am not exactly sure what this is all about and perhaps it's because there are some angry pro-capital punishment folks or some who simply hate a film with a mostly black cast. All I know is that the film is a quality production and kept my interest throughout.The story is based on the work of Bryan Stevenson, a Harvard graduate who chose to move to Alabama and work for a small salary to help examine the convictions of men on death row...men who in some cases were not guilty at all. How could anyone NOT applaud this sort of thing?!Overall, a brilliantly written film that made me sad and angry....and I love when a film effects me that way. The acting was top-notch, the story magnificent and the writing amazing. Just ignore all the negativity and see this one....you'll be happy you did. As for me, I'd consider this perhaps the best American film of the decade...it's THAT good.",Just Mercy
1,SnoopyStyle,good real life story,8,8 January 2021,"Walter ""Johnny D"" McMillian (Jamie Foxx) is wrongly convicted for the murder of a white woman and sentenced to death. In 1989, new Harvard law graduate Bryan Stevenson (Michael B. Jordan) arrives in the small Alabama county to fight for the disenfranchised on death row with help from local Eva Ansley (Brie Larson).This is real true life sincere advocacy docudrama. Jamie Foxx is doing great. Michael B. Jordan is holding back for the most part to play a stoic character until a few big emotional moments. The story is terrific and it's well told. It hits the right emotional notes. It really only falters when the movie tries too hard and it becomes a little preachy. Sometimes, less is more and this movie is plenty good enough.",Just Mercy
2,Prismark10,Just Mercy,6,14 April 2020,Movies about black injustice are nothing new. To Kill a Mockingbird is a famous example. Then there are those movies set in South Africa during the Apartheid era.Just Mercy is about Bryan Stevenson (Michael B Jordan) a Harvard graduate who established the Equal Justice Initiative in Alabama in 1989.One of the first cases he takes on is that of Walter McMillian (Jamie Foxx) who has been sent to death row for the murder of a white woman in 1986. McMillian claimed he was somewhere else at the time of the murder and was set up be some dicey testimony from a convicted offender.The local sheriff seemed determined to convict McMillian and is not pleased when Stevenson comes snooping around some years later.Just Mercy is a solid and ernest film about racial injustice in the south. The police are straight out of In the Heat of the Night. It was too formulaic.Even though it is based on a true story and is well acted. I would had liked something that broke up the formula of these types of dramas where the police are racist rednecks. Maybe the sad truth is that you have to stick with a cliche when it is the truth.,Just Mercy
3,nogodnomasters,The opposite of poverty is justice,9,9 January 2020,"The film is based on a true story that takes place in Monroeville, Alabama. Be sure to visit the Harper Lee Museum as you leave town. Johnny Lee (Jamie Foxx) was convicted of the murder of Rhonda Morrison. The conviction was based on perjured testimony. Bryan Stevenson (Michael B. Jordan) is a Harvard lawyer and is in town to defend the poor and bring justice to death row cases. He believes Johnny Lee is innocent and attempts to get his conviction overturned.Jamie Foxx gave us a great performance. Brie Larson demonstrates she can do something other than parade around in a tight costume. Michael B. Jordan was fine, but I can only think about how Denzel would have done it better.I am a sucker for films based on true civil rights stories.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity in this prison film.",Just Mercy
4,kosmasp,BLM,9,6 June 2020,"Even more relevant with what happened to George Floyd right now ... though unfortunately I reckon any time in the last decades you could say this was relevant. The systemic racism on display here, the racial injustice quite openly ... it's heart breaking. And seeing many things that more or less happened in one way or another.Jamie Foxx probably would have wanted to be the lead here, but he understood he was past that. And getting Michael B. Jordan was quite the coup. Those two feed off each other, while Jamie Foxx was also a driving force in doing this. Haven't seen him on any talk show the last couple of days, which is curious, then again, the movie was released quite a while ago.This is heavy and not an easy watch, but essential. Let's all educate ourselves - by doing and researching things. We can do it - we are better than this (the situation depicted in the movie and the situation in real life).",Just Mercy
5,CinemaSerf,The cast don't quite do justice to this slightly too set-piece a legal drama.,7,27 January 2020,"This is quite a compelling story of accomplished US lawyer Bryan Stevenson (Played here by Michael B. Jordan) who has spent much of his professional life trying to free wrongly convicted prisoners on ""Death Row"". This film deals with his first such case as he struggles against a community and an establishment to prove the flaws in the conviction of Walter McMillian (Jamie Foxx). The film itself isn't great - Jordan and Foxx aren't brilliant; and Brie Larson makes a minimal impact - but taken in the context of the bigoted and downright dangerous environment in which they all worked to address some almost comedic travesties of justice, it is certainly well worth watching.",Just Mercy
6,grantss,Not very original but interesting and profound enough,6,11 October 2020,"A young Harvard lawyer moves to Alabama and sets up an organisation that sets out to provide justice for those that can't afford it. One of his first cases involves a man convicted of murder and sitting on death row. The evidence points to him being innocent but in Alabama verdicts often don't depend on whether you're guilty or not.A reasonably interesting story of injustice, and justice. Not very original, being derivative of many movies with similar themes, e.g. To Kill A Mockingbird (the film even takes place around where the book was set), The Hurricane and Dead Man Walking. It also takes a while to get going - the plot is drawn out for the first half or so - and many of the characters are stereotypically drawn, so for the first half it's a bit disappointing and a bit of a grind.However, it all comes together quite well in the end. The final 45 minutes or so makes for very interesting viewing and the conclusion is quite profound and emotional.Overall, reasonably interesting but takes some patience. The impact of the film is also largely dependent on whether you've seen similar films on the subject.",Just Mercy
7,oscaralbert,The always eponymous Warner Bros. warn America that the Confederate Reign of Terror . . .,9,17 January 2020,". . . is still endemic among the deplorable basket of ""Red States,"" shown here to be full of malingering miscreants monopolizing and squatting on the space of actual normal useful human beings across our USA Homeland. Talk about an ""Oscar snub""! JUST MERCY deserves 18 of the 20 acting nominations available for the 2020 Academy Awards (that is, ALL of them, except one Best Actress nod to ""Renee"" for JUDY and a Best Actor gelded statuette to ""Joaquin,"" aka JOKER). As America's long-time ""Canary in the coal mine,"" a national consensus of film professors concur that Warner has been deprived of AT LEAST 750 Oscars over the past 91 years--this awards loot has been filched by an unworthy Racist ilk through corrupt corporate Fat Cat One Per Center shenanigans. Fortunately, in 2019, Science discovered the CS (for ""Core Supporter"") gene, obviously shared by The Academy's voting majority. This genetic defect is incurable, making those harboring it highly susceptible to demonic possession! Worse yet, as JUST MERCY illustrates, it is passed down through the generations. Blessedly, other Warner films have recently presented the Solution to this CS gene crisis. After mandatory testing, the estimated 100 million Pachyderm Party Pariahs MUST be stripped of their citizenship, guns, land, wealth and other assets--THEN promptly deported to Siberia, the best limbo land for such spayed or neutered existential threats to Humanity!",Just Mercy
8,view_and_review,A Test of Emotional Endurance,10,16 January 2020,"""Just Mercy"" is one of those rare movies for me where I actually read the book before seeing the movie. The book is absolutely incredible and my only hope was that the movie would do the book justice--and by extension of that, do Bryan Stevenson justice. The book ""Just Mercy"" is essentially a memoir from Bryan Stevenson about his life, post Harvard, aiding death row inmates in the South. He spends the bulk of the book on the specific case of Walter McMillian and his efforts to get him not only removed from death row, but to get him exonerated completely.This movie will drag you down to the depths. It is not a movie that you plop down and watch, you have to mentally prepare yourself for the emotional toll that your psyche will take. ""Just Mercy"" mercilessly assaults your emotional cavity. It tests your emotional endurance. It will take you to the brink, and for some it will take them past the brink. At one point someone in the theater shouted, ""---- you!"" to the screen. I had no complaints because he only said what I was feeling.After dragging its audience to the depths of anger, despair, and sadness it snaps them back with equal and opposite force. The pure unbridled elation that hits you is just as uncontainable as the anger and sadness moments before. I found myself in tears three times which for me has to be some kind of record.This may all sound like a warning and it is to some degree. This is not a warning for you to avoid the movie, please go, it is a warning to bring your emotional shield, because should you go in there bare and uncovered it will rip your heart out before you finish the movie.",Just Mercy
9,ferguson-6,a man of action and of his word,6,9 January 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. 2019 movie year brought us BRIAN BANKS, CLEMENCY, and now JUST MERCY. Three movies centered on death row and racism in the justice system. Being imprisoned for a crime one didn't commit is simply something most of us can't fathom. Add in the death penalty, and it truly becomes a horrifying tragedy. Bryan Stevenson is a Harvard Law graduate who founded Equal Justice Initiative, a non-profit organization whose mission is to get innocent/wrongly convicted people off of death row.Filmmaker Destin Daniel Cretton (SHORT TERM 12, THE GLASS CASTLE) brings Mr. Stevenson to the screen through the story of Walter ""Johnny D"" McMillian. Mr. McMillian was so obviously not guilty, that the road block set up to stop him on his way home from work speaks to the deep-rooted racism embedded in an Alabama police force so desperate to solve the murder of a white woman. Oh, and the town is Monroeville. The same town where Harper Lee wrote ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" Cretton's script, co-written with Andrew Lanham (THE GLASS CASTLE) follows attorney Stevenson's efforts to unravel the racism and miscarriage of justice.Michael B Jordan plays Bryan Stevenson, and Oscar winner Jamie Foxx plays Walter McMillian. Their shared scenes are extraordinary, and bring out the best in Mr. Foxx. Oscar winner Brie Larson (Mr. Cretton's good luck charm) plays Stevenson's assistant Eva Ansley, a hard-working idealist, who unfortunately is given little to do here. Tim Blake Nelson makes quite an impact as Ralph Myers, a convicted murderer with a twitchy delivery - and the state's only witness against Walter. Rafe Spall is the corrupt DA with a southern accent that is painful to our ears, and Karan Kendrick plays Walter's wife Minnie. In an all-too-brief turn, O'Shea Jackson plays death row inmate Anthony Ray Hinton, whose story could just as easily be at the center of movie like this one.The film opens in 1987 and continues through McMillian's re-trial in 1992. Along the way Mr. Jordan effectively portrays a man that realizes things are much worse than he anticipated. The film is based on Stevenson's 2014 memoir ""Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption"", but it's Mr. Foxx who excels here. He conveys the feelings of resignation that the man has for his situation ... a situation so beyond his control, and one that he understands is biased against him. Watching McMillian come to trust Stevenson through actions rather than words, is exceptional acting by Foxx. We've seen how hope can be a dangerous thing on death row, and it's certainly an emotion that Foxx's McMillian is slow to embrace.Bryan Stevenson is now a world renowned Civil Rights attorney and his foundation has made a difference for many convicts. He continues to fight against a racially-biased system, and it does seem that the attention is causing a change in attitudes. The movie comes across a bit slick and formulaic for the message it carries, but perhaps that's by design so that more people will give it a watch. The intent is certainly admirable.",Just Mercy
10,deloudelouvain,And that's why capital punishment is wrong.,8,1 October 2020,"Just Mercy is another movie about the failing American (in-)justice system, a system they are so proud of but that the rest of the world sees like biased, racist, (dis-)functioning with two weights and two measures, a law for the rich and a law for the poor. Justice and law should be the same for everybody, whether you're black or white, whether you're rich or poor, regardless of your religion and/or beliefs. The truth is quite the opposite and even after a honorable person like Bryan Stevenson that tried to change things it's still failing now. The story is based on what Walter McMillian had to endure during a big part of his life, a biography that won't leave anybody without an opinion. It's well acted, maybe a bit slow at times, but because it's based on true events you can't help it to be drawn into the story. I can't imagine being on death row for years when innocent, and that while a lot of people know you're innocent, just because you have a different color of skin. America should be ashamed of themselves, instead they still believe they're are the country of equal chances and opportunities, what a joke! Just Mercy is a good movie, a must watch, certainly if you still have a tiny bit of humanity and compassion for others, a quality a lot of people lack of.",Just Mercy
11,FeastMode,great movie,6,4 July 2020,"An inconceivably true story with great acting and some really powerful scenes. it hit me hard, and makes me sad and infuriated that we still haven't come nearly far enough. i really don't understand how stuff like this is allowed to happen.i have no negatives with this film. the only reason the score isn't higher is because i'm generally not a fan of movies based on a true story or biopics. i find they lack excitement and unpredictability. but if you like those kinds of movies, this is a great choice, more like an 8/10 based on those standards (1 viewing, 7/3/2020)",Just Mercy
12,Lejink,When Justice Goes South,7,15 March 2020,"If Hollywood has to film every miscarriage of justice in the U.S. legal system to squeeze out every little last bit of prejudice of all kinds, be it on race, sexual orientation or privilege to name but three, to help stop future unsafe convictions like the historical one highlighted here, the celluloid will have been well used. I say historical but this case in fact dates back not to the 1950's or 1960's as you might expect but to the much more recent 1989. I don't think it's coincidence however that there are very few contemporary time markers used here, drawing the viewer to the perception that they could be witnessing a case like this in the present day and that nothing therefore has changed much in the intervening 30 years.Unsurprisingly, the locale for the action here is the American Deep South where young black solicitor Bryan Stevenson, played by Michael B Jordan combines with local white woman Eve Ansley, played by Brie Larsen, to set up, despite the resistance of local officialdom, the Equal Justice Initiative to look into the convictions of death-row prisoners, suspecting, as we quickly see with good cause, that many have in one way or another been poorly served by the justice system. We are told at the end of the film that the real Stevenson has to date overturned over 140 such convictions but the film concentrates on his two earliest investigations, one where he fails and the inmate is executed and the other, where he is ultimately successful in getting his client freed.The first case Stevenson tackles, that of Herbert Richardson, played by Rob Morgan, is important in establishing that not all the death-rowers are complete miscarriages of justice. Vietnam vet Richardson freely admits that he set off a bomb which killed his victim, but is clearly shown to be suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder which condition should at the very least have seen him avoid the death sentence, but no, despite making a strong case for a less severe sentence, the petition to stay the execution is rejected and so we see Richardson go to his death by electric chair in a sombrely recreated execution scene, with Stevenson present to witness at first hand the price of his own failure and how much work he will have to do to turn around the ingrained institutional racism which seems to have its own biased agenda as regards non-whites.So he next takes up the case of Jamie Foxx's Walter ""Johnny D"" McMillan, on Death Row for the violent murder of a young white woman. McMillan is no angel but is clearly innocent of the crime as we see Richardson reveal the holes in the evidence which the prosecution has used to railroad McMillan.Early in the movie, Richardson is recommended more than once to visit the local museum dedicated to the famous Harper Lee novel ""To Kill A Mockingbird"", the best-known fictional story about a black man wrongly and prejudicially convicted of a capital crime, the irony of which completely escapes the law enforcement personnel so directing him. This is real life, almost 30 years after Lee's supposedly groundbreaking novel, where it seems the more things change, the more they stay the same.The movie is directed and acted in a notably unshowy way, with Jordan displaying Attica Finch-like quiet nobility and doggedness to bring the truth to light. Morgan and Foxx are also good in their roles as the mistreated convicts. Some of the bigotry shown by for example one of the prison officers, the local sheriff and the local D.A., all white of course, seems hard to credit and one would hope aren't exaggerated or worse, fictionalised for dramatic impact. I would personally have appreciated some point of view from the murdered girl's family and could also have done without the cliched use of gospel choirs it seems at every big dramatic or emotional moment which over-emphasised, in my opinion, the colour-divide.Like I said at the start, there's a sad, almost inevitable familiarity to the depiction of events here and no doubt there are many other cases like these two, these three in fact as we learn right at the end that another inmate has been finally pardoned after spending over 30 years on Death Row. I've watched so many films and documentaries on similar subjects to this down the years, with this one being another solid if unexceptional production. I always think that surely things must be changing in America but I've yet to see it manifested in modern times.I live in fading hope.",Just Mercy
13,MOscarbradley,Much more than just another 'inspirational true story'.,8,9 November 2020,"""Just Mercy"" might have been just another inspirational true story of the kind the American cinema seems very fond of and which they usually treat with much larger dollops of sentimentality than necessary but thanks to director Destin Daniel Cretton's expert handling of the material, a fine script and first-rate performances from Michael B. Jordan and Jamie Foxx this is much more gripping, moving and intelligent than it could have been. It's the story of young African-American lawyer Bryan Stevenson and his fight to free wrongly convicted death-row prisoner Walter McMillan; Jordan is Stevenson and Foxx is McMillan. Of course, that's just the up close and personal element; what it's really about is America's Systemic Racism and although it's set thirty odd years ago the tragedy is it could have been made yesterday.It's also a thriller, a kind of companion piece to ""In the Heat of the Night"" but without the grandstanding, Oscar-bait, crowd-pleasing elements and instead of a scenery-chewing Rod Stieger we have a much more nuanced Ralf Spall as a small town Southern lawyer. In fact, all the performances are first-rate with everyone underplaying superbly, (there's an Oscar-worthy turn from Tim Blake Nelson as a key witness), but the casting is just one of the film's many strengths. Cretton and Andrew Lanham's screenplay is humorous as well as honest while Cretton directs in that straightforward, classical style that Clint Eastwood has honed to perfection. Indeed Eastwood could easily have made this and if he had we would be hailing it as one of his finest films. Cretton has every reason to be proud.",Just Mercy
14,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Law abiding citizen.,8,25 January 2020,"The set-up of 'Just Mercy (2019)' is sadly all too familiar: an innocent black man put on death row basically just because he apparently ""looks like a killer"". This unfortunate familiarity doesn't stop the flick from telling an engaging and affecting tale, though. It does a fantastic job unveiling its central situation, examining America's unjust justice system and the community-based anger that perpetuates its problems. At times, it's incredibly frustrating; you feel the unfair friction between the characters just trying to do the right thing and the bigots nonsensically trying to stop them. It's compelling and important stuff. It also manages to be incredibly emotional, often having you in tears of various kinds (despair, anger, joy). It's a bit of a slow-burn but it has an excellent pay-off. It's impactful, for sure. The pitch-perfect performances get you invested in every single character, most of whom have a strong foundation in reality. The movie does a great job of making you care, to the point that it almost doesn't matter that it's based on a true story. It is based on a true story, though; a hundred true stories, even. It feels like it needs to be seen, practically oozing out its focal message. It's a strong effort. 8/10",Just Mercy
15,ThomasDrufke,Powerfully Earnest,8,30 January 2020,"Not too dissamilar from 'Clemency', Just Mercy revolves around the story of a few death row inmates (some wrongly convicted) and a defense attorney Bryan Stevenson (Michael B. Jordan) who is determined to seek justice for them. Full of powerful performances and wonderfully earnest story, Just Mercy is a well-oiled machine perhaps just out of reach of awards contention this year. But that doesn't take away from the importance of the story Destin Daniel Cretton is telling, which is one we should be paying attention to, still just as resonate in 2019, decades after Stevenson began his work.8.2/10",Just Mercy
16,Cineanalyst,The Irony of Killing a Mockingbird,7,8 June 2020,"I feared ""Just Mercy"" would be another preachy courtroom drama with a simplistic message and would take liberties being based on a true story for formulaic dramatics. To an extent, it is just that, but it's hardly the worst offender, reportedly is faithful to most of the important facts, and I appreciate the irony of the story, with the reflexive mix of fiction and fact it raises, in relation to the archetype of such narratives, Harper Lee's novel ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" famously adapted to film in 1962. Like that fictional story, the real one of ""Just Mercy"" is based on a book, the titular memoir by Bryan Stevenson, the lawyer in the movie played by Michael B. Jordan.The ironies include the trial and capital punishment of a Black man for a murder he didn't commit in the same Alabama town of Monroeville where Lee's book is staged. This is despite that fictional narrative having become so culturally ingrained that, in the movie, Stevenson receives the recommendation to visit the courthouse where Atticus Finch argued his case, in addition to another recommendation from the District Attorney to visit a Civil Rights site before leaving town. Yet, decades later, the legal system of Monroeville is trying to kill another innocent Black man, Walter McMillian, as portrayed by Jamie Foxx in the movie. The irony seems to be lost on the same folks, too, of a judge named after, of all people, the leader of the Confederate Army, Robert E. Lee, having overturned a jury's sentence so as to kill McMillan--with the righteous unintended consequence of that being that McMillan likely would've spent his entire life in prison had the judge not done so and, thus, garnered attention from activists and lawyers the likes of Stevenson. To top it all off, in what seems far too much on the nose to possibly be true, ""Just Mercy"" recreates the racial segregation of the famous set from ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" with white characters sitting in front and Black characters standing in back. On one hand, this is the cinematic lecturing equivalent of being hit over the head with a hammer, but it's apt in its way, too, by alluding to its written and filmed predecessor.It helps, as well, to feature a cast including Jordan, Foxx and Brie Larson. While once in a while a character might, say, slam their fist on a table to reject a lawyer's services in overly-dramatized fashion, or go off on a tangent of speechifying when not even in a courtroom, these sort of melodramatics tend, for the most part, to be kept within or below normal parameters for a courtroom drama and social-problem picture. The actors here are talented enough to convey the internal workings of their characters without resorting to such hammy theatrics, and ""Just Mercy"" is at its best when the script and direction allow them to demonstrate that. I'll take this any day over, say, Denzel Washington screaming, no matter how ensnaring it may be, and a blaring score, regardless of how catchy, in ""The Hurricane"" (1999), another based-on-a-true-story and racially-charged tale of wrongful conviction. Especially when the anti-racist message is obvious to the point of bluntness, it need not be exacerbated by acting and the rest of the filmmaking being likewise.To be fair, ""Just Mercy"" manages to deliver its message, including the conversion of good Caucasian characters, without marginalizing the struggles of its African-American protagonists or resorting to ""white savior"" tropes. It's not a hollow lecture such as the hypocritically self-congratulatory Best Picture ""Green Book"" (2018). Plus, the moral of the story is inherently still needed; the ironies of the narrative wouldn't exist had the lessons been learned the last time from Atticus Finch re killing mockingbirds.",Just Mercy

Normally these advanced screenings are almost sell outs.I can't believe this blatant injustice was based on a true story, based off the lawyers book. Considering it is based on a true story, it is a bit precicfable at times, and you know where it is going most of the time. I also need to add, it is not a feel good movie at all, but I think most people will like it.It is a very compelling movie, I was wrapped up in it throughout. Michael B Jordon is terrific, Jamie Foxx gives his best performance since Collateral and Ray!! Rob Morgan and Tim Blake Nelson offer solid support, whilst Brie Larson is also effective.

21,cruise01,"Emotional, strong, and a story about the wrongfully accused.",8,16 April 2020,"(4 out of 5 stars.)Just Mercy is a good legal drama film about Bryan (Michael B. Jordan) who tries to help Walter (Jamie Foxx) in proving his innocence from death row. From the murder of a young girl which Walters family knows it could not have been him since they were with him. While the police are against Walter. And are against Bryan for defending him. Alabama's DIstrict Attorney is against him without any evidence.The plot is good and the script and direction had a good strong drama that brings the terror of reality that people are wrongfully accused. And are facing death row. To make matters worse. People are discriminating others cause of there color of skin and the low class status. It is a tough drama to watch as the Sheriffs and police are discriminating others from there race. Like an officer pulling over Bryan for no reason to search through his car and they had him at gun point. While Bryan was cooperating and calm about the situation.The cast ensemble is good. Michael B. Jordan is good playing as Bryan. Jamie Foxx delivered a good performance as well. Brie Larson was also good playing Bryan's partner. The performances are great. The script and direction delivered a emotional drama film about a real story.Overall, Just Mercy is a good film. The direction and script delivered a strong emotional drama. The story is good. The acting is great. I did find the movie to be a little slow in the middle. But still a good film worth seeing.",Just Mercy
22,zkonedog,Solid True Story Drama; No New Cinematic Ground Broken,6,5 April 2020,"It's a bit difficult to judge a film like ""Just Mercy"". On one hand, it tells a true story that deserves to be told. On the other hand, it breaks no new cinematic ground in doing so and as such may come off as a bit ""on the nose"" for more ardent movie fans.For a very basic overview, this film tells the story of Walter McMillian (Jamie Foxx), a man on death row in Alabama awaiting his execution date. One day, recently-graduated Harvard lawyer Bryan Stevenson (Michael B. Jordan) arrives in the Deep South with hopes of setting up an institution to help such individuals. Stevenson immediately concludes--via a lack of hard evidence and flimsy eyewitness testimony--that McMillian is assuredly innocent, and thus begins a campaign to free him from his death sentence.There are a good amount of positives in ""Just Mercy"", with the overall story itself being the largest and most worthwhile. Basically, this is a story of injustice towards the black community of Mobile, Alabama. While McMillian is eventually freed, the fact that it takes such a herculean effort is the film's proof of institutional racism.One scene in particular also stands out, in which an inmate not as fortunate as McMillian is escorted to the electric chair chamber and put to death. This is perhaps the most harrowing depiction of that process I have ever seen put to film. One of the few truly visceral moments in the viewing experience.Of course, therein lies the biggest ""problem"" with ""Just Mercy"": it's exactly the type of movie you think it is. Institutional police and community racism from the white community towards the black community. There are no wrinkles, no surprises, simply that and only that. From a strictly human-interest perspective, one probably shouldn't need anything further to justify a film's existence or overall quality. From a cinematic perspective, though, it's a story that has been told numerous times over the past decade or so. So for anyone looking for new themes or takes in their film-watching experience, they may be a little disappointed here.Overall, I think one's ranking of ""Just Mercy"" comes down to why they watch movies in the first place and where one might be on that journey. If the goal is to be challenged in some way, or consider something from a new vantage point, this one may leave something to be desired (if still being ""solid"" in a filmmaking sense). If simply taking the themes and characters at face value and not trying to dissect the overall experience, one will probably bump the star rating a few higher than myself. It just depends on personal viewing tendencies.",Just Mercy
23,eddie_baggins,An important story executed in a generic way,7,23 April 2020,"An important true story to tell, Just Mercy came and went with little fanfare when it was released towards the latter part of 2019 and early 2020, despite some solid performances and loaded subject matter, making this feature another commercial and critical disappointment for talented director Destin Daniel Cretton.Next to be seen cinematically handling Marvel's risky but hyped Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Cretton broke out into the industry with his great indie effort Short Term 12 but found the going tough with his unfairly treated The Glass Castle adaptation and he would've been hoping that his awards baiting look at the work of death row lawyer Bryan Stevenson could've been his genuine breakout hit.Unfortunately for Cretton and the film this was not to be the case and while there are many solid elements to Just Mercy throughout, with particular respects to Jamie Foxx's restrained performance as the wrongly accused death row inmate Walter McMillan and Tim Blake Nelson's scene-stealing support as petty criminal Ralph Meyers, Cretton's film feels too held back throughout as you wait for its truly enthused power to come.Everything about Just Mercy feels restrained, for a film dealing with a plethora of heavy themes, subject matters and intriguing characters, you'll be wishing Cretton really went for it more as everything plays out in a very stoic and un-fussy fashion making the plight and investigation of Michael B. Jordan's Stevenson mostly lifeless across the films 2 hour plus running time.We never really feel any type of rush of anticipation about what Stevenson is unearthing about McMillan's clearly corrupted case handling or the big implications of what it all means in a larger sense of scale, while the films inability to make the most of its support cast, that includes Brie Larson, O'Shea Jackson Jr. and Rafe Spall in roles that fail to make use of their talents, showcases clearly that the film had more it could've done to make itself a more genuinely unforgettable true life tale of justice sought.In no world could Just Mercy be considered a bad film, the story it tells is to important and there are moments scattered throughout that hit the viewers hard, no more so than an extended sequence in which one of McMillan's cellmates is delivered to meet his end via the electric chair, but there's an inescapable feeling here that Just Mercy is an almost film, close to being great at times but far from the truly powerful offering it could've easily been.Final Say -Not as outstanding as Cretton's previous two cinematic efforts, Just Mercy is solid film-making that features some great performances but its simplified approach to its material makes it a more generic affair, of the likes we've seen many times before.3 ½ tin cups out of 5",Just Mercy

Most countries (if not all) will have differing levels of injustice, especially concerning minority or underprivileged peoples.

It all felt a bit safe and familiar.That's only a minor criticism though, because this movie is definitely still worth watching.Jamie Fox really delivers as an actor.

28,paul-allaer,"Underlying story line will make your blood boil, but the movie itself is too long and too uneven",6,18 January 2020,"""Just Mercy"" (2019 release; 136 min.) is ""based on a true story"" we are reminded in the beginning. As the movie opens, we get to know Walter McMillian a/k/a Johnnie D. and before we know it (as in: literally the first few minutes of the film), he is wrongly accused of a white woman's murder he didn't commit and is on death row. We then get to know Bryan Stevenson, an African-American law student at Harvard Law who is interning for the summer at a social justice place. Stevenson meets Johnnie D., who is disappointed that he is ""just"" a law student, and not a lawyer. Nevertheless they hit it off. We then go to ""Two Years Later"", and Stevenson, newly graduated from Harvard Law, is saying goodbye to his family in Delaware and about to drive down to Alabama, where he plans to work at the new Equal Justice Initiative... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: in films like these, it is not always easy to distinguish the underlying story and the inherent quality of this as a movie-viewing experience. Let's be very clear: the underlying story will make your blood boil. Remember this is set in the late 80s and early 90s, and the systematic, pandemic and institutional racism and bigotry that existed in Alabama in those days is nothing short of appalling and shocking. Anything goes, and does. But did it translate into a top notch movie? The answer is... at times. There are some magnificent scenes in the movie, but there are also too many uneven moments. It is a darn shame that this movie wasn't edited a bit tighter, because its running time of 2 hrs. 16 min,. is way too long for its own good. I venture to say that a good 20-25 min. could have been cut without the movie losing and of its essence, and it probably would've made this a truly compelling viewing experience. (There is a reason this movie didn't gain a single Oscar nomination when they were announced earlier this week.) The movie is directed by Destin Daniel Cretton, who has previously given us Short Term 12 and The Glass Castle (all starring Brie Larson, who also appears in ""Just Mercy""' (albeit in an unremarkable, almost bland, role). Michael B. Jordan and Jamie Foxx carry the movie on their shoulders as Stevenson and Johnnie D., respectively. Make sure you stay all the way through the movie's end credits, as we learn what has become of these people and where they are today.""Just Mercy"" premiered at last Fall's Toronto International Film Festival to good acclaim and after a limited release in December, the movie went wide last weekend. I finally saw it this weekend. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay (about 20 people). If you are interested interested in social (in)justice, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Just Mercy
29,subxerogravity,Slow burn but worth it.,7,27 December 2019,"The movie starts off tugging at your heart strings. You get into it real quickly but then just when you think it's about to be over a new obstacle steps in and drags the story along. In this case that's perfect because the idea is to truly understand what these people were going though when it comes to the injustice of the poor and the black.
Good work by all. Micheal B Jordan did not really stretch his acting muscles more than he was proving himself a great leading man. Jamie Fox on the other hand was bringing great black star power that would grant him an Oscar. Don't know if they'll even nominate him but his performance In this movie was good enough for a supporting nod.

30,jtindahouse,A strong movie that had the potential to be even better,7,1 April 2020,"The whole time I was watching 'Just Mercy' I couldn't help thinking to myself that I wish Jamie Foxx and Michael B. Jordan had swapped roles. Jordan does what he does well, but can be quite flat I find in his performance a lot of the time. Foxx on the other hand is one of the most watchable actors working today. I feel that when the movie was in a lull, which happens a few times throughout the runtime, he would've been the one to drive the film through that. It didn't ruin the film for me, it's just something that in an ideal universe would've been the case.'Just Mercy' does what it sets out to do well. It has an agenda, and it pushes it heavily. The death penalty debate has and always will be a divisive one. I can't help feeling that the film would've been more powerful if it focused on getting innocent men released, rather than including trying to get guilty men off their death sentence. It's fine to have that point of view, but they have to know that not everyone will feel that way. There's even a scene in the film where a man (who admits his guilt) is asked to say his final words, and instead of saying ""I'm sorry for what I did"" as you would expect, he says ""I feel no ill will towards anyone"" as if he's the one being wronged. That's where I think the movie got it wrong.All that aside though there are plenty of positives to come out of this film. It's based on a true story and I felt it did a good job of portraying the real events to anyone like myself who had no familiarity with them. It also did a really good job of making the characters either extremely likeable or extremely hatable, depending on which side of the ledger they were on. The courtroom scenes were certainly when the film was at its strongest, although unfortunately there were far less of them than I expected there to be. The information presented in writing and pictures at the end of the film was also well done and a good way to have the film go out on a strong and positive note. I actually had a good time with 'Just Mercy' but with a few tweaks I feel this could've been something truly special.",Just Mercy

The storyline focuses on an aspiring lawyer trying to build a clientele when he comes across a case that seems impossible. He feels he is his client's and his family's last hope...the perfect case for a young but determined lawyer. Can he save this man's life and get him off death row? This movie is directed by Destin Daniel Cretton (The Glass Castle) and stars Michael B. Jordan (Creed), Jamie Foxx (Ray), Brad Sanders (Bad Boys), Michael Harding (Uncle Frank) and Christopher Wolfe (Modern Family). The storyline for this picture is very heartfelt, compelling, educational and eye opening. I loved the depiction of the character's determination, grit and ambitions. This is a very emotional film filled with various twists and turns. I wouldn't say this was a perfect film, and there were aspects of Jordan's performance that wasn't to the quality of Foxx's, but not enough to deter it from being a good film, but enough to keep it from being a courtroom classic. In all honesty, the courtroom scenes were a bit uneven too. Nevertheless, I would strongly recommend seeing this once, as what's ultimately behind the movie is worth seeing for sure.

33,alindsay-al,A Fantastic Important Film,9,14 October 2020,"It feels like an important time to watch this film with it being Black History Month and here is my review for the film Just Mercy. The premise of the film is based on true events that sees a Civil Rights Defence Attorney aim to free a wrongly convicted man.Main Character
Michael B Jordan is seriously one of the best actors around and once again he knocks it out of the park here. He is fantastic as the defence lawyer, you truly believe that he really cares about the cases he takes on and how that makes him so different to the other lawyers shown in the film. He is just so good and I thought his presence was just really powerful in this film.Supporting Characters
Jamie Foxx plays the man convicted of the crime and he is brilliant, he conveys so much emotion and you just feel so much sympathy for him and really care about him and want to see him succeed. I mean Jordan and Foxx don't have too many scenes together but the two of them knock it out of the park here and when they are together they shine even more. The rest of the cast are great too, Brie Larson is great, Tim Blake Nelson is great, Rafe Spall is great and O'shea Jackson Jnr is great. They just add so much quality to this film and their roles feel genuine and compliment the two main performances even better.Story
The story is incredibly powerful, seeing this man really go above and beyond to try and get this man freed, who from the very beginning of the film you can pretty much tell is innocent. With this being based on a true story it didn't exactly give them much room to manoeuvre and I thought they were respectful and showed just how bad racism can be and how it can really change people's lives.Script
The script is really good, the drama is there and you feel the emotion when you are supposed to, you care about the characters and want to see them succeed in their journey. Characters are pretty layered and they range and aren't all stereotypes, in fact there are few stereotypes which helps improve the film.Style
The Style of the film does its job, it is a really gripping film, without particularly gripping things happening. There is just an intense feeling about the film that something bad can happen. Also the film flowed really nicely and despite the slower feeling was paced well. Now onto my one criticism of the film and that there are a few parts of the film that are never followed up on and feel like they didn't have to be here, also for a film involving law, there is a lack of court scenes and I think the film could have used more here.Overall
Overall, this is a fantastic film, it hits the levels necessary for a story like this and is one of those films that are really important. It is an important watch and one that I think people should find to watch.",Just Mercy

Jamie Foxx as Walter McMillan who was wrongfully convicted of murder and is on Death Row, Michael B.

While the film is mainly about the McMillan case it also covers others who were framed including that of Anthony Ray Hinton (O'Shea Jackson Jr.) who spent 30 years on Death Row before Stevenson finally won him his freedom in 2019. Stevenson has to fight against a racist sheriff and a system which will do anything to keep McMillan in prison.

We focus on one case in particular where Foxx was accused of murdering a white teen even though the majority of the evidence was provided by the testimony of a convicted killer, played Tim Blake Nelson. Even from a cursory glance at Foxx's case, Jordan sees there's no there, there. Fighting against an entrenched police department & prosecuting attorney, Jordan along w/Larson, who plays his office's manager, have an uphill battle but as want as this type of courtroom drama is, the ending is assured. Given that Hollywood really doesn't make this kind of film any more it's heartening to see up & comers like Jordan & Larson lend their talent here, w/Foxx the bedrock for decency & fair play throughout but let's be frank, we're not reinventing the wheel here but merely adding some spokes to the rims.

Michael B. Jordan and Jamie Foxx provide excellent performances for their characters, and deserve some serious awards attention for their work in this film. Both actors play the parts provided with such a grace of emotion and thought, that you will truly forget that they are simply actors on screen. The cinematography is quite good, with some truly beautiful shots and wonderful angles, that truly give the film an original and clean feel tonely. The film can be rather smart, notably with dialogue, with some truly great and provocative points. Where its flaws lie however, is in the writing of the script and its format, proving to be a bit predictable and formulaic throughout its nearly 2 and a half hour course on screen. However, the film overcomes this obstacle, and proves that even though its progression of the story may be average, the story it's telling is far from so. In the end, Just Mercy was a surprisingly emotional and thought provoking film that I won't soon forget. Jordan and Foxx are great in their roles, and I would love to see them work on screen again sometime in the future.

45,richard-1787,Moving performances and intelligent direction make this a power film,9,11 January 2020,"The story of a man unjustly accused and finally vindicated usually makes for a satisfying picture, and that is certainly true here. But there is more to this than just a good story, taken (not exactly ripped) from the news several decades ago, solid acting, and good direction. What, at least for me, make this such a deeply moving film was the unrelenting use of closeups, closeups that were not meant to flatter anyone but rather to make us see - and share - every bit of the powerful emotions these men felt as they dealt with injustice against which it seems like they were powerless to fight. Keeping the camera so close in to actors' faces requires something very old-fashioned: actors who can express their emotions with the tiniest facial moment. These actors are all capable of that, and keep it up during the entire picture. I can only imagine that the shooting sessions must have been emotionally draining. Even though they were acting, they must have felt some of the power of the emotions they were working to suggest.Why didn't I give this a 10? There is some dialogue that sounds unrealistic, and some threads that are left dangling. Why, for example, did the sheriff want the chief witness in the murder trial to place the blame on Walter? Was there some backstory there? These are minor problems, however, and will not keep you from being deeply moved by this picture.",Just Mercy
46,rannynm,A Must-See Movie Revealing How the Law Treats People of Color and Lack of Funds,10,11 January 2020,"Just Mercy is a must-see movie! It tells a great story about how the law treats people based on the color of their skin and how you may not be treated fairly if you are poor. This movie is so inspiring! Just Mercy is the perfect title because the movie helps show how people can have ""mercy"" for other human beings instead of just punishing them.Just Mercy is based on defense attorney Bryan Stevenson's memoir of the same title. The film tells stories about cases Bryan Stevenson (Michael B. Jordan) works on when he first becomes a lawyer. The main story in the movie is about a man named Walter McMillian (Jamie Foxx) who is an African-American man that is wrongfully sent to jail for a crime he didn't commit and sentenced to die. Stevenson helps McMillian appeal his case. Stevenson also works on other cases for other prisoners that are on death row. Many of the prisoners are not able to afford good lawyers and are unable to fight the law and the ""bad"" men in the town, so Bryan Stevenson, with the help of his co-worker at his business called The Equal Justice Institute, looks into their cases to help change the court's decisions.The lead characters are Walter McMillan and his lawyer Bryan Stevenson. They build a great friendship and become more like family than colleagues. All of the actors fully bring their characters to life. One of my favorite parts is when the prisoners show support for each other by banging on the bars of their jail cells with metal cups. It is also a sad part because it usually happens when one of their friends is going to be put to death; however, it shows that the prisoners are all in this together, and it helps the one going to die not feel so alone.There are different messages in this movie. The message for the prisoners is to never give up hope, but the message for the people making decisions for the prisoners is that it is good to show mercy for people even when the situation looks bad. Some of the things adults should look out for in Just Mercy are foul language and scenes when inmates are put to death. There is also a scene where a character has to remove some of his clothes (not all of them) when he visits the prison.Just Mercy is an excellent movie that could really help people learn to treat each other as humans. I rate this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18, plus adults. Reviewed by Tiana S., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

49,krocheav,Just Mercy - As expected But Good,8,25 May 2021,"For a movie based on a true story, this one felt as if too much may have been unnecessarily manipulated - seems as if 'truth' is just not exciting enough for Hollywood so needs to be re-written. This picture highlights a shocking fact, that when law and law upholders are corrupt, the whole system fails abysmally. While I accept that certain members of the police force are totally unworthy of their job, not all can be automatically thrown into this category - just as not all 'White' males can be thrown into a set genre. Movies, even as good as this one, need to present a more balanced view to be fully convincing - without simply being manipulative.Direction and screenplay come across with above-average qualities but it's the un-truthful 'additions' that reduce its power. Yes, there are many clichés to be found in this type of story but these are also to be expected, after all, what can be done with a set pattern of Crime-to-Prison-to-courtroom situations? Not sure the 2Hr 15m running time was all that necessary as it tended to extend some scenes beyond their full potential.Most all performances were in top form, with much sensitivity injected into a broad range of characters. The multi-talented Brie Larson (Basmati Blues) is impressive in a somewhat background but integral role, with Michael B. Jordan and Jamie Foxx, breathing convincing life into their strong Lawyer/Accused characters - keeping the dramatic situations in sharp focus. It's a good looking production with handsome cinematography helping to bring home its strong plea for racial justice within a sometimes broken system and hopefully, changed for the better by these earnest efforts.",Just Mercy
50,martimusross,Brilliant Acting But A Muddled Script,6,24 October 2020,"Just MercyThis movie, despite the fabulous acting had significant problems from the start.Bryan declared twice in the first ten minutes he became a lawyer to help people, I choked, we all know lawyers are legal prostitutes who take the side of who they represent whether innocent or guilty, to suggest Bryan is an evangelical lawyer fighting for the truth and the light is absurd. Bryan would be a one off if he is such a man and does not represent lawyers as a class.We then had a scene where he was strip searched and the movie implied this was all but ""violation"" get real it was nothing more then you might be asked to do at the airport going to the Canaries.To fight for an innocent man is a brilliant aim to merely remove a prisoner from one list to another is a matter of viewpoint. America has two death sentences, execution and death by natural causes during incarceration without the possibility of parole and no medical intervention.We then had the same scene repeated from Queen & Slim and The Hate You Give where a black driver back-sass' a police officer with a loaded gun, I have been stopped numerous times and I would never do this.Apart from this the race issues were handled brilliantly with the obvious bias and discrimination.The movie then sought to dwell on the process of execution, this may have been revolting but it did not elicit sympathy as behind every execution lays a murdered innocent. Also I would argue it is more humane to end a life than rot in jail for the rest of your life.Overall I'm not really sure what the movie was about or what it was advocating apart from the wrong man should never be in prison which is blindingly obvious. If it was the story of a naive lawyer wising up to the realities of the American justice system then it was badly handled. As a personal biopic it was of interest but only of a limited nature.",Just Mercy
51,MR_Heraclius,Great movie wonderful story!!,9,18 March 2020,Was so hard to watch the police chief and the DA assume that just because you r black u r guilty. Was so impressed by the young black attorney--his drive even though he was subjected to brutality himself. Makes u look at death row in a very different light to be sure that those whom r there r truly guilty. Highly recommend this movie.,Just Mercy

55,jon.h.ochiai,"We All Must Have ""Mercy""",9,17 January 2020,"In Writer and Director Destin Daniel Cretton's ""Just Mercy"" the impassioned Michael B. Jordan as attorney Bryan Stevenson reminds the Alabama Court Jury, ""We all need grace. We all need mercy..."" There's profound wisdom and compassion in Bryan's words. The screenplay by Destin and Andrew Lawrence was based on Bryan Stevenson's book ""Just Mercy"". So this represents part of our history.In 1991, Bryan defends Walter McMillian, brilliantly played by Jamie Foxx, convicted of murdering the 18 year-old white woman in a liquor store, sentenced to death by the electric chair. Walter is innocent. He was with his family at the time of the murder. Given the coerced testimony of the lifelong criminal Ralph Myers, played by sympathetically damaged Tim Blake Nelson, Walter is placed on Death Row, even before he's charged. WTF?Turns out that Walter had an affair a couple years ago with a white woman. His wife Minnie, played by strong Karan Kendrick, had forgiven for his transgressions. Apparently, not the Alabama Police. So basically, Walter is the innocent man sentenced to die, because he's Black. That was 1991. That's 30 years ago, not that long ago. That's the relevant poignancy of Destin's ""Just Mercy"". Through the powerful and compassionate work of Michael B. and Jamie, we get that ""We all need mercy."" Perhaps, now in 2020 more than ever before.As a law intern in Alabama, Michael B.'s Ryan worked with a Death Row inmate, who was as old as him. The young Black man was so grateful that his stay of execution extended for a year. He's essentially a kid. That lands with Ryan. That lands with us.After graduating from Harvard Law School and passing the Bar, Ryan accepts the position in Alabama as a public defender providing legal service for those in need, which is primarily a lot of poor African Americans. Ryan works for idealist office manager Eva Ansley, played by fiery smart Brie Larson. They start the Equal Justice Initiative.Ryan meets with Jamie's Walter in prison, offering to appeal his case. Upfront Walter tells naïve Ryan, ""Down here you're guilty from the moment you're born."" Ryan gets that sad indictment given his own experience of racial prejudice.That arcane mindset even threatens Eva's family. In the quiet, Eva tells Ryan that she wants her little boy to know that she wasn't going to back down ""just because she was scared of some bigot."" That might be the heart and soul of ""Just Mercy"". There's nobility in acting out of justice, acting out of mercy.The very soul of ""Just Mercy"" is the profound screen partnership of Michael B. Jordan and Jamie Fox. I love Michael B. He possesses power in his words, in his silence. He has the amazing gift of letting us know what goes on inside through his gaze. We get it when he witnesses the electrocution of one of his clients. His closing court room speech expresses his and our very own humanity. Michael B. is something special.So is Jamie Foxx in the supporting role of Walter. Foxx embodies the authentic suffering and nobility in Walter. It's heartbreaking watching Walter ask his son John to stand down in court, fearing for his safety. His eloquent power reveals as he weeps in his jail cell. It's a shame Jamie wasn't nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar.All that being said, Destin, Michael B., and Jamie ask us to look at ourselves: Do we have mercy? Do we have grace? Yeah, at times Destin and Andrew's narrative is very linear. That might be the effect of retelling history. Still, ""Just Mercy"" too is something special in that it makes us look at our own humanity. It asks, ""How can I make a difference?"" That might have been the authentic spirit of Ryan Stevenson. A very noble and good thing. Just saying.",Just Mercy

57,tm-sheehan,A Great film egregiously ignored by Oscar,10,24 January 2020,"My Review - Just Mercy
My Rating 10/10
I've just seen one of the Best movies of 2019/20 and I'm angry and disappointed that Just Mercy has so mercilessly been snubbed by all the major Cinema Awards.
No Golden Globe nominations no Academy Award nominations just 2 prestigious African-American Film Critics Association wins for Jamie Fox Best Supporting Actor and AAFCA Award Top 10 Films and 3 Black Reel 2020 Nominations.What could possibly be the reason such a compelling and true story set in 1987 Alabama about a young Afro American lawyer determined to try and help a wrongly accused black man facing the electric chair and sent to Death Row even before his trial?
Is it poor acting by Michael B Jordan as Bryan Stevenson the idealistic rookie lawyer taking on a David & Goliath case? It certainly is not , Michael B Jordan is superb in this difficult role.
At the premier I read there were audible sobs rumbling through the theater. By the time the credits rolled, the crowd was on its feet. After the premiere, Deadline declared that Just Mercy had ignited ""Oscar talk."" Variety hailed Jordan's restrained performance as ""quietly amazing,"" and IndieWire wrote that Jordan ""practically carries the movie across the finish line by himself.""
Cut to Monday morning when the 92nd Annual Academy Awards nominations were announced, and Jordan's name was left off the ballot. Not only wasn't Jordan nominated for a Best Actor nomination he wasn't even in the conversation for any major awards leading up to the announcement.
Jamie Fox also gives a career best performance as Walter McMillan the unjustly set up scape goat to a murder charge that the red neck Sherrif Tate (Michael Harding ) has moved Heaven and earth to be seen to get a conviction Fox should have been certain of a Best Supporting Actor nomination.
When asked about the backlash, Jamie, who's new movie Just Mercy didn't land any nods, told NME: 'What we want to do is keep doing movies. We don't do movies for awards.'
Just Mercy, which Jamie revealed has been nominated for the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People Image Award.I can only theorise that the Academy doesn't like films that fail promote the U.S.A. In a positive light ,or surely there couldn't be a White Only bias or could there?
We've already seen a bias this year from the Academy towards Women Directors and by the obvious snub of this fine film and it's actors it does certainly look like White bias to many including me.
Looking at all the major nominations there are at least 2 movies and 2 actors that should have fallen behind Just Mercy and in the Best film category a South Korean film Parasite has 2 Best Picture nominations Best International Film ?
Parasite may be a fantastic film but why 2 nominations when you have Just Mercy with none?
This movie which is set in very recent history and these injustices are still occurring in parts of America that may seem enlightened but still carry out the Death Sentence and treat the poor ,disenfranchised coloured communities with contempt made me very thankful to live in Australia even with our many problems.
Of course we have problems with black deaths in custody greater numbers of black youths arrested than white but we have a very different and fairer justice system than the U.S.A. we also have strong gun laws , no Death Penalty and hopefully events depicted in this film couldn't occur in Australia.",Just Mercy
58,brankovranjkovic,Just Mercy - Corrupt and unequal justice system to the poor and minorities,9,22 January 2020,"Intense courtroom drama based on actual events and based on the book by the same name, about a trainee lawyer who moves to Alabama to devote his career to defending the unfortunate community, the people who were not able to afforded appropriate defence (these were mostly black).His first case was that of Walter McMillian, who was sentenced to death for the murder of a white woman. However, all the evidence showed that he was innocent, and it was more suspicious that the only testimony against him came from another criminal who was also on death row.This film shows how corrupt the justice system can be, the poor and minorities are too often not treated equally. The post credit scenes tell you what happened to each of the people featured.Highly recommended.",Just Mercy
59,MrDHWong,"A sincere, determined look into the American justice system told with a gripping sense of drama",8,23 January 2020,"Just Mercy is a legal drama film co-written and directed by Destin Daniel Cretton (Short Term 12, The Glass Castle) based on the 2014 memoir ""Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption"" by Bryan Stevenson. Starring Jamie Foxx, Michael B Jordan, and Brie Larson, it is a sincere, determined look into the American justice system told with a gripping sense of drama.In 1989, young Harvard graduate lawyer Bryan Stevenson (Michael B. Jordan) sets up a firm in Alabama with the intention of bringing justice to those who are unable to afford proper legal representation. Aiding Bryan in this pursuit is Eva Ansley (Brie Larson), a young woman who shares his sense of moral responsibility. While talking with a number of prisoners on death row, Bryan's attention is attracted to that of Walter McMillian (Jamie Foxx), an African-American man convicted of murdering a white teenage girl three years earlier. After some in-depth research, Bryan is convinced that the evidence against Walter is not strong enough, and decides to fight for Walter's freedom.With a strong sense of justice emanating throughout the story, Just Mercy succeeds both as an entertaining legal drama and as a sad commentary on the poor state of America's penal system. The film brings to light how so many people, primarily African-Americans, have been wrongfully placed on death row for either menial crimes or even something that cannot be helped like their physical appearance. It is mentioned that one in nine people in America placed on death row have been proven innocent either before or after they have been executed, which is quite a horrifying statistic to think about.Director/co-writer Destin Daniel Cretton shows the familial bond within the African-American population of Alabama, proving how they will all stick together in the face of injustice. As we hear in Walter's statement ""...you're guilty from the moment you're born"", we certainly get the sense that they are constantly living in fear that their every action could be called into question and may even land them on death row. However, while it is true that racism is still considered a prevalent issue in the southern US states, I feel that the film does exaggerate some of the white people's characteristics. It just seems that over 95% of the white characters depicted in the film are racist against black people for no other reason other than their skin colour, which comes across as a highly broad generalisation and feels as though they are trying to guilt trip all white people who may be watching. At the same time though, there is something to be admired in Cretton's ability to adopt the mindset of an innocent death row inmate with the ever-looming sense of dread that their date of execution is coming soon.Michael B. Jordan gives his most mature, heartfelt performance to date as real-life lawyer Bryan Stevenson. From the very beginning, the audience understands this man's moral duty to do what is right and stand up for those who struggle to do so on their own. He and Brie Larson have solid on-screen chemistry and it makes me hope to see the two of them acting off one another again in a future project. But the true standout is Jamie Foxx, who once again proves his versatility as a actor, bringing a heartfelt backbone to several of the film's most dramatic scenes. You can really feel the sense of trauma and fear in his character just by observing his face during his moments of desperation.In conclusion, films like this are meant to serve as a reminder that in the face of injustice, there are still genuinely good people out there willing to do the right thing and stand up for those who may not be able to. Even though it may be an uphill battle for some, it is nice to know that the sense of morality remains in people like Bryan Stevenson.I rate it 8/10",Just Mercy

The Story itself is not new and it is really shocking that this is more relevant than ever. The acting was superb. One of the best Ensemble Performances of the year. First of all Michael B. Jordan who more and more solidizes himself as one of the finest actors of his Generation. We got Jamie Foxx' best Performance in YEARS.... probably since ""Ray""/Collateral. He was really stunning. So much was going on just with his expressions. He really deserved more appluase for this role. Also great Performances by Rob Morgan who is criminally underrated, epsecially in this Performance and Tim Blake Nelson. Brie Larson had her Moments but was generally underused. The direction and screenplay were good, especially when it came to character developement where it emphasized. It was thrilling and captivating. The score was good as was the editing.

61,cliftonofun,"An important story, well told",7,26 January 2020,"First things first: I love this book, and I love Bryan Stevenson. So I was not walking into this film cold. In fact, I found myself wondering how they could possibly adapt a memoir that transcends many years and cases without becoming a confusing legal mashup with way too much talking. The good news is that the filmmakers brilliantly adapted the story: they zero in on a few key cases and the initial years of the Equal Justice Initiative, which provides a meaningful beginning/middle/end. They also got amazing performances from everyone involved, most notably Jordan and Fox. In short, it works better than I expected. That said, they still fell into the trap of characters providing exposition via dialogue and the story feeling a bit too much like previous legal dramas - earnest young lawyer, suspicious community, triumphant verdict (and some familiar Hollywood approaches to race, as well). Here's the thing, though: this story is actually true. Between that knowledge and the performances, I found myself pretty emotionally impacted, even if there were some flaws. I also got to see the way my 10 year old daughter reacted to the story, which reminded me that we need WAY more stories like this about people who are making the world a better place, one day at a time.",Just Mercy

66,ethanbresnett,An absolutely heartbreaking piece of cinema,9,3 October 2020,"Just Mercy is such a powerful, crushing, rage inducing film. Telling the story of the wrongly accused Walter McMillan and the work of his heroic lawyer Bryan Stevenson, who attempts to ensure that justice reigns.The subject matter really is harrowing and devastating, and all the more poignant and significant given the current reminder that in many ways, very little has changed in the justice system for African Americans. I felt like I was on the verge of tears for near enough the entire film. The way that this story was told was so intimate, so heartfelt, so vivid, and the fact that it is a true story is so shocking that its impossible not to feel very deeply affected by this film.Just Mercy is so forceful and powerful with its message. Such a strong message and one that needs to be shouted from the rooftops now more than ever. A message highlighting the racial bias in the American justice system, as well as the inhumanity of the death penalty. What enabled this message to be so clear and powerful were the fantastic performances. Jaime Foxx was astoundingly good, perhaps the best performance I've seen from him. Michael B Jordan was fantastic too, being a huge amount of emotion to his performance. Both played their characters with an incredible amount of understanding, of sympathy, of depth, and it was amazing to watch. The supporting cast were all incredible too, with Rafe Spall and Brie Larson being two of the standouts.Just Mercy is a really special film, and magnificently well done. Its a great piece of cinema when considering more technical aspects like the direction, the score, the performances etc, but really the story and the way it is told is the triumph of this film. Its such a visceral experience that like I've said, will really touch you.This film needs to be essential watching for everyone. It is heartbreaking, devastating and poignant, and delivers a crucial message and feeling which will stay with you for some time.",Just Mercy

68,akcenat,"Real-life slow pace horror story that we, unfortunately, already seen so many times before",6,21 March 2020,"Based on the true story of Civil Rights Lawyer Bryan Stevenson, ""Just Mercy"" actually is showing the poor state of social relations in the US, no matter the theme of the movie is fight against the death penalty. Unfortunately, almost everything in this movie we already seen in so many other similar films, and that is why I become bored around 43 min of its runtime. As a result, ""Just Mercy"" suffers a lot from its slight pacing which makes you to start feel the movie as a quite long. The score and cinematography are restrained, comforting the story rather than adding anything significant, but on the whole that is OK, given that ""Just Mercy"" is Stevenson's story with some quite emotionally powerful ending which more than makes up for a very long runtime, average cinematography and slow pace rhythm. Overall, ""Just Mercy"" is worth a watch and a movie that is impossible to ignore, but everything here is just too familiar and the film simply can't put a fresh spin on its subject.Rating: 6+/7",Just Mercy

70,steiner-sam,Very emotionally moving,8,17 June 2021,"The film is set in Montgomery, Alabama, in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It is ""based on a true story,"" which is a step closer to the truth than ""inspired by a true story.""Bryan Stevenson (Michael B. Jordan) is a young African-American Harvard Law School graduate from the North who decides to go to Alabama to do legal work for men on death row who have no legal resources. He founds the Equal Justice Initiative together with Eva Ansley (Brie Larson) and begins interviews with men on death row.African American Walter ""Johnnie D"" McMillian (Jamie Foxx) is on death row for murdering an 18-year-old white woman. He was convicted primarily on one man's evidence--a white career criminal, Ralph Myers (Tim Blake Nelson). Stevenson becomes convinced that McMillian is innocent of the murder, and Myers' testimony had essentially been extorted by the sheriff. Testimony of many witnesses that McMillian was elsewhere at the time of the murder was ignored. McMillian was a target of the white community because he was known to have had an affair with a white woman.The film recounts the many challenges faced by Stevenson in fighting for McMillian. We encounter other death row inmates, one of whose execution profoundly impacts Stevenson. Although Myers eventually recants his original testimony at trial, the circuit court decides the recantation was perjury. Finally, after Stevenson gains great publicity through a segment on ""60 Minutes,"" the Alabama Supreme Court orders a new trial. Ultimately McMillian has the charges dropped.This is not a fast-paced movie, but I found it to be very emotionally moving.

Director: Destin Daniel Cretton
Starring: Michael b Jordan, Jamie Foxx, Brie Larson, Tim Blake Nelson, Rafe Spall etc
Overall rating 96/100Wow what a phenomenal movie just mercy was. Taking me through an emotional rollercoaster and really spreading an important message to society, lets talk about this more in detail.First of all, the film managed to create a very uncomfortable tone and bought attention to some sensitive issues in today's society. Wow this film did a great job at creating such an uncomfortable atmosphere as you saw innocent black men and women being stopped and searched by the police for doing nothing, and having close ups of guns being pointed to their heads really added to the impact of the scenes and increased your anger at the flaws in the police and the justice system, this film tackled police racism and lack of trial or support for black people in poorer communities, they tackled it in a impactful and sensitive way to really make you connect with these characters and is an eye opener for people who think that racism still doesn't exist.Next the film went into great amount of detail about different experiences that people have on death row, and the character depth within the film was fantastic. Yes, the films focus was on Michael and Jamie's character, but they also had a good amount of time on other prisoners on death row and how they were explaining their innocence. I just loved that instead of being one happy story they also went deeply into the more negative experiences that can happen to people, so this was really interesting and educational. And also, the amount of depth into people's reasoning for their actions was really appreciated and made for a much more compelling story instead of having bland and generic characters there was characters that you connected to and learned to love or hate.My only two slight nit-picks that made this film not quite perfect would be its predictability and it needing more character development at the beginning. Yes, you could tell what was going to happen at the end throughout the movie, which might be a turn off to some more casual moviegoers, but they took you on such a fantastic journey that this didn't bother me to much. My only slight problem with the plot and narrative at the beginning, would be that I would have liked a slight bit more character development with Jamie Foxx's character at the beginning. The film went straight into his character getting arrested, this was fine as it made you intrigued straight away but I would of liked it if there was more background on his character before this happened but that was my only slight issue with the film.Next the films emotional weight and script was fantastic. Wow this film was an emotional rollercoaster. To see the mental agony the inmates on death row have to go through knowing they are going to die despite some of them being innocent was heart-breaking to see, and to see Jamie Foxx's character finally getting the freedom he deserved was incredibly emotional to watch, as you connected so much with his character you felt as if you were in the court room with him. The script as well was phenomenal, the intelligent comments about todays society and the racism that still occurs was powerful to listen to and to watch, with some incredible speeches in front of the court and excellently delivered by both Michael and Brie Larson.Next the performances, likeable lead and chemistry between the characters was fantastic. The performances and the delivery of these performances really held this movie together. Michael B Jordan was phenomenal. His powerful delivery with his speeches was fantastic, his emotional complexity was fantastic, and he just felt very genuine and authentic when watching, it also helped that his character was incredibly likeable, as his passion for wanting to do the right thing and saving innocent people was clear and you really supported his actions throughout. Jamie Foxx was phenomenal, once again showing acting versatility, with his heartbreakingly realistic performance making you really connect with his pain and making the audience support him throughout. And also, to Brie Larson who did a great job, showing kindness, warmth and a very passionate performance making the audience believe she genuinely cared about all her clients. And the chemistry between all three of these characters was off the charts as well, making every time they were on screen together enjoyable and impactful.And my final big positive would be the films powerful message. This movie dealt with a lot of big issues still in todays society in such an impactful way. And taught me at least that you should fight for what you believe in and fight for the equality and fair judgement of everyone in society.Overall Just mercy is a truly powerful movie. Which is fantastically acted, emotionally investing and has a powerful message that everyone in society needs to know about.",Just Mercy

75,movieman6-413-929510,Just Mercy shows how corruption and racism can influence a court case.,7,18 January 2020,"Just Mercy is a new drama directed and partly written by Destin Daniel Cretton, the director of The Glass Castle. The film is based on the true story of lawyer Bryan Stevenson.The film is about the young lawyer Bryan Stevenson (Michael B. Jordan), who tries to bring justice to the people who are struggling financially. Bryan travels to Alabama to support local lawyer Eva Ansley (Brie Larson). The two try to help local prisoners and end up with Walter ""Johnny D."" McMillian (Jamie Fox). He was sentenced to death in 1987 for being charged with the murder of an 18-year-old girl. Bryan knows how to find a lot to prove Johnny D. his innocence, but only has to see criminal Ralph Myers (Tim Blake Nelson) to talk about the truth. Without this testimony, he does not stand a chance against the corrupt racist state. In this way Bryan gradually becomes a symbol for the community of Johnny D. in the fight against the state.This film is a good response to how something such as corruption or racism can affect a court case and get stuck innocent people and actually be killed innocently by the death penalty. The pace of the film can sometimes seem a bit long-winded, but this is mainly due to all the setbacks that the characters experience thanks to the corruption of the state. Despite the lengthyness that the films can sometimes have, the film also has a compelling story.The acting work is well done by the cast Jamie Fox and Michael B. Jordan play well together in this film as a duo that Jamie Fox's innocence is trying to prove his character, but are constantly knocked down by corrupt racist opponents.

It's not always the easiest watch, but with enormous passion, it provides memorable and compelling drama throughout.From Destin Daniel Cretton (director of the extraordinary Short Term 12), Just Mercy is filled to the brim with the same emotional passion and frank human drama that the director has delivered so spectacularly in the past. This film may not be quite as affecting as Short Term 12, but it's the frank nature of the drama that really hits home here.The movie gets off to a slow start, characterised by what is often frustratingly one-dimensional drama over the course of the first hour. Just Mercy is not the great character drama that Short Term 12 is, and with its more engaging legal themes, it never really hits a sweet spot between character drama and legal drama.However, the film really comes into its own in the latter half, as the tone takes a significant shift to powerful dramatic gravitas, showcasing an overwhelming and devastating perspective on true injustice, as we see the draconian and inhumane sentences imposed on those convicted without due legal process.In tandem with that tonal shift, the screenplay also begins to place its eggs firmly in the basket of legal drama. The rather one-note character drama of the earlier stages takes a back seat for what turns out to be the better of the story and the film's core message, as a gripping legal story opens up the door for the film's scathing indictment on institutional racism, corruption and oppression.Cretton delivers that message in powerful fashion throughout, and his passionate direction makes it a topic that really gets under your skin throughout, bringing home the devastating and almost inescapable reality of a system that works against people from the moment they're born, with no respite for the innocent.The film is also particularly striking in the way it presents its time period. The story is set in the late 1980s-early 1990s, but Cretton ingeniously makes little noise about that, instead telling the story in a style that makes it seem entirely like the most violent years of the 1960s, or even the 19th Century at moments.It's a subtle and clever way of further driving home the message that this kind of injustice persists right up to this day, and every time when you remember that you're watching a true story that happened as recently as the 1990s, it's really quite shocking to think about.Just Mercy is undoubtedly at its strongest in its heaviest moments, and with a captivating and impassioned lead performance from Michael B. Jordan, those moments are not without immense emotional power. There are times when the film can stray into slightly cheesy territory - although only very briefly - and there are also moments in the first act that pale in comparison to what the film becomes later on.Overall, however, there's no denying that Just Mercy is a deeply powerful drama that overcomes a mixed start to deliver an affecting and infuriating story, riveting legal drama and an impassioned and scathing attack on the horrors of a corrupt institution that still exists today.",Just Mercy

Firstly, the plot is exciting, especially when you realised that it's based on true story. I really worried about fate of mr. McMillan. It shows all problems in justice system, problems with racism, etc. Secondly, the cast is also great, Michael B. Jordan looks similar to his prototype, and I can see all his internal experience on his face. Jamie Foxx is wonderful too, I cried with him at the end. Others are good too.
So, it's wonderful film about justice.",Just Mercy

85,Lewis_Heather787,Totally shocking !,8,1 January 2020,"I went into this film with no expectations at all, didn't even really know what the film was about, just saw the really exciting cast and I was in. Nothing would have prepared me for the totally shocking.....True Story......that was told in this film, it has stayed with me ever since I watched it.I'm not sure I know enough words in the English dictionary to describe the total disbelief in the whole story and journey of Walter McMillian and Bryan Stevenson played by Jamie Foxx and Michael B Jordan respectively. Needless to say that I had never heard of the central case of this film involving Mr McMillian nor the incredible work of Mr Stevenson and his organisation. I think it definitely benefited my viewing experience because I really had no idea what was going to happen.Wow what an emotional roller coaster in many respects. I have complete and utter disgust with the pathetic case that was brought against Walter McMillian in the first place...........basically the police needed to desperately catch someone so they intimidated another death row inmate to testify against an innocent man, so he could get a reduced sentence. Then there is the small fact of not using the witness accounts of black people who would prove Mr McMillian's innocence.........nor have any black people on the jury??!?!?!?Then there is the other side of the emotion.............from disgust and almost anger, to just outright sadness...........this film is deeply horrifying and sad due to the nature of the subject matter...........the scene when Herbert Richardson gets executed, is a huge emotional punch to the gut..........it must also be said that the end credits are also just as educationally horrifying.............thankfully there are some silver linings!!All of this going through my head is obviously due to the film being good........oh yeah did I not mention that..............why is the Imdb score so low???? The directing is solid but nothing mind blowing........it didn't need to be!!! The acting in this film is what just adds that extra special touch to elevate the film from good to great, for me!! Michael B Jordan, Jamie Foxx, Brie Larson all of whom are just great in the film..............no more to say!!!!!Overall I am just shocked by the story, it took my breath away!! Being from the UK where the death penalty has not been accepted for quite some time..........it is completely dumfounding why its still used and accepted in the US?!?! Yeah those statistics at the end is almost vomit inducing. 80% out of 100 its a very good film highly recommend.............people need to hear this story, peoples eyes need to be opened.",Just Mercy

87,MJB784,Just Mercy is just ok,5,14 January 2020,I didn't think there was much story or suspense to it. It's about a lumberjack accused of murdering a woman just because he's black and they don't know who the killer is and the lawyer is newly graduated from law school. I found it mostly boring because there wasn't any explanation for why she was murdered or fingerprint evidence or any weapon. Richard Jewell was a more involving story about a victim accused of violence.,Just Mercy

90,Jared_Andrews,Powerful Story but Movie Falls a bit Flat,6,10 July 2020,"With source material (based on a true story) this compelling, a cast this littered with star power and legitimate award-winning talent, and a respected director (who directed ""Short Term 12""), this movie should be been an unstoppable smashing success. It should have been GREAT. It should have won Oscars. But it didn't. It didn't because something is missing.
What exactly is missing is a bit hard to put a finger on. For some reason or another, the movie simply misses the mark. Part of the explanation involves the approach the film takes. Filmmakers clearly had seen other successful true stories that let the events speak loudly rather than attempt to falsely drum up intensity. They trusted that the story would be enough. And it is unquestionably an engrossing story, but that does not necessarily mean the movie will reach the heights that it should. Ultimately, the miscalculations of tone and lack of a visceral kick lead to the movie falling a notch below understated and landing somewhere in the dull zone.
I love Michael B. Jordan. He's one of the most talented actors of his generation and has been one of my favorites for the past decade. That's why I was disappointed by his performance here. He's a bit flat. In all the scenes featuring lingering shots of his face as he smolders with anger and sadness, I see very little depth. These sorts of shots appear in the film many times, and each time I kept searching for the layers of emotion in eyes and on his face, only to realize that there isn't much there. His emoting contrasts greatly with the instances when Jamie Fox and Rob Morgan have their opportunities. The deliver an emotional wallop whenever given the chance. Their towering displays make it all the more obvious that Jordan did not perform on their level in this movie.
It pains me to type this. I know in my heart that Michael B. Jordan will once again reach his top form in one of his upcoming movies. He's far too talented not to do so.
Overall, the movie needed a little bit more. The dialogue needed to be a bit sharper, for one. The story building also left a bit to be desired. In no way am I suggested that this is a bad movie - it's not. Actually, it's a pretty good one. Unfortunately, it had the potential to be so much more.",Just Mercy
91,blrnani,"Not a great film, but...",6,28 June 2020,"... a very valuable one in that it shows how injustice (such as but not only racism) can become institutionalised within a society. It starts with a precipitate rush to judgement, based on bigoted attitudes, and spreads ever more perfidiously as people seek to defend the original decision and cover up errors made, in a process that can become quite horrific and destroy the fabric of the society they are misguidedly attempting to 'protect'.
In this film (spoiler alert), belated justice hinged on two people eventually being moved by their consciences. But justice should never have to depend on that!PS: if they really wanted to force the issue on capital punishment, they could've shown the execution of Richardson. It would've moved the film into the realm of 'horror story', but aren't films without mayhem or ghouls, like ""Room"" and ""Gone Girl"", nevertheless horror stories anyway?",Just Mercy
92,csm-78119,Earnest telling of an inspirational true story,7,26 January 2020,This is an intelligent film that takes the time to tell the tale of the fight for justice in an unjust system. Strong central performance by Michael Jordan as the campaigning lawyer well supported by an excellent cast. It does the job in terms of highlighting flaws in the US justice system and is a timely reminder to all who believe in justice that we shouldn't take it for granted and that ultimately the rule of law is one of the essential requirements that separates democracy from tyranny. We should remember that in the uk as well when politicians continue to degrade and underfund our own justice system!,Just Mercy
93,Breumaster,The Banality of Institutional Racism,9,27 May 2020,"It is a low down shame how officials can install a system of institutional racism for a long period of time. Cases like them of Walter McMillian show up how bad that can be - and really was. Since the 60s many things happened and black and white children go to school together as normal, but this movie - which happens to be dramatized from real events - shows up that racism can be felt as normal, even from people which would deny it, when they realize the shame it is. This movie is a great example of what shouldn't happen in real life. Beside being a critic of death penalty, I would recommend this movie to a grown up, empathic audience.",Just Mercy
94,jkt2006,"Brilliant movie and story, and shocking!!",8,17 September 2020,"What a movie!! I could not move an inch since 15 mins into it. Based on a true story. Brilliant direction, script and performances by all. It is shocking to know what has been happening to Black folks al these years in US. Actually I just got to discover that Black people were not allowed to vote until 1980s, that's like recently, right? in the democratic USA. It is sad they still have to fight for their rights. The movie shook me up from the inside. If anyone says or feels privileged because they are a given colour of skin and think they are superior in whatever way(again because of color of skin that runs like a few nano mms ??) watch this movie. It is shameful what the protagonist and the sufferer has to go through in a ""democracy"". Sad indeed!!",Just Mercy
95,MovieBuff11732,One Of The Best Court Films In A While,9,21 January 2020,"Just Mercy is about a lower coming fresh out of law school and he wants to make the world a better place. He starts with this man that has been charged with murder and most people know he isn't guilty but many people want him to be.Just Mercy might be the best film based on law since A Few Good Men in the 90s. The reason why I think is because it brought back that feeling of a-ha when they show some evidence to someone. This film took that to a whole different level. It showed you what he was then they had to get past another goal. It really made you mad sometimes or maybe even get a little misty eyed. This film had many great scenes that had you happy at one part then made shedding tears at the end. The only thing I didn't really find to fond of the story was the first act. It didn't really start off with the bang you wanted it to. You might even say it was a little slow. That is the only problem I had with this film. The acting was outstanding. I don't know why Michael B. Jordan didn't get an Oscar nomination for this film. I guess there might be too many good performances this year. Jamie Fox also had really great performance. Brie Larson had a good one too. I guess I just don't really like her in the MCU because all of the films that I have saw with her in it that isn't in the MCU I have liked. I thought this film felt a little like Shawshank Redemption. The sad thing is this film is a true story and Shawshank Redemption wasn't. That is why this film could come out as scary to some people. Just like Dark Waters was.Overall, Just Mercy was a great film I would recommend to anyone.",Just Mercy
96,Guanche48,GREAT MOVIE!,9,4 October 2021,"Very good movie, detailed and perfectly edited. Also very frustrating, always the same, those who believe they are powerful are always the ones who disgust the most, but if it were someone from their own family, another story would sing.What hurts me the most is that lawyers have, even today, to fight so hard for justice, it is incredible how racism and poverty degrade ... and then? You have no rights?There should be more lawyers like Bryan Stevenson, and it's a shame to have to say it out loud.",Just Mercy

98,Sasha_Lauren,Hopelessness is the enemy of justice,8,23 May 2020,"This film, (loosely based on a true story), is about racial injustice and the horrific American criminal justice system that might as well drop 'justice' in the trash, pour it down the sewer, set it aflame on a skewer since the nature of the game is all about priviledge, protection, and power, not truth - and certainly not mercy - in so many cases it boggles the mind and pierces the heart.Michael B. Jordan plays young Harvard lawyer Bryan Stevenson who moves to Alabama to defend men wrongly condemned on death row. Jordon's performance is rooted in Stevenson's quiet dedication to do the right thing, for all the right reasons. Jamie Foxx is convincing as Walter McMillian, (aka, Johnny D.), who was sentenced to death for the murder of a white teenager without a shread of solid evidence. Tim Blake Nelson is terrific as Ralph Meyer, a criminal forced through fear into giving false testimony as the only witness against Johnny D.A bit long and sentimental, this excellent screenplay broke my heart. I cannot remember crying more through the course of a movie in recent years. I recommend this film.",Just Mercy
99,jordyntsmith,A Must Watch in an Era of Social Reform,7,25 June 2020,"It is an excellent story of the systemic problems of the justice system in America, issues which still persist in some degree today. The movie does more than just address racism though, it addresses justice issues in policing, and the problems with the death sentence in the United States. One of the strong positives of this movie is how it addresses racism from the minority perspective rather than the white perspective as many movies are prone to do.
I think the only negative I can point out is how the movie was slow at times.",Just Mercy
100,Rino_Bortone,INSPIRING,9,9 February 2020,"Frustrating, brilliant, catchy and much more would serve to describe this film. Nothing that we have not already seen or themes that we have not already heard, but this is another story, another opportunity to understand the facts of slander and infamy perpetrated on people who have suffered throughout their lives. Film directed with simplicity, capturing every nuance, excelling in the shots; also excellent photography that exploits colors depending on the context and therefore depending on what is treated in the dialogues. Foxx, Jordan and Larson offer a memorable and above all respectful performance of their characters, characterized by brush and contextualized for good depending on the era where all this is done. Few ambitions perhaps and maybe it could offer something more, but a film worthy of being among the best of the genre. Inspiring.",Just Mercy
101,contactmaz,Very weak film with mediocre acting,3,19 March 2020,"Neither thought-provoking nor powerful. We've seen these types of films before and this is nothing new. Jordan's acting was very weak and wimpy. At times, I wondered how he could be heard in a courtroom. We all know about institutional racism in a corrupt American legal system and basically, this film didn't live up to the build-up it was given. No stellar or solid performances by anyone (especially Jordan) and it just didn't have any of that powerful energy that was needed to make this film emotional.",Just Mercy
102,soulexpress,"No, it's not anti-white. And it's also NOT the best movie of the last ten years.",7,19 January 2020,"I'm guessing many of the negative reviews are from the same right-wingers who praised RICHARD JEWELL for ""owning the libtards."" Clearly, they only approve of criticizing the criminal justice system when it's a white guy being screwed.My reaction to JUST MERCY was similar to how I reacted to RICHARD JEWELL. It's a good movie about a story that deserved to be told, but big chunks of it felt fake to me. That's OK, though, as I've come to expect that from any movie ""based on a true story.""JUST MERCY benefits from a strong cast and a decent (though hardly brilliant) script. I'm glad I saw it, but I'm also glad that I entered the theater without a political agenda. This allowed me to judge the film strictly on its merits. In that regard, it deserves neither the 1-star nor the 10-star reviews that it received here.",Just Mercy
103,hpcmakeup,Just too slow,5,21 December 2019,"Maybe a different director could have saved this movie. The story is interesting, the acting is good but the pace is so slow. By the time the courtroom scenes happen my husband was completely checked out. There is never any real dramatic music or quicker paced scenes...everything is pretty monotone, with bland scenery and really boring wardrobe. I would have liked someone to have a personality, a little humor, interesting music...anything!!! It's unfortunate because the last 10 minutes are the highlight of the film but most probably won't make it to the end.",Just Mercy
104,PaxtonMalloy,You have seen that movie but it will still move you,7,3 May 2020,"First of let me get two things out of the way. There can never be enough movies against the death penalty. There can never be enough movies against racism. That being said you have already seen that movie and not just once. So from a story and directorial perspective there isn't really anything new. It will go to all of the usual steps that this subgenre has presented before. But even though it is always great when you put a new twist or perspective on something there is still nothing wrong presenting a story that is worth telling in a way that has to be proven successful. You will still be moved and there is particular one barbaric scene that will grab you but see for yourself.I have been a fan of MIchael B. Jordan since his ""Friday Night Lights"" Days and even from ""The Wire"". He is good here but I noticed a familiar pattern here. He likes to act very small. He delivers emotions mostly through his eyes and that makes his acting feel a little stoic a little wooden at times because there is no body language, always keeping his very straight posture. But I have no doubt he will get his academy award some day. Brie Larson I don't know what went wrong here. She is given nothing. She doesn't really get a character and is basically just there to give files to Michael B. Jordan and give a quick pep talk. Jamie Foxx is really good in his role but neither him nor Jordan are the standouts here. Rob Morgan and Tim Blake Nelson deliver exceptional performances . There parts are small but they make the most of it. So if you want so see something that has worked before go see a pretty solid movie. If you are looking for something new, something innovative this is not the movie for you.",Just Mercy

106,jmvscotland,THIS IS WHY CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS ALWAYS WRONG,8,11 August 2020,"This really is a great movie and one that I will be happy to watch again and again. Well written, wonderfully acted and cleverly directed.It's compelling in every way possible. You only need to know that there is one excellent reason why there are very few countries left in the modern world that still have Capital Punishment in their statutes. The fact is that the legal system is not infallible even in the USA where evidence is sometimes selectively used and sometimes buried in order for the cops and the prosecutors to get a conviction. Mistakes are made and innocent people are convicted of crimes they had no part in, as here.No truly civilized society can support Capital Punishment and therefore it follows that those countries that do are simply not truly civilized. People who are innocent are sometimes convicted for crimes they didn't commit and end up at the hands of those who would put them to death and be happy to do so. This great movie shows that the legal system sometimes gets it wrong and that should really be enough to see an end to Capital Punishment in the USA and everywhere else.It is said that no candidate for high office in the USA is electable if he or she does not support Capital Punishment. I would argue that that needs to change and that candidates just need to stand up for what is right.It is NEVER right or proper for the State to murder an individual, no matter how heinous the crime that he or she is accused of committing. The convicted person might just be innocent.If people enjoyed this movie, there is at the moment (August 2020) an excellent documentary series on Netflix called ""The Innocence Files"" which also deals with wrongful convictions and their dreadful consequences.JMV",Just Mercy

Already being aware of the bias and attitudes of that period in that situation, meant that it didn't present anything new for me. So I wasn't overwhelmed by what I can imagine would be a revelation for others. From the point of a movie and its production values and ideals, something inside me intuitively tells me that something is missing. I can't quite put my finger on it ... I just feel it's been packaged, softened and wound down a bit, so as to avoid aggravating others and opening old wounds. There's nothing wrong with doing this, as it's probably done through respect for the sensitivity of the source material. However, just from my point of view, it would have been more moving if there were more powerful sequences, designed to shock me out of complacency, that I either don't have or don't know exists inside of me. Having stated that, I realize it's not incumbent on the film makers, to try to be mind readers and satisfy everyone who sees it ... but if you appreciate what I am eluding towards, some movies are stunners that magically engage everyone. This one is missing that. At the end of the day, I know I have seen a movie, rather than an important story that needed to be shared and told.",Just Mercy

I have no idea why you all protect your right to bear arms and yet the right to live is just thrown down the toilet.

115,Benslie,An important movie with an amazing message,10,11 January 2020,"Right off the bat, I need to talk about the message in this movie and how incredible it is. Just because I can I'm going to use what Lady Gaga said during the press tour for, ""A Star is Born"" and that's, ""There can be 99 people in the room who don't believe in you and you just need one to believe in you"" or from another movie, ""A true selfless act always sparks another"" and those pretty much sums up the message in this movie that you just need one person to believe in something to start change. One thing I wish is that this movie got more recognition because this movie has so much heart in it and it deserves to be known. One thing is that Jaime Foxx, who plays Walter McMillian, deserves at least an award nomination for best-supporting actor because he acted the shirt out of this role. He went through so many emotions in this movie and brought such an honest portrayal of somebody in his place and how they would act. Michael B. Jordon was also amazing in this movie brings all of the hope into this movie and he makes you route from beginning to end for this character to win the case. Speaking of emotion in this movie it is like a roller-coaster for the audience. There were so many times where I wanted to cry because you feel invested in this movie and grow to care for these people. In the end, Just Mercy is an incredible story with a powerful social commentary and message altogether. I know this movie isn't high on people's radars but please find the time to give this movie a watch because trust me it's worth it.",Just Mercy

117,christophershobris,No Mercy Needed,8,18 January 2020,"Luckily I didn't need mercy for this film, it's not bad, it's a great film! A film involving African Americans being wrongfully treated by officers and lawyers as they are accused of crimes they did not commit; while showing the many flaws in the criminal justice system. Destin Daniel Cretton does a great job of not being one sided, but accurate as to what actually happened. ""Just Mercy"" feels like a combination of ""The Green Mile"" and ""A Few Good Men"" in my opinion. I admittedly teared up a few times while watching this either from heartbreak, or eventual triumph to defeat the beast; that is the flaws within the criminal justice system. As far as the performances go, the best has to go to Jamie Foxx. Foxx delivers his best work since ""Ray"" (his Oscar winning film, where he won the Oscar for Best Actor) and it is gratifying. Michael B. Jordan is great as always. He gave a performance of subtlety, and hit all the marks for this kind of role, proving to me that he can play any role and do it well. While his other performances are outstanding especially in ""Fruitvale Station"" (which is still my favorite) his amount of subtlety won me over here. Rob Morgan gives a spectacularly strong and powerful performance that left me in tears as I said before. So good I thought it was Don Cheadle 😂. But now I know it was Rob Morgan and he deserves all of the credit. The story is powerful, meaningful and taught me a very important lesson; that anyone of any race can be guilty of a crime and vice versa. We all have the right to fight for our freedom and integrity, and stand up for those people who are wrongfully accused just because they have different color skin. This type of treatment needs to stop and this film shows us why and how we can achieve just that. Do you want to see an inspirational movie? Go see this one! Hopefully you will enjoy it as much as I did.",Just Mercy

120,TheCasualReviewer,Jamie Foxx ACTUALLY killed it in this... MBJ too,8,15 January 2020,"SYNOPSIS:
Bryan Stevenson (Michael B. Jordan) is a Harvard-graduated Lawyer who takes it upon himself to start a non-profit organization called the Equal Justice Initiative to help set Walter McMillian (Jamie Foxx) and other falsely accused prisoners free from Death Row.REVIEW SYNOPSIS:
I'm sorry, but why is this film being overlooked as much as it is? I'm so happy I was unable to record my Top 10 of 2019 in time, because this film officially made my list. I got emotional 3 separate times in this film. There have been many films that touch base on similar issues, but this film was so good at making me feel emotionally connected to Walter/Johnny D and his family. Michael B. Jordan's (aka the greatest looking man alive) performance was so damn good and because of how powerful his performance was, he really carried my heart along with his through this film. The direction and the writing were superb. I was so shocked with this movie. The trailers really didn't do much for me. I always thought the subject matter was interesting, but other than that it didn't appeal to me and I'm so glad I saw this movie regardless. Films like this and ""Green Book"" and ""Blindspotting"" are the exact reasons why I love to go to the movies and see whatever I can, because I find gems like these that I otherwise never would've seen. A definite recommendation from me. 8.4/10.----------------------------------------BREAKDOWN---------------------------------------DIRECTION:
Destin Daniel Cretton did such a wonderful job with this film. Every shot was so powerful, especially the court scenes. He captured emotion so well, knowing when to close up and with the back and forth with dialogue. He gave real life to this film and took you along in the journey to changing the course of many lives.WRITING:
Very strong dialogue here. I wasn't bored at any point in this film and I really felt that everything in the script moved the story forward or gave you information on the subject that really mattered. Nothing shoe-horned in just to fill in time. This film was already 2 hours and 17 minutes long and to be honest, I almost wish it went on a bit longer. I wouldn't have minded at all to see a montage of others that he's helped or even if they showed how he was able to get funding for this project in the first place.ACTING:
The cast as a whole did a spectacular job. Rob Morgan, Tim Blake Nelson and Rafe Spall all had tremendous performances that solitified the importance of their characters. Rob Morgan had one of the sequences that damn near became the first time I ever cried in a movie (I swear I have a heart). It was a gut-wrenching watch. Then Tim Blake Nelson playing a character trying to fight his true feelings for what he did. That being said, Jamie Foxx was incredible in this film and you really felt for him and his family. What caused this emotional connection even more-so than Foxx was Michael B. Jordan. This was definitely his best performance and that's including his performance in ""Fruitvale Station."" He had a very heavy performance and really had me rooting for him the entire way. I was with him at every high and all of the lows. I truly empathized with Bryan, because of this and that is all you can ask from an actor.",Just Mercy

Really, really wow heartless people to think about that doesn't really matter. This is a great film, telling a true story of one of the darkest truths about our justice system ruled by bigotry. Well, I think this movie is really good and the performances of Jamie Fox and Michael B. Jordan are fantastic. So sad that the Oscars this year are ruled by the same type...of justice. Hmmm. They really overlook these performances and this is truly sad. No nominations for this movie at all. Shame! I really enjoyed this film, give it a try. You won't be disappointed.",Just Mercy
123,helenbassett,Just Mercy Film Review - Destin Daniel Cretton Directs Michael B Jordan & Jamie Foxx Walking Closer To God On Alabama's Green Mile,10,1 February 2020,"Destin Daniel Cretton directs a true story you couldn't make up, and in the process makes a mockery of the civil rights that the town, where Harper Lee wrote To Kill A Mocking Bird, are so proud of. In Monroeville, Alabama when a white woman is murdered in the late 80s, the police are looking for a quick result and Walter McMillian is ideal. Of course Walter was at a party miles away when the event took place, but the testimonies of the black party goers don't count, because he fits the profile; he's black and once had a relationship with a white woman. Found guilty and now on Death Row, 'Johnny D' expects his only way out is via the Green Mile.Meanwhile after graduating from Harvard, Michael B. Jordan's Bryan Stevenson wants to represent those at the bottom, and you cannot get any further down than Death Row. Bryan is also black, and in an unshowy role, Brie Larson's Eva Ansley cannot even find anyone to rent them office space, so the newly created Equal Justice Initiative, works out of Eva's home. There are threats from the locals, but Eva accepts the challenges to her family, standing up for the truth. And there is plenty of work, with the Death Row inmates describing their cases to Bryan, but Johnny D's is fascinating.To even get into the prison Bryan is treated disgracefully by a warder, played by Hayes Mercure. And when Bryan finally meets Jamie Foxx's Johnny D, he is unsurprisingly resigned to his future and has heard it all before. Plus his family have already spent all of their money on previous legal help. But Bryan goes to visit them anyway. His legal counsel will not cost anything, and they still have hope that Johnny may be released one day. Even if he himself is just waiting for his execution date.The testimony that the court relied on in Johnny's case was by a known felon Ralph Myers, who (under duress himself), plea bargained to reduce his sentence. Tim Blake Nelson as Ralph, Michael and Jamie were all sensational.Bryan also works on the case of Herbert Richardson. Rob Morgan, again award nomination worthy, compelling as the traumatised veteran who did commit the crime and feels he deserves his punishment, but has genuine mitigating PTSD circumstances that haven't been fully exploited. Johnny D's is the middle cell between Herbert and O'Shea Jackson Jr.'s, Anthony Ray Hinton, another miscarriage of justice, and there is so much camaraderie between the quietly desperate men. As the scent of burning flesh wafts over them when another inmate is brought closer to God. The electric chair scene was brutal, and I wasn't the only one who felt discomfort. You could see it among some of the warders faces, and how it subsequently affects them.But white Alabama isn't subtle, and the institutionally Public Prosecutor played by Rafe Spall is no ally to Bryan. Even when he knows the new evidence casts doubt on Johnny D's case. But have a look at the Mocking Bird museum on your way out! With Michael Harding as the local Sheriff, they are nothing if not loyal to each other. But not sympathetic characters. And truth appeared not to matter, as long as a conviction was secured, and the good people of the town feel safer that someone is in jail. It doesn't matter if it's the wrong person. Often poor, but not exclusively, the film based on Bryan Stevenson's book, A Story of Justice and Redemption, shows us. And the same good people who then went along and re-elected the Sheriff, several times, so obviously didn't care about the important miscarriage of justice that stemmed from the blatant racism so shockingly displayed in this small town.It would be lovely to say that this was the start of change, but while crimes do demand punishment, 30 years on Bryan Stevenson would say there is still far to go for both African and poor white American justice. A sobering film.",Just Mercy
124,Mike_O_Dwyer,No Justice,7,22 January 2020,"I'm not sure you can call it justice or mercy when innocent people are exonerated after spending most of their adult life in prison, on death row. Nothing they've lost can ever be replaced, the lives they might have had washed away by racism, corruption, hopelessness.This isn't the first film to tackle the story of innocent black men incarcerated, or brutalised, or murdered. I doubt it will be the last. I've been watching films like this since the 1960s and nothing has changed, except maybe these days technology allows me to see recordings of unarmed black men being gunned down by police. In many ways things seem to have got worse.The film's biggest flaw is that it is all too common a story. How much of a reflection is it on a society that it comes as no shock that racism and social injustice is rife? This is a story that needs to be told again and again and again and again until they run out of these stories to tell.As always, Jordan fills the screen with an easy charisma and a natural sense of integrity that's rare. Foxx shines quietly in one of his more restrained performances, and Larson does what she can with a peripheral role that feels it should have more weight.From beginning to end it's a straight-forward procedural, the dedicated lawyer fighting the good fight against the odds. Bring your kids to see it.",Just Mercy
125,PerryAtTheMovies,"A must-see, gripping true story...",10,28 December 2020,"Initial Thoughts:
My only regret to watching this movie is that I didn't watch it sooner. This is one of the most emotionally driven movies I have watched in recent memory, and although predictable at times, still drives home the injustices experienced in our world even today.Both Michael B. Jordan and Jamie Foxx acted powerfully throughout and brought this true story to light. I did find at times that things go emotionally stale, but the message is still delivered on point. Some say the story isn't as dark in the movie as in the book, but I still felt that the intent and truth of what happened was depicted. Two hours may be daunting, but the movie flowed so perfectly, that it was over before I knew it. Lastly, the key impact I took from the film, and something that I already believed in before the film, is that everyone, regardless of skin colour, deserves a fair trial.Overall:
This is a must-see. I regret waiting so long to watch it, and it's even better than I would've imagined it. The story, the acting, and the fight for justice are on full display in this two hour drama and is worthy of a 10/10 and your eyes to watch it.Enjoy the show!",Just Mercy
126,warthogjump,Solid film,9,25 January 2020,"A well directed film with Michael B Jordan and Jamie Foxx doing what is necessary for their respective roles. The film is very emotional and true to the heart, despite the message this films delivers unfortunately discrimination against minorities and poor still exist today. However, whereas the acting and direction is good enough, Tim Blake Nelson really steals the show. His acting is absolutely extraordinary!! Discrimination today is not simply colour or race based, it is based against minorities and poor whoever those classes of people may be. Although this film sheds significant light on the issue, it is disappointing to know that in reality the poor and minorities will always find the legal system more challenging and discriminatory.",Just Mercy

Sadly this could have been the case for a movie (& sure it is) whether you're in the rural south or northern metro cities, sigh...Great story showing tenacity and strength of Americans when the facts are forced in front of us.

The legal system is messed up and the we are are racist . This is true . This movie tackles privilege, poverty, culture , prejudice and selfishness . Every one of these themes forces you to think and evaluate yourself , our society and out legal system .I loved the many reminders about "" To Kill a Mockingbird "" and how this was written in the same county . SO powerful ! This is something Americans are proud of , the south is proud of , but every single message in that book . We as a people , as a society are repeating history over and over and over . This movie wasn't afraid to point that out .The storyline surrounding the prison guard Was well done and subtle . I also loved how every single person in this movie was sacrificing to do what was right , it didn't always work out , it was not magic , but they had dignity and principles .I would recommend this to everyone , you will be into the plot , think more deeply and leave wanting to do more for the world around you.",Just Mercy

145,michaeldoud,First Hit: A compelling and moving story about overturning injustice.,10,12 January 2020,"First Hit: A compelling and moving story about overturning injustice.This movie is based on the true-life story of Bryan Stevenson (Michael B. Jordan), who, after finishing law school at Harvard, moved to the deep south to help death-row prisoners in Alabama.Although he was offered prestigious positions in other law firms, his mind was made up while during an internship, he interviewed death-row prisoners. He was deeply touched by these prisoner's stories and, after reviewing their files, that many of these men were unjustly accused and incarcerated.Upon graduating from Harvard and passing the Alabama Bar, he moved to and opened a federally funded group to represent prisoners on death row. Arriving at their new offices, he was informed that he and his office manager Eva Ansley (Brie Larson), wouldn't be able to rent the offices because of the type of work they were doing. Holing up in Eva and her husband's home, they begin their quest to represent wrongfully convicted death-row inmates. The three touched upon in this film were different types of cases.One of the stories is about Herbert Richardson (Rob Morgan), who was convicted of killing someone by a bomb he planted on the front porch of a house. Yes, he made the bomb, but what wasn't taken into consideration was that Richardson had PTSD from his time in Vietnam and had struggled by being in and out of mental health facilities for over 30 years. His story is wonderfully mixed into the overall film by following his appeal process and subsequent death by electrocution. The latter being such a powerful scene, it had our entire Saturday afternoon audience audibly crying.The main story is about Walter McMillian (Jamie Foxx) a man convicted of killing a young 18-year-old girl. The fact was that at the time of the woman's death, he was surrounded by his entire family preparing food for a local fish fry. The testimony that got him incarcerated was given by Ralph Myers (Tim Blake Nelson), who was a convicted felon that made up the story to get off of death row. In other words, he made a deal to lie for the local police and DA so that he would have a more comfortable life in prison.The storyline follows how Stevenson and Ansley, jump through enormous hoops put forth by the Alabama criminal justice system, to let the truth be known. The resistance was put there to keep the criminal justice system from having to say they were criminally wrong and did not hand out justice to everyone equal under the law.The film does a great job of mining the stories of the key players and how they ended up where they are. It also points out the discriminatory nature of many people and areas that still exist in the South.This is a moving film, and I know that anyone seeing it will be impacted by the excellent acting and story behind the characters. The scene where Richarson is put to death is so powerfully well done even though you never see the actual execution. You'd be hard-pressed to not be affected by this scene.Jordan was terrific as Stevenson. He plays this character with kindness and driven compassion which is outwardly kept under wraps. Larson is lovely as a mother and woman who is driven to do the right thing regardless of the impact on her family. Foxx was sublime. I loved the way he slowly let his guard down with Stevenson as time passed. It's a powerful performance. Nelson, as Myers was terrific. His critical role in the story was only outshone by his ability to draw the audience into his persona and how he got to be the person he was. You cannot take your eyes off him when he's on the screen. Morgan was phenomenal. I loved his character and maybe because I am also a Vietnam Veteran. I've met numerous street people who are vets that got lost along the way. His story touched me deeply. Destin Daniel Cretton and Andrew Lanham wrote an outstanding script and dug in where it needed to. Cretton got incredible performances from the entire cast and needs to be commended for bringing this subject to film.Overall: A film worth seeing as the story it tells helps us learn who we are and what we need to change.",Just Mercy

But with a town run full of racism and white authority, evidence doesn't full into Bryan's hands easy and the case becomes harder over a long period of time.This was an amazing film.

For example, people are not free to give their lives, whether the law has the right to take a person's life; For example, whether the deterrent effect of the current life imprisonment + the uncommutable sentencing on criminal ACTS has been able to replace the death penalty; For example, the purpose of punishment is no longer simple justice in the concept of tit-for-tat, killing for life, more should be guided, to education, to analyze the criminal psychology to prevent more crimes... (there are plenty of objections, too.)
But in so many angles, what I never expected is that at the end of the movie, it says that in the United States, the criminals who are executed are proved to be guilty of one out of nine wrongful convictions, so that their lives are taken from them.
Perhaps the law after all has its place which cannot do, but at least one of the meaning that the law procedure justice exists also is in safeguard the rights and interests of the criminal, to the judicial organ power forms the check and balance, also is a kind of would rather let go, can't kill arbitrarily... alas",Just Mercy

161,clarkishome,😎 A hard sell movie that makes you feel like you're there 👍,9,16 January 2020,"This movie is based on a true life scenario that brings light to the injustice of our criminal system in the dirty south. Michael Jordan brought compassion and zeal to his role and it's a shame that it was not released in 2019. For if it was, I would place it in the best picture category in the Oscars. Jamie Foxx, as usual, does an outstanding job in his role as a condemned inmate on death row. Overall, this is a movie that I think all adults should see because it is thoroughly enjoyable and sheds some light on our history. It is definitely worth the money for a ticket so go see it and make your own mind up.",Just Mercy
162,jaredkjacoby,A Powerful Biopic about a Wrongfully Convicted Man,9,26 January 2020,"Just Mercy takes place in Alabama and it is based on the true story of Walter ""Johnny D."" McMillian. He was convicted on a white criminal's testimony put on death row before he even had his trial. Bryan Stevenson, a lawyer from Harvard University, comes to help prove that McMillian is completely innocent and that he deserves to be a free man. He also takes the time to help the other men that are on death row who also had faulty cases and unfair verdicts.Just Mercy was a film that I didn't really hear a lot about until recently. I didn't even see any previews on TV or in theaters, so it kind of fell under the radar until recently. However, I got the urge to see it after I heard about it from my classmates. I made an extra effort to see this film because last week, I came to the theater and I mixed up the showtime, so I ended up not seeing it that day. However, I came back because I really felt the desire to see the film at this point and frankly, I'm glad I saw it now.Just Mercy is an outstanding film. It does so much with it's story and themes. It has important messages about racism in how the justice system treats poor black prisoners. A lot of these men got very sketchy trials and got convicted without enough evidence and/or they would get sentenced to death without considering their mental health. It can open up your eyes to how bias the justice system is for those who don't know a lot about law. Speaking of law, this movie also taught me a lot about how appeals and hearings in court work. Before seeing this, I really did not understand how difficult it was to get the court to even listen to your appeal despite strong evidence that supports your case. I didn't really understand the process at all of how a wrongfully convicted person fights for their freedom. It also explores the relationship between lawyers and inmates. It really changed my view about justice in a way because I used to just think it was black or white as far as innocence or guilt goes. However, now I am starting to think about other factors and whether they should put them into consideration when sentencing someone. Aside from the themes, the movie is fantastic.The story of Johnny D. is so fascinating and as someone who knew nothing about his story, I was really scared about what would happen. The script takes the story and pushes it to the limit with not just important messages, but with a well-executed plot that makes the topic interesting. It starts off a little slow, but by the second act, I was sucked into this movie and I couldn't stop paying attention to what would happen next. Michael B. Jordan and Jamie Foxx deliver terrific performances as Bryan Stevenson and Walter McMillian respectively. I honestly didn't even recognize Jamie Foxx. I just saw Walter McMillian. They help bring out the raw emotion that this film brings. The other performances from Brie Larson, Tim Blake Nelson, Rob Morgan, Rafe Spall and O'Shea Jackson Jr. are all also terrific in this film. Speaking of emotion, MY GOD! I actually teared up in a couple scenes in this film, and that does not happen often. It is an extremely powerful movie and at times, a little hard to watch. I really wasn't as ready for this film as much as I thought I was. Another really good thing about this movie is how beautifully shot and edited it was. It was just a very well-made movie. There were certain shots and transitions that I really liked. There was one scene with Johnny D and Herbert in particular that I really loved. It's nice touches like these that can truly make a movie like this stand out.Just Mercy is just terrific. I am glad it is getting more praise now that more people know about it. I will warn you that it is not for the faint at heart and if you do not want to see a movie with a lot of trauma, this might not be for you. However, I definitely think it is worth watching at some point, particularly in the theater. I am just glad I got experience it because it was so much better than I ever expected it to be.",Just Mercy

Whether you followed the real life story back in the late 80's and early 90's or just learned of it through this movie, try to ignore any transgressions you had or have for a minute. The reason I ask you to do this is very simple. Because any harbored feelings you may have will cloud what I'm asking you to do and that's appreciate the production of the film.What I mean is: Take time to appreciate the supurb acting and writing that went into it. I was astounded by the performances of Jaimie Fox, Micheal B. Jordan, Rafe Spall, Micheal Hardy, Brie Larson and Bob Morgan. But I was completely impressed by two guys I'd really never heard of before and the magnificent acting jobs they did. I'm talking about Tim Blake Nelson and Darrell Britt-Gibson, who played Ralph Meyers and Darnell respectively. I mean not anybody can humble themselves up enough to play a couple of World class LOSERS like these two gentlemen...

Temporary gains brought cheers on those bad people's face and always they forget that their bad deeds and bad intention can bring a disaster to destroy them. Everyone will get the results for their deeds. No one can escape. No one can STOP what God wants. God's judgement is very sharp.

173,Lomax343,Terrfic film - but with something missing,7,25 February 2020,"The acting and direction of this film are first class, and the story it tells is moving and powerful - so it was a surprise to me that I left the cinema thinking it was flawed.It was a while before I could quite put my finger on what the problem was. It wasn't the fact that several of the characters were less than rounded (Bryan Stevenson is portrayed as without flaws, Sherriff Tate is a one-dimensional bigot) - no, it was the fact that only half the story is told.If an innocent man is convicted of a crime he didn't commit, this is a miscarriage of justice. But if a guilty man escapes conviction, this is *also* a miscarriage of justice - and this is something the film doesn't even touch on. Ronda Morrison was murdered, but in this film she is reduced to a mere plot device. No mention is made of her family, who must have *believed* that they'd achieved some sort of closure - only to have their world turned upside down again. This is a theme that ought to have been explored, but wasn't. Even a post-credits line like ""The murder of Ronda Morrison is still officially unsolved"" would've been something.So: a great film as far as it goes, but it doesn't go far enough.",Just Mercy

But the central message about the injustices in our justice system has to be recognized, reviewed and re-evaluated.

184,mvpdom,Justice!!!!!!!,8,9 June 2020,"""Johnny D."" was wrongly accused of murder, and sentence to death until Micheal B. Jordan's character came to fight for justice for people on death row.
Johnny D. was an easy target to draw from the pool of people from the poor black community, and use to give the allusion of justice and doing the right thing by the people in power to the people of the community. There was clearly racist intention among the powerful, (shows how many people still stand for injustice today and we should not turn a blind eye when we see it).
Bryan Stevenson is a good man and his actions should inspire many others to follow in his footsteps and simple help people especially where it is most needed.
The movie holds a clear emphasizes on the injustices, but it does not ignore the people who did the right thing in the story. It shows all the people who come forward with the truth and even the main evidence in the case of him being guilty (Which is clearly falsified to anyone who read it).
The acting in this movie is amazing mainly Jamie Foxx and Michael B. Jordan.
Overall it is really inspiring and made me think about where I want to be a help to society when I choose a career path.

How the system works against a particular community and tortures & forces them to a life of trauma and injustice, how a young man tries everything he can to overturn such injustice and in the end succeeds against all odds - that's the perfect recipe for an amazingly beautiful movie.

190,almiraomerovic,Book is way better,3,5 April 2020,"I felt like I was in a constant state of shock while reading the never-ending examples of case law describing people being mistreated and wrongly convicted due to racism and/or to appease law enforcement personnel and goals. I felt sickened reading about the abuse that happens to men, women and children within the prison system. The prison personnel sometimes doing things considered way worse (in my opinion) to these prisoners than what the prisoners were actually incarcerated for. I had a hard time accepting the statistics of how many children under the age of 18 get life sentences without parole for non-homicide crimes and end up being abused in adult prisons (some children only 13 or 14 years old). Add onto this, the overwhelmingly high percentage of prisoners who are mentally ill without a chance of getting the proper help they need within the prison system. And one of the main themes of the book, proved with endless examples, is the ""criminal justice that continues to treat people better if they are rich and guilty than if they are poor and innocent"". While all of these examples and stories are shocking and upsetting, it was inspiring to learn that Bryan Stevenson was working toward making changes. He ""founded the Equal Justice Initiative, a legal practice dedicated to defending those most desperate and in need: the poor, the wrongly condemned, and women and children trapped in the farthest reaches of our criminal justice system."" Bryan Stevenson's attitude, work ethic and goals were the ""light"" and positivity shining throughout this book. People like him are what make this world a better place!Movie on the other hand was meh, everything was meh, cheesy, cringy, , predictable, lacking depth of character SNOOZEFEST!

He has shown us time and time that he can create just as good as the great creators. Just Mercy tackled injustice humanizing what our government chooses to normalize. Amazing how many people didn't know that this actually happens. Bryan Stevenson (played by Michael B. Jordan) is a young African American lawyer who is fresh and new and ready to take on cases that matter. He picked death-row inmates who are and claim to be innocent.One particulate case is Walter Mcmillan performed by Jaimie Foxx who was sentenced to death in a 1980 case where he was charged for murdering a young white women in a small town in Alabama. This film depicts another look at just what Black American had to go through, not even 50 years ago. The audience was waiting for not another black oppression movie with dynamic, bravery, justice, and elevation.

And Michael B Jordan is climbing into the same boat. It's not hard to play a respectable, intelligent black man when you are a respectable, intelligent black man. Where's your range? Do you take these roles to further enforce your interests and your motivations? If so, I think we got it by now.They throw modern songs (either rap/hip hop) into the mix between scene transitions which personally pisses me off but at least it's not Pharell Williams every time.It's a story worth telling.

197,gravegauze,Read the book: the movie does not do justice to how deeply awful the true story is.,5,19 January 2020,"I came away disappointed by the film adaptation of Just Mercy. This is probably a given, but the film adaptation is very overly-dramatized, and not completely true to the story. While this is expected, I find it in this case to be in somewhat poor taste considering everything is a portrayal of real-life people and real-life events.Having read the book, you would see that the racism that actually took place was seriously watered down for the film adaptation. The film also touches on things from the book briefly but not enough to give you the entire picture or depth of the situation. For example, the film also briefly follows Herb, who is being executed for murdering a girl. While the film touches on his PTSD and having been a veteran, and ""making a bomb"", the film doesn't explain, like the book did, that it was illegal for the state of Alabama to execute Herb because he had no intention of killing anyone (he made the bomb as part of a convoluted plan to ""rescue"" his old girlfriend and win her back, but instead the bomb killed her young daughter). The state of Alabama executed him anyway after Stevenson's last minute appeal because it was ""too late"".In the movie, Herb also has ""no family"" and gives his flag to Stevenson. In real life, he was surrounded by family, including a new partner who refused to give him up when he had to be taken away to be executed (by the way, his execution in the film is just a simple ""thud"").I also found Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Walter McMillian to be wildly inaccurate. In the movie, he blows up upon first meeting Stevenson, and comes off as someone who is nonchalant about life at Holman Correctional Facility and knows everything about the decorum there. He even refuses Stevenson's services at first. In real life, Walter was traumatized by the conditions at Holman and during his case was desperately seeking Stevenson's attention over that of his fellow inmates.There are several critiques I have for the film, but I don't want to spoil the central story. I strongly recommend you read the book instead, because you will walk away from it with a much more thorough understanding of our criminal justice system and what's really going on in America.",Just Mercy

206,westerfieldreviews,"""The Heart of the Truth""",8,14 January 2020,"Destin Daniel Cretton retells the remarkable true story of how defense attorney Bryan Stevenson worked to appeal an innocent man's case who was wrongfully accused and sentenced to death for a crime he did not commit. Just Mercy may be set between the years of 1988 and 1993, but it still manages to stand as a powerful reflection of the times we live in. The film critiques and puts on full display the many flaws that are deeply rooted within the United States justice system which are still rarely ever being addressed. Just Mercy is a film that will undoubtedly break your heart and lift your spirits all throughout its two hours and sixteen-minute runtime. The entire cast and crew have united together to create a work of art that will certainly make audiences look themselves in the mirror and reflect for years to come.Just Mercy begins by introducing us to Walter McMillian (Jamie Foxx) as he performs his lumber work for his own personal business. The day eventually comes to a close and as he sees himself driving back to his house, he is pulled over and unjustly arrested by a police officer with little to no questions asked and immediately put on death row. The film then transitions over to a young Bryan Stevenson (Michal B. Jordan) and we get to witness his first visit on an internship to go and speak with an inmate on death row. Through this initial exchange, Bryan builds a connection and finds much in common with this inmate; one that most would see on the street and cross to the other side for. It is at this moment, that Bryan discovers what his true passion is. We fast forward a few years and pick up with Bryan who is now moving down to the state of Alabama to begin his work in forming the Equal Justice Initiative (EJI) alongside Eva Ansley (Brie Larson). Some minor conflicts arise during the process causing the pair to begin their work outside of Eva's home. One of the first cases they pick up is none other than Walter McMillian's case. When Bryan enters Holman State Prison, he meets with several death row inmates before taking a seat and having a chat with Walter. Walter maintains his innocence during the entire duration of their meeting prompting Bryan to pick up the case and begin his work. Throughout the entirety of Just Mercy, we follow along with Bryan as he dives deeper into the well of Ronda Morrison's murder uncovering the faulty testimonies, lack of evidence, and racial discrimination that suffocated the whole case; while simultaneously growing to understand Walter's pains and triumphs. Even if the viewer is aware of the outcome in regards to the Walter McMillian case, one can not be prepared for the beautiful story that is put on full display.Without a doubt, one of the strongest qualities Just Mercy possesses is its outstanding cast. Across the board, Micheal B. Jordan, Jamie Foxx, Brie Larson, Karan Kendrick, Rob Morgan, and Tim Blake Nelson along with everyone else, all show up and deliver fantastic performances. Each and every performer brings a presence to the screen pushing their raw emotions forward that will undoubtedly pull you in with every word. It should also be mentioned that not only do the performers pull off stellar work, but the lines of dialogue they speak aloud are also written incredibly well. Destin Daniel Cretton and Andrew Lanham fantastically adapt Bryan Stevenson's novel, Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption in a manner that gives both Jamie Foxx and Michale B. Jordan a shared amount of screentime fully allowing the audience to become captivated with each of their inspiring stories. I now wish to take some time to discuss who I believe delivers one of the most exceptional performances I have seen all year; that being Rob Morgan as Herbert Richardson. Mr. Richardson was a Vietnam War veteran that was honorably discharged in 1966. Upon his return home, he suffered from PTSD and several traumatic injuries that ultimately led him into the care of a nurse at the hospital he was stationed at. Here, Mr. Richardson would build a relationship with this nurse until she decided to leave him for good. Upset as Mr. Richardson was, he wanted to win her heart back so he devised a plan to create a bomb that would injure the woman with the hopes that he could save her, thus reigniting that romantic relationship he had been yearning for. Unfortunately, the plan did not go as intended; instead of the woman picking up the bomb, a young girl by the name of Rena Mae recovered it and instantly died from the blast. After a racially discriminatory trial, Mr. Rciahrdson was swiftly charged with capital murder and sentenced to death. Given the circumstances of the case, you are left with a sinking feeling that the country Mr. Richardson had fought for, had now kicked him to the curb and neglected the deep internal struggles he had never fully coped with; instead of aiding him, they abandoned him. Morgan brings Mr. Richardson's story to life in such a perfect fashion that you will not just see a killer, but instead, a complex and broken man that lost himself long ago. Morgan conveys a harrowing yet marvelous performance that will last with you well after the film's credits roll.No review of Just Mercy would ever be complete without mentioning the real hero behind it all, Bryan Stevenson. Stevenson is a Harvard graduate that began his work with the Southern Center for Human Rights for several years until the United States Congress suspended the funding for death penalty defense. In 1989, Stevenson founded the Equal Justice Initiative (EJI) to fill the void that was left vacant by the U.S. government. He began working closely with death row inmates to review their cases and aid in appealing them if foul play was suspected. As of today, Stevenson and his team have been committed to challenging racial injustices all throughout the United States and have currently helped in reversing or freeing more than 135 wrongfully accused peoples. As his career has pressed forward, he has been acknowledged for his exceptional work by many public figures and organizations, while also traveling around the country leading lectures as a public speaker at universities and other events. With his valiant efforts at the EJI, he stands as a true advocate for the change he wants to see making him a true honorable modern-day figure. Bryan Stevenson delivered a riveting speech at Standford University in 2016 where he discussed the racial inequalities within the criminal justice system of America. During his speech, he broached four key topics that I will use as a final note to you; if you wish to change the injustice happening within America you must be proximate, change the narrative, protect hope, and make yourself and those around you, uncomfortable. A challenge will lead to a change.Just Mercy is an astonishingly important film because, despite the story taking place in the late 80's and early 90's, it feels like a news report we could be hearing today. The film asks audiences to reflect on the racist history of America and realize that slavery did not die in 1865, it merely evolved. Just Mercy will make you upset, laugh, cry, and smile until it's bittersweet ending when you recognize that this kind of tale is a reality for hundreds of people in our country today. But, in the end, the film will leave you with an undeniable sense of hope that if we all come together, a change can come.Final Verdict: B",Just Mercy
207,dal_asher,An Honest Telling of our Broken Justice System,10,29 March 2021,"This is the story of an idealistic young black Harvard graduate who dedicates himself to working with death row inmates beginning with cases in Alabama. Michael B. Jordan's performance is nothing short of outstanding. He plays this role with quiet compassion and empathy. In the beginning scene where he goes to the prison to see his 7 clients, he is stripped searched and you can see the pain clearly on his face knowing he must submit simply because he is black. Jamie Fox's understated performance is exactly the right tone. It would have been easy to show a seething bitterness at the system that put in on death row a year before he was convicted but his resignation to his fate was far more telling. These two performances were both Oscar worthy. This is a story that should be required viewing for all school students. We need civics classes once again in our schools. This is a movie I can highly recommend and as we head into the trial of George Floyd's killer it should be viewed with a Black Lives Matter mind set. All lives matter but in America, as this film depicts, black lives seem to matter less and that is simply wrong. The message of this film cannot be overstated. Bigotry and hatred have no place in the law. Justice for all period.",Just Mercy

Michael B. Jordan keeps getting better as an actor and this was a nice role for him, definitely a change of pace, and he did a great job. I'm not a person who cries much, but tears were flowing during parts of the movie, then the end credits rolled and they were like a punch in the gut. Jim Valvano (""Jimmy V"") said something like ""something should move you every day, you should laugh or cry, every day""- and there are a moments in this movie where you are totally moved to anger, tears, and joy. I've read the reviews and I see some people complaining about the pace and the wardrobe (!! Are you kidding me?)- and one person said there wasn't enough humor in it. Those people are fools. This movie is not a comedy and not an action movie, this isn't a Sly Stallone prison movie, it's a real life story, and an outstanding one, even if it is tough to watch at times. It has been a long time since I've been in a theater where the crowd doesn't move when the credits start rolling, but that's what happened tonight- the whole crowd sat there reading the credits and getting ourselves together. I really liked this movie.",Just Mercy

🏆(strong Oscar potential for best adapted screenplay)Just Mercy (Destin Daniel Cretton) is a touching story with an emotional depth and sense of purpose rare in modern films. It's difficult to tell a story so dedicated to a social issue without it seeming belaboured, but this film pulls it off brilliantly. Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Foxx, and Brie Larson beautifully embody real-life characters in this well crafted film. They truly do the story justice. Bryan Stevenson, whose story the film is based on, was at the TIFF screening and the presence of this real-life hero seemed to impact the audience as much as the film had.

The fact that this is a real life story and all characters are indeed real humans made me sad.Michael B.

I was surprised how much similar, they look like their real life companions who were shown at the end of the film. Kudos to the casting director and director for picking out right people.I believe people should see this film and understand how even after centuries, racism still exists and innocent people are at the end of the sword.

I fear that some viewers may focus on only the primary case study and see it as a racism driven one off case story. In truth, it is one of over 140 recent cases of an innocent person being wrongly convicted and sent to death row. The common thread in all those cases is that the defendant is poor and can't afford a fair trial and defense in our broken criminal justice system. I blame the film's marketing for pitching it as a story about racial injustice in one man's case when really it is an important showcase about an unjust system in many men's cases. This is a ""must see"" film that deserves a broad audience and merits deep discussion.",Just Mercy

229,stephenmatlock,Sometimes a movie is more than a movie,9,19 January 2020,"Sometimes a movie is just a movie. It entertains. It thrills. It chills. It amuses.But sometimes a movie a slice of life so real that you are in the film, right alongside the characters, wondering if your own actions will help ensure the triumph of right over evil--and maybe a little bit scared that you will be the one with the flashlight and the gun and the key and the belt and access to the electrical switch.I found myself in such a place with this movie. Sure, everyone likes to be the hero of their *own"" movie--that's part of being human. But I was wincing and blinking at the sheer terror that is meted out to our brothers and sisters, casually, confidently, with the assurance that such cruelty is the way of the Lord. (The movie subtly weaves the church in with the injustice, noting that the presence of the community of believers is the effectual working out of injustice--it's planned and ordained by the Good Lord Himself. I'm a believer, and a sinner, and I'm daily appalled at the fallenness of my own people. But, that's a discussion for another time--it is not this movie's theme.)I have seen Michael B. Jordan (Bryan Stevenson) in other movies, and have enjoyed his presence. (Who doesn't like him as Killmonger? C'mon.) I just want to say, his acting here is incredible--and perhaps because it is representational. His journey in this movie from holding a strong, confident belief that right will prevail through the middle where his confidence is broken to the end where he is wiser, grateful, but much more knowledgeable about how things ""really work"" is a sobering delight to watch. This is *acting*.Jamie Foxx (Walter McMillan) is caged despair and rage and nearly erased hope. There is only a metal screen left in his world as the view to the rest of society, a society that saw him as guilty of capital crime a year before he was convicted. Any Black man can be picked up and criminalized because every Black man is guilty. That's the appalling truth at the end, spoken aloud to the audience in the courtroom because often the judge, jury, and audience want to believe that Justice-with-a-capital-J is what drives us. It's not justice, though. It's free-floating anger and fear, and it's revenge against an inchoate enemy. But God is good, y'all, and even though the system is set against the character of Walter--a touch of spring appears after a 500-year-long winter: Walter is finally seen.The other characters are all fine, and I note with pleasure that this is a Black story centering Black characters with Black redeemers. This is not a white savior movie. (And thank God for that. Enough with movies like Green Book.) Brie Larson's Eva is an assistant who pops in when needed, and Tim Blake Nelson's Ralph is the pivotal villain who is manipulable in his fears by the system determine to find a Black man--any Black man--guilty. He's finally led to tell the truth. He is not the hero for doing so, but merely no longer impeding justice in his fears.There is an awful secret in America about existing as Black, a secret that is discoverable if we have the slightest curiosity, and this movie does not demand that we see it. It does, however, provide an opportunity in the privacy of a darkened theater to consider whether we are going to seek our own ways, or if we will seek just mercy. And then, maybe, we'll decide to move.Nine/Ten stars for a bit of over-the-top music and montages. They are wonderful to experience, satisfying conclusions of our own hopes at redemption, but I think in comparison to the rest of the movie they take us out the moment. It's not bad to do so, because it does ground us in our own reality. It is a slight fault in the craft of the movie-as-a-movie. Otherwise, the movie is just outstandingly created, shot by shot, in a way that leaves you breathless at the creativity and strength of the production team. Costumes are invisibly accurate to the times, and sets and lights are wonderfully done--it is difficult to light Black skin appropriately, but the combination of skillful lighting and filming keeps the actors from disappearing into shadow.",Just Mercy

Brian Stephenson was a hero and their should be a holiday named for him.Great film and great acting. Yes, the book recounted much more violent acts. We don't need to see the electric chair scenes or lynchings to have compassion and demand justice. It's a good story and movies are meant to view perspectives other than our own. This film does that.",Just Mercy
232,ewanfortune,Very Moving,10,21 January 2020,"Just Mercy is a powerful movie about the injustices and racism present in the justice system in America. It's anti-hate and against the death sentence and these messages are wrapped up in an inspiring and very moving story. Michael B. Jordan is excellent as Bryan Stevenson, a black lawyer that has graduated from Harvard. His goal is to provide legal assistance to people on death row that can't afford it. In doing so, he comes across Walter 'Johnny D' McMillian, who is played equally as brilliant by Jamie Foxx, and is accused of murder. Walter is very clearly innocent with no hard evidence against him yet the all-white jury has decided he'll be executed anyway.Despite numerous setbacks, Stevenson continues to work on this case which should be cut and dry. However, the Sherriff in this town in Alabama is all too happy to frame a black man and the DA and Judges don't seem too bothered about finding out the truth either. Over the course of the film, there are many moments that make you reflect on how evil certain people are, thinking people are inferior to them because of the colour of their skin. It invokes anger and frustration and you are firmly behind Stevenson and McMillian. The supporting cast is very strong too with the likes of Brie Larson, Rob Morgan and Tim Blake Nelson.It's a movie that is unfortunately all too real and will continue to be for some time. We need people like Bryan Stevenson to fight back and people to watch movies like this and learn from them.",Just Mercy

He was able to step into the shoes of the lawyer in such a genuine way.Since the movie is based on a true story, the realization of all of this being real hangs over your head while watching the film.

241,diazaraceli,A modern day Greek tragedy accompanied by a really bad soundtrack!,7,1 February 2020,"Just Mercy is reminiscent of a Greek tragedy in the fact that most of the culminating drama occurs off screen and is later narrated by the lawyer Bryan Stevenson (portrayed by Michal B. Jordan) via jail house interviews, phone conversations, cassette tape recordings, or court documents. For courtroom drama aficionados this is right up their ally! But, for the modern day ""viral video sensation"" generation that expects instant gratification in 30 seconds or less, this not going to cut it! It has way too much mumble-jumble for the average person to understand. Legal terms that are not a part of the layman's lexicon.SPOILER ALERT: The average movie goer does not want hear about the events that transpired, after the fact, they want to see it all happen right in front of their very eyes! They want to see Walter ""Johnny D"" McMillian (portrayed by Jamie Foxx) at the church barbecue, (It was actually a church fish fry, but they changed it to a bbq in the movie.) while the beautiful, blonde teenager is being brutally murdered at the dry cleaners! They want to see him have a salacious love affair with a white woman.. (*He had an affair with an older, white married woman and not the teenager that was murdered.) This thrill-seeking audience does not want to hear about Sheriff Tom Tate's unconventional tactics, they want to see him in action! They want to see it all! They want to experience all the ""titillating details"" first hand.Also, Walter ""Johnny D"" McMillian served 6 years on death row! That is a long, long time! Yet, except for a few fuzzy, out-of-focus pictures, the audience does not see his babies at the time of his arrest. By the time, he was released, they were practically grown. It would have been more compelling to see them portrayed as children.Finally, with all the beautiful music out there, this movie needs a new sound track! Music is powerful! The soundtrack to a movie is critical to it's success. It can literally make or break a movie! I would have rated the movie a 10, if they had just had a better soundtrack.Kudos to the movie makers for using real 60 minutes footage. The news reporter, Ed Bradley is an American icon, but he started out as a humble public school teacher. One of the last interviews of Ed Bradley that I saw was of him dancing with Sir Mick Jagger at the Jazz Parade in New Orleans. I'm too emotional! This movie made me cry, but for all the wrong reasons!FUNNY ANECDOTE: My boyfriend kept asking me questions during the movie. Until one guy turned around and told us to stop talking. Later on, in the parking lot, I was wiping down the frost off my windshield, when I spotted the man who shushed me getting into his truck. So, I started proclaiming in a very loud voice, ""If they tell you to sit down, STAND UP! If they tell you to be quiet, SPEAK UP!"" The guy started shaking his head laughing and gave me the thumbs up!",Just Mercy

I really hate that! Why can t the story be truthful to the facts! It would still be a powerful story because it was factual. The movie as made is false in many ways which i will refrain from detailing except for one point which is the current prosecutor immediately recognized the injustice and did not pursue a retrial. a very interesting story of a true case with false dialogue and inaccuracies. this is what Hollywood does too often.

245,tthirdbro,No character development at all,3,23 April 2020,"Maybe dipping into who Walter McMillian was as a man, as a father, and as a husband was a risky proposition, considering he wasn't a ""good man"". A cheating husband with 9 children at home .. Maybe its hard to go back into his past and find appealing qualities. Maybe that is why this story lacks character development? I don't know.In any case, it lacks that personal connection with the people involved. Its hard to feel what they feel. It was hard to get a sense of McMillian's pain (which I am sure he felt). ... Then adding a fictitious stories like police in 1990s pulling over the black attorney without cause and putting a gun to his head, but to cause him fear for representing a convicted black man, it takes away from the depth of the real events.Had the movie focused on Bryan Stevenson's tireless fight for justice, and the true facts of the injustices he fought against, it may have worked. ... Sadly, I was left not knowing who Bryan Stevenson was. I was left wondering why he was a man who allowed prison guards to illegally strip search him. Who was that man? The inner person? I think the movie missed the opportunity to reveal the depth of his character ... and others too.",Just Mercy
246,watchitwombat,"Enthralled, Enraged, Heartbroken",6,8 February 2020,"If you don't remember the story of Walter 'Jimmy D' McMillian, steer clear of looking it up before watching Just Mercy.

Jordan has been on my radar as a serious actor ever since Fruitvale Station (let's not talk about the 2 Rocky movies) and his performance inJust Mercy solidifies him as a phenomenally talented actor. Foxx's' portrayal as McMillian is possibly more Oscar worthy than his Ray Charles impression, and Brie Larson positively lights up the screen as Stevenson's real-life Operations Director Eve Ansley. It's lengthy at 2237 minutes, but for me it genuinely didn't drag.The score telegraphs the outcome of a couple of the more dramatic crossroads but all up Just Mercy left me enthralled, enraged, heartbroken, and with a lot to think about.

256,MovieAnalysis,Just Mercy- A Film with Crucial Message,8,6 June 2020,"In 1987, Walter ""Johnny D"" McMillian (Jamie Foxx)gets arrested and sentenced to death for the murder of a young white woman. Somewhere in 1989, Harvard law graduate Bryan Stevenson(Michael B. Jordan) travels to the state of Albama and establishes ""Equal Justice Initiative"" with Eva Ansley (Brie Larson) to help those who seek. There he learns about McMillian's Case and decides to fight and get justice for him.
Director Destin Cretton on-board audience in such a way that it becomes nearly impossible to take yourself out of the storm of emotions. Just Mercy unfolds layer by layer & explores all corners of judicial system and our social surrounding and how it still needs so much improvement. How system can be so prejudice and indifferent for one portion of society? How gates of Justice are closed for them? These questions resounds throughout the film. The film put Stevenson's struggle to portray the challenges and difficulties one has to face when he's fighting with the System. This becomes more problematic when no one wants to see the truth, which is as clear as crystal. Just Mercy isn't something exceptional or extraordinary but it strongly hits the right spots at right time.
Jamie Foxx's expression's speaks for him throughout the movie and are more effective than the dialogues. The authentic performances by supporting cast is one key elements of the film. Rob Morgan as Herbert Richardson and Tim Nelson as Ralph Myers gives a memorable performances. Brie Larson in a little screen time given, leaves impression. She may not be a popular choice for superhero films, but she's a perfect actor to play real life heroes on screen. Michael B. Jordan shines throughout the film and we can expect to see him in such roles again in future.
With a huge cast, Just Mercy faces challenges in character development. Supporting casts are introduced without any background story. Unfortunately Cretton fails to effectively utilize the talent of academy award winner Brie Larson. Also film struggles in providing sufficient screen time to all characters except its protagonists.
Films like this are very much needed, so that we keep on improving ourselves and the society. It becomes more important when the shocking facts are presented to us. It makes us think what we have achieved and what need to be achieved yet. Just Mercy can be the story of one place or a country but there are social problems (which need to eliminated) in every country, just the scenario and people changes.
Overall, Just Mercy is not the film which is driven by strong story line or enjoyable courtroom drama but it relies on the emotional build up which it creates by exposing harsh reality. One don't feel the runtime of 136 min while watching. You get strong performances and the film delivers an important social message. All this makes Just Mercy a film, almost impossible to ignore or miss.",Just Mercy

This story is about two men, one who was wrongfully accused and convicted for a crime he didn't commit and a man who just wants to help people who haven't gotten any.What I think I loved most about this movie is that they didn't over-do anything. The set design, costumes, plot, and all were just about the story. They didn't over-hype any moments or feel that the director/producers were pushing any political agendas. They were just telling a story. Does that story have political ramifications? Yes, you better believe it. But the movie was a story, and a powerful one at that!",Just Mercy
261,shimotorres,"Important, moving, well done",8,26 January 2020,"My 16 year old wanted to see this because they read the book in school (good for the teacher). I expected to be moved and angered by the story, and I was. Michael B. Jordan was great. The way his character talked to people, to get through to their hearts and sense of justice to do the right thing, was so effective. I found myself wondering during the film if the real Bryan Stevenson had that effect on people. And of course, Jamie Foxx was great. But one actor's portrayal really stood out to me, the prison guard Jeremy, played by Hayes Mercure. His was a minor role, but through his eyes and body language, he managed to depict his change of heart and perspective after witnessing his first execution, and learning about the injustices of McMillian's case.McMillian's case illustrates the issues of our ""justice"" system - that it can be too easily manipulated by those in power, those who are supposed to be upholding justice but are instead embedded in and motivated by deep rooted racism. Sheriff Tate finally retired in 2019 after over 30 years of being Monroe County's ""law"" man...who knows what corruption he initiated and supported all those years. All I could think of while watching Tate's manipulative power holds over everyone was - WHO was Tate protecting? Did HE kill Ronda Morrison? Or someone close to him? HE should be investigated...",Just Mercy
262,sureshgrant,Brilliant that this movie exists!,7,25 January 2020,"Having read the book, ""Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption"", I kept reflecting during the movie if a mainstream movie could do justice to how I was so inspired by the book to work towards bringing opportunities and privileges (and justice) to the disenfranchised and vulnerable.
I like the movie, I cried at the process of an execution and the vulnerability of that, and I loved that this movie does expose some social justice content to the mainstream.
The book, however, took me to greater depths and introduced me to the greater philosophy, beliefs and journey of Bryan, and whose simple words 'I am not my worst behaviour', has been a motto for me when I deal with clients. I was also deeply moved by the depth of cases in the book, particularly the impacts of child incarceration. As a follow up, I read Ray Hinton's book (who is one of three prisoner showcased in the movie), 'The Sun does Shine', which brilliantly sheds insights into his nearly thirty years on death row.
I hope the movie inspires the mainstream and future social justice advocates to lend effort or advocate in social justice streams, or to read the book or watch one of the youtube videos on Bryan Stevenson or Ray Hinton.",Just Mercy

268,chrisandmark-44838,Great Story But Not Much Else,6,19 February 2020,"I love a good true story, especially a court room drama based on wrongful convictions but I am starting to realise that these incredible stories are being told in a very routine way when you breakdown movies similar to this such as Hilary Swanks Conviction or Denzel Washingtons the Hurricane and others.Individual wrongly convicted and placed on Death Row and then hot shot lawyer comes along and gets them off in the end but along the way faces the routine setbacks you have seen in all of these types of movies but justice always prevails in the end. Now I'm not saying that these stories don't warrant being told on the big screen and as they should add a trilling car chase or death defying leap of a tall building in to the screenplay but at the heart of it if you have seen one of these movies you have seen them all.However, that could change if a movie of this type offered us something new or gave us portrayals that blew us away with captivating dialogue or if the movie and characters had depth, dimensions and layers but I struggle to raise a argument that Just Mercy offers any of these.Michael B Jordan is fine actor and his heart is in the right place, you cant help but admire his choice of previous projects as well as this one. He has integrity and passion for his craft but that passions fails to come through in his portrayal in this movie, instead we are given a pretty standard lawyer performance that is at times wooden and bland. I wanted to see some conviction in trying to over turn the conviction but Jordan instead walks his way through the movie at a snails pace and fails to get into 2nd gear. His characteristics and body language gave little in the way of depth and conveying of emotions his character was feeling. His dialogue was rolled off the tongue with out any effort to make us believe in what he was saying to us.Jamie Foxx for the most part can do know wrong what Michael lacked in conviction, nuances and body language no matter how subtle yet still captivating Jamie served with truth and skill throughout the movie. Jamie doesn't have to do a whole lot to serve up realness because it just has that something in his eyes. His dialogue comes from a place deep within again its subtle but its just pure acting skill and ability to real make us believe in what he is saying.The story plods along and fails to really over or under achieve at any point in the movie. Theres no real emotional or thrilling moments in the movie probably because its based on a true story and you know what happens at the end but the thrills could have been found else were even in the dialogue between the characters that failed to get above lukewarm.Its a case of I have seen it all before and the shame of it is....I have seen it done better.",Just Mercy

276,Albino_Hyena,Solid performances and a competent screenplay keep you engaged,7,30 December 2019,"If I was to list this film's greatest strength, that would be its ability to pull you into the characters' situation and feel their sense of frustration at the injustice they face. The film opens with one man being aggressively arrested for a crime he didn't commit, then transitions to a young student visiting prison for the first time, where he meets a peer who turns out to be more relatable than expected. From there, the audience sees how these men are driven, what they're fighting for, and how it effects their lives as well as the community around them.Michael B Jordan, as usual, was fantastic. He did a great job portraying this young idealist who, despite being Harvard educated and possessing solid evidence, finds himself unable to make the difference he originally thought he could. Jamie Foxx's performance was also great; he displayed genuine vulnerability and emotion as this embittered, beaten-down (but still somewhat hopeful) man in a cruel world.I had no issues with the technical aspects of this movie; they didn't do anything special nor did they do anything wrong. This being a legal drama, the script might feel a bit predictable to some, and some of the dialog/speeches seemed a bit too grandiose for real life. There are a few scenes, especially the two montages set to music, that felt a bit cliched, but this movie also has two particular sequences (which I won't spoil here) in the second half that are very effective and powerful.Overall, this is a well-made and well-acted movie adapted from a pretty important true story, so I would recommend it to anyone interested in criminal justice or simply anyone who enjoys cinema made with a purpose.
*P.S, don't watch the full trailer; it showed way too much from the third act of the movie. I don't count that against the film itself, as the marketing team is separate from the cast and crew, but I just wanted to warn people.",Just Mercy

2019
Deeply profound and thought provoking, Just Mercy does more than just entertain it makes you question both our government and our society. It does a great job of keeping the audience engaged and entertained while schooling them on race relations and the death penalty. Michael B Jordan and Jamie Fox deliver powerful performances that will make you care about these characters and what they stand for.
Fresh out of Harvard Law School, attorney Bryan Stevenson decides to move to Alabama and fight for justice for people on death row. In the process he meets Walter McMillian, a man convicted of a murder that he swears he did not commit. Stevenson takes on the case and thus starts a lengthy career as a civil rights lawyer.
Based on the true story of Bryan Stevenson, Just Mercy is a powerful movie. Know that you will question your position on both race and the death penalty by the end of the movie. That is the point though. If only 10% of this movie is accurate, it would make a person sick. Even more importantly is the timing of this movie. It fits directly into current events, which actually makes it even more sad since the movie takes place over 25 years ago. This should be required viewing for anyone who dares to oppose the protests of government and police brutality. Please watch this movie.

Acting is good. The runtime felt a tiny bit longer than I would've liked, but nothing disruptive enough to destroy the pacing of the story.With all of that out of the way, I don't understand the reaction this movie has been getting. I think it's perfectly fine if you don't like the acting or consider the story boring or any other factor that might throw you off. It boils down to personal preference and it's absolutely fine to dislike the movie.I had read comments talking about how it caters to the left propaganda but at no point did I see any kind of political ideology being pushed into the fray.If movies that build their story acknowledging racism seem political to you, this movie is not for you.Addressing social issues is not political.

294,extreme_weasel,Mercy makes life better,8,29 January 2020,"The experience of watching this was not so much a 'slow burn' as a persistent earnestness that delivered a victory of the heart, without posturing or pretense. Seeing the statistics, images and footage of real people through the end credits really brought home the power and importance of 'mercy'.The cinematography deserves particular appreciation since it holds the viewer in quite a 'naked' portal into this world. The framing of characters and conversations is direct, without extremes - squared up shots of people with no escape (the prisoners who cannot, the lawyer who will not), with geometric 90 degree aspects in the backgrounds (prison bars, empty bookshelves that progressively fill, window frames, wood trims on walls). Whenever 'the state system' appears in establishing shots, e.g. the courthouse or the prison, the screen is filled to bursting with these imposing, dominating institutions - the Goliath to the protagonist's ""David"". The only deviation from straight framing was in the scenes where the lawyer was reviewing the cases, leafing through files and papers, looking for anything on which he could build a genuine court appeal. The camera was level with the papers on the desk, looking up at him - like it was the piece of evidence he needed, waiting for his discovery. Very subtle, and once again pulling us in without being showy.I didn't think the film affected me so strongly until I tried to describe it to friends the next day. I guess THAT's when the slow burn hit home for me.Overall, the ensemble cast presents believable characters, with relatable degrees of humanity in such extreme circumstances. I was particularly moved by the humble brotherhood of the inmates on death row.For me, the only misstep in writing was the legal assistant. I am confident that the real person is feisty, upbeat and dedicated, but in this portrayal, she is giving the trope touchstones of 'wife' and 'mother' in the first half of the film, though these aspects completely vanish for the second half, making them feel like plot devices to establish her character, rather than belonging to this story. Perhaps there is a deleted scene that would balance this. Or a line of dialogue to justify her availability has become more flexible as she researches/drives/waits at all hours with no hint of family obligations.Otherwise, a quietly powerful experience. I think we could all do with a bit more mercy ...",Just Mercy

Injustice has been running rampant as recent as 1993, and we need to face it. Dont turn a blind eye to this movie's story. It is 99% accurate to what actually happened and it is a painful, but it also a triumph over evil and racism that deserves celebration. The acting was phenomenal and Jamie Foxx brought tears to my eyes multiple times while i watched: he deserves an Oscar for that performance!
Anyway! Go see Just Mercy! It will not disappoint.",Just Mercy

The scene where one of the prisoner is put to death is the most intense scene I have ever watched in any movie and remains engraved in my memory. This is a movie for our times.

325,loeklangeveld-92140,Cretton's injustice to the story,6,25 January 2020,"For a film about justice Destin Daniel Cretton doesn't do it any. From Micheal B. Jordan as Bryan's, who's performance was good but not challenging, perspective Destin uniquely finds a way to almost portray this true story rather emotionless.--------------WARNING SPOILERS!!!!! ---------------------------The main feature this film is lacking is chaos. From the first meating with Jamie Foxx as Walter McMillen, who's performance is adequate, we know where the story is going. Which would be alright if the rest of the film wouldn't be just a straight line getting there.There is little to no distort in the film which makes it all too mediocre. There are times Destin tried by for instance Walter's son emotionally breaking down inside the court room, but outside of that it's all rather too neat. After that trial dismissal I was waiting and hoping for an oscar worthy scene from Jamie Foxx when he came back to his jailcell that night.I was hoping to feel a glimpse of what Walter must have felt so many years ago. A mental breakdown where you have so much anger but nowhere to put it because of powerlessness, which almost makes you think; just kill me already. Instead Destin chose a simpler route which in my opinion doesn't do the story justice.",Just Mercy

Rob Morgan is pitch perfect as Herbert Lee Richardson.
I don't know why O'Shea Jackson Jr put on so much weight but for his small role, he was very good.
Karan Kendrick should get a lot more attention for her performance as Foxx's on-screen wife Minnie McMillian, who is bravely holding everything together as her husband is facing the death penalty. A husband she has her own issue with but who needs her.
It must be amazing to be Bryan Stevenson and see a movie about yourself and not be old as sand.",Just Mercy

His authentic and subtle portrayal of Ralph Meyer was a joy to watch. In every scene he gives us the raw and nuanced performance of a man beaten down since childhood.

365,gary-18724,"Hard hitting, Emotional, Thought Provoking. EXCELLENT",9,27 February 2020,JUST MERCY dramatises a real-life injustice that is ALL TOO COMMON in some states in America. The film is emotionally painful but justice wins in the eventual exoneration of Walter McMillan. But to think he lost six years of his life on death-row for a crime that he did not commit is crazy and scary. Those years can never be restored and nothing can ever make up for it.Sadly the people who were implicit in the fabrication and wrongful conviction of Walter seem to have prospered in the aftermath.For every nine inmates executed on death row in one innocent person has been set free. This is a scary statistic. How many other innocent people have been executed?Alabama currently has 175 inmates on death row. The death penalty is still legal in 30 of the 52 states in the US.America your civil rights record is atrocious and sickening. The banning of the death penalty is long OVERDUE.,Just Mercy

I can honestly say it is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I appreciate how realistic they made the movie and how they truly showcased the struggles the Black community faced during that time through the convictions of innocent men, as well as the struggles and obstacles the lawyer faced while trying to find the truth.

The reality that this is based on a real event AND it didn't happen that long ago aches me to my core.

But it took hold of me and filled me with emotions as I got more and more engrossed in it.
The likeness of the actors chosen compared to the actual true life characters is very well done and the acting superb.
One tip.. if you go to see this at the cinema don't get up from your seat until all the credits are over because the film gives you a full update about each of the key characters and what happened to them.",Just Mercy
379,boydstu,A FILM FOR ALL TO SEE,9,3 January 2020,"There are some films that explore criminal injustices, racism, and white supremacy that feel like they exist for the pleasure of some sick people to see black people be brutalized. This is not one of those films. Michael B Jordan, Brie Larson & Jamie Foxx do an outstanding job of conveying the pain, neglect, and conviction of their perspective roles.Jordan plays the role of a recent Harvard law school grad who has decided to practice law in Alabama.Larson, a white woman, accompanies him in his fight for equality and criminal justice. She plays her role well and does a great job of conveying emotion.Foxx plays the role of a black man who was lied on about killing an 18 year old white woman and was given death row before his trial even began. I personally believe that Foxx was the show stealer because he commanded attention EVERYTIME he was on screen.Just Mercy is tense, emotional from start to finish, and draws you in and doesn't let you go. It is important to note that the rest of the cast definitely bring their ""A"" game and make the story feel even more personal. Just Mercy is everything it set out to be and more.",Just Mercy

I literally research for great movies but I cannot STAND when these so-called ""movie-buffs"" get so critical as to the writing of the script n all this extra bs, and leave a review...like, I swear some ppl literally live for internet hate..So with all that being said.This movie was phenomenal. Acting was great and forget the writing cuz this is based on a true story..1 review said it's going n that's not the case..This movie needed to be exactly what it was..EXCELLENT!!!!! JAMIE FOXX ,MICHAEL B.JORDAN AND BRIE LARSON WERE ALL GREAT. THIS movie will show u how bad yet real things were for minorities in Alabama back then..Def watch this if u havent already..",Just Mercy
384,actuallyme-48722,"Amazing,emotional, and thought provoking!",4,25 January 2020,This movie was one of the best movies that I have seen in a very long time. It is very powerful and sentimental. It keeps you engage the whole time from the beginning to the end.,Just Mercy
385,woftram,Solid film,6,1 February 2020,Good acting but the script was a little weak Protagonasts and Antagonasts were too black and white for such complex issues.,Just Mercy
386,sharathmahadeshwara,movie show's how the society works,10,20 July 2020,"More mature, so true. this movie is just super. you can see how the peoples are exploited, if they are helpless in the antagonist society. though you are right but majority votes you are wrong, where will you go to prove your self? really this movie is a gem.",Just Mercy
387,emilygoode-69620,Very pleasantly surprised!,10,18 March 2020,This movie really touched me. The acting was wonderful too. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. It is a great reminder of just how much so many of us take for granted in this life.,Just Mercy
388,johnballer,Absolutely loved it,9,5 April 2020,"From the second it started, it hooked me. This movie Keeps you engaged every second of the way. A movie that hits you right in the gut. Michael B outdid himself in this one. So did Fox. They both took these roles very serious and poured their whole heart into it. Good writing, good storytelling, amazing performances. This movie is a must watch.",Just Mercy
389,venkatesanprakasam,Truth - Hard to Imagine,9,6 April 2020,"Absolutely awesome movie, if you are an biography person. Hard to Imagine in back old days how a community is treated, suffered, pain they went through and how they choreagraphed all real incidents is hatts of to the movie crew. Really this movie brings your tears when the judge says all charges dismissed. Must watch movie.",Just Mercy
390,duongthanhfr,One of the best films I've ever seen,9,1 May 2020,"I always remember the feeling when I came out of the cinema after watching this film : I had never ever cried that much in the cinema before.""Just Mercy"" is definitely not the movie with the best actors, most impressive scenes, best music, etc. It just did what a movie should do : tell a truly touching and inspiring story. Michel Jordan acts really well, his last lecture in the movie was just breaktaking.Personnally fond of historical and inspiring stories, I hightly recommend this movie",Just Mercy
391,atayoktay,"True story, Worth watching the film",8,16 May 2020,"You can tell where the movie is going from the beginning.
The actors performed so good and the subject is well treated that you stay awake till the end of the movie.",Just Mercy
392,bdemirbuga,Must watch,9,24 May 2020,Perfect. Should watch. Justice one day everybody will need.,Just Mercy
393,annetle,MOVING,10,4 June 2020,"This movie had me in tears and is so relevant now. The ending message is so important at a time like this. The acting was phenomenal. I have not read the book, so am unable to compare the two. Jamie Foxx's acting was incredible. Do not pay attention to the reviews which say no new storyline or nothing groundbreaking. The racism and flaws prevalent in our criminal justice system deserve to be highlighted and emphasized time and time again. The characters in this movie are REAL people and that makes it all the more heart wrenching and impactful.",Just Mercy
394,obizuochinwendu,Fantastic,9,9 July 2020,This movie is just so amazing. I can't believe this is actually a true life story. Black lives matter,Just Mercy
395,pavangupta-96611,Slow but worth watching,10,14 August 2020,This is a Great true story. It has Great cast. Great work done.,Just Mercy
396,johnandmina,Read the book!,8,7 October 2020,"As much as I enjoyed the movie, they had to simplify/ summarize/ leave out much of the book in order to tell the story in 2 hours. If you want to learn more about Bryan Stevenson and the Equal Justice Initiative, I highly recommend the book Just Mercy.",Just Mercy
397,ammuhema-12436,Humanity still prevails,10,9 October 2020,This story is a great example of how we as humans rise together by helping each other. It just seeps it's way into the bottom of your heart. We need more people like Bryan Stevenson fighting for all the good left in this world. I believe every one of us watching this would be moved to the core.,Just Mercy
398,sread-09919,Good,7,16 October 2020,Good. Only problem is at the start the years and timings were quite confusing,Just Mercy
399,woehlerangie,Sad but good,9,20 October 2020,"I thought this was a really great movie! It seemed a tad long to me so I was surprised it is only 2hr 17 min long, seemed longer. Some parts seemed to drag on a bit but overall I thought it was so good. It made me cry for sure. The acting in it is great. Would recommend!",Just Mercy
400,ameliaperring,Must watch. Absolutely must watch.,10,28 November 2020,"I didn't have much of an idea going into and watching this movie. I was absolutely speechless. I cried for the entire remaining hour of the film. It drove me and my mind to places I had never been. It was beautiful and terrifying.
The minute it stopped (and I regathered myself) I ordered the novel. I cannot wait to read this",Just Mercy
401,lisablr,A very moving film,10,9 April 2021,"Just Mercy is a movie that is really harsh to watch. It tackles the issue of racial justice in the USA in the 80ies and reveals all the injustice, violence, and hardships that black people had to endure. All along the film, we go through all emotions, hate, fury, pain, or joy. This is very poignant. Indeed, Just Mercy provokes the same feeling of shame, hate and anger as the novel To Kill the Mocking Bird by Harper Lee which took place in the 30ies. This gratuitious humiliation towards the blacks, was for me, so cruel. This film is a real portrait of the American justice in the southern states. I highly recommend it !",Just Mercy
402,chinmayshetye-08795,A story of the true heroes amongst us,10,5 September 2021,"Brilliant acting, great direction the movie makes you feel the pain, the joy, the hope, the struggle.The story is the biggest asset which the director and actors unfolded nicely.Thankyou to everyone involved in making such a masterpiece.",Just Mercy
403,SusieStars,"Moving, gripping performance",10,10 January 2020,"I am astonished to see how low this movie has scored with the IMDb users, as I consider it to be one of the best, if not the best film I've seen in the last 12 months.We attended a UK preview and grown men were crying in the audience. The performances by the two leads were captivating and you really felt like you were going on that journey with them. The message of the movie really hit home and I have still been thinking about it ever since. Surely the film is going to win some major awards.",Just Mercy
404,cpeete,Must see,9,11 January 2020,"Excellent movie! Great casting, acting and storytelling.",Just Mercy
405,enetgirl,A story that needs to be viewed,8,15 December 2019,Everyone should enlighten themselves and watch this movie.And I just want to point out that these 7 reviews (not counting mine) average a score of 8.29. I don't know how they got a 5.7,Just Mercy
406,gizmokin,Moving and inspiring,10,30 December 2019,Optimism prevailed at even the darkest times. Makes you want to stand up and fight for what is right.,Just Mercy
407,Tanja_Boman,A good biographical movie,10,12 January 2020,It is a heartful biography (not just drama) that is well worth watching.,Just Mercy
408,jerry-stjuste,Justice is a slow process,9,6 June 2020,Very good movie shows how the saying innocent till proven guilty Doesn't apply to all,Just Mercy
409,annabee78,"My movie idea called,"" black in America """,10,5 June 2020,"I think we should use this and have a new movie come out called ,"" black in America "" based on what it is like to be a black person in America . Given what it going on with the recent black lives matter movement. It should have a black male as the main character and inside his head as he is being mistreated by police and other people around him. This movie should reveal the thoughts in his head as a black person dealing with racism .",Just Mercy
410,keithaglewis,A Hard Truth,10,19 April 2020,This is one of those films that some people may find hard to watch because it speaks volumes of the past and the atrocious ways people were treated because of the colour of their skin. I love films such as this as they do an excellent job of educating the current generation.,Just Mercy
411,justin-nikola,Just justice!,9,2 June 2021,"This is wonderful movie width hard and true story about a man who fought for justice at a time when it was not easy to do, and when the level of racism and injustice against black population was at a hight level.I give 9 just because the movie is litle stretched, and quite long.",Just Mercy
412,perkinsmay,Emotional and riveting!,9,6 January 2020,"I saw this film tonight as a Screen Unseen at the Odeon Worcester, UK. I too don't understand it's low rating on this website. I was riveted and at times it was a hard watch because of the blatant injustice explored in it. The performances were first class and Michael B. Jordan has a stillness on camera, which is arresting and powerful. I cannot believe that this injustice happens and that this level of bigotry and racism escapes justice. Everyone who believes in justice for all, irrelevant of your race, social status and wealth should watch this film and I applaud the makers for bringing the story of this courageous lawyer to the big screen to highlight how these prejudices still exist in the home of the free'",Just Mercy
413,pat-ricethepirate,Unexpectedly BRILLIANT,10,12 January 2020,"Not only did this movie exceed my expectations, it made me re-think a lot about life. I was hesitant because of the ratings, but I saw it anyways and was not disappointed! The acting, the story line, and everything about it was beautiful. MUST SEE",Just Mercy
414,craig_deroche,This is a powerful and well made film,10,13 January 2020,"Just Mercy is a wonderfully scripted and directed film. This film is not a documentary and at the same time it would be impossible for he viewer to leave without being personally moved and better informed about the need for change in our justice system in America. It doesn't tell you the reason ""why"" it let's you know why in your own heart through experience of the real-life characters portrayed in the film who are on death row and working in the court and police system in Alabama. This is not an easy balance for the storytellers who put this together but they did it masterfully. The acting is great and the scenes are very authentic 80's. As an almost 50 myself, I thought this part was was great.",Just Mercy
415,romil_mewada,A must watch!,10,27 December 2020,A movie that everyone should watch. Definitely one of the best movies of 2020. It tells you how corrupt the system has been against black people and how hope can bring change.,Just Mercy
416,katrina-holman,Just mercy = just wow,9,6 January 2020,"Had not heard of this true story before so i was glued to my seat the whole way through. Wow what a journey to get the truth! I wont spoil the story, just make sure you watch it, it's a real eye opener with how the blacks are and have been treated 😥",Just Mercy
417,dickgill2003,A few caveats but superb movie,9,9 January 2020,"It appears to be a fact that if you want to make a 'message' movie, and you have an all star big time Hollywood cast you must then expect an element of the one dimensional sledge hammer delivery with plenty of stereotypes and cliches thrown in. There must be exceptions, what are they? I'm also wary when I see 'based on a true story' which only begs the question as to how much of it actually is.
Having said that, terrific cinema, superb acting from the two main leads, I sat completely engrossed throughout (and based on what we saw at the end it was all mostly true).",Just Mercy
418,graceu70,Must see...,10,11 December 2019,Must watch.... everyday there are innocent people seating in jail without mercy that is wrongfully convicted,Just Mercy

420,nena-93,Absolutely amazing movie,10,22 January 2020,"I'm from Mobile and just can't understand why people are so cruel and ruthless, God bless Bryan Stevenson for all he has done Michael B Jordan and Jamie Foxx are epic in this movie absolutely amazing",Just Mercy
421,bnlieber,Will never forget this film,10,8 February 2020,"There are few films I have ever said ""I will never forget this one."" This impactful film is one of those. It covers relevant topics from America's past and present. It is thought provoking, insightful film about bigotry, race, education, our judicial system, the death penalty, prejudice, imprisonment, life in America for black people, perseverance, community, As a child of a holocaust survivor, I thought I understood so much about prejudice, persecution, and being violated. This is not fake news or merely reality TV. The is impeccably scripted and the acting is superb.
My only issue with the film is that the ratings are off. It deserves much higher ratings and should have come out before Jan 1 because it ought to be up for a number of Oscar nominations, including best film!",Just Mercy
422,petersommelier,Anyone who rates it less doesnt know film,10,15 January 2020,"Superb. Excellent acting, gut wrenching and moving. Powerful and well executed. Could make you cry. Must see.",Just Mercy
423,gabrielnilo,Great movie but is lacking,8,6 March 2020,"The movie is really good but not because of the beginning but because how it ends.it starts really good but then the pace is a little off when the lawyer enters the scene, he just came with no background and all he said is that he was from Harvard, the movie needed something from when he was young and the moment he made his mind to be a lawyer, it felt like he was not surprised when he should have, there are parts of the movie that he shakes his head contradicting what he says with his mouth and that made me mad !I also felt that the clothes he was wearing to run were too good for that time, it looked like nowadays clothes.I think that the major problem with the movie is how weak the racism is ! In the real life they were in constant danger and the movie made me feel like it was just for brief moments.It was supposed to be a 9 of 10, but it failed to be a 9 because it was a really good movie but it lacked reality and emotion in some scenes.This movie is not good as it could be.",Just Mercy
424,alshoema,Very moving film,10,21 January 2020,"Happily shared this film with my children on MLK Jr. Day to teach them about some of the continued work needed to achieve his dreams of equality. I highly recommend this film, and hope that many will see it. Such an important message.",Just Mercy
425,vickiesullivan,An excellent account of how systematic racism still reverberates throughout US police/legal system,10,12 June 2020,"Lawyer, Bryan Stevenson, persists in what appears a losing battle to fight a morally corrupt police and legal system. I recommend this film for everyone who wants to believe systematic reform will prevent more INNOCENT people from being wrongfully accused. I'm glad they made this story into a movie. There was some swearing but movie was not damaged by obnoxious righteous pontificating-just a reveal of truth.",Just Mercy
426,missionaryever,A MUST SEE!,10,5 March 2020,"If you love true stories, then you must watch this movie. The Director did a phenomenal job of making you feel what the people in death row feel.
It captivated me, it starts a little slow, but then you dont want to let go, you want justice to be done.
Watch it you won't regret it!",Just Mercy
427,tls-11806,Must See,7,12 January 2020,"If you don't know anything about the EJI, then go watch this movie. If you like Michael B. Jordan and Jamir Fox then you will love this movie. Acting was well do e in my opinion and how I'm still amazed how the law in Alabama was/is so Backwards. I would go see this again In a heartbeat.",Just Mercy
428,bobby-81135,Oscar worthy performances,10,18 March 2020,"I just finished this movie knowing nothing about it and I have to say I thought it was amazing.. upsetting and uplifting at the same time. Its even more emotional knowing that it's true, I dont leave reviews much but this movie was worth it.. must watch",Just Mercy

432,karlijaay,Powerful film,10,26 September 2021,"This movie captivated me from the start, it is so powerful and shows how unfair the system is towards some people.
