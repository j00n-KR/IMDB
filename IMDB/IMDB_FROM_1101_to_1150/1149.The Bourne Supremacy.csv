0,TheLittleSongbird,"Very much a worthy sequel, every bit as good as 'The Bourne Identity'",8,19 June 2017,"'The Bourne Identity' was a very pleasant surprise, giving a fairly well-worn genre a much needed freshness. It had its imperfections, but was a very solid and even very good film with much to recommend and introduced a cast-against-type Matt Damon in one of his best roles.It is up for debate as to whether 'The Bourne Identity's' first sequel 'The Bourne Supremacy' is better or weaker. To me, both films are about equal with a couple of improvements at the same time being achieved in 'The Bourne Supremacy'. 'The Bourne Supremacy' may lack the freshness that most of 'The Bourne Identity' had, in terms of basic structure it's a little samey if not exactly routine. The editing, using the shaky camera technique that tends to not sit well with me, does have instances where it does get a bit dizzying and too much. Really didn't like how underused Franka Potente, who brought such a great gutsiness in 'The Bourne Identity' and her and Damon's chemistry doesn't have the chance to register.As aforementioned, along the way there are improvements. The supporting cast have more rounded and better developed characters, with the actors having more to do. The final act in 'The Bourne Supremacy' is more cohesive, more consistent and less cliché-ridden than 'The Bourne Identity' got towards its end. There is also even more substance and emotion thanks to more emphasis on that and the plotting characterisation than the more action-packed (but still intelligent and exciting) 'The Bourne Identity'.Visually, like 'The Bourne Identity', 'The Bourne Supremacy' looks slick and stylish with even more breath-taking locations. The editing and camera-work are not perfect, but mostly the technique did intensify the intensity and atmosphere and didn't make anything incomprehensible, some of it is used more artfully than most times shaky cam is used (too often abused to excessive lengths). When it was a problem it wasn't constant and more than not there wasn't a problem. And this, and in no way is this intended to sound superior or conceited, is coming from an epileptic.Music score is even more dynamic, atmosphere enhancing and more layered this time round, while Paul Greengrass' drama-documentary style and background to his directing is used to full advantage. The script has more prominence here, and is sharp and intelligent without being too talky in a more script and plot heavy instalment. The story is exciting and thrilling with relentless pacing, poignant and dark emotion and with nothing too hard to follow.Despite less of an emphasis the action is very diverting and choreographed and performed beautifully. The final action sequence and the subway scene have a real adrenaline-rush quality, and in no way does the action strain credibility or get too bombastic while still delivering splendidly on the fun and thrills to edge-of-your-seat effect.All the characters engage and are interesting, with Bourne well-established in development and the supporting cast have more to do and in general are better utilised. Matt Damon continues to impress in a departure role that proves to be one of his best. In support, Joan Allen steals every scene she's in and Brian Cox is given room for more menace and dimension this time. Karl Urban is chillingly cold-blooded. Only the underusing of Potente disappoints in this particular element.All in all, a worthy sequel that is just as good (on the same level pretty much) as its very good predecessor. 8/10 Bethany Cox",The Bourne Supremacy
1,Leofwine_draca,One of my all-time favourite thrillers,10,12 December 2015,"THE BOURNE SUPREMACY takes up where the first film left off, offering a much more rounded movie which easily surpasses the first. Whereas the first film's strength lay in the many action set-pieces which proved that modern Hollywood films could still offer originality and excitement, the sequel focuses on the emotions of the dwindling cast, investing each character with believable motives and a real humanity. The result is a film which offers both top-notch action and drama at the same time, making it THE film of 2004.Matt Damon is far better than in the first film, his Bourne a grieving, violent ex-assassin with a heart this time. The supporting cast members, both old and new, are great as well; Joan Allen as the government chief of operations is good value whilst Brian Cox has material to work with this time. Best of all is relative newcomer Karl Urban, who is quite excellent as the Russian assassin on Bourne's trail, as good a killer as Bourne himself. The film really excels in the camera-work and direction, offering surprise after surprise to make you jolt in your seat and the biggest surprise is how adept director Paul Greengrass is at delivering excellent action and thrills.The opening chase is breathlessly exciting whilst the closing cat-and-mouse game, both on foot and by car, is quite simply the best I've watched. Realism is spot-on and the lack of computer effects – all stunts were performed by Damon, and 'really happened' – make it feel all the more true-to-life. The script offers one or two neat twists and overall the film has a feeling of originality and edginess that so many others lack. A real winner of a movie and one I've watched time and again, enjoying it 100% in each instance.",The Bourne Supremacy
2,SnoopyStyle,good Paul Greengrass action,7,28 October 2013,"Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and Marie (Franka Potente) are living off the radar. He's still haunted by his partly forgotten past. But then the hidden world comes and destroy their small bit of happiness. A CIA plan under Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) gets double crossed and Jason Bourne gets framed for it. Jason must return to clear the mess.This is the return of a complicated plot. It's tough to follow watching the first time around. What the audience gets is director Paul Greengrass' expert grasp on action, and Jason Bourne's robotic efficiency. What's missing is the warmth of a love story with Marie. It's a rather cold desolation that could have used more fire of anger and vengeance.",The Bourne Supremacy
3,Hitchcoc,Carries it On,7,25 January 2008,"It doesn't have quite the mystery and intrigue of the first one, but still does a nice storytelling job. Most of the time I wonder who these guys are who are willing to become cannon fodder for a cause. Are they being paid really well. Have they been brainwashed. Are they out of the terrorist/suicide bomber school. They are there to do harm and for whom. This movie keeps a personal slant on this. Bourne deep down inside doesn't want to kill. But he's been put on this roller coast, given no choice, and is still bewildered by his situation. To quote another film from a long time ago, ""Who are these guys?"" Here Bourne just wants to live his life. He knows he's in the cross hairs but chooses to back off and try to live a normal life. They just won't let him. Once again, there is very nice acting and some wonderful scenes, chases, narrow escapes, etc. A very good action film with some mystery to it.",The Bourne Supremacy
4,claudio_carvalho,"Good Sequel of ""The Bourne Identity""",7,9 April 2005,"In India, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and Marie (Franka Potente) are found by the Russian hit-man Kirill (Karl Urban) and Marie is killed. Meanwhile, some CIA agents are murdered in a huge operation in Berlin leaded by Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) and Bourne is framed, accused of being the assassin. Bourne escapes to Naples, and is arrested in the custom. When he becomes aware of the accusation of murdering the two agents, he travels to Berlin, trying to recover his memory and discover why he was incriminated. ""The Supremacy Bourne"" is a good sequel of ""The Bourne Identity"". The film is shot in many wonderful locations in Europe and in New York, is full of action (and the usual exaggeration in action films), the complex story is well tied up and hooks the attention of the viewer until the last scene. The excellent cast is indeed a constellation of stars, having names such as the magnificent Joan Allen, Julia Stiles, Franka Potente and Brian Cox among others. The Russian BMW cab is a fantastic car: after many collisions, it does not present any mechanical trouble. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Supremacia Bourne"" (""The Supremacy Bourne"")",The Bourne Supremacy
5,kosmasp,Story-wise the best,8,10 October 2007,"Of the three movies. Obviously I'm writing this, after I've seen the complete Bourne trilogy, but I won't spoil anything of the story here, so don't be afraid to read. One thing should be clear here: You should watch Bourne Identity, before you watch the other two (and those in the right order of course).If you do so, you'll get the whole Bourne experience and it's worth it (even if I rated the first one lower than this one). Matt Damon does/acts like Bourne, by now (the second movie) he's completely Bourne so to speak (pun intended)! There's a car chase/scene here, that will leave you yearning for more! But it's not the only highlight. A great addition to the spy/thriller genre!",The Bourne Supremacy
6,classicsoncall,"""This is a live project. You're a go.""",8,22 February 2015,"A worthy sequel to the original film, 'Supremacy' is a taut action thriller that reveals a conspiracy within the CIA ranks as the title character comes to learn more about his past life. You'll have to pay attention to all the players here and how they interact with one another or you might be left scratching your head. Major suspension of disbelief also required when dealing with Jason Bourne's perfection at doing everything - martial arts skills, speedy file downloads, impeccable internet searches, flawless evasion techniques and never a wasted phone call. Money seems to be no problem either, as his travels take him from India to Berlin, Amsterdam, Naples, London, Munich and New York without so much as jet lag. But you can overlook all that just to see that slime-ball Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) get what's coming to him. Jason Bourne is cool under stress and is always right where he needs to be to get the job done. A bit rough on cars though.",The Bourne Supremacy
7,gavin6942,Good Thriller Ruined By Bad Camera,6,1 December 2015,"When Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is framed for a CIA operation gone awry, he is forced to resume his former life as a trained assassin to survive.Paul Greengrass is a mystery to me. He has a nice script, a solid cast, and can make these great spy thrillers. We are now (as of 2015) up to the fifth Bourne movie. But he has this weird obsession with making his camera shake. I could blame the cinematographer, but I think Greengrass likes this. And it makes no sense to me. Even when characters are standing still, talking, the camera wiggles. Why? One thing that makes this a better film than its predecessor is the decreased role for Julia Stiles. No disrespect to Stiles. I loved her in the 1990s with ""10 Things"" and ""Wicked"", but she is not a great actress.",The Bourne Supremacy
8,jboothmillard,The Bourne Supremacy,8,18 April 2007,"If you liked the first film about the secret agent who lost his memory, then you will like the equally good sequel from director Paul Greengrass. Basically Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is hiding with now girlfriend, Marie (Creep's Franka Potente), but soon enough his past comes back to haunt him. Marie is killed by assassin Kirill (The Lord of the Rings' Karl Urban), and some bad guys have managed to place Jason's fingerprints in a crime scene, framing him for a murder. Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) is convinced Bourne is a dangerous killer, and Bourne needs to not only stay out of sight of their many spies and technicians, but he needs to convince them of his innocence. Two of the people who had connections with the agency Treadstone, Nicky (Julia Stiles) and Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) are not only helping them, but may be able to help Jason clear his name, and disappear again. It is when agent Zorn (Gabriel Mann) may be convinced Bourne is in fact innocent that Abbott kills him, he is obviously desperate to see Bourne caught or killed. Oh, in the end by the way, Jason does get his revenge for the death of Marie, he does prove his innocence, he apologises to the daughter of one, well two, of his victims, and in return for his help, Pamela tells him his real name, David Webb, and his date of birth, more about that in the next film. With segments of Chris Cooper as Conklin in Bourne's flashbacks. The chase sequences are still thrilling, Damon gets more aggressive in certain scenes, the Moby song ""Extreme Ways"" appears again, still cool, just a great sequel. Very good!",The Bourne Supremacy
9,ccthemovieman-1,Lots To Like - A Great Sequel!,10,10 October 2005,"An outstanding sequel to ""The Bourne Identity,"" this movie has a lot of what I like: interesting European scenery, an involving storyline of a man being pursued throughout the film; fun action scenes and very little profanity. Plus, some great actors. Man, there's a lot to like in this film!At first, I was a bit lost. It helps to know the first movie in which the ""hero"" is an ex-CIA agent who, having lost his memory, doesn't recall who he is and why he is being hunted down by friend and foe alike. There are a few great car chases scenes in here but some of the other action stretches credibility as there is no way ""Bourne"" could elude his captors as he did several times here...but it's fun to watch anyway.The herky-jerky camera style may put some viewers off but after I adjusted to it, I didn't mind. It kind of added to the hectic pace of the story. Matt Damon is very good in the lead and Brian Cox is an effective ""bad guy,"" easy to dislike. Karl Urban, a new face, also is interesting as the Russian hit man, even though he has only a few lines.The is one of the few films ever to have Moscow as one of the location sites. In fact, this Bourne two-part series so far is a like at travelogue. Here in the sequel, we see India, Italy ,Germany and Russia. Wonderful entertainment, especially if you are paranoid!",The Bourne Supremacy
10,rmax304823,Stillbirth.,1,12 June 2005,"Few sequels are as good as the original, but this one is really pretty bad, distilling out of the first version everything that was good and simply throwing it away, then adding some stuff that makes it almost impossible to watch..Take the title. ""The Bourne Identity"" actually had meaning. There was a question driving the movie -- just who IS this amnesic guy? Even the name ""Bourne"" added a bit of symbolic weight. This one is called ""The Bourne Supremacy."" Supremacy in what endeavor? And why supremacy? Why not just superiority? Or even equality? ""The Bourne Equality?"" I guess not.No one could fault the performers, who in other environments have been more than adequate. Matt Damon was good as Mister Ripley, and superb as the guilt-ridden junkie in ""Courage Under Fire."" Joan Allen, as always, projects a curious but appealing mixture of fortitude and femininity. Nobody else in the movie counts for much.The plot is more or less dismissible. Bourne is set up and then pursued by some corrupt inner circle of CIA officials and Russians. It has something to do with the privatization of Russian oil, but it all boils down to one long chase.What really dismembers the movie is the direction and the editing. If you can imagine Oliver Stone on meth, you'll get the general picture.There is, first, a terrible imposition of directorial self display during some scenes. A blurry step-motion murder. A zapped up memory flashback in negative. But that in itself wouldn't be so awful. The problem is that it never stops.The camera seems to be ataxic. I can't remember a single scene in which it held still. It wobbles pointlessly all over the place or it focuses on some unimportant object like a venetian blind while the action takes place elsewhere, as if the director had been weaned on MTV or one of those TV commercials for a brokerage firm or a toothpaste whitener. (""I was afraid to smile in public until I discovered Dentabrite with Endorphin."") Let me give an example. Jason Bourne is doing some library research. He's reading microfiche of newspaper items in Russian and English and turns up some important information. The camera shows us the articles and the associated photographs -- but it WOBBLES so we can't read anything. There are dozens of ways of giving a viewer the gist of a story without asking him or her to read the details of the article. Erroll Morris showed us one effective way -- just hold the camera on the header. But this aimless wavering is positively irritating.The editing is equally poor. Every change of scene seems to be a cut, not a dissolve. And the cuts come fast and thick -- say every few seconds. Objects zoom aimlessly in and out of focus. And the director is given to lightning-quick pans, often past unidentifiable dark objects.If the direction and editing are a major problem during most of the movie, they turn into insurmountable obstacles during action scenes. A furious mano a mano shows us one-second glimpses of a fist here, a foot there, a knife skittering along the floor, a window breaking. The obligatory car chase comes towards the end, with the possible novelty of having been actually filmed in the gray streets and tunnels of Moscow, but the promise is unfulfilled. Each shot lasts a second or so and gives us mostly details -- Bourne's grimace at the wheel of his speeding taxi, a pistol being fired by somebody whose identity we must guess, cars chasing cars chasing cars chasing a car -- the movie should have been called ""Chasing Sanbourne."" (That was a wretched play on words. Can I take it back?) You know why the original ""Bourne Identity"" was above average, at least in my humble opinion? It had a better plot, for one thing. We were as interested as Bourne himself in finding his identity. For another thing, it had a developing relationship between Bourne and the girl (Famke Potente) whose car he hires. For another, there was violence, but it was not done to the viewer. The fights were unexpected, brutal, and staged in such a way that we could follow the events. And finally, the original gave us a chance to breathe between the zaps, an opportunity to learn something about the characters and their situations, about the kinds of music they listen to on a car radio.All of that -- and more -- is missing from this meretricious attempt to make a few bucks by tapping into the inelastic demand of an audience of viewers whose heads are as empty as their intolerance of boredom is great. I don't mean to cast aspersions on people who may have enjoyed this movie more than I did, just on the people who assembled it with that audience in mind.",The Bourne Supremacy
11,Tweekums,A roller-coaster thriller,9,6 December 2008,"It didn't take long to realise that this film would be quite different from the opening scenes Maria was shot and killed, this was a major shock as Franka Potente had second billing on the cast list. While that was happening in Goa a CIA meet with an informant in Berlin is interrupted by an assassin who leaves evidence at the scene which suggests that Bourne was the killer.He returns to Europe in an attempt to discover why the CIA are trying to kill him, in the process he learns that Operation Treadstone has been terminated and that he was a suspect in a recent murder in Berlin. When he gets to Berlin he ends up playing cat and mouse with the CIA who are looking for him although this being Bourne one can never be sure who is the cat and who is the mouse.This is one of the most action packed films I've seen and the way it is filmed makes one feel part of the action rather than a mere observer. I thought Paul Greengrass's direction was top notch although people who dislike shaky camera-work would probably hate it. The acting is great, especially from Matt Damon in the title role and the always excellent Brian Cox is great as a somewhat suspect senior CIA officer. The action includes several fights, a chase through Berlin and a car chase though Moscow where Bourne has gone on a personal mission that I won't spoil here.",The Bourne Supremacy
12,ma-cortes,Outstanding follow-up and with a similar premise to original movie,7,1 October 2004,"Bourne (Matt Damon) on holidays with his girlfriend (Franca Potente) in Goa are interrupted by a nasty killer (Karl Urban). Jason Bourne will have to return Berlin to solve two murders that he's framed . Jason will confront Cia chiefs (Joan Allen and Brian Cox) and he's only helped by a beautiful agent (Julia Stiles).In the film there are shootouts , emotion , suspense ,thrills , driving car pursuits and from start to finish the noisy action is unstoppable. The movie is longtime , two hours and some , though is neither tiring, nor boring , but entertaining ; it's fast-moving and packs a lot of bemusement.
Matt Damon interpretation is excellent as a hard and strong spy without identity . The ¨contender¨ Joan Allen is perfect as a cold Cia principal , as well as Brian Cox , and Franca Potente has a little role and she scarcely plays.The picture bears remarkable resemblance to first installment , as action as storyline . Adequate cinematography by Oliver Wood in semi-documentary style and steadicam and there are several locations : Naples , London ,Moscow ,New York . Unlike The Bourne Identity: Bourne case (2002), screenwriter Tony Gilroy read the book this time and claimed that he did a re-imagination, not an adaptation, of the novel. Gilroy wrote an original script using key elements and roles from the novel as a framework, though he replaced the traditional Carlos The Jackal-type villainous with Kirill. 
The motion picture was well directed by Paul Greengrass ,though it has likeness to the first entry . Producer Frank Marshall selected Paul Greengrass as director after he'd seen Paul's Bloody Sunday (2002). Marshall was after a filmaker who wasn't intrinsically associated with the action genre, feeling that Greengrass would impart an original spin of his own to the screenplay . Greengrass became a great director of action and thriller movies, such as United 93 , Green Zone , Captain Phillips , 22 july . Followed by Bourne Ultimatum , 2006 , with Julia Stiles , David Strathairn Scott Glenn , Paddy Considine , and Jason Bourne 2016 with Matt Damon , Alicia Vikander ,Tommy Lee Jones , Vincent Cassel .The movie will appeal to thriller fans and suspense lovers . Rating:6,5/10 Good.",The Bourne Supremacy
13,blanche-2,"Top-notch thriller, with Jason Bourne on the run",8,26 April 2006,"As a follow-up to the excellent ""The Bourne Identity,"" we have ""The Bourne Supremacy,"" with Matt Damon reprising the role of ex-government assassin Jason Bourne. This time, two years later, Bourne, suffering from amnesia, is trying to find out who first tried to murder him and succeeded only in killing his girlfriend, and who then framed him for murder by placing his fingerprint at the scene of a CIA operation gone bad.This is a dizzying movie - literally, as the camera never seems to stop moving. What elevated ""The Bourne Identity"" was its ability to surprise and shock the audience by a sudden turn of events in a scene -""The Bourne Supremacy"" retains that with heart-stopping effect. As Bourne investigates his old group, his memory comes back to him in spurts, sometimes at inopportune moments, but he still proves he's sharp at the game. Somehow we're drawn into Bourne's paranoia and feel it ourselves - this is particularly true in the hotel scene. The long subway station scene, as he leaps from track to track, is great. The viewer also gets to see a lot of Berlin during the movie.Matt Damon is fantastic as Jason Bourne, a confused man who possesses visceral killer and survival instincts. Joan Allen is excellent as the director of the blown operation who believes Bourne is responsible. All the performances are, in fact, top drawer.Directed at a brisk pace by Paul Greengrass, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is a superior example of the spy thriller genre.",The Bourne Supremacy
14,Quinoa1984,"a solid action movie, if not precisely as memorable as the first film",7,17 July 2007,"As much as I'm anticipating the third 'Bourne' film to come out into theaters, and as much as I'm not all aboard Paul Greengrass's style of film-making (mostly in due to United 93), The Bourne Supremacy works best as an adaptation of a book that, ironically enough considering the director, is good to bring along on an airplane ride. It's efficient and keen in how it observes the characters having tense talks on the phones (Joan Allen makes that work much better than expected, maybe the one improvement over the first film, as great as Cooper can be), and pretty well acted by its supporting players (one of the best scenes involves Julia Stiles, who was hinted at in the first film, who gets an emotional scene in a tunnel with Damon pointing a gun at her head), and it's even got one of the best car chase/smash-em-ups in the new millennium (the chase sometimes pops into mind when I'm in a tense traffic situation). But somehow it's nothing too groundbreaking, which maybe makes it just good and maybe just slightly unsatisfying for its potential. Not that the Bourne Supremacy needs to be a bold artistic achievement in the realm of international espionage thrillers. However if one feels that something it's lacking- and it's not quite because of the shaky camera-work, though I can understand how it can be seen as a negative- it's not to be unexpected. There's not the same suspense in the (anti?) hero's dilemma of identity, and so it mostly amounts to high-tech cat and mouse theatrics and a whole lot of attitude to go along with the potential of danger at every turn. It's not a film that I disliked in the slightest, and I might watch it late at night if it should strike my fancy. But as far as big smashing summer blockbusters go, it could be better.",The Bourne Supremacy
15,Coventry,Rockin' all over Europe!,7,16 September 2004,"The Bourne Supremacy is a sequel to the remake of a TV-movie and based on a successful novel. On paper perhaps the worst possible idea imaginable, but on the screen a lot of old-fashioned action-entertainment. In the 2002's the Bourne Identity, we were introduced to Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, an ex CIA-agent suffering from amnesia. Many mean people tried to kill him but he managed to escape with a little help from Franka Potenta (Lola!) and her mini-Cooper. Jason is still on the run and evil Russians use his coordinates to sabotage a CIA mission in Berlin, Germany. Jason is p****d off (who wouldn't be?) and decides to dig up his past once and for all. Paul Greengrass managed to make a highly amusing film, using almost the entire European continent as his playground. It has tension, speed and oppressed humor while some of the technological gimmicks make you gasp! Matt Damon shines as Bourne again and he's the closest thing to an action-hero we've seen in a long time. He's everything a dull and routine hero is not! Confused, emotional, incognito and  most of all  unfunny! No lame one-liners here and that's a relief. Bourne's portrayal might as well be called the best aspect of the entire film.

17,sunwarrior13,The Bourne Supremacy Surpasses The Bourne Identity,10,8 November 2011,"The Bourne Supremacy is a spy film very loosely based on Robert Ludlum's novel of the same title. The film was directed by Paul Greengrass, written by Tony Gilroy and Brian Helgeland.It is the second in the Bourne film series.It stars Matt Damon,reprising his role as Jason Bourne,together with Brian Cox,Joan Allen, Franka Potente and Julia Stiles. It was preceded by The Bourne Identity. The Bourne Supremacy continues the story of Jason Bourne,a former CIA paramilitary operative and assassin suffering from psychogenic amnesia. The film focuses on his attempt to learn more of his past as he is once more enveloped in a conspiracy surrounding the CIA and Operation Treadstone.Bourne has abandoned his life as a CIA assassin and has been traveling beneath the agency's radar, eventually reconnecting with Marie Kreutz, the woman he loves. But Bourne is haunted by vivid dreams and troubling memories of his days as a killer, and he's not certain how much really happened and how much is a product of his imagination. When Bourne is led out of hiding by circumstances beyond his control, he must reconcile his past and present as he struggles to keep Marie out of harm's way and foil an international incident with dangerous consequences.The Bourne Supremacy is incredibly fascinating and much more exciting than the first one.Director Paul Greengrass masterfully blends sight, sound and silence to do much more than entertain to the point that it leaves a deep psychological imprint.Also,it was an entertaining movie that has a well-constructed story.Together with it are brilliant acting from the cast especially from Damon,Cox and Allen.Overall,The Bourne Supremacy surpasses The Bourne Identity as it delivers a more intelligent thriller and satisfying story.",The Bourne Supremacy

19,Doylenf,Catch him if you can...he's still on the run...,7,17 September 2006,"Another chase thriller from Robert Ludlum's novel and directed by Jack Greengrass with customary skill at this sort of thing. By now MATT DAMON has the amnesia with the quick reflexes down pat, and he's still just as agile when responding to any known threat by the C.I.A. and the agents who think he masterminded a case of espionage that they're investigating. They're in full pursuit mode again and he's on the run and under cover.If not the most original story, it does give the viewer a chance to watch events unfold against interesting backdrops--Italian, German and Russian cities provide eye candy for tourists--but the fast-moving chase scenes are likely to distract from too much concentration on scenery. They're spectacular, especially a rather long, involved car chase that twists and turns its way through city streets.Enjoyable sequel is about on par with the original ""Bourne"" film.

23,writers_reign,Lingua Franka,7,5 August 2016,"As sequels go this is one of the least objectionable albeit it is more or less the same plot as the original by which I mean that Bourne is still struggling to discover who he is, still battling the CIA, and still outwitting them. For reasons to which I am not privy Franka Potente is deep-sixed after about three/four reels and only speculation is open to us - did she foresee a long franchise and decide to quit rather than play a one-trick pony? did she upset an executive and had to go? Chances are we'll never know but I for one miss her. As usual Matt Damon has some fine support by the likes of Brian Cox, Joan Allen, Julia Stiles etc and, of course, we know by now that there is more mileage left in the franchise with both The Bourne Ultimatum and Jason Bourne both completed and released to say nothing of a fifth title sans Matt Damon.

I love the story and I love Matt Damon in the role of Jason Bourne. Director Paul Greengrass (United 93) can build excitement like no other.The one disappointment I have is that we will no longer get to see Franka Potente.

The budget on this sequel stands out as we rejoin Bourne and his girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente of ""Run Lola Run"") living off the grid in India. Things rapidly change in paradise as a Moscow Secret Service agent (Karl Urban of ""Doom"") ferrets our hero out and goes gunning for him and ends up killing his girlfriend. As it turns out, Some sneaky Russians have broken up a CIA rendezvous and killed two agents.Furthermore, they have framed Jason Bourne for the homicides. CIA bigwigs Pamela Landy (Joan Allen of ""Face/Off"") and Ward Abbott (Brian Cox of ""Troy"") pack it off to Berlin after Bourne turns up suddenly in Naples and surprises everybody. Landry brings in Nicky (Julia Stiles of (""10 Things I Hate About You"") to help figure out Bourne's next move. The fight scenes are strong and the no-holds-barred chase scene in Moscow is one of the best. Damon turns in a robust performance as the tight-lipped, quick-thinking Bourne who manages to stay a jump ahead of his adversaries, but he is by no means means indestructible, and he displays some sympathy. Cox is a slimy villAin who kills his own without a qualms.",The Bourne Supremacy

27,Boba_Fett1138,No way near as supreme as the first.,7,5 February 2005,"I never really expected much from ""The Bourne Identity"" when it came out in 2002 but when I watched it I was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't a good movie in the sense of the word but the style was awesome and the action amazing. When I watched ""The Bourne Supremacy"" I didn't recognized any of the things I liked in ""The Bourne Identity"" back into this movie.Most disappointing thing was that the camera-work and editing didn't worked this time. The shaky camera-work and very fast editing throughout THE ENTIRE movie, only became irritating and tiring. I didn't expected to say this but it seems like Paul Greengrass was the wrong choice to direct this movie. Surprising because he seemed like the perfect choice after making ""Bloody Sunday"". It seems that he also already is attached to the third Bourne movie ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", needless to say that I'm not too keen on this. My suggestion would be to let Michael Mann direct but that is unlikely to happen though...But of course it is not just the camera-work and editing that makes this movie 'worse' than the first. Also mainly it is the story that just is a bit too complicated and uninteresting plus it could have really used a love story again. The movie also lacks some true bad guys and the Russian Kirill is not nearly as cool as the treadstone assassins from the first movie. Karl Urban plays a too boring and stereotyped Russian assassin. The movie also had way less action sequences (especially compared to ""The Bourne Identity"") than I was expecting and hoping for.Sure the movie has some good moments such as the car chase (even though the car chase from the first movie still is superior) and the movie has an overall 'cool' feeling. And it has Joan Allen playing a surprising and good role like you normally wouldn't expect from her in the first place.I still have faith and look forward to the third movie, even when Greengrass is directing again. I just hope the spend some more time working on the story and change the camera-work and editing more back into the style from the first movie.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Bourne Supremacy
28,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,The rare sight of a sequel that actually just about lives up to the original,7,17 August 2009,"I haven't read the novel behind this, or any other book by Ludlum, I'm sorry to say. You've probably already heard about the hand-held camera... yes, it's pretty much constant in this, even in quiet portions of it, and yes, it can be headache-inducing and straining. The worst is when it makes it downright difficult to make out what exactly is going on. I get that Paul was going for a documentary-feeling, and trying to make it seem true to life, but dialing it back a tad might have been better. The plot goes beyond what the first one did, and it requires a little more of the audience to follow. In general, this tends to race, without always slowing down to let the viewer catch up. The pace is fast, though not necessarily excessive. This supplements the story of Identity well. The new additions are all good. Every acting performance is spot-on. The characters are well-written, credible and consistent. Dialog is sharp and well-delivered. The action is bigger, the sequences longer and they get messier and less ""controlled"", without abandoning the special training of Bourne. It's made clear early on that this will be unpredictable and relentless. This is darker than the 2002 film. The score is excellent, again. This takes us to several locations around the world, like Liman's effort. I do prefer his take on the titular icon to Greengrass', though they both have a lot going for their respective versions. This has some bloody violence and brief strong language. The DVD comes with deleted scenes sans explanation to them, nine concise featurettes, four trailers and a Director's Commentary track that is very worth listening through, highly informative and gets into a nice amount of subjects. I recommend this to fans of those who were involved in making it, realistic spy thrillers and/or the franchise. 7/10",The Bourne Supremacy
29,evanston_dad,Bourne's Back in Business,8,27 August 2007,"Bourne is back.Jason Bourne, contentedly hiding out with his girl (again played by Franka Potente), dives back into action when a hit-man comes calling. Turns out Bourne has been framed in the killing of two CIA operatives, and getting rid of him would mean the CIA would be left with no suspects. But of course Bourne can't be brought down by a mere assassin, and the rest of the movie is another virtually non-stop string of action set pieces, culminating in perhaps the most amazing car chase sequence I've ever seen.Director Paul Greengrass could film a bar mitzvah and make it exciting -- his films are edited to within an inch of their lives, but somehow his herky-jerky camera-work and lightspeed cutting never become distracting, as they would in the hands of someone else. He has a nearly genius ability to choreograph action so that we're always seeing whatever we need to see when we need to see it, despite whatever else is going on at the same time. The Bourne movies maybe aren't lasting masterpieces, but they're small classics in their genre.Since Chris Cooper copped out at the end of the last one, Joan Allen steps in as the lead CIA agent on Bourne's trail, and she does a good job of looking hot and pensive at the same time.Grade: A",The Bourne Supremacy
30,Uriah43,An Interesting Continuation,6,29 September 2016,"This film essentially begins where its predecessor (""The Bourne Identity"") left off with former CIA agent ""Jason Bourne"" (Matt Damon) still suffering from amnesia but managing to hide out in India with his German girlfriend ""Marie"" (Franka Potente). It's at the same time, however, that a clandestine meeting in Berlin ends in two murders and the immediate suspect for these killings is none other than: Jason Bourne. Not long afterward an attempt is made on Jason Bourne's life which results in tragic consequences all around. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an interesting continuation which had plenty of action and mystery to keeps things enjoyable. Unfortunately, there really wasn't much of anything new or original that hadn't already been addressed in the first movie so apparently to fill in some time the viewer is treated to extended car chase scenes that seem to go on forever. Additionally, the change of location from Berlin to Moscow seemed a bit too abrupt and could have been better handled. At least, that is my opinion. In any case, there was still several good aspects of this movie and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",The Bourne Supremacy
31,ferguson-6,"Born to be Bourne, but no supreme direction",7,26 July 2004,"Greetings again from the darkness. I am a huge fan of the first Bourne movie and am now throughly convinced that Matt Damon was truly born to be Bourne. He has always appeared uncomfortable with being an actor (and definitely with being a movie star), so playing Jason Bourne is the perfect match. Bourne is uncomfortable, though, exceptional in most situations whether kicking the crap out of airport security or driving a cool little jeep through the streets of India. Bourne #2 delivers this exciting character into a world where both sides are against him - even his own side.What this one lacks is a great script and professional direction. Director Paul Greengrass seems clueless on shooting action scenes and we rarely know if we are looking at a kneecap, hubcap or ballcap. He seems intent on being stylish rather than capturing the essence of the action. This story was ""based"" on Ludlum's character and the story lacks any real spice. We know where it is headed the first time we see the meeting room with Joan Allen (at her usual ice queen level) and Brian Cox (delivering the best line in the movie - ""puddle""). Franka Potente returns as Bourne's babe, though her screen time and lines are far too limited. On the other hand, Julia Stiles gets just enough with her 6 minutes. Karl Urban is an uber-cool bad guy, but of course, this is Matt Damon's film all the way. Some great scenery shots of the world's great cities, but alas, the direction and screenplay prevent this from being all it can be.",The Bourne Supremacy
32,morrison-dylan-fan,The Bourne Series-Part 2:Supremacy.,9,11 August 2016,"Reading up about the Bourne movies,the era which I found to receive the most praise was when director Paul Greengrass took over the series. Finding the first one (also reviewed) to be a brilliant mix of blockbuster thrills and Spiv espionage,I decided to cut into the supreme second offering in the series.View on the film:Taking over after the studio skipped giving ""difficult"" Identity director Doug Liman a chance to return,director Paul Greengrass grabs the flick with an urgent atmosphere.Retaining his documentary/investigative journalism roots, (Greengrass co-wrote the tell-all book Spycatcher,with former MI5 officer and Assistant Director Peter Wright) Greengrass and cinematographer Oliver Wood crank up the suspense with blistering hand held cameras that place the viewer right beside Bourne.Striking the action scenes with a real crunch,Greengrass keeps the adrenaline running high via splashing lightning fast edits and jagged camera moves across the screen,which drink up Bourne's anxiety.Deciding to do a ""re-imagination framework"" of Robert Ludum's book,the screenplay by Tony Gilroy and un-credited Brian Helgeland (who got rid of Gilroy's idea for the movie to take place in the USSR!) keeps the action rolling at a fantastic pace bringing in shady double dealings,tense chases with deadly assassins and ""grounded"" spy action.Arriving as an unplanned sequel,the writers do very well at linking the film to the after effects of the psychological disturbances Bourne suffered in the first movie.Joined by a hissing Karl Urban as Kirill and a sweet Michelle Monaghan as CIA worker Kim, Joan Allen gives a wonderfully stern performance as CIA Director Pamela Landy,whilst Brian Cox gives the flick a great sinister edge as CIA worker Ward Abbott.Taking Bourne on again,Matt Damon gives an excellent performance as Bourne,whose silent killer skills of the past are given a regretful,raw gravitas by Damon,as Jason is bourne again.",The Bourne Supremacy

It regards endurance from a smaller factor. Jason Bourne is framed for murder and put on the run again. It opens with his hideaway life interrupted and his girlfriend shot by a sniper. Believed dead, Bourne embarks upon those responsible. Not as much brutality and mindless action this time out. Story is detailed and director Paul Greengrass does a fine job at giving the film continuity from the first film. Matt Damon reprises his role as Bourne who handles the action effectively but he also reaches for redemption in a wonderful closing scene. Joan Allen is splendid as the agency head in pursuit of Bourne but she is intelligent and will learn the truth as well as realize that Bourne is several steps ahead. Brian Cox steals scenes as a villain whose dismiss seems like a cop out. Unfortunately Franka Potente as Bourne's girlfriend is too brief. Julia Stiles has an increased role working for the organization that monitors him. The fact that this film goes more for plot over constant action is a big plus. It makes for an otherwise more intelligent film than the first. This is still a basic sequel but with tense action and suspense allow it to rein supreme over the original.

34,movieman_kev,reigns supreme among other early 2000 action movies,9,24 April 2008,"Matt Damon is back as Jason Bourne in this superb sequel to the great ""Bourne Identity*.This movie starts pretty much where the previous one left off, with Bourne trying to live a simply life in the quiet village of Goa, India with Marie (Franka Potente of ""Run Lola Run"", ""Blow"", and ""Anatomy""). and trying to piece together his nightmares and memories of his still mostly forgotten life. But shortly thereafter he is found by an assassin resulting in the death of a loved one, so now true to his word that ""if I even feel somebody behind me, there is no measure to how fast and how hard I will bring this fight to your doorstep."" from the previous film, he again must take up arms and see to it that the people responsible must pay.Whereas while going into the first film wondering and slightly hesitant to know if Matt Damon could pull an action film role off, I want into ""Supremecy"" knowing that this was one part Damon was born to play and he didn't disappoint. In fact all the actors, from Brian Cox all the way down to Franka Potente played their parts with equal aplomb. And the game of cat and mouse was both thrilling as well as captivating, if there was one major flaw in this film, it would have to be the way that certain fight sequences were filmed, at times borderline incomprehensible.

I wish the DVD had deleted scenes of how Bourne and Marie got used to using the Indian toilet if you know what I mean.

36,The_Void,"More of the same, but it's welcome",8,27 December 2004,"The Bourne Identity was one of those films that some people will love for being different to the average action film, but others will hate for it daring to be 'too' different. Unlike the majority of action movies before it, the first Bourne film, despite having stunts and explosions never put it's emphasis on them, as the focus was always on the central characters and their use of brains, rather than brawn to accomplish their goals. The sequel is basically more of the same, but it's a welcome return in my opinion, as cinema needs films that are different to the majority. It's also a good thing as I'm a big fan of Matt Damon. It's unfair that he should continue to get lumped in with Ben Afleck due to their friendship as he has a lot of talent and I think that the fact he's gone for more art orientated films as opposed to the dumb blockbusters his friend was drawn to like a moth to the light shows that he has a genuine respect for cinema. He stars as the title character; Jason Bourne, who, like the film itself is hardly your average action fare. He doesn't utter one liners shortly before or after blowing someone away, nor does he spend most of the movie trying to look cool; espionage is the order of the day and it works very well in the context of the film.Because it's plot heavy, The Bourne Supremacy requires the viewer to watch, and the large amount of talking goes some way to distancing this from most other action movies. However, this could also be seen as a bad point as it can, at times, hinder the movie in the excitement stakes and make it difficult viewing for those that do like their action. The movie spans across Europe to a number of different countries including Germany, Britain, France and Russia and this keeps it exciting as it allows the landscape of the movie to change constantly and the film doesn't dwell in the same area. In fact, the film is very efficient on the whole and it never overindulges in anything, which compensates for the amount of talking and allows it to be exciting. Despite it being more stealthy than most, time is still found for a number of high-octane sequences including fist-fights, explosions and a great car chase that looks as if it could have been lifted straight out of Grand Theft Auto.Overall, I would say that this is a slightly lesser film than the original, but there is still much to like about it and fans of Bourne will no doubt enjoy themselves. It's also recommended if you're sure that every action movie since 1988 is a Die Hard clone...",The Bourne Supremacy
37,mm-39,Lags behind the first film!,7,29 July 2004,"Spoilers!!!What a bad summer for movies, hopefully the fall schedule will improve.  The film has a couple of huge flaws.  One, the director, I can understand some of the shakey camera work in trying to create anxiety, with fast choppy thinking.  Real life events can appear to the mind in this way, with the sensory overload.  Trouble with the camera work is too shakey, were the viewers see nothing, and too long where the viewer either gets sick or confused.  The style can be executed better.  Two, the reason for the attempt on Bourne's life was weak, unless Bourne 3 will reveal a different reason.  A huge let down for the climax.  The crowd scenes, car chases, and fights with Bourne's wet work rival is the strong part of this movie.  The ending saves the lack of story, and weak character in the first half.  Why would they kill off all the strong characters from the first movie?  The Donald Rumsfield look alike is believable, and the brush cut, military/republican conservative looking agent gave realism for this series. This is like killing M in the Bond series.  I hope Damon will not have this Clariss/Hannabil relationship with the new CIA women.  Get a more original idea.  7 out of 10",The Bourne Supremacy
38,Mr-Fusion,Better in almost every way.,9,16 May 2013,"The rare example of a sequel that builds on and surpasses the original, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" ups the game and is one massively entertaining flick. Matt Damon has a little more to work with this time out, often playing a more contemplative supersoldier than the boyish fish-out-of-water amnesiac of the previous movie. What happens to the character in this movie is rough and terribly sad, and Damon wears the weary effects well. As for the rest of the cast, beefing up Brian Cox's role was a good move (wasn't enough of him in ""Identity""), as well as the addition of Joan Allen. Good actress and a good fit for the role. The killing of Marie so early in the story was a ballsy move, but proved a great way to get at Bourne and get him back on the offensive. Having her tag along again as our main character globe-hops would've felt like a retread and slow things down. They made the right call. On top of that, Bourne's frame-up that leads to a deeper mystery was a great way to sequelize the original movie, as well as open things up for additional movies. Solid approach. As for Greengrass' ""documentary style"" camera work and quick-cut editing, it does take some getting used to. And I can surely understand how it's a turn-off to some (maybe most). But it doesn't (for the most part) detract from my enjoyment of the piece, and it does add to the kinetic sense of perpetual movement that makes the movie exciting. Also gives the fight scenes a jolt, though they don't really need it with those brutal thud sound effects.It's in the car chase that the camera work and hyper editing goes overboard. This chase scene has such a dizzying effect on the senses that it is a bit much. And once the action comes to a close and both cars are crashed in the middle of the tunnel, you kinda feel that post- car accident disorientation. But Greengrass uses the preceding foot chase (a great one) to build things up. But the time we get behind the wheel, we're so amped that it almost flows nicely. But ""Supremacy"" is a hell of a movie; holds up incredibly well after repeat viewings, and even the reuse of ""Extreme Ways"" for the end credits is still a fist-pump of an ending. It's definitely my favorite of the series. 9/10",The Bourne Supremacy
39,christopher-underwood,with a Brit director we get a much more traditional American thriller,6,17 September 2007,"How ironic, the first Bourne film had an unmistakable European feel to it, with its Paris streets and 'real' people relating to each other and struggling to survive and here with a Brit director we get a much more traditional American thriller. It's still a fairly exciting ride but the camera-work is too self consciously 'arty' and the dialogue is crap. I agree with others that some of the fight scenes are so badly shot, with the priority to make them look 'cool' that it's often hard to tell what is happening to who. It's not down and out bad but it seems such a shame after the surprise pleasure of the first that this should seem to slip back to being mundane instead of building on the good features of the original. For me it was a much better idea to have Damon relating to others as the film progressed rather than just a mean and puzzled loner who goes all soppy at the end.",The Bourne Supremacy
40,Smells_Like_Cheese,Supremacy,5,9 February 2011,"Ah, the sequel, usually having a lesser chance to be a great counterpoint to the original story I was expecting different from The Supremacy. However I have to admit that I was somewhat bored with this movie. Not to put the film down but for some reason this sequel didn't have as many exciting scenes as The Identity and a lot of the characters are not introduced or carried out as well, even though I have a feeling the cast and crew knew this was going to have another movie to continue Jason Bourne's story. So we continue the story as Jason Bourne is trying to live a normal life with his girlfriend Marie. You know the strange thing is I really thought that they used a different actress for Marie but I read that it's the same woman and I'm amazed unless my eyes were tricking me. Now I understand though why they needed the love story in the first film as it's the main focal point for Jason as now he wants revenge.Jason and his girlfriend Marie have been living in India for the past two years where Bourne struggles to recall the specifics of his first mission as a black ops agent. In Berlin, CIA Deputy Landy runs a ""buy operation"", spending $3 million to purchase evidence exposing the mole within the agency that stole $20 million in allocation money seven years prior. Before Landy's operative can complete the transaction, FSB agent, Kirill, infiltrates the building, plants a fingerprint to frame Bourne, kills Landy's operative and the seller of the information and makes off with the evidence and the $3 million. Kirill then reports back to Russian oil magnate Yuri Gretkov, who sends him to Goa to finish the frame-job by assassinating Bourne. Bourne spots Kirill coming and flees with Marie in a jeep. Kirill gives chase and shoots at the vehicle to kill Bourne but kills Marie instead, causing the jeep to run off a bridge and crash into the river below. Kirill leaves, believing Bourne to be dead, but Bourne survives the accident and departs for Italy to seek vengeance.I think that this was a good movie but like I said it just wasn't as exciting as The Identity, but then again it had a lot to live up too. I loved the addition of Landy with Joan Allen, she's a great actress and a very strong female lead. I love Julia Styles too and am very glad she returned but she never felt too strong of a character as Joan Allen's is and it's great to see that all of the government wants him dead. Plus we are learning more about Jason Bourne's life as well as his real name and that he is one of the most awesome assassins of all time. How cool would that be that you wake up without your memory only to find out that you're even more invincible than Chuck Norris? Well, actually not that cool but the invincible assassin that's tougher than Chuck Norris is pretty cool. So onto the next sequel as I've heard amazing things about that movie so I'm looking forward to it. This movie was alright but nothing special, so I'm hoping for the better. Like I said this didn't have as many great action scenes and the introduction of most of the characters as well as continuing their story just didn't work for me. But still I'm looking forward to continuing this trilogy.5/10",The Bourne Supremacy

Cut from the same cloth as the parent ""The Bourne Identity"", this flick is bits and pieces of a thin story squeezed between protracted periods of busyness which is long on mediocre action and short on human drama.

42,MovieAddict2016,Bourne Superior,8,5 January 2007,"First things first: ""The Bourne Supremacy"" film is almost nothing like the book. Ludlum die-hards should not expect a faithful adaptation. Most notably, a main character from the novel and its sequel ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" (I will resist saying whom) dies within the first fifteen minutes of this film. The geographical locations in the movie are far apart from those in the book, and the general plot is vastly different.However, as a standalone bearing only the Bourne name, this is a thrilling and competent espionage action movie. The original may have been more ""classy"" but this is more fun and more visceral - director Paul Greengrass' sickeningly chaotic hand-cam captures the fractured mentality of Bourne, as well as his physical spontaneity. This is a very different film from its predecessor, but in many respects, it's also very much a superior one.Allowing the first film to establish the character, Matt Damon takes Bourne in new directions here - still running away from his past while trying to simultaneously figure out who he actually was.The plot goes something like this: an assassin tries to kill Bourne at his home in a small African village, and instead murders Marie. Bourne retaliates by trying to find out why Project Treadstone is still active, and soon realizes that he has been linked to two murders in Berlin that he didn't have any part of. With the CIA under the impression that Bourne has re-emerged as an assassin-for-hire, and unaware that he has actually been framed by the same person who tried to kill him in Africa, Bourne goes international - revisiting locales from his past while dealing with haunting memories and the pain of losing his lover.Damon's great here - physical, intense, deliberate. Everything the character calls for. The plot moves at a fast pace and isn't nearly as confusing as the first film's storyline was. (The fact that the basis for the character has already been established is probably part of the reason for this.) Greengrass' direction turned me off a bit at first, but once the film settled in to a rhythm it definitely worked to the film's advantage. He's kind of like Michael Bay if Michael Bay woke up one day and learned how to competently stage action sequences.""Supremacy"" is indeed a supreme film of its genre - it balances plot and action while introducing another element that was noticeably absent in the first film: a human soul. The movie veers down the ""revenge thriller"" route towards its finale, but it contains an emotional twist that not many revenge-thrillers are mature enough to carry out. ""Identity"" was a solid spy thriller but ""Supremacy"" just improves on every aspect of the previous film, and ends enticingly.",The Bourne Supremacy

Bourne is forced to utilize his trained knowledge and actions skills to survive while attempting to regain his past memories.The film picks up steam almost immediately where Jason Bourne is still being haunted by his unknown past, followed by the introduction of CIA Deputy Director Pamela Landy, who is leading the investigation into classified Russian documents and the whereabouts of Bourne. What follows is one suspenseful scene after the other, from Jason alluding assassins to him playing hide-and-seek with the CIA. Much intrigue is generated as the secrets of the CIA operation begin to unravel and Jason gaining more steam in unlocking his memory, creating a mind-numbing sense of mystery.The action scenes, from the fights to the intense car chases, are a finger-biting experience. The acting is well done; Matt Damon continues to be great as Jason Bourne - quick and dramatic, yet serious and witty. I also especially liked the acting performance of Joan Allen; she gave a commanding performance as Pamela Landy, committed to solving the investigation but sympathetic to Jason's dilemma. In addition, the visual and special effects were believable and the music score was riveting.Overall, this movie is just as great as its prequel; it has its unpredictable elements and edge-of-your-seat excitement.Grade A",The Bourne Supremacy
46,sddavis63,So-So Sequel That Failed To Engage,4,14 November 2007,"Although I couldn't say that I found it spectacular, I did enjoy ""The Bourne Identity"" more than I expected to, not really being into the action genre, and so decided to continue on with the series. At best, though, I found ""The Bourne Supremacy"" (the second part of the Bourne trilogy) to be only a so-so follow-up that for whatever reason completely failed to engage me the way the first one had managed to. I had a very strong ""been there, done that"" reaction to most of what happened in this movie. Car chases, fights, explosions and killings - but while those things contributed to a very good story before, here they seemed to lack any real or at least original focus. The story also seemed to me a bit confused - which, I concede, may well have been a deliberate way of keeping the viewer mindful of Bourne's growing confusion over his identity.The movie featured generally good performances. Matt Damon moved back into the character of Bourne effortlessly, and there was a fairly strong supporting cast, including Brian Cox (another returnee from ""Identity"") and Joan Allen as the new character of Pamela Landy - who, I take it, was the CIA chief in Berlin. I truly missed Franka Potente, though, who exited very early in this movie. I thought her character of Marie was one of the more intriguing characters in the first movie.In spite of the good performances, though, the main problem is the one I stated off the top - this just didn't grab hold of me. I thought it was worth perhaps a 4/10.",The Bourne Supremacy
47,Buddy-51,impressive espionage thriller,7,23 May 2005,"Matt Damon returns as secret agent Jason Bourne in ""The Bourne Supremacy,"" a first-rate espionage thriller that boasts a fine performance from the always reliable Joan Allen as well.The character made his first screen appearance in the wildly popular ""The Bourne Identity"" in 2002, a film based, as this one is, on a Robert Ludlow novel. Bourne is one of a handful of agents who have been turned into little more than mindless killing machines through a (now defunct) top secret mind-altering program. Despite suffering from a case of amnesia that has effective wiped out all memory of that time in his life, Bourne still has to deal with the guilt that comes from knowing all the horrible things he must have done while under the influence of the diabolical programming. As ""The Bourne Supremacy"" opens, we find Jason living in India, trying to maintain a low profile as he attempts to create some kind of a ""normal"" life for himself and his girlfriend. But, as always happens in these kinds of scenarios, reality intervenes, this time in the form of assassins sent out to kill him. As if that weren't enough, Bourne is also being hunted by some CIA bosses who mistakenly believe that he has recently killed two of their own agents. Thus, Bourne finds himself running for his life in a chase that takes him from India to Berlin to Moscow before the movie is over.With the Ludlow novel as his source, Tony Gilroy has written a complex screenplay that respects the audience's intelligence even when what is happening on screen doesn't always rate too high on the plausibility meter. Amidst all the convoluted plotting, espionage doublespeak and hi-tech hardware that are the standard accoutrement's for the genre, Gilroy manages to stay focused on the human drama at the story's core, as a man struggles to piece together the puzzle of his life. Allen makes an effective foil as the agent who first suspects Bourne of killing some of her undercover operatives, then comes to believe in his innocence. Director Paul Greengrass keeps the action percolating along, maintaining a high level of suspense throughout. He uses a hand-held camera to convey the desperation of Bourne's plight and the fragmentation of his mind, often showing us incidents and events from the character's own point of view inter cut with subliminal snatches of disconnected memories. In addition, the lively, hurly burly editing keeps the picture constantly moving forward. Personally, I could have done with fewer car chase scenes towards the end, since I have always found characters interacting to be more compelling than automobiles interacting, but I suppose that, when it comes to action film audiences, the beast must inevitably be fed. On the positive side, John Powell has composed a dramatic musical score that really knows how to gin up the tension at crucial moments.As an actor, Damon combines the seemingly paradoxical elements of strength and vulnerability necessary to make his character believable and touching. In Bourne, he seems to have found his perfect role.",The Bourne Supremacy
48,thesar-2,The Whole Series is Supreme,10,1 December 2012,"The Bourne Supremacy really wasn't the best of the three and screams ""bridge movie."" That being said, it was still an over-the-top exciting, thrilling, action-packed (boy, do I sound like someone who wants his quotes on the movie poster) film with above-par acting, suspense, intrigue and mind-blowing cinematography. Even though I call it, and it really is, a bridge movie between The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Ultimatum it's still highly recommended. While 'Identity' really is a standalone film, Supremacy sets the scene/mood: (no spoiler, as not only does it take place in the first 15 minutes, it's the basis for the last two sequels) Bourne is living in India with his love from the first film, Marie, who gets killed and Bourne is thrown out of semi-retirement to continue his amnesia-breaking quest, seek revenge and undercover the conspiracy of his beginning. Along the way, he's all over the globe, as is the CIA who believes he's part of an assassination and must be shut down, permanently. The best part is they introduce a new important character (of many) to the series: Pam Landy, played perfectly by the great Joan Allen, one of my all-time favorite actresses. She steals every scene she's in and enormously enhances the film and plot. Not to overshadow Damon, who continues to do wonders for his action-packed career builder role of Bourne. Sure, you'll have to suspend your disbelief, but what the (new) director brings to the table is a ton of action, feeling, heart and a true spy thriller not seen in years. True, Identity holds the honor of the best of the trilogy, and Ultimatum is oodles better, you still have to see Supremacy to get a better understanding of Bourne's mission.",The Bourne Supremacy
49,Lejink,Second Bourne,8,22 August 2015,"I found this sequel to ""The Bourne Identity"" to be every bit as thrilling and satisfying as the first. Self-contained as each film is, the continuity from one to the next is laudable in treating the viewer with intelligence and respect. The film starts quietly with Jason and his girlfriend relaxing anonymously, or so they believe, in the bustling city of Goa in India. Of course we wouldn't have a film unless his past catches up with him again and so it proves.Besides Goa, the main action takes place in Berlin and a recreated Moscow, with touch-downs in London, Amsterdam and New York too. It's not long before Bourne has a personal motive for getting back on his own case again.With super-fast-cut editing, often using hand-held camera-shots, a pounding, electro-soundtrack and a minimum of dialogue (I sincerely hope Matt Damon wasn't getting paid by the word), it's a breathless, white-knuckle ride with superb action set-pieces accompanied by scenes of expository calm. There are two thrilling car-chases, especially the latter in a congested Moscow and one exciting fight sequence in a confined space between Bourne and a fellow-agent.I didn't think the film needed the teaser-ending which finishes the movie on an up rather than down-stroke, but given that it set up an even better follow-up movie, I can live with that. Intricately and believably plotted, brilliantly edited and with Damon at his driven best, this sequel is no sloppy second.",The Bourne Supremacy
50,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,For fans of the original. Literally.,4,16 May 2005,"STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs Having ceased his services to the CIA, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is now living a life shrouded in secrecy where every stranger's funny glance and every wrong number he receives on the phone is cause for alarm. All he wanted was to be left alone, but a mysterious faction of the CIA still seems intent on hunting him down, in the shape of expert assassin Kirill (Karl Urban) and agency figure-head Pamela Landey (Joan Allen.) Aside from this, he also seems to be suffering from amnesia in the shape of the killings he may or may not have committed for his former employers. When his girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente) is killed, the stakes are upped and he becomes more forth-right in his efforts to come out on top.The follow-up to The Bourne Identity hits you straight-on like a bolt from the blue, hitting straight off from where the original left off (which might be a bit bewildering for anyone who never saw the original.) I enjoyed the first movie, I thought it was good, okay, if no great shakes, so I didn't rush out to see the follow-up. Strangely, Damon makes a more credible action hero here, though whether I've just warmed to him I don't know and there's a fairly neat car-chase at the end. But the sheer lack of emotional attachment to the characters, made even worse by all the funny editing and flash-cut scenes going on, makes all that's going on a bit over-whelming.I guess, much like The Lord of the Rings series, you may have enjoyed the films better if you'd read the books first, but I just don't think the Bourne series is translating as well to the screen as other spy thrillers of it's ilk, i.e. the Jack Ryan series or the James Bond novels. With another one on the way, that's a little worrying. **",The Bourne Supremacy
51,ElMaruecan82,The 'Bourne' Density...,8,12 March 2020,"Well, it didn't take long for Doug Liman to pass the torch to Paul Greengrass and adapt Robert Ludlum's second chapter of Jason Bourne's adventures titled ""Supremacy"" and released in 2004. Speaking rugby jargon, ""Identity"" scored the goal, ""Supremacy"" made the two-point conversion.Indeed, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is exactly what you expect from a follow-up to a promising spy thriller, it features the same amount of fights, chases, ambushes, killings and exotic locations (taking us from Gao, India to Moscow, Russia with a few shortcuts through NYC) and it provides more density to the pre-existing characters, more gravity to Bourne's existential troubles and a nice addition with Joan Allen. As Pamela Landy, she plays a CIA officer investigating the many loose ends of the ""Treadstone"" operation, the mysterious murder of a highly influent Russian and his wife. Both ways lead to Bourne and makes him the target of another cat-and-mouse game where Bourne is the mouse first and becomes the cat after, then a lynx near the end.There are two interesting things about Bourne, first it's the paradoxical nature of the character, making him a little more fascinating than James Bond whose timelessness made him predictable no matter how cool and confident he was, and hard to inspire a real emotional bond (no pun intended). However, Bourne is a man whose dissociative amnesia obstructed many memories from his past as a professional killer, which means the more he wants to know about him, the less he does but the more he tries to hide himself, the more of a target he becomes. There's something inevitable about the confrontations that occupies the final act, whether with the one character who reveals his true villainy, Landy, Julia Stiles as Nicky and finally, a girl who might not recognize him as the man who simply killed his parents.In a way, Bourne is a hero within the context of the film but with the background that has evil all printed on it and that's the trick with this character, his curse is perhaps his blessing. Still, he must face the game and plays with it as a sort of cathartic redemption. That's how he indulges to emotional breakdowns at times and loses his cool, while still being cool. The other blessing is that the amnesia didn't cancel off his skills and he's still capable to fool the enemy and lure them into his own plans. There's a great scene where he uses himself as a bait for an arrest because he knows that's how he will be spotted. The film might be labeled as an action film, which it is, but if you follow it closely, and close your eyes on one or two contrivances and some redundancy in the action department, you'll get yourself hooked by the stories and the many ramifications with previous backstories.To say that the film is a character study would be a stretch though: Bourne has a few quiet drama scenes, but he's a man of action, in a constant alert situation, spotting either the danger or the opportunity to get his enemies using not only his force but his brains (the way he outsmarts the big villain is unexpected and original). It's through his actions that we know a little more about Bourne, the film provides many information but they're never used as expositional samples. That said, one viewing might make the film look too complex and mazy and some flashbacks are shown like flashes of memories punctuated with blackouts, betraying some directorial teasing stuff. But it's not overdone (thankfully) and the presence of Matt Damon enhances the film, and so does the gallery of supporting characters with a honorable mention to Brian Cox. His interactions with Allen are top-caliber acting.And I will say what I said about the first, once again, it's about people who don't enjoy what they do: even the villain who comes the closest to kill Bourne is an average man who's paid for that and doesn't have the little edgy smirk or the flamboyance of a Bond villain. ""The Bourne Supremacy"" has this thing in common with its predecessor, it's straightout drama, it doesn't go for fancy catchphrases and one-liners and while it might seem sometimes too serious à la Nolan, it provides a nice feeling of continuity in tone and style. And at the risk of repeating myself, the film has no pretension to duplicate a James Bond formula but what it does (and does well) is establishing the birth of an iconic franchise, with solid entertainment and characterization and not much of melodrama, if we except the sad exit of Marie (Frannka Potente) and the last scene that seems a bit exaggerated but rewarded by the final phone-call between Landy and Bourne, and an interesting twist that I suspect might be the film's cliffhanger.The film can be watched right after the first and right now, I'm eager to watch the third opus. And if ""Idenity"" was a well-made thriller with a promising character, let's conclude by saying that ""Supremacy"" is a well-made sequel with a character that gains more density as we follow his quest to know who he was, in order to be someone else, and someone better. Yes, he might have a troubled past, but he's got the right stuff. In other words, if Bond is a cool guy, Bourne is a good guy.",The Bourne Supremacy
52,paul2001sw-1,Effective but empty,5,8 March 2008,"British drama-documentary specialist Paul Greengrass may have appeared an unlikely choice to direct two installments of the series of films about Jason Bourne, the amnesiac assassin, but his work has been widely praised. And it's easy to see why: his use of hyperactive, fast zooming camera work, frequent cross-cutting and driving music is very effective in ratcheting up the tension; viewers may find themselves physically flinching on more than one occasion. The problem with 'The Bourne Supremacy' is that there is so little content behind the high-energy frontage. In some ways, the tension is fake, because Bourne is more like superman than man, capable of getting out of what would be fatally tight spots for almost anybody else with unfailing skill and dexterity: the fight scenes, for example, are superbly choreographed, but surely bear no resemble to any fight that has actually ever been fought in real life. Likewise, the contemporary relevance of the film's message - the danger of intelligence agencies growing too powerful - is rendered vacuous through its assumption that such an agency would be capable of doing anything - tracking down people instantaneously, for example (or indeed, creating a super spy like Bourne - in fact, anything except recapturing him after losing control). We may be right to fear a world of surveillance, but it's hard to believe it would work with such slick precision. I was also irritated by the pointlessness of Julia Stiles' character, who is repeatedly name-checked in a too-obvious attempt to set her up for a bigger role in the final film. The result is that you may spend two hours of your life on the edge of your seat; but there's nothing to remember afterwards, although geekish fans of European public transport systems may never see another movie in which these feature so prominently.",The Bourne Supremacy
53,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Engaging, pacy and unconventional; a propulsive action-thriller of the highest calibre.",8,19 August 2018,"Considering that this is where the series really cemented its signature 'shaky' style and its status as a cultural icon - as well as being a stepping-off point for legitimately inspired work (including Bond, even) and cash-in copycats alike, this engaging and slick action-thriller doesn't really have all that much action in it - at least, when compared to those aforementioned 'post-Bourne' pictures, both good and bad. 'The Bourne Supremacy (2004)' certainly focuses much more on its thriller aspects than anything else, providing an intriguing and involving mystery (which doesn't match the mystery of the original but appropriately carries the torch and makes sure to place enough focus on our main character to always feel fairly personal) that allows for the introduction of some fresh and exciting espionage elements into a familiar but still fun formula. The only real issues arise with a slightly unrealistic climatic clash, an unnecessary - if frenetic and enthralling - fight sequence and the very occasionally difficult-to-follow camera-work, but all of these problems are certainly small and only slightly dampen the effect of a film that's engaging, pacy, unconventional (especially with its sombre and unexpected 'apology' scene) and, most importantly, entertaining. It isn't as good as the first, but it's a worthy, and distinct, follow-up. 8/10",The Bourne Supremacy
54,dromasca,better than James Bond?,7,7 September 2004,"The Bourne series, now at the second install have the potential of becoming a rival of the James Bond series. They do belong to the same category of international spy stories, taking us in all kinds of urban and exotic jungles, they are written around a well defined character, they originate in a series of novels written by a master of the genre, and with the James Bond series losing steam lately - who knows? 'Bourne Supremacy' is not a masterpiece, but is one of the good action films of the summer. It has a good script, it is well acted and if you accept the rules and you are after action entertainment you do not need much more. Some of the viewers in IMDb criticized the camera work in the action scenes - I actually found it interesting with the subsecond takes more suggesting than describing what is going on. For me it is he changes in pace between these scenes and the more psychological long takes - especially the ones in Russia reminding the Russian cinema style that make the film look different.7/10 on my personal scale.",The Bourne Supremacy
55,ThomasDrufke,Vulnerable But Vengeful Bourne,9,27 July 2016,"Supremacy builds on all the strengths of 2002's 'Identity' by giving Jason Bourne a much more relatable and grounded side. It's far from risky or overly original, but The Bourne Supremacy is as tightly compacted and impeccably directed as a spy thriller can get.Stepping in for Doug Liman is Paul Greengrass, known now as a master of suspense films, and Supremacy was one of his first gems. As I've said before, the original Bourne trilogy gets better with each film, and I think this second entry in the spy series may give us the best performance from Matt Damon in the title role. With his increasingly likable performance and magnetic charm, along with Tony Gilroy's well strung script, Supremacy tends to hit on all levels.With a bigger budget and seemingly more freedom in that department, I feel like the filmmakers wanted to turn the series in a slightly more action heavy route. Instead of Bourne being on the run from the C.I.A., this time he's hunting them, and the action steps up because of that. Bourne has more time to plan out his moves and hence the scenes feeling more natural and polished. With that said, the reason the action works so well, is because the characters are written with depth and motivations. There are no mustache twirling villains, you understand where everyone is coming from, even if you don't agree with their decisions.One of those nicely written characters is Joan Allen's Pamela Landy. Landy, a new task force leader from the C.I.A., wants just as many answers as Bourne as she draws close to the truth behind Treadstone. Unfortunately for her, Bourne is after everyone who ever wronged him, and Landy may be one of them. Much like the first film, as the audience you suspect what's going on, but it's far more interesting to watch the performances and reactions of the characters finding out themselves. That's a tribute to the acting and directing.At the center of each Bourne film is the performance of the great Matt Damon, and I don't know that he's ever been as good as he is in 'Supremacy'. The wide range of emotion and flawless action sequences that he (reportedly) did stunts for is impressive. The best Bourne is revenge Bourne and that's what we get here. It's always entertaining to watch him rip apart the C.I.A.'s attempts to take him down, even on the 5th or 6th viewing.+Damon has never been better+Joan Allen+Amped up action, amped up characters+Vulnerable but vengeful Bourne9.4/10",The Bourne Supremacy
56,MLDinTN,confusing plot that left me not carrying what Jason Bourne does,4,17 June 2005,"I thought the Bourne Identity was OK but nothing special. At least the plot was better and so was Matt Damon. Damon in this is boring and he only has one scene I can think of in which he uses those neat kung fu moves. Plus he does everything alone here. A lot of it is just him sneaking around in a black trench coat. You'd think he would have changed clothes or worn a disguise since they knew what he was wearing, yet this super spy never bothers to change his appearance.And the plot didn't make a whole lot of sense. I'm guessing a lot was left out that was in the books. Like why do they keep hunting Bourne when he just wants to stay in hiding. And when did some guy from Russia become involved. And why frame Bourne for murder by planting a fingerprint when he wasn't even trying to become involved.Besides a confusing plot, the other big negative was the shaky camera. AT times, you couldn't even tell what was going on. It was almost as bad as the jerky camera shots from the Blair Witch Project.FINAL VERDICT: I don't recommend it because it just wasn't very entertaining nor is Matt Damon any where near as hot.",The Bourne Supremacy

He returns to the assassin he used to be and while evading the CIA, he must track the Russians who killed Marie. The story was great and the actors did a great job acting. Julia Stiles and Brian Cox really supported Damon's great acting. The action was just non-stop and plainly high-paced. I also liked the nice European scenery. The first problem was that the beginning part of the film moved a bit slow, but the action camera little after. The second and the worst problem is the camera work. The camera was just very shaky and many people suffered from headaches. Myself, I suffered a slight headache. Otherwise, the film is good. I rate this film a 8/10.",The Bourne Supremacy

59,secondtake,"Fast, jittery, energetic, and a bit of a formula falling short of the first",7,15 July 2014,"The Bourne Supremacy (2004)Compared to the first Bourne movie (""The Bourne Identity""), this is a more straight up espionage tale. It has many of the same elements—the rogue CIA operative who is a highly trained machine out to kill, and a suspicious and uncaring CIA—and it is packed with at least as much action, mainly car chases and fights. And it is well made, combining great photography (right from the opening shots), fast (sometimes too fast) editing, and heart pounding music to rev it up.It's dynamic stuff.But it's also fairly ""routine"" in its own genre. In fact, the plot here is no longer an existential problem that matters very much to Jason Bourne (and his sidekick Marie), but rather a convoluted series of CIA plots that merely frames our here for a crime he didn't commit. It drives his actions, but with less urgency. And with unneeded confusion (confusion, by the way, not to be substituted for complexity, which can be a good thing).I also found the romance, or the almost necessary relationship connection (if you don't like the idea of romance) in the first movie really compelling—and again it is missing here. I remember when I saw this movie the first time at its release I was shocked and surprised by the limited role Franka Potente had. I like her as an actress partly because she cuts a different kind of leading female (a strong woman in a mode a bit different than Jennifer Lawrence, though both responding to the violence around them). But this will be about Damon as Jason Bourne against the world alone this time.The rest of the cast is a familiar brood of types, all welcome in their roles if not very original—the wise old spy chief ready to retire (and with some evil on the wing), a tough woman spy chief a little over her head, a sweet spy assistant who is smart but victimized, and of course the Bourne parallel characters—men/machines who are highly trained and dangerous.If you really liked the first movie (which I did) you'll probably have trouble resisting seeing this one. But crank down your expectations. If you find meaningless car chases annoying be prepared for two doozies—technically terrific as they are. And there is the basic plot, too, which may not quite be enough, the idea of fighting the unknown terrors from your old boss who now hates you enough to want you dead.",The Bourne Supremacy

When he figures out they are being hunted by somebody (Karl Urban) , Jason decides to take Marie, and get to safety. Marie is tragically shot in the head and killed. Jason figures Treadstone is behind it, but he's told that Treadstone is defunct. Jason is being framed for a CIA operation gone wrong. Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) is relentless in her pursuit of Jason, leaving him forced to try to clear his name. This is inferior to the original, but most sequels are! All you can ask for is some entertainment. I'm glad to say this movie offers entertainment in spades. This one may be more personal than the original. It has controlled tension, slowly building up to a crescendo. Once the action commences, it rarely stops! It's a real thrill ride that knows how to reel the viewer in. My favorite is the lengthy car chase in the finale! It's really pulse pounding. There are some really powerful scenes in this movie. The scene where Jason is underwater, realizing that Marie is dead always makes me emotional. It's debatable if Jason should have shown more emotion, but considering his cold nature, I thought it was perfect. If you look closely, you can see the emotion on his face anyway. Those that like good fight scenes will be pleased. Matt Damon is really fast with hands, and looks legitimately like a bad ass. My only carp is Paul Greengrass's shaky camera work. Some like it, but it annoys me. I hate the quick camera cuts as well. Matt Damon continues to amaze as Bourne. He's the perfect anti-hero. Very cool under pressure, and really charismatic. His no-nonsense act is a blast to watch. Franka Potente is adorable, but barely in it. I'd say she has 20 minutes. I hated that they killed her off, but I understood it. Joan Allen is solid in her role. Her naivety made things interesting, and I enjoyed her intensity as well. Brian Cox is excellent, but I predicted the twist a mile away. Stiles, Urban, Mann, are all good in their roles. Chris Cooper has a brief cameo in flashback scenes, but his ""soldier"" talk felt corny. This sequel is as good as it gets! It's a great story of revenge, and how you can't change what you are. Jason is a killer, but watching him show off a humane side made for some riveting storytelling.

65,The-Sarkologist,Mostly Running Away from Cops,7,5 August 2018,"Well, I didn't think that this film was all that bad. In fact I quite enjoyed it, but then again it is your typical Hollywood spy thriller. Well, it may not be quite James Bond, but then again the Bourne movies seem to have now produced a number of them (five I believe). In fact it does keep me hooked right through to the end, even though there are a few confusing facets, such as why he suddenly went to Russia near the end of the film. Of course, there is also the fact that he seems to be able to avoid not only every single police officer in Berlin, but also in Moscow. Still, that is the power of a Hollywood protagonist.
 Anyway, the film begins in Goa. Well, sort of because they actually set up the scene in Berlin first, but then jump to Goa where Bourne and Marie are sort of lying low (though I'm not sure if that is at all possible in Goa). Anyway, it turns out that it isn't actually all that possible to to actually lay low because he is pretty soon discovered, and of course Marie finds out why dating a spy actually isn't all that good for your long term well being. Oh, and we also learn that he hasn't received all of his memory back, though he does have flashes of going to Berlin once.
 So, it quickly comes out that not only operation Treadstone has been shut down, but Bourne has also been framed for the murder of a couple of spies in Berlin. Well, he knows that he has been to Berlin, but the fact is that he was in Goa when these murders happened. Sure, he might have travelled to Berlin without actually knowing about it, but then again I suspect that travelling to Berlin from Goa and back again in one night (without Marie knowing about it) is just not possible.
 In the end, a bulk of this movie is Jason Bourne running away from the cops, and also trying to clear his name. Okay, he does play the game of teasing the opposition but then again all he is trying to do is clear his name, and to find out a few more things about who he is - such as his real name. Oh, and then there is also trying to get the CIA off of his back, and also dealing with the former bosses that happened to be running Treadstone. However, as I have mentioned, in the end it is really just Jason Bourne running away from cops, whether it be in a car, or on foot.",The Bourne Supremacy
66,briancham1994,Energetic follow-up,8,3 June 2020,The second instalment in the Bourne series never loses its pace. It is as exciting as ever with a fast pace and well made action scenes. The story feels like it is escalating and building up to something huge which leaves the audience wanting to see how it all will continue.,The Bourne Supremacy
67,Rodrigo_Amaro,A Surprising Sequel,9,3 April 2011,"The sequel of ""The Bourne Identity"" takes the character played by Matt Damon out of his nice hiding with Marie (Franka Potente) when a professional killer finds them, accidentally shoots the girl and still goes after the hero. Bourne here goes on a personal vendetta revenging Marie's death but he's also framed in other mysterious schemes, one of them involving the murder of a Russian politic as part of his training with his boss Conklin (Chris Cooper's coolest character of the first film, here appearing in obscure flashbacks). To complicate Bourne's life even more CIA has a new agent (Joan Allen) tracking down all of his steps with the help of people who were trying to reach him in the first hunt, the Treadstone Operation (characters played by Brian Cox, Julia Stiles and Gabriel Mann). ""The Bourne Supremacy"" has many surprises, plot twists filled with action, thrills and adrenaline and a good story, always turning away from what we wanted to see but fulfilling our desire to see what happens next (the huge blow was Marie's death, certainly I wasn't expecting that). Change of direction means also change of style, and in this case not so good one. Doug Liman, director of the first installment and producer of this one, steps aside and gets substituted by Paul Greengrass, a more dramatic director with a approach with a documentary style, now well-known for his Academy Award nomination for ""United 93"". If the first film was more like an adventure film with many cool moments, the sequel gets a more dramatic and tense tone (Thumbs Up for that) but the editing ruins the viewing a little bit. Some of the action sequences lost their excitement butchered in the editing room, and also the hand held cameras that seemed more suitable to film an earthquake than this film. Greengrass controlled his editing team better in the third film as we all know, Christopher Rouse won an Oscar for his brilliant work in that, it resembles a little bit this one but somehow he managed to make things better (also comes the fact that Richard Pearson helped him in the second film and not in the third, so there must be something wrong here).Besides this minor complaint, the film goes very well although I kept wondering where's the grand finale of it? Something more exciting or interesting could be made of the last minutes of ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and that almost unfinished conclusion ruined my first viewing of it, but then I forgot about that because somehow this film gives us what we want, it is well made, take us to Europe, India, and U.S., has great sequences (the fight in the house; Bourne awesome tactics of fighting and escape), so what more I could ask? Well, basically nothing, and gladly they made ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" that was the perfect conclusion of a great series.In terms of casting, Damon goes very well again in the main role; Joan Allen plays a brilliant character (but she doesn't have the same bite Chris Cooper had in the first film playing a similar role); Karl Urban playing one of the villains was extremely hot and menacing at the same time; and at last there's the dark-obscured-sad flashbacks of Cooper playing Conklin in an uncredited appearance which was very relevant to the story but they could make these flashbacks sequences way better than just blurry the image. I guess that there are still people out there who want to know who was that guy.If you want a surprising thriller, with fantastic action sequences and some solid acting this is the film you've always looked for. To me, it's very good but a little bit inferior than the previous and posterior films of Bourne series. 9/10",The Bourne Supremacy
68,tomgillespie2002,Greengrass takes the series to a whole new level,8,2 September 2016,"When we left Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) at the end of the previous film, The Bourne Identity (2002), he had managed to out-think and out- fight the CIA operatives gunning for his head, and had seemingly found a happy ending for himself in Goa, India with his girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente). But the laws of franchise film-making mean that the shady types hunting him down the last time still want him dead to tie off any loose ends, and Bourne must again use his CIA- trained super-soldier skills to escape anything coming his way. Dumping director Doug Liman turned out to be the wisest choice the producers made. No disrespect to Liman - Identity was a well-made film - but the hiring of Brit Paul Greengrass took the series to a whole new level.Jason Bourne is still trying to piece together his memories - which appear to him in dreams Manchurian Candidate style - keeping a scrapbook in the hope of unravelling the mystery. One day he notices a man who looks oddly out of place, and Bourne's suspicions turn out to be justified as the man, played by Karl Urban, quickly tries to kill him, accidentally shooting Marie in the crossfire and leaving Bourne once again on the run and trying to figure out the plot against him. As we learn in the opening scene of the film, Bourne has been framed by some Russians for killing CIA agents during an operation overlooked by Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) to obtain some important documents on one of Bourne's previous kills.The film takes Bourne to Naples, Munich and Moscow, but what makes this series superior to the continent-hopping of James Bond and his quest to bed every woman he comes across is Bourne's skill-set, as well as the gravitas Matt Damon brings to the role. Whether or not he will survive the encounter was never in question (especially with the knowledge that this is part of a book series by Robert Ludlum focusing on the character), but what makes it so thrilling is the way he dodges every bullet fired at him and dispatches every brooding assassin sent to get him. By keeping the action once again grounded, the fight scenes are brutal and messy (Bourne even convincingly beats someone up with a rolled-up magazine). Greengrass brings his famous shaky-cam to the proceedings, and although it occasionally induces sea-sickness, it transports you right in the middle of the fight.Away from the action, a group of suits similar the ones in the previous film employ every spy trick in their power to track and take down their target, while trying to decipher Bourne's actions and motivations. It's incredibly similar to the plot of Identity, and in many ways to the next film, The Bourne Ultimatum, but you'll find it difficult to care that you're essentially watching the same film again when the action is this good. Greengrass also brings a dramatic edge that Liman failed to infuse into his film, with Bourne seeking out the daughter of a married couple he executed while still working for Treadstone in the hope of seeking forgiveness for his actions. That's not to say that Bourne spends the majority of the film pouting and brooding - the film is too fast-paced to stop and catch its breath for too long - but Damon does some great understated work here, and this is the main attraction, at least to me, of the trilogy.",The Bourne Supremacy
69,Dr_Coulardeau,The closing episode for the doubting Thomases,8,26 July 2007,"A second film to finish up the job and clean up the plate which was a little bit encumbered with unfinished leftovers. So try to keep in place in your armchair because on the screen you are going to travel fast and far. Goa, Naples, Berlin, Munich, Amsterdam, a little in Paris, Moscow, London, New York City and Langley of course. The CIA is everywhere. The truth is slowly appearing but in a very fuzzy way. Hence Jason Bourne's job was to kill some Russian opposition politician, but opposition to whom? But that kind of truth must not come out because the killing robots are real genetically modified or at least (human?) beings psychologically, mentally and physically transformed by some treatment, and Jason Bourne, a persona that has no record anywhere, except in the CIA of course, is being tested in his potential, we are speaking here of course of his killing potential for his eventual use in some kind of undercover war. When it comes out, or at least may come out, Jason Bourne becomes the target again and the chase starts all over again. First he must be made solitary, so his girl friend is purely shot in his place by some Russian secret agent, and then the old politician behind the CIA is running the show with only one objective: to kill Jason Bourne, and anyone on his own side who would eventually come up with the idea that this is a cover up operation for something bigger. But then the film becomes slightly humdrum because it is a chase after a chase, and one more chase after another. Run run baby the end is definitely close at hand, a few bullets away, a few stunts away and that's all. And all that to come to the trick played twice on the woman semi boss and then boss of the CIA: talk to her on a cell phone or even fixed phone and reveal to her at the last second that he is in her back and could have killed her twenty times at least. Security they say and competence they add. A scam in a tumbler.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",The Bourne Supremacy
70,Floated2,An improvement over the original,8,17 December 2017,"The Bourne Supremacy improves over the original as it picks up the pace and becomes more clever and action packed than the original. What it does more in this film than in Identity is seemingly less of a romance and love story, somewhat less talking and Matt Damon as Bourne is more bussiness and appears more comfortable playing the character this time around.The plot is similar to the original but here it feels more quicker pace as things occur right away. Perhaps a shorter run time made it feel better as some unnecessary scenes were cut or shortened. Overall, the Bourne Supremacy doesn't disappoint, as it improves upon the original and is a great action thriller full of twists and suspense.",The Bourne Supremacy
71,filipemanuelneto,"Personally, I think it was better than its predecessor.",7,23 July 2021,"This movie is the expected sequel to ""Bourne Identity"". Despite having another director (the first was directed by Doug Liman and this was directed by Paul Greengrass), the script was secured by the same author, Tony Gilroy, which contributed decisively, I don't doubt, to the feeling of unity I got when watching both. In fact, the points of contact between the two stories are evident in the way they marry and harmonize, forming a homogeneous whole.In this film, Bourne is in Goa (an Indian city with a strong connection to Portugal), where he ends up being chased and sees his girlfriend die. From there, he understands that something is up, and that he has returned to being a target to shoot down for the CIA, for whatever reason he doesn't know. Of course, he's been the target of a very well-crafted plot at the highest levels of the organization, and he's going to have to flee and defend himself as they try to kill him. Most of the film consists of pure action, with mind-blowing chases, shooting and tension: in an effort not to displease those who liked its predecessor, the film offers more of the same. Despite that, I felt that there was an effort on the part of the script to put more emphasis on the story told, and to give us a good story, not just an excuse for endless action scenes. For me, that's enough to make this movie even more interesting than the first one.Matt Damon continues the good work he started on the franchise's initial film, even managing to develop his character further and work on it better. If I found what I saw in the first film uninteresting, I am pleased to see a general improvement in the actor's work, and also in the material he was given to work with. Joan Allen was excellent at bringing to life Pamela Landy, the director of the CIA who, despite leading the effort to hunt down Bourne, will also try to understand her motives and understand the reasons that drive him to act. She is charismatic and effortlessly grabs our attention. Julia Stiles, back in the role of Nicky, a hypothetical love interest from Bourne's past, is equally happy in her work. Brian Cox and Carl Urban are also very good. In this film, it is Franka Potente who loses out, with her character disappearing from the scene.Technically, it's a film equivalent to its predecessor, with high production values and a lot of money involved. The pace is intense and things are happening very fast, so you need to be attentive, or you will miss important details. The film is once again located almost entirely in Europe, cleverly taking advantage of European filming locations in Moscow, Berlin and Naples, with a brief visit to the so Portuguese Goa, in India. The cinematography is discreet but elegant, except for the shaky footage of a series of very concrete scenes. The editing also has moments when it doesn't seem to be at its best, with several scenes out of order and successive cuts. The film continues to have many intense action scenes, with frequent use of good special effects, visuals and sound, and stunts for the most dangerous scenes.",The Bourne Supremacy
72,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Bourne develops ""supreme"" status in strong second installment",9,30 November 2008,"If you need proof that an action super spy franchise can handle a through plot line/sequel, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is it. It is a very true follow-up to 2002's ""Bourne Identity."" There is no re-imagining done by new director Paul Greengrass. In fact, he makes Bourne even better. The action is grittier and more realistic and the pacing just as intense and engaging despite a story that is a little more complex, being more wrapped up in Bourne's past than the first installment.At the beginning of the film, Bourne (Damon) is in India with his love interest Marie (Potente), thinking that the CIA program Treadstone that turned him into a super-assassin is officially old business and going to let him be. Well, they don't. In addition to someone coming to kill him, It turns out Bourne is set up for destroying a separate CIA operation in Berlin, so once again he's a wanted man. This time, the casting directors throw in another gem in Joan Allen as Pamela Landy, who heads up this mission to find Bourne. She's joined again by Brian Cox as Abbott, presumably the only person in the CIA left who knows anything about Treadstone. Julia Stiles also reprises her role in the film.Bourne is motivated by anger and the drive to figure out more of his past (due to the amnesia he suffered at the beginning of ""Identity""). He has fuzzy flashbacks that allude to his very first mission as an assassin. Of course it takes him all over the world and he's chased by police in about 3 different countries. ""Supermacy"" is loaded with car chases as its primary action sequences, all of which are done in style by Greengrass, who took the director's chair from Doug Liman, who moved to producer for this film. Greengrass uses a lot more cuts and hand-held camera-work to up the intensity of the scenes.The film really works as both a sequel and its own plot. Knowledge of ""Identity"" is only necessary in this film if you want a better understanding of Bourne's character and parts of his motivation. It certainly does make ""Supremacy"" better but isn't a must to enjoy and understand the film as well as how awesome of a protagonist Jason Bourne is. Tony Gilroy, who worked on the ""Identity"" screenplay, makes sure this story functions on all these levels. Damon also continues to give a performance that capture's Bourne's fragility despite his stone-cold action persona.While it's more of a continuation, another episode in the Bourne journey, it really does function well as a whole, stopping you from demanding more answers about Bourne's past. It also shows that clearly Bourne is the dominant movie action hero of the decade",The Bourne Supremacy

74,imseeg,This second Jason Bourne movie is a much darker hardcore sequel with exhilariating chases. One of the best Bourne movies of the entire series.,8,28 May 2018,"Jason Bourne's girlfriend gets killed. He swears to take revenge. Will he succeed or will he die trying? That's the story of this mindboggling energetic hardcore sequel. Acting is great, but much darker than in the first Bourne movie. Jason Bourne looks like a drug addict, with his dark eyes and pale white face. Matt Damon really did everything to make this performance feel like the last in the series. It wasnt. 3 more sequels would follow. But in this second performance Matt Damon excells in catatonic acting. You gotta see it to believe it. What I mean by catatonic acting is his depressed suicidal assasin look, which is very convincing. ""The Bourne Supremacy"" truly is hardcore stuff. The darkest and most energetic sequel in the entire series.Director Paul Greengrass restrained the use of the shaky cam in this sequel. Unfortunately he went overboard with that same shaky cam in the third Bourne movie. But in this movie the shaky cam really enhanced the feverishness of the action.Looking at the action, which is the main reason everyone wants to watch these movies, I really admire the exhilarating car chase. They dont come much better than this. This is truly feverish, exhilarating hardcore stuff. Editing, soundtrack and photography effortlessly blend into one contineous rampage of cars colliding into eachother. Action just does NOT stop. What a thrill. Mind you, there were no special effects during the car chase. No cgi, nothing. The real deal.The fight sequences were fascinating as well. Matt Damon uses an asian martial arts technique when he is fighting with nothing but just a rolled up magazine. Sounds soft? Not so, Matt Damon and his opposite actor tried it out on eachother before the take and were left with real life bruses. Following the bruises Damon even managed to accidentally knock out his opponent. This true to life portrayal of brutal chases and fight scenes really makes this sequel stand out.To summarize: YOU GOTTA SEE THIS. Acting is great, Action is great, Suspense is great, Soundtrack is great, Photography is great, Editing is great, Story is great. Really. I just cant enough of it!",The Bourne Supremacy
75,Vartiainen,Very good sequel,8,11 June 2018,"I still remember the first Bourne film fondly. It took the premise of James Bond, kept the larger than life spy thriller aspect intact, while bringing it closer to ground, so to speak. Instead of a suave English ladykiller gentleman, we have an amnesiac American, who feels much more an everyman. It was a good formula, and the film certainly left an impact.Which is why I'm pleased to say that the sequel comes pretty close to matching the original. The story picks up sometime after the events of the original. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and his girlfriend, Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente), have successfully evaded capture so far and are enjoying their life in India. That is until Bourne is once again pulled back into the world of espionage.I like that the film feels like it's continuing the story. So many sequels try to retell the exact same story, but in this it feels like they had a completely new story to tell. The events of the original are not ignored and the progression of both characters and events feels natural. Sure, there is a touch of maintaining the status quo, but not in a way that feels forced.The characters are also really good once again. I would have liked to see more of Marie, but that is largely made up by the presence of Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), a high-ranking CIA operative, who's looking for Bourne. Very much an MVP of the film.That being said, I have to admit that the original film had better action scenes and was sleeker all around. The action scenes in this are not bad, but the film suffers heavily from shaky-cam. Plus, the villains are paper thin and/or cartoonish. Not that the villains in the original very all that great, but they were at least passable.Nevertheless, if you liked The Bourne Identity, this is very much worth a watch.",The Bourne Supremacy
76,Turfseer,Good non-stop action trumps Bourne's moral turpitude,7,18 January 2009,"When you strip 'The Bourne Supremacy"" down to its bare essentials, basically what you have is a high-powered, well-done chase movie. For the most part, it's non-stop actionand the producers were smart to enlist Paul Greenglass as the director. Greenglass films 'Supremacy' in a documentary style, making use of hand-held camera shots in many scenes. One of my favorite scenes where you really feel the events actually could have happened is when Bourne kills a fellow CIA agent in Munich and then blows up the house where the killing took place. Not only are the sequence of events leading up to the explosion choreographed masterfully(the fight scene, the lighting of the fuse, etc.) but the aftermath is equally effectiveas Bourne drives away, the police are heading in the opposite direction toward the burning house which we glimpse in the distance.The plot to 'Supremacy' is more convoluted than complicated. In a nutshell, a rogue CIA agent conspires with Russian criminal elements to frame Bourne for two recent murders (also involving CIA agents). After a failed assassination attempt in India, Bourne escapes and is pursued by both the CIA and the Russians. Since he has amnesia, he's trying to figure out who's hunting him and why. Bourne eventually discovers he was part of a secret project called 'Treadstone' and was involved in the murder of a well-known Russian politician and his wife. The politician was set to expose the collusion between the rogue CIA agent (Abbott, convincingly played by Brian Cox) and the Russians.Matt Damon who plays Bourne, has very little dialogue in this movie. Damon usually gives capable performances but with little nuance. Nonetheless, the part calls for a great deal of physical action and Damon is up to the job. This is what he's good atplaying parts that require someone who's in great physical shape. What doesn't ring true is that Bourne is too much of a supermana killing machine that basically no one can stop.The supporting players here are equally as good. There's a lot of nice conflict between Brian Cox's Abbott who seeks to stymie Joan Allen's Pamela Landy, the CIA deputy administrator from discovering that's he's the rogue agent responsible for all the trouble. The Russian assassin and his boss are equally realistic as menacing villains.'The Bourne Supremacy' was filmed on location in many different countries including India, Italy, Germany and Russia. This gives the film a great deal of its verisimilitude.'Supremacy' wears out its welcome in the final scenes. There's a car-chase sequence that's been done many times before and goes on for too long. And there's an additional scene tacked on at the end where Bourne visits the teenage daughter of the Russian politician where he reveals that he was actually responsible for murdering her parents. Whether Bourne was brainwashed at the time or whether he knew exactly what he was doing, the writers succeed in undermining Bourne's heroic status and we're left with a sour taste in our mouths after realizing Bourne really isn't such a good guy after all.Forget about Supremacy's thin plot and the Bourne character's moral turpitude. If you like non-stop action, The Bourne Supremacy is worth seeing.",The Bourne Supremacy
77,Chris Knipp,More good fun from this franchise with a new director,8,12 May 2006,"Robert Ludlum's Bourne novels are a great basis for a movie franchise. Their hero has lost his memory. He has lost touch with the Who, the Why and the What of his life. Only the Hows of his training as an espionage enforcer remain with him as root instincts -- all the quicksilver alertness and killing and breaking-and-entering and language skills. This means you have a neutral action star. You can make up the plot as you go along. And since he's still in the process of finding out ""the Bourne identity,"" character development is optional and flexible. And in Matt Damon the franchise has found a rugged young star with the quality of energy, physicality, and neediness such an emptied-out individual might have.In fact character development in ""Bourne Supremacy"" is minimal and limited to recognizing faces and voices. Not a warm and fuzzy individual, our Jason. He'd as soon garrote you as kiss you, be you man or woman, and he may do both in the space of few minutes. In Bourne 1 (AKA ""The Bourne Identity,"" directed for maximum fun by ""Swingers'"" Doug Liman), Jason bonded with a woman he needed as a partner, Marie (Franka Potente), who was very nearly a match for him. But this time he's forced, early on, to let her drown in a chase, and though he attempts mouth-to-mouth underwater and sheds a brief tear or two later, he pushes her off into the deep without hesitation. End of relationship. There is no other, except for the telephonic one with his wouldbe nemesis, CIA officer Pamela Landy (Pat Nixon look-alike Joan Allen, not a romantic possibility).Bourne's idea of fair play in ""Supremacy"" is to go out of his way to tell a young woman he's killed her parents so she knows one didn't kill the other as it was made to look.The plot is not minimal. It has its intricacies, but we need not go into them here, and to do so would spoil the suspense. The mystery of why Bourne has done the past killing in Berlin that he's now investigating, and why part of Langley is trying to kill him again and the other part is trying to bring him in to find out the secrets behind the ""Treadstone"" assassination team and ""tie it off"" is the motor behind the action.The film was directed by Paul Greenglass, who made the excellent 2002 pseudo-documentary ""Bloody Sunday,"" about the quelled Irish uprising of 1972. His taste for vérité effects has led him to adopt a jumpy camera style with many zooms and closeups, which the editors augment with accelerated cutting. A warning for Bourne 2 users: prepare for nausea. Consider bringing Dramamine for the jumpy camera and jerky cutting. A lot of it really is a blur. If you are to enjoy the film, best to let it wash over you. Think of it as an art film. Imagine you're watching a video at MoCA or MoMA or Tate Modern. It's more a sound and light show than a traditional spy thriller. Greengrass's desire to achieve an original look and feel may have gotten away from him.Nonetheless it has many of the trappings. Like other recent efforts, you get scenes of mission control -- CIA HQ in Langley, Virginia, known affectionately as ""Langley."" Pamela Landy's effort to unearth Jason Bourne and figure out why he was ""killed"" are no fun for CIA old timer Ward Abbott (Brian Cox), who has a secret he doesn't want let out. So there's intrigue on the ""good side."" In fact as in the novels of John Le Carré it's not at all clear what the ""good side"" is.As in any good espionage thriller much of the fun of the Bourne movies is the locations, which range from a hot humid opening scene in Goa to a climax in the big bare snowy spaces of Moscow, with exotic travel spots like Morocco, Berlin, Amsterdam and Naples in between, not to mention Langley. And despite the lack of Bond-esquire seductions, there's the sexy former cohort of Jason, Nicky (Julia Stiles); and fleetingly, the cool Franka Potente.The charm of these movies is that you enter a room fully expecting a karate fight with broken glass, plastic handcuffs, and packets of neatly printed new fake movie-money American dollars flying about. Everybody has a minimum of five or ten alternate passports and identities near at hand. What a travel fantasy! With a ""go"" from Langley, you're off across the globe not only with the trip all paid for but a new moniker and an exciting mission. And all this is so far from any conceivable reality, espionage or other, that despite the speed and violence, it becomes surprisingly relaxing and enjoyable to watch.The difficulty of the style Greenglass has heightened, in which the first fifteen minutes contain a mood of panic and everything is edited in two-second cuts, is that it's hard to amp up the excitement  which is what any thriller is about (if nothing else)  and what you get is really increasingly eye-boggling. There are different ways of outdoing yourself. You could become wittier and sexier. Or you could just become faster, which is pretty much what ""The Bourne Supremacy"" opts for. The result is that the first quarter hour is just as good as the last, perhaps better, since it had all the potential, and much of the authentic non-digitalized physical action is wasted, because you can't really make it out till you get a DVD and run it frame-by-frame or in slo-mo. But still you've got fun on screen, and something a lot better than the average auctioneer with nothing better to offer than buxom babes, loud crashes, and Vin Diesel.

The story is called "" The Bourne Supremacy."" Jason and his girl Marie (Franka Potente) are hiding peacefully from the CIA and the infamous 'Treadstone' project which originally trained and left him emotionally scarred. Unfortunately, the company has returned to permanently remove him from its list of operatives and blame him for a secret cover-up begun by Ward Abbott (Brian Cox). To insure his death, Abbott uses an experienced Russian Assassin called Kirill (Karl Urban). Believing he has killed Bourne, Kirill informs his superiors of success. Instead he mistakenly murdered Marie, which infuriates Bourne and causes him to launch a most volcanic response. Realizing he is marked for death by the C.I.A. he uses his considerable experience and soon tracks down the woman in charge. Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) is soon in the cross-hairs of Bourne's rifle and wants an explanation. She too is unaware of what is taking place within her agency, but seek to capture Bourne to answer conflicting questions. At the same time, the agency, Abbotts' men and hundreds of police are seeking to kill him. The result is perhaps the most dramatic, exciting and certainly the most action-packed film of all. What can only be described as a fast paced search and destroy spy thriller on steroids is the essence of this movie. Highly charged and fully packed with speedy car chases, physical confrontations and cat and mouse intrigue, this film leaves little to be disappointed with. Added to it are emotional segments which reveal Bourne's nightmarish memories and his quest to learn who and what he has become. Easilly recommended to anyone seeking an exciting sequel to his previous film. ****",The Bourne Supremacy
79,freemantle_uk,Excellent Sequel,9,1 June 2009,"The Bourne Supremacy carries on where the brilliant Bourne Identity left off. This film series shows that realistic and intelligence action films can work. The first two Bourne films led to the re-boot of James Bond which I am thankful for.It had been 2 years since Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) had lost his memory and left the Black Ops division of the CIA, Trendstone. He was living with his girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente) in Goa, India. However, Bourne was suffering from flashbacks of assassination he did. In Berlin, Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) was running an operation to meet a Russian mole who had information about money stolen from the CIA. But this mole was assassinated and Russian agents set out to frame Jason Bourne. At the same time a Russian sniper attempts to assassinate Bourne, but misses and kill Marie. As you imagine Bourne was a little annoyed, but believe it was the CIA who attempted to kill him. At the CIA Landy wants to find Bourne and know why he 'killed' the mole, thinking that it was a conscripacy between Conklin (Chris Cooper) (who died in the last movie) and Bourne. She is forced to work with Ward Abbott (Brain Cox) who was in charge of Trendstone. Landy just wants to question Bourne, Abbott just wants to kill him.This is a confusing film at times, and needs multiple viewings, but that is a good thing because it makes you think. It has an intelligence plot and shows the willing of some people to use CIA resources for their own personal gain. There are multiple factions, Bourne himself looking for revenge and closure, Landy who was being used, Conklin, one of the main bad guys and the Russians. This film has a strong script. Like the other Bourne films, it shows that he is a top agent, also thinking ahead of time, and how resource he is. It also shows he amazing fighting abilities. That is always fun to see. Unforuanately, the directional duties went from Doug Liman to Paul Greengrass. Greengrass was a successful director on British television and for the most part does a good job with the Bourne Series; but can't handle an action scene because to the quick editing and the shaky-cam which makes you lost in the action. Why can't an fight scene be filmed like a 70s martial arts film where you see all the action? But there is an amazing car chase seen.There is a top cast. Matt Damon makes Bourne his own and shows the emotional difficulties he has to go through. Brain Cox makes an excellent villain as he always do. Julia Stiles retrives her role as Nicky Parsons and shows she is an actress to watch and Joan Allen a fine addiction to the cast. Other big name and especially actors have small roles in the film, such as Karl Urban, Michelle Monaghan and Tomas Arana.The Bourne Supremacy is the weakness of the trilogy but still an excellent film. The Bourne Series shows how a trilogy should be made compared to other series like X-Men and Blade.",The Bourne Supremacy
80,ebiros2,Outstandingly Bouring,4,26 December 2012,"Jason Bourne is brought out into action again because him and his girlfriend had been attacked. Jason goes to find the culprit who is after him and in the process starts to regain his memory. This is one of the most wooden movie I've ever seen. The only saving grace of this Robert Ludlum novel based movie is that the story is probably partially based on reality, and mind controlled super agent like Jason Bourne probably really exists in this world. Rcently declassified MK ULTRA material points to this fact. Bourne Identity was written in the '80s, so Ludlum was 30 years ahead of his time.Matt Damon is the most boring actor next to Ben Afflack. His range of emotion is extremely narrow, and that's what's making this movie so boring. The other actors are exceedingly bad looking in this movie as well. Maybe it's because if they hired better looking actors they would outshine Damon. This movie should have been better than the first movie, but the sequel was worse than the original, and is even less recommended than the Bourne Identity.",The Bourne Supremacy
81,dfranzen70,Still-Bourne,6,27 December 2004,"Matt Damon reprises his role as former-agent-now-with-amnesia Jason Bourne, who finds himself being shot at while in India with his lovely wife, Maria (Franka Potente). Who's trying to kill Jason? Another former agent? The mob? The U.S. government? Bourne wants answers, and the improbable path seems to lead to the CIA and a now-dormant super-duper-secret organization.The CIA wants to kill Bourne, because they believe he killed two of their agents. Bourne, as in the first film, still needs to know who he is, who's trying to kill him, and the relevance of the name Treadstone.Fans of the first movie will likely enjoy this second film, but fans of the second book (by Robert Ludlum, don't ya know) will be mystified, since the movie takes only a few basic elements from the book. Which is a shame, in my estimation, because the second book was pretty well packed with action and intrigue. The movie makes up for this by including a quite lengthy car chase during the final third of the film.Perhaps a different director (Paul Greengrass instead of Doug Liman, who executive produced) explains the change in pacing and tone; Bourne seems the same, which is good, but less seems explained, which is bad. Also, the action scenes are so fast cutting that it's sometimes impossible to tell what's going on.Damon still looks the part, and he does a very good job in the role. We don't see enough of Franka Potente, unfortunately, but we do get to see the great Joan Allen as the CIA official out to get Bourne. The ending's a bit too pat, rendering a lot of the plot meaningless. All in all, it's a good time waster, just not as engrossing as the original",The Bourne Supremacy

83,drqshadow-reviews,Best of the Bournes,9,8 August 2011,"Doing away with the whole hand-holding innocent civilian tag along effect that slowed down the original, this sequel concentrates on mind-wiped secret operative Jason Bourne, as he outsmarts the entire black ops wing of the US government at every turn. With the premise set completely by the first movie, Supremacy is free to quit worrying about the setup and dive right into fierce action sets and weighty plot developments. Though I noted several scenes that were more than coincidentally similar to the original, they were each amped up several notches and paired with enough original material to retain a unique identity (no pun intended). The story does a fine job of picking up on the dangling threads of the original and wrapping them all up into a rewarding, conclusive finale. There was a bit too much shaky-cam in the action scenes for my liking, but this was still in theaters when that concept was fresh and I must admit that, used sparingly, it lends a slightly more believable look than you'll get from the classic polished Hollywood fight formula.",The Bourne Supremacy
84,alindsay-al,great sequel to action series,9,2 March 2014,"For starts if you haven't seen The Bourne Identity then do not see this film until you have seen the first film because you won't have an idea of what is going on. This movie is much more action packed then the first one with the authorities from around the world looking to capture Jason Bourne because he is framed for a crime he didn't commit. From the beginning of this film it is clear that Bourne's isolation is a main premise for this sequel whereas introducing Bourne to the audience, however, this film is adding to the character. A positive addition to this film is the character Kirill played by the awesome Karl Urban. However, he is not in the film enough in my opinion but when he is he sells the fact that he is just like Bourne a deadly killer with no remorse but that idea isn't really explored. Instead the thrill of the chase is what makes this an awesome film and really establishes it as a great action film with this character who really is seen crumbling throughout the film and this makes it just as interesting as the original Bourne Identity.",The Bourne Supremacy
85,MaxBorg89,Bourne is back in a superior sequel.,9,19 December 2005,"Given the unexpected success of The Bourne Identity, a gritty, realistic spy story based on Robert Ludlum's eponymous novel, it was only a matter of time before someone started mentioning sequels (that there are, to date, three Bourne books certainly also helped). And so here we have The Bourne Supremacy, which retains the original's unique realism and stands out as the most compelling action flick of 2004.Picking up where the previous movie ended, Supremacy begins with Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) trying to live in peace with Marie (Franka Potente), the woman who saved his life in Paris. But while he may have turned the back on his past, the latter still has unfinished business with him: a Russian assassin named Kiril (Karl Urban) has offed some important people in Berlin and managed to make the former spy look guilty, prompting a task force led by Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) and Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) to initiate a manhunt across the globe. Forced back in action, Bourne must uncover some inconvenient secrets to prove his innocence. And as if he didn't have enough problems already, Marie is dead, accidentally killed instead of him by Kiril, making him even more determined to get through with his previous occupation once and for all.Shot in Goa, Naples, Berlin, Moscow and New York, The Bourne Supremacy is one of the most exciting races against the clock ever committed to celluloid, the director, Paul Greengrass, making everything look and feel so breathtakingly real (mostly thanks to hand-held cameras), despite putting his hero in situations most people wouldn't be able to handle. Luckily, Bourne's the right man, and so is Matt Damon, who plays the amnesiac assassin without trying to give him any unnecessary heroism. He's not here to show off, he just wants to be left alone. The film also improves on its predecessor by giving the supporting actors more space, thus allowing veterans like Cox, Julia Stiles and Chris Cooper (shown in flashback) to add extra meat to an already terrific job in the first movie and newcomer Joan Allen to shine in a handful of arresting conversations with Damon.With its breathtaking pace, excellent acting and incredibly audacious storytelling (the scene where Bourne tells a young woman he killed her parents is as bleak and moving as an action film will ever get), Supremacy is a spectacular sequel, raising the bar for the sure-to-come Ultimatum.",The Bourne Supremacy

He heads back to Europe (Berlin & Russia this time) and then goes gunning for agency higher ups, re-entering the life he had wanted to leave behind.The final car chase sequence with Karl Urban (as the bad guy) is probably one of the best I have ever seen, it kinda blew my mind, absolutely amazing.

90,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Perfection amongst spy movies,10,2 August 2016,"It's nearly impossible for me to pick a favourite from the original Bourne trilogy, but I suppose if you held a gun to my head I would have to go for the breathless, breakneck Bourne Supremacy. It's the first one I ever saw and one of the very first big summer movie experiences of my youth, so I have a burning nostalgia. I wouldn't base my decision solely on that, though. No, I've thought a lot about it, and Supremacy just has every element in pitch perfect place, every second of pacing hurtling by on full throttle and Matt Damon taking names like he never did before. I love the fact that Bourne has something driving him other than a need to know who and what he is this time around. He has revenge for the death of someone he loved, which is never something you want to provoke when you have someone like him gunning for you. Life is quiet for Jason and Marie (Franka Potente 😍) for about five seconds at the beginning of the film, until a highly skilled assassin (a capable, relentless Karl Urban) explodes into their lives, sends their jeep careening off a bridge, resulting in Marie's death. This pisses Jason off and then some, prompting a global excursion to find out who Urban works for and take them down. Also on his trail is CIA bigwig Pamela Landy (Joan Allen, excellent) and the severely morally misguided Ward Abbott (Brian Cox takes slimy to a whole new level in this outing). There's also scheming Russian oil magnate Gretkov (a relaxed Karel Roden) with his own reasons for wanting Bourne. As is always the case, Jason is the smartest guy in the room, more so even than those that trained him, and he out thinks, out shoots and outruns them all every step of the way that takes him nearer to his goal. He isn't simply running scared and confused with no outlet or idea how to use his talents anymore. He's a lethal asset with emotion and forethought on his side, and he takes no prisoners. Damon is just ridiculously badass, especially in the several furious hand to hand combat scenes he dances through, doling out the smackdown faster than anyone's reflexes can react. There's also a humanity to him, burgeoning regret when he learns what Treadstone made him do, and the yearning to set it right, or at least make himself known to the daughter (Oksana Akinshina) of a Russian couple he once murdered. People complain about all the shaky cam, but whatever man, it sure fires up an action sequence and places you right there amid the mayhem of a rattling jeep chase through a Berlin tunnel, a bone splintering man to man with an ex Treadstone operative (Marton Csokas) and more. Julia Stiles is terrifically intense as a girl who used to do the psych evaluations for agents, Chris Cooper briefly returns as Conklin, the devious founder of the program, and watch for Tomas Arana, Corey Johnson, Gabriel Mann and Michelle Monaghan too. Like I said it's a tricky task to pick a favourite, and on any given day I'd just say I love all three equally. This one just has a bit of an edge on the others in certain spots, and never feels like it bears the curse of the middle chapter. It's a tightly wound coil of a film that springs into kinetic motion with the force of a piston. I'm curious to see how the new Bourne flick does, but I doubt it'll come close to the first three, let alone this platinum classic.

Perhaps I will find it in ""Ultimatum""?I have definitely added Matt Damon to my list, he is so good at what he does and I really like his character in this series.
I love the fantastic action sequences and the conspiracies and twists, but the basic premise bears similarities to ""Rambo"" with its super soldier sent out to pasture type thing. The Bourne series is obviously far better, although I'm only on number two.I'm quite glad that Marie doesn't feature in it as much as the first as she irked me a bit in the first and I really like Dr McCoy as the Russian guy. Brian Cox is always brilliant, to the point where I'm not sure if I'd like him in real life, because he plays this character too well.

This involves a tortuous and complicated trail of hide and seek and destroy across Europe, from Naples to Berlin to Moscow. And imho it is complex – I was hoping to do something else as well as watch this, some hope! It looked bloody chilly in Moscow, how artists suffer. With concentration turned up there's plenty to savour: the marvellous brevity, endless bone-crunching fight scenes, non-cartoon car chases and explosions, the overall sense of realism. It was the realism and the way everything that happened seemed fresh and immediate that helped me through a convoluted plot unflinching to the sharp and well-judged ending. Nearly two hours went West so fast! I still prefer films to be unshaken and stirring, but it's worth putting up with this pretentious angle of the otherwise excellent camera-work for some decent entertainment.",The Bourne Supremacy
95,davidmvining,"A great thriller, through and through",10,6 October 2020,"I have loved this movie since the very first time I saw it, which was on a plane back when not every seat had a screen. I watched it about eight rows back on the small television sized screen ahead, and I was enthralled for every minute despite the far from ideal viewing experience. Since, I've seen it about a dozen times and I'm completely engaged from beginning to end. I think this is one of the great thrillers.Where this movie goes right so quickly is in the set up. There's a certain ingeniousness to how the filmmakers, Tony Gilroy and Paul Greengrass, get Jason Bourne to leave his life on the run to return to the world of spycraft and the CIA. It's a plot to frame Bourne for a crime he did not commit half a world away to give the CIA an endless ghost trail they'll never be able to get to the end of. He's a pawn in someone else's game, and he turns everything on that. That they also get his love interest murdered early helps his motivation, but it also helps to focus the movie on its core essential points without worrying about a female tag-along character (which Marie kind of was in the first film to the point that Bourne jettisons her for the final act).So, Bourne has taken his German girlfriend Marie on the run, and they've ended up in Goa, India. He's consumed by nightmares, but there's one in particular, about a job he did in Berlin, that's occupying him now. That this is also related to the main plot is just good, economic storytelling. The plot of the film involves the killing of a CIA agent during an op in Berlin by a Russian assassin to hide evidence of an old wire transfer that got rerouted and lost years before. They frame the murder of the CIA agent on Bourne using his fingerprint with the understanding that the files the agent was buying were tied to Conklin, the man who ran Treadstone in the previous film for whom Jason Bourne worked. The idea being that the CIA would imagine Bourne was covering for his dead boss to protect himself, which, of course, he didn't do. Hence, the ghost trail to nowhere.I've read reviews where all of above paragraph feels out of reach of the reviewer, and I got it the first time on that airplane. It's all said, doled out over the movie to those who pay attention.So, the assassin goes to India to kill Bourne, kills Marie instead, and Bourne gets away with the Russian thinking he's dead and the CIA looking for the Bourne who killed the CIA agent in Berlin. Where in The Bourne Identity, Jason felt at first behind the audience and then kind of drifting a bit, Jason feels direct and purposeful and oftentimes ahead of the audience in The Bourne Supremacy. He uses his tools, all of which feel really grounded in a tangible reality that fits in well with the grittier visual aesthetic that Paul Greengrass brings to his camera, to very quickly move from India to Berlin and find the people who are chasing them. It's simply a satisfying look at his skills.However, Jason is not simply a collection of skills. What makes him really compelling in this second film is the fact that he's driven by guilt. He has these fractured memories of murders that the man who came out of that amnesia never did, and yet he did them. The fact that he's disassociated from them doesn't change the fact that his hands did it. The Russian politician and his wife whom Bourne sees himself murder every night in his dreams are dead because of him, and that haunts him. This all becomes really important later.The movie contains two parallel plots, one is Bourne looking for answers to his questions and fractured memories, and the other is Pamela Landy, CIA task force chief, following the clues around Bourne. Landy is tasked with finding Bourne, but in order to do that the CIA Director pairs her with Ward Abbott, the man who was above Conklin in Treadstone in the previous film. The two clash, and for good reason, because Abbott ends up behind everything that Landy is looking for.Let me take a second to talk about Joan Allen as Pam Landy. Joan Allen plays Pam as ice cold, and it's great. She really feels like the kind of woman who could rise into this kind of role in the CIA. She takes no guff from anyone, and she pushes harder than she gets pushed. She has a steely gaze that fits so perfectly with the role, and she's one of my favorite parts of the movie.One of the most interesting things about the main plot of the film, about the CIA files and Bourne and Conklin, is that it ends with almost thirty minutes left in the movie. Bourne finds out Abbot, gets him to confess, and hands the tape to Landy, and yet the movie keeps going. Why?I've read of some criticism that the final act when Bourne moves from Berlin to Moscow is pointless because, well, the plot is over by that point. And yet, there's the second story about Bourne dealing with his guilt. The entire reason Bourne was following the trail of breadcrumbs that happened to coincide with Pam Landy's trail of breadcrumbs was because he was haunted by these images from Berlin, and he needed to figure them out. He needed some closure. Well, he was never going to find his closure in Berlin. The people he killed weren't German, they were Russian. So, he goes to Russia to atone, and that's where the first plot, even though it's actually over, reaches out and makes things exciting with a car chase (possibly the best car chase on film). It's related to both, but ultimately about Bourne's guilt and decision to walk away from the life he had been leaving in a wonderfully visual moment where Bourne goes into the light out of a tunnel after the chase instead of the dark of the other way forward.Now, I've danced around with the story enough, what about the action elements? I love them. Here's the thing about Paul Greengrass and his shaky-cam visuals: He's really good at them. There's a perception that it's all about just sort of capturing small bits of action and stitching them together, but as I watched The Bourne Supremacy this time, I watched with an eye towards those scenes. I think I've figured out how I can be so comfortable with them.The key is that while the bulk of these sequences are built out of very small visual pieces, these pieces are intercut with establishing shots that last at least a second and a half every three to five seconds. So, what Greengrass is doing is giving you a view of what's going on from a medium or long shot, and then closing in for a feeling of frantic action before pulling out again for a second and then pushing in again. It's a cycle that he follows and it allows for a shocking amount of clarity considering the reputation. Some might say that a second and a half simply isn't enough to ground oneself, but I can do it just fine. For all the close ups, I never have any problem with the geography of the scene, never losing sight of where one subject in the frame is relative to the other. It's a style that many simply don't like, but I find it effective at replicating the frantic style of thinking mixed with a clear-eyed view of the overall action.And, going back to the film's actual ending, where Bourne finally gets a chance to atone for his sins to someone he actually hurt: It's such a great little scene. It's quiet and painful. It's also a marvelous way to end the film, but the film continues on for another couple of minutes with a kind of cutesy final conversation between Landy and Bourne that I like as a coda, but I still kind of wish that they had left it in Russia.The Bourne Supremacy is a great film. It's a great action film. It's a great thriller. It is Paul Greengrass elevating the material and Tony Gilroy finding a way to deepen it. I love this film.",The Bourne Supremacy

I'm not a fan of action movies but I'm running out of stuff to rent.I really did not enjoy this movie. I found it so dull that I dozed off twice; once in the middle of the last action sequence! I guess I'm not the target audience for this. I do require that a movie put some ideas in play for me to get engaged. This movie had none. It just drags you between action setpieces with middling pursuit/intrigue dialog. As I watched I kept thinking, wasn't this scene in the first one? the second one?

97,rosscinema,Exciting sequel makes you crave for more in this well made franchise,7,7 September 2004,"I'm usually not one that looks forward to movie franchises but this sequel does a rare thing in that it makes the viewer hope that they keep the character active through more films. This is the second installment and it picks up where the first film left off with Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and his girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente) living in Goa, India but one day Jason notices a stranger in town and instantly suspects him of being an agent which leads to a chase where Marie dies after their car crashes off a bridge and lands in the river. Jason heads to Berlin and learns that he has been framed in the murder of another agent even though he was in India at the time.*****SPOILER ALERT*****A CIA agent named Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) heads the case but when she questions Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) who headed the project that trained Jason she gets lots of flack from him. Jason starts a cat and mouse game with the CIA and various local authorities and ultimately he goes to Moscow to find the agent that killed Marie but back at the CIA Pamela doesn't know that it's actually Ward who is framing him.This film is directed by Paul Greengrass who is slowly becoming recognized as one of the more talented directors to emerge in the last few years and ""Bloody Sunday"" opened a lot of eyes to him. There are many reasons why this film (And the first) works so well and first is the way Bourne can get out of seemingly impossible situations either with hand to hand combat or through incredible ingenuity. But for me the real reason that these films stand apart is the casting of Damon as Bourne. Damon doesn't really have any quick one liners like Bruce Willis in ""Die Hard"" but instead he's a brooder that is trying to remember whether he's responsible for the deaths of two people in a hotel room. There's a terrific car chase scene towards the end of the film that is one of the better ones in the last ten years or so and it helps punctuate the fact that this is a very well made and exciting film. My only complaint comes from the editing as I thought there were to many quick cuts where if you blinked you might miss three separate shots but Greengrass does do a good job keeping the flow of the film moving at a nice pace even with all the action and scenic locations. I do have one suggestion to keep this franchise fresh (As long as Robert Ludlum keeps writing them) and it's to have other well known directors all take a turn directing one film like what they've done with the ""Harry Potter"" series. Can you imagine directors like Ridley Scott, Michael Mann, and William Friedkin all having a turn with a Bourne story? This concept will give each film it's own distinction with the hope that they won't just become tiresome sequels. I hope Hollywood is listening!",The Bourne Supremacy
98,p-stepien,Not supreme,4,2 January 2011,"Jason Bourne has escaped the world of Treadwater to Goa, India, where he lives a peaceful and happy life with Marie. Still not fully aware of his past he is more or less reconciled with himself and set to live his days away from who he used to be. That is until the past comes back to haunt him in the guise of the mysterious Kirill (Karl Urban), who suddenly destroys Bourne new world and with it causes the death of Marie. Meanwhile someone has killed two CIA agents in Berlin and did his best to frame Bourne for the kill. Jason Bourne is not about to back down as he is back in Europe and with one hell of a vengeance...On many levels the change of director did not seem to suit the Bourne trilogy and albeit the last part was a markable improvement this is a below par action movie, which lands a lot of punches, but lacks enough power to remain in memory. The is epitomised by the chase sequences or fights, which are rather standard unmemorable experiences. The end crash sequence and one nifty fight with another former Treadwater assassin are the highlight of an otherwise slowly unfolding experience. Even though it is the shortest of the Trilogy it felt much longer than the supreme ""Bourne Identity"".A lot of this has to do with the script itself, which is severely poorer, than its predecessor and unable to fall from plot-hole into plot-hole and cruises unknowingly in the seas of ridiculous scriptwriting. Some of the flaws are forgivable, but essentially it does cause Bourne to look a little bit like a twit, while the C.I.A. are a bunch of morons without little to no observational powers. Add to that the script basically seems to retread what was already done in part one, so we have very similar fights and chases, where Bourne tries to hide from the Police, the C.I.A. and god knows who else.The key plot-hole that irked me in disgust concerned the general notion that Bourne is so well trained that he never makes a mistake (as is specifically stated by one of the C.I.A. Special Ops), but at the same time no-one in the whole department ever gave a second thought about Bourne leaving a fingerprint on the scene of a crime. Elementary, my dear Watson. From then on we get the general background of the movie, which is far-fetch and badly scripted. Even though the movie remains thoroughly enjoyable (mainly thanks to a good portrayal of the title character by Matt Damon) you just can not drop the notion that everyone in the story is acting way stupider, than what should be acceptable for super special spies...",The Bourne Supremacy

This movie is just as great as the first one and I can only hope that the third part, which will certainly come, will be even better. The Bourne Supremacy starts where the Bourne Identity ended. Jason Bourne is trying, with his new girlfriend, to start a new life in Goa, India. Every night he is bothered by the same nightmare, not knowing what it is all about. All he knows is that it has something to do with his first assignment and that it all happened in Berlin. Then everything starts all over again... They are being chased down and after a while his girlfriend gets killed, but Bourne knows to escape... He starts his journey to and through Europe, trying to find answers and peace.If you hated The Bourne Identity, you better don't watch The Bourne Supremacy. In fact it is just more of the same... Does that mean it is boring? No, not at all. There is a lot of action, nice car chases, a lot of suspense... exactly what you need when you want to have a nice evening with some friends. The director has created an exciting action thriller, who sure will please the viewers who are not looking for a philosophical and didactic movie. This is just plain fun. I give it something in between a 7,5 and an 8.",The Bourne Supremacy

Bourne, who promised retaliation should anyone from his former life attempt contact, is forced to once again take up his life as a trained assassin to survive.Was this movie confusing? Yes, well, not until I stopped the movie, read the info. I didn't get on the computer and went back on watching it. I think I should do that with confusing movies instead getting confused throughout the movie. So I had less trouble with this film.I liked this film better than the first. The plot gets more interesting, there are more suspenseful scenes, and better action, including a prolonged car chase sequence and one sweet, quiet moment in the film.Although I don't know how the character acts in the book, Matt Damon's acting was really well in this film, along with Joan Allen and Brian Cox. I also liked the hand held camera throughout the movie, giving it a suspenseful feel.Still, although not better than Casino Royale or any Mission Impossible film (well, maybe better than the first), this film is better than the first.

The first Bourne I liked better because there was much more substance in the story than in this one. I mean there were not as many intriguing elements as in the last and it was about all a predictable cat-and-mouse-thriller. Then the camera work was not so bad as written here but I hope the responsibilities will make it better next time. The picture could have been better and sometimes it was too fast paced with many images cut and mixed but without losing the point. The soundtrack and audio effects were brilliant made and well adapted to each scene; just cool. Matt Damon did as usual a very great job here. The car chases are a real adrenalin push and they are rare in this genre. What I liked too were the many setting places as Naples, India, Moscow, Berlin, Munich, Amsterdam or New York. If you like action thrillers this is for you. For all these reasons I give 6.75/10.",The Bourne Supremacy

105,sme_no_densetsu,Bourne Again: My favorite of the Bourne trilogy,8,10 September 2008,"""The Bourne Identity"" introduced the character of Jason Bourne and here we delve deeper into his world as he is framed for a botched CIA operation just as he begins seeking his girlfriend's killer.Matt Damon is back as Jason Bourne and here he delivers another solid performance. Also back is Brian Cox, whose role is thankfully more prominent this time around. New to the group of CIA pursuers is Joan Allen who turns in an assured performance.The story in this middle film of the trilogy is my favorite mainly because it jettisons any romantic interest early on with the death of Franka Potente's character. Thus, the film is more of a 'pure' action movie than its predecessor. Also, the storyline gives us further insight into the puzzle of Bourne's past, which is essentially completed in the third film.The direction by Paul Greengrass is good but I find that the rapid fire cutting is overdone. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that the film moves at a breathless pace, as if the action could scarcely be captured on film. As previously, the music complements the action nicely though it doesn't draw attention to itself.This is my favorite of the trilogy because it is simply the most action-packed. I haven't seen an action movie of this caliber for some time. Fans of the original and thriller fans in general will not be disappointed.",The Bourne Supremacy
106,Screen_Blitz,Jason Bourne returns for another action thrill ride,8,30 July 2016,"Matt Damon makes his return as the title character Jason Bourne, the CIA agent who was last seen in France on a mission to discover his past and evade the ruthless assassins that pursued him. This time however, Doug Liman who directed the previous film has reassigned to the executive producer with Paul Greengrass taking his place. More often than not, a change in directors during a film franchise tend to result in downward step in quality. Fortunately, Paul Greengrass appears to understand the heart and soul of the first film and manages keep it all alive in this sequel. Though it is hard to say whether this film improves upon the original or not as it does update in some areas but fall slightly short in others. Nonetheless, it makes a profoundly entertaining popcorn action flick. Matt Damon resumes his role as Jason Bourne who is now living in hiding in India with Marie (played by Franka Potente) after the events of the last film. Everything seems just fine between the two as they are living a happy, peaceful life together. That is until a mysterious CIA agent Kirill (played by Karl Urban) began following him around. Upon framing him for the murder of a former CIA agent, Kirill attempts to assassinate Bourne by the order of Bourne's former boss Ward Abbott (played by Brian Cox) and operation director Pamela Landy (played by Joan Allen) which goes horribly wrong. Soon, Bourne finds himself drawn back into the life he though he left behind and search for answers of what they want from him.This second installment delivers just about everything you'd expect from the following of the original. Like the first film, it's fast paced, delivers solid thrills, and shows lead actor Matt Damon in his spectacular, high-octane sense. From the first twenty minutes, we are introduced with a tense, frenetic car chase scene with Jason Bourne and Marie as they pursued by the devious Kirill who tries to kill our hero, and the scene ends in disastrous results that set the plot in motion. This entire sequence is nicely shot, as it is heart-racing and intense to sit through. The rest of the action revolves around martial arts combat between Bourne and the assassins that, though feature some slick choreography, suffer from ridiculous shaky camera work and quick cuts that try to illicit the intensity of the action but only make it difficult to decipher what's going on. It seems pointless to showcase such distracting camera work of the actors are demonstrating some decent fight choreography since nowadays filmmakers tend to use this gimmick to hide more sloppy choreography. Above all, the film's plot comes out on top, even more than in the previous film. With the lead character Jason Bourne more fleshed out, more knowledge of his past acquired, and a well conceived antagonist played by Karl Urban, the film shines on some improvement and makes for a story than viewers are more likely to become in engaged in, especially the ending which illicits Bourne in an emotionally powerful scene that largely defines his character. The Bourne Supremacy is a smart, crowd-pleasing action thriller sparked with terrific, if flawed action sequences, and a polished treatment of our action hero. Whether the film marks an improvement in the overall quality is difficult to say, but matters most is that it is highly entertaining and makes a must-watch for all action flick seekers.",The Bourne Supremacy
107,dunmore_ego,Bourne Again.,6,20 March 2009,"In THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, Matt Damon IS (still) Jason Bourne. The superspy from THE BOURNE IDENTITY (2002) is STILL on the lam, from the people who STILL want him dead - his ex-employers STILL at the CIA. Even though they've almost forgotten him at the opening of this movie, he lays low in India with his Euro chick, Marie (STILL Franka Potente).But other people STILL want him dead. Reason? It's a sequel - who needs a reason? Before we can say, ""contrived plot,"" suspicious Euros plant Bourne's fingerprints at a robbery location to frame him, and then send an assassin (Karl Urban) to track him down in India and cook his goose - at the very least, curry his chicken.Now maybe I'm being too logical here, but if these Euros have gone to all the trouble of hacking Bourne's fingerprints, planting them somewhere to frame him for a crime, then sending someone to assassinate him, wouldn't it seem more sensible to send an Indian operative who could sneak up on Bourne in India, rather than Karl Urban (who might as well be wearing his full Eomer costume from RETURN OF THE KING) who reeks Euro Bond Villain and sticks out from the local curry-mongers like Deepak Chopra at a Klan Rally? Needless to say, as Urban skulks around trying to blend his white face into the brown people, Bourne picks him immediately as an assassin, ""Hey, it's that guy from Middle Earth here in Eastern Earth,"" which precipitates the first of many creative, yet tiring, car chases.Why send someone to kill Bourne anyway? A tad redundant, considering the framing is supposed to entice the CIA back onto his tail - which it does. I guess the Euros are just being what American spy agencies cannot dream of being - efficient.While back at Inefficiency Central, the CIA bullpen is now overseen by Joan Allen (playing a battleaxe just a little too tough to be believable), doing the generic barking to peons at monitors, who have all devoted their lives, it would seem, to tracking Jason Bourne. And wondrously failing at their jobs. Brian Cox is her airy superior, who still can't figure why he's in this movie, after making that egregious ""alternate ending"" to the last BOURNE movie.The question must arise: Wouldn't the people who planted Bourne's fingerprints and the people who find Bourne's fingerprints both be familiar enough with Bourne to know that he is too smart to leave fingerprints in the first place? Um... it's a sequel. How much logic could we possibly need? Screenplayed by Tony Gilroy (who has a better grasp of author Robert Ludlum's character now, so doesn't need other writers to sully his one-trick pony) and directed by Paul Greengrass (mostly a TV director at this point, directing this like a TV movie), THE BOURNE SUPREMACY is like tripping down a flight of stairs, getting up and tripping again. All the action sequences are cut too hard and close for meaty satisfaction, from the hand-to-hand combat, to nystagma-inducing car chases, which lead to... more car chases. (The only thing the chase sequences do successfully is disguise some sensational drumming on the soundtrack.) There is a cool continuity in keeping the same Moby song as the movie's closer - or did they just forget they were making a sequel that just *seemed* like THE BOURNE IDENTITY? Still.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",The Bourne Supremacy

At times you will find yourself chuckling because of how Bourne plays his enemies.The film has some genuine scenes were the audience feels anger for what has been done to the character and at times sad; a great film which indicates Damon might be the new action hero of our time, like Stallone, Willis and Arnie were in the 80's and 90's.A great film which at time will leave you smiling.",The Bourne Supremacy

The action sequences are much more than just brilliant/excellent: especially the masterfully crafted car chase with shaky-camera style which makes it one of the best of its kind.

111,TheUnknown837-1,"almost as good as the first one, but with a better development of the character of Jason Bourne",7,1 December 2007,"""The Bourne Supremacy"" is in a lot of regards, very much like the first film ""The Bourne Identity"". It is continuing where the first film left off, where Jason Bourne asked a lot of questions, had some of them answered, and most of them unanswered and he is still pursuing those answers, but all the time, just wishing that this whole thing would just stop so that he could live out his life in peace. Now that he's lost his memory of his days as an assassin, he just wants to be able to blend into the crowd and be left alone. But his enemies, who he still isn't sure why they are hunting him, don't agree and will not allow him to have what he wants. Now Bourne has new enemies, more tasks, and more questions that he wants answered.The film does start off on a bit of a flawed level and kind of rushes right through, but once that's over, then it becomes just like the first one, with thrilling and clever action sequences, good acting, and an overall compelling storyline that keeps you glued to the seat until the end. Matt Damon is still the ultimate actor when it comes to playing a spy like Jason Bourne. When he is walking around quickly, making quick and snap judgment decisions that ultimately prove to be to his advantage, it almost seems like we are in the scene with him. The same repetitive music score in the background enhances the scenes as he struggles to escape with his life and still find the answers he's looking for.The screenplay for ""Supremacy"" was slightly better than the one for ""Identity"". Here, Bourne has become more intelligent and thus, has more clever lines to say. The same goes for the other characters who still retain and intelligent style. These people, both Bourne and his enemies, are professionals who never make mistakes or bad calls. They are trained to think quickly and be right the first time. So it's not an impression that Bourne's being hunted by a group inferior to him, which I find works out extremely well. The assassins he must dodge this time, and the organizations he must interrogate with, are twice as great as the ones he encountered in the first film, and overall gives the impression that Bourne's getting smarter, and as he gets smarter, so do his enemies.Like ""The Bourne Identity"" and the third installment, ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", the ""Bourne Supremacy"" is another one of the modern quintessential action movies that stands out above the others with its intelligence, cleverness, and lack of symbolism that just makes it a powerful and extremely fun action movie to keep us motivated and asking for more. The main reason for this is that it doesn't end with all questions asked during the running time being answered. It doesn't make it end on a confusing or incomplete level, but just enough to make us dying for the next installment, to see who and what Bourne will encounter next.",The Bourne Supremacy
112,PatrynXX,Doesn't disappoint. But laking the spirit of the first.,7,4 January 2005,"I guess it wasn't bad, but of course as with many spy movies Franka Potente has to be the one who dies.

It'll be tough to watch the first movie now. :( It also points out unknown questions that I guess weren't answered in the first movie. Now I haven't read the book so I really don't know it's accuracy... but this was a major setback.Overall, the movie isn't a total loss since it basically picks up the action where the last one left off.

113,film-critic,I remember good things all the time.,2,10 December 2004,"I must first say that I have not read this book, I am purely basing this review off the film that I just witnessed. When I watched the Bourne Identity, I was taken aback. While I didn't think that it was the best film out there, I did see potential and some very exciting location scenes. It was as if we were witnessing an American James Bond being Bourne (sorry, no more puns). This original film kept me on my seat and excited about the characters during the two hour run. Sadly, I cannot say the same for the sequel, The Bourne Supremacy. It seemed, and felt, as if this was a harder book to put into a film. Perhaps it was the direction, or even the screenplay, but there was way too much happening in the short 109 minutes that this film ran. From inconsistent flashbacks to a feeling that you had to memorize the first film to get this one, I felt the Bourne Supremacy was like a spilled bucket of nails  bits and pieces were all over the place, and it hurt to pick them all up at once.Damon seemed to do well revisiting his character of Jason Bourne, a bit more stable than in the original, his combination of two facial expressions helped push me through the rest of this film. Brian Cox is Brian Cox, his characters seem to always be very similar in nature. He looks gruff, but does he always need to act gruff? Joan Allen felt as if she had something up her rumpus throughout the entire film. Her character had no emotion, no expression, and no excitement, which eventually was pushed off onto me. She ruined this film. I could not stand watching her on screen, I felt that she had no chemistry with the rest of the cast and that she was involved only to collect the much needed paycheck. Did anyone else feel as if you were watching another version of X-Men? Wolverine can't remember his past and the Brian Cox connection? I guess I let my mind wander too much through this film or maybe I just wanted to re-watch that film instead, but there was this eerie resemblance that hovered over my mind.So, we have sub-par actors trying to build some intensity and ultimately failing? What else could go wrong? Well, how about the shambled mess of plots known as the ""story""? What was going on here. I felt as if I was being pulled in about a thousand different directions. I am a huge fan of the multi-layered stories, but only if they have some logical connection between them. There was no connection in this story. While director Greengrass attempted in every way possible to keep us in step with Bourne, you couldn't help but get lost. Literally, I felt as if I needed a road map when I rented this film. What does this tell you? Instead of the choppy, unsteady-cam flashback sequences, Greengrass should have spent a bit more time on some back-story or development. The drunken flashback moments just didn't work for me. I felt as if I could have understood this film a bit better by getting intoxicated myself, instead of allowing the director to do it for me. I was lost. It really felt as if they were grabbing at anything possible to connect this espionage thriller together. There was bad glue and I couldn't understand why nobody saw this.Actors being average (or below average) coupled with a broken, choppy story is no way to bring us a sequel. I guess if you wanted to build a better reputation on the original you would release a film like this. I should check the latest reports on how The Bourne Identity is doing in rental and sales to see if this is true. When you go into a sequel, you expect to see similar faces, bigger effects, and/or a deeper story. What instead occurred with The Bourne Supremacy were similar yet under-producing faces, no better effects (the car chase doesn't count since you can see that in nearly every other action/espionage film), and a story that ranks among the worst Hollywood has to offer. I am not sure how closely it is to Ludlum's story, but I have a feeling he may not be as happy with this endeavor. It was a brutal mutilation of his characters.Overall, I was not impressed. My wife didn't even make it through the film because it gave us both headaches. Damon can do Bourne well, but the material that he was handed to this film should have been reconsidered. Perhaps a new director would have worked to give a new image to the Bourne name and style. Either way, something needed to be done and it wasn't. This was a poor excuse for a sequel and a dark chapter in this seemingly exciting character's life. Skip it. I promise it will make you a better person.Grade: ** out of *****",The Bourne Supremacy
114,NijazBaBs,"good as 1st sequel, in bit different way",9,8 April 2019,"Reason why I rated this 9 stars is because overall it is good as The Bourne Identity. But while this time there was bit less adventure and more action. Meaning less talking and more running. I did not like that beginning and ending such as explanation of killing of his wife and explanation of him killing somebody's parents was too quick, without details and not convincing. Reactions were bland, inappropriate, and too short. We could not even see what really happened to dead bodies and other details. There were opportunity where it could be more interesting like when other character realized that he is watching her, but it ended up too quickly, not so interesting.

115,brchthethird,"A slightly lesser, but nevertheless eminently watchable sequel",8,14 November 2014,"In this sequel to the well-received BOURNE IDENTITY, two years have passed and Jason Bourne is still trying to piece together events from his past. However, his relatively peaceful, off-the-grid existence is disturbed when he is framed for murder and drawn out of hiding. THE BOURNE SUPREMACY takes what worked about the first film and builds upon it here. There's more of the great action sequences and intelligence agency intrigue, which actually forms the basis for this movie's plot. The curtain is also pulled back further on Bourne's past and a few more questions are answered. In general, this film stacks up with the previous one, at least on a narrative level. Still, the change in director from Doug Liman to Paul Greengrass is noticeable. Paul Greengrass has a distinct visual style that makes extensive use of hand-held/shaky camera-work, which has mixed results here. One instance of where it does work is early on in a tense, score-less hand-to-hand fight in an apartment. The camera-work there gives a sense of chaos and a feeling of disorientation that adds to the drama of the scene. One example where it doesn't quite work is a climactic car chase through the streets of Moscow. Here, there is a noticeable drop in comprehensibility, and the editing is rather hit-or-miss. As far as the cast is concerned, everyone gives a good performance as usual. In the last entry, I complained slightly about Julia Stiles' character, but here her performance is improved although her character isn't given too much screen time here either. Since the plot revolves around intelligence agency intrigue and eastern European geopolitics (to an extent), those roles are somewhat expanded. There is also a new character played by Joan Allen who serves as Deputy Director. Her presence adds another layer to the proceedings, and adds some additional complexity to story elements already established in the first film. At times it felt like her character was being mistreated simply because she was a woman, but those types of organizations do tend to be ""good ole boys clubs"" (or whatever the proper term is). The score this time around is mostly just as good, although there were some techno aspects to it that I didn't like as much. However, they did use the same Moby song during the closing credits that they used in the first one. Overall, I thought this was an excellent, if slightly lesser, sequel. Even though the directing reins changed hands, it felt like the overall continuity was kept. I definitely recommend seeing this, especially if you're a fan of the series.",The Bourne Supremacy
116,hnt_dnl,INFERIOR sequel to THE BOURNE IDENTITY...And that's a FACT!,4,19 October 2009,"What is this current obsession that sequels are automatically superior to the originals nowadays? If film history has shown us ONE thing, this is RARELY the case! When THE BOURNE SUPREMACY (2004) first came out, I kept reading and hearing how it surpassed its exciting, vivid predecessor THE BOURNE IDENTITY (2002). Frankly, it does not. The biggest complaint...SHAKY CAM! With all the constant hand-held camera-motion, the viewer can't discern any of the action or acting for that matter! Films now think they have to resort to gimmickry and overcomplicated storytelling to even be considered great.THE BOURNE IDENTITY kept the plot beautifully simple: likable amnesiac protagonist (brought to life by Matt Damon, here again playing Jason Bourne) found by Greek fisherman goes on a quest to find out who he is and what he does; and even though his story was convoluted, the filmmaker (Doug Liman) kept it to the basics: love interest, lean action sequences, pulse-pounding music, minimal number of key characters, totally satisfying ending! What does the director (Paul Greengrass) of this sequel do? What every sequel TRIES to do: 1) Up the ante by exponentially increasing the cast! In BI, we had one main ""villain"" brilliantly driving the action, Chris Cooper's cold, action-oriented determined CIA boss; in BS (perfect initials!), we are forced to watch a poorly cast Joan Allen as stagnant Pamela Landy, who just stands in a computer room barking at her superiors and inferiors and patsy Brian Cox (CIA Chief Abbott back from the original) with an expanded role here to just meat up the story and provide a fall guy.2) Overcomplicating the plot! Get all extra serious with Bourne recalling some random empty backstory where he killed this girl's parents. They explored this already in BI when Bourne recalled his aborted attempt on Wombosi's life because his children were in the room! And that ending between Bourne and the girl was just another manipulative ending. The guy's probably killed hundreds of people. Why does he HAVE to go to this one kid? Just because he remembers. It was his job! 3) This shaky cam nonsense! It is totally distracting and drained the film of any excitement, fun, suspense, AND entertainment value.4) No payoff! I wanted Bourne to kill that assassin (Karl Urban) who killed Marie (Franka Potente back in an early, quick cameo). He deserved it! I know why he didn't do it...Marie wouldn't have wanted him to...YAWN! I first saw this movie on a FULL airline flight and there was not one single OOH or AAH during the runtime and after it was over, NO ONE applauded. Shouldn't essentially an action movie have those moments of pleasure and excitement? I think mostly everyone fell asleep on it.

117,CitizenCaine,Bourne A Second Time,8,19 July 2005,"Matt Damon returns for a second time as Jason Bourne in the spy vs. spy action thriller The Bourne Supremacy. Bourne is a more conventional action hero in that he does not use all kinds of outlandish gadgets like a James Bond would. The story opens with an assassin hot on Bourne's trail. Soon Bourne is drawn back into a life on the run, as he is framed for a murder of a CIA operative. Bourne tries to find out why. Franka Potente is back as Marie briefly, the girl Bourne latched on to in the first film. In addition to Damon as Bourne, there are several good supporting roles well played: Joan Allen as CIA boss Pamela Landy, who is trying to bring Bourne in; Karl Urban as the assassin Kirill, who dogs Bourne throughout the film; Brian Cox as CIA boss Ward Abbott, who has revelations of his own that Bourne is interested in; and Julia Stiles, who plays sort of a junior agent that has a very good key scene with Damon as Bourne. The pace is pulse-pounding, and Damon as Bourne has great presence and always commands screen attention. The film contains one great action sequence after another. The stunt work is mind-blowing, especially during a protracted car chase where Bourne is in a cab. This is a welcome relief in an action film where CGI technology has become so common that it may one day receive acting credit. Director Paul Greengrass combines hand-held camera-work with lightning quick editing, which mirrors Bourne's dilemma of piecing together his memory as he adds bits and pieces of information to it along the way. This is a first rate action thriller with no obligatory romance thrown in for good measure for once. A third Bourne film is in the works. *** of 4 stars.",The Bourne Supremacy

This event, though only ten or twenty minutes in, turns the plot around and delivers a gritty and dark blow to the central character.From there we see Bourne trying to find out why the CIA is hunting him down. Bourne travels to Goa, Berlin, Moscow and America to find answers. Having the film set in different locations gives the narrative a delicious spin and an incentive to explore. The filming in these different locations is excellent, and there is a beautiful behind the scenes feature on the DVD which is definitely worth viewing.Paul Greengrass takes over to direct this crime thriller and delivers an action styled realistic impact on the narrative. The hand-held camera style can be off putting and the action sequences can feel too shaky for the scene's own good. However when following Bourne on foot and doing the slow tense scenes in the offices and cafes, Greengrass achieves a hard sentimental feeling.Filled with cars, boats and guns, this description may seem like a review for Bond. This second instalment to the series feels a lot like a 007 flick with its heavy use of action. Unlike Bond, the action sequences in these films are far more realistic and therefore easier for its viewers to digest and appreciate.Bourne is also a lot more open in this film but he still has that soft silence that was blissful viewing in the first film.Like Identity, Supremacy has a wonderful soundtrack, which plays softly in the background giving the film an intensely blissful vibe.This is the least accomplished of the series as the intensity doesn't live up to Identity or Ultimatum and the direction is frequently inconsistent. However it is still exciting with its complex and sombre narrative and wonderful central protagonist.",The Bourne Supremacy
119,jon.h.ochiai,Bourne Redemption,9,6 August 2004,"""The Bourne Supremacy"" is perhaps the best spy thriller in the past few years. Matt Damon as ""dormant"" CIA assassin, Jason Bourne, is the tormented hero forced back into the spy game when the stakes become personal. Director Paul Greengrass provides expert pace, intrigue, and intelligence to the movie. Although his visual style of quick cuts, particularly in action sequences is bewildering. More on that later. Matt Damon is a movie star. As Jason Bourne he brings tremendous intensity balanced with the disturbing calm of master assassin. Along with Greengrass, acknowledge the Tony Gilroy screenplay based on the novel by Robert Ludlum. ""Supremacy"" also has an excellent cast including the very strong and smart Joan Allen as Pamela Landy, CIA operations director, the subdued evil of Brian Cox as Ward Abbott (Landy's predecessor), and the solid Julia Stiles returning as Nicky, the voice of conscience. ""Supremacy"" has an edge-- it is uncompromising. Jason Bourne wants to find some measure of peace in self-imposed exile in a remote town in India with the love of his life, Marie (the beautiful Franka Potente). However, he is haunted by patch memories of past missions. He was a programmed killer, and some of his targets were not necessarily the ""bad guys"". Greengrass and Gilroy unravel the story where their hero takes responsibility for both his actions and the aftermath, and accepts that he will not be forgiven. The story is rather intricate, and my mind is rather simple. Consequently, this does not give anything away. Fortunately, the plotting is straight forward. So here goes. An assignment to recover CIA files under the watch of Landy (Allen) goes amok, and agents are murdered. This debacle is framed on Bourne, who is residing in the Indian town. To complete the conspiracy, a former KGB operative (the dark and charismatic Karl Urban) is sent to kill Bourne (Damon). He fails; however, it results in a personal tragedy for Bourne. Thus, Bourne is forced back into the game seeking retribution. This is a welcome twist from ""The Bourne Identity"": Jason Bourne is now choosing his targets. He tells Landy, ""I will bring this war to your doorstep..."" Much of the satisfaction in watching ""Supremacy"" is that his adversaries underestimate Bourne's prowess, and think they are ""badder"" than he is. They are educated accordingly. In this way Joan Allen is effective as Pam Landy, who grows to respect Jason Bourne as the best. Period. Acknowledge Matt Damon. His Bourne is a tortured, explosive, smart, and totally empathetic hero. Damon has a powerful and quiet presence. He got in great shape and conditioning to play the role. His martial arts fighting sequences are excellent... when you can see them. This is one of things that could have been better in the movie. Greengrass's quick cut, music video style editing does not do justice to the fight scenes. The choreography looks sharp, but one can't really tell. This is really a personal bias. As a martial artist, I was interested in seeing the details of the cool knife fight sequence. Regardless, one can tell that Damon trained very hard for the fight sequences. Greengrass's style did however, make the final car chase scene the most captivating in recent movie memory. It is amazing. ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is an intense, uncompromising spy thriller with strong performances. Matt Damon is awesome as Jason Bourne.",The Bourne Supremacy

121,ivo-cobra8,"The best sequel in my opinion, my number 1 favorite Bourne flick ever!",10,9 December 2016,"This is the best sequel in The Bourne Trilogy in my honest opinion. I love the sequel much more than the original movie. The Bourne Supremacy is my number 1 favorite Jason Bourne film, while the second one is The Bourne Identity. It was always movie that I wanted to see the first time I heard about it. It is the second Bourne movie based on the second novel by Robert Ludlum. I love this movie to death it is a brilliant, absolutely brilliant spy action flick! I love this movie because it is fast paced, it is short mostly it is a logical movie that I quickly learn to get the plot about the movie. Trough entire movie Jason Bourne is framed on a run he is alone, tired, with a dead girlfriend and he hasn't seen diddly-squat from anybody down here. That an action hero suppose to be alone single shot down the bad guys that's what Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) did in this movie. I love the lead charterer in this movie, the action, the espionage, Matt shows feelings in this movie. Joan Allen was fantastic as Pamela Landy she was incredible awesome! I love the actress in this movie I love her to death!! Matt Damon once again does a powerful job performing his character and he is brilliant with excellent skills. He has a talent playing Jason Bourne. He's acting ability are very unique and incredible at the screen. Plot: When Jason Bourne is framed for a CIA operation gone awry, he is forced to resume his former life as a trained assassin to survive. Matt Damon returns as the covert operative known as Jason Bourne, who comes out of hiding to expose who is responsible for a series of assassinations that were done in his name. The plot is simple: Kirill (Karl Urban) a Russian Secret Service assassin who works for Russians, kills in Berlin two CIA agents and frames Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) by planting his fingerprints. In India he try's to kill Bourne but he misses and he kills Marie (Franka Potente) Bourne's Love, but misses him. Now Bourne does what he does best, avenge his girlfriend and clearing his name. First he thinks it is Treadstone all over again and that Deputy Director Pamela Landy is the leader of that program but when he find's out that Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) and the Russians set him up and they are responsible for killing his girlfriend, he goes after them in Russia and he eludes the cops and the CIA operatives. He remembers flashbacks when he killed a young Couple Neski when he was an agent. What I love about this movie: Jason Bourne blows all wide open the Russians, he foils their plans, he foils Abbot's plans with the Russians. He kills in self defense the last member of the Treadstone program, he kills Kirill (Karl Urban) the murderer who killed Marie and he avenges his girlfriend. He confesses he's crimes to Irena Neski(Oksana Akinshina) what he did and he didn't except forgiveness. He is a bad-ass in this movie!I love the actor Karl Urban the actor always appears in a movies that I like: Dredd, Doom and Red. I love the actor I really love him he did a good job. I like the actress Oksana Akinshina as Irena Neski and I love the actress Julia Styles as Nicky Parsons she helps hunting Bourne again but, this time she helps Pamela Landy, I know she has a small role in here, but she is still decent.I love Brian Cox as Ward Abbott he was a good villain in this movie gosh I love this flick to death. Paul Greengrass did a good job directing the sequel that I love to death. This is the movie I have always loved since the first time I saw. I love it. Jason Bourne is the best action hero to come out of the movie/book world and he is a decent likable character. Supremacy is the second in the series, and it definitely meets/tops the first. Jason is still kick-butt awesome, even after two years undercover. Unfortunately, the CIA is on his case again, even after he sort of asked nicely for them to leave him alone (oh, who am I kidding? He beat up the guy and threatened the entire agency). Without giving too much away, let's just say that, in typical Bourne fashion, a can of kick-butt is opened on the bad guys. My favorite bits are the sequence where a consulate guy tries to get answers out of Bourne, the part at the Alexanderplatz with Nicky and Bourne that they faces each other in person for the first time, and the car chase ('cause it's not a Bourne movie without him wrecking as many cars as possible!).Watch this one a few times, and you'll likely be quite moved each time. I'll be surprised if you give it less than what I gave it: 10/10 outstanding score and an awesome movie that I love to death.The Bourne Supremacy is a 2004 American-German thriller film starring Robert Ludlum's Jason Bourne character. Though it takes the name of the second Bourne novel, its plot is entirely different. The film was directed by Paul Greengrass from a screenplay by Tony Gilroy.

122,fernandoschiavi,"This new episode advances in the construction of the character Bourne with more adrenaline, reason and intelligence, taking the direction of this first trilogy to a safe path",8,1 August 2020,"Continuing the new franchise produced by Universal, the sequel to the surprising first film based on the character Jason Bourne arrives in theaters. Again based on the book of the same name by Robert Ludlum, this time, Doug Liman (now only producer) leaves and Paul Greengrass (Bloody Sunday) enters. Contrary to the positive outcome of The Bourne Identity, a previous film in the franchise, the first episode directed by Paul Greengrass begins a very different narrative from Doug Liman, both in the most pessimistic mood and in the way of driving the camera, with close-ups and recordings at angles closed, moved by a trembling hand emulating the pseudo-reality seen in documentaries.2 years ago Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) thought he had left his past behind as a cold and calculating killer created by Treadstone. Since then he has maintained an anonymous existence, giving up the stability of having a home and moving in with Marie (Franka Potente) whenever the threat of being discovered arises. When an agent appears in the village where Jason and Marie live, they have no alternative but to flee. However, a new international chase game requires Jason to confront old enemies.Bourne Supremacy has a structure very similar to its predecessor, but here, the action gains much more prominence, walking in parallel with the plot of conspiracy, betrayals and mystery behind the events. This second part already begins in the middle of the crossfire, two years after the events of the first film, with a CIA mission led by Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) being sabotaged by Kirill, a Russian agent played by Karl Urban. The clues planted by Kirill, however, lead Landy to believe that Bourne was responsible. Cut to Goa, India, and we see Bourne waking up from a nightmare made up of fragments of memories that refuse to surface completely. Tormented, he gets up to be immediately comforted by Marie (Franka Potente), still at his side. His apparent rest from the eternal escape initiated in the first film is about to end, however, as Kirill arrives to eliminate Bourne. Their reasons are unclear, but the result of the clash is the murder of Marie, in a touching scene that echoes Bourne's early demeanor, floating in the water. With his mind running at full speed, the super-spy leaves without hesitation to take revenge on his former commanders, whom he considers responsible.Damon is even more at ease like Bourne. He has an air of credibility that few action heroes have. He is no longer the complete member of the previous film, but remains haunted by a past that, if on one side he does not completely remember, on the other he does not want to remember. The conflict is visible on the actor's face, even when he turns entirely into an efficient killing machine. Despite a short time on screen with Marie (Franka Potente) in this sequence, we managed to care for the couple. Even with little screen time, Potente manages to show that his character is with Jason by choice, participating in this dangerous mess that is her boyfriend's life precisely because she loves him. This is an extremely powerful notion passed through the film. Jason, despite his condition, sees Marie as the only good thing in his life and the chemistry between Damon and Potente reinforces this. Brian Cox also repeats his role as Ward Abbott, gaining more relevance in the plot. Despite being ""a patriot"", he knows that he made mistakes, but, unlike Jason, he does not seek redemption, but throws the dirt under the biggest rug he can find. Joan Allen's character serves as the exact counterpoint to Cox's character, aiming to expose all the agency's corruption, which creates great moments between her character and Abbott. She manages to be an excellent counterpart to Damon because his Pamela Landy shows professionalism and calm in the same measure as Jason Bourne. And although the two never share screen time, the rapport between them is sensational.
The first episode, although interesting, kept in its formula many similarities with other productions of the genre. It is the type of work that improves over time, as the characters and their conflicts develop with the viewer. Everything works well, with logic, humor and depth. But one truth is unquestionable: Bourne Supremacy is even better than the previous one, and a lot due to the direction of Paul Greengrass. Although the story is a little less contagious, the director compensates with his excellent handling of the camera and efficient cuts that, even in the fight scenes, manages to enhance the choreography and performances. The chase sequences in India, which culminate in the death of an important character, are literally breathtaking. The scenes in Berlin masterfully show the more cerebral side of the plot in a game of hunting and hunter of rare intelligence. Finally, we still have a climax in Moscow, in tense and action-packed scenes. The scene of the chase aboard a taxi through the streets that culminate in a city tunnel is among the best of its kind that year.This continuation follows the proposal of its predecessor to maintain its action scenes in the 'real world': here, no fight was fought with the aid of wire wires or' turbinated' through computers. When Bourne leaves for the fight, the blows sound real and painful - and the stupendous car chase that occurs in the third act of the plot succeeds in the paradox of being perfectly credible at the same time that it makes us think: 'Incredible! '. The film is just not interesting anymore because director Paul Greengrass tried to create an atmosphere of super-realism for him, showing the camera always shaky, especially in the action scenes and in the main car chase scene (the film could not fail to have one, as in the original). The intention was good, but it is a fact that he exaggerated reasonably, since in some moments it is practically impossible to understand what is happening on the screen.The script, signed by Tony Gilroy, is accurate and does not waste time on unnecessary explanations, even when new characters are introduced. The viewer, for the first half hour, and very much in line with what the characters are experiencing, does not know exactly what is happening until Bourne on one side and Landy on the other start, independently, to assemble the complex puzzle. If in the other adventure, Bourne wanted to find out who he really was while trying to avoid being murdered by the old bosses, now the scene is different - hunting, he became a hunter! Intentionally framed as the perpetrator of an attack in Berlin, Bourne must return to action when his refuge in India is no longer safe. Only the prologue makes it clear that this is not a conventional script and that preconceived structures have been thrown overboard to give rise to a creative and innovative plot. Without further restraints, the protagonist turns into a lion and goes to fight to find out why he is still being chased and who is behind his head this time. Simultaneously chased by the CIA and Russian thugs, Jason Bourne never finds a second of peace, wherever he is - and when I say 'wherever he is', you can believe it: following the best tradition of productions starring 007.Bourne Supremacy includes scenes shot in no less than five countries: India, Holland, Italy, Germany and Russia, adding an additional attraction to the spy's adventures. The best part is that the filmmakers avoided tourist landmarks and urban clichés and show little-known details of these cities. This is most evident in the last two, thanks to the incredible scenes that take place on the Berlin subway and, above all, the magnificent car chase on the streets of Moscow, involving an injured Jason Bourne, Kirill and the local police. We feel, thanks to Paul Greengrass' superb camera work, in the action and not as mere spectators. And that owes much to the editing work of Richard Pearson and Christopher Rouse, Oliver Wood's photography and John Powell's score. As they were present in the first film in the franchise, both knew how to continue what they did previously, allowing the viewer to start the film by seeing and listening to a universe they were already familiar with.This sequence is a rare example of a blockbuster with a brain. Its political plot is relevant and connected with the current international political scenario, the interpretations are intense. This new episode advances in the construction of the character Bourne, adding details in his personality and giving greater verisimilitude to his figure with more adrenaline, reason and intelligence, taking the direction of this first trilogy to a safe path and which has everything to reach its peak in the third Jason Bourne's adventure in theaters.",The Bourne Supremacy
123,gregsrants,A smart action packed thriller,8,25 July 2004,"Can you guess what movie topped the charts as the most rented film of 2003? In the year that brought us such blockbusters as two Matrix sequels, an X-Men and Terminator entry and even a Big Fat Greek Wedding, you may not hit the jackpot if given 10 guesses and a handful of hints. That is because the $121 million domestic grossing Bourne Identity is the answer to the query, and with movies now being able to double and triple their theatrical runs on the small screen, it is no surprise that this week sees Jason Bourne back for another adventure in the Bourne Supremacy. For those of you that require a refresher course before sitting down to new sequential installments, Bourne (Matt Damon) was fished out of the water in the Bourne Identity and struggled through the film to regain his memory whilst dodging deadly assassins through Europe. Bourne would later find out that he was once part of the CIA, but he leaves that world behind and runs to a India with new female companion Marie (Franka Ponete) stating that '..if I even feel somebody behind me, there is no measure to how fast I will bring this fight to your doorstep.' Well, this is the entertainment business and a statement like that can only mean one thing.non-compliance. The Bourne Supremacy picks up with Jason's new life being threatened when he is framed for a murder of two individuals of a CIA covert action 4,000 miles away. The perpetrators of the crime want to kill him to cover their tracks, the CIA wants to kill him because they are convinced he is a loose cannon and Bourne dodges both parties from city to city putting the pieces together to help clear his name and ultimately reveal who the is the wizard behind the curtain. Since it is too easy to compare a sequel to its predecessor, I will follow the rule to a tee and reveal that the second Bourne is better than first. Hats off to new director Paul Greengrass who's only resume green flag was the 2002 documentary Bloody Sunday which chronicled the Irish civil rights protest of 1972. A curious choice then indeed, but now in hindsight, probably the best man for the job. Supremacy flings us through country and city after city with such ferocity that I felt I was reading the bottom left hand side of the screen every five minutes to have revealed the next extravagant location. A director with a flare for documentary film-making knows about pacing and with India, Virginia, Berlin, Munich and Moscow all being thrown at us before we get to the rim of our popcorn bags, the pacing in the hands of simplistic action director may have sunk the film. But even as I give kudos to the man behind the camera it is the action star with the franchise strapped firmly on his back that I have to give the most credit. Matt Damon (Bourne) has left his fellow childhood friend Ben Affleck in his dust with his choice of roles and acting ability and with the Bourne films he is able to pull off a superagent persona that doesn't seem to realize his ability until forced into action. A scene at a Naples airport where Bourne is detained and sits quietly waiting to erupt is a classic example of what we have come to expect from the once covert assassin. He sits without emotion or expression only to in an instant, overpower two guards and download information from a hand-held computer device in what shoots across the screen in about 7 seconds. Also back for a second time are Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) as the CIA director that has more secrets than helpful ideas for the cause, and Nicky (Julia Stiles) a CIA agent profiler that might have a few keys to the locks in Bourne's brain he is so desperately trying to access. Luckily these two characters have significant, but small parts as both actors provided weak performances in an otherwise strong cast. Cox looked tired and delivered his lines like he had a bus to catch which is probably truce since he has participated in no less than 5 movies this year alone (look out Stiller), and Stiles breaking down and crying when confronted with the inquisitive Bourne was hard to believe as a character that responsible the analysis of the mental well-being of other agents. As for action sequences, Supremacy delivers two fold over the original. It's climactic chase scene was incredible in its choreography and you will undoubtedly shake your head wondering at what point did they extract the star and replace him with the stunt actor. Damon looks to be the director's human piñata and the authenticity of seeing broken glass fly into his face as his car skids, smashes and ultimately becomes undriveable makes this one of the best car chase scenes since Ronin. The Bourne Supremacy is more complex than the first and the addition of the Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) character and the complex way to which she is between two agendas trying to find the truth while Bourne both somewhat trusts and uses her to find the truth, is a refreshing way to have a story unfold in a summer of huge explosions and pointless humor. I understand that there are three books in the Robert Ludlum trilogy of Mr. Bourne's adventures and it has been a while since I have looked forward to the hopes of a sequel so quickly after exiting the theatre of the last. But that is exactly what these films have done. We actually care about the hero of the film and we want him to find out more about his past as it sits like a piece of popcorn stuck in our teeth that we want to expose. I look forward to installment three and have already cleared a spot for the DVD box set beside the Indiana Jones and Jack Ryan series on my wall unit. Thumbs way up.",The Bourne Supremacy

As you walked out of the theatre you had a complete story. The same thing can be said of Supremacy which is a rare thing in movie franchises , especially with the middle installment of a trilogy.The pace is frenetic throughout the movie and the handheld cameras make it feel very edgy. Matt Damon gives a fine performance as Jason Bourne who seems to be at the top of everybodys hitlist even though he's just trying to lead an anonymous life.

126,TheNorthernMonkee,"decent sequel, but far from perfect",6,28 January 2005,"SPOILERS Some actors are forever branded with popular roles. If a man plays James Bond or something similar, people look at them and see the character. In the future, the same will probably be true of Matt Damon. Staring once again in 2004 as Jason Bourne, Damon put in a great performance, delivering an often intense and always unnerving piece of acting. Sadly however, the film itself suffered from certain key flaws, not least some errors in judgement from director Paul Greengrass.Jason Bourne is happy and living in India. Spending his time with love Marie (Franka Potente), he keeps an ever vigil eye on surroundings as he continues to evade the authorities. When an incident in Germany results in two deaths however, Bourne is seen as the culprit and once more he is forced to fight back against the Government who created him.""The Bourne Identity"" was a wonderful film. Whilst apparently different to the books, it contained enough intrigue and plot to keep the audience focused throughout. Therefore there was understandably a lot of expectation riding on this second feature. Sadly though, whilst the first film featured a decent performance by Doug Liman behind the camera, in this sequel he was replaced by the relatively inexperienced Greengrass. Greengrass, directing one of his first major films, to a degree follows the approaches of the original film. For vast quantities of time, the films are practically inseparable. Sadly though, anytime there is a moment of high speed action, Greengrass's direction ruins it. The reasoning behind this is that admirably the director chose to abandon special effects in favour of a gritty, hand-held camera style. This is an admirable idea, but it means that for segments, most notably the car chase towards the end, the camera shakes from side to side and gives the audience a feeling of nausea.Truthfully, Greengrass's direction very nearly destroys any standards that the first film set. This sequel is saved however by Tony Gilroy's adapted plot (although supposedly nothing like the books) and a fine performance by Damon.One key aspect springs out in this film which shows just how clever Matt Damon can be as Bourne. About three quarters of the way through the film, Bourne is once again on the run, when he is forced to make an awkward jump. From his landing, it is clear that Bourne injures his leg, and whilst in so many films, most notably the James Bond series, this injury might be forgotten, for the remainder of this story, Bourne limps. This shows a key devotion to attention and detail since the injury is to all degrees, irrelevant. If Bourne was simply able to walk again, nothing would be different in the story, he would simply walk normally. For Damon though to continue to limp, it shines through as a mark of clever acting.There are definite flaws in this second section of the Bourne stories. With awkward, albeit well meaning, direction by Paul Greengrass, the film suffers from some truly stomach churning camera operation. Despite this though, the story remains enthralling throughout, with Matt Damon doing a particularly impressive job as Bourne. Not quite as good as it's predecessor, but a worthy addition to Matt Damon's CV.",The Bourne Supremacy
127,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Terrific action thriller,9,9 August 2006,"Jason Bourne has escaped his past and moved far away from the events a couple years ago. His has nightmares where he recalls certain broken fragments of his violent past and he tries to piece it together at times, but it is all a blur. Then his past catches up to him as a mysterious assassin leaves Jason Bourne's calling card at the sight of a botched CIA operation, which resulted in agent deaths. Jason finds himself again marked for death and on the run out to find the truth.This sequel has everything the first one had - good performances, tight direction, great action scenes - and it also manages to capture Ludlum's intricately described intensity with its frenetic visual style. This is a great visual move that does a terrific job at evoking that rough and gritty mood of the novel. Action scenes are rather simplistic overall - fights and chases - but the visuals make them very intense. This especially goes for the pulse pounding adrenaline rush of a car chase at the end of the movie - if you think about it is just fast driving, swerving, and crashing. No big stunts, no insane pile-up, but the visuals take you right into the middle of the action and as a result you are treated to a convincing spy thriller and that is exactly what Ludlum initially wrote.Screenwriter Tony Gilroy has, once again, taken huge liberties with the novel, but the novel's story is obsolete in today's world as it was about a conspiracy in Hong Kong before the handover to China. The film's story has similar pivot points - mainly the use of Bourne's identity by a mysterious assassin to cover up a hit, which also opens the book - but the territory visited after that is much different. And that is actually pretty good since even if you have read the book you can still enjoy and equally intense (though still less intricate plot-wise) experience on screen. 9/10Rated PG-13: violence and intense action",The Bourne Supremacy

And although the excitement is thriller gold, it is when Damon becomes shows the vulnerable and genuinely touching of his already-exposed agent that the movie truly catches fire (as in the first), Damon knows how to balance his rock-hard-action-hero with emotionally powerful acting in a brilliant way; and though it may be a risky way of making an action movie, Damon knows how to underplay his character through which he totally eschews movie star vanity.

After the events of the first film Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and his girlfriend Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente) are living in India. When a CIA mission goes wrong they frame Jason for it. When an agent is sent out to kill Jason he kills Marie instead and the car they were driving goes off the bridge. Jason is assumed dead. But he survives and goes to Naples, Italy. Meanwhile CIA Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) is convinced that Jason and the late CIA supervisor Alexander Conklin were somehow involved in in a plot to steal $20,000,000 from Politician Vladimir Neski 7 years ago. Landy and Deputy director Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) go to Berlin, Germany to capture Jason. Jason is captured but escapes and goes to Munich, Germany after learning that the Treastone project in the first film was shut down after Conklin died, Jason goes to Berlin where Landy and Abbott meet up with technician Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) and question her about her past experiences with Jason. While this is going on Jason is watching Landy in her office and calls her. He tells her to send Nicky to him. He learns from Nicky that Abbott was the head of Treadstone instead of Conklin. He also now knows that he was the one who killed Neski and his wife 7 years ago and made it look like a murder/suicide. When Jason meets up with Abbott he confesses to ordering the assassination on Jason. Later when Landy confronts Abbott he commits suicide. Some time later in New York after Landy learns Jason's innocence, she is called by him. She tells him his real name is David Webb and that he was born on 4-15-71. Jason tells her that she looks tired and indicates that he can see her. Overall although this wasn't as good as Identity it was still a really good movie. I say this is one to see.",The Bourne Supremacy
132,jdkraus,It makes me dizzy nd makes me sad/disappointed!,6,28 July 2004,"This movie is totally out of control. the film editing, and the cameraman knows how to give the crowd a headache! The camera made the film so blurry. i could not find a spot in the film when the camera does not move. especially the fighting sequences! i was also disappointed about the film, of what happened to his girlfriend, what he did in his haunting past, and the film seemed to drag. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ! IT was not a terrible film though. It is a descent action film, has a few surprising twists, better acton scenes, and better new characters, like Pam. nothing is what it seems in this film. i did like the very ending and that Damon has once again improved his usage as Bourne. Overall rating 7 out of 10. It is an o.k. film, but not as good as the prequel!",The Bourne Supremacy
133,bopdog,"Not nearly as good as the original. ""OK"" overall, but also a bit disappointing and unsatisfying",10,13 August 2004,"WARNING --- SPOILERS!!! I really loved the first movie in what now seems to be a series. I always like Matt Damon, and I also like the German actress, Franke Potente, and feel we have been seeing far too little of her in Hollywood movies, or at least movies available to us in the English language movie world.""The Bourne Supremacy"" was advertised with the characters played by Matt Damon and Franke Potente diving back into some wacky spy world, danger, thrills, etc. But that was misleading. She gets killed off in the first set piece! I didn't time her screen time in minutes, but it couldn't have been more than 9 or 10 before she dies! She is shot dead in the opening scenes, and the bulk of the movie is without her. Fortunately, at least Julia Stiles' character survives long enough to play a part in the story--- but even that is not really satisfying--- after some dramatic and meaningful action between her character and Damon's, she kind of disappears and is never referred to again-- what actually happens to her? But that's just one of many unanswered questions raised in this rather vague sequel.Overall, the movie is entertaining, I guess, although more than once I found myself confused by seemingly arbitrary and unexplained developments in the storyline. I was disappointed, and a bit dissatisfied by the whole experience.",The Bourne Supremacy
134,Darkside-Reviewer,A worthy sequel!,6,16 June 2020,I really enjoyed The Bourne Identity so I was really looking forward to seeing what the next chapter in the Bourne series had in store with Supremacy the movie is a direct sequel to the first movie and it features a lot of the same characters from the first movie with all the original actors returning to reprise their roles aswell so as sequels go this movie definitely matched the unique style of the original movie from it's interesting and thought provoking storyline to the fast paced action scene's this a worthy sequel to an amazing first movie.The Bourne Supremacy takes place two years after the events of the first movie with Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and his partner Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente) who are now living in India under false identitys but when one day Jason notices someone looking for them their cover is blown and now Jason must find out why after all this time he's become a target again and who sent the assassin after him and why?.I really enjoyed the continuation of the story and this movie more than added to the storyline giving Bournes character more backstory giving us a glimpse into his past and the person he was before he lost his memory.The action scenes are top quality and we do get a lot more of them than in the first movie there's also a lot of scenes of Bourne playing cat and mouse with his pursuers which is always fun to see Bourne outwit them with him always being one step ahead of them at all times even when it looks like he's made a mistake it's all a clever ploy.A must watch movie for fans of the first movie.,The Bourne Supremacy
135,skepticskeptical,A Cautionary Tale,8,26 September 2015,"I have now watched this film three times. It portrays a frightening world in which operatives are brainwashed by the CIA—using drugs and other means—to become ruthless and unstoppable killers. The story of Jason Bourne is disturbing because he seems like a basically good guy who got sucked into this line of work by a misguided desire to serve his country. Why anyone would think that following orders to assassinate people ""no questions asked"" is an act of patriotism is beyond me. The potential for abuse in such programs by the people who run them—this one is called ""Treadstone""—is undeniable. Give human beings the power to kill with impunity, and you can be sure that some of them will succumb to the temptation to use the operators for their own selfish (usually greedy) purposes.The killers are stained for life by what they do, and everyone they come in contact with may be endangered as well, as happens here, when the operative sent to kill Bourne ends up killing his girlfriend instead. This is a very well-made and fast-paced action film offering some thought-provoking insight into the caustic incompetence agency as well. There is no place for these sorts of activities in a genuine democracy. Black ops are a sign of decadence and paranoia. Too bad they are being carried out in hundreds of countries today by people protected by cover of State Secrets Privilege.A final note: Pamela Landy makes a good contrast to other recent depictions of female CIA agents, such as Carrie Mathison in Homeland and the female lead of Zero Dark Thirty. Which depiction is most realistic? Unclear...",The Bourne Supremacy
136,sashank_kini-1,Good Entertainment With Competent Performances but a Slightly Disappointing Storyline and Frenetic (Sometimes Lunatic) Camera Work,7,12 August 2012,"When I visit a movie store, my eyes fall first on Oscar-winning drama films, then under-appreciated World movies, funny flicks, Meryl Streep films. and lastly on action and espionage movies, political and courtroom dramas. This generally happens because (i) generic action films have nothing but macho men blowing stuff up and cops chasing them and (ii) I find it tiresome to focus on plots that have external factual details such as following some case proceedings or listening to characters talking about covert mission plans. My hands would pick Singin in The Rain instead of And Justice for All, or Revolutionary Road instead of Die Hard, though I love a great narrative loaded with action and imaginative sequences such as Kill Bill. I've also watched Angelina Jolie's Salt quite a few times, even though it's plot was paper thin; the reason for that may be the sexy butt-kicking Jolie and pure fist-pumping action. So it wasn't me who bought the Bourne trilogy but my father, though he hasn't watched a single part. I liked Bourne One because it had a good balance between plot and action plus a romantic angle that's oh-so-common in such films. I unwrapped Bourne Supremacy almost five years since I purchased the CDs (Bourne Ultimatum is still packed in plastic) knowing I'll get a decent product because of talented Matt Damon's presence. Plus I wanted to see the previous movies before watching Bourne Legacy that's just arrived in theaters. And the second installment did provide me good entertainment with competent performances but I was slightly disappointing by the storyline and the frenetic fast cuts that robbed the 'edge of the seat' moments.Matt Damon reprised the role of Jason Bourne in 2004 in Bourne Supremacy along with Franka Potente who played Marie, his love interest from Bourne Identity. Bourne and Marie settle in Goa, India, miles away from his troubles, spending their days in Goan markets and beaches. Bourne has unanswered questions that he keeps recording in his diary. Troubles do find a way to him when an operation led by CIA Deputy Director Pamela Landy to buy evidence exposing a mole within the agency goes awry and Bourne's fingerprints are planted by Russian agent Kirill, thus implicating Bourne of murders and theft of $20 million. Kirill is then sent by Russian oil oligarch Gretkov to Goa to kill Bourne, thus ending the case there and then. Bourne escapes but loses his fiancé, and vows to find out what's going on and get his vengeance.The writing is similar to any conventional thriller, where the traitor is an unexpected figure (although we do figure it out way before the person comes out), the situations are predictable and the dialogs are typical of most spy films. The characters seem to be doing everything right but they don't do enough. Bourne is a brand so we'll keep talking about him but who's going to speak about how Machiavellian the traitor was (not mentioning the name) or how bad-ass Kirill was. Gretkov receives shoddy treatment as he doesn't have much role in towards the end. And there could have been more telephonic interactions/negotiations between Bourne and Pamela Landy (remember Hannibal Lector and Clarice Starling's spine-chilling interactions in Silence of the Lambs). It seems Bourne Supremacy was written keeping in mind the success and straightforward approach of Bourne Identity, and so the writers didn't attempt at making the dialogs richer and juicier to avoid any risks. But it is taking these risks that lead to better results. The cinematographer took some risks by fast cutting his action sequences and they did work but only at times, and that's because he went for overkill. The car chase sequence in Russia could've been so much impactful had the camera not jumped like every quarter a second. The result was that I had no idea who was ramming or shooting whom. Also in the starting sequence at the Berlin office where the camera moves constantly between so many characters it's difficult to get what's happening but more importantly you give up and just wait for the next segment to start normally. Even the car chase with Bourne and Marie was ruined by the jumpy camera. The scenes with Bourne and Irena Neski, daughter of late politician Neski, where the camera does not cut between frames that much, although the shaky camera is still present, and Bourne and Landy, where their faces are seen in profile on the left and right of the frame, are more memorable because we as the audience pay attention. Bourne Supremacy ultimately works because it has all the basic formal elements to keep the viewers engaged. I don't know whether this was intended as a metaphor, but I found two places where Bourne notices blood on his hands, and he tries to wash it off in one scene. But, against his wish, blood shall always remain on his hands and he'll never get the peace that he wants. Hence come Bourne Ultimatum and Bourne Legacy (and more). I'm glad they forwent the idea of restricting much of the film to an Indian jail (they had planned this in an alternate script) since that would've been duller. But the scope of the film (the four locales – Russia, Germany, India and Italy) called for a stronger script with more well-rounded characters (in those terms, Mission Impossible 4 succeeded to a better extent).

137,mahmus,"An improvement over the first one, shaky cam and all.",8,1 October 2020,"This used to be my least favorite of the first three, but seeing it again for the third time, I realize how much better than the first one it is. It's better paced and less dated. I never hated Marie, but her absence does speed things up.It might have been a bad idea to watch this with a headache though.
While the film's use of shaky cam and quick cutting is infinitely better than most other action movies of the time (especially during the amazing climactic car chase) it's definitely not as well done as in the third one (the fight with the magazine is pretty bad).Karl Urban is the series' best villain.",The Bourne Supremacy
138,movieguy1021,The Bourne Supremacy: 5/10,5,2 August 2004,"Ah, the summer action sequel. It's inevitable, isn't it? With few exceptions, most of them are generic, mindless movies that are marketed well enough to get at least $100 million. For the most part, The Bourne Supremacy fits the bill. It's a sequel (to 2002's The Bourne Identity), it's released in the summer, it's generic but not exactly mindless, and it's marketed well enough to get a good amount of money (although it needs to get more than expected with the flop of Thunderbirds for Universal. Based on the series of books by Robert Ludlum, Supremacy fails where Identity succeeded. Direction. Identity's director was Doug Liman, known for such cult favorites as Go and Swingers, which served the first well with a balance of action and drama. Supremacy's director is Paul Greengrass, who last did Bloody Sunday. Why they picked him to direct this sequel that he ruined, I have no idea.Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), amnesiac former killer for the CIA, is being hunted again by the CIA, as he is framed for a crime he did not commit. He must run to various exotic locations (which sell Lays potato chips, by the way) to escape nameless bad guys. Chris Cooper's character, Conklin, has since died and now Brian Cox takes center stage, showing what a cool actor he is. Joan Allen (unrecognizable to me) plays a random worker in the CIA (see also Julia Stiles, Gabriel Mann).I think Supremacy is the perfect example of how one thing can ruin a movie. The choice of using hand-held cameras is disastrous. Greengrass (who probably is using cameras left over from Sunday) seems to think that the less of a picture you can comprehend, the better it is. During the non-action scenes (much like what annoyed me about Man on Fire), the camera couldn't keep still for a second, making it hard to understand what was happening on screen. Why? Although I understand the want for ""authenticity"" for the action scenes, is it really hard to put a camera on a tripod to keep everything still for a couple seconds? And people thought The Blair Witch Project was sickening.... Even during the action scenes, I had no idea what was really happening not only because of the camera work but also because of the lack of development of any of the non-important characters. There are a couple random Russians, a couple random Americans, and they fight. Why? Who knows?On the other hand, even though the action scenes are indecipherable, they were fun to watch. They weren't as fun as the ones in Identity, but they were worthy nonetheless. The car chase scene (completely thrown in randomly) wasn't as energetic as it could have been, and considering the aforementioned atrocity of the camera, I guess it couldn't really have been better. Still, during the fight and action scenes, it was entertaining. The movie as a whole was tolerable, partially engaging, and never left you bored, which is good enough, I suppose. It's not constantly thrilling, but it's not boring.Damon definitely isn't as into his role as he was in Identity. He's basically sleepwalking through his role. Franka Potente has a small role in this one, but she reprises her role as Marie. Personally, I think she was much better in Run Lola Run. Hell, it could be the only thing she's great in. But forget those two. The man on the screen is Brian Cox, as I've said. This man can do anything, act well, and be completely cool while he's at it. He's one of the coolest actors out there besides Ving Rhames, Sam Jackson, and R. Lee Ermey. But Cox can't save The Bourne Supremacy. It may have its moments, but add up a whole lot of moments and you'll barely get a second.My reviews: 5/10Rated PG-13 for violence and intense action, and for brief language.",The Bourne Supremacy

141,Antagonisten,Disappointment,5,23 January 2005,"I thought the first ""Bourne Identity"" with Matt Damon was a good agent thriller. Both when it came to acting and action. But this second installment fails to deliver, mostly because of clumsy action sequences.Agent Jason Bourne tried to hide from the agency he worked for. But now they have found him and framed him for murder. He has to use his skills to survive and clear his name.The set-up here is pretty much as it was in the first movie. We have our hero and we have the mystical government agency hunting him. But several things are missing that made the first movie great. First of all the story feels uninteresting here. We have seen it all before, and seeing Bourne run around the same way (for the same reasons) as in the first movie holds a limited appeal. Also Bourne never feels out-gunned the way he does in the first movie. Here it feels like he is the one running the show, while he tried desperately to stay alive and mostly had to run in the first movie.But the main drawback is without doubt the action sequences. When is Hollywood going to learn not to let a spastic handle the camera?! As soon as something happens (a fight, a car chase, someone shooting) the camera starts shaking uncontrollably. This is a popular Hollywood-technique. Especially when using actors who can't fight properly, because when you shake the camera like this it's impossible to see what's going on. Unfortunately this also rather limits the entertainment value to say the least.So, with a more interesting story and camera work worth the name this could have been great. Matt Damon is still good, Karl Urban is vicious as his opponent and Brian Cox has long since perfected his ""evil-agency-boss"". This experience is sad, not just because of what it is, but also because of what it COULD have been. I rate it 5/10.",The Bourne Supremacy

It's a faster paced film than the prequel, so you really do need to pay attention to follow what is fully going on (just like the first film) and it still combines action and story really well.This is a pretty short review, but I think the film does all the talking needed.An enjoyable movie and very much recommended.",The Bourne Supremacy

I didn't care for this movie at all. It was the obligatory sequel to something good and follows the classic plot for any sequel of this kind. It's s revenge story, I think. I actually don't really know. The movie was so boring that I didn't really process it in it's entirety. The performances got much worse, with Matt Damon in particular suffering. It's like he didn't want to be in this movie, like he agreed with me in that this was a sequel that didn't need to happen. The rest of the performances are still just fine, nothing to run home about. The action scenes were actually pretty boring. The excessive shaky cam got on my nerves quicker than I expected, and it all just gets repetitive and, again, boring. Overall The Bourne Supremacy is just another obligatory boring sequel that doesn't try anything new. It's not exactly a bad movie, but it really isn't very good either. Maybe I'll have to see it again, but it's certainly a step down from the first one. In the end I wouldn't really recommend this movie.",The Bourne Supremacy
145,Rickting,"Something's missing, but it's well plotted and is one of the few films that makes shaky cam art",7,18 October 2014,"I was not impressed with The Bourne Identity. It's an emotionless and unfun movie with action sequences that inexplicably stop trying half way through. Interestingly, the film is set 2 years afterwards, with Bourne pursuing the people who framed him for a CIA operation gone wrong and it was almost 2 years before I could be bothered to watch the second one, so it's close to real time for me. The second film is a huge improvement, although still weak compared to Die Hard, James Bond and various other action films. What sets it apart is Paul Greengrass who may be the only director who truly turns hand-held cameras into an art form, and the film actually uses shaky cam properly. The influence of the Bourne films is unfortunate, as most action films don't necessarily know how to handle shaky filming and a darker tone, and sadly James Bond has suffered from the Bourne effect as well. This knows how to handle its elements and was the Bourne film I enjoyed the most.The plot is more interesting than normal with its themes of conspiracy and memory loss, while the set pieces seem fairly varied although there are too many chase sequences. The script is decent and in general it is a compelling action thriller with a pleasing sense of intensity and there is some sort of emotional centre in there as well. What lets it down? What lets it down is officially the worst action hero ever committed to film, who barely changes his facial expression once and has absolutely no personality. Although there's some emotion, the film can go on and it does occasionally feel like a compilation of chase sequences. I did enjoy it though and it's quite entertaining, and it's got punch for sure. I feel action films need to have humour usually to balance their ludicrousness and implausibility. The Bourne Supremacy, while not a great or especially memorable film and nowhere close to Captain Phillips or United 93, is a superior sequel and a diverting explosion of gritty, hand-held, intense blockbuster fun.7/10",The Bourne Supremacy

148,CinematicInceptions,"Not the greatest action film out there, but worth seeing.",7,9 April 2015,"Though there are certainly better spy movies out there, this is in the upper half of spy movies I've seen. It's not perfect in any regard, though it does some things that other movies of its kind do not. I felt like it was a half-step up from Identity, and far better than the disappointing Legacy. I don't know how well it sticks to the original novel, but I also haven't heard anything criticizing it in that regard.I'll start with the disappointments. Though I didn't feel like it detracted too much, Bourne's motive of discovering his past is touched upon only lightly in this sequel. There are a few brief flashbacks and even a scene at the end where he apologizes to a girl who's parents he killed before his amnesia. Another potential letdown is the editing and cinematography of the action sequences. The thing that disappointed me the most about the movie was that the government agents chasing him were given a very standard script. I kind of feel like a movie such as this should be above the worn out government employee tone that all of them use. Exchanges such as ""Who's giving him orders now?"" ""Scary version? He is."" did not improve this. Fortunately, Boure does not have such duologue like that.The story is not one that you can predict, nor is it overly interesting. This is mostly accounted for by the action driven plot, where you don't need to know why a fight is going on, only that Bourne is the good guy. Consequently, the plot can get a little confusing at times. Although he is at the center of the plot, Jason Bourne does not progress it very much. Rather, Pamela Landy and her agency try to bring Bourne into custody while dealing with problems within their agency, mostly caused by Brian Cox's character. One plot driven scene that I thought was pretty interesting and different was the scene when one of Landy's subordinates demonstrates how Bourne was set up in the beginning sequence in Germany. By the end, we can kind of see how Jason Bourne has gained ""supremacy"" over his adversaries by always being one step ahead of them and thwarting their every move.There are very few main characters, and none have an exceptional amount of depth. Bourne's character is advanced a little as he starts to realize that he caused a lot of pain before his amnesia. The death of Marie at the beginning also gives him some consistent depth. Pamela Landy obviously has strong motives and isn't really an antagonist, but isn't someone that you can sympathize with either. Brian Cox's character is definitely the antagonist, and you can tell that he's trouble right from the start, though his villainy is not revealed until later.The action has some distinctive highs and lows. The best sequence, in my opinion, was the fight at the apartment in Italy because it was displayed clearly enough that you could follow it, and it was just a generally solid one on one brawl. Several of the times when Bourne single handedly takes out security guards or some other government worker with a superior firearm were also executed well and added to his ""supremacy"". However, the extended chase scenes, particularly the car chase at the end, could have used a bit of work. The acting was slightly above par, with the best performance coming from Damon. As stated previously, the editing and cinematography could definitely have been better. John Powell's exotic score was at about B level. The directing was pretty good with the city scenes.One could argue that it's not as good as Identity because of the storyline, but it's easily better than Mission Impossible 2 and 3, both of which were pretty big letdowns. That said, it's not at the same level as Casino Royale, my personal favorite spy film. In all, it did a decent job, but could have improved in a couple of spots.

Too bad then, that it has at least two lengthy car chase scenes (one of them must be close to five minutes long). These scenes were just a waste of time according to me. Also, the movie would have benefited from being about 15 minutes shorter.I love the last scene in Russia, though. Bourne talks to the daughter of a couple he has murdered and confesses the murder.

So, however you felt about the first installment, you'll feel the same about this one.This time, the action is much more global, moving around the world. The stakes are a bit higher. The CIA team is much bigger. The action roller coaster ride is more intense. The romance is out of the picture. The story is less dark and a tiny fraction less serious.Matt Damon is just as good as in the previous episode. I wish we'd seen more of Franka Potente, because I like her and her character. Joan Allen plays her bitchy role pretty well. Brian Cox's character is the one you want to slap around this time. And Julia Stiles is perfect in the reprise of her small role. I love her in that movie, and she has the best line of the whole ensemble.What I didn't like. Those dream sequences, a bit lame and badly put together. There's also that FSB agent that is just too one-dimensional.An other great action flick.",The Bourne Supremacy
153,Flagrant-Baronessa,"A much more interesting, camp-free James Bond",8,17 July 2006,"The Bourne series are, without a doubt, the Bond films of the 21st century. What is even better is that they are the Bond we've been waiting for: one without the cheese, sleaze, camp predictable villains and cheap puns. This second installment in the series is a well-made, engaging adrenaline-booster and surprisingly every bit as good as The Bourne Identity.Once again, we get to follow Matt Damon as Jason Bourne on the search for his lost identity. He had initially planned on putting his past behind him, but it sneaks up on him in the form of an assassination attempt in Thailand - while he is enjoying his life with Marie (Franka Potente). What I love about Franka Potente is that she is such a natural beauty and not in-your-face gorgeous like Bond girls and the like. It all fits with the low-key style of the film.This film has mostly moved away from the flashy technology and violent showdowns of its fellow action-thrillers. Bourne Supremacy instead moves back to more traditional kinds of action, just like The Bourne Identity did. Its focus is the chase, not the confrontation or the gadgets. It is extraordinarily refreshing to see an action film like this, even more when it accomplishes everything it sets out to do and has so much brains.The only minus to The Bourne Supremacy is its shaky, dizzying camera-work. I know a lot of people have complained about this, and usually I would disagree because this kind of cinematography can be a good thing, but it goes slightly overboard in the film at several points. 8/10",The Bourne Supremacy

But it is all shattered as a hit-man finds Bourne in a distant land. A place to call home, and a place to bury his love. When Maria is shot and killed, Bourne becomes the last man the section wanted to pee off. He begins to search for his loves killer, globe hopping all over the world showing the audience the rich displays of different countries and cities which harbour the hard and gritty life styles of the corrupt. Leading him from one continent to the next, and coming very close to seeing his own enemy back home in the states. His life however gets a reprieve and has an insider of a sort in a woman named Pamela Landy. A hardened woman who gets the job done her way and nobody else's. Bourne in his own manner admires her spirit and dedication as he keeps searching for clues which gives Landy doubt within her own government. This second instalment has all sorts of ingredients to keep the audience wanting more, and with Jason Bourne, he does not disappoint at all. Incredible film.",The Bourne Supremacy
155,Cinemaniac1984,"Just as good as the original movie, Matt Damon makes a welcome return as Jason Bourne in The Bourne Supremacy.",9,19 January 2017,"The Bourne Supremacy is a welcome follow up to the 2002 box office hit The Bourne Identity. Matt Damon makes a welcome return as former CIA assassin Jason Bourne who continues to be haunted by his past. Paul Greengrass takes over the director's chair from Doug Liman and he ensures that The Bourne Supremacy is just as good, if not better, as the original Bourne movie.The Bourne Supremacy picks up 2 years later from the original movie where Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, Saving Private Ryan) and Marie Kreutz (Franke Potente, Run Lola Run) have begun a new life in Goa, India. Jason Bourne is still being haunted by flashbacks from his past including the murder of a Russian Politician and his wife in a hotel room. Jason Bourne is brought to the attention of no-nonsense Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen, Face/Off) after Bourne's fingerprint was planted at an interrupted meeting in Berlin which resulted in the deaths of two CIA agents at the hands of Russian assassin Krill (Karl Urban, Dredd). Krill pursues Bourne and Marie in Goa which results in a fateful encounter which sees Bourne seeking out why his past has not left him alone. With Pamela Landy and shadowy Deputy Director Ward Abbott (Brian Cox, Manhunter) investigating why Bourne has seemingly come out of hiding, Bourne must yet again revisit his old life to find out who is after him, why has he been framed, and will his past ever go away. Matt Damon returns to his best role as Jason Bourne and wasn't it awesome to see him return. It was also fantastic to see several cast members return for the sequel include Franke Potente, Brian Cox, Julia Stiles, Gabriel Mann, and in flashbacks Chris Cooper. Joining the cast for the ride include Karl Urban (excellent as the main villain Krill), Joan Allen, and in small roles Martin Csokas and Michelle Monaghan.Director Paul Greengrass ensured that The Bourne Supremacy was just as good as the first by keeping the story flowing, the suspenseful action engaging, and audiences glued to their seats from start to finish. When I first saw The Bourne Supremacy, I thought it has lost a bit of impact with the irritating shaky camera. Numerous viewings later, I have reevaluated my opinion and I've thoroughly enjoyed The Bourne Supremacy each and every time I've watched it. The Bourne Supremacy was a welcome addition to the Bourne series and it comes as no surprise that it was very popular amongst audiences and critics making it a very successful hit at the box office in 2004.The Bourne Supremacy can be added to the list of sequels that has been just as good as the original movie. Sequels such as Mad Max 2 (1981), Aliens (1986), Lethal Weapon 2 (1989), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), The Dark Knight (2008) are some perfect examples and The Bourne Supremacy earns a well deserved spot on the coveted list.The Bourne Supremacy is still an excellent movie from start to finish by continuing to stick to its theme of staying true to its role a thinking man's action movie with spectacular stunts, fight scenes, action sequences and more twists and turns than a roller coaster ride, rightfully putting many no brainer action movies to shame. The Bourne Supremacy showed no signs of going stale or repeating itself by continuing to expand on the original movie and aiming to go one better. Fans of The Bourne Identity will not be disappointed.9/10.",The Bourne Supremacy
156,hokeybutt,Spy Movies Haven't Been This Cool Since The '60s,7,11 February 2005,"THE BOURNE SUPREMACY (3+ outta 5 stars) Nifty follow-up to ""The Bourne Identity"", one of the best action-thrillers to come out in recent years. Even though these movies don't skimp on excitement they also provide plenty of story and character development so that you don't feel you're being bombarded with one idiotic action sequence after another. The storyline isn't quite as gripping as the first... at times it seems to be just repeating itself... but ultimately the movie proves itself to be a worthy successor, thanks to the performances (Matt Damon as Bourne, Brian Cox as the head of a super-secret US spy agency... and the addition of Joan Allen as a determined investigator determined to track down and neutralize Bourne). Franka Potente doesn't have as much to do this time around... but Julia Stiles gets one especially intense scene that shows off her acting skills to the max. Yes, when you get right down to it the movie has a sense of ""been there, done that"" about it... but not very often are movies of this type done with this kind of skill and dedication... spy movies haven't been this cool since the '60s.",The Bourne Supremacy
157,supertom-3,Supreme!!!,9,1 November 2004,"The sequel to surprise hit The Bourne Identity is a superb accomplishment and is even better than the first film. This is a superbly intelligent and polished thriller and like the first film harks back to great espionage films from the 60's. It's delightfully reminiscent of classic films like The Ipcress File. The story this time has Bourne hiding away in Goa with his girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente.) He is found by a German spook (Karl Urban) and is on the receiving end of an assassination attempt, Bourne survives and Marie does not. The idea is to finally kill Bourne and then frame him for the killing of CIA agents after a botched deal, headed by Pamela Landy (Joan Allen.). Bourne now wants revenge and goes to Berlin to find out what happened he wants to face the Feds head on. The story naturally is full of double crossing and intrigue as any good spy thriller should have and it all unravels nicely. This story develops Bourne's character even further and the impact of Marie's death has great dramatic affect throughout the film as Bourne also begins to have memories of a mission he did in Berlin that holds importance to events happening now.Like the first installment, Matt Damon is excellent. He perfectly balances the inner fragility with the outer sternness and composure of Bourne's secret agent personality. Also as before Brian Cox is superb and his dodgy dealings come full circle. Karl Urban who is an up and comer thanks to his appearance in Lord Of The Rings 2 and 3 is also very good and has a presence in the film similar to Clive Owen in the first. Joan Allen is also very good and I have to say looking sexier than ever!The action in this film is pulsating. It's documentary like and puts you right in the action and the centre piece car chase is the action scene of the year, no question. The fact that all the car chases are reality based is something I love about this and indeed the first film. In amongst all the over the top, surrealistic action sequences in blockbusters (which I like in their own way) this is a refreshingly exciting collection of action scenes that feel realistic, there are no 100 ft high explosions or cars that hurtle 50ft through the air. It's crunching, superbly choreographed stunt work, real crashes, real physics and real carnage. Much like the superlative car chases in Ronin the chases here are amazing.Overall this is a great thriller narrowly beating out the first film. It's great to have an action film with character, acting, an intelligent script and also with genuine tension and atmosphere. Not to be missed. ****½",The Bourne Supremacy
158,dead47548,Greengrass ups the style of this remarkable franchise.,9,9 January 2008,"One of the few instances of a sequel being superior to it's original. The Bourne Supremacy increases the action and deepens the story that the original mastered. The action is much grittier, crisp and natural. The performances are the same, notably Damon's who fine tunes his amnesia into a sense of dedicated revenge. Joan Allen was perfectly casted in a performance made to rival Brian Cox's commanding drive. Joan Allen really commands the screen every time she is on, much like she does in every role. She was prefect for the part. The car chase is the greatest I've ever seen. It's wonderfully authentic and realistic. Paul Greengrass was perfect for directing this film. His gritty, hand-held style makes it feel like you are there watching the action occur, most notably performed during the fight between Bourne and the last Treadstone assassin with the magazine. Julia Stiles' wonderful performance should also be mentioned. My only big complaint is that Karl Urban butchers Russian whenever he speaks it, getting most of his lines wrong. Still the epitome of the espionage thriller and one of the best films of the packed 2004.",The Bourne Supremacy
159,EthanBJones_03,This is the Bourne movie I expected.,7,12 July 2017,"'THE BOURNE SUPREMACY' was directed by Paul Greengrass and stars Matt Damon, Joan Allen and Brian Cox. ​Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is living in India when he is framed by Russian agent Kirill (Karl Urban) for the theft of millions from the CIA. Kirill begins to pursue Bourne, intending to assassinate him -- but while Bourne and his girlfriend, Marie (Franka Potente), are on the run, a shot meant for him kills her instead. Vowing revenge, Bourne sets out to prove his innocence and bring the culprits to justice, but he has to evade CIA head Pamela Landry (Joan Allen), who is convinced he is guilty.I actively dislike 'The Bourne Identity'. I was very disappointed by it and don't understand the love for it. Thus, I put off seeing this movie for quite some time. I regret doing so. 'The Bourne Supremacy' trumps its predecessor in pretty much every conceivable way. Franka Potente's character, Marie Kreutz, from the first was probably my least favourite part of the movie and she's gone! I imagine this upset many people but I personally was delirious with it and love the arc change it gives to Bourne. Enough comparisons, let's get into what makes this movie great.The story. I really like the story for this movie but I don't know why. It shouldn't work for me but there is some mystery and government conspiracy that entices me to like it. I know that this is basically a good way to describe the plot of Identity but it felt so much more refined in this one than it did with Identity. I do have issues with the way the film ends, however. It feels kinda anti-climactic and the final scene is very weak, without context from Ultimatum. I wont spoil the ending but I just wasn't very satisfied by it.Damon was good in Identity and I will say he was probably the best part of the film. We see his transformation into Bourne at the end and that is fully explored in this movie, and that benefits Damon immensely. It enables him to give a brilliant performance that delves deep into Bourne's mind and portrays a unique blend of pure, unfiltered emotion and pure, unfiltered awesomeness. Opposing Bourne is my least favourite aspect of this film. The villain is very weak overall and I was not impressed or entertained by them in the slightest. Karl Urban's Kiril was pretty cool and provided a physical opposition to Bourne but had too little backstory and motivation to make me really feel invested in his character or care. I get he is a contract killer and that is fine but I would have liked more explanation to his character and background.Joan Allen was very good as Pamela Landy and was a very welcome addition to the cast. Brian Cox was great as Ward Abbot but I would have liked a little more from him in the long run character wise. The other, more minor supporting cast, all did fine jobs and none of them actively irked me, performance wise.Aside from ONE poorly done action scene in this movie, the movie was well shot, directed and edited together. Greengrass remains the only living director capable of using hand-held cam effectively and, while he perfects the craft later on, utilises the unpopular technique effectively here. There are next to no special effects in this movie which is both phenomenal and admirable for an action film in this day and age and I cannot thank the crew enough for that.This is more minor but I love the score for these movies. It's awesome and amazing and badass and has earned my love. I rarely comment on a film's score unless I like it a lot so good job to the composers.In conclusion, I really liked The Bourne Supremacy. If, like me, you didn't like Identity, I still urge you to give this one a shot. It's got great acting, good action, an interesting story, and while the villain does drag it down a peg or two, it is still a thrilling ride from beginning to end. I'll rate this movie a solid 7 Stalking Bournes out of 10 and definitely recommend you see this great movie.",The Bourne Supremacy
160,christian123,Great sequel that improves on the original,8,6 February 2005,"The Bourne Supremacy is a very entertaining action movie and even though it feels and looks like the original its still a great sequel. In The Bourne Identity, sleeper agent/assassin Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) went on the run from his own agency, the CIA, when they tried to take him out of commission. Although he thought his troubles were over, he is forced back into the life when he is framed for a botched CIA operation, so he takes the fight back to them while trying to find out more about his past and the memories that haunt him. The plot is very good and it is carried out well by a talented cast. The film keeps you on the edge of your seat and you most likely won't be bored. The best new addition to the cast is Joan Allen and she gives a really good performance. Matt Damon is once again Jason Bourne and he gives a great performance. Brian Cox is also back and I like him this time around because he dies and you don't have to deal with him anymore. The last main part of the cast is Julia Stiles and she may actually have a future ahead of her in Hollywood. Paul Greengrass directs and he does a good job of replacing Doug Liman. The direction is really good and it keeps its audience interested and it keeps you guessing right until the end. Some people will complain that there's nothing new and its not worth the time to watch but its a lot more exciting then the original. Rating 8/10 a nearly flawless action movie that improves over the original. I recommend you see this movie it won't disappoint you.",The Bourne Supremacy

This causes Jason Bourne to respond to a previous threat he made...Anybody from his past life that confronted him, he'd get revenge. He sets out to find out what happened and why he's being blamed.A lot of the principal players return for this sequel, and it's good to see how their characters evolved since the first film. Some new characters are present as well, and they are good additions to the series. Matt Damon is even better as Bourne this time around, seeing as he's comfortable in the role now. I really enjoyed Joan Allen in her role as well.The movie never gets too boring, and there is a nice blend between the action and the drama. This movie also features one of the best car chases since Bullitt. The only big flaw is the cinematography. The camera whips around so fast in some scenes that you can barely see what's going on. The movie ends with promise of a third installment, and I personally can't wait.8/10",The Bourne Supremacy

While enjoying life with his girlfriend in India, a mysterious man comes into town with a killer look in his eye. Turns out he's an assassin sent to kill him. Bourne escapes, but his girlfriend isn't as lucky (ie she gets shot, then drowns). Bourne starts doing some hunting and discovers he's got a huge price on his head. Bourne finds out what's happening and who's after him, but will he escape? See it to find out (but I'll give you a hint, the new Bourne movie comes out this month, and Matt Damon's in it,so.......).Once again excellent action, with some great scenes, most notably in the interrogation room and when he tracks down the the first Treadstone guy.

164,kgprophet,Too Much Shaky Cam! (minor spoiler),6,23 July 2004,"I give this sequel a marginal thumbs up,  but I have two major problems.I still have a headache from the first problem.  The shooting style revives the trendy ""shaky cam"" which translates into ""someone who can't hold the camera steady is shooting something supposedly spontaneous and compelling'"". TV series andcommercials used this style to excess and has thankfully receded to only a few places. The big problem when you do the Shaky cam to excess,  is that when EVERYTHING is ""spontaneous and compelling"" then NOTHING takes on greater urgency.  When this type of shot is used sparingly (someone is shot and fighting for his life),  you get that ""Cops"" kind of reality.  This film takes it too far.  As much as I believe a director should try to take chances and try to be original,  you have to know when you are drawing too much attention to the style and distracting from the story.  This is especially ineffective in the action scenes.  But wait - that's when you SHOULD have that urgent kind of camerawork, right?.  The problem is,  the action scenes are shot in Super-Shaky Cam.  I literally could not follow a big fight scene,  and had a hard time appreciating the car chase because the frame was too blurry to make anything out.  This really disappoints me,  because there is a good franchise in the works here.  The gritty and smart Bourne shows a sharp focus on cutting to the chase and treats anything else as a waste of time.  Joan Allen is the very apt CIA chief who refuses to look the other way, and she holds the screen with as much energy as Chris Cooper did in the first film. Brian Cox does a great job of giving you that ""Oh God I'm screwed"" look. The locations once again are rich in texture,  no pretty shots of Red Square.  I have to give the first film a better rating for one big reason - (*MINOR SPOILER*)This film leaves Bourne chasing around to save himself without a nice looking girl by his side.  The James Bond comparisons to this new kind of spy are more accurate when you get the hot chick into the mix.  The lovely Julia Stiles only gets as much screen time as she did in the first,  too bad.     (*END SPOILER*)I give this a 6 out of 10.",The Bourne Supremacy

The plot works, the script was excellent, Matt Damon delivers. But when I saw the film on the big screen, I suffered from ""Blair Witch Syndrome."" Being in a crowded theatre and having to sit on the third row, the constant wiggling of the hand held cameras and the jouncing and Sudan spinning around during the chases made me so sick I had to leave halfway through the movie. The same thing happened to me during the Blair Witch Project. Actually the film improved greatly, at least for me on the small screen. It is still a good action-packed thriller and did well enough that another sequel is due out soon. I just hope the director of the next one doesn't fall too much in love with hand held cameras.

And in a strange yet exceptional way, I like that.Bourne is the name he is given and his missions were fore a black government program. But when that all shuts down, they try to kill him and frame him for certain murders. And when a certain person in his life is killed because of it, Bourne takes exception to it all.There are some nice car chases and shootouts in the movie. Plus some of the kills were just nice. While it isn't ""Hitman"" or ""Shooter"" in that regard, it does a good enough job.Overall, nicely done. I actually want to see more now to see if they get better. ""B""",The Bourne Supremacy

Therefore I would give it 9/10 and not 10/10. It's a good story, state-of-the-art action and suspense, etc., however I still think it's pretty silly judging it from outside its genre. Surely there is no reason to use tax-payers money on all this silly stuff. I really like the scene where Bourney is in Moscow and he steals the Vodka, and drinks from the bottle while beating up police. This is awesome stuff that Indiana Jones would have been proud of. It really reminded me of some of my own traveling around the world. Moreover, the woman he meets in AlexanderstraBe is REALLY cute and hot-looking! Just my type.

169,Quicksand,The Bourne Spy Project,8,24 July 2004,"It's weird reading my original comment on ""The Bourne Identity,"" because it turns out Chris Cooper is NOT uncharismatic (I still hated him in ""Lone Star""), and more importantly, Tony Gilroy does not suck.The writing here is the best part.  It's been two years and I still haven't gotten around to reading the book, but as a stand-alone film, the three sides butting heads is an effective and well-realized spy thriller.  No great one-liners, but some well-defined characters (and character acting) from everyone involved.  Even Julia Stiles.Was the decision to shoot the entire movie like ""The Blair Witch Project"" intentional, or just bad filmmaking?  This is the first American film from director Paul Greengrass, and I'm not familiar with his work-- but when there's SO much more going on than three kids in a forest, isn't it important that we actually see the locations, the actors, the thrown punches and the crashed cars?Cinemtograher Oliver Wood also shot the first film, so I'm not really sure what happened.  There's a fight in an apartment during the first third of the film, and I couldn't see anything at all.  The rest of the movie was just a hair better.  If your Uncle Pete showed you a home movie shot like this, you'd turn it off in the middle.  The writing, the STORY, kept me riveted, but the movie I made in my head is much better than the schizophrenic, 40-jump-cuts-a-minute film I just watched.Which is not to say the film should have been a prettily-shot, sterile Hollywood production.  I understand they were going for gritty.  I think they overshot their goal.... and I'm not mad at them, I'm just really kind of irritated.  You could've handed the camera to someone else, Uncle Pete.

170,bix171,The Bourne Supremacy,7,6 January 2014,"At the end, Tony Gilroy's ham-fisted screenplay ponderously verbalizes what Matt Damon's sensitive performance has already conveyed throughout--that for what it's worth, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is about guilt and atonement. Until that point, though, it's director Paul Greengrass' thrill ride, pure and simple, and it really is a rush, with a story told through hand-held cameras (the director of photography is Oliver Wood) and editing (by Richard Pearson and Christopher Rouse), both effective enough to deflect the violence that concludes many of the set pieces. Damon is perfectly cast as the amnesiac Bourne, who struggles to find his reality while methodically resetting the world around him with laser focus.

I saw this shortly after seeing I, Robot which I had been expecting to be more in the style of the other films by Alex Proyas like Dark City and The Crow but I was disappointed that it was just another Will Smith film.The story is pretty simple and straight forward with no real big surprises but if you are looking for something with style, The Bourne Supremacy is one of the better flicks for the summer.",The Bourne Supremacy

Characters appeared on the screen without any context. The editing was horrific. There were very short edits and a lot of spinning whirling camera. If the point was to impart the confusion that our protagonist was feeling, it was successful. However, this lead to a nearly incomprehensible movie. I guess I am just a little bit too old for the MTV, short-attention span approach to video. If I want disorientation, I will do it the old fashioned way and have one to many martinis.The acting (at least what little acting is needed in a film of this type) was good. I like Matt Damon as an actor.I have to admit, the car chase scene was one of the best I have seen in a movie. It beat the heck out of the Bullit chase scene that is so often cited as the definitive car chase.In all, this was a disappoint for me.

Jason Bourne has to come out of hiding to find out who is trying to kill him and why.  The CIA suspects Bourne of murdering two of their agents.  This is a great cat and mouse espionage thriller that ranks up there with From Russia With Love (sorry Goldfinger fans, but that was the best Connery Bond film).  Julia Stiles also returns as Nicki and has a little bit more to do this time, even though it is still a glorified cameo.  For the third Bourne movie, I would like to see Stiles with Matt Damon as possibly a love interest.  It would be a good change of pace for her who is known for teenage dramas and comedies to play more adult roles.  Matt Damon is excellent as Jason Bourne and I would like to see him again in this role.  Joan Allen is also good as the CIA boss obsessed with Bourne's capture.

176,Cedric_Catsuits,Disappointing as a sequel,9,24 May 2006,"I can't help but compare this to it's predecessor, and I'm afraid it just doesn't come up to scratch. I note a change of director and I wonder if this is the reason - parts of the film are certainly badly shot, and the car chase is almost unwatchable due to constant cutting, stupid camera angles etc. It made me feel sick for all the wrong reasons. I think this is a classic case of 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' and The Bourne Identity certainly wasn't broke (I'd have it in my all-time top 5 movies.) Where the Identity hit you hard and fast and kept running at a frantic pace, constant adrenalin-rush and thrills combined with great plot, this lumbers along in fits and starts. For me it gets off to the worst possible start with the death of one of the two main characters, though others will say this is beneficial to the story. The first real action takes a whopping 30 minutes to materialize, and then it's all stop-start until the ending where suddenly it decides to replicate the first movie by signing-off with Moby's 'Extreme Ways' - happily this is one of my favourite songs, but it's not enough to make me believe this movie is in any way comparable to the first.Don't get me wrong - this is still a very good and enjoyable movie. But it could, and should, have been very much better. Damon looks overweight, tired, and struggles to convey the same highly-tuned killing machine we saw in Identity. Maybe that's just being realistic, and we don't really know what he's been up to since the first movie ended. But the lack of the de-humanized, automaton-like weapon angle that made the first movie so sharp and exciting, means this has to rely on plot and action. Both are decidedly average, and the idea of Bourne on a bloody, destructive chase across Europe just so he can tell some girl he killed her parents, is bordering on silly.I can't help but feel this was a (sadly typical) cynical attempt to cash-in on a truly great film. Maybe Franka Potente got-off lightly by getting killed after 20 minutes! I still rate it as above average, and Damon is one of my favourite actors. Sorry but I don't hold out much hope for Ultimatum with Greengrass in charge. Note to Doug Liman - please get back in your director's chair!",The Bourne Supremacy
177,thenolanfan,Review - The Bourne Supremacy,7,26 September 2020,"The film is a satisfying sequel to The Bourne Identity as far as storytelling goes. Unlike the James Bond and the Mission Impossible franchises, The Bourne films are connected by their intrigue, Tony Gilroy did a good job at connecting the dots.The Bourne Supremacy's biggest flaw comes from the switch of the director. Where Doug Liman was bad to film action Paul Greengrass is awful. As far as I'm concerned, the action scenes are awfully filmed. It is a pity considering that there are some talents in the choreography department.The last problem is Brian Cox. His character, Ward Abbot, doesn't have the same complexity that Conklin had with Bourne. Thus, as the main villain, he is extremely disappointing.",The Bourne Supremacy
178,tburke85,The Bourne Supremacy A Worthy Sequel,8,19 June 2009,"The Bourne Supremacy is a worthy sequel from director Paul Greengrass whose admirable in making this giving audiences what they expect from one of these movies. Matt Damon is back as Jason Bourne and he continues to be the perfect choice for the role. Frank Potente also reprises her role as Bournes love Marie from the first film but her part in this one unfortunately is cut really short. The rest of the cast including Brian Cox, Gabriel Mann, Karl Urban, Julia Stiles, and Joan Allen are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The rest of the cast are good in their roles as well. The action/fight sequences and chases are well executed even though some of them can be a bit of a stretch. The movie had a steady pace mainly because of the action and the ending was fitting. Despite some flaws with character development and the lack of a more central villain, The Bourne Supremacy is definitely one of the better sequels out there. Overall this movie had just enough intense action, fist fights, chases, suspense, thrills, and exceptional performances by the cast especially Damon who makes this sequel worth the time to watch.",The Bourne Supremacy
179,anhedonia,"The most entertaining blockbuster of the year, so far",8,28 July 2004,"Intelligent action-thrillers are so infrequent these days that when a film like ""The Bourne Supremacy"" comes along, I savor the moment.Honestly, I don't know what critics who were confused by the plot of ""The Bourne Supremacy"" were braying about. If you pay attention - and this is a film that requires us to actually do that, oh the horror! - the plot is anything but confusing. Is it possible audiences have become so numbed by mindless summer actioners that when a film actually requires them to fit together pieces of the plot, many are promptly confused?I also expected to be seasick given the numerous complaints on this site and by critics about director Paul Greengrass' decision to shoot plenty of handheld scenes. Granted, some of the action's jerky, but I didn't find it distracting in the least. In fact, it only added to chaotic nature of Jason Bourne's life.He skillfully uses the handheld method during an absolutely sensational car chase. It's not conventionally shot, that's for sure, and proves to be a refreshing - pardon the pun - change of pace. We don't get the customary shots of each driver behind the wheel, then the steering wheels, then the long-shot down the tunnel, then the points-of-view of each driver, then the spinning car wheels, then back to the close-up of the driver. There was nothing graceful about Greengrass' filming of the chase and that's exactly how it should have been. He brilliantly captures the mayhem of that moment and turned it into an adrenaline rush.This is a thinking-person's film. Screenwriter Tony Gilroy (who also penned the script for 2002's ""The Bourne Identity"") trusts his audience and doesn't dumb down the story.Instead of giving us standard wisecracking characters, outlandish visual effects and people we couldn't care less about, Gilroy wrote a terrifically efficient script, giving supporting players like Joan Allen, Julia Stiles and Brian Cox small, but juicy, moments. True, he plays within the conventions of the genre when it comes to villains, but that fact hardly diminishes our enjoyment.Gilroy's made Bourne cool, smart, quick-thinking. I loved how deftly Jason improvised to get out of jams, finding novel uses for a toaster and rolled-up magazine and a speedy way to tap a cell phone.
Matt Damon proves to be an ideal Bourne. He's calm, emotionally restrained. There's nothing flashy about him. Damon humanizes Bourne and brings a level of depth to this character that's rare in contemporary spy/action films. With this film, Damon shows he might be a better actor than many believe.Having been pleasantly surprised by Doug Liman's film two years ago, I was hopeful the sequel would be equally as good. I wasn't disappointed.
""The Bourne Supremacy"" is tense, action-filled and, above all, thoroughly entertaining. In a summer that gave us bombastic, bloated, boring blockbusters, such as ""Troy,"" ""Van Helsing,"" ""King Arthur"" and ""Catwoman,"" this film proves that a well-told story, bright writing, fascinating characters and electrifying storytelling always trump even the most eye-popping special-effects wizardry.",The Bourne Supremacy
180,Aly200,Bourne Returns with a Vengeance,9,21 August 2016,"With a new director at the helm in Paul Greengrass and the return of star Matt Damon, this second film in the Jason Bourne series amps up the tension from frame one and never lets go. Damon remains in fine form as the amnesiac super spy; building on his character arc even more as Bourne starts having memories come back from his checkered past. We begin to learn more about the events that lead to the happenings of the first movie; who Bourne had been after when he was attacked and left for dead, more information about Project Treadstone and its operations and why they are so keen on Bourne being eliminated. Damon's chemistry with his costars remains captivating as he must play cat and mouse with the CIA and deals with grief when his lover, Marie, is killed in the film's opening act.Joining the game is an excellent Joan Allen as Pamela Landy, the new head of the task force that must capture Bourne at all costs. Allen does a top notch job playing Pam as neutral as possible even though she is adversarial at first to Damon's Bourne because she thinks he is killing her operatives, but her sympathetic side surfaces when she learns who is actually behind the deed and decides to aid Bourne's search for truth. Joining Allen but playing the real villain-like role is Brian Cox as Treadstone head Ward Abbott who will stop at nothing to rid the CIA of Jason Bourne in order to protect himself. Cox plays the role with a smooth gravitas that is not overdone or outright malevolent, but more subdued and calculated. And at last in the network of players is Julia Stiles as Nicky Parsons; Stiles appeared briefly in ""Bourne Identity"" as a minor character. Nicky is finally expanded upon and given a larger role to play as she holds one key to Jason Bourne's past. She stays mostly on the sidelines throughout the film, but becomes central by the climax.The film's narrative like its predecessor deviates from the source material it was based on. Killing off Bourne's love interest, Marie, in the first 30 minutes of the film is the biggest change that stands out. Marie remains alive in the novels upon which the trilogy is based (Bourne marries her and has a family by the ""Bourne Ultimatum""), but her death in the film is meant to add an extra personal touch for Bourne to return and go after Treadstone. The action remains tense and thrilling as Bourne fights his way to Washington, D.C. from all over Europe. This film is even better than the first, but in a class of its own.",The Bourne Supremacy
181,alfiefamily,"Good, not great sequel",7,18 December 2004,"""The Bourne Supremacy"" is a very professional, and respectable follow-up to the 2002 hit ""The Bourne Identity"". That being said, it is not nearly as involving or interesting as the original film either.Matt Damon returns as Jason Bourne, and does an admirable job of playing the amnesiac CIA operative, that only wants to be left alone.*****Spoilers***** The premise is simple. Bourne wants to live a quiet life, away from the CIA, he is implicated on a double murder, and he tries to clear his name.Again, the story is good, but it feels as though it is rushed along, in order to bring the movie in under two hours. Chase and fight scenes are not as good (especially the camera work), not much more is actually learned about Bourne, and nothing about his girlfriend or his life in India.Good movie to rent, but don't be upset if it's not in the store.7 out of 10",The Bourne Supremacy
182,Ziya90,Is this real?,10,24 January 2010,"Bourne Supremacy is one of my all time favorite action thriller movies. I had not expected that, I had supposed that it is just another action thriller, watch and enjoy, no more, but it was beyond great. The direction is not only very stylish, but sterile that makes the movie peculiar in a good way. The editing and camera usage are peculiar too, despite some people seriously complain about it, especially when it comes the car chase scenes. In the movie, there is not any cliché also, it shows that the director is a 'conscious' director, I watched some of his interviews and comments on the film and extremely impressed. The fight scene which takes place in Munich is very realistic and deliberately directed. I learned that the explosion was real that's why it was fresh and amazing. The movie is very consistent on all counts or should I say solid? As for clichés, Bourne does not make love with the women who he meets which is a revolution in action thriller movies. Women don't fall in love with him or he does not allure women. There is a scene that takes place in a railway station, it recalls The Jackal, this scene was impressive, it was jaw dropping and pretty stark. Karl Urban's character is somehow different from other usual villains, realistic? And yes, the car chase. One of the greatest car chases of all time. Some people seriously complain about the shaky camera in such scenes, but it was not annoying at all to me, if you say Transformers, yes it was, but I loved this one. Some shots are extremely short, shaky camera, but brilliant. Also this is one of the longest car chases ever made like Ronin. Bourne Supremacy is my favorite movie in the series by far.",The Bourne Supremacy

Plus, he's forced to go back to his life as an assassin to survive. The sequel is superior to the original ""The Bourne Identity"". It's full of action-packed thrills that sure to please any fans of action/adventure flicks.Matt Damon is excellent in any movie he's in and the roles he plays, that's why he's a popular actor of his time. The car chase scene in this one has been compared to the scene in ""Bullitt"". This car chase scene is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat, it's longer and more fast paced. The Bourne Supremacy is more proof that sequels can be better than the predeceasing movie. See this for the action, location shots of Europe, and Matt Damon. I give The Bourne Supremacy 4 stars!",The Bourne Supremacy
184,BigGuy,Another movie ruined by shaky cam,6,25 July 2004,"How long is it going to take Hollywood to learn that people hate the shaky cam?  Even the scenes in this movie that weren't shaky cam had that grainy focus and muted colors that seems to be all the style.  Simply put, the action sequences are impossible to see, and even many of the normal shots are annoyingly filmed.On the other hand, the story was pretty good.  Also Matt Damon does a good job playing Jason Bourne, and Joan Allen is good as his pseudo-nemesis CIA-deputy director Pam Landy.The story is that Jason Bourne is framed for a hit and the man who does the hit also tries to kill Jason.  Jason thinks it is the CIA and goes for some payback.6.5/10 (would have been much higher if I could have seen much of the movie!)",The Bourne Supremacy

Matt Damon reprises his role as the agent with amnesia on the run, trying to elude the killers he knows are out there looking for him. This film parallels the earlier Bourne film as the agent who flees from one trap or detention only to escape again in the manner of cliffhangers of years gone by. Karl Urban is the relentless Russian hit man who gets Damon in his sights a time or two, only to see him slip away. Joan Allen joins the chase as a steely CIA task force chief determined to bring Damon in by hook or crook. Much of the film was shot in Berlin and Moscow which gives the Bourne films an international flavor. John Powell chips in with a nice music score.",The Bourne Supremacy
186,lotus_chief,A worthy sequel that stayed true to the original.....,9,23 July 2004,"And that's basically all I was asking for with 'Bourne Supremacy'; seeing how much I enjoyed the original, 'Bourne Identity'.  After watching the trailer it was pretty obvious that they were going to stay true to what they started.  This is the reason why Bourne Supremacy works.  Matt Damon seems to have been 'born' for this role, he performs it very well.  Joan Allen was effective in her 'more subdued than normal' role.  The chase scene in the end was very entertaining....it probably ranks up there with other great chase scenes.  The hand-held camera technique gave the film a realistic feel, but I'll admit at times it was a little hard to see what was going on. The story here was as good as the first, and the pacing was right on....they don't waste any time getting in the thick of things, and that was good to see.  This 'Bourne' franchise really has something going here, and I feel as long as they stick to the formula they've mastered they could very well carry it even further.  It's smart espionage/political/spy/gov't material executed very well on film, regarding film technique as well as acting. It's safe to say that they're '2 for 2'; I'm anxious to see if they're going to continue this...if they are I'll be looking forward to those installments.***1/2 out of **** stars.",The Bourne Supremacy

This film doesn't quite fix up the issues neatly. I was expecting a little more conflict with ""Matt Damon's"" inner dogma, that's not what happens. Personally there needs to be more consequences for him, instead of a usual happy ending. So that the Gray area the film explores, ends more on a darkly sour note.",The Bourne Supremacy

Follows pretty well the previous entry. Must say that from here on I also prefer Matt Damon's acting.We have here too plenty of action sequences that are quite exciting, and the same music as in the previous episode, but maybe not that disturbing.Also we must say that there is relatively a small amount of blood and gore, which is good for people sensitive to that.Overall, go, watch it, possibly after seeing The Bourne Identity. it's worth.",The Bourne Supremacy
189,mgruebel,Surprisingly good second installment,7,1 November 2015,"The Bourne Identity was a refreshingly good spy thriller. Nothing like a man, who doesn't even know who he is, being hunted.In the second installment, Bourne (Matt Damon) finally gets to know his real name, but it's a small consolation for having his girlfriend killed when he's the one to be assassinated. The plot is a pretty good concoction. Bourne has retired to India, but he is rudely awakened out of that 10 year illusion of safety when a Russian operative tries to kill him. It's part of a plot to pin on him the disappearance of a case file and a lot of cash: no better stooge than a dead man with a past connection to the case. Two CIA agents are on his trail, one clean, one dirty (from the first installment), as said case file and cash have a bad history. To Bourne, locations in Berlin look just too awfully familiar, and he finally remembers what he did there on his first job, and why the dirty CIA man wants him dead. It's a cat-and-mouse game like the first one, with Bourne always barely a step ahead of the CIA agents trying to catch him. One agent wants Bourne alive, the other dead so he can retire instead of having to commit suicide. Well, guess how it comes out.There are the usual plot holes, such as Bourne running around and car-chasing with a bullet having gone through his shoulder, and mysteriously escaping Russia to get back to NY. Anyone who's ever broken bones in the shoulder knows that no matter the adrenaline, that's not how it works. It was also illogical for the dirty CIA man to kill an underling who's coming up with potentially incriminating information. It is even more incriminating, and his only real option is to just get Bourne killed as quickly as possible. The dirty agent pays for this very stupid mistake with suicide. There are other plot holes, but none really critical, so this remains fun to watch.Few films that are very good in the first place have even better sequels (maybe Star wars IV or Terminator?). ""Bourne Identity"" is no exception, but it had a sequel just about as good as the first, and ""Bourne Supremacy"" is still a welcome change from a lot of action spy movies these days. Some may find the ""immersed in the action"" camera work a bit annoying during chases, as the camera bangs into people and jostles around with Bourne and his pursuers. That and some plot holes and the ""more of the same"" effect of any sequel is about the only bad thing I can say about this neat thriller.",The Bourne Supremacy
190,blacklist-1,A far superior sequel that hugely surpasses it's predecessor,8,27 December 2009,"Naturally when the sequel to the disappointing Bourne Identity The Bourne Supremacy came out. I wasn't interested in seeing it at the cinema but five years later my dad who is a big fan of the films persuaded me to sit down with him one afternoon to watch the sequel. I was bored at the time and didn't have anything else to do so I thought how bad could it be.Well guess what it wasn't and I wasted five years of when I could have watched it. This was a terrific sequel and picks up where the first one left off with Bourne wanting to discover more about his past and about Treadstone, cue comes the CIA coming after him. All the old characters return mostly like Brian Cox and Joan Allen who are excellent in there roles.Karl Urban with a surprisingly good Russian accent is the assassin in this one and makes a fearsome adversary. Franke Potente as Bourne's girlfriend returns briefly but unfortunately gets terminated at the beginning of the film so there's no more sequels for her.Two factors that make the sequel much better than it's predecessor is Matt Damon. His acting is much better in this and disarms the bad guys smoothly and though he may not have the aura of a menacing assassin, he is cool,efficient and professional.Another factor is the action there is much more in this one and is edited frenetically hand-held by director Paul Greengrass, but the camera is never so swinging that you can't see what's happening and as a result the action sequences create more excitement and give them authenticity with some amazing stunts attached.With more action the focus of the story is apparent but has been toned down and more simplified, which makes it more easy to follow and interesting. This movie has been made with a visual flair, almost like art with excellent acting and action which is expertly made.I'm glad I gave this second one a chance and that it is much improved on the first. I can't wait now to the third one.",The Bourne Supremacy
191,CrassActionHero,Excellent Follow-Up,8,9 February 2007,"The Bourne Supremacy (2004) Review: After the exciting first installment, we get Bourne again!(I know, that was silly) This is an even better movie than the first by far. I am beginning to care about spy movies again.The Bourne Supremacy starts with our hero one again trying to figure out who he is. The memories keep coming, but still the pieces don't fit. He is secluded to a small town out somewhere in Asia. Suddenly a new person arrives in town and Bourne suspects somethings wrong. He warned them if they come looking for him, it will be hell.The story here is far better than the first. We gain some more character development and more depth. Bourne will once again travel back to find out who ordered to find him and maybe try to get some answers about his past.What really works here is the action. It's just as fast as the first and more real. One fight in particular is awesome, tight, and feels real. The acting here is even better than the first. Damon shows a more darker side of Bourne. This is a more darker movie than the first.I must mention the car chase scene here is far better than the first-and that's saying something! This one here is not only awesome, but more real. Bourne gets hit at least four times during this chase! This chase scene is so awesome that-when it's over, the broken glass and spilled gasoline will be all over you! Intense is the word.Give kudos this time to Joan Allen. She is really great here.The Last Word: Fantastic! This is just awesome. If you liked the first, than get ready for a high-octane monster! This beats the first installment and is spinning circles around it! One of the best sequels to date! Highly recommended!",The Bourne Supremacy
192,arthera09,Meh,6,7 April 2007,"Once again not a horrible film, but nothing special. The major complaint I had for the first Bourne movie was not felt here so it did not feel like a rushed book adaptation. The movie was not faster paced, but the story itself felt more contrived and like there was nothing special going on or nothing to set it apart from any other film like that. This movie also lacked Chris Cooper whom I enjoy very much. I did enjoy Joan Allen very much, but there was no real stand out acting. The action was typical, but the scene where he was scaling the wall was well done. I think I enjoyed the scene when he takes Nikki and avoids being followed. I don't know where the next movie is going to go, but in all honesty I barely care. Oh yeah it was also pretty funny when Matt Damon's character cried when his wife died. I do like Karl Urban, but he did not really get a chance to be bad ass. The end where Brian Cox was the insider was not surprising and felt forced. Overall not a good movie, but not horrible. It was find for killing a few hours over spring break.",The Bourne Supremacy
193,oshram-3,Even better than the first one,9,7 August 2004,"I gave 2002's Bourne Identity a pleasant but not glowing review, but I have to admit after several viewings on DVD that the first film grew on me. I've already seen the second one twice, but I had to see it a second time to review it as my first viewing was spent amongst rowdy and ill-behaved teenaged louts more interested in their potential rutting than the taut story unfolding before them on the screen.Matt Damon returns as the eponymous spy, now retired and trying to live his life in seclusion with his love Marie (Franka Potente). Unfortunately, a Russian hit man (Karl Urban) shows up from nowhere and disrupts that life, and the game, as in the first one, is afoot.I can't say much about the plot because there are a few wonderful twists in it that you absolutely wouldn't expect, and I don't want to give anything away. This movie fooled me incredibly on one plot twist, probably more completely than I have been fooled or misled in quite some time. But Supremacy is like that  just when you think you have it figured out, it turns around on you.I think this is actually a better film than the first one  tighter, leaner, and more suspenseful. Though Bourne is still plagued by amnesia, he's slightly more together and his newfound confidence and drive make him even more formidable. What also helps to elevate this movie is not just a better performance by Damon, but by sharp, strong turns across the board. Joan Allen is excellent as his semi-nemesis Pamela Landy; Allen gives us just the right combination of steel and level-headed planning, and she's a worthy foil for Bourne. Though her part is small, Julia Stiles is once again superb as Nikki, and Brian Cox  whom I'm really starting to like  is much more convincing and intriguing as Ward Abbott. Franka Potente, while not one of my favorites, nonetheless is able to once again imbue Marie with a warmth and humanity that makes it obvious why Bourne is drawn to her. And an actor whom I've liked for quite a while, Karl Urban, gives a great and creepy performance as the Russian Hit Man. Another actor I've long liked, Marton Csokas, has a small role as another Treadstone assassin, but he's wonderful.The action is blindingly fast and tight; fight scenes are like explosions of conflict. Bourne the character is crafty and subtle, and you can easily believe that he's giving the agency a run for its money. The chase scenes are all spectacularly well thought out, very clever and suspenseful. There are very few films, especially in the suspense genre, where the action takes a supporting role to character, but as well done as the action is here, that's exactly what it does. Director Paul Greengrass imbues the film with a great deal of well-used atmosphere. Landy's team's anxiety when Bourne kidnaps Nikki is palpable, leaping off the screen at you; Bourne's meeting with a fellow Treadstone agent is almost soothing, like the man himself, until things go south, and quickly; and the whole movie, set in winter, gives us a cold backdrop against the heat of the plot. The snow on the ground and the dead trees are subtle but effective reminders of Bourne's isolation, and the movie's mood helps propel the story as well.Damon here is a cut above. Not only does he perfectly portray Bourne's confusion, but he always manages to convey a sense of humanity through his almost super-human assassin. One scene toward the end, where Bourne makes a confession to a young woman, is simply excellent. But everyone is good here, sharp, quick, focused; the whole film is simply tight and well-balanced, well-played, and it moves so quickly it almost feels like it's over too soon despite being nearly two hours long.Bourne Supremacy is a very strong film, one of the best of the summer and the year. It fooled me more then once, which VERY few movies do, and it held my attention completely throughout twice  again, which very few movies do. There's an old saying about going to the well once too often, but I would not be unhappy to see another Bourne film. Though Jason develops in this movie, there are many places you could take this character, and I feel like we've really just started to scratch the surface. Don't wait until this is out for rental; see it in the theaters now, while you still can. It's certainly the most suspenseful movie of the summer, and one of the best crafted. They really don't get too much better than this.",The Bourne Supremacy
194,Tehmeh,Why Greengrass why? What's wrong with you?,6,13 September 2013,"I just watched and reviewed ""Bourne identity"" after updating my DVDs to blu-ray format, and I started watching this right after that. I'm on my second break and I'm not even halfway through with the film. Not to worry, I still remember the movie from my previous viewings.Almost everything that made ""Bourne identity"" good is now...worse or just plain awful. No character-centric plot. Not enough breathers. Somewhat shallow. Terrible camera work. Cast is still good and the story itself is decent, and as a story alone this isn't that bad - but as a movie this is awful to watch. So let's get into the major letdown that is the camera work, editing and the overall visual style and quality Paul Greengrass brought into this movie.The camera is always a) shaking b) too close c) zooming in the middle of shaking and being already too close to begin with. No, this doesn't just happen when there's an action scene - which would still be annoying - but it happens all the time. Needless zooming, panning, closeups one after another, endless amount of quick cuts and all of this happens through that certain filter that makes everything look green. My eyes are strained. My eyes hurt. I don't want movies to assault my body. This isn't a 10-hour long movie. I shouldn't have to take several breaks to survive this film..Not only that, but because this movie isn't focused on Jason Bourne as much as it's focused on its CIA conspiracy plot, the viewer (me) has to concentrate more. Especially when there are no breathers like in the first one, you need to keep your focus up. That's very, VERY hard to do when the camera is raping your eyes. In a way, the movie is saying ""pay attention!"" and kicking you in the face at the same time. Good job, idiots.One could argue that there is more personality, more expression and immersion in this kind of approach to shooting a movie. In this case, I call bullshit. I'm not saying you can't shoot a movie well with hand-held cameras, strange editing and weird colors. I'm only saying that Greengrass shot these movies with an overly aggressive ""style over substance"" mentality, when even the substance couldn't live up to the previous movie. I'm very disappointed he was the one who directed these Bourne sequels. It's not lazy film-making, it's just plain annoying film-making. What an awful decision to shoot a movie like this. I could deal with the fact that I can't see what's happening when there's an action scene (which would still be annoying) if it didn't strain my eyes to the point where I can't concentrate on the next non-action scene (which itself is shot in a same manner). I gave this a very generous 6/10 because of the cast and overall story (Gilroy's script, as usual). Greengrass can handle drama and put the script on the screen, but he shouldn't be let near a camera. As a story, this would've deserved much more than this insufferable execution. No, it's not a particularly engaging story and probably has nothing to do with the books, but it makes a decent film in itself. In short: this movie is better than how it's made. I understand there are people who can handle Greengrass' style, and I'm glad for them. They achieved something my eyes could not physically do. I couldn't help it, it wasn't in my power. I also understand people who can't watch this and give it a 1/10. It's just pure frustration. Who wouldn't get frustrated when a movie is trying anything in its power to make you not watch it? If you compare this to Kubrick's camera-work, you will explode.",The Bourne Supremacy
195,Barky44,So much better than Bond,9,5 August 2004,"The Bourne Supremacy tells the continuing saga of amnesiac spy Jason Bourne (Matt Damon). A highly-trained assassin, Bourne snapped several years ago (as told in the film The Bourne Identity). Since then, he has lived a peaceful life with his girlfriend (the beautiful Franka Potente), away from the CIA and the world of espionage. Until, that is, someone comes after him...The Bourne Supremacy is a fast-paced, action-packed yet (almost) believable espionage thriller. Damon excels as Bourne, the character not has stoic determination but an emotional core filled with the terrors of his past. This character is so much better than the one-dimensional James Bond ever was: he's human, grim, deep, sad yet dangerous.This film is so much better than any of the Bond films in terms of human drama. Sure, there are no fabulous weapons, there is no endless stream of shaggadelic babes, there are no cars that turn into para-sailers. But there are the worldly locales, the incredible car chases, the sudden twists, the dangerous assassins (Karl Urban), the double-crossing inside operatives (the omnipresent Brian Cox), and the smart Deputy Director who has to figure it all out (the incredible Joan Allen). And all of it told in under two hours, the perfect length for a film of this type.I have only two beefs about this film. The director overuses herky-jerky, highly edited photography that is distracting (especially during a fight scene between Damon and a fellow CIA assassin, so hard to watch it may be seizure-inducing) and so over-used in today's cinema it's become a parody. Then there is this highly unbelievable, indestructible Russian-made taxicab tougher than the Humvees used by the Marines Corps. The only comic moments in this film involved this cab careening off SUVs and barriers yet still outrunning cop cars.These are minor quibbles compared to the rest of the film. 9 out of 10.",The Bourne Supremacy
196,schroeder-gustavo,Damn Shaky Cam,5,27 July 2015,"The Bourne Supremacy is the second installment in the franchise. It has Matt Damon return as Jason Bourne, but it has a new director: Paul Greengrass. And boy does he love his shaky cam. Too bad I hate it.The movie suffers from the very same things that affected the Bourne Identity, which I mentioned in my Bourne Identity review. I talked about the uneven pace, the movie sometimes being too slow, then too fast and it not packing a mean punch. This movie suffers from all that and more! First, this is supposed to be an action movie, right? Then why is there hardly any action? This entry focuses a lot more on dialogue and drama than action and it just doesn't work. Also, really there are no likable characters except for Bourne himself. Especially Joan Allen's character is annoying as hell. The performance is good, but the character just sucks and you want her dead all the time.The worst mistake this movie makes is the overuse of the shaky cam, which when used well (which rarely happens, by the way) can be effective. But it's not the case in this movie, it just makes it way too hard for the viewer to experience the little action there is properly.The plot is convoluted, way too many things happen, but none that really matters and the movie isn't a complete disaster thanks to Damon's performance and a few cool scenes. The Bourne Supremacy disappoints, to say the least.",The Bourne Supremacy
197,Pavel-8,"Solid, but not as good as the original.",7,23 July 2004,"**Minor Spoilers Ahead!**""The Bourne Supremacy ""picks up about two years after the original ended. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and his girl Marie (Franka Potente) now reside in India, attempting to hide from the world of espionage. Of course that world finds them, yanking Bourne back into action, where he encounters a web of murder and money that forces him to confront semi-suppressed memories of his past missions. ""Identity"" worked marvelously in part because it placed the audience firmly in the proverbial shoes of first Bourne, then also Marie, allowing everyone to learn simultaneously. In lieu of the aforementioned method, ""Supremacy"" relies more on emotional connection. With bookend sequences that generate sympathy, the movie emphasizes Bourne's humanity more than its predecessor, which permits more connection with the characters, although not necessarily more involvement in the story. The smaller role of the aforementioned technique renders ""Supremacy"" a more traditional action movie, and a vengance flick to be precise. As he unravels the truth and seeks revenge on those who took from him, Bourne is both hunter and hunted, confronting semi-suppressed memories of past missions along the way.
All pertinent characters who were alive at the conclusion of Identity return here, played by the same actors. Damon is again quite good, adding a sense of weariness to Bourne, while continuing to carry him properly for one with such training. Potente is not as alluring as a blonde, but still glows as the beauty and sole friend for whom Bourne fights. The primary new face is Joan Allen as a task force chief who investigates Bourne's involvement in a homicide robbery. With her sharp features and all-business attitude, she steps confidently and capably into a part that often clashes with Brian Cox's fatigued but industrious government official. Julia Stiles returns in a similarly minor role, and Karl Urban (Eomer in ""LOTR"") rounds out the familiar faces as a cold-hearted and stone-faced Russian assassin. The parts add up to an again effective ensemble cast that is unfortunately under-utilized. In place of the compelling acting of ""Identity"" is a relative over-reliance on action. Director Paul Greengrass replaces Doug Liman at the helm, and perhaps since this is his first major motion picture, ""Supremacy"" is a little too shaky, both figuratively and literally. Greengrass doesn't possess as sure a hand as Liman (who produced the sequel), as evidenced by the movie's lesser emanation of confidence. The first film, headed by the interaction of Damon and Potente, drove forward steadily throughout. With their shared screen time limited, this movie slows occasionally, despite an expanded set of action scenes. The preponderance of such sequences, which should provide meaningful contrast to the valuable intimate moments, instead add to the cliches, producing a more traditional picture that doesn't flounder, but doesn't excel either. Additionally, the cinematography of the returning Oliver Wood and the editing of Richard Pearson & Christopher Rouse are slightly off-kilter, proving that less is more and that Aristotle's Golden Mean still reigns. The trio again uses what was so enjoyable in Identity, moving and handheld shots and nervous editing that simulate Bourne's mental state. But they overuse the techniques, apparently not knowing that how much is as important as what. The jumpiness is so prevalent that the hand-to-hand combat sequences in particular are occasionally hard to follow, and that in turn disrupts the flow enough to be distracting. Bottom Line: Despite (or perhaps because of) a more complicated story, the final product is a movie not as crisp or character-driven as the original. Thanks to a very good cast, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is still worth a viewing, meriting 7 of 10.",The Bourne Supremacy
198,destinylives52,As Good As The First One,8,21 August 2016,"Matt Damon returns for the second of the ""Bourne"" movies in ""The Bourne Supremacy."" Living in India with his girlfriend (played by Franka Potente), Damon's worst fears comes true when he is pursued by a secret agent (Karl Urban). Believing it is the CIA out to kill him, Damon takes the fight to them, unaware that Urban works for a rich, Russian businessman who wants Damon dead to tie up loose ends that began in the first movie. Complicating matters is that Urban has framed Damon for the deaths of a few CIA agents. With two groups out to kill him, Damon not only has to fight to stay alive, he has to figure out why he is being targeted for termination and by who. Although ""Supremacy"" has a new director, the feel of the first movie carries over to this one — in other words, if you liked ""Identity,"" you will like ""Supremacy."" Fast pacing, frenetic action, a likable hero, and a new revelation of Damon's past all lead to a very entertaining movie. My most memorable, movie moment of ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is the scene when Damon fights another Treadstone agent.

199,caseynicholson,Perhaps the Best Film of the Franchise,9,15 August 2016,"I'm making my way back through the ""Bourne"" movies so I can go see ""Jason Bourne"" which is in theaters now. Last night I watched ""The Bourne Supremacy"". While it's been a while since I've seen ""Ultimatum"", I think ""Supremacy"" may be the best film in the franchise series.There's quite a bit to like about this movie. In it we find that Jason Bourne is still struggling with amnesia in the wake of the events of ""The Bourne Identity"". As the film opens we find that he's making a life for himself far away from the eyes of the CIA, only to be framed by a foreign body such that he winds up on the run from the US government once more. The plot revolves around his attempt to clear his name and bring those responsible for the setup to justice.Unlike the first movie, this film is more re-watchable in that whereas once you've seen the original film you pretty much know where it's going, the ""Supremacy"" is a new chapter that stays fresh even on multiple views. In other words, it's hard to forget the gist of the first movie's plot and its eventual outcome--but the ""Supremacy"" takes the basic concept of the franchise and crafts a tale that could have been told as any chapter in the series. If you've not seen it in a few years, you'll likely find yourself just as engrossed in it upon a second viewing as you were the first go around.I also find that this film just simply has the best plot of the series, and has a story that keeps you on the edge of your seat. New characters are introduced that make the film fun and exciting, and by the end of the show you feel like you've got your money's worth.That said, I've given this movie 9/10 stars. I stop short of the perfect 10/10 simply because this is a sequel that a person might be a bit lost on without having seen the first movie. That, and while it's fantastic, it's fantastic in a way that just seems to fall a teensy bit short of iconic in the way that a perfect 10 might. Still a superb movie, though. Extremely well done.",The Bourne Supremacy

This film is almost a carbon copy of the first. You have the car chases, the same assembled cast, the discover of Bourne's past. But what the first film executed in terms of action and story, Supremacy doubles it.Why should you watch this film? Simple. If you didn't enjoy film number one, then don't waste your cash. However, if you did enjoy it, even if you didn't highly rate it, then Supremacy is a must see. If you haven't seen the first then it no big deal.instead of walking round europe , dressed up like a college student, Bourne Is always one step ahead of the game.

The energy and excitement of Matt Damon's performance is unsurpassed.  One becomes exhausted by the time the film reaches a climax. There is no secret that this movie is a great success.  The numbers alone attest to that.  The acting is solid.  The photography is fluid.  The musical score is compatible with the pace.  After the ""Bourne Identity"" was released, one could not wait for the sequel to arrive.  It is now here and it is a smashing success.

Franke Potenta was a bad choice; an unknown who is unattractive and a poor actor was one. Chris Cooper was another; a dreadfully inept actor who couldn't play himself in his own life story.Casting mistakes can ruin a production. Supremacy has a really obvious casting mistake : Joan Allen. Joan is unattractive enough to be a politician instead of an actor, and she employs the same affect in every film.

206,Lupercali,Very weak. A major disappointment,3,7 February 2005,"I'm amazed that this film rates so well here. The re-make of 'The Bourne Identity' (which I actually only watched for the first time two days before this movie) was a decent thriller. This was a hopelessly weak, half-hearted, over-stylised and predictable bore of a movie.The signs were there early on, when Jason reacts to a traumatic event with barely any emotion (nor at any time later in the movie). Events happen rapidly and confusingly, a blonde woman who talks very quickly is assigned to the case by the CIA, Bourne runs about the place using different passports, there are car chases. There is more editing in this film than in an Oliver Stone film on picture search. Honestly, there are fight sequences in which the shot changes so fast, so often, that you can't even work out who is hitting who. I actually sat down at one action sequence in the film and tried to time a camera shot that lasted for more than a second, and failed. This pointless stylisation is just really irritating and makes things difficult to follow.More importantly though the movie just has no feeling. You can understand why Bourne would be motivated to behave the way he does, but he doesn't actually seem to be experiencing any such feelings, except the usual confusion and determined anger left over from the first film.Honestly I just thought this was a weak, weak film. It didn't engage me emotionally, there was too much frivolous editing, the characters and plot were predictable, despite the best efforts of the director to render the plot hard to follow. It was just very obviously a case of ""Well the first film made a lot of money, we'll have to make a sequel."" If the ratings here are any judge, I suppose they'll have to make another one, but I can tell you now I'll be staying away from that.",The Bourne Supremacy
207,mattrochman,"Big good points, big bad points",5,7 May 2010,"I found this one of the most difficult films to review on IMDb and I have already reviewed identity and ultimatum, so it doesn't surprise me that I reviewed this last.After watching it the first time, I felt like I had not made up my mind about this film. Did I enjoy it? Well best to say that I enjoyed the plot generally and thought the acting was engaging. But unfortunately, the frantic hand-held camera work introduced with the new director in this film really cost it a lot of stars in my rating. In fact, it virtually spoiled the film.The fight he has with the last remaining treadstone agent in Munich was built up really well and started well, but as the fight went on, I completely lost track of who was doing what, not to mention that the way bourne ends up disposing of this adversary was weak and hardly worthy of the build up.The first 30 minutes and the introduction of Pam Landy, along with the Berlin aspect of the story, was well done, but once we went to Moscow, the film somehow lost its vigor and resorted back to the self-indulgent hand-held annoying camera work and a rather anti-climactic car chase.In the hands of another director, I think this film could have been a real winner. But its big strong points, including a solid follow-on plot that so many other sequels lack, were outweighed by experimental directing and camera work, leaving it as nothing more than a middle of the road film, hence 5 stars out of 10.In the end, identity remained the best of the lot, but that may not have been the case if Liman had directed both sequels.",The Bourne Supremacy
208,Asteri-Atypical,OK - but NOT as good as the original,5,29 July 2004,"This movie had its features, but, as with many other sequels, it does NOT measure up to the original.I don't know why there was a new director. Liman had the passion to pursue Ludlum to secure the rights and bring the movie to life. He did a superior job to Greengrass in Supremacy.The original had a much more ""European feel"" to it. While this installment was set in Europe, you didn't feel like you were THERE as much. Maybe as a tourist on a brief visit. You didn't feel like you were living there, as in Identity.It's a shame we didn't see more of Franka. She was instrumental in setting the 'feel' of the first movie. Also, what happens with her (which I will not get into to avoid spoilers) makes little sense.There was more intrigue in the original. This was much more an action-based film. The action was good, however.Lastly, I will make note of the camermanship. How many dopio espressos had these camera operators HAD before showing up at work? While Liman explored ""hand-cam style steadycam use"", in this version, it looks like the camera operators had some kind of neurological disorder! This was made worse by frequent freehand pans and frequent cuts. Few shots in this movie lasted more than a couple seconds before a cut to a different view (usually in the middle of a pan or zoom) was made. While this was probably made to leave the viewer somewhat off-balance, it was overdone and NOT a good technique like in the original movie.All in all, it's worth seeing. It's just a shame that the quality of the original couldn't have been preserved. Liman, where were you?!?",The Bourne Supremacy

I knew the basics of the series, and the second film reintroduces the key plot information succintly. The plot of The Bourne Supremacy is deceptively simple, although it appears muddled at times during the film.  I'm told that the plot of the movie has little relation to Robert Ludlum's book of the same name, but that doesn't matter to me as I have not read the book. Matt Damon is quite effective as Jason Bourne/David Webb, and his low key portrayal sets him apart from flashier spies.  The other key performances are from Brian Cox and Joan Allen, both of whom are very good.  Julia Stiles has a small role as well, although I'm ambivalent about her as an actress. My main complaint relates to director Paul Greenglass, whose hyperkinetic editing combines with the heavy use of handheld cameras to make the film jarringly difficult to watch at times.",The Bourne Supremacy

211,phiggins,Top notch. Again.,9,25 August 2004,"SPOILER WARNING To make one good movie out of a Robert Ludlum potboiler may be considered a fluke. To make two good movies out of Robert Ludlum potboilers may be cause for concern. I know they say that the worst books often make the best movies, but this is ridiculous. The books weren't THAT bad. So why are the movies so good? The first in the sequence, ""The Bourne Identity"" was a very pleasant surprise in a year of tedious blockbusters and over-hyped garbage. And now we have the second movie, ""The Bourne Supremacy"". Where the first eschewed scenes in which people said, ""I want this guy taken DOWN"", the second at times veers dangerously close to cliché, but manages to avoid it by filling the screen with fine performers, relentlessly crunchy action and realistically grotty locations. Yes, Joan Allen's CIA executive overdoes it a tad, but there's always Brian Cox to calm things down again - ""with the greatest respect, Pam, I think you're working a little bit beyond your pay scale"", or words to that effect. It's a shame he blows his brains out in this one, as that leaves a Brian-Cox-shaped gap in the third one, but I'm sure the film-makers will think of something. Certainly Jason Bourne manages to think of everything. From death by toaster-and-magazine to how to get a CIA executive's room number, he has it covered. He goes from downcast taciturnity to explosive violence in the blink of an eye. As in the first movie there are ice-cold confrontations and nerve-shredding chases and through the middle of it all, there goes Matt Damon, the perfect actor for this kind of film. Neither too showy nor too distant, he fits this role so well you can imagine him playing it for many years to come. It's like a synthesis of his brainy arrogance in ""Good Will Hunting"" and his icy charm in ""Ripley"". Again, it helps that he is surrounded by talented and believable actors playing all the CIA drones and Russian scumbags. The action sequences are all uniformly superb. The fight in the German minimalist's flat is breath-taking and goes from nervous banter to wild violence, ending with a tangle of bodies that looks disturbingly authentic. The Moscow car chase, meanwhile, has to be seen to be believed. The best of its kind since ""Ronin"", it has no gimmicks or tricks up its sleeve beyond speed, crashes, more speed, and more crashes. That it takes place at the end of a film which has already given us a fine car chase at the beginning, only adds to the sense of an embarrassment of riches. That early car chase, by the way, is very well handled. The shots of Bourne's girl-friend with her hands on the dashboard to steady herself provide a sense of genuine danger. They really do look as if they are driving far too fast down those Indian back streets. It's not hard to see where this series is going - next he has to trace his own life by heading back to Nixon, Missouri, I suppose. No doubt there will be people trying to stop him, for one reason or another. What is hard to imagine is that the third film will be as good as this one. And yet this one was as good as the first, so anything's possible.",The Bourne Supremacy
212,Adorable,"Second Hand, Runs Well",7,10 September 2004,"--POTENTIAL SPOILER--Unearthing decent spy movies in this post-cold war epoch often resembles a wild goose chase, with true gems few and far between. The Bourne franchise came to us back in 2002, vying for attention against the tepid likes of a re-incarnated Jack Ryan in The Sum of All Fears. Starring Matt Damon, Bourne won hands down with its enjoyable romp of cross-European, high-tech escapades. Combining a reasonably gripping story with sufficient quotas of CGI-free excitement, The Bourne Identity filled a long deserted niche for many film buffs, and while it didn't exactly conjure the good old KGB vs Everybody days, it nonetheless heralded a comeback for previously prominent big screen values.In the first Bourne foray, Damon played super agent Jason Bourne, suffering from amnesia and struggling to find out who the hell operated him in the first place. Amid several well-crafted action segments and car chases, the movie depicted Bourne's stand against a shadowy covert conspiracy bent on keeping hidden from prying eyes and vindictive ex-operatives with too much time and gadgets on their hands. The sequel begins more or less where the first chapter left off. A liberated Bourne and his prequel-originated love interest Marie (Franke Potente) elope to exotic Goa beaches in India, eking out a bucolic existence there away from hapless intelligence agencies and brainwashed assassins.But idyllic conditions like those were never meant to last, and Bourne's infamy soon catches up with him, at Marie's grisly expense. Turns out a new secret agenda has risen to the fore, threatening to entangle our reluctant master spy. A p***ed off Bourne therefore ventures to locate those responsible for Marie buying the farm, as well as clear his own name.While just as thrilling as its senior, The Bourne Supremacy reveals a major flaw even in the moniker given it: Matt Damon's indefatigable protagonist simply has too many moves, abilities, and lives for his own good. Believability aside, at some point the agent's uncanny expertise begins to grate, not gelling at all with his supposed cluelessness and so-called desperate situation. Would you be desperate if you had a seemingly endless supply of cash of every denomination, nine passports, and ready made weapons that materialize out of thin air? To fluff up Supremacy's plot and distinguish it from Identity's, the newer flick features increased complexity and multiple conflicts in need of resolution, thus paving the way for additional episodes, should the need be felt. Bourne presently faces ghosts harking back to his former employers, Treadstone, plus a few new ones courtesy of that by-now obligatory action movie stalwart, the Russian mafia. Ever-menacing Brian Cox (The Ring, X2, Troy) returns as a suspiciously uncooperative would-be ally, tagging along for the ride while CIA chief Landry (Joan Allen) tries to organize a legitimate search for the missing renegade professional. Karl Urban (Chronicles of Riddick, Lord of the Rings) adds intimidation via a calculating Russian hit-man, and Julia Stiles contributes selected pouty facial expressions, minimally augmenting Supremacy's lineage and ties to its cinematic forebear. But all of these characters can't mask the movie's slightly more-of-the-same feel. Despite an astonishingly accomplished car chase through Moscow in a puzzlingly sturdy old taxi, impressive shots of Berlin and pervasively consistent levels of suspense, overall impressions lead us to conclude Supremacy fails to surpass the first outing, resulting in superfluous baggage of the infuriatingly addictive variety. Expectations for whatever comes next in the action series, presumably Ludlum's Bourne Ultimatum, should be kept to moderate thresholds of feasibility. Do not anticipate something bombastic nor marvelously ground-breaking, but certainly look forward to more capable antics from the indestructible Damon and his box office panache.Rating: * * *",The Bourne Supremacy
213,CurtMan@LVCM.com,"Unconventional, Immensely Dizzying Action Flick",10,23 September 2004,"""The Bourne Supremacy"" is a super-charged, nonstop thrill ride, featuring the all-too-familiar ""wronged man with a short fuse"", in this case an amnesiac former CIA agent, being beleaguered and hunted by deadly assassins. The film is comprised of fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping, gritty action sequences, which seem starkly unconventional, if immensely dizzying and disjointed, to one following everything that is happening. This is decent action entertainment which could have been executed much more effectively if the editing technique had been more focused and general, rather than hurried and fragmented. There are many instances in the film where this disjointed editing technique ""spoils the ride"" and leaves us desperate for the train to come to a halt. Talk about an expedited and confusing execution from your standard ""getaway chase"" actioner. Damon is totally low-key, serving as merely a subject for the rage, a target for the action: we are hardly concerned about what happens to him, but rather, what happens to them, the aggressors who seem to have awakened a sleeping giant in Bourne. Other characters are insignificant, I don't care what their involvement in the plot, because with a premise such as this, the audience is merely concerned with ""who's next on (Bourne's) list"", rather than, ""Oh, no, not that guy"", and everyone is subservient to the relentless action. There are many pleasant elements here, such as the heart-pounding, adrenaline-pumping music which provides some coherence to the confusing action design, but the gritty, fragmented direction is cloying and sometimes intolerable for the action to be seriously engaging or satisfying. Otherwise, this film could have been entirely entertaining, yet as it is executed, ""Supremacy"" is notes shy of worthy recommendation. **1/2 out of ****",The Bourne Supremacy

The halo of mystery is always with us and the screeching manner of amnesia recalls makes you squint same as you heard that nail-to-glass sound; may even cause an epileptic seizure if watched mindfully.Nevertheless, after a head-banging push our sledge begins to move and gain a substantial speed. The plot would have been interesting if it wasn't so dumb: government agencies are shown as a bunch of naïve children with some fancy gadgets. Putting aside lousy reasoning we are left with the rush of a chase on every possible corner that doesn't seem to overdose the viewer. Although from time to time it felt dizzy and I couldn't understand what's happening, the adrenaline was pumping, so the task was complete.Matt Damon continues to show that this character was created for him: showing no robotlike behavior but a set of skills that never really seems to run out (just look at this Russian here). Love the multiple change of settings in the movies: gives you an impression of a global scale operations that increase the value of Bourne in your eyes.Bumping into the end credits I had mixed feelings: on one hand, it got better that the first part in some ways, but I believe it can do better.

     Damon is believable as a desperate, yet ruthless expert. A  killer who is rightly feared for his skills and seen as a threat. I also liked the upper level office politics within Langley. It's nice to show that these operatives are acting according to a policy sent down from above.   
The editing was good with lots of  quick cuts and hand-held/steadicam work was compelling. I always love a good fight scene and this film has one with an explosive conclusion.

You know his idyllic life on a remote island will be blown from the first.How this all is resolved takes the viewer on a non-stop chase through various foreign countries. Good flick!",The Bourne Supremacy
219,blackwidowis7cool,Nowhere near as good as the original,7,29 August 2019,"Honestly, while I enjoyed this movie because it's Bourne, it actually felt like an excuse to bring Bourne back. I know there are several books, but the ending to the original felt like that's where they should have left it.
The movie's good, and I think there may be some small contradictions to the first, I think (could be wrong, though). The acting is great - Damon is excellent, as per usual. Some surprising twists and turns.
A completely unnecessary movie sequel that I more or less enjoyed.",The Bourne Supremacy
220,AmyJenson1995,As good as the first movie,9,19 February 2017,"After Bourne Identity, I was expecting that sequel to be as good and I'm not deceived. It has achieved to make me definitely love the saga.Jason Bourne is back but against his wishes. When the woman he loves got killed by a CIA assassin, he decides to go after them just like he promised at the end of the first movie.As expected, Bourne Supremacy is a bit darker than the first opus. We are introduced to new characters like Pamela Landy, a CIA station chief who is in charge of an operation related to the first mission accomplished by Bourne. When this op fails with the death of two men and Jason's fingerprints are found on the scene, she is tasked with taking him down. That's the beginning of a long series of twists which uncovers a much larger conspiracy within the CIA.Thankfully what makes the first movie so great, the thrilling action, is still there and so masterfully filmed once again. I'm truly amazed by its choreography which is perfectly timed and efficient. Knowing that Matt Damon was making his own stunts, it's truly impressive. I can't even imagine how much time he trained to reach that level of perfection.Keep it comin'!",The Bourne Supremacy
221,JesNollie,"Good, but not as good as it's prequel",7,27 July 2004,"This was a good movie, but not as good as The Bourne Identity.  The story was good, though predictable, and the acting was good, but there was a lot of really bad camera work.  The fight scenes and car chases were tedious and nearly unwatchable, and in this type of film those things are very important. I have heard that they intend to continue the Bourne series with at least one more film.  Hopefully they will return to the director of the first, or at least one of the many directors who can film a watchable action scene. The film is definitely worth seeing, but I must admit that I was glad I paid a matinee price.",The Bourne Supremacy
222,aeo,Great movie!,10,29 July 2004,"Usually, the sequel to a movie is not as good as the original but in this case, the sequel is better than the original.  I remember reading Robert Ludlum's novels on the character Jason Bourne and being thoroughly entertained by it.  When I heard this character was to be made into a movie, I was a little wary because movie adaptation of a book is usually not well done and after seeing the first movie, I felt my fears were justified.  When I heard a second Bourne movie was going to be made, my wariness turned to anger.  I felt the first movie was not true to the novel and Matt Damon was the wrong actor to be portraying Bourne.  However, I am a masochist so I did go see the second Bourne movie and I am glad that I did.The writing was better than the first movie and I had gotten used to Matt Damon's face as Bourne that I was not annoyed by his presence on the screen at all.  The action was well done although a bit over the top in certain scenes but it did not hamper the realistic feeling for the story.*******POSSIBLE SPOILERS**********************The story takes place after the first Bourne movie where he tries to leave his past as being an assassin for the CIA behind him and try to live a normal life with his girlfriend in India.  But that is not to be when an assassin kills his woman instead of him, and that leads him on a rampage across Europe to find the reason why the CIA, he erroneously believes, is still after him even though he explicitly told his CIA contacts in the first Bourne movie, that he wanted no more part of the spy business. 
In his investigation, he finds that he is being framed as a killer of two CIA operatives who were on a mission to retrieve information regarding an important Russian citizen.  His quest for truth leads him to discover how the two CIA agents and his girlfriends death are all tied to a scheme planned by corrupted CIA and Russian officials.  Further, he begins to recall an assassination he once did which he begins to unravel is directly linked to the corrupted scheme.

223,starlit-sky,Supremely Entertaining 2nd Installment to The Bourne Identity,10,8 September 2010,"This is just as entertaining and awesome as the Bourne Identity, if not better. Our hero Jason is in India trying to stay off the radar of those who are after him but that doesn't seem to be possible. We learn more details about The project Treadstone and Bourne's past. In this movie, the Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) character comes to front and also Pamela Landy (Joan Allen).The car chase scenes (shot in the streets of Moscow, Russia) must be the best car chase scenes ever shot in the history of cinema. The Bourne Identity also had incredible high speed car scenes shot in France but Supremacy takes it to another level, a supreme level you might say. There are some parallel scenes from Bourne Identity the first movie (the fight scene inside the apartment and the chase scenes where Bourne escapes his pursuers). Despite the parallel scenes, this movie is still unique.The action scenes, chase scenes, the plot, the characters make this movie, like the Bourne Identity, superbly entertaining to watch. I highly recommend it. The entire Bourne Trilogy is probably the best spy thrillers we have seen in many years, maybe the best in the history of cinema.",The Bourne Supremacy
224,Blackace,Someone Take Me Off This Roller Coaster,7,29 July 2004,"The Bourne Supremacy is a decent movie that's really only tainted by the poor camera work and some missing additional action. I'm not going to get too involved with the story, since I'm sure someone else has already explained the plot. A short summary is that Jason Bourne is being framed for killing to agents in Berlin. The Secret Service is out to bring him in or terminate him. Jason has to travel all around the globe trying to track people down to prove his innocence. Even though there are some intense chase scenes throughout various international countries, what kills the beautiful action is the closeness of the camera. In every action scene, even the hand to hand combat, the camera is right on top of the actors. The fight between Jason and an old agent in his apartment is totally ruined because the camera is two feet away from them. At times it appears that the camera is in the fight as well, as he falls down and the camera bounces all over the place. Even the car chases, which usually show the action from close, medium and long distances, is constantly right next to the car. There are times when all you see is the front end and tire. Want to see good car chase camera work, watch ""Gone in 60secs."" Even check out the trailer for ""Taxi"" (starring Queen Latifah). That's how car chase scenes should be filmed.Besides this problem, the movie is pretty decent. Even though the plot is predictable, the end result isn't. All the actors do a great job in this film. Joan Allen is great as Pamela Landy and Matt Damon is perfect as the hard nosed take no prisoners Jason Bourne. I was looking forward to a bit more martial arts fighting, but it really didn't come.There is already talks of a third (and probably final) movie. Bourne Supremacy had a high opening of $51 million, which is nothing to sneeze at. Meanwhile Halley Barry's Catwoman only made $17 million. Is The Bourne Supremacy worth seeing. Sure, but sit way in the back, as sitting up close will make you dizzy.",The Bourne Supremacy
225,FilmFan777,Shaky camera almost ruins strong follow up to 'Bourne Identity',7,23 July 2004,"What really kept this film from becoming what it really could have, was the tiresome over-use of the, 'shaky camera' syndrome.I mean come on, it was like Katherine Hepburn shooting from atop a circus ball in a mudslide on a stormy day. (No disrespect for our beloved Hepburn) It has it's place however too much of a good thing can be bad and that's what happened here. It took away from many moments including, the fight scenes.      As in the first Bourne, the action was quick yet settled enough to let you absorb what was happening while keeping the effect. Here, two monkeys could have been flailing around and you wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Why the need for so much cover up instead of taking the effort to choreograph some smart and believable sparring? It was truly effective in the first Bourne and should have been kept along the original spirit. Yes we understand different Directors have their own niche so, I'm saying Greengrass and his niche wasn't as Bourne as Director Liman.     It was an interesting story and I believe writer Tony Gilroy did a good job, even humorous at times which played very well. Yet I would like to have seen a bit more that unpretentious and natural physical combat and clever side winding as in the first. Still, it was an interesting film, though it was done pretty well yet still fell short of my hopes.
     Damon was made for this and like roles and again an excellent character portrayal. Being a stud without trying to be, is just what this part needed and Matt does a great job at it. As far as I'm concerned, it's about time Damon finds another part of his stride. I hope he continues a while along this path.     All in all Damon and writer Gilroy were the best aspects of this film. Not quite enough to make it what it should have, but they did a good job in making up the best they could for Greengrass' minor mistake in vision, that made a very big impact.7/10",The Bourne Supremacy
226,randomStuff101,Far worse than Identity,5,6 February 2005,"This movie is nothing special. In fact it is rather bad, and I have little enthusiasm in writing much, except to say that I agree with others comments about the camera work being too shaky. Many scenes are ruined by this camera technique.An epileptic camera isn't original by any means. NYPD Blue anyone? In other words, yesterday's cheap TV effect... not cool. The same cinematographer worked on Identity under a better Director and did a fine job. He was obviously told by the Director of Supremacy to use this awful shaky camera effect.That scene where the house blows up and the men get thrown back - they cut 3 times during the explosion and the result was they lost the energy of a perfectly good explosion. Dreadful. The close up shot of this explosion on the DVD extra features was better than the one used in the final cut! Back to film school Mr. editor. There are many other poor editing/camera moments.The film falls down in other ways though. The acting is stale, the story is weaker than the first. Even the car chase scene through Moscow - heralded as some kind of great car chase feat - is not only ruined by the overly-confusing camera work (you can't see what's going on), but ends with a disappointing anti-climax.The ""crash-cam"" effect from within Bourne's car is very cool.... but this is an isolated moment of coolness.",The Bourne Supremacy
227,freewillyfan,The Bourne Supremacy,9,2 November 2019,The Bourne Supremacy is a great sequel to The Bourne Identity. Matt Damon is back and is great. The new characters are really good and add new depth to the franchise. The action I thought was great except for one fight were at times is was a little difficult to see what was going on. In my opinion this film is actually a little better then Identity. It is faster passed and has a great ending were Bourne confronts the daughter of two people he has killed and admits to doing it. That was very well done. Overall a very exciting and fast passed movie.9.0/10,The Bourne Supremacy
228,iwalrus,Slightly Better Than The First,8,19 April 2021,"A very good sequel to ""The Bourne Identity"" and is slightly better than the first.Would rate it 8.5A couple of good but unbelievable car chases thrown in.The worst part was losing Franka Potente's character early.Recommended.",The Bourne Supremacy
229,cleary-joshua,Matt Damon continues to be a great action hero...,9,28 May 2014,"One of the greatest challenges to overcome when producing a franchise is that, inevitably, people will change. Actors sometimes move on, and this can greatly change the vision and style of the franchise. Results can differ greatly: ""Terminator: Salvation"" proved that the franchise was nothing without Arnie, but ""The Dark Knight"" managed just as well with Maggie Gyllenhall as ""Batman Begins"" had with Katie Holmes. But what about directors? Alfonso Cuaron's taking over of the Harry Potter franchise, albeit briefly, took the series to an even better place after Chris Columbus' first two films. So how would ""The Bourne Supremacy"" cope without Doug Liman at the helm, and with Paul Greengrass instead? In short – very well indeed. Greengrass is now known, after ""United 93″ and ""Captain Phillips"", for his intimate, documentary-like style, which makes for great thrillers. And thankfully it carries off in this too, showcasing Matt Damon's abilities perfectly in numerous sequences.Matt Damon continues to be a great action hero and the matter of 'learning stuff while he does' is one of the things that continues to make this series so watchable. The film follows Jason Bourne's continual quest to find out who he is, while getting caught up in CIA operations and being framed for crimes he didn't commit. He's constantly on the run from CIA Deputy Director Pamela Landy, played superbly by Joan Allen, and their two phone conversations late in the film show a great dynamic between the two characters.This film plays more with the nature of Bourne's memory loss, and is very interesting visually when his memories start to come back to him. ""Supremacy""'s use of plot is extremely bold, especially in killing off an important main character extremely early on, but carries it off effectively. This device makes the rest of the movie more thrilling, because you now know that no character is truly safe, apart maybe from Bourne himself. The film's greatest strength, however, is its gripping action sequences, and this film has plenty of car chases and fight scenes to keep the audience happy. At times, the actual plot can be a bit muddled or confusing, but action is never too far around the corner, and is always worth waiting for.So here it is, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is a rare movie. It's a sequel that's better than its original, but despite the differences in aesthetic, it doesn't feel that far removed from ""Identity"", just a development on those ideas. The franchise's weakness continues to be its slightly muddled plot, but perhaps it only feels that way because we're so used to Hollywood spoon-feeding. It's a film that's definitely worth putting effort into, because the payoff is superb.",The Bourne Supremacy

231,Sanou_san,Unexpected!!!,10,30 October 2008,"I knew that a Bourne sequel would deserve its predecessor, and here it is! I knew how well the preceding Bourne movie had worked well, and this oneis indeed a pretty decent movieit is way more decent, it's spectacularly far better than the preceding one. This is so much unexpected indeed for most sequel-prone movies, where the crew behind usually lose their talent to infuse more creative layer for sequels, but this one is totally different! I never expect how well they manage to elevate the quality and standing of the movie. Bourne Supremacy continues with Jason Bourne, after quite sorting out things in his past in the first movie he come to live in peace with her girlfriend (whom he met throughout his retracing journey in Bourne Identity) Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente) in India. However some of those use to poison CIA by letting an ambushed operation of them, manage to let Jason Bourne's identity held responsible thus endangering his life (and his girlfriend as well) once again. The first few minutes of the movie was indeed a mix of thrill, resentment and lament, but when it continues so are our surprises continues as well.

This one is a lot stronger, and is a stand alone effort that does not require you even see the first film. There are some combat and car chase scenes that have kind of a jerky, piecemeal affect that makes them harder to follow than they should be, but that is the only weak spot in the whole film. I am still having trouble with Matt Damon as a deadly assassin but he is a heavyweight actor and his situation grabs you and holds you through to the last scene. Very good supporting work from Brian Cox and Joan Allen. I believe there was a trilogy of books by this author, and if so I can't wait for the next one.",The Bourne Supremacy

Haldheld photography like this - well, all I can say is that I've seen home movies made by ten year olds that were better filmed than this show.And let's not even think about getting into the issue of a movie having the title and character names from a popular novel, but bearing absolutely no resemblence to the novel.  Let's just not go there.Save your money on this one, folks.",The Bourne Supremacy
234,TimBoHannon,Somebody Give Greengrass a Steady Camera!,7,26 October 2008,"Minus one horrible production decision, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" would stand above its two peers as the best of the trilogy. The plot holds less relevance to the overall arc of Jason Bourne's life than the other two. It is also, by no small margin, the most complicated and involving of the three. Matt Damon gives his most successful performance. The pacing of the action brings a more even movement to the affair. Unfortunately, a *monstrous* misstep by director Paul Greengrass places ankle weights on ""Supremacy"" as it tries to run.Writer Tony Gilroy had to discard most of the plot from Robert Ludlum's novels. Real-life assassin and terrorist Carlos the Jackal, Bourne's main literary antagonist, was apprehended in 1994. He now lives in a French prison, rendering Ludlum's story lines useless. Its replacement for ""Supremacy"" deals with a leak in CIA money and the resulting cover-up.Two years after the events of ""The Bourne Identity,"" Jason Bourne (Damon) resides in India with his lady Marie (Franka Potente). After an assassin (Karl Urban) botches an attempt on his life, he assembles all his weapons and phony passports. His next destination is Germany where he seeks his only known contact from the now defunct Treadstone project.Meanwhile, turbulence abounds at the CIA. Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) prepares to receive documents naming the insider who embezzled 20 million CIA dollars. Both seller and buyer are murdered. Crime techs lift Bourne's fingerprint from the area, so Landy suspects that he may have come out of retirement to hide his involvement in the crime. The two investigate the same case from different ends, and what they unearth will surprise and distress them both.Chris Cooper played the villain in the first movie, and ""The Bourne Supremacy"" suffers from his absence. His successor initially appears to be oil billionaire Yuri Gretkov (Karel Roden). It is he who arranged the failed murder of Bourne. He only appears four times, and two of those scenes are quite short. Roden also lacks Cooper's panache. That leaves Karl Urban's killer, who is not intended to be a lively character and is also missing from the center section. Landy is Bourne's primary antagonist, but she is not a villain. As she tirelessly pursues Bourne, she never allows her mind to be locked into her first impressions. Like a good detective, her top priority is finding the truth.Damon provides compensation. His performance demands the greatest range between heavy sadness and provoking anger. The puzzlement that dominated his feelings in the first movie is gone. We see a far deadlier and single-minded Bourne. He twice bared his teeth in ""The Bourne Identity,"" but that was tame compared to what does here. His interrogation of the defenseless Nicky (an underrated Julia Stiles) introduces a previously unseen nastiness. Nicky's sobbing and pleas for mercy only escalate Bourne's behavior.At the end, he locates the daughter of a prior victim in order to give her the truth and offer an apology. We see him repeatedly blink back tears for a person he has never met. His voice cracks with grief over his past actions and the reality of seeing the destruction he wrought in her life. Damon plays this scene so well that Bourne's own emotions visibly respond to what he observes in the girl (touchingly played by Oksana Akinshina).Greengrass' method of shooting the film is a serious detriment. Unlike the movies before and after, the action is evenly spaced. It fits flawlessly with the overall story progression. It is here that Greengrass shakes the camera as if it is his favorite exercise. His earthquake cam jerks harder and faster with each successive scene. Even the still moments have some visual instability. A fight between Bourne and a former colleague (Marton Csokas) is probably the trilogy's best. That verdict is impossible to give because of the trembling cam. It feels like Greengrass is trying to let us see just enough to stimulate our appetites without producing the entire meal.If the bulk of the movie does not take this too far, the climactic car chase does. A number of crashes occur, and of course the epileptic cam pretends to be in them. A shaking world is different when the person is involved since our brain can make it all palatable. On a screen in front, however, it induces motion sickness. My friend had to close his eyes for much of the car chase. Somebody at the local theater vomited on opening night. Another friend thought of ""Cloverfield,"" which is supposed to look like amateur photography, when I described the convulsion cam. Instances like those make Greengrass look bad.Greengrass' poor judgment tempted me to withhold a recommendation after my first viewing. It was only until my jaded second that I was able to see all the great qualities this movie has to offer. The Huntington's-diseased cam is not as exasperating on the small screen, so home video is the way to go. If Universal ever re-releases it in theaters, stay away.",The Bourne Supremacy

We learn just a little bit more about Bourne this time around it and leaves you wanting more.

236,pninson,Wildly Overrated (spoilers),4,27 July 2004,"I'm a little surprised that reviewers are falling all over themselves to heap praise on this slick but trivial action flick. Sure, it isn't weighed down with moronic one-liners (i.e., "".... this!""). Matt Damon not only reinvents himself as an action star, but he seems to have created a new kind of action hero. He's not a musclebound engine of destruction; he combines vulnerability and sensitivity with tough-guy agility, and he's fun to watch.The rest of the cast is good, particularly an almost unrecognizable Joan Allen.However, the story is pretty thin. Plot points are telegraphed way in advance, and there's a routine quality to it that's all too familiar. Brian Cox must be getting tired of playing the heavy; this fine actor has done wonderful work in the past but there's little for him to do here except paint by the numbers. Ludlum's novel (an entirely different story), for all its faults, avoids the kind of stereotypical evil-boss-of-the-rogue-government agency that's become a tired staple of this kind of fiction.Where the film really fails though is in the worst excess of quick-cut editing I have seen so far. This is getting to be a real problem in movies.During the climactic car chase, it's almost impossible to follow the action (or to determine if there really is any). This is easily the blurriest, badly staged excuse for a car chase sequence I've ever seen. My friend, who generally likes almost any movie, remarked that it might be better on a small screen.I noticed this also in ""Chronicles of Riddick"", where the fight scenes were quick-edited to the point of incomprehensibility. You know Vin Diesel is going to win all his fights, but how about some choreography to at least make us wonder how he's going to win? Watching the ""Bourne"" car chase not only made me dizzy but made me wonder if any actual action sequence had been staged.This movie is O.K. but not an important film in any sense. The more I thought about it, the less impressed I was. I saw ""I, Robot"" last week and while that was hardly more original, the story did have more meat to it.",The Bourne Supremacy
237,varundelpiero,Another lacklustre sequel...,6,26 November 2008,"I'll keep this short and to the point: THE BOURNE SUPREMACY was a total letdown. None of the good elements from the original were maintained (except the acting; Matt Damon is still good, and Joan Allen and Julia Stiles do well). The screenplay is weak, the action sequences are either boring or so poorly edited they feel incoherent and nauseating, the character development/interaction is stale, the music is uninteresting, and the plot is paper-thin. It just doesn't live up to the intelligence seen in THE BOURNE IDENTITY.Yet another tasteless sequel. I was expecting more, since THE BOURNE IDENTITY was so good, but the change of director was unwarranted. Paul Greengrass (of UNITED 93 fame) feels the need to infuse this movie with needless and hackneyed action just because it falls in the genre action thriller. The lessons learnt from THE BOURNE IDENTITY's success were sadly lost. On a positive note, the final car chase sequence is worth watching because it is more engaging than the other action sequences, and because it comes at the end of the film, leading up to some closure. At the very least it's a bit of a reward for having to sit through the film...6/10 is a bit generous. If it were a stand-alone picture, I would have given THE BOURNE SUPREMACY a 5, but I still have fond memories of the original. 2.5 stars (out of 4). See it, or not.

Paul Grengrass, the director, had a vision that did not fit with this movie.It feel like riding a wooden roller coaster. There were two many out of focus hand held shots. I think that this absolutely tainted the purity of this film.  At times you would almost want to leave and go and watch something else, because the direction is so bad.  At key moments in the movie where the director could have chosen to use all of these fast cuts, jerky, out of focus shots. He didn't. Where like in more intimate moments he completely ruined them with his idea of direction.OKAY NOW THAT I HAVE FINISHED BAD MOUTHING THE DIRECTORThis movie is awesome.

239,veganflimgeek,Great follow up,8,11 August 2004,"Bourne supremacyMatt Damon returns as Jason Bourne and I am surprised to say that while I don't think it was quite as good as the original it is a good follow up. Doug Liman's Bourne Identity was a character driven action film that did not chop story for action. The studio was smart to hire Paul Greengrass the director of the excellent Bloody Sunday. While Bloody Sunday was a genius film it was almost a documentary. So It didn't know what to expect. Very little of the movie is actually based on the novel. In the novel Bourne had assumed his real identity and he and marie lived in Canada. Here he and Marie are living in India. Perhaps the only similar note is that someone is killing people and living clues leading to Bourne who is innocent. In the book the killings were in Hong Kong but I think wisely the film returns to it's European feeling.I think the power of the story is found in the writing. The direction of the actors and the pace is done will but the action leaves something to desire. Greengrass was smart to use annoying shakey cam' in Bloody Sunday but here it causes us to miss out on everything Damon trained for and mostly just gives people head aches.The film however finds Bourne's moral center and shows us the torment that these memories and knowledge is doing to him.***Spoilers***I am sure it was done for business reasons but I was bummed at the death of Marie. She was a good character and I am not sure where they will take the next film since in the books they had children and a family.

240,cwarne_uk,Over Solemn Shaky Camera Bore,2,2 September 2008,"Looking for all the world like a something shot on a mobile phone while falling down a flight of stairs this has to be the most horrible looking film ever made. Greengrass shows little faith in the plot (which is just as well because it is totally unmemorable) and so films in a manner that negates any possible plot. Shaky cameras, ultra-quick edits. It's all great if you think film is just a gimmick akin to an amusement park. It's a style that doesn't invite emotional involvement which is just as well because Jason Bourne has to be the dullest super-assassin-secret-agent in film history- he fits in with the the general tenor of the film very nicely though - everything is treated as solemnly as an Ingmar Bergman film. Watching this I began to yearn for some humour or camp, even a little suspense would be nice, as the film is clearly a money making package, rather than anything else, so sequels are inevitable, suspense is hard to generate. I watched this and then watched ""Crank"", which is cheap, very stupid and a lot of fun. The only thing this film had in common was the stupidity.",The Bourne Supremacy
241,ichabod81,Sublime Supremacy,10,4 April 2005,"The Bourne Supremacy is a good example of a sequel, where everything has gone just right. Some of my friends who have seen this film commented that it was a mistake to kill off Potente's character 15 minutes in. I disagree. For one thing, it gives Damon's Bourne much more space to move and second, it really darkens his character and makes him more focused and interesting.The supporting cast is excellent. From Brian Cox to Joan Allen to even Julia Stiles, they are all in top form. I actually don't like Stiles that much, because she's tortured audiences with tasteless yarns like The Prince & Me and Down to You. The horror. Here, though, Stiles delivers a small, but intense role. And just when you think it doesn't get any better, the jaw-droppingly gorgeous Oksana Akinshina from ""Lilja 4-Ever"" shows up. Plus Chris Cooper. And Karl Urban. Impressive.I loved The Bourne Identity, but this film pushed the envelope even further. In a situation where 007 would use some super gadget, Bourne uses simple household items which he happens to find. And that's a good thing, because it makes the film seem much more realistic. In the first movie, Bourne uses a pencil as a weapon and in Supremacy, a rolled-up newspaper. Pure genius.***** / *****",The Bourne Supremacy
242,echozdog,About as good as the first,8,29 November 2004,"The first movie left the plot of the book about half way through the movie. I only read about 1/4 of the second book, but it looks like they didn't follow much of it all. Not that there's anything wrong with that. The story picks up 2 years later and Jason and Marie are hiding out in India. Jason has been framed (like the book only it's a different murder) and also targeted for kill by the guy who framed him (I'm not sure why they decided to frame him and then kill him..). Anyway the movie takes off when he goes into Bourne mode and kicks but doing his super spy stuff (which is the best parts of the movie). The must have been problems shooting the chase scenes because the dam camera jumping all over the place was driving me nuts. Hey may say it's for dramatic effect, I say it's because if you don't shoot the scene well you can't be edit it into a dramatic one. I don't know. Anyway the plot was good and the character Pamela Landy reminds me of Harvey Keitel in Thelma and Louise. I suppose they will complete make a new plot for the next movie and call it the ""Bourne Ultimatum"" and not follow any of the third book. Not that there's anything wrong with that. 8/10 (would have been 9/10 if the chase scenes were not so camera jumpy).",The Bourne Supremacy
243,Badmoviessuck,spi movie sequel done right,8,21 December 2018,"I am conflicted.
I don't know if this movie is better or worse than the first one, let me explain.PLOT
This movie is plot heavy.
It has a really good and interesting plot about an Russian family getting killed by Bourne but there are flaws about making this movie so plot heavy.
First it felt like a setup movie. This probably is a setup movie to The Bourne Ultimatum cause it took over an hour setting up the plot and most of the stuff isn't yet resolved.
The Bourne identity had an simple plot and it felt more satisfying finishing the movie cause it had an beginning, middle and end but in this movie it feels like there is an beginning and end.CHARACTERS
Cause the movie was so plot heavy they didn't manage to develop Bourne further.
He is still a good character but not as good as in the last movie cause he barely talks.
In ""The Bourne identity"" they manage to develop Bourne greatly and we liked him as a character, they didn't really do that in this movie.
When Marie (I think her name is Marie) died, that was the best scene in the movie.
How Bourne desperately tried to save her under the water and the atmosphere felt empty and it really managed to set the tone for the scene great lighting as well and the emotion Matt Damon portrayed was great, he felt bad but he didn't have time to feel emotional about this cause he needs to survive. Overall a great scene.
The Bounty Hunter is really bad.
He was there in the beginning of the movie and they shoved him in at the end.
He was the biggest reason to why it's so hard for me to choose if this movie is better or ""The Bourne Identity"", but the car chase at the end was good.VERDICT
This movie has some good qualities that the first movie didn't have, but the first movie has more good qualities this movie dosen't have so the first movie might be the better one.",The Bourne Supremacy
244,sanddragon939,Bourne is Supreme,10,4 April 2009,"The Bourne Supremacy was the second installment of Universal Pictures groundbreaking trilogy based on the novels of the late thriller author, Robert Ludlum. However, unlike most flashy and 'style over substance' thrillers these days, the Bourne films have always been considered a neo-realistic take on the morally ambiguous genre of espionage thrillers. This brilliant piece of action packed yet intelligent cinema is certainly no exception. Matt Damon reprises his role as the amnesiac former assassin, Jason Bourne, an ex-operative of the CIA, who turned rogue after he failed to execute an unsanctioned black ops mission and lost his memory in the process. As the film begins, Bourne is living a relatively peaceful life, in hiding, with his girlfriend, Marie Helena Kruetz (Franka Potente). Bourne continues to be haunted by fragmented memories of his former violent life, which he consistently tries to dissociate himself from. However, his past soon catches up with him in the form of a deadly new adversary, Kirill (Karl Urban). And when his beloved Marie dies from the assassin's bullet, a grief-stricken and enraged Bourne, believing his old masters in the CIA are responsible for this assault, resolves to return to Europe and seek revenge against the Agency. The Agency however is not responsible for this attack thought they too have bones to pick with their former asset, as they suspect that Bourne is involved in a conspiracy to cover up the theft of millions of dollars of CIA funds. Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) is determined to capture Bourne and find answers, whereas Ward Abbott (Brian Cox, reprising his role from the previous film) simply wants to terminate Bourne. However, neither are likely to succeed on their respective missions. For Bourne has unleashed every ounce of training and skill, all the killer instincts he was implanted with in a forgotten lifetime, against his creators. He will play their deadly games again, but this time on his own terms. What follows is a nearly 2 hour long cat-and-mouse chase sequence, which begins in a seaside town in India, and continues in the streets of Naples, Munich, Berlin and finally Moscow, as Bourne demonstrates his supremacy in the fields of espionage, unarmed combat, evasive tactics and high-speed pursuits. Ultimately, the Bourne Supremacy is probably the strongest of the trilogy, both in terms of plot and action, and the title therefore is justified in every possible respect. Kudos, to director Paul Greengrass and the rest of the cast and crew for this masterpiece!",The Bourne Supremacy

247,lumieretrain,The Bourne Supremacy by Paul Greengrass,8,23 October 2021,"After the success of The Bourne Identity, inevitably there will have been the request to develop a sequel of the movie; by adapting the second book of the The Bourne Trilogy by Robert Ludlum, or The Bourne Supremacy. But this time, the director Paul Greengrass has been called to direct the next Bourne movie, rather than Doug Liman who directed The Bourne Identity; as with the involvement of the director Paul Greengrass, the direction of the sequel will be different than what it has been seen with the previous one. After a long time of work, in 2004 came out The Bourne Supremacy by Paul Greengrass with Matt Damon, Joan Allen, Brian Cox, Franka Potente and Julia Stiles. The movie's plot: Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente) are living in their own lives, even he is still tormented by some unspecific flashbacks of his past, until a CIA operation gone wrong comprises his life tragically; as Jason Bourne is forced be again a specialized assassin, like he used to be in once, to get more in deep with his past and find out the truth about the CIA operation gone wrong. There were some expectations about how the sequel of the movie will come out, as usually making a sequel of a successful movie, can often times disappoint the audience to be repetitive; while other sequels might work perfectly to be not repetitive, by using new elements of the story to even discover some other surprises about the main characters. Indeed, the movie unexpectedly surprises the audience, the critics and the fans of Ludlum's original work, to have maintained some of the essential elements which have been established from the previous movie; at the same time, the movie has added some different elements from the previous movie, which has much realism to let the audience feel the dynamism of the story through unexpected grittiness moments. The production designer Dominic Watkins has elaborated settings, to maintain the realism of the story with specific spaces, colors and elements needed for the movie to have important meanings to be shown; especially at the moments where Jason Bourne has to solve some of the most complicated mysteries connected with his past, while he is facing several dangers which compromises his search of the questions that have to be answered. The costume designer Dinah Collin has specifically created costumes to fit with the shape and the colors of the characters, especially when Jason Bourne has to face several dangers, where the costumes allow him to move and run in some of the most dynamic moments as well as thrilling ones of the movie. The cinematographer Oliver Wood has captured some of the most essential moments of the movie, in every single camera movements and in every single angle shots, to be unforgettable as well as powerful; at the same time, the camera shots some of the most thrilling moments of the movie in a gritty way, to let the audience feel the dynamism as well as the realism of the story, especially in the fight sequences. The editors Richard Pearson and Christopher Rouse have created the narration's rhythm in a precise way of how the story will be told from the beginning to the end, as they have used the essential footage needed to tell the story; in the same way the editing of the fight sequences has been elaborated to be much dynamic filled with several jump cuts, which let the audience feel the punches as well as the kicks between Jason Bourne and his rivals. The score by John Powell has been elaborated with musical notes which balance between some of the most thrillingly dynamic moments of the story, by changing into some of the most emotional moments of the story; as the musical notes fuses with the story, without distorting the moments of the movie to be shown. Matt Damon did an extraordinary performance as Jason Bourne, an amnesiac former assassin who once has lost something very precious, he will do anything to find out the truth about the CIA operation which made him lose his most precious thing; at the same time he has to explore more about his past, to see more about himself and what he has committed further more in once. Joan Allen did an excellent performance as Pamela Landy, the deputy director of the CIA and task force chief who follows the activity of Jason Bourne, after the CIA operation went wrong. Brian Cox did an excellent performance as Ward Abbott, the CIA section Chief who wants in all the way to stop Jason Bourne, especially for the secrets which will make Pamela Landy suspicious about him. Franka Potente did a well done performance as Marie Kreutz, the girlfriend of Jason Bourne who stayed with him and tries to help him with the issues he has; until the CIA operation gone wrong has put a tragedy on Jason Bourne, which pushed him to search in what he is looking for. Julia Stiles did an excellent performance as Nicky Parsons, a former agent who has been assigned to assist in the search of Jason Bourne; she will be the one to give some answers of what Jason Bourne is looking for. The Bourne Supremacy is one of the best sequels ever made, which is filled with surprising thrilling moments to be unexpected, at the same time the movie has some of the strongest moments to be unexpectedly emotional.",The Bourne Supremacy

249,RyanEberhart,Superb!,10,11 August 2013,"The pace of these movies are fast. If you look away from the screen for a second you miss something. This movie doesn't disappoint. I love these movies. None of these movies have outdone any of the others. They have matched each other in every way.Matt Damon reprises his role as Jason Bourne. Back again is Franka Potente as Marie; Brian Cox as Ward Abbott; and Julia Stiles as Nicky. New characters are Pamela Landy, played by Joan Allen, and Kirill, played by Karl Urban.Two years after the first movie Jason Bourne is drawn out of hiding, well hiding in plain sight, because he is set-up as the fall guy. Because of the set-up Pamela Landy is set on Bourne's trail and she is relentless. Relentless until she figures out that Bourne had nothing to do with what went wrong with her operation.The chase scenes are really what make this movie worth while. Those and the rest of the script. So I would have to say that from start to finish this is a great movie... just like the others.Just like Identity I have some favorite scenes. And guess what? They are all action scenes.The first is the scene where Jason and Marie are trying to get away from Kirill. Kirill is the one who has set Jason up that screwed up Pamela Landy's operation. Kirill goes to India to kill Jason, but he kills Marie instead.The second scene I like is when Jason goes to Moscow to apologize to the daughter of the couple he killed in his first assignment. He was only supposed to kill Vladimir Neski and make it look like natural causes. However, Neski's wife arrives unexpectedly and Jason has to change his plans. He set it up to look like Neski was killed by his wife and then shot herself.Another favorite scene is when Jason and Pamela have their final phone conversation. Pamela tells Jason what his real name is. This scene shows at least some familiarization or a friendship brewing between Pamela and Jason.I love these movies.I give this 10 stars out of 10.",The Bourne Supremacy
250,Scorching,Good enough,7,19 November 2004,"I didn't really think too much of the first movie, so I was rather surprised that they came up with a sequel. Somehow I think this movie is very similar to the first so much that perhaps they could have merged the two and form one movie. So much so that a lot of the unresolved elements of Identity took up most of this one. Of course this meant that there was only a little time for the newly introduced characters.There was that little tremor at the start of the movie which really surprised me. I thought that was a good touch that made me more interested in the movie. I just wish they had it a little more into the middle of the film rather than where it was.In terms of action I thought the action scenes were just as good as the first. It was sufficient but nothing much to crow about. I however still cannot get used to the fact that Matt Damon can do an effective enough job as an action star.",The Bourne Supremacy

The director takes a chaotic approach, using jerky camera shots, unusual angles and jagged editing to obscure an inferior plot. One has to look no further than the five-minute or so car chase scene to realize that this movie didn't have enough depth to follow the original on its story-telling merits. On a positive note, Matt Damon again turns in an excellent performance as Jason Bourne. Joan Allen also does well in her role as a CIA big shot. Julia Stiles is wasted in a small role.",The Bourne Supremacy

This is a special warning to my Mum and anyone else!This film gave us all a headache. I was with a group of friends, and we all felt a bit ill by the end. The camera movement is unrelenting. The whole thing is shot cinema verite style, and as a result is very shaky. It's like the cameraman was wearing very lumpy shoes or something.

254,josephrygaard,Before Watching: The Bourne Supremacy (2004),7,15 July 2019,"""The Bourne Supremacy"" (2004) is the second, action-filled movie within the Bourne-franchise. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Generally speaking, The Bourne Supremacy is more intense, more violent and more intellectually demanding than its prequel, but also less charming. A few events in the beginning rob the movie of a part of its soul, which it later tries to compensate for with more spectacular scenes then what we were treated with in The Bourne Identity. The more you prefer action over character dynamics, the less of an issue this creates. However, the opposite is also true.As said above, this movie is more demanding than the first installment. Attention needs to be put into understanding events and reasoning, otherwise the movie might come across as all too random and complicated.Finally, The Bourne Supremacy begins the trend of which the Bourne-franchise is infamous for: the shaky cam. Although it can be a bit distracting sometimes, Greengrass handles it well and it is not too confusing nor disorientating. Do not let it put you off beforehand. It only gets in your way if you constantly think about it.My personal grade: a fast-paced 7/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews.",The Bourne Supremacy

I was worried that this one was a little rushed in production and perhaps the plot would suffer, but instead I was totally riveted and enthralled with the story and characters. The direction is very well done and I enjoyed the fast-paced, jerky feel of the camera work, which makes you feel as if you're right in the middle of the action. The older generation in our theater grumbled at the end of the movie from this, but I thought it was very appropriately used. The acting is so superb that I realize how bad the acting is in many of the recent films I have viewed. My only complaint is that it does run a little long, but I can't say specifically anything I would have been able to take out. Still, I highly recommend it!",The Bourne Supremacy

257,katydid4819,Bourne For Success,7,24 July 2004,"The Bourne Supremacy is this summer's perfect companion to Spiderman. It follows the same rules of ordinary person with amazing powers but at the same time, giving this person some emotion such as doubt and fear. Catwoman, released this weekend as well, is like the weaker cousin to these two. It's not that girl power isn't cool but it needs to be treated with the same maturity that the old fashion man gets.Maturity is what sets Bourne aside from his closest comparison. Bond, James Bond. Not that age is the gauge here but Matt Damon's Jason Bourne is more serious and less happy-go-lucky-I-think-I'll-forget-my-mission-and-go-talk-to-this-girl in his manner. Hence the lack of abrupt stops for a half naked woman to coo softly `Oh, Jason' during this film.The emotional tone of this movie is created in a very honest way. If the scene calls for the audience to be on edge, the camera does not dart behind the hero and take him into dark areas where it is hard to see what might jump out next. Cheap sight gags are a dime a dozen in most suspenseful movies and even though Supremacy' is not a suspense driven feature, it comes with its share of uncertainty.Actually, uncertainty is a major tone. It speaks of Bourne's lack of knowledge about himself and his past. The camera takes on a very loose feel during a hand-to-hand combat scene and that puts the audience just far enough out that we can't tell exactly what's happening. It doesn't help that both men look alike and are clothed in all black. We are unaware of how Bourne is faring and that puts us in his mind set. At the same time that we feel this way, however, Damon gives his character an almost unreal sense of knowing everything. Maybe he doesn't know why but he still can figure things out fast and seems to know exactly what to do all the time. He always knows where he is going and what he's going to do when he gets there. He also has this amazing way of knowing what his opponent is going to do.The plot is not over looked in this movie in exchange for high-speed car chases and extensive damage for no reason. Yes, these exist too but not in the same way that they do in movies like Independence day or Minority Report. What drives the plot is the supporting cast actually. Bourne spends a lot of time getting from here to there and occasionally will move the story in a new direction but not as much as his cast mates. The strongly written part (played by Joan Allen) of the CIA member looking for Bourne is aided by the return cast member Julia Stiles showing that she is stronger in supporting than in lead (don't see The Prince and Me). Both women display a strong screen presence and the girl power that Catwoman was trying for. ****/*****",The Bourne Supremacy
258,gray4,the worst kind of sequel,5,26 September 2005,"The worst kind of sequel is the one that arrogantly assumes that you have seen and remembered the original. So the director arrogantly and lazily makes no attempt to explain what has happened previously. I saw The Bourne Identity a year or so ago, but it wasn't so memorable that I remembered the plot or the characters' backgrounds. The Bourne Supremacy starts with and is based on the assumption that I know more about Jason Bourne's background than he does himself. As a result, the film is confused and the confusion compounded by too many wobbly hand-held camera sequences. Matt Damon is as leaden as ever and the ending....

259,John K.-2,Realism Rules,8,22 August 2004,"Someone once said that to be successful, entertainment has to be either fantasy or realism. The B.S. is definitely trying for the latter, with lots of wobbly or blurred camera shots, several real life contemporary locations, and a plot that's largely feasible. While I found the shaky camera work a bit wearing after a while, and most of the locations to be (deliberately?) grey or washed out in colour, it makes a nice change to have the-world-outside-America represented by more than just London, Paris and Rome for once -- and in the other cities chosen, the tourist landmarks only make cameo appearances rather than getting blown up. The plot isn't bad, either - nice to see  the hero actually hurting himself when making a death-defying leap, and not suddenly recovering. The car chase at the end is also good, and creepily reminiscent of Diana's death - a bit too much realism, maybe? It's even feasible to drive Naples to Berlin in 2 days - it's only 800 miles, I thought it was much further. Must be that Italian traffic ...  [END SPOILER]All in all, a worthy effort.

260,Whythorne,"Inferior ""Supremacy""",2,2 February 2006,"Sequel is far inferior to the first, ""The Bourne Identity"", which although bore only a little resemblance to the book by Ludlum, was an excellent, legitimately gripping thriller.The film fails mainly not because of the story but because of Greengrass's frenetic, incompetent direction.Everything that takes place is subordinate to the style of the film, which, for me, continually distracted from plot, action, and dialog. I am referring to the shaky hand-held camera, which by this time is about as cutting-edge as a 1980s Docker's commercial. That, along with spastic editing, are the main culprits. I wish directors would realize that nowadays, a movie shot with the hand-held just gives it (in most cases) a cheesy TV drama feel. Obviously, the intent is to make dialog scenes more interesting and action scenes seem ""confusingly"" real.The shaky camera is unrelenting and without respite, even being used during non-action scenes so much that it becomes something worse than a self-conscious, pretentious gimmick...it just becomes an endless irritation.Director Greengrass doesn't seem to get it...the blurry scenes and split-second herky-jerky glimpses we are given are so confusing, and impart such little visual information to the viewer, that it is impossible to tell what is going on and therefore, impossible to get drawn into a scene's tension. So instead of making a scene more exciting, the annoying technique makes it far less so.A perfect example is the fight scene between Bourne and an assassin, which can be compared to Jason's battle in his Paris apartment in the original. In the original movie, that fight scene was tense and exciting. In the sequel, it was like trying to watch two men fighting while lit by a strobe light, from the vantage point of a whizzing, out-of-control merry-go-round.Ditto for the car chase scenes, which may as well have been viewed from the trunk of Jason's car for all we could tell was happening.SPOILER HERE Another big disappointment was the killing off of Franka Potente's character early in the film. She's a fun actress to watch and was a huge part of the first Bourne movie. Further, it has become an all too familiar gimmick in films like this, where the filmmakers are concerned about the hero getting tied up with one woman, in spite of the fact that somehow Ludlum was able to make it work with his books.Disappointing all the way around, even to the redundant and unoriginal use of the same song by Moby for the closing credits that was used in the first film.

The film has some extremely quirky camera work that helps the film with it's exciting and fast-paced action. Bourne gives everyone a slip and makes his getaway through his travels in Europe as he seemingly disappears from a number of organisations The film plot is sometimes ridiculous with some agents working alone and then they're out to kill each one other. The car chase scenes in Moscow may be lacking the earlier film with the Mini but it's excellent with Jason Bourne supposedly smashing a couple of Ladas up as he makes his getaway without the use of cunning gadgets. Of course. Ladas were once imported into England until environmental lead-burning issues lead to their withdrawal from the English market.

I was also impressed with Damon's moves--lightning fast chops and kicks that barely registered on the screen. I recommended this movie to many others as not your typical action movie.For some reason I put off watching the Bourne Supremacy until this weekend on video. I can't explain the reluctance to view it until now---perhaps I didn't believe a sequel could be just as good. Thank goodness I finally picked it up: the movie is not ""just as good,"" it is superior. I have watched it three times now.First of all, the score is really superior and acts excruciating tension to the movie, particularly the chase sequence when Jason Bourne is finally forced to run on foot to elude capture. That chase sequence is the centerpiece of the movie and it is perfectly rendered, beginning with the telephone ring that awakens Jason from his recovered memory and into flight. The score is accompanied by a cacophony of yelling by the German police, which one could liken to dogs barking as the fox is hunted down. Just perfect. His flight through the brilliantly photographed Berlin streets and rooftops, profiled in long shots wearing black reminds you of Jack the Ripper flying through gas lit London. Damon gives an astounding performance as someone who doesn't have to ponder escape plans--he was so well-trained that his body simply does what it needs to do when it needs to do it.We have fewer and fewer good films these days, so I'm delighted when I can experience a well-crafted adult movie. I'm actually sorry that I can't re-experience the film for the first time--the adrenalin jolt forced me to my feet! Obviously you can tell I liked this movie and I look forward to another episode. I've enjoyed the way Bourne's character has been built--his reliance on maps and schedules, for example--makes you chuckle when he pulls a map out and hastily scans it for directions.Brilliant movie.",The Bourne Supremacy
266,rtrnt,"Explosive, rousing sequel keeps Bourne saga apace",8,27 December 2020,"This strong follow-up to The Bourne Identity picks up almost immediately where we left off, with Jason Bourne being targeted early on by his former CIA superiors who believe him to have gone rogue and become dangerous on his own. This film follows Bourne's exploits starting in India and following him to Naples and then to Berlin, where he faces off against his pursuers. Along the way, CIA operative Joan Allen starts to suspect there is more going on underneath the surface.Greengrass's eye of gripping action sequences is on display on this film throughout. And the film does not hold back in terms of visceral, explicit violence. The brutal nature of the film might not be for everyone's taste but you will the storyline is quite sharp and Damon brings his A game. Brian Cox is well-deployed as a Treadstone operative who knows much more than the rest of us. Allen is quite good at the helm of the efforts to take down Bourne. This installment is well worth watching. Strongly recommended.",The Bourne Supremacy
267,Euphorbia,Sequelitis,6,12 December 2004,"The Bourne Identity is a very good film. Its realistic action was given depth by the relationship of Jason and Marie. This vitality is missing from the mediocre sequel, The Bourne Supremacy, in large part because Marie's appearance in this sequel is just a brief cameo with no depth, and which would have no meaning apart from her central role in the first Bourne movie. Franka Potente still gets top billing in the credits, even though her screen time in Supremacy is barely a couple of minutes. Moreover, the conflict of Bourne vs Conklin vs Ward Abbott in the first movie gives both energy and plausibility to the action. Ward Abbott alone is not an interesting or energetic enough adversary to build this sequel upon, and the addition of Kirill does not add much, since he has no more depth than the disposable Treadstoners of the first film -- just more screen time than they had. Pamela Landy might have been an interesting antagonist turned protagonist, but her character does not evolve over the course of the movie, even when she changes her mind about Bourne, and neither for that matter does Bourne's character, nor anyone else's. Many reviewers, even some halfway intelligent ones, rated this Bourne sequel higher than the first film. Are their standards really that low? I've tried to apportion the blame for the sequelitis suffered by this film, but with limited success. Maybe it's fault of the original novels, but I haven't read them. The story of Bourne Supremacy is certainly weaker than that of Bourne Identity. It is merely episodic, rather than following a true story arc. Its arc is so low that even a really talented director would have trouble Limbo-ing under it. Various things happen in sequence, but none of them really matters, or changes anything. The movie ends with yet another sequel hook. Sigh... Doug Liman did a much better job directing Identity than Paul Greengrass did with Supremacy. Even though I detest Liman's movie, Swingers, he does have what it takes for cinematic greatness. Greengrass, on the other hand, seems to be a journeyman second-unit director who has over-reached himself. Greengrass's disjointed car chase in Moscow is a weak shadow of Liman's brilliantly choreographed turn in Paris. The cinematography of The Bourne Supremacy is downright bad. Greengrass's odd trick of constantly jerking the camera to agitate the action is annoying after the first 10 seconds, and painful to watch thereafter. It was a bad idea, badly executed -- or maybe it was merely the vacuum resulting from a lack of good ideas. Bourne Identity: 8+/10 Bourne Supremacy: 6-/10I wish I had never seen Bourne Supremacy, because it has cheapened Bourne Identity for me. But I guess I couldn't resist.",The Bourne Supremacy
268,compi24,"Review Of ""The Bourne Supremacy""",9,18 September 2011,"In 2004 film ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is the Paul Greengrass-directed sequel to the acclaimed Doug Liman film ""The Bourne Identity"". The story follows the amnesiac titular character (Damon) as he attempts to find out more about his past as a black ops agent for the CIA. One of the things I noticed first about this film was the film's shift in aesthetics. Though Director Paul Greengrass' use of hand-held cameras has often come under considerable disagreement from some critics and fans, I feel that this aspect of the film really sort of adds to the intensity of a lot of the action and dialogue sequences. While the camera-work may have changed, there are certain things about the film that stayed close to what made the first movie so successful. For one, Matt Damon's performance is once again terrific, and with his portrayal, the audience really gets to see some sides of Jason Bourne that they might not gotten to see in ""Identity"". John Powell's score is really well done, as it uses all of the themes from ""Identity"", but develops upon those themes so that we feel as though we are watching a different chapter in Bourne's life. Tony Gilroy's screenplay contains really compelling and entertaining dialogue and a very interesting adaption of Robert Ludlum's story. The action sequences are spectacular as well, for they once again showcase Jason Bourne's incredible ability to overcome immense odds with the skills he learned in the CIA. All in all, I felt that ""The Bourne Supremacy"" was a worthy installment in the ""Bourne"" franchise that upped the emotion and action to an impressive degree.",The Bourne Supremacy
269,CinemaCocoa,"The glue of the trilogy, but it is a shaky-cam mess",6,13 April 2017,"Paul Greengrass takes over the series as director, and very much feels like he cut his teeth with this one.Despite being freely off the grid and with the head of the insidious Treadstone project killed, Bourne believes the worst is over. But when a Russian assassin takes away the only thing left in Bourne's life, he thinks Treadstone is after him once again. But the plot is even thicker than he can knowEven perhaps a decade later, my opinion of The Bourne Supremacy has not changed in the slightest. I love this trilogy, I even have the steelbook edition, but Supremacy really doesn't sit well with me and not just by comparison of its far superior (no pun intended) siblings.I love me some consistency, and the trilogy delivers that in spades. John Powell returns with an electrifying twist on his original score for Bourne Identity, and even Moby's Extreme Ways returns for the end credits, Matt Damon and Brian Cox reprise their roles very well. In fact I would say the latter steals the show, delivering a frail, cowardly yet sadly sympathetic antagonist, and his scenes with newcomer Joan Allen are probably the most effective for me. The film still has that edgy atmosphere whenever Bourne is stalking around Europe, America and Russia in this globe-trotting sequel, the tension is still real.Yet the editing is atrocious!I really mean it. 2004 must have been when shaky-cam became a thing because Supremacy's action sequences are really, really bad. Not even restricted to the action sequences, even regular tracking shots and panning shots are wobbling all over the place. I appreciate some of it, to invoke kinetic action and uncontrolled rage (representing Bourne's own survival instincts) but you have to dial it back. All I tend to take away from this film is 1. the film's main action set piece, a car chase around Moscow, is heavily shaky-cam, and 2. this is suffers from second installment syndrome.To watch Supremacy alone is pointless. At one hour thirty-seven minutes it flies by, none of the returning characters are given time to re-establish themselves, new characters are barely touched on. Without the first film's great pacing and establishing and the third films incredible payoff, Supremacy is just noise.There are moments of cleverness that I enjoy; the chase Bourne makes from Police that involves running across two train tracks, off a bridge, onto a boat only to double-back back onto the bridge again from underneath? That was impressive. That and how Bourne takes control of the situation from underneath the organisation hunting him. It is a fantastic ""you got owned"" scene that does so much to empower our hero and validate every other characters' fear of him.Of course, I said earlier I love this trilogy. Supremacy is redeemed by its successor, and Supremacy is the glue that the series relies upon, take it out and it falls apart. But as a singular experience I really don't think highly of it in cinematography terms.",The Bourne Supremacy
270,hprill,Not bad at all,8,1 November 2004,"I always hesitate to praise movies from the spy thriller/action movie category like this one, mostly because they're all about adrenalin release rather than plot or character development, but saying that, The Bourne Supremacy isn't bad at all.A fast pace is set at the very beginning, and the pace never slows down, the plot always stays taut, and there are no noticeable lengths of any kind. I still like Matt Damon in the role -- don't ask me why, but I still think he has the perfect face for the role, a cross between a hint of childlike innocence and dark determination, something he also had in The Talented Mr Ripley. He meets a perfect match in Joan Allen, who shows similar determination.The hand-held camera work has been criticized, but I never found it annoying or distracting, it always seemed to be just right.And yes, there are plot holes, plenty of them -- the indestructibility of Jason Bourne being the major one, but there's also a totally unnecessary murder that's not only unmotivated and out of character, but also seems to serve no particular purpose other than allowing the killer to die later on.But all of that doesn't make this a bad movie; in fact if there's a future for the spy thriller formula, I figure it's in movie like this rather than in the James Bond franchise, which has clearly been worn out to the limits.MINOR SPOILER: if you intend to watch this for Franka Potente, don't. She doesn't have as much screen time as you'd expect from an actor whose name appears second in the credits.If you watch this because you want a fast-paced action movie, go for it. There are no surprises, no plot twists, but you'll get 90 minutes of solid action that are worth the ticket price. 8/10, easily.",The Bourne Supremacy

I wanted to slap the director for wasting my time and patience and a perfectly good paperback book.The movie picks up a little momentum in the middle, and by the end it's more fun including one of the best car chases ever.

273,brainofj72,The Bourne Disappointment,6,27 November 2005,"In 2002, up-and-coming director Doug Liman offered up a thrilling adaptation of Robert Ludlum's espionage novel The Bourne Identity, and in doing so, he presented the perfect espionage thriller - great acting, a strong script, perfect direction, fitting music, and just the right touch of realistic action. After Identity proved successful at the box office, the studios decided they wanted a sequel, of course, so the next logical step was Ludlum's second novel in the series, The Bourne Supremacy. Liman had moved on to other things (Mr. and Mrs. Smith), so who was put at the helm of Supremacy? Television director Paul Greengrass. This was not a good decision.In Identity, Jason Bourne (Damon) was pulled from the ocean with two bullets in his back and was stricken with amnesia. He was chased by many killers, and eventually discovered that he was a finely-tuned CIA assassin. He managed to fall off the grid into obscurity. Supremacy picks up right where Identity left off, with Bourne in India. Now, he has been framed for a double-murder and robbery, and must come out of hiding to tie up loose ends once and for all.The film had infinite potential. Finally, someone was making a sequel to a movie worth making a sequel to. However, this project just fell into the wrong hands. Greengrass can't direct his way out of a paper bag. Nearly every single shot throughout the entire film is hand-held. It's tolerable for a while, but it eventually just becomes grating. Hasn't this guy ever heard of a tripod? But the film's failure certainly does not lie in the hands of Greengrass alone. The script is, to put it bluntly, not very good. The dialogue is often laughable, and unlike the first film, the characters occasionally just come off as stupid as they throw themselves into pointless fight/chase sequences for no apparent reason. Not at all like Identity, where every fight scene had a purpose. Also, in Identity, when there was action, it was brutal and believable. Nothing felt fantastic - it all felt very real (especially the car chase, which was just about the best since Bullitt). In Supremacy, however, everything loses the edgy feeling of a realistic spy thriller and takes on the persona of a Hollywood action flick. Every fight scene and car chase (yes, there is more than one car chase) is loaded with Michael Bay-esqe hand-held hyper-cuts. It's hard to tell what's even going on sometimes - it all just turns into a headache-inducing blur.The film is certainly not a complete failure, though. The acting from Matt Damon and Brian Cox is excellent, as usual, though the rest of the cast is sorely lacking (Joan Allen gives a forced and insipid performance). The film is also quite entertaining. And I must admit, it's still nice to have any kind of continuation to the stellar Identity, even if it's quite lackluster.I'm still holding out hope for the trilogy's closing, The Bourne Ultimatum. Let's just hope it falls into capable hands.6/10",The Bourne Supremacy
274,mrvino15,"Good flick, although has a couple flaws",8,30 July 2004,"Good story, I actually liked the storyline better than the first... I was never disinterested in this movie.. The only flaws that I say were: Not enough fight scenes, too much ""shaky"" camera especially in the car chase scene, and the ""first person"" view fight scene was terrible... The fight scenes could've been soo much more if they actually pulled back enough to let you watch it... Acting was great. Other than that, totally recommend it.. 7/10",The Bourne Supremacy
275,jon2005,The Bourne Supremacy,8,22 May 2006,"With the first film, The Bourne Identity (2002), Matt Damon showed the world that he was a believable action film star. The Bourne Supremacy is certainly a match for the first film, yet it also feels so different (more on this in a mo). However, it still shows that this is a franchise that can easily stand up to any other spy film, even the long running Bond series. But this is a different kind of film than Bond's various outings. There's no quick one-liners, no endless array of women to pick up, and no high-tech gadgetry. Instead, director Paul Greengrass focuses on the character of Bourne as a person, someone who can feel both physical and emotional pain. He may seem cold at times, but is certainly far from being emotionless. And unlike many spies in films, he can be hurt; he falls on his leg at one point, and has to limp through the rest of the film. This all adds up to a character who feels so human, like it could be anyone you pass on the street. It makes you care about what is happening to him, and also makes you wonder whether all will end up fine in the end, like the Bond films always do; you know Bond will triumph and there will be no consequences, whereas with Bourne you're not quite sure if all will go quite so smoothly. As with the last film, the action scenes are mostly short and brutal; Bourne has a very physical approach to dealing with the people on his trail. These climax in an extremely well shot car chase through Moscow. Whilst it is an awesome scene, with realism highest on the agenda (none of this fake laws-of-physics-stretching stuff that seems so popular in Hollywood), it does seem a tad too long, and you end up wanting it to finish soon so your brain has some time to catch up. But this is a small point to make, as the rest of the film is so well paced, without feeling the need to bung in an action scene just because there hasn't been one for almost ten whole minutes, like so many films (stand up Van Helsing, we're talking about you). If there is one complaint to be made about The Bourne Supremacy it is that it doesn't feel as fresh as the first film. In Identity, the audience are as baffled as Bourne about his true identity, and that was one of the attractions of that film  we really didn't know what would happen next. With the majority of his memories returned, we now know what skills Bourne has, and what he would do in certain situations. What made the first film so good was the fact that we didn't know what skills he had; the scene where he uses martial arts on the police for the first time, and his own reaction to what just happened was typical of what made the first film so appealing.However, the cast are all of high standard, especially Joan Allen and Brian Cox as two CIA bosses vying for control of the situation. Franka Potente makes a brief return as Bourne's love interest and is the source for his emotional trauma, but it is Matt Damon's portrayal of Jason Bourne which is definitely the stand out here. Ironically, even though he is the lead character, he has the least to say in the film, instead relying on shots of him quietly brooding and contemplating his next move to make us feel sympathy for him. This, and the original, is certainly the most intelligent and well-crafted spy film for ages.Rated: 7.5/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.netSecond opinion/Re-viewing:The score for The Bourne Supremacy was always a bit of a tough one. I felt that although it should be an 8, the fact that it was not as fresh as the first film brought it down. However, having viewed it again I think that it does thoroughly deserve a score of 8. If anything, it is even more intense than The Bourne Identity, and director Paul Greengrass' use of the shaky camera gives the film a gritty, real-life feel that complements what the film is about. Although I still can't decide which film I prefer, I think they are equally as good as each other, and both deserve the same score. With The Bourne Ultimatum due in 2007 - again with Greengrass directing - my hopes are high for a stellar spy trilogy.Re-rated: 8/10",The Bourne Supremacy

I will rent his ""Bloody Sunday"" on this recommendation alone.With minor flaws (see below), this one was obviously a team effort all the way. Of course, it is a spy thriller, so don't expect the problems of the world to be solved, or a huge emotional investment by the viewer, or something to write home about. It is merely an enjoyable movie on all levels. How many of the current Hollywood ""efforts"" can really claim that? Answer: Very few.My primary criterion for any movie is the ""watch it many times"" test; this one passes it with flying colors. I even _bought_ the DVD, rather than just renting it. To those who know how tight I am, that is heavy praise! Excellent flick!_But_ my vote is ""only"" 8 out of 10. This is really quite a good rating from me, but does not rate tops. Primarily because the scene where Kirill (Karl Urban) shoots poor Marie (Franka Potente) has some spoilingly-poor details, including a ""bucking"" rifle (no good shooter would allow that), and an unbroken rear window of the getaway vehicle, seen when it is hauled, later, out of the river into which it careened off the bridge.

278,stu9003,More of the same stuff but nowhere near as good as the first time,5,14 August 2004,"The Bourne Supremacy features more of the same espionage-style action as in Bourne Identity. Once again, the CIA is trying to kill Jason Bourne and, once again, he expertly turns the tables on them. There's more cat and mouse spy stuff, more exotic locations, and another car chase. In some ways, it's like watching the first movie all over again, except that its nowhere near as good.One big problem for me is that there's a real lack of a human element to this movie, something that Marie's death contributes to (not much of a spoiler, she dies 10 mins into the movie). In the first film, Bourne's personality and character was really fleshed out through his various interactions with Marie. It's how the audience got to know and care about him. But in this movie, Marie's gone, leaving Bourne with no companions, which means he never has any real conversations with other people. As a result, he seems more like a machine than a person.The action scenes were OK, but they were pretty much the same sort of thing that was done in the first movie. The car chase is a prime example. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't even close to being as good as the car chase in Bourne Identity.

This is absolutely how the spy/action genre film should be done; what are the DePalma apologists who still think ""Mission: Impossible"" was a good movie going to do after seeing this? I'm surprised the movie did good business, considering the general collapse of moviegoer intelligence over the past 30 years; you must pay attention or you will be left behind. It's worth expending a few brain cells on something this accomplished.Extracting a movie this good from the labored, uninspired writing of Robert Ludlum is quite a feat. The same team of filmmakers could create a series of superthrillers, each one more intense than the last, by grabbing the ""Quiller"" series by the late Adam Hall (who also wrote ""The Flight of the Phoenix"" under another name).

I only read Identity, and they changed that horribly so that the USA looks like the bad guy (not really the case in the books). This movie seemed to do the same for the hour I watched.Ludlum is likely spinning in his grave, which explains the timing of these films. He died in 2001, and these two films are 2002 and 2005 because they couldn't have gotten away with usurping Jason Bourne in this way were he still alive.

The hand-held cameras were annoying and distracting and took away the feeling of being caught up in the action. They were intended to give that feeling, but the overuse has the opposite effect. When the action is that fast a hand-held doesn't give us more of the chaotic action of a fight, it only brings chaos, and is something Hollywood should consider. I was surprised to see Marie killed at the beginning, but it reminds us of the stark brutality of Bourne's job. In the first movie we saw a Bourne that was uneasy around women. He worked as a loner and probably would have been uneasy with anyone who could compromise his situation. In the second, with Marie dead we get a chance to see the real Bourne, alone, the way he really was. With the Tredstone project dead I liked the interaction with the Neski daughter.

Part of the problem for me may have been the crowded theater; I had to sit too close to the screen.

In the case of the Bourne films, it's probably all of the above, and maybe more, but the first one is by far the better of the two films.I thought there was a lot to like about the Bourne Identity. The acting was solid, the storyline was very interesting, and it was a very enjoyable film, and the sequel just doesn't match it. In fact, I'd be willing to say that there isn't much difference between the Bourne Supremacy and any other random summertime action flick. It was flat, and it had far too much emphasis on the chase and action scenes. The script wasn't as good, and the characters were not nearly as interesting. At times, the storyline was too predictable and cliché. In summary, the Bourne Supremacy is fine as an action film, but as a follow-up to the Bourne Identity, it was not very good. I'm glad I saved myself the money and didn't see it in the theater.",The Bourne Supremacy
289,templar77099,Better than Identity,8,2 August 2016,"In my efforts to prepare myself to ""Jason Bourne"" I've started binge-watching all the films in the series. Although I liked ""The Bourne Identity"" very much, I think ""Supremacy"" is above it. It expands and builds upon the first one's foundations and, since, there was a director change, the film feels very fresh and unique. I know some movie-goers don't appreciate Greengrass's camera work, I don't think we can label it as ""shaky-cam"" because that would be an injustice. I've seen flicks which use this kind of technique very abusively, specially in fight scenes, mostly to hide the fact that, in fact, stunt-men are doing it. But, in Bourne, I don't get that feeling. In this particular case its just the director's choice, not a constraint. It helps to give the film a unique look and cinematography.In this one they've upped the ante, specially on action scenes. Karl Urban's ""Kirill"" is a welcoming addition to the already established set of characters, working as a match to Bourne. The nods to the first entry are also very interesting and serve to expand on Bourne's backstory and the quest for his identity. Matt Damon once again is perfect as the tichilor character, bringing toughness and intelligence to this mysterious man. The returning cast does its job, specially Brian Cox's ""Ward Abbot"" who plays a more pivotal role compared to ""Identity"". Joan Allen's ""Pamela Landy"" is also an interesting addition to the film, giving it even more women power. The edginess and realism brought to this whole affair is distinctive and helps setting the whole series apart from other stories within the spy genre. Although, I'm a James Bond fanboy, since I've started to watch Bourne I've grown quite fond of the series specially for its authenticity and outside the box plot, acting and action. Recommended.

Julia Stiles is the only young actress today with the right degree of vulnerability and sophistication for her role. Matt Damon is Matt Damon.This is a fast-paced ride around the world. I particularly enjoyed visiting the state of Goa in India, and the chase scenes around Berlin and Moscow have left me with more of an intimate knowledge of these cities than I could ever have imagined.The film is an artful mixture of intellectual dialogue and gut-wrenching suspense. The only drawback was an excessive use of hand-held camera, I felt a little queasy and sometimes the camera is so shaky it left me unable to follow the action.Bourne Supremacy should blow Catwoman out of the water (sorry Catwoman!)This is #2 of a trilogy, isn't it?

292,soulcharmer,A movie that saves the genre,8,28 October 2004,"I'm really sick of Bond stupidities and all top-secret-super-human-special-agent crap like Mission impossible and whatnot. And here we have another movie of the same genre that has almost nothing in common with the aforementioned junk. Bourne Supremacy along with its prequel Bourne Identity is polished and professionally made action thriller with thick plot, distinguishable characters, gadgets and more.The necessary romance is subtle and believable (or the one in Bourne Identity), fight scenes have real and frantic feel to them without demented one-liners, explosions are blissfully devoid of American fireworks I despise so much, the environment is all European which I like even more. Musical score is truly remarkable, one you easily remember and recognize if you hear it again. Many complained on shaky camera work but for me, it was another thing that added to the atmosphere.The pace of the movie is fast, but I felt that every needed detail was there, I was not able to notice any major logical plot holes or outright nonsense apart from some errors in scene scripts. That's why I liked the movie so much, for me it was pretty much believable as a whole and in the set context. (Minor spoilers: well, I didn't know they have armored cabs in Moscow, nor do I think the police all over the Europe is so disciplined and perceptive in chasing the fugitive, but as I said, this is nitpicking.)As a bonus you get one of the most memorable car chases out there... This movie is in my opinion real accomplishment and it's kinda good there are so few of them because these are the ones that define the quality in its genre.And one more thing: Supremacy though it is a sequel is not notably worse compared to its predecessor which is surely a good thing. 8/10",The Bourne Supremacy
293,cwx,Good direction brought down by the script,7,1 June 2006,"It can be a little frustrating seeing a ""spy plot"" unravel to the point where you realize there wasn't much of anything there at the center of it. It's especially frustrating when the ending comes with 20 minutes to go, and you don't even really feel the need to see what happens afterwards. Luckily, this film has a tremendous amount of visual style, and it's almost surprising to me that this was enough to make me enjoy the film, as I'm not always a big fan of the ""handheld camera"" thing when it comes to action films. In this case, however, the jolting camera was an important part of the action and of the character, such as it was. I think ultimately, this is a very forced sequel that doesn't justify its undoing of the last film's ending (while also relying too much on the audience's knowledge of its predecessor). Most of all, though, I think it's a pretty clear case of a good director, Paul Greengrass, having been saddled with a half-assed script.",The Bourne Supremacy

This is less of a sequel and more part two of a complete story. Matt Damon plays a vulnerable Bourne with humanity and empathy, which all lends to the believability of the character. The story is well thought through, leaving none of the gaping holes that are the hallmark of most action films. The dialogue is considered and realistic. It's also refreshing to see women treated as fully drawn characters, rather than pretty props. Worth watching just for the car chase, easily one of the best in film history.",The Bourne Supremacy
295,BuddyBoy1961,"Solid sequel, but did it HAVE to be shot in Shakyscope?",7,13 September 2004,"I can unquestionably say that by its end I had thoroughly enjoyed this sequel to (the better) ""The Bourne Identity"". But there were two factors that almost RUINED the movie for me (and they have been justifiably discussed below): the CONSTANTLY moving camera and the too-fast editing during action scenes. What was the director/editor thinking? ""Hey, if it works for Bruckheimer, it'll work for us!""? Did they ever stop to realize these are the two reasons why most of Bruckheimer's movies are AWFUL?! Even during scenes in ""Supremacy"" where two characters were absolutely motionless and merely having a conversation, the camera still meandered around the room, never stopping to register on a subtle expression here and there or on people's eyes. How was this ill-conceived ""technique"" ever born (no pun intended)? What moron ever thought for a moment that constantly moving the camera was a good idea? Were they afraid that audiences today had grown so jaded with time-tested cinematic grammar that they would flee movie theaters in droves? Hand-held camera work is fine for documentaries, out of necessity. But when it is so over-utilized in a theatrical film, it just translates to one thing and one thing only: the director has NO FAITH in the material. Did Greengrass never look at ""Bourne Identity"" to see how beautifully constructed it was?The action scenes in ""Supremacy"" were a joke. When will filmmakers understand that when said scenes are so chaotically edited together (see ""The Transporter"" as an example), the viewer's brain literally ""disconnects"" from the action; because there is too much information in too short a time to analyze adequately, it is impossible for the average film-goer to cognate and construct a linear visual narrative in their head. Consequently, the mind simply...gives up. The fight scene in the small apartment is a perfect example: all I could see were just two black blurs being tossed around for three minutes. Was I ever in the moment? No. Was I engaged? No. Was I empathetic to the hero? Uh...which one is the hero, I can't tell? I found myself actually looking away from the screen, I was so disinterested (more involuntarily than voluntarily).Whoever directs the next sequel, and I certainly hope it is NOT Greengrass, please do the following: learn as much as you can from Liman's success and Greengrass' blunders before you proceed. Millions of loyal Jason Bourne fans will thank you for it.",The Bourne Supremacy
296,TonyHurtado,"The Bourne Supremacy, a sequel that worked.",10,5 December 2010,"This wasn't my favorite film and or installment in the Bourne movies but it was still great. The BourneSupremacy answers some questions left unanswered in the first film. Although you won't know everything till you watch the third film. This film I think wasn't more on the action/adventure side and had more drama so the story could continue properly and as smooth as possible. The film I think was well shot, and even though Doug Liman did A great job on the first film I think Paul Greengrass the director of this film and Ultimatum. Paul has also directed Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and Green Zone. Paul got the opportunity to direct thee film because Liman left the project as director and became a producer for this film.This film also had another great car chase scene, which I thought was also the best scene in the film. Besides these car chases I love how faster, smarter, and more slick in this film after regaining some of his memory. The plot goes as this, after the first film, Bourne intends to leave his past of an assassin and lead a new life but, Ward Abbot (Brian Cox) frames Bourne for a murder so there would be no leads to him as an accomplice of TreadStone. After being framed and losing his girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente) he decides to hunt down anyone involved in framing him. He then runs into some new and past people like Nicky (Julia Stiles) and Pam Landey (Joan Allen) who thinks at first Bourne is the enemy but looks more into it to discover he isn't.There was one scene that they use also in The Bourne Ultimatum, same conversation and everything but, I'll get into to that in my next review. This movie really enticed people for Ultimatum to come out because, it is a semi cliff hanger, I'm not saying what it is you will have to watch it to find out. This movie was very creative and well written in a way that really makes you feel your in the movie. I also give this film a 10 out of 10 stars.",The Bourne Supremacy
297,fineanimal,The Bourne Disappointment,4,19 December 2004,"The Bourne Supremacy suffers from too much preoccupation with being ""stylish"" to be entertaining. Too many attempts to be ""cool"" kept pulling me away from the story and back to reality, where I had to face the sorry fact that I was watching a bad movie.You'd think by now Hollywood would figure out that the ""shaky camera"" bit is old, and that it was a dumb idea to begin with. Director Paul Greengrass explains in the features that the shaky camera was intended to evoke a ""visceral"" response from the viewer. But then again he'd have to say *something* to explain how such an expensive film could look so awful. I suppose the poor lighting had some artistic purpose also. Maybe I'm just not cool enough, but I would have preferred to be able to see what was going on instead. Most silent films had better lighting than this one.The technology gimmicks in the film were embarrassing to watch: computers that instantly call up every piece of information that exists in the world (at high resolution), two or three CIA voyeurs who can identify Jason Bourne on security cameras out of 200 million Europeans passing by, the rapid-fire typing of a court stenographer in the soundtrack every time someone is sitting at a computer. Hey Greengrass: if you want ""visceral"" reality, why don't you show the CIA sitting around watching the Windows hourglass on their monitors, or rebooting their computers every five minutes? The portrayal of high technology in this film wasn't interesting or entertaining at all. It was just plain silly.As near as I could tell there was a good car chase going on somewhere in the background while the camera was busy shaking and spinning around, not focusing on anything in particular. The only thing I recall about it was a motorcycle sliding rather gently beneath a car, but I'm not sure whether this had anything to do with Bourne, the story, or anything else. The editing was that bad (or was it ""visceral""?).The good news is Matt Damon and Julia Stiles' performances--especially when Stile's character fears for her life. Unfortunately, their efforts were wasted on this film due to the shaky-cam, bad lighting, and poor editing. Joan Allen's character was a Royal b*tch, so if you like that kind of thing, there you go. Otherwise, she'll probably just p*ss you off. And don't expect a whole lot of action in this film. There's a lot of *movement* due to the shaky camera, but very little action for an action film. And Damon himself has about as many action scenes as Walter Matthou did in Grumpy Old Men, unless you consider walking down the street quickly to be an action sequence.Finally, each DVD special feature ends with a brief advertisement for... the DVD you are already watching. Are the filmmaker's really that sloppy, or was this too meant to evoke some kind of ""visceral"" reaction? If so, they succeeded, because I feel sick after watching this film. It is nowhere near as good as the Bourne Identity.4/10",The Bourne Supremacy

It is not fighting with everybody and killing them hand to hand combat. The way that makes one as a warrior is seeing the future. Doing things considering future.The best war is the one that is won without it ever happens. Another good point is the character here cannot escape this destiny.The train scene and a lot of other scenes not only real from martial arts perspective as design but also considering the qualities of ""clever"" warrior. Unlike other films, the agent in this film is really capable of the format of ""thinking"".The only scene that made me think about is the ""girl"" scene that whether Bourne has to give the gun to girl or not.The great series.

This movie is definitely superior to the first (I don't know if you can say that about the books) but I really enjoyed this movie. I was hyped up when I saw the previews even though I remembered Identity and how I didn't like it too much. I still went and saw it and it was great. Matt Damon does an even better job as Bourne going into another serious role and stepping away from comedy (Stuck on You) I felt this movie delivered more in terms of uncovering Bourne's past and giving Bourne a little more depth and a little more edge. This guy is evenly matched with Bond IMO. The supporting cast was great because we got to see some old faces that make this movie connect with the first one. The action sequences are a step up here too. I also enjoy John Powell's dramatic music to really add to the movie. I don't know if Ultimatum will be as good because of a certain thing that happens.

The car chase in Moscow must rank among the most violent ever filmed. Are these Russian cars really built like tanks?Flaws, inter alia:1) The camera work: the director overdid the 'shaky' bits. First, it make you nauseous when you're exposed to it on a large screen (and I saw it on a LARGE screen). It's OK for TV and NYPD, but not here. The nausea plus the overuse of the effect diminishes its impact in those instances where it could have been useful. It was a lousy directorial decision.2) Why did they have to kill off Marie? To motivate Bourne? Cliché, and in your face - and that basically means crappy, lazy story-telling. I could think off-hand of at least five other, less stereotypical, ways of achieving the same aim; can't you? Or was it just because the screenwriters didn't know what to do with the romance angle? Does God exist? Who invented the doggy-bag? Some questions have no answers, I guess.Never mind.

302,Bob_647,Green Grass hurtles you through this paced up sequel.,8,6 June 2020,"Paul Green Grass steps in the director's chair, with his quintessentially action film octane buff & thrilling direction style. The film picks up a style of its own. It would replicate this in the third installment the Bourne Ultimatum. It chiefly involves shaky camera, close camera angles, & fast choppy editing in perfect synchronicity with the series' awe sound.The casting is still great, with Matt Damon bringing a dead pan portrayal to the Bourne character. Hes very good in this role, which commits a great success to the whole of the movie. Supporting players Brian Cox and Julia Styles, along with newcomer Joan Allen, all provide stellar support for Bourne. The action is intense and really well done, and the plot is thrilling and will surprise you quite a bit.The movie is assembled from standard thriller ingredients, and hurtles from one action sequence to another in India and Europe, with cuts to parallel action in Washington and New York. What distinguishes it is Bourne's inventiveness. There's a scene where he takes about four seconds to disable an armed agent and steal his cell phone contact list, and you're thinking, this is a guy who knows what he's doing. And how about the innovative use he finds for a toaster? It's neat to see him read a situation and instantaneously improvise a response, often by using lateral thinking.The camera work is extremely fast paced, and overall it has a gritty, captivating style. The camera is unstable. It was obviously done intentionally by design choice, but not excessively overdone. Through action scenes that had you at the edge of your seat, you'd just come to realize that you can see what the heck is going on. This makes these scenes easy to enjoy. But not only was it the action scenes; even during quiet still scenes the camera would always seem to be moving. Just to serve as a warning, it's pretty much like that throughout most of the movie, so brace yourself for an adventure of epic proportions.We have a pretty good idea, long before anyone else does, because the movie observes the Law of Economy of Character Development, which teaches us that when an important actor is used in an apparently subordinate role, he's the villain. But the movie doesn't depend on its big revelations for its impact; the mystery is not why Bourne is targeted, but whether he will die. He survives one lethal trap or ambush after another, leaping off bridges, crashing cars, killing assailants, and finally limping a little after a chase that should have killed him.Because it's plot heavy, The Bourne Supremacy requires the viewer to watch, and the large amount of talking goes some way to distancing this from most other action movies. However, this could also be seen as a good point as it can not, at times, hinder the movie in the excitement stakes and make it easy viewing for those that do like their action. The movie spans across Europe to a number of different countries including Germany, Britain, France and Russia and this keeps it exciting as it allows the landscape of the movie to change constantly and the film doesn't dwell in the same area. In fact, the film is very efficient on the whole and it never overindulges in anything, which compensates for the amount of talking and allows it to be exciting. Despite it being more stealthy than most, time is still found for a number of high-octane sequences including fist fights, explosions and the great car chase that looks as if it could have been lifted straight out of Grand Theft Auto.With all of these elements together, you got one great action thriller that in many cases even surpasses Identity! Movies like this are hard to come by, in todays times with many action pictures that just don't work and become tedious. Definitely see The Bourne Identity before this don't fret: you will be very entertained.",The Bourne Supremacy

304,garboventures,"Overall, a fine sequel",7,29 January 2005,"The Bourne Supremacy is a fine sequel movie albeit a little confusing in terms of plot and overall narrative structure. Like many others I too was annoyed at the early killing off of Marie, and on first viewing, the re-calibration of Jason as a lone, ruthless and tragic killer seeking revenge seemed a bit trite to me. This made me 'miss' the first film, with its air of wintry mystery and suspense, and of course the love affair which feels so sincere and under-stated between Jason and Marie. But on subsequent viewing I can now see that the franchise would have ground to an early halt with Marie still alive, as the idea of their constantly being on the run from those intent on killing Bourne would have had less and less mileage over time. There are now many more possibilities for further plot developments. Where the film fails is in explaining the back-story of Treadstone - its purpose, power relations, corruption. A deleted scene on the DVD serves a better purpose here than the film itself does in explaining the link between corrupt CIA operatives and corrupt Russian oligarchs. It is not necessary of course to have the plot spelt out in stark terms, but a little more clarity would have been appreciated at some points. The settings were excellent and the look and feel of location shots very effective - although it was annoying that the European scenes were gritty and darkly-lit but New York City is awash with clean bright light. Much of the acting was impressive stuff - Joan Allen (and her character Pamela Landy) were excellent and her verbal face-off with Brian Cox (Abbott) was superb. Matt Damon as Jason Bourne was fabulous - the secret to this franchise's success is surely Bourne himself; he is dark and conflicted, a controlled cauldron of emotion, guilt, fear and pain, and unpredictable, as we are never entirely sure of his motivations, his direction - and yet we still feel tremendous empathy for him. This is partly due to the writing of his character, but Damon has to take the lion's share of the credit for Bourne's weighty presence and the films' success. For me, the most striking aspect of the film was the music soundtrack - winsome, dynamic, harsh, melodious, staccato, active - and silence is used appropriately too. Bourne's final meeting with the Russian girl is suitably still, not sentimental. As for the much-maligned camera-work under Greengrass's direction, certainly there is something a little arrogant, even over-reaching in its desperation to be so 'real' - but there are many more truly fine moments. The final car chase does work, but the best moments are those where Greengrass captures stillness, quiet. Brian Cox in Berlin, a brooding, guilty presence in shadow while the CIA 'hub' office is racked with activity. Jason Bourne washing his hands in a public toilet, glancing nervously at his face in the mirror. Marie's death, as Bourne kisses her, and she drifts silently away underwater. Bourne walking away from the car crash at the end of the Moscow chase scene into a pool of light beyond the dark tunnel.",The Bourne Supremacy

But at the end of that movie, you kind of got the idea that Bourne settled down with the lady of his dreams and lived happily ever after. This sequel, The Bourne Supremacy, had to untie the nice ending of the first flick to make a bunch of loose ends, which it then proceeded to tie together again by the end of this movie.That's ok, though. It made for a really cool action flick, complete with car chases, crashes, foot chases, fights, and lots of shooting. That on top of the mystery and intrigue. There were two things I didn't care for, however. One was that Julia Stiles' part was too small - again. Most importantly, however, is that the cinematography was absolutely horrid. It looked like a home video, especially during the fight scenes and car chases. It made my head spin, and there was no way to visually keep up with the action. Even during the office sequences, the images were blurred and shaky. I guess they figured they wouldn't need to hire a choreographer for the fight sequences if only the camera were shaky enough to disguise all the mistakes of the actors.That said, I still highly recommend the movie if you like action and mystery.

Yes, I threw that in just to feel worldly. I confess.Plot: It's a fine plot, nothing really wrong, though I do question a few things that I won't mention here. Don't worry, it's small stuff.Script: I liked the script. This movie gives you some fresh dialog in places where other movies give bloated, cheesy, wordy goo. I wish there was more original material, but that's ok.Cinematography: The camera work was a bit of an issue for me. In some parts of the film it worked very well giving the viewer a sense of motion and speed and a feeling of loss of control, loss of spacial awareness. In other cases, it was obvious that the operator was shaking the camera like a baby's rattle. Hey, it worked for Blair Witch Project, mostly, and it works here, mostly.Techy stuff: Ok, I somehow managed to ignore most of the high technology presented in the film, so they must have done a better job than most films. So, thumbs up for technical presentation I guess.You know what I mean: a typical 'movie' computer makes about 20 unique noises per minute, processing, downloading, uploading, thinking, burping. Imagine sitting at the terminal for 8 hours hearing bleeps, bloops, swishes, dings, and blips. Now add that to all the other computers around you. Yeah, somehow most directors think we're stupid. Considering that many of us use computers daily, and those computers make no noise at all, it's surprising. Why can't they use a more realistic set of sounds, like a person saying ""C'mon process my stupid request for crying out loud!"" while the computer SILENTLY does its work. Or someone telling a stupid joke, or nervously tapping a pencil. Oh, and don't get me started about fancy red blinking ACCESS DENIED windows. Oh man. But I digress.Overall, this is a refreshing intrigue/drama/action movie. If going to see an action film makes you feel dirty, rest assured, you will feel squeaky clean after this one.9/10",The Bourne Supremacy
312,Moonhawk1975,Fast-paced sequel succeeds as equal to original,10,8 April 2005,"After regaining his memory and settling his complicated affairs, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) has holed away in an island paradise intent on setting up a new life with Marie (Franka Potente). We are quickly brought back into the life of these characters and are shocked at the events which (too) quickly follow. Circumstances again throw Bourne back into his former life as he must prove his innocence.Wonderful action sequences are everywhere in this movie. Director Paul Greengrass sets them up wonderfully and executes them with near-perfection. My only complaints lie with the camera work; it's far too shaky. Face it, Hollywood. No matter what you attempt you can not make a movie look like anything but. Ditch the handhelds and go back to nice, clean, steady shotsyou know, the kind that actually allows you to see and comprehend the action. I was very frustrated with this, as there were times it was difficult to tell what was happening. Of course, this has been a common occurrence for about the last ten years.That aside, this movie is as engaging as the original was a surprise. Joan Allen is excellent, as always, as the agent tracking Bourne. Matt Damon is just as good here, trying to determine who is setting him up and why, as he was the first time around, frantically trying to recovery his memory to determine why people were trying to kill him. I was so wrapped up in the movie, I was surprised to see it end. It reaches its conclusion in a rather low-key fashion, after a breathtaking chase through the streets of Moscow. I can't wait to see what this character will run into next.",The Bourne Supremacy
313,mike683,I saw Bourne...yesterday,8,26 July 2004,"Supremacy is an efficient sequel to ""The Bourne Identity"". The sophisticated talents of the cast supplement the stability of this action-packed series. I really love the way you vicariously live in Jason Bourne's shoes from the movie's beginning to end. The car chase scenes rival, if not exceed, other greats like in 'Bullitt' or ""The French Connection', and the hand-to-hand battles are first rate.It may not closely follow the Ludlum book, but director Paul Greengrass still manages to fit the pieces of this thriller together nicely. Overall, this movie is a pleasure for action movie lovers and I would definitely say it deserves it's nearly 8 point IMDb rating.",The Bourne Supremacy
314,dianefhlbsch,The best of the trilogy,9,25 May 2009,"You know you were sort of a bad guy, who now just wants to be a regular guy. But can you make the transition and put the pieces together - and will ""they"" let you? This is the best of the three movies for drama. It's intense and gritty. The hand held cameras add so much to the visual effect. Jason Bourne is a flawed hero, which is much easier to empathize with. But the action is overdone. He has undergone severe behavior modification, but he's NOT superman! It would have been more powerful with less extravagant chases, explosions and the like.We also get to revisit with some old characters in new ways, and meet a few new ones too. (And contrary to listings Julia Stiles does NOT play Bourne's girlfriend!)",The Bourne Supremacy
315,shaidarharan,Would've given it a 10 but for the shaky fight scene,9,24 July 2004,"Being familiar with another of the director's movies, bloody sunday, I can say this too is a great movie marred only by a couple occurrences of overzealous camera style, particularly the shaky/jerky/odd angle camera work during a hand to hand battle.  The audible audience (around me) seemed confused as to what was going on.  My companions and I preferred the first movies close combat better.  Aside from that, a great movie that keeps one riveted throughout.  10/10 - 1 for bizarre fight camera = 9/10I am eagerly awaiting Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Ultimatum, seeing how both this and the last movie delivered a range of characters, car chases, gun, knives, hand-to-hand, and bas rutton's favorite - ambiance- combat, all tied with an attention to logic and detail.  A very enjoyable theater experience that will likely earn Bourne Supremacy a place on my shelf.",The Bourne Supremacy
316,fluffyclown,"Good script, good acting, what could go wrong?",8,24 July 2004,"******* WARNING: SPOILERS *******There are two things I usually like to harp on about movies these days. Poor scripts and bad acting. For the first time in my film reviewing career, I can honestly say that I have nothing to gripe about with either of the aspects with The Bourne Supremacy.Having remembered the characters from The Bourne Identity, I was anxious too see how they had changed or moved on in the last two years. I wasn't disappointed. Seeing Jason struggle with his headaches and nightmares, still unable to piece together the lost years of his life was touching, and immediately pulled me in and got me interested. You could plainly see that his love for Marie was the only thing keeping him together, and keeping him going. Then a-whamma-bamma-boom! Jason is set up for a crime he did not commit, and his beloved Marie is gone. So, what does he do? Exactly what he said he would do in the first film. He goes right to his accusers front door and shoves it right back down their throats. The tag-line was right; they should have left him alone! Step by step we see Jason battle with his fellow patriots, his inner demons, and his enemies. It all leads up to a climactic high-speed chase through the streets of Moscow, and a life and death confrontation between Jason and Marie's killer. The moment that passes between them speaks on so many levels, as Jason realizes; this nemesis was only doing the exact same thing that he had been trained to do. I was truly impressed. I loved the character change in Jason because of his love for Marie, and the ending leaves you guessing when and where he will turn up next. The script and the plot were solid, the film was well-paced, and the character development was outstanding. And get this, there was little if any profanity in this film, and no long, drawn out sex scenes. Wow! A well-scripted, well-characterized, well-paced action film with no profanity and no sex. I loved it!I also loved, (and this takes me a lot to admit) Matt Damon as Jason Bourne.I thought he did a good job in Identity, but in Supremacy, he nailed it. Everything he did in this film convinced me that no other actor could have filled this character's shoes but him, and this is high praise considering the onslaught I usually dish out at male lead characters in action films. In fact, I don't really have anything negative to say about any of the cast.They all did their characters justice, and then some. Bravo, Joan Allen, Albert Finney, Julia Stiles, and so on. You all did a great job!But, there were some major problems with The Bourne Supremacy. The camera work and editing. Now I am all for creative cinematography, but what's with all the sloppy hand-held shots, the out-of-focus shots, and the badly cropped shots? And what's with all the jump cuts during the action sequences? Yes, when used correctly, the combination of these shots and edits can make for some interesting film sequences, that I admit. But there was just so much of it in this film that it left the me feeling slightly disoriented after each scene, and headachey by the film's end. The first scene with Jason and Marie is a perfect example. This is a beautiful scene, in which Jason expresses his love and devotion to Marie. The hand-held shots is this scene were so bad they completely distracted the viewer from the intimacy of the scene. And the jump cuts during the action sequences were so jarring and so numerous, that the viewer was dizzy and confused by the end of them. I mean, when you are watching a high-speed chase, the jerky movements caused by the action itself is enough to give a hair raising effect. But adding in montages of jump cuts full of out of focus shots and jerky hand held shots on top of it is just overkill. At times I felt like I was watching a student film made by and overly ambitious freshman cinematographer that was trying to impress the professor by throwing in every different type of eye-catching shot they could think of. Comon' folks! We invented tripods for a reason! Overall, I thought this was an excellent character-driven action film (yes, they do exist) with a great script and some outstanding performances. If I could rank it by these two aspects only, I would give it a 10. But, since all aspects must be accounted for, I find I cannot. So, take some tylenol or advil with you so you aren't completely disoriented and headachey by the end of the film, and you should have a great time.My rank: 8/10",The Bourne Supremacy
317,toddinvestor,Big disappointment,3,26 July 2004,"After enjoying ""The Bourne Identity"" and hearing some good reviews about this film, I went in expected to be impressed. Instead, what a letdown! ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is an instantly forgettable film not even worth renting never mind the price of admission. This boring movie fails to produce a plot, character or theme worth caring about. The story is unoriginal, slow moving and far fetched. One of the most ridiculous repeated scenes is Matt Damon always magically ending up in the antagonist's house, bedroom or adjacent window. How he gets there, no one knows. Be careful next time you come home. Matt Damon might be in your kitchen eating milk and cookies! Matt Damon's character Bourne is also uninteresting. He barely utters a word in the whole film. And yes, we got it already, he has amnesia. Add to all of this an annoying, blurry, rapid, shaky directing style throughout the movie. The director even manages to ruin the one exciting car chase scene. They should have ended this series after the first film. Avoid. 3/10",The Bourne Supremacy

Amazing carnage and property damage.",The Bourne Supremacy
319,janusswti,Sequel better than original,9,10 July 2021,I have read the book. I have seen the old movie (Chamberlane main role) and the Identity. It is almost very rare for a sequel to hook you and make you feel better than the original. But this is one of the few exceptions.The supremacy title says it all!!! Of all the four movies this is the best.And i only give it 9 stars and not 10 because in my opinion the director messed the action scenes. Don't shake the camera so much dude!Anyway! 9/10 and i always enjoy watching it again and again. It strikes back at me. Like another movie....,The Bourne Supremacy
320,ProphetTenebrae,Bourne Supremacy = Bourne Identity - Good Bits,5,19 June 2005,"A lot of people saw the Bourne Identity as an edgy new approach to the whole spy film - more realistic, less glitzy, a lot more grit and conforming to a far more minimalist approach. Very little dialogue, just a lot of tension and suspense with a lot of action.In many ways - the Supremacy follows this same kind of style in a similar fashion but misses out the crucial elements that made the original so great to watch.First off - the action scenes are likely to induce epileptic fits in some viewers. The movement and cutting is THAT fast. In the original Bourne could explode into action and sure the editing wasn't great but it gave the desired effect. Here it just looks as though they couldn't be bothered spending the time filming an action scene worth watching, which is greatly to the detriment of the film.Secondly, Bourne is essentially on his own for the whole movie. As he doesn't talk to himself and we don't hear any of his thoughts, there is barely any dialogue except for the banal ramblings of the people out to get Bourne and the whole thing gets rather too much into the generic government conspiracy type vein.Thirdly and finally - it's just so boring to watch Bourne run around looking somewhere between constipated and angry for the whole film. He doesn't have anyone to confide in, to unload on. So he becomes a rather dull and uninteresting, if ass-kicking character.Then magically all evil-doers are taken care of, Bourne escapes again and so on, to live on in sequels to come. All in all the film just feels as though someone copied and pasted from the original but without any real thought or attention to detail. Hence you have a cookie-cutter sequel that lacks the charm of the original.10",The Bourne Supremacy
321,kenobi7,An extremely underrated - and awesome - action thriller.,9,10 June 2013,"As we all know, it is not very often that a sequel outdoes its predecessor. The Bourne franchise is not usually mentioned in this type of conversation, but Supremacy is a good example of it. Everything from the story, to the action, to the acting, to the intrigue, is kicked up a notch. The film brings Bourne into the proceedings while he is trying to enjoy an extended period of hiding with Marie from the agencies that are seeking to eliminate him. But, all good things must come to an end. Jason begins having terrible dreams, featuring quick bursts of scenes from his past, which of course he doesn't remember ever occurring. The CIA has found someone new to headline the tracking down of Bourne following Conklin's death in Identity. This is Pamela Landy, who is refreshingly all business, but very practical and rational. She is obviously the one best suited for the job, in that she can match anything Bourne can throw at them. But there is deadly intrigue in Landy's ranks also, in the form of Ward Abbott, Conklin's former boss. Since Conklin's death, he has seemingly thought it was all over because Bourne was dead or no longer a problem. Not so. Someone has framed two murders and the intentional botching of a CIA operation in Berlin on Bourne. He comes out of the shadows on a totally separate mission of vengeance, but before long, is drawn into an ever-so convoluted mission of clearing his name and figuring out how it all connects to his very first mission as an agent. As part of this, new -to-the-franchise director Paul Greengrass puts his own spin on the proceedings. His hyper-quick editing (especially during the action scenes) has been strongly criticized, but as I have mentioned before, I actually enjoy it. The editing gives the audience (and Bourne, presumably) the feeling of not knowing what's going on. Bourne is still suffering from amnesia, so he still doesn't really know where his training stems from. His reactions during such situations are only known to him, and we don't usually figure out what he's doing until it's already done. Bourne is not at all predictable or contrived as a character, which makes him so charismatic and easy to sympathize with. He doesn't truthfully know why or how he does what he does, he just does it. Therefore, during the action scenes, if one considers themselves a true fan, they must jump in and hang on for dear life. All the performances are terrific, with each one of the cast members getting at least one scene where they are allowed to shine. Supremacy is what results when we have seen Identity, and are therefore no longer needing introductions. We (somewhat) know who the characters are and what their involvement is in the story, and are now ready to get down to business. Supremacy is an amazing and ridiculously intense thriller, and I'm here to tell you - don't believe the detractors of the film or franchise until you watch it for yourself.",The Bourne Supremacy
322,sakulin,Eye Candy for Violence Addicts,3,15 June 2005,"SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS Another Hollywood exercise in gratuitous violence. Entertaining perhaps but a tad tedious. A formula flick. We know immediately that the girl is going to get whacked. And we also know that one of the main bad guys is a CIA insider. Matt appears to have all the tools at the perfect time. He just "" happened"" to have a license plate in his bag of tricks, a mind-boggling supply of tools to perform his deeds, and an endless supply of money. He was fluent in God knows how many languages and how can any human take such physical punishment and keep walking. He never ate, never slept, never went to the john. If he was so smart why didn't he take a time out to disguise himself. Even a Groucho mask.And the ending. Give me a break. The endless car chase. Get it over with. Haven't we seen this before? Maybe a thousand times? And no automobile can take that kind of punishment and keep rolling.A few days before watching this crap I had seen a beautiful Chinese flick called ""The Way Home"". No violence and just nice people. And prior to that a fantastic Spanish production ""Talk to Her"". Why can't Hollywood make thoughtful movies like these? I suppose that Bourne is a reflection of our violent society.This was a waste of my time.",The Bourne Supremacy
323,jiujitsu_jesus,A brilliant - yet doomed - spy drama,10,19 December 2004,"The continuation of the new-age adaption of Robert Ludlum's most acclaimed trilogy is one of those rare sequels that strides head and shoulders above its predecessor. Director Paul Greengrass, who takes the reins from Doug Liman, skilfully incorporates into the movie a new dimension of heightened emotion, to supplement the mood of nail-biting suspense established in THE BOURNE IDENTITY. The plot is even more elaborately gripping, the character development is far more in-depth, and the cinematography is nothing short of outstanding. Overall, the film builds on the strengths of its predecessor, manifesting itself as a well-rounded and superbly entertaining movie as well as a beautiful piece of film-making.Matt Damon returns as Jason Bourne, the amnesiac ex-CIA-assassin who is trying to escape the phantoms of his largely unknown past by hiding out in Goa with his wife, Marie (Franka Potente). The peace is soon shattered when an enigmatic gunman (Karl Urban) tracks him down and murders Marie, prompting Bourne to once again become the feared assassin in order to exact revenge. Meanwhile, CIA officer Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), taking over from the murdered Alexander Conklin (see the first film), discovers a trail that leads her to Bourne, but her dodgy colleague Abbot (Brian Cox) seems to be intentionally barring her way with red tape. Waiting in the wings is a shifty Russian oil tycoon (Karel Roden), who seems to be the employer of Marie's killer. The plot unfolds with perfect precision and logic, and the pace rarely flags.Although the Bourne saga is far from over in the telling, with Bourne's true identity tantalisingly revealed at the end of this film, we cannot expect a sequel anytime soon - I read somewhere that lead actor Matt Damon announced that he is not interested in filming a third installment (a new actor for Bourne would be impossible to justify in the script). However, this will hopefully encourage fans of the movies to plunge into the superior intricacy and suspense of Ludlum's novels.CORRECTION: Forget the first sentence of the last paragraph - THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM has been announced!

In ""Supremacy,"" he wears the same black coat for most of the picture.A one point, Nicky says, ""They don't make mistakes."" Yeah, right.... When he goes to the hotel where Neski was shot, he doesn't know his picture has been circulated to the press, and consequently, when the politzi arrive, and he starts running, they pick him up outside the hotel walking on the crowded street, initiating an elaborate chase sequence.Of course, if he had a hat, there wouldn't be an elaborate chase sequence.And, I assume that if they film the other books in this series, he won't wear a hat then, even if it's raining.",The Bourne Supremacy
325,furex,Dull story with overdone camera work,4,15 May 2007,"The Bourne Supremacy is a pretty average story, one you have probably seen dozens of times already.Matt Damon - once a spy - is now a man that remembers little about his past; he is forced to go back into action when a Russian hit-man murders his girlfriend while trying to take him out. He obviously wants to find out why someone wanted him dead, and he soon realizes he has CIA on his tail, too.This pretty basic one-man-army against the whole world tale, one you would have called trite and under average, is spiced up by frantic editing and epileptic camera work, which require the viewer to keep his/her eyes glued to the screen just to follow the simplest of actions.While hand-camera has been used to great effect in many other movies, this one is just plain overdone. A lot of work and effort (and money) has been put in the making of this film, but this does not save it from its own mediocrity. I would be almost tempted to say the director overdone it willingly, to try and conceal the low quality of his source material, confuse the viewers and eventually trick them into thinking it is actually 'cutting-edge'.",The Bourne Supremacy

Curious, because there's plenty of excitement here, if only one could bring it into focus. I became increasingly annoyed by the unrelenting lurching, until I realized it looked like ""subspace turbulence"" from the 1960's Star Trek, then I found it somewhat amusing (perhaps not the effect they were going for). Just as in the first film, not much of the story is from Ludlum's novel, though maybe that's not such a bad thing - you can enjoy both the book and the movie, since they're not too closely related. Bring your Dramamine/Bonine, sit in the back, and you'll probably enjoy Matt Damon's hairbreadth escapes.",The Bourne Supremacy

The Bourne Suprmacy follows up on its prequel The Bourne Identity in perfect fashion. What makes this movie excellent is that it kept the same ingredients as first movie. Much like the Lord of the Rings trilogy, if you liked the first one, you'll want the next one. The Bourne Identity captured Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) trying to figure out who he was. He accomplished that. In this movie, he tries to put the pieces of his slight memories together to figure out just what he did.

The cinematography done by Oliver Wood is astounding; keeping mostly to hand-held moving with the actor's holding the tempo of the film especially high. Matt Damon brings Jason Bourne back to life with a seamless transition from Identity to Supremacy. Unlike some films where the actors fail to hold their character, together Damon stays true. Stiles Cox and Allen put in fantastic performances, keeping their interactions tight with the same accuracy, proof of great direction from Paul Greengrass. The dialog delivered by the entire cast is very well timed with meticulous detail again staying true to Identity. Karl Urban is somewhat under used as a nemesis who could have given much more energy to his character if given the time to develop. Supremacy ran with a colder feel keeping the film a touch darker with a certain bitterness that underlies the entire film.

Yeah I know there was shaky camera-work but who cares, I didn't let it affect my understanding of what was going on. Many have suggested that this put them off the movie, but I thought it a good exercise in making your brain work a bit harder, with your eyes whizzing around attempting to capture what the camera is trying to tell you.

I read the book - this isn't even close. And, as a movie, where's the plot? 90 minutes (not 2 hours, 1 1/2 hours) of excitement and thrill, but too many missing pieces and again, nothing to do w/the book.

I've never been a fan of movies in which the camera bounces around to create the feeling of greater action and heightened intensity, but despite the use of that tactic, 'Supremacy' worked for me in every way. Matt Damon came back to the role he was born to play and killed again (so to speak), his motivation was different but just as believable, and his choices and actions were just as entertaining and awe-inspiring as in 'Identity' and, also as in 'Identity', the story hooks you in right from the start and doesn't let go. You can't help but root for the good guy in his quest to learn about his past and secure peace in his future.In a movie that takes what should be unbelievable and makes you believe it possible extremely well, my only complaint with the story is that no one, even Jason Bourne, would walk away from a head on collision with a cement wall at full speed in a little cardboard box of a car without a seat belt on with only a slight limp. As for my rating, it comes in about a little less than half a point below 'Identity' (which I gave 8.6) but still a solid 8+. Final tally: 8.2 But that's just my two scents. ;)",The Bourne Supremacy

It was as if the movie was shot by a nervous cameraman with horrible balance and was edited by somebody with ADD.The car chase sequences suffer the most.  You watch minutes of action and become kind of numb.

I can only surmise that we slept through it, because renting the DVD this week for a second viewing was a HUGE mistake! What an awful movie! First, as commented upon elsewhere here, director Greengrass must have had a nerve problem because the camera is whipped around so fast for any scene where the characters are actually moving as to make it almost unintelligible as to what is occurring. What was he thinking? This is NOT the way to film a motion picture. The characters and the cars, etc. are supposed to do the moving, not the camera! Second, the writing was pitiful. Did Matt Damon ever utter more than three sentences at a time? There was a plot in there somewhere, but the writing was so poor that nothing any of the characters said did much to advance that ""plot."" An hour into the story you were still wondering ""what is going on here?"" And soon that changed to, ""I really don't care what is going on here."" Pick up the pace guys, this is supposed to be an action/thriller movie, not a sleepwalk! Third, the cinematography was extremely underlit for every indoor scene. This is NOT a film noir, yet it was lit as if it were one. No matter how I massaged my TV and DVD video controls, the indoor scenes seemed as if they were shot in a coal mine. You combine that with the camera whipping around and you wonder how Paul Greengrass ever escaped television directing, let alone do something as acclaimed as United 93.This is one of the most disappointing ""big name"" movies I can recall. Avoid it like the plague!",The Bourne Supremacy
337,saykeng,The Power of Observation keeps Jason Bourne ahead of his predators...,9,12 August 2006,"The Bourne Identity & The Bourne Supremacy As a strategy consultant, & whenever I go to the movies (or watch movies at home), I often take the opportunity to seek out possibilities of using them to teach life (survival) skills to participants in my seminars & workshops.The two Bourne movies, namely Bourne Identity & Bourne Supremacy, are two great examples.Both movies are loosely based on Robert Ludlum's work, which included The Rheinmann Exchange, The Osterman Weekend & the Holcroft Covenant. They have also been made into great movies.In the first movie, with the opening scene: An unconscious young man is pulled out off the Mediterranean coast by a fishing boat one stormy night. Thinking that the young man is dead, a curious fisherman with a scalpel finds two bullets in his back & a microchip in his hip. The chip reveals a Swiss bank account. But our wet hero isn't dead but realises that he has amnesia. He then rushes to Zurich. In the bank vault, he discovers his name, Jason Bourne (played by Mark Damon). In addition, he finds a baffling pile of different passports, all with his picture, and a large chunk of cash. In the US Embassy, he bumps into Marie (played by Franka Potente), along with the fact that someone wants to kill him. Armed with a bag of money and superb martial arts skills, & with Marie by his side, he scours Paris for clues about his identity and past life...& finds himself in the middle of two assassination plots (one assassin was played by Clive Owen, as 'The Professor') masterminded by rouge elements of the CIA.In the second movie, with the opening scene, continuing from the first movie: Jason Bourne is recovering in Goa, India with Marie. He spots a mysterious dark-glassed man with the wrong clothes while jogging. He escapes with Marie but she is shot in the ensuing chase. The next scene shows CIA operatives under deputy director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) conducting a sting operation to fish out a mole in CIA but something goes wrong. Her subsequent investigation leads to the highly-classified Treadstone project, which apparently involves Jason Bourne. She even finds evidence that Bourne is behind what happened to her botched operation. So Bourne sets out to clear his name. The remaining part of the movie shows Bourne outsmarting CIA operatives - & the assassin (played menacingly by Karl Urban as Kirill) - & tracking down the rogue elements in the CIA with shady connections to the Russian mob, who have jointly framed him in the first place.In the two movies, Jason Bourne demonstrates his uncanny ability to observe & pay attention to what's around him - note: notice the exceptions in the details of the environment - which allows him to constantly stay ahead of his predators & at the same time, stay agile (mentally & physically) to anticipate dangers & get out of precarious situations.For example...remember the scene in the second movie...after he had jogged at the beach, he observed a dark-glassed man whose clothing & behaviour somehow did not match the environment...His ability to stay calm, size up dangerous situations & come up with super-quick, innovative solutions to escape from capture is well demonstrated in both movies.For example...remember the scene in the first movie, where he jumped down several storeys with a dead body as cushion while blasting his gun at his assassins running up the staircase...the scene in the second movie, where he improvised a weapon out of rolled newspapers & an explosive escape using a magazine stuffed into a burning toaster in a quickly engineered gas-filled room...Wow! that was great! Naturally, I am also fascinated by the many unique fighting sequences (particularly the one within a tight environment in the second movie), car chases, cat & mouse games, etc. in both movies.Additionally, what I like about both movies is the total absence of super-duper gadgets commonly found in such spy-thriller movies. Jason Bourne used only his sheer human ingenuity & creativity to outsmart his enemies.To end my review, I must add that I have enjoyed watching both movies, experientially as well as educationally.",The Bourne Supremacy
338,ilovelctr,"Awesome plot, storytelling and some standout logical stuff but not as good as the other two",8,7 August 2010,"The Bourne Supremacy is the least favorite Bourne film of mine so far (you know there's gonna be a forth one). But it still stands higher than most action thrillers out there today.One of the improvements that I really appreciate from it is the bigger amount of scenes that show us Jason Bourne's incredibly high IQ. Scenes such as the trick where Bourne gets to know Pamela Landy's room number secretly and the Berlin foot chase where Jason escapes the police in a very intelligent way are definitely highlights. And they're generally the things we, ordinary people, are able to do, despite the fact that most of us can't bring ourselves to such intelligent solutions. The final car chase in Moscow is also one of the best in movie history in my opinion, which is better than the overrated one in The Dark Knight as I believe.As for the story, it's highly logical and intellectual, aside from only one minor plot hole where we've no idea how that happens (how Jason finds the only alive Treadstone operative besides himself hasn't been explained). Some people found the plot hard to follow, while for me, it's very well written. And depending on your taste, you might prefer it to the story of the first one or not.However, there are certain things that keep it from being an excellent film like The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Ultimatum. First, it lacks the adequate amount of action sequences that keep viewers' eyes glued to the big screen. Also, though I'm by no means an opponent of shaky camera work, it's obviously been overused in this film. In general they don't bother me, but that supposed-to-be-gorgeous martial-arts combat was terribly ruined by this method of shooting. Apart from this one, there're also some weak moments like the car chase in India and the tram scene. The ending of the movie, though not cliffhanger, kind of has an unfinished sense; thus by watching that you'd hunger for a sequel. Above are the factors making this a lesser movie than the other two in the series IMO.The character development on the other hand is well arranged. Bad guys in this film are shown as being corrupted and the motivation for the way they act is believable. While it's less emotional than its predecessor, that however adds to the film-noir style it delivers, which definitely works for its own good.8.0/10",The Bourne Supremacy
339,Naoum,They should have left him alone alright!,5,8 February 2005,"Only minor spoiler herein...The tagline for the movie is that they should have left him alone and that goes for everyone else (apart from who they are referring to) I guess.The first movie was a suspense movie. It had its action pauses and the thing I missed was the intuition of Bourne to danger. In the first movie he was able to ""foresee"" into the future through interpreting the signs. Something would be missing from the big picture and he knew what was wrong. That only happens in the beginning of the movie and it doesn't feel right, as if there is something missing from the recipe of success. Bourne has changed which one might expect but I don't thing they truly knew what he was then and what he is now. A rather random shift...I saw in the extras of the DVD that they wanted to make something of a documentary-like movie but that camera was down right hard to watch... I believe it was superficially or awkwardly experimental if you like.There were some things in the plot that were hard to believe but I won't go into them not to spoil anything, but I can say this: ""They make Russian cars very sturdy these days""...Too much of a macho where it wasn't like that according to my opinion. And the ""excuse me but I murdered some chaps"" scene was laughable. Pleeeeeeeaaaaaaase spare me Mr. Hollywood! Hey! Good action movie though!",The Bourne Supremacy
340,MovieBuff4245,Get Bourne Again!,7,25 July 2004,"The Bourne Supremacy is that rare sequel that more than holds its own to the original, as well as a being a standout film in an already over-saturated summer season. Matt Damon once again turns in a stellar performance as Jason Bourne, who struggles daily with the memories of his time as an ex-CIA trained assassin. After living a free life for the last 2 years, he is set up to take the fall for 2 agents' deaths in Berlin. So once again it's up to he and Marie to stay one step ahead of them. This movie features 2 well put together car chase scenes and the action is breath-taking. I especially liked the expanded role of Brian Cox's character. He was convincing and chilling in his scenes and Joan Allen is a fresh face following in the footsteps of Chris Cooper in The Bourne Identity. The fact that it was raining tonight helped set the mood for me as I got in the theater. I'm not going to get into whether I think it was better or worse than the first one. I'm just going to say if you liked The Bourne Identity at all then you owe it to yourself to check this one out. If you don't then Bourne will bring this fight to your doorstep..lol",The Bourne Supremacy

342,bongo-6,Let's not blame the director too much,2,30 July 2004,"This could have been a great film of its type: good story, good script, great music; adequate acting - but oh that camera work! Good enough for a commercial or an MTV video but in a thriller I would like to see shots last longer than one and a half seconds: some of them are even shorter. The quick editing is used in the action sequences, of course, and whilst fast editing isn't a bad thing it would be nice to give us a break from it once in a while so we could, at least, see some of the action. There are stunt people risking their lives in this movie and the audience doesn't get a chance to see them. The biggest worry would be if too many people like it and it becomes the norm!! There is a scene at the end in a Russian apartment  and I won't give anything away  which is supposed to be a tender scene which doesn't work. No need for that scene; it lacked pace and direction. It's a shame because director Paul Greengrass's previous film, Bloody Sunday, was brilliant. I can't really see the studio letting the director have his head and using so much coverage on the action scenes with multi-camera set ups, hand held cameras, steady-cams and so on and then giving it to an editor and letting him do what he likes, without knowing; so the studio was obviously in on the style of this film from the get go - so let's not blame the director too much.",The Bourne Supremacy
343,kaibab-2,Save it for DVD,4,27 October 2004,"There are great movies about innocents being caught up in spy activities. Note THE 39 STEPS and NORTH BY NORTHWEST and THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH. This is a great formula. Bourne is an innocent made innocent way by amnesia. The first version THE BOURNE IDENTITY was a classic. The SUPREMACY is ruined by the hand-held shaky camera and by the use of extremely fast editing and the use of close-ups during chase scenes. I think it a waste to stage such scenes and then ruin them by not making them watchable. I wished for a DVD slo-mo version so that I could follow what was happening.The whole movie seemed liked a trailer, it was cut so fast. The experience was very disappointing and a directors mis-applied technique.",The Bourne Supremacy
344,nivekj1,One of the best sequels in a summer of great sequels!,9,23 July 2004,"First Shrek 2, then Spider-Man 2, and now the best sequel of them all this summer, The Bourne Supremacy. The best sequels always expand on the characters and themes of their predecessors and this one's no different. It's steeped in personal choice, consequence, and morality. I know that it's based on a Cold War book, but updated suitably to today's audience. I was impressed by the first movie (The Bourne Identity) with its realism, its European sensibility, and its two leads Matt Damon and Franka Potente. I was glad someone had the guts to use Potente after her awesome turn in Run Lola Run. Both return in the second one and they give everything they got. Karl Urban makes for an incredible parallel agent to Bourne, and the returning cast as well as the newcomers are great as well. While I liked the chase from the first movie more than the big scene in this one, I liked the ending of the chase more. I won't say much because to say anything more about this movie would be criminal. Just go see it. I've never seen a film that made me want to buy the first one just so I can have it when the second one comes out on video. I think The Bourne Supremacy is the best sequel so far this summer because it doesn't try to eclipse what came before it. It only supplements it, while at the same time, becomes its own film. Both Shrek 2 and Spider-Man 2 one-up their older versions; instead of being a continuation, it's an improvement of the same. While Supremacy has its work done on a literary basis, it still needs to be adapted to fit the style of the previous movie as well as operate as something completely different.I'll say this: if there's one thing wrong with this movie, it's the shaky hand-held cinematography. Should someone want to retitle this movie, it could be called The Bourne Epilepsy. All else, it's a solid movie. The acting, the storytelling, this movie should be seen to appreciate that good movies are still being made today. Bravo!",The Bourne Supremacy
345,bradley-trent,NOT an improvement on the original!,5,21 September 2006,"Documentary-style film-making definitely has its place (such as director Greengrass's ""Sunday, Bloody Sunday,"" and ""Flight 93,"") but not in a sequel to a movie as lush and taut as Doug Liman's 2002 version of the ""Bourne Identity."" No one paying the slightest bit of attention would confuse this movie with a real documentary, so why send the viewer lurching and jerking around like a sophomore UCLA student filmmaker would? Don't get me wrong: I loved the characters, the plot and the sports. And I loudly applaud Greengrass's shunning of CGI stunts. But I implore him to use a more conventional style of cinematography for the next Bourne installment. If I want to make myself seasick, I'll go rent ""The Blair Witch Project.""",The Bourne Supremacy

Like the last time, he's willing to fight back.Kudos for the writers for not making this an overly sentimental film.  The main bad guy in the film is a relentless Russian Secret Service agent, who reminds me of the Serbian sniper from the film Behind Enemy Lines.They say the adult thriller genre faded away after being peaking in the 70s. Hopefully, more quality thrillers will be made once this film is confirmed in a few days as a bona fide smash. Also, rent the astonishing sleeper film Spartan, if you enjoy the Bourne films.Worth seeing if you liked the first one.by Triniman",The Bourne Supremacy
347,jdgratz,Could've been much more.,5,13 December 2004,"I recall watching the first of this series and being fairly impressed from a pure action movie point of view. The story was cut, the acting was decent, and the actions was intense. I guess that in this one, though, they tried to stick to the action bit alone. Whenever a sequel does this, they leave much to be desired with few exceptions. The story was basic and the portrayal was very choppy.Damon has some acting ability. Granted, nothing may ever top his breakout performance, but he's not the worst I've seen. The script attempted to make him the 'strong, silent type'. He did the best he could with it, but your main character in a film such as this needs to at least have some character. they attempt to give him some at the very end of the film, but it's too little too late.Another fatal error in a film like this is the obvious nature of the identity of the saboteur. The nature of the script, combined with the quality of mystery from those who were trying to find Bourne kinda left it in the hand of two people. One of which was so innocent in knowledge of the whole situation that she was clearly cast to be the apologetic misunderstander by the end of the movie. This came true as well.In order to gain the 5/10 I gave this movie, though, was simply the car chase towards the end of the movie. Car chases have become extremely commonplace in action films, and due to this, have become rather monotonous. But the cinematography and chosen angles gave this one a new feel. Many of the explosive crashes and wild driving action was depicted from inside the cockpit of the cab Bourne is driving. Instead of the anticipation you receive from normal car chase scenes, where you can see from a distance what may or will occur, the surprise factor is terrific. You DON'T see it coming.So, it's worth a watch if you've exasperated all possibilities of movies on your list of ""movies to see"", but until then, you may want to stay away.",The Bourne Supremacy
348,f_alcon,One of the few instances where the sequel is better - even with the action cinematography issues.,7,14 September 2004,"""Even killers have choices"". An extension of the prequel and not an adaptation of the book, it is definitely one of the better assassin films.The script was one reason for the film's improvement over the original, the direction was another (except for the action cinematography, discussed later). There are also good all-round performances, and it is a pity we have not seen Joan Allen in more ""major features"" lately. Though her acting will not garner any Oscars, it does bring a certain class we do not see too often in such films. Damon manages to depict Bourne's character successfully this time - convincing in both the assassin and human sides of the role's coin. So as Chris Cooper was the standout actor in the prequel, Allen and Damon share the plaudits this time - whilst the reliable Cox and Stiles do not let the production down in their respective roles.Damon's Bourne films are not faithful to the books, and they do not need to be: the book would almost always look better in one's head than any film could hope to portray. But the author has been dead for a few years now, so I assume there is freedom to explore this film series' potential and take on the Bond films in the spy-action genre. That is, so long as the Bourne series does NOT become yet another Bond series, for we already HAVE a Bond series.POSSIBLE SPOILERS: Where this fails over the prequel is not in the editing (which connects a film's sequences), but the choice for action cinematography. It fails to give the action sequences a proper perspective (ie. to see what's going on), because the camera was ""too close"" to properly capture (and frame) the action. This is easily seen in some of the unarmed-combat sequences, or the (Moscow) car chase which alluded to be superior over the prequel's (Paris) chase - but could hardly be judged from the camera's position relative to the action.The choice is understandable, for this type of camera work gives more immediacy/intensity to the action. But it becomes useless when one has no perspective to place such immediacy within. After all, one of the prequel's most memorable scenes was the (Paris) car chase - and it was memorable because one could ""see"" the action and the chase, rather than JUST ""feel"" it.There are times where this style does work, as in the director's previous film (BLOODY Sunday). Unfortunately, the action cinematography (and relevant handycam) approaches here fail more than gaining. Perhaps a marriage of the 2 styles would have succeeded to appease both director and audiences.If this film had test audiences, one wonders why no executive picked up on the feedback from this critical issue. As most of this film's IMDb comments also found it a problem, how could test audiences possibly miss it? Isn't this why Hollywood executives are there - in addition to disrupting artistic visions whilst chasing lucrative box office $ through formulaic fare?",The Bourne Supremacy

350,Sterling52,Great Spy Flick Gets a Solid Encore in Supremacy,8,24 September 2008,"Better direction highlights THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, an all too rare case of a sequel actually outdoing a fine original. Jason Bourne is on the run again--and, just as in the original, the pursuers are assassins, the CIA, and his own past. It seems that settling down for the quiet life just isn't in the cards for our put-upon hero; indeed, as so much of the last movie built towards him finding peace with his new girlfriend, it's more than a little jarring to watch her get wasted mere minutes after the opening credits. Oh, well. It's the LETHAL WEAPON 2 syndrome all over again--you can't have a pesky relationship get in the way of all the intrigue, betrayals, butt-whuppin', and car chasin' that has to be squeezed into a two hour action flick. It could have been different. Bourne could have quietly disappeared, you see, if it weren't for those downright inconvenient CIA bigwigs framing him for knocking off government field agents. And, of course, it's not even that simple. Things get very complicated and clever in this second installment of the Bourne trilogy, and the disciplined hand of Paul Greengrass is an upgrade in the direction of the tale.

True, the movie does not follow the book as closely as the Richard Chamberlain version, but the screen play the dirctor chose to follow is a nice departure from the book.I enjoyed the Bourne Identity (BI) quite a bit once I got over the fact that it was different than the book of the same name. That being said, the Bourne Supremacy (BS) was much better than the Bourne Identity. I gave BI an 8. BS I give a 9. It could lose some profanity and I would like it better.

And I didnt much like the book anyways.Its a very fast paced action movie with lots of ""new"" spy techniques and tactics, and  a solid performance by Matt Damon and Brian Cox.The thing I liked about this movie the most was the return of some of the elements that marked the cold war spy movies. It had a agent gone ""rogue"",CIA and criminals  hunting him down with equal ruthlesness, and after a long time, a Russian Assasin hot on his train, with trademark(of hollywood) stubble and a scowl.  It has car chases, fist fights, gadgets everything you need a spy film.A remarkable thing is the amount darkness in the lead character. He is an assasin and he acts like one. bourne character has been converted to quite a complex character instead of the wronged nice assasin of ludlum books.

The only problem with the movie is that the director decided to use the ""shaky camera"" technique (remember how ""Speed 2"" was ruined in just this manner?). This makes for a very unpleasant viewing experience and is probably done to save money on the action choreography.
The film has a chase sequence that could have ranked up in the top ten chase sequences of all time, but unlike those in ""Bullitt"", ""The Seven Ups"" and ""The Peacemaker"", this chase sequence is ruined by sloppy direction, shaky camera work and blurry transitions.I can only assume that either the producers were too cheap to film the movie correctly or the director was too incompetent to film the movie correctly.

Instead, there's an unnecessarily convoluted plot involving another conveniently placed lost memory.  And when the truth comes out, it's neither surprising nor interesting.  There's also little humanity in the characters to care about; they're all just flat, CIA-type caricatures, and without his girlfriend, Bourne is flat and uninvolving.

The Borne Supremacy played up the action sequences which led to a sacrifice in the sophistication of the script.

Mat Damon delivers an excellent performance and plays his role well. The other actors and actresses deliver good and excellent performances and also play their characters well.The only complaints about this movie are about the director Paul Greengrass(who I've never heard of until I saw this movie). Greengrass has done something drastically different than other directors-he used a hand-help camera for the majority of the scenes.Although sometimes confusing they do add a thrilling and entertaining element to the film. However the hand help camera I admit was a little over-used. This film isn't suited for people who get motion sickness frequently and this accounts for most of the negative reviews.This movie is really special because it is as good as the original (which most sequels don't even come close to the original).

Not the greatest spy movie of all time, but riveting and compelling the entire time. Matt Damon has againproven his ability to carry a movie and he makes a great action star. There is a car chase scene in this movie that is worth seeing on the big screen. My only complaint is the over-use of camera-shaking during the fist-fight scenes. What a distraction...otherwise a solid action film. 8/10",The Bourne Supremacy

However, the director has ruined this film with the ""Jiggle Cam"" effect. If the point is to make it look like it was a seasick camera operator with alcoholic withdrawal symptoms, then the effect worked. I watched this on TV and was praying for the commercials. The action scenes are a blur of incomprehensible snippets from a bad dream, pieces of jiggling camera flashes that confuse the viewer. Who is shooting who, what car is he in, why are we in an office and why is the cameraman jiggling around? Whose viewpoint is this shot from? Code Blue, in room 410, bring epinephrine STAT! This director went over the top using the effect with the result that a great film was made into a cliché hospital TV show. Jiggling the camera is cliché already. There, that ought to get the message across. Hollywood, ENOUGH WITH THE JIGGLE CAM ALREADY! IT HAS BEEN DONE TO DEATH!",The Bourne Supremacy
364,stuff2delete,"Very entertaining, but not great",8,6 August 2004,"I'm a big fan of espionage films and I think The Bourne Identity is one of the best ever, so I really expected a lot from the sequel. This caused some slight disappointment. The Bourne Supremacy is not nearly as good as the first film.The plot is pretty solid, that is, non of the characters does anything evidently stupid or illogical (a Cardinal Sin in any good spy movie, James Bond excluded). Yet it feels a bit sloppy. A few of the plot twists are just too convenient.One good thing this film managed to retain from its predecessor is the low-key action scenes. No exploding buildings, matrix style kung-fu fights or when-in-doubt-pull-trigger-style shoot-outs. It's all more restrained, functional. It's tactics rather than overwhelming force.The acting is pretty good too, especially Brian Cox and Julia Stiles in supporting roles. The shaky documentary style cinematography seems a little misplaced, but I didn't think it was irritating.Regardless of its shortcomings, this film is still a must for those who like the genre. Fot others it's just a couple of hours good quality entertainment. I'm rating it 7/10. Wait, OK, 8/10.",The Bourne Supremacy

It didn't, however, live up the first as an enjoyable movie experience.  The thing that made me want to see the sequel was the way Borne handled himself in the first movie.  In a moment's notice, he would assess a situation and deal with it.  Smooth, clean, and exciting hand to hand combat and a master of arms, cars, you name it.... It was fun to watch. 
In the Bourne Supremacy, the same cool moves were there, but you couldn't see them.  During action scenes, the camera angle was too close; scenes shifted quickly and shook violently.  I came out of the movie sick from vertigo.Story = 9 of 10     Cinematography = 4 of 10",The Bourne Supremacy

I really felt for poor Bourne, he couldn't escape surveillance. It was really scary to think that wherever one goes you could be monitored, Big Brother is watching! There was hardly any respite from wall to wall action, the technique of hand-held cameras and fast zooming in and out became irritating after a short time, it may have sustained the tenseness but was sore on the eyes. It was good thriller plot and had a dialogue that may have been a bit difficult to follow at times but better than some higher profile movies I could mention.

Nowadays, sequels to movies are getting better than the movies themselves. This is no exception.More of the same from what we saw with ""The Bourne Identity"". Less concentration on the flashy, what we've come to associate with action-esque scenes and more concentration on the drama unfolding behind the plot. The writers may have broken a bit from their status-quo when they had Bourne blow up the house, sending numerous officers flying as he walked away from the building (typical cliché action movie scene), but still a great mix of fighting scenes and car chases with perfectly placed ""less interesting"" plot-building scenes.One minor issue I had with the movie didn't arise from the plot or the story-line, but from the camera movement during action scenes. I had to actually pause this movie three or four times during these scenes just to get my head straight. Perhaps it's a style choice, but I prefer to be able to see what's going on during fight and car chase scenes.(8/10). Also a must see, especially if you saw the 1st of the Bourne Series.",The Bourne Supremacy

I went into thisthinking that it would be a special effects action flick, and was verymuch surprised (positively).But let me back up.  I have never read the books (are therebooks?).  I liked ""Identity.""  This film story tracks with the previousfilm (though you will probably have to refresh with the DVD), andcontinues the story.  Both are very gritty and ""real,""  which leads meto what I liked about both.The director completely left out any magical effects and filmed themovie as if ""you were there.""

This lead to the feeling that you were living inthe situation (in the movie sense, of course).

It seems like they sacked the camera crew or ran out of money and had to return their tripods! The filming is worse than a YouTube amateur video of a crime scene. Wtf were they thinking!!?? I could not complete watching this movie. It was that bad! I could feel a migraine coming on approx half way through as the camera suddenly started swinging all over the place and jumping from scene to scene every 0.5 seconds. My wife felt exactly the same and had to close her eyes and just listen until we decided to just switch this shxt off! Some idiot even runs with the camera while filming this! How dumb!

I knew the story would be good; it had an excellent cast, and another chance for some great stunts and special effects.  I'm sure the acting was good.  But between the poor editing, and the abominable direction, it was hard to tell.  I do not know who gave the green light to director Paul Greengrass, but as soon as the first dailies starting coming in, a gargantuan red light should have popped up.  I have not seen anything else directed by Greengrass, but I will be sure to avoid anything else he does.The type of direction applied to this film was totally immature.  There is a lot to be said for keeping the camera still, and letting your audience actually see what is happening.  After viewing this film, I could kind of tell you what was going on with the story, but as far as the action sequences go, I've got nothing.  Every action sequence was so fast and so jerky, that after a while, I stopped trying to follow what was going on.  I figure wait until the end and then see where the story goes from there.I was really, Really, REALLY excited to see this sequel, and oh so terribly disappointed.  Doug Liman did such a superior (no pun intended) job with the first film, I was pretty sure that The Bourne Supremacy would be its equal. Instead it is its jerky younger brother who doesn't know how to take direction. Save yourself the money.  Stick with The Bourne Identity, and avoid The Bourne Supremacy.",The Bourne Supremacy

But, unlike ""Identity"", this installment is not a classic.""Supremacy"" is by no means a bad film. Oh contraire. It is finely crafted, with excellent action scenes, juxtaposed with moments of tenderness. What keeps this film from attaining the magnificence of it's predecessor are a number of elements:-The middle child syndrome. This is typical of any second film in a trilogy, where it essentially ends in the same place it started. -But mostly, it's the overdone steadycam (or shakeycam) technique that the director, Paul Greengrass, seems to love so much. It's fine to convey a sense of realism and immediacy, but when the camera moves so much that the viewer can't even keep track of the action, that's a problem. I actually had to look away at several points to avoid a migraine. Sometimes, Paul, you need to whip out the good old tripod and slap the camera on there. -Lastly, this film just doesn't seem to have the same heart that ""Identity"" had. Perhaps that stems from Franke Potente's severely diminished role here.Despite these shortcomings, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is a very good action film, and it does well to link the the first (""Identity"") and last (""The Bourne Ultimatum"") films of the trilogy.",The Bourne Supremacy

I know going in that this movie has nothing in common with the book; and that's fine with me.  It really shouldn't have claimed based on; that's an insult not only to Ludlum but also the screenwriter, who pretty good job. Anyway, it's a solid spy action flick.  The story is decent; there are arguably holes here and there, scenes that feels very tagged-on (the entire moscow arc), but it's still more thoughtful than most of the movies I've seen this summer.My one complaint was the camera work.  I'm okay with the occasional shaky cam.  I'm actually not that annoyed with all the action being blurred, but isn't it a little excessive to shake when a character walks or soft focus blur during every close-up?  I ended up looking away from the screen whenever there's a 'walking scene' or a closeup to rest my eyes so I don't throw up.  It would have been so much better if I can just watch the whole movie through, without getting sick.  Other than that, I really like it. But then, I'm biased, since I'm a Karl Urban fan.

There were no sly asides in this movie, no silly one-liners or the hero doing ridiculous things.  We have a great movie, well filmed, well written with talented actors that make you believe this is real.  There was a good balance of excitment and mystery.  And when it's exciting, the movie really puts you in the middle of whatever is happening be it a fight or chase.  Usually, car chases do nothing for me, they're over done and unexciting.  The car chase in Bourne Supremacy was masterful.  I was cringing in my seat flinching at each hit.  The movie completely worked for me.  This is definitely one that requires a second viewing just to get the pieces that I missed the first time around.  I'd say a 9/10 only because I thought one fight scene (a rolled up magazine?!

Although the locations are still quite exciting, the splendid cinematography has been replaced by a grim and dull photography.The major low point of the movie though is the shooting of the actions scenes, and there are many. The use of the hand-held camera and excessive close ups is used to the point of nauseating the audience. There is no way you want to watch a fight or car chase like that again. Too bad for the cast - especially Matt Damon and Joan Allen - who give an impressive performance. The music is also good and helps keep a rhythm and interest, although the story line and character development are quite thin compared to the original.Overall quite a disappointment.

Matt Damon has certainly grown into the role as Jason Bourne and we se him with a little more angst than in the first film. As ""Supremacy"" is put mostly in Berlin and Moscow it gives the film a touch of realism, acting out the action-scenes in a gloomy, dirty and other-than-the-streets-of-LA setting.

The bliss ends suddenly after someone tries to frame Bourne for CIA deal gone wrong. ""Bourne Supremacy"" sets dynamic pace from the beginning. The storyline isn't as original and surprising as in ""Bourne Identity"", but it's a solid spy movie. No exaggeration. When I watch it I feel like I'm watching real, credible spy agency operation.The cinematography and fast cuts are a slight disappointment. In some fights and chases the scenes are too short, too jumpy. And I get it, I accept SOME shaky camera work in action sequence. But a calm conversation? Two people talking and I'm almost getting motion sickness, because the cinematographer can't keep a persons face in the frame. Other than that, the film is superb. Easily among my ""top 10 ever"". The casting team did a marvelous job. Matt Damon IS Jason Bourne. I'll always see Ward Abbott when I see Brian Cox. Joan Allen is not my favorite actress, but does very believable performance as Pamela Landy. Karl Urban became one of best cinema villains. His coldness fits the mood of the whole movie. A few years earlier I thought Karl Urban would always be Eomer from ""The Lord of the Rings"". Nope. Karl Urban is Kirill, the cold-blooded FSB hit-man. And Marton Csokas, the Munich asset also performs brilliantly.I've seen the movie a few times. Maybe five. Every time I rewatch it I'm amazed how good a film can be without over the top CGI effects. Believable weapons, realistic explosions, brilliant hand-to-hand combat (Munich fight is one of best cinema fights EVER) and the Moscow car chase, damn, those cars crashing in the Volga taxi, the cars in the tunnel and the final crash inside the tunnel - WOW. My favorite movie car chase. Ever. There are some slight deficiencies about manual gear handling or survivability of head-on crash in a Volga (rrright), but other than that the chase is excellent.The soundtrack is very pleasant. Quite similar to the first movie. The general setting and filming locations provide immersively gloomy atmosphere. Cinematography is quite good if you forget about the shaking. Gripping action sequences and general fast-pace make it a very entertaining film. Highly recommended!",The Bourne Supremacy
383,Snowman_Mcknives,A Sad Step Down,6,26 April 2007,"The first film in this series was awesome. Bourne was sympathetic, Franka Potente was wonderful and the baddies were really easy to hate. Full marks for all that, so what went wrong? the film starts out with a flashback, Bourne remembering a job he did in Berlin while he was with the clandestine hit squad, Treadstone. Bourne has gone off the grid, living in various third world countries with his girlfriend. the plot kicks off when a high level CIA purchase in Berlin is swindled, both the client and buyer killed, and Bourne's fingerprints are all over it. before long, Bourne comes under fire in Goa, India from the same man who did the killing in Berlin. following the loss of his girlfriend in the attack, Bourne swears vengeance, and heads off to Europe.One off the best things about Identity was its ability to make the audience care about Bourne, he's a nice guy, he's human. In this one, he might as well be the terminator. We see Bourne as his enemies must have seen him before his amnesia: cold, heartless, pitiless. He behaves more like a villain, keeping us at an emotional distance.If you've ever read a Tom Clancy novel, you'll work out the plot about 4 minutes after meeting the bad guys. and with Bourne acting like a kill-bot for the whole movie, the film has neither a complex plot nor an emotional core. We stop sympathizing with his rampage of revenge after he stops letting us.The climax, a wild, slick car chase through Moscow is objectively great. but by this point in the story, with the main nasty bloke sorted out, we don't even know what Bourne's doing in Russia. and so this extended action set piece is wasted on an audience who haven't been told what's going on. the quiet character scene that follows where Bourne reveals the truth about the death of a young girl's parents to her should have preceded the car chase.none the less, the whole movie is slick, but it lacks the emotional centre and clear objective of the first. while clear objectives don't always work (they can be detrimental in a lot of films) this is a thriller, and if we don't know where the hero is going, and he's a jerk, we don't care",The Bourne Supremacy
384,alex_imdb,One step down: back to Hollywood standards.,6,13 November 2004,"I've just watched it, and have some mixed feelings about it. First of all, the creators continued the good tradition started in the first flick, which is adapting a book by simply trashing its guts and leaving the cover: those who've read ""The Bourne Supremacy"" will find (once again) that the movie has nothing in common with the original book, aside of a rather arbitrary coincidence of names (not places).Secondly, I am not ready yet for this bright new and fancy editing style which looks as if the editor's pit bull had found the film the day before it was edited. The action scenes are (IMHO) impossible to watch. At least I couldn't make out what was happening from that short glimpses of blurry images filmed by a seemingly epileptic camera man, where the overwhelming sound of kicks and blows is the only reference to the scene's story line. Very big disadvantage next to the first movie, where the camera was also shaky, ""documentary-like"", but the key fight sequence was clear and therefore very impressive; Kali is an impressive martial art, but in order to understand how impressive it is you have to see the ""chain sequences"" and appreciate the beauty and efficiency of the movements. That was done pretty good in the ""The Hunted"" and the latest ""The Bourne Identity"". I was expecting a better fights from the second part, I got none.I also found some lack of intelligent script writing, as compared to the first part: a low blow to the film's credibility. Bourne's creativity suffered a heavy loss, the tricks look trivial, and the car chase is just what it could be in any standard Hollywood flick: a lineal runaway with lots of (very loudly) crashed metal, not much of a brain work. Or maybe it's just because I, once again, couldn't figure it out in the middle of this dog-beaten cut-n-paste editing. Anyway, I could find no logic in the chase scene's final, and it was yet another blow to the movie's credibility.As a Muscovite, though, I was really pleased to see my city once again in a Hollywood production :) And I even was lucky enough to catch a glimpse of my home! It definitely affects my objectiveness. Some Hollywood actors actually spoke a passable Russian (Karel Roden is really good, and when Matt Damon speaks in short phrases, it sounds really good), but Karl Urban sucks. Maybe because he says most of the long phrases...I've been waiting for this movie for quite a long, I was going to enjoy it and I actually have. In spite of the fact that at times the lack of action on the screen was in a clear contradiction with the all tense and thundering music score, and in spite of the Bourne's downgrade from a 50-million-worth precise weapon to a linear-thinking stuntmaster.So, to watch or not to watch? It's a good movie, but the only 2 reasons to watch it in a theater are (IMHO) - either you just can't wait for the DVD release (like it was in my case) or you want to hear the really good sound effects _that_ loud.I give it 6 out of 10, and remember that my judgment is affected by the sights of my homeland.",The Bourne Supremacy

The fact that it was also blury at times did not help.

There are a couple of really emotional scenes, showing loss, anger, and redemption and they rival anything from the first movie. Then there are suspiciously long stretches devoid of emotion. The action too gets a tad lower mark. The beginnings of mad cameraman are already evident, fast cuts, crazy angles, dark and noisy action... the style, which was further 'perfected' in the third film. JB has no clear-cut friends here, acting alone, and more methodically than ever. The tale here is a bit grimmer, too. The score now has a central theme.

Will be a great addition I will be watching over and over again.Hopefully they will come up with an equally good or even better sequel to THE BOURNE SUPREMACY.By the way, this is the first time I really ever enjoyed the performance of Joan Allen in a film. She was great.",The Bourne Supremacy

I wasn't planning to write a comment for it but all these other whiners made me afraid people were going to get the wrong idea.This is one of the most well-paced action movies I have ever seen, and the best part is that it all made sense at the end.  Usually with this type of suspense/spy movie I'm all ""...WAIT A MINUTE!.."" when I'm walking out, but with this one, although there were a lot of surprises, all the pieces seemed to fit cleverly together.Acting by all the principals was excellent, especially the CIA (or whatever clandestine agency it was) operatives. It's interesting to see Matt Damon carry a movie without a specific love interest.All in all, a very satisfying two hours.",The Bourne Supremacy
393,criticalview,Big production with no place to go,3,22 August 2004,"I saw Bourne Identity and was impressed with its originality and well thought out story line that kept us interested in more than just its action scenes. Unlike the original, the sequel has no mystery to it and originality was lacking, covered up with too many chase scenes done by a what felt like a nervous cameraman. The film missed on many fronts. There was no character building in this movie, just bursts of too many borrowed and typical action scenes and several characters with very little to do.The plot was weak, riding on the momentum and success of the original film. It's about a corrupt CIA officer working with the Russian mob to control the Russian oil business. So, in order for the bad guys to get away with their scheme, they implicated Bourne (retired in India) for the robbery and killing of CIA agents and now they wanted to kill him to cover up their plot. How original! It's a major detour from the original story about a highly trained killer who, while in search of his own identity, encountered many interesting and character building events/exchanges. The sequel was filled with long, unnecessary, overdone and boring chase scenes with highly predictable twists and turns. It was like watching the Terminator, Robocop and James Bond put together in a marketing ploy to attract/con as many viewers as possible and charge them up with cheap thrills. The movie is nothing more than a long game of cat and mouse with very predictable results. Jason Bourne's character was filled with contradictions with no real mystery to it or interesting developments. He kept getting himself into tricky situations and, as expected, kept outmaneuvering everyone else in every country. The character never really evolved and never captured our interest. It just impressed us with its over done and old action skills. I never felt close to it, just expected it to perform. It was like watching a skilled athlete performing in a game, impressing us only with his athletic skills.The chase scenes were too many, too long and too unnecessary. The photography was shaky with too many close-ups, bumps and deadly collisions, perfect for headache buildup. It's like someone was trying to distract us from realizing that this movie's plot was weak. They figured if we walked out it with a good headache, we may not be able think about it artistically.The acting was weak and undisciplined with over-dramatization of the dialogs and exchanges. Some characters (like the therapist) were weak and didn't fit well in the plot. I've always liked Mat Damon's acting, but he should've passed on this one. Although he did a good job portraying Bourne's character, Bourne's character did a poor job living up to his skills. The ending was typical of a feel good movie where all is well that ends well. The bad guys die in a disgusting way and the good guys/gals prevail and go on to manipulate our emotions with a mooshy ending, setting up the stage for another sequel.",The Bourne Supremacy

When he is framed for a CIA operation gone amiss, he is forced to resume his former life as a highly-trained assassin to survive.But make sure you have seen The Bourne Identity before watching this for full enjoyment and to save a lot of confusion during this film.I think this scores a 9.9/10 or 5 stars!",The Bourne Supremacy

396,ShadowDragyn,A solid sequel that adds depth to the title character,7,2 August 2004,"The Bourne Identity showed a man on the run from an enemy he couldn't identify. It showed what that man was capable of when pressed, and the lengths he would go to for survival. It was interesting stuff, and Matt Damon played it beautifully. You got the sense that a very dangerous man was hidden behind that stony mask, though you only caught glimpses of it when things went sour.This time out, we get to see what Bourne is capable of when he's just plain p****d off. Here is a character much more parallel to the one presented in the novels, a much more ruthless and imposing figure who will stop at nothing to accomplish an objective. This is Bourne as he should be: a very dangerous man indeed.That's not to say that the sequel is better than the original. In fact, in most ways it's a tie. Excellent fight choreography (though we don't get to see much of it in this film), incredible car chases, and bits of edge-of-the-seat suspense are showcased in both. Personally, I give The Bourne Identity a slight edge thanks to the freshness of the storyline and the more coherent action sequences.An 8 out of 10 movie that I give a 7 because of the much overused ""frantic"" fight scenes.Note to Hollywood: stop filming hand-to-hand fights by hanging a camcorder between the two combatants to make us feel like we are actually there. It's a movie. Let us watch it.",The Bourne Supremacy
397,sakimoto51,Incredible!!! 10/10,10,24 July 2004,"I absolutely loved this film!  The Bourne Supremacy is simply incredible! Every bit as good as The Bourne Identity.  As someone mentioned, the ""shoddy"" camera work is noticeable at times...but in no way does this detract from the story or the connection you begin to feel to Bourne.  In fact, I can really only remember one moment when I thought the camera work was ""bad"".  Someone else called it a ""vengeance"" flick, but I think this is a terrible interpretation of the events that transpired.  In fact, throughout the movie you get the feeling that Bourne cares much more about Treadstone than he does about Marie.  This is easily one of the best action/spy flicks I have ever seen.  I pray that they will make The Bourne Ultimatum.",The Bourne Supremacy
398,erik-imdb,"Solid story, solid actors, HORRIBLE DIRECTING",4,6 September 2004,"It seems to be that these days the most difficult thing in Hollywood is to produce a movie based on a decent script. This movie had the script, it had the actors, it had the franchise to sell it. Doug Liman (who directed The Bourne Identity) turned down the opportunity to helm this picture (and somehow earned an Executive Producer credit instead) and it wound up in the hands of Paul Greengrass. Let me be frank: Mr. Greengrass created possibly the most poorly-directed action movie I've seen in my life (and I see a lot of movies).Mr. Greengrass is incapable of showing us action. What he does instead is instruct the DP shake the camera horribly whenever there is any high-speed movement being captured. This technique has been used extensively in a minimalist way by other filmmakers to convey the force of an impact; I've never been a big fan of it, but it isn't overly distracting either. Usually. In this case, think ""The Bourne Supremacy, photographed by the crew that brought us The Blair Witch Project.""I'm not kidding about this. Bourne runs, the image jumps all over the place - not the usually hand-held camera that is sometimes used to convey the sensation of running, but a hand-held camera held by a crack addict with a severe inner-ear problem. Bourne swings his fist, and the camera swings wildly everywhere. Bourne actually hits something, and you might as well close your eyes or find someplace convenient to vomit (my girlfriend actually was getting motion sickness after awhile).About 30 or 40 minutes into the film, we were completely sick (figuratively and literally) of this. Basically what is happening is that Mr. Greengrass couldn't cleanly capture an action scene (fistfight, car chase, foot chase, etc) if his life depended on it. The thought process must have been along the lines of ""I can't choreograph a fight, so... look like you're fighting, I'll tackle the cameraman, and hopefully the audience will see something other than the ceiling.""Too bad; this movie had everything else going for it. The plot was decent (we figured it out a bit before we were supposed to, but it was still enjoyable), the dialogue credible, and the acting above-average. In the hands of a competent director, this movie could have been a 7 or an 8, but in the shaky hands of Mr. Greengrass and crew, I give it a very annoying 4/10.",The Bourne Supremacy
399,esandfor,I didn't expect much...,6,24 August 2004,"and I wasn't dissapointed.All in all, it wasn't a truly bad move, but it wasn't that good either.  My biggest complaint is that the director seemed to go out of his way to make the movie seem fast paced, and at times got carried away with this notion.During one car chase scene, it seemed to me like each visual clip lasted less than two seconds on the screen before the next image replaced it.  This went on for way too long.  If only they had put that much effort into developing the story and characters.On the positive side, my $6 box of pop corn was fresh and yummy.",The Bourne Supremacy
400,melikeemovies,The Eye-Strain Supremacy,1,26 July 2004,"THE BOURNE IDENTITY really took me by surprise in the summer of 2002. I thought it was an engaging and entertaining, if not hollow, action-spy thriller filled with great stunts and an even better cast. You can imagine how much I was anticipating the release THE BOURNE SUPREMACY in the summer of 2004. Well, imagine my surprise when I walked out of the theater last night thinking the movie was inferior in every way possible.There's no plot: Bourne is framed for killing some people. WOW! That must have taken weeks to come up with. The screenplay is devoid of much wit or engaging dialogue. The movie looks like they strapped a camera on the backs of a couple of monkeys and chased the monkeys around Europe with big sticks.The camera never stopped moving. It was a lot of shaky, hand-held, out-of- focus-half-the-time closeups with terrible blocking, and the fight scenes and car chases were completely incoherent. Talk about making my eyes hurt. I literally had to close my eyes about half-way through the film just so I didn't go blind from the eye-strain. And Ebert & Roeper toted this film as one of the best action films in years? Puh-lease.Let's hope that when the next BOURNE movie gets greenlit that the filmmakers learn how to use a steadicam and a dolly!!!*1/2 out of ****",The Bourne Supremacy
401,Decrypt3,Near flawless,8,29 July 2004,"Action movies are supposed to make your heart race and your adrenaline glands roar into action. ""The Bourne Supremacy"" does exactly that, with its centerpiece being an insane car chase, certainly the best one I've ever seen.I say it's near flawless only because the camera work was nausea-inducing. Of course for scenes of intense action it is customary to have a shaky, hand-held camera, but not for every scene in the movie, for God's sake. It wasn't so much nausea-inducing as headache-inducing, as my eyes got tired of flicking around to follow the action.Otherwise, apart from a few believability problems, I couldn't find anything wrong. My problems include: how can you get shot in the shoulder and not have a hole in your coat? How can you get broadsided in a car by another one at high speed and not even get sidelined with whiplash? How can a cruddy old taxi outpace brand-new, souped-up Mercedes-Benzes? But that's all OK - I should know by now, the hero of an action movie is invincible.""The Bourne Supremacy"" keeps the adrenaline flowing and the knuckles white almost constantly. The cast is flawless - nobody dragged the rest down. If you want your movie to be successful, you need a really good lead actor, and that's exactly what Matt Damon is. He balances the troubled human and the trained superhuman with amazing ease and naturalness. He is equally at home being frightened and confused as being ruthless and efficient.""The Bourne Supremacy"", as a spy action-thriller, is a refreshing change from the Bond franchise. The main difference here is that the hero is not a suave, handsome, martini- drinking, womanizing, suit-wearing, British assassin, but a CIA deserter who has changed his ways and only wants to settle down for a quiet life with the woman he loves, and who is haunted by the nightmares and visions induced by his past. In short, he's human, and that makes us pay more attention to him and care about him. Of course neither Bond nor Bourne makes mistakes, and they both like to drive and run really fast, but hey - sometimes breaking too far from the mold is bad.My rating is 8/10. I really hate coming out of a great movie with a headache just because some camera-person has a shaky hand.",The Bourne Supremacy
402,jmbezeau,"Great movie, if only someone could steady the camera",6,30 July 2004,"What is this?  Instead of showing us the action, they left it off and shook frenetically the camera instead. Is this a new way to save money or just be certain people wouldn't want to see the movie again? I am quite a bit disappointed that I was that much distracted.It was so awful I had to look elsewhere from time to time. It was distracting from the otherwise quite good action movie.
The actors were remarkable, so I assume the direction was good.  The plot was deployed in such a way I enjoyed discovering it, as I didn't read Ludlum's book. I even look forward seeing another Bourne movie hoping they will find another way to do action scenes.",The Bourne Supremacy
403,dwalmsley9-2,The first fild that actually made me sick..,1,27 August 2004,I watched the Bourne Identity on DVD the night before going to the cinema to see this. I looked forward to it but...Twenty minutes after the start I had to leave the cinema. I felt very ill and it wasn't the curry we ate earlier. I am sometimes a bit sensitive to hand-held camera shots but this was aweful. EVERY frame was jumpy - and it wasn't the guy in the projection room dancing.My teenage son went with his mates to another cinema the same evening and had similar problems - though he stuck it out to the end with his eyes closed several times.By the way: my son and I watched Matrix Revolutions from the fourth row ona big screen.

404,vhmascitti,Bourne to be wild....,8,12 August 2004,"I'm going to go see this movie again. This time, I'm going to actually count the number of cars that get wrecked in the process because the first time through, I really did lose count after the first 20 minutes. That's probably because, as thrillers go, this one is really pretty thrilling. And Matt Damon might just be the most darling boy to stare into a camera since Cary Grant. His little boy looks, his determined charm and the way he can wallop all adversaries is so much fun to watch that it's actually possible to forget that the plot of every ""Bourne"" movie tends to get lost in the action -- and in car body count. Leaving a trail of dead bodies, dead engines and broken windows behind, this Bourne-again movie is mesmerizing in its fast-forward style action. Barely has Jason eluded one enemy than another slinks in. The human body count rises as he races through every grim European city imaginable (except Helsinki I think) without the sun breaking through a single cloud and without a decent night's sleep. (In fact, in the course of the film, I became obsessed with the idea that this guy hadn't gotten a more than a catnap in 6 countries.) By willingly suspending disbelief for almost two hours, it's possible to thoroughly indulge in this often exhilarating, often exhausting film. At its conclusion, the ""Bourne Supremacy"" gives movie fans what they're all too often cheated of: Satisfaction. And a good, albeit, rocky ride.",The Bourne Supremacy
405,spoonerstreet,First Movie to ever give me motion sickness,3,13 December 2004,"I can appreciate the new and improved way the director is trying to film this movie, but I have to say that it truly made me feel a bit sick. The movie was very flat. Jason Bourne is a great character, but they spend way too much time trying to prove that the CIA is messed up instead of focusing on how much of a twisted badass Bourne is.Matt Damon did a great job playing the character, but the hand-held camera crap needed to be toned down quite a bit. At one point in the movie, I started timing the camera cuts, and none were longer than 5 seconds. I shouldn't be exhausted after a movie...exhilarated, maybe, but not physically tired, and that is all The Bourne Supremacy succeeded in doing.",The Bourne Supremacy
406,sandpuppy,The Bourne Epilepsy,7,2 August 2004,"This followup to the excellent 2002 flick starts off with Jason Bourne and girlfriend Marie hanging out in a small beach house in India. Jason is still trying to piece together his past as vague memories of a botched assassination come trickling back into his head while he and Marie apparently live off the fortune they made selling the moped rental shop from the last movie. However, he soon finds out that living in hiding has some drawbacks. Namely, that anyone with access to your fingerprints can use you as an ace-in-the-hole when they want to do something naughty. And that's exactly what happens when a break-in goes awry, thus needing a fall-guy to blame it on. On top of that, a Russian oil baron is after Bourne and sends a hit-man after him in India. So much for the laying low theory.This picture replicates the gritty feeling of the first movie and has a nice old-school feel to it. It's still a globe-trotting espionage flick - Like Bond, but without all the hoary trappings (the Bond girl, the martinis, the gadget shop) that have helped make that series a complete joke.Director Paul Greengrass has done some nice things with this installment. One is not over-relying on the action scenes to carry the movie. Indeed, if there had been any more of those, my skull would have exploded. More on that later. He gives the characters some depth, and despite a bit of convolution, lays out a credible story. He's also not afraid to pull punches. There's a moment early on in the film that will come as quite a shock, especially if you are already familiar with the first movie. Definitely not the sort of safe, cookie-cutter film-making Hollywood has engaged in recently. Nor does he fall into the sentimental tar pit that undermines most pictures of this caliber. There's a scene near the end that lands a nice solid emotional punch as it wraps up the remaining loose ends that never once veers into maudlin-ville. Nice job. He also manages to get some actual acting out of Matt Damon. Not an easy thing to do. As Jason uncovers the mystery surrounding his sudden predicament, he uncovers more about his troubled past, and we begin to learn some more about him. Such as the fact that he prefers to apply mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to unconscious people underwater. That seems like it would be pretty difficult. I must have missed that part in my CPR classes. He also seems to be in no short supply of firearms no matter where he goes. Over the course of the movie, he must hit about 5 continents, and somehow remains able to brandish the hardware at any time. I guess the rest of the world isn't as hung up about that 9/11 thing as we are. He's also a computer whiz and has figured out that movie-world secret of how to make them emit those cool electronic chirping noises whenever he hits the enter key or a digital images appears on screen. Man, I wish I could figure out how that's done. Would definitely add some zing to my review-writing.Now for the bad part. The dizzying camera-work. If you go see this, do yourself a favor and bring a paint shaker from your local hardware store. Clamp your head into it, turn it on during the action scenes, and if you sync it right, you should be able to follow everything just peachy. If you don't, prepare to leave the theatre with your eyeballs in a serious state of nystagmus. It's so bad, it almost feels like a parody of all the shaky-cam action movies that have come before it. Like something SNL would do if they ever got back to being funny.Too bad, as some of the action scenes are pretty good, including a car chase inside a tunnel crowded with traffic. Unlike most action films, the surrounding cars respond like real drivers would in that instance - by doing something stupid and pulling their car out into the path of the oncoming speedsters. This results in lots of cars getting decked and bounced off the walls. It's all good, crunchy fun. Unfortunately, you'll only see bits and pieces of it. Call me old-fashioned, but I'm of the mind that complicated action scenes should be long steady pull-back shots where you can see all the hard work that went into making them. Imagine the long uncut tracking shots of Hard Boiled's hospital shootout, or the Tartar raid in Andrei Rublev being cut every half-second and filmed as if the camera were inserted into a trash can and rolled like a stuffed freshman into the middle of the action. Anyway, The Bourne Supremacy is still a good film, a better one I think in the story, action, and character departments than the original. I have to deck it a few points for the distinct lack of a tripod, but I'll be looking forward to the next one with high hopes they fix that problem.",The Bourne Supremacy
407,reviewbot,The second film in the series and Bourne is still up to his eyeballs in espionage.,7,12 August 2010,"REVIEWBOT - The Bourne Supremacy had a lot to live up to after the action packed first instalment in the series, but I can confirm that it does;nd without the usual ""upping the ante."" Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is happily living off the grid with his girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente) until an assassination attempt on him fails and Marie is killed. He soon discovers he is being framed for killing two CIA agents, and goes looking for answers. The detective investigating the murders Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) wants to bring Bourne in, with the help of Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) who worked with him on the mysterious Treadstone operation. Bourne is having flashbacks, and is once again forced to play assassin as he uncovers the truth about his past.I enjoyed the movie, and found my hard-drive could barely process it fast enough with all of the action going on! Even with the arrival of new director Paul Greengrass, the transition from The Bourne Identity was smooth, with the same tone and fast pace and gritty camera work. However, some shots were a little haphazard; especially during the car chase scenes – I found it difficult to see everything that was happening.It seems odd to me that Marie was deleted so early, after her struggle for survival in the first film. She gave the chance for viewers to see a softer, more human side to Bourne. The cynical bot in me thinks it was a plot device, as she ""slowed him down."" Aside from this the film was good, with yet another strong performance from Matt Damon, he is a mighty human.",The Bourne Supremacy
408,ak1000,Magnificent,10,31 January 2005,"I've re-watched this film on DVD after seeing at the cinema a few months ago, and I think it's even better after repeated viewing. The plot is fairly straightforward and coherent, and refreshingly free of the grandiose pretensions of the recent Bond films and the like, it's just one guy trying to figure out why his old bosses are after him (turns out the explanation is quite simple). Granted that the one guy has Jason Bourne's training, intelligence and resourcefulness, everything in the film is believable within the parameters it sets up.The acting is way better than the usual action/ spy fare, especially from Matt Damon himself, who is compelling throughout, even with limited dialogue. The pacing is perfect, and the action scenes bone-crunchingly vivid; the hand-held camera-work contributes to the sense of being in the middle of these scenes. The ""jerkiness"" and fast edits have come in for plenty of criticism, but the camera-work just requires a little more concentration from the viewer than most films,where all the action takes place within a steady frame for the viewer, making you feel like an observer rather than a participant. Once you get used to it, the fight scenes and car chases are not confusing at all- you can in fact make out exactly what's going on, and the final car chase in particular is more thrilling than anything I've seen in a while. The score by John Powell also adds a great deal to the film. It's just the best film in this genre for years, and it has a beautifully poised ending to take us into the next instalment.",The Bourne Supremacy
409,david-1230,Goodo,8,26 June 2006,"The Bourne Identity took the viewer on an often violent, highly entertaining and delightfully intriguing romp through Europe. The Bourne Supremacy employs much the same tactics but with a larger scope, both geographically and narratorially. We pick up Bourne's trail in GoaIndia, track him through Europe and then finally follow our hit-man into Russia and the post-Soviet mess of Moscow for the tradition final show down between good and evil. This binary conflagration, of course, occurs inside Bourne's rather mangled mind as well as in the East West paradigm that still lingers in these types of movies. Perhaps, in an allegorical sense, that's what makes the film interesting. Bourne's uncertainty about his identity (an amnesiac former hit-man for the CIA trying to come to terms with who he was and who he is). Going on a killing rampage on the way to making an apology to an innocent victim of his rampant violence seems, in the end, a pretty good option as it is what he is constructed to be - simply it's what he is good at, what he's trained for - just as the confused American Government (here's the allegory) feels it necessary to attack whatever moves in the post-Cold War environment (Islam being the new Red of course). However, the lesson here is that one can put the gun back in the trench coat pocket and walk towards the light (standing amongst the detritus of the final conflict, JB looks back where he has come from, a mess of piled up cars and smoke and chooses to exit the tunnel where it is brimming with light). Hmmm, maybe asking a bit much of the film here. But the flick seems desperately to want to make a comment about East West intrigue in an age where the very notion of such a conflict is essentially dead. Hence, it posits - What do you do when your enemies become your friends?The complex patchwork of visuals and plot somehow seems to allow for the film to explore this type question without it becoming bogged down in its own special effects bonanza. Its a fun little film that manages, and this is remarkable for a sequel, to continue and improve on the original idea without killing itself. However, if indeed it really is asking this kind of question, why doesn't our protagonist shoot himself in the knowledge that he cannot change?",The Bourne Supremacy

Good story, acting, and a lot was accomplished in 1hr, 48 minutes(run time). It always kept my attention. The only problem I had was the choppy, jerky camera work during the action sequences. The example I will use is the fight in the home of the other agent Bourne worked with. The fight was intense, and well done, but it was extremely hard to see exactly what happened during it. I know that the point to make the camera work chaotic during a fight is took make it look realistic(like the viewer is actually in the fight), but the whole point of WATCHING a movie is for the audience to easily SEE what the director created. Watching the movie shouldn't require work. The sequence in ""Bourne Identity"" in Bourne's apartment with the blonde-haired assassin was one of the best fight sequences I have ever seen. Every motion was fluid and well displayed for the audience, while keeping the fight intense. In my opinion, it's OK to sacrifice some realism for the sake of the audience being able to see the fight more easily. Other than that, the movie was great. Without the jerky camera movement, this movie would be a 10 out of 10. Go see it if you haven't!",The Bourne Supremacy

Just a few minutes ago I finished to watch The Bourne Supremacy and wasn't too happy about it. The movie was too fast paced for me. I agree with a previous comment that a great director doesn't need to shake the camera to create scenes of chaos, as they can be done with stationary cameras without leaving the audience dizzy.

Although the plot may be somewhat confusing for some, this action flick proves to be highly entertaining as well as a fast paced ride. The car chase scene was one of the best I have ever seen, next to The Transporter. Brian Cox's character was also brought out more in the story, and he is a fabulous actor who puts a lot of intensity into the film. Although as Jason Bourne has these ""visions"" of his past life with the CIA, it is never fully clarified in the film, and it leaves you guessing about what is going on in his head. Bourne really does not have a lot of feeling as for the death of others, but he is a trained killer, so you can't expect a lot of reaction out of Bourne's character. Overall the movie is a hit and an excellent sequel based on the incredible novels. ***1/2 out of *****",The Bourne Supremacy

The only thing I can figure out is that the film was shot and then the producer, editor, director, studio head, gaffer, gopher, janitor, or guy who read the focus group comments realized: ""We got no plot twists, no character development, and no interesting visuals. How we gonna save this franchise?"" The answer: ""Do not hold ANY shot for more than 2 seconds.If we incessantly cut, cut, cut; pan, pan ,pan; zoom, zoom, zoom; then the audience will be too confused, seasick, and migraine filled to notice that we got one big nothing.

And I would venture to say this is better than any Bond film, or any other of the genre. Grabs you from start to finish in a way no Bond film has even tried to, and the action is better. And when you compare the ability of any Bond compared to Bourne- my money would be on Jason. Especially if one takes the gun out of the fight. And, oh, the music...If the Acadamy would ever do what it should and give an Oscar to the best Action/Adventure film of the year- this Bourne would have won it, easily. One of the best Actions ever.",The Bourne Supremacy
416,rjc739,"Very complicated, totally unpredictable",8,4 January 2005,"Story line and cinematography both very complicated. A lot of thought was put into the story and the cinematography. I've never had trouble following a movie with my eyes but this one challenged me to the limit. The camera moves so fast during the chasing/fighting scenes that the images are blurred, the cameras shake frequently (cameras mounted in the cars as they hit bumps or other cars or take turns at high speeds), the cameras aren't centered, the images are too close. Sometimes the film pans in 3-4 different directions/angles within 1-2 seconds. That's how rapid the camera is. The first thirty minutes of the movie I didn't know what was happening because there was so much information being thrown out and I was ready to not go any further. I couldn't piece together who was who. The CIA agents were talking so fast and soft that I couldn't understand them. Bourne has the CIA hunting him, Germans hunting him, and Russians hunting him. You have a Russian agent in Tangiers who tries to kill him, CIA agents killing each other and Bourne tracks an unknown agent in Germany and kills him. I didn't believe one fight scene where Damon loses his gun and picks up a rolled-up magazine and starts beating this agent to a pulp with it. Hollywood. And when Damon breaks into an apartment or hotel room he knows exactly where everything is: the circuit breaker, the gas line, computer hard drives, etc. (I suppose that's done to save time). Then things started making a little more sense. The film uses flashbacks to help piece together some of the unknowns. The car chase scenes are really fantastic in this movie (if only the editing was more discernible). There is a long tunnel chase/crash scene which is the best I've ever seen. (You literally have to grab something during this scene because the drivers are so close to killing themselves). The stunt drivers in this movie really earned their pay. There are a couple real clever twists that happen in this movie. The music is very well done, it accentuates the scenes very well: not over-powering but not boring, either. Matt Damon did a great job although his involvement was not as active as the first Bourne movie: much of the movie centered around the CIA. Damon can play tough guys without coming off too strong like a Stallone or a Sean Penn which is refreshing. The ending was really good. I suppose that's it for the Bourne series, he has been vindicated. If you are elderly and have trouble focusing your eyes you will not be able to follow this movie. Bourne #1 was a better movie because it was easier to follow but Bourne Supremacy is unlike so many other Hollywood movies that it's a must see.",The Bourne Supremacy

This without a doubt is one of the best movies of all time and one of the best things of all time. Everything about this movie is amazing. If you've already seen The Bourne Identity but for some reason have yet to see this, then WHAT are you waiting for? I've seen this movie so many times and have listened to its soundtrack so many times...speaking of the soundtrack...it is probably my favorite movie soundtrack of all time. This movie is just downright a masterpiece in my completely honest opinion and as I've already stated before but will state again...one of the best THINGS to ever exist in the universe and history of the universe. WATCH THIS MOVIE!!",The Bourne Supremacy
418,adamcarter-63372,One of My Favorite Action Movies Ever,10,28 February 2020,"With the release of ""Treadstone,"" a Jason Bourne spin off TV show, right around the corner I thought it would be a great time to talk about one of my favorite movies of all time: ""The Bourne Supremacy."" I believe ""The Bourne Supremacy,"" and the Bourne Trilogy in general, rank up there as some of the best action thrillers ever produced. Why? Not only did these films revitalize the action genre, but they are some of the most intelligent action movies to exist.Director Paul Greengrass popularized a new way of shooting action scenes in this movie. Shaky cam. Some people have criticized this style. Myself included. This technique has ruined so many action movies. Filmmakers have copied this style to sickening results. In ""Taken 3"" there was literally 15 cuts in a six second period for Liam Neeson climbing a fence. It's pretty bad. But here it isn't just a series of mindless cuts or shaky footage to hide bad stunt work. There's thought behind everything.Our main character, played by Matt Damon, is an amnesiac former assassin on the run from his own government. He's constantly making choices. He's constantly paranoid that someone might be out to kill him. The shaky camera work puts us right in his shoes. It feels like we're right there with him.
But that's not the only reason I love this movie. Action movies are stupid. Now there's nothing wrong with a good old stupid action movie. I love movies like ""Con Air"" ""The Transporter"" and ""Crank."" It's just that so many action movies try to be serious and flat out fail. ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is one of the most intelligent action movies out there.Take one of my favorite scenes. A foot chase where Jason Bourne is evading the police. Bourne needs to take a train to escape the city. In most movies the train would take off as soon as the main character jumps on board. But guess what? The train doesn't leave for another five minutes! The police are closing in! So what does he do! He tricks the police into thinking he's on a barge so he can stall for time. That's pretty smart! By adding that into the action sequence it adds a new level of intensity to the scene.I'm so tired of the mindless shooting and fighting sequences in movies these days.
Paul Greengrass himself stated in the DVD commentary that ""a chase only works if it's telling a story, if it's got beats within it that unfold."" I completely agree. Action sequences like dialogue sequences need good writing. Otherwise I'm just watching things moving around quickly on a screen. And that's boring.This movie in intelligent, but it also has something a lot of action films these days does not. A heart.Jason Bourne is not a good person. He's killed a lot of people. Yet in these movies he always tries to do the right thing. He's not a killing machine. He's not John Wick. He doesn't endlessly kill rooms full of people emotionlessly walk away. The killing isn't glorified. It's brutal. Ugly. Whenever he does kill someone, the movie always takes a moment to watch Bourne gasp for his breath. It has an impact. Now there are some movies that do this, but there are few that do what I'm about to say next.
In this movie Bourne learns that on his first assignment he killed a young girl's parents and made it look like a suicide. This girl grew up believing her parents killed themselves and left her an orphan. After Bourne remembers what he did, he sets out to tell this woman the truth about her parents. He literally sits her down and looks right in her eyes and says to her, ""I killed them.""Now that is something that could not be easy to do. Name another action movie hero who takes responsibility like that. James Bond? John Wick? Ethan Hunt? John Mcclane? Nope.Not to mention right before this scene there was a brutal car chase. Bourne literally gets shot through the shoulder and almost killed. Why did he go through all that? It wasn't to save the world. It wasn't simply to escape. He went through all that simply to tell a young woman the truth. This alone puts Jason Bourne in a league of his own.The Bourne Supremacy stands out to me as one of the greatest action thrillers ever made. Honestly the last two installments ""The Bourne Legacy"" and ""Jason Bourne"" have not been up to par. I'm still waiting for something to top it. Maybe the new TV show will? I'll just have just have to see.",The Bourne Supremacy
419,dark_orion,I'm watching it right now.,7,9 December 2006,"It wasn't till Supremacy that I understood the fact that the agents are sleepers. The first half hour is spent setting up the plot and getting the viewer introduced to some new faces. There's a nice car chase in the first few minuets of the film that wasn't so shabby, but it ends on a sour note. Jason's first fight is pretty cool, but the camera work seems choppy. I found it kind of hard to fallow as it flashed 2 or 3 cuts in one hand movement. The camera bounced around like they had a real person holding it, but all that did was make it harder to view. The movie is fast paced yet easy to keep up with. The camera work is almost manic and so and jumps really fast, so far that's about the only bad part I can see to the movie. I've come across the thought that human nature a.k.a. instinct is chaos, the one thing that can't be predicted ever is what another person may or may not do. The secondary/final chase scene is much better then the first and lasts a really long time, it's so good in fact that it competes with the end chase in Gone in 60 Seconds or The Italian Job. The end leaves a lot to the imagination and could have been done better. It's a well made sequel and very fast paced which in the new age of film/viewers fast is good. I'm now waiting for The Bourne Ultimatum, the Bourne movies make me say ""move over Bond, we want Bourne"".",The Bourne Supremacy
420,eoliveri,"See it, even though it's not as good as the first one",7,23 July 2004,"The car chases are not as exciting, there is no romance after the first 15 minutes, the plot is transparent as well as thin, and the characters are cliches.  The acting is good, considering the drecky script, although sometimes, the background scenery is more interesting than what's going on in the foreground. Nevertheless, it succeeds as a summer thriller.  Just don't expect the same quality as the original.",The Bourne Supremacy

Great story, great scenes, and then a f.... up camera! :-(Paul Greengrass must have been inspired by the danish dogme-directors or something, since almost every shot was made by a guy running along Daemon with a hand-held camera. The result being brilliant action scenes, where you spent most of the time trying to get a bearing instead of enjoying the filming.I would wish for two version DVD-edition of this movies: one with the dogme-camera and one without.

422,G-Natural,a stunning and compelling thrill ride - better than original,10,24 July 2004,"First, I just have to get this off my chest -- was that REALLY Franka Potente? I thought for *** sure *** that was a different actress until I got home and looked it up here. I don't know if it was the hair or the different setting or what, but she just didn't look like the same girl to me.Okay, anyway, having said that...This movie kicked major booty. Matt Damon did a bang-up job as disillusioned ex-CIA operative Jason Bourne. And lets not make any bones about it - while there was decent acting all around, this movie is all about Bourne. His motivations, his passion, his anger, his frustration. And his undeniable penchant for squeezing out of tough situations with relentless abandon.I won't play spoiler here, but I would say that Damon's Bourne has a lot in common with Denzel Washington's intense ""Man on Fire"" portrayal, in the sense that both men are driven by personal feelings into extreme circumstances.The plot, while not necessarily as clandestine or cryptic as the first ""Mission Impossible"" film, could be a bit confusing if you're not paying attention. Of course, this film doesn't shove its exposition down your throat, which is a good thing. The conclusion, while not a typical shoot 'em up showdown, is emotionally fulfilling;  it still leaves room for more to come in ""The Bourne Ultimatum."" Add to that some pretty cool fight scenes and a car chase that -- dare I say -- improves on ""The French Connection,"" and you've got yourself a fine film.",The Bourne Supremacy
423,mdud,"Please sir, can I have some more?",9,23 August 2004,"Okay, so lets get the criticisms out of the way first; the acting's a little wooden and the director does an annoyingly successful job of trying to shake the camera around as much as possible when there's anything remotely acion based.There, that's it, I'm done!I came out of the cinema and my friend turned around to me and asked what I thought and, having just recovered from the slight nausea of the aforementioned shaky-cam, I laid out those two criticism. His reaction? ""Man, if they were the worst you could say about this film then you must have really liked it.""Then it dawned on me and slowly the smile spread across my face and as I hit the bottom step of the exit to the cinema I turned to my fiancée and beamed ""I REALLY like that film!!""The first film impressed me because for every scene there was a twist in my opinion, every scene ended differently to how you thought it might. Okay sure, the overall plot was a little predictable (not meant harshly) but every individual scene impressed until the sum of the scenes became more than the sum of the film - does that make any sense to anyone else?I think it's the same with the sequel, each scene is well crafted and impresses over and over again. We are thrown into the action from the start and the plot is thrown in as and when it's required. They have decided to reinvent the wheel with this one, they stuck to a winning formula and I for one cannot wait for part 3 which must inevitably happen.I just hope that the director doesn't attempt to film the action scenes by encouraging a troop of gibbons to throw a camera around as much as possible. It just made me think that the choreography isn't up to much and he was trying to hide it BUT I really don't think that that was the case. I would just part with: let us SEE what's going on next time!Overall, not bad at all!",The Bourne Supremacy

In this case though, a second gripping thriller has joined the franchise. Matt Damon reprises his role as Jason Bourne in fine style. Nevertheless, I personally feel that the film fell a little short of the superb standard set by The Bourne Identity. The jerky camera and disjointed editing were perhaps just a little bit too much. I appreciate that these techniques were employed to add atmosphere and to assist in the delivery of the necessary twists in the plot.

425,NRGWasp,"The Rock, Vin Diesel, Arnold Schwarzenegger take heed...",9,25 July 2004,"The Bourne Supremacy is everything an action-packed, gadget-filled, butt-kicking action film should be. The story is superb... maybe even better than the original, the action is intense, and the pacing is quick. There's never a dull moment. 'Supremacy' is smart, quick, and exciting. All those Arnold Schwarzenegger, Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson (The Rock), James Bond vehicles should be ashamed of themselves.Matt Damon returns as infinitely-more-compelling-than-James-Bond super spy Jason Bourne. Set two years after 'Identity', Bourne is forced out of hiding to once again protect himself and Marie from shadowy bureaucrats and possibly Bourne's own shadowy past. 'Supremacy' is grittier, darker, more suspenseful than 'Identity'. Bourne seems more desperate and has more difficulty eluding his would-be captors, and the film is better for it.The one problem I have with the film, and it seems I'm not alone on this, is that the hand-held camera work is atrocious. Thankfully most of the camera work is steady, but some of the more action-filled scenes shake uncontrollably. So much so that it's hard to focus on what's happening. This prevents me from giving an otherwise flawless action flick a perfect score.9/10",The Bourne Supremacy

Joan Allen convincing. Great chase in Moscow everyone will say. believable plot. Able to hold me and not stretch my attention span or credibility. Screenplay really good. Lively. Damon strong and good support roles. Fast moving. Could just about believe the central idea within the CIA. Probably too many cities covered in the plot. Liked the story line and different from the first one but echoed it too. Wanted Bourne to win! So in that sense the producer succeeded. I was not bored at all. Lively and fast paced.

The whole movie just had a blah feeling to it. It was very slow. The jumpy picture image really started to distract me after a while, I could barely enjoy the movie because of that. The best scene that everyone was talking about.... the chase scene through the city..... turned out to be just average. It wasn't terrible, just okay exciting, nothing groundbreaking.

I also saw it on a plane so maybe that had an effect. The second continues the same trend with even *less* character development. But, wait, there's good chase scenes, so that must be alright. I guess I should be satisfied with that and then leave alone the weird gender dynamics with Bourne alternately searching for Mommy-, lover-, or sister-salvation in the female characters. Oh wait, that's the character development. I get it. A decent money-maker for all involved just not what I would call a movie. Too bad because the chase scenes are very stimulating and exciting.",The Bourne Supremacy
429,aregynski,"Great action flick, not quite on par for first installment",9,26 July 2004,"In the ""Bourne Supremacy"", Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) must once again fend off constant attacks from assassins, police, agents and various other areas of law enforcement.  Of course, they are no match for Bourne's expertise in climbing, running, magazine-whipping, jumping,driving or ability to work a toaster.  The only problems I had with this movie was the herky-jerky camera style that Greengrass uses when it comes to fights.  This technique does do itself justice later in film with a spectacular car chase.  One of the things I like about these films are the amount of time Bourne goes along without dialogue.  He spends much of his time thinking quickly before he acts.  I love the scenes where he pulls out a map and scans over in a blink for an exit strategy.  These are scenes that separate Bourne from others. However, there is another assassin after him in this movie who seems as if he knows where everyone is going before they do.  Don't want to make it too easy for Bourne to dispense all comers in a few swift moves.  All the usual characters show up in ""B.S"", including a few bit players Nikki (Julia Stiles) and the tall skinny guy with short buzzed hair (don't know his name).  All of these actors give the show continuity.  Very good is Joan Allen as Agent Landy, an agent who is out of the loop before two of her agents are supposedly killed by Bourne.  Her sparring with the senior staff in the CIA is another subplot of the film.   Overall a good film, could have used better direction during the fights where I couldn't tell what was going on half the time.  Can't wait for the ""Bourne Ultimatum"".",The Bourne Supremacy

So, that really pretty much killed it for me. I recommend waiting for video. Or, if you must see it in the theatre, save a couple of dollars by seeing a matinee.And as a final note -- I would be happier had they just stopped with the Bourne Identity.

For some viewers, this staccato will become a major distraction and annoyance.The chase scene is thrilling, well done for the most part, but goes on far too long and loses some validity as a result.Stay tuned for yet another, for there is still a villain outstanding on the Russian side, which will provide a sedgway for yet another offering.",The Bourne Supremacy

435,Darth_Nebuchadnezzar,No need to see 'Identity' after realizing 'Supremacy' of second...,9,23 July 2004,"""The Bourne Supremacy"" is an action packed thrill ride and spy flick all wrapped around a simple, confused, amnesia-stricken man trying to find his way in the world while dodging fellow assassins, CIA officials and his framed crimes...Now, I decided to give this film a hesitant 9/10 instead of an 8...here's why it received a 9...and why it was a hesitant 9. 
Matt Damon reprises his role as the former-CIA-employed assassin, Jason Bourne.  Bourne is still searching for justification to his thoughts and visions while still trying to cope with the realizations of what they might mean.  Damon himself is very good as Bourne, a nice increase from his part in 'Identity', although he was good in that as well.  There are moments when Bourne must rely on his primal instincts on the spot to find out just what he is going to do next and how he is going to stay that instrumental step ahead of his followers.  In these moments, Damon really shines brightly as the deeply methodical and deadly Bourne.  The rest of the cast does very well at keeping up with Damon's fast paced but disturbed performance.  Most noteworthy is Simon Cox as Ward Abbot.  The great thing about Cox's character is that you never really know whether or not he is trying to defend Bourne...trying to kill Bourne...or trying to defend Bourne in order to defend himself.  It is this kind of shenanegan that brings ""Supremacy"" its greatest triumph. Most of the events that occur within the timeline of the film are somewhat routine and have been done in other films to a certain extent, but the great characterization that follows the preferably-action-before-words Bourne and the intertwining, ever escalating plot keeps each event fresh and gives it that nice boost of energy and charisma that this movie really deserves. ""Supremacy"" is so good at keeping the audience in tact and allowing them to attempt to figure the events, the plot and the characters out before it is finally revealed to the audience that I did not lose interest in this film once during its entire duration...a whopping one hour and fifty-five minutes.  One thing that I really liked and enjoyed realizing was the shaky camera movements whenever Jason Bourne was in a shot.  It represents just how unstable his life and mind have become, and especially how unstable Bourne is during this phase of his life.  Bourne himself is not a borderline psychotic, but doesn't reserve himself from punching down a field officer if he has to.  Bourne is deeply methodical and I really found it intriguing that he can pull himself away from his own delusions and memories to focus on the moment.  It shows just how smart and cunning Jason Bourne is. 
Another great thing is the pacing of this film.  Even in its slow moments, ""Supremacy"" is wonderfully fast-paced.  It is a very quickly-paced film, but the audience has no need to struggle in keeping up with it...masterful pacing to say the least.  The action sequences are dazzlingly fast and work superbly well, although there is a fight scene that gets a little too caught up in its own momentum and the audience does lose track of exactly who has the knife, who just got poked in the eye...that sort of thing.  In truth, however, that pace and uncertainty about it adds to the suspense of it all.Now, for what is bad about ""Supremacy"", and I must say, there isn't much. The characters outside of Bourne and the three main supporters aren't exceptionally deep, and the audience has to rely on not much more than the actor's faces to keep them separated.  Some of Bourne's visions are so fast that many of the audience members digging through popcorn bags will miss anything important shown in them...the visions are supposed to be fast, but lets keep the demographic in mind, here, shall we?  As mentioned earlier...the fight scene that moves exceptionally quickly is hard to follow...yes, the winner is determined after a few moments so there is no reason to panic, but it still brings nostalgia of those old Godzilla films where the two monsters clashed so close to the screen that the viewer couldn't make out just what was going on.  All in all, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is well worth viewing for a measly eight dollars.  A nice step up from the original where the entire film is a giant chase and the audience gets a real sense of being paranoid and being on their toes.  Again, 9/10.",The Bourne Supremacy
436,buzzbunney,Supremely annoying camera work and film editing.,5,9 December 2004,"Camera tricks do not make a movie.The cinematographer of this film should be locked in a room with a 35mm camera, a tripod and a bowl of fruit. And see if he can learn how to take clear interesting pictures. This visually fractured and unrealistic presentation looks like the work of a speed freak or a someone with an advanced palsy condition. There is no moment in the film where the director,(who clearly shares in blame for this panic fest) allows his actors to seduce the camera and thereby generating genuine interest. Instead he relies on ultra rapid cutting to create a false sense of tension and suspense.The fight scenes, may as well been computer generated. They are nearly unintelligle, due to their obviously accelerated, and visually disoriented presentation.Bring back the original team.",The Bourne Supremacy
437,harry_smyth,Top notch performance from Matt Damon.,9,22 July 2005,"If anyone previously had any reason to doubt the acting ability of Damon, this is the perfect film to demonstrate his quality. He is absolutely superb in what is certainly a very demanding role. To achieve the degree of believability which he attains is perhaps his greatest achievement. The action moves at a furious pace but the director still finds time to further develop all the characters from the prequel which is impressive. For me this is a superior film to the Bourne Identity as it is impossible to take your eyes off the screen due to its compelling nature. It is also brilliant the way the story moves effortlessly across Europe and this enhances our understanding of the intelligence world in a thoroughly realistic fashion. This is one of the best thrillers of the last ten years and i would strongly recommend it to any fan of the genre. 9/10",The Bourne Supremacy
438,criticus1,"A shaky cam of goons, boring meetings, and saying ""Bourne!"" a lot",2,20 August 2008,"Matt Damon returns as the near mute superspy Jason Bourne in the Bourne Supremacy *Ha!* The only thing this movie is supreme at is making lanky actors look like assassins by shaking the camera so much you can only guess someone is being punched by the sound fx. Every hand to hand melee is filmed like the camera was taped to a motorboat engine and put on full throttle. It's annoying and I'm surprised Greengrass dialed it even higher in the sequel. Seriously the camera even shivers during simple questioning scenes. I can only assume to leave some editing room for the director to put in some punching sounds in case he wanted to turn Bourne's very words into invisible boxing gloves that can take out those over-the-hill interrogators.Remember those James Bond knockoffs from the 70's that had the main actor go through a series of generic action challenges just to prove to the audience that the character was as good as James Bond? Well, Bourne goes through the same dance steps like a kid doing his dad's dance routine. Except this kid doesn't realize he looks like a dweeb. Supremacy carries the false identity of all those older knockoff films, and expects us to overlook this badly disguised spy movie. Matt Damon barely has to spout out any lines because the movie is on rails. This movie plain old uses the time tested spy checklist for the story. Nameless hit-man with no dramatic arc? Check. Car chase? Check. (With junky Euro go cars nonetheless.) Overly-romantic subplot with cranky girlfriend? Check. Experienced government officials terrified of the ultimate spy who can walk out of any detainment, even police stations? Check. Said spy having amnesia over his mysterious past which he receives in ever-revealing and eye popping flashbacks triggered by infiltrating a network of creeps? Check. Been there. Done that. Even the ol' snap the gas line in the apartment as the bad guys rush in is used here. You would think that by now movie goons would be careful not to enter into section apartments using natural gas lines. Must be horrible for normal folks who, say, have a gas leak, have lost their sense of smell and burn their toast or something cause the house is bound to explode. The only thing surprising is the new girl brought into the story by way of Julia Stiles, who is a government psych assistant who does nothing but cry because she's still an intern, basically. I think she looks up one file in the whole movie and between the regulatory mumbo jumbo you realize that's her purpose. To kitten talk Bourne and to read a file everyone probably has read in this agency. But even more irritating is the fact that she looks like she could be the sister of Bourne's last girlfriend!Anyway the cast of government agents chasing Bourne do little more than setup an HQ, kiss Bourne's butt, then move the HQ somewhere else when Bourne evades their grasp. While they're at HQ they spend their time talking about technical procedures and saying the name Bourne every three sentences. The dialogue would go something like this: Joan Allen: ""We need to put out a communique to the French consulate for a wire tap. For Bourne."" Brian Cox ""Bourne is not just another target. Bourne is like a wildcat with claws of fire."" The script does disservice to heavy hitters like Brian Cox and Joan Allen when all it gives their characters to do is stand around weaving myths of Jason Bourne like he's freakin' Gilgamesh. I like Joan Allen as an actress. It's sad to see her in a role that basically treats her like a secretary trying to avoid retirement. A little irony in that I'm writing this on Joan Allen's birthday. Oh well, I'm pretty sure I've forgotten major turning points in the plot. I don't really mind though. Between all the editing spasms I barely remember that Matt Damon's in it at all.",The Bourne Supremacy

I can't believe they've been able to stretch this out for three more sequels. Leave me a gun on the desk Me. Bourne.,The Bourne Supremacy
440,joeslev,Very enjoyable - 8/10,8,7 January 2006,"""The Bourne Supremacy"" is an action film, which is the sequel to 2002's ""The Bourne Identity"". It is directed by Paul Greengrass, and follows the story of Jason Bourne, an ex-CIA agent, who was part of a hit squad called tretstone. At the start of the film we see Bourne trying to get away from his old life in India, but is dragged back in after being framed for the murder of two other CIA agents in Berlin.Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne in a gritty largely silent manner, and convinces as the cold blooded killer, especially in the way he goes about his business, with ruthless close quarters combat. Overall i would say it is an excellent turn from Matt Damon, and very different to many of his other performances. This is almost the opposite to a James Bond film, and it is a lot more serious. There are no cheesy one-liners or distracting love interests for Bourne, and this demonstrates how focused the character is. Instead of glossy sunny locations as in most action films, Greengrass chooses to represent the many cities involved as gritty bustling metropolises, especially Berlin where much of the film takes place. This film is on a large scale and other countries featured are England, Italy, the US and Holland. This shows the story is on a global level. There are also good action sequences, on a smaller level than in other action films like ""Mission impossible 2"", but in someways more exciting, as demonstrated in a thrilling car chase towards the climax of the movie.In conclusion - the plot is interesting, and has many twists and turns which keep the viewers attention. There are conspiracies, double crossings, and a web of murders builds up. It is one of the best action movies of recent times.8/10",The Bourne Supremacy
441,thegeneralJDE,"Brilliant. I applaud you, Greengrass.",9,1 January 2006,"Unfortunately, I saw this film before I saw Identity, but I think that carried me as a member of the audience along with Bourne's life. I did find the plot confusing (for obvious reasons) but I rated this film as 'epic' by my standards because it really is. It contained all the factors I wished for in a film of its type. First of all, I have to congratulate Matt Damon on his unfaltering performance, secondly, Paul Greengrass on brilliant direction on the film, and thirdly, Tony Gilroy on his screenplay. The film beautifully creates the character of Bourne and his 'journey of self-discovery'. What I particularly liked was the lack of clichés - something I think can really destroy movies. The script was good, the direction was brilliant and overall the film is truly an epic. Although, I was surprised by the ending - I've heard that there is another book, so why did Greengrass finish the film on 'the middle c', as I like to say? It seemed to me that the story was wrapped up, and so I'm looking forward to what the third film will be like (I haven't read the books). Then again, Identity did the same sort of thing. The start I think took some time to get off the ground, and although you do have the chase scenes and Bourne's girlfriend's death (everybody say ahh), the pace of the beginning was a bit sluggish. Beat me to death if you think otherwise, but I was tired that night.Feel good movie all the way. Surprising really, because I actually prefer thinker movies. Nonetheless, The Bourne Supremacy's in my top ten.",The Bourne Supremacy
442,wreednelson,Gladly more of the same-high tension and international flavor,9,19 January 2007,"Again, Jason Bourne is the real super-spy. While the Bond franchise and other projects with similar influences cross way over the reality threshold, Bourne is easier to swallow. You don't walk out of the theater laughing about the improbability of some scenes. Where the first movie starts stormy and icy, this movie starts warm and cozy. This is a nice trick, because there is never a calm day for a real CIA operative. Who do you trust? Not a soul. Who could be after you? Just about anyone, including your own (ex) colleagues. The Bourne series has actually made me more aware of my surroundings. I take everything in that I can. Bourne's world is crazy, but so is ours. After watching this series, who can get ""comfortable?"" Hey, it beats boredom!!!",The Bourne Supremacy
443,enash,another good movie ruined by the camera work,7,8 August 2004,"Is it just lazy film making or do they really think the awful camera work is arty? This was a good movie with great acting, well written but unwatchable.During the first 15 minutes I kept moving back in the theater hoping that would help. The camera work made me feel like I was in the front row, blurry and out of focus with the close ups way to close. The action scenes were so choppy it just makes me think the film maker is to lazy to film a cohesive scene, this method has got to make the editing process easy work.During the pointless to long car chase scene it wasn't enough to close my eyes but I had to put my hands over my eyes to keep the headache inducing flicking away.When will they get over their selves???",The Bourne Supremacy
444,lgilbert2,"This film creates artificial excitement with choppy camera work. Without this artifice, the film is ordinary.",5,5 August 2004,"Did you ever watch the original ""Riverdance""? Camera shots were prolonged so you could see continuity of action and enjoy the beauty of the movement.
Contrast that with the current Michael Flatley videos. He creates an aura of excitement by changing cameras as often as twice a second. Also his cameras are so close to the action that one cannot view the symmetry and coordination. It is like watching through a soda straw.Well, Borne Supremacy carries the camera work beyond this extreme. There is little compelling dialogue. The claim to fame is a great deal of action. Unfortunately, the camera work on this action is so choppy that the film is very hard to watch. Scenes are on the screen for less than a second. Worse than that, no cameras are stabilized. When a person is running, the camera bobs up and down with each step of the runner. Even worse, the cameras seem to be inches away from the subject so there is no continuity of background, or a stable visual reference with which to put the action in context.In my opinion, the action scenes were ordinary, but artificially made exciting by not letting you look at a full scene. Summary: If you like dazzle, eye candy, and viewing the world through a soda straw, this is the movie for you.",The Bourne Supremacy
445,JohnRayJr,"Smart, taut writing clashes with incoherent fighting",6,24 July 2004,"I went to see The Bourne Supremacy with high expectations. 2002's ""The Bourne Identity"" was one of the best action-spy-intrigue movies in years, and the critics were touting ""The Bourne Supremacy"" as a worthy sequel - one notch up from the original. Like another highly praised sequel (Spiderman 2), I would put it a notch down. In both cases, that's not exactly harsh criticism.What separated the ""The Bourne Identity"" from its well-worn genre was a combination of a complex and engaging story, taut writing, and most importantly, solid directing, particularly with regard to the combat scenes between Jason Bourne and his various antagonists. We were spared elaborate martial arts choreography plunging rhythmically in and out of slow motion. Instead, the fights were brutal and short: if Bourne's opponents were unsuspecting policemen, they were quickly dispatched; if they were fellow Treadstone operatives, then blows were exchanged with lightning-quick staccato. These were men trying to kill each other, and they fought with mechanical determination. But at least the camera staid still long enough for us to SEE what was going on. In ""The Bourne Supremacy,"" the complex and engaging story as well as the taut writing are both still in place. It is the action that disappoints. The new director, Paul Greengrass, is clearly going for a similar effect, but his method leaves a lot to be desired. Basically, he changes camera takes so fast that what you see is almost a series of still images. You have no real sense of the fight, and the familiar sound that accompanies body blows is timed so that it coincides with the shifting of the camera. It is a cheap way out: it only creates the feel of a fight without the substance. If you try to reconstruct it after you see it, all you will remember is that Bourne and whoever were fighting, instead of the fight itself. There is something to be said for quick and disorienting camera work that mimics quick and disorienting violence. But this effect is lost to incoherence in ""The Bourne Supremacy."" The movie's climactic car chase (which the New York Times reviewer called one of the three or four best ever filmed) suffers from the same problems. You constantly see the moment of collision between cars, and split-second shots of Bourne's feet on the gas/brake/clutch pedals, but you don't actually see a coherent chase. Not only that, in a movie where the violence itself tends toward realism (Bourne hurts his leg jumping from a height of about 20 feet, etc), the damage sustained by Bourne's car in the final chase would have demolished it two or three times over. Sure, there is such as thing as suspension of disbelief. But one of the main strengths of both ""Bourne"" movies is that they veer away from the excesses of action flicks in the last several years (think: Mission Impossible 2). Had the rest of the film consistently portrayed a world where people and objects endure an inflated amount of damage, then the final chase would have been unremarkable. As it is, it stands out, and not as the crowning finale. I would still recommend this movie over pretty much every action movie that has been released since ""The Bourne Identity"" in 2002. But sadly, it falls noticeably short of its potential. 7/10",The Bourne Supremacy
446,SyberHunterX,Kept my attention,9,23 July 2004,"I saw this movie early on the first day, and it kept my attention throughout. There are a couple of minor flaws in the movie, but that's negotiable through the twists and turns of this spy movie/psychological thriller. The one time I almost left to go to the bathroom, the credits started to roll. Now that I know what I missed by not seeing the first one, the reason being is because Matt Damon didn't match who I felt was a good choice for Jason Bourne, so I have some catching up to do. The direction was odd in the sense that I felt it needed more in the way of pans and cuts, not bumpy handhelds and short cuts of steadycams. It takes when you think you know about Jason Bourne, answers a few questions, provides some more, and leaves room for the next one. I recommend this as a good date film.",The Bourne Supremacy

There were cuts about every few seconds during the first car chase and during many other scenes. The camera work was extremely shaky and made this a horrible film.I found this movie incredibly boring. While the first movie was exciting and had many good action scenes, this movie was just dull and pointless. There are no good action scenes and I found the ending car chase in Russia extremely boring and way to long. The action scenes during the middle of the movie were also very boring This was one of the worst movies I had ever seen. Do not see this movie unless you have nothing else do to.",The Bourne Supremacy
448,brianakarobin,Great movie - despite the nauseating action sequences!,9,29 July 2004,"First off, I really enjoyed the Bourne Identity, and if you didn't like that one, than you probably won't like this either. I found the movie excellent, with a good plot and Matt Damon is again excellent as the torn former assassin Jason Bourne. I won't go into the plot, as I don't want to spoil anything, but the one thing I will say in a negative light is that all of the action sequences, and a few other scenes, are shot with hand held (i.e unsteady) cameras, and this nauseates me, literally. Not only does it make the action hard to follow, but it makes me sick. Not quite as bad as the Blair Witch Project in this regard, but the same idea. Fortunately, most of the scenes are with traditional steady cameras. I realize the director has a taste for hand held cameras, but using them for action sequences is a waste of a well-choreographed action sequence, as you can't see anything. However, the movie was excellent, and I recommend it.3.5/4",The Bourne Supremacy

HE GOT HIT BY A SEMI TRUCK AND WALKED FROM, NO HE DROVE AWAY AFTER GETTING HIT.!!!!MAJOR SPOILER!!! His girlfriend dies and he just goes on. there was almost no depression nothing i mean if my girlfriend died i would have been crying, thinking about her everything but no he just burns everything about her and goes on.To put it simple if you like the first movie you'll love the second but if you can See clearly you will hate this movie along with the first.",The Bourne Supremacy
450,zdelna,I liked it.,7,14 January 2016,"The sequel is basically more of the same, but it's a welcome return in my opinion, as cinema needs films that are different to the majority. It's also a good thing as I'm a big fan of Matt Damon. It's unfair that he should continue to get lumped in with Ben Afleck due to their friendship as he has a lot of talent and I think that the fact he's gone for more art orientated films as opposed to the dumb blockbusters his friend was drawn to like a moth to the light shows that he has a genuine respect for cinema. He stars as the title character; Jason Bourne, who, like the film itself is hardly your average action fare. He doesn't utter one liners shortly before or after blowing someone away, nor does he spend most of the movie trying to look cool; espionage is the order of the day and it works very well in the context of the film.Because it's plot heavy, The Bourne Supremacy requires the viewer to watch, and the large amount of talking goes some way to distancing this from most other action movies. However, this could also be seen as a bad point as it can, at times, hinder the movie in the excitement stakes and make it difficult viewing for those that do like their action. The movie spans across Europe to a number of different countries including Germany, Britain, France and Russia and this keeps it exciting as it allows the landscape of the movie to change constantly and the film doesn't dwell in the same area. In fact, the film is very efficient on the whole and it never overindulges in anything, which compensates for the amount of talking and allows it to be exciting. Despite it being more stealthy than most, time is still found for a number of high-octane sequences including fist-fights, explosions and a great car chase that looks as if it could have been lifted straight out of Grand Theft Auto.",The Bourne Supremacy
451,graham-319-209399,Couldn't afford a Steadicam?,6,14 August 2020,"Loved the plot, loved the acting - just what you'd want from a spy/thriller/action movie, Mission Impossible meets James Bond. Great.But, by heck, they needed a steadicam on this one.Almost every shot is done hand-held, whether it's needed or not. Sure, do it in the fast-cut action bits for a sense of confusion meets speed, but hold the damn thing still if it's a simple bit of dialog between two characters in a meeting, out for a coffee or a stroll in the park.
Documentary style is fine in the right circumstances, but not combined with fast cuts even in slow scenes. Bad timing throughout. Film school teacher says ""1/10... see me after class.""
Even in the action sequences it's a bit much. You don't need to cut an action movie like a pop video (even if this one wasn't even cut on a beat I could discern, it was all a bit random in the edit timings).
Bam//Flicker/Bam/Bam/Wobble/Wobble/Blur.
Michael Bay is well-known for his 'wth is going on' editing, but even he can slow the camera down when needed. Greengrass just doesn't seem to understand camera pacing at all.

He grabs the audience at the throat after few moments of prelude and doesn't let go till the very end... Jason Bourne takes us for a furious ride all over the Europe, proving that James Bond is a piece of cake... Damon feels the character he plays perfectly and pushes the plot to the limits of reality. Smashing soundtrack only sharpens the dynamic picture and makes the viewers a part of the game. Scenes of combat are maybe not as rousing as they are in ""the Bourne identity"", but the car chase is just masterpiece. I hope the next ""Bourne"" movie will be at lest as good as previous ones.

Matt Damon, Franka Potente, and Julia Stiles star in this film and their performances are all strong especially Julia Stiles' for the little time she has. The story is smarter than the first and it has better twists. The only real problem it has is the plot drags in the middle and the shaky and choppy editing is a little overwhelming in moments (sometimes it's hard to tell what is going on). It's a good movie but its not really my type of movie but many, many people would love it.

I'm really sorry to see Greengrass is doing the threequel. There are so many scenes that just drag on without any thing in particular happening, particularly in all but the last car chase. This is made all the more irritating by music that should be accompanied by better action. Imagine James Bond sitting in on the can reading the sports page accompanied by McCartneys ""Live and Let Die"". Some of the dialogue was pretty awkward, almost like it was ad libbed. There are few fight scenes and none were as slick as those in BI. Overall the movie just lacked the tension of the first. Brian Cox gives a dreadful performance as Ward Abbot, surprising since he did pretty well in the first. Joan Allen gave the best performance but it wasn't enough to save the movie. Bringing back so many of the characters from BI, even minor players, seemed almost gratuitous. Also missing was the quick thinking-on-his-feet from Jason Bourne that really set the first apart. This movie would be fine for TV. I'd watch it. But I expect more when I rent something.",The Bourne Supremacy

Being a fan of the novel I can only be disappointed by the lack of human contact with the character of Jason Bourne as on paper we learn a lot about him and what he's going through, but this is an action movie and the car chase and the fight scenes alone are worth the miss.

There was quite a bit of difference between the book and the movie, but there was also quite a bit of similarity. Having said that, this 2nd installment - with the death of Maria - takes a completely different turn, and the similarities to the book are for the most gone. Bourne's relationship with Maria was motivational for the character to keep going on, and now that she is gone, he is a completely different character. I don't see anyway that the 3rd movie will be recognizable as a growth from the same soil as the Ludlum books, and I could see where fans of the books might be disappointed. So it seems to me that fans of the books who are purists are the ones who will vote this movie lower. I think that this new direction brings with it new possibilities. Not worse or better, but definitely different. And I thought the books were great, but I look forward to seeing where this new direction might lead.

462,Articulated_Jaw,Brainy yet also hard-hitting action thriller,10,25 July 2004,"The Bourne Supremacy is a sequel that both manages to retain a certain tightly-edited/European/no-nonsense feel from its predecessor and yet move in a very different direction in story, emotional outlook, and style of action. Supremacy is darker, faster, more serious, and even leaner than The Bourne Identity, which is quite a feat.Many of those strong elements (emotion, style, leanness) are helped by the deliberate use of a ""you are there"" hand-held camera. I and those around me felt like we were IN the fight in the townhouse, we all felt like WE were getting bashed about in the car-chases, we all felt we were there. And the movie almost literally hits hard...much of the audience all looked around at each other with wide eyes after the car chase, just as people do after an especially rough wooden-build roller-coaster ride.This camera also puts an even finer point on the lethality of Jason Bourne. By making it feel like you are right there, it at times almost makes you feel like a helpless witness, trusting Bourne not to completely destroy what are sometimes relative innocents around him while at the same time you can't (and could never) do a thing about it. One such intense scene with Julia Stiles even manages to bring out evidence of honest acting ability on Stiles' part.The Bourne/Damon combo proves yet again to be the best thing to hit action/thriller movies in a very long time. Damon exudes intelligence as usual but also now provides a believable example of a fit yet average-sized ""everyman"" character that is neither an obvious martial artist or a hulking weight-lifting brute, yet can stealthily erupt from the quiet and devastate them both...maybe even at once. Matt Damon seems perfect for this, as many have come to agree.There are also the scarce but important moments of humanity that only a potent actor can pull off for the Bourne character, and here Damon is even more successful. To say much more about any part of this story would be spoilers, but safe to say the movie begins and ends with a requirement for emotional acting that someone who is ONLY an action star simply could not pull off.Adding to the excellence are strong performances from critical favorites such as Joan Allen and Brian Cox. Franka Potente also returns as Marie, Bourne's German girlfriend from the first movie, though her role takes on a new significance here.Very highly recommended movie that will make you think, beat you up as though you're there, and leave you exiting the theater quietly wide-eyed after not only absorbing the spectacle but also the well-crafted quiet emotional moment bookending it. And then you'll want more.",The Bourne Supremacy
463,gt-24,Use a tripod!,7,25 July 2004,"For the most part, the plot and action sequences are good, although it's one of those movies where the director wants to make the audience feel as if it's part of the action, rather than observing. So, much of the time, you can only tell that it's a (insert fight, car chase, shootout here) but since the camera moves so much, you can't tell much more than that. Again, I understand the director is trying to make the audience feel uncomfortable, quickening the pace, etc etc... my only question is why? Didn't that trick fade out of style about 1998?Walking out of the movie, I felt borderline queasy, the kind of feeling you get getting off the Zipper at the fair. At first, I thought the shaky, hand-held camera-work was a part of the initial sequence, thinking it would go away. But no! It's there the entire length of the film.Joan Allen is smart and sexy, a far cry from the housewife in Face/Off. Matt Damon is also good, and proves himself a much better actor than his buddy Affleck (again). And Julia Stiles makes a nice turn, expanding on her role from the first film. Of course there are some plot holes and some coincidences that make you roll your eyes slightly, but it's a summer blockbuster, what do you expect?Overall a quality sequel, but if you get motion sick, wait for video so you can hit pause.",The Bourne Supremacy

The new director Greengrass did a fantastic job and looking forward to his next film he directs. Now the performances were superb. Matt Damon made me remember what a great actor he is( each film always reminds me how good of an actor he is, with the exceptions of Stuck on You and The Legend of Bagger Vance). Joan Allen was perfect for Pamela Landy, she is always good and this was a fantastic role for her. The surprise performance(for me) was Julia Stiles. Her work, in my opinion, has never been consistent, Her performances range from good(Ten Things I Hate About You) to misguided(Mona Lisa Smile).

This movie, directed by a new director, is given a different yet extremely exciting feel to it. The casting is still great, with Matt Damon bringing a deadpan portrayal to the Bourne character. Hes very good in this role, which commits a great success to the whole of the movie. Supporting players Brian Cox and Julia Styles, along with newcomer Joan Allen, all provide stellar support for Bourne. The action is intense and really well done, and the plot is thrilling and will surprise you quite a bit. The camera-work is extremely fast paced, and overall it has a gritty, captivating style. With all of these elements together, you got one great action thriller that in many cases even surpasses Identity! Movies like this are hard to come by, in todays times with many action pictures that just don't work and become tedious.

I held much expectations haven read the Bourne books by Ludlum and I must say that I probably shouldn't have. Not only does the movie Bourne Supremacy have nothing in common with the book The Bourne Supremacy (from which it is supposed to be based) but they replaced the story with a really flat screen play. Not only this but the direction and camera work are amateur. The soundtrack happens to be almost an exact duplicate of The Bourne Identity (having the same ending song) which is not very fun. I bought the movie without seeing it beforehand because I new what it could have been after seeing the first and reading the books. Shame on the screen play writers and director for turning one of my most favorite action stories into another mess of ""let's just make a really flashy movie, who cares about the story"" film. Recommendations:If you seen and liked The Bourne Identity - Rent this If you seen and disliked The Bourne Identity - Avoid this If you like to read good books - Read the Bourne trilogy by Robert Ludlum (I don't really read Ludlum but, I really like these books) not only will you have a great adventure but, you'll see what could have been...5/10 (compared to the 8/10 I gave The Bourne Identity)",The Bourne Supremacy

Very rapid, jerky panning and over use of zoom lenses during the action scenes. I know that Hollywood must be attempting to cut costs however; they should revert to using equipment that utilizes ""steady cam"" technology. The scenes mentioned are so jerky that it made watching the movie almost nauseating.For the life of me, I cannot understand why the practice of showing non-supported video that appears to be taking by a 5 year old (which seemed to be initiated on NYPD Blue), has continued. If you want to watch a movie that may possibly make you nauseous or at the least, give you a headache due to the camera sequences mentioned above, then by all means, this is your movie.

The problem is the book. The story centers around Jason Bourne, who is hunted by a ""super-powerful"" government agency for no apparent reason. Also, his personality is broken, he is haunted by bad dreams and flashbacks of his past as an assassin killer for said government agency.The movie turns, when the hunted transforms into a hunter, finding out who hunts him and going for revenge.At the midst of the movie, suddenly the story gets re-written towards a direction of ""oh, its not about you, actually its about some random thing that you did in the past"", namely the assassination that bourne did in Berlin many years ago.This leads to a hunt-down of some Russian bad guys, inscenated as a 40 minute car chase and fist-fighting action-fest, without any enterntaining value nor well orchestration but pure usage of explosives and stunt-men.IF you liked Bourne Identity, watch only the first movie, which ends with two characters that lived through a serious story.

I know the beginning twist is sort of necessary, but it was sad a caught me by surprise. I sort of wonder what it would have been like had his wife not been killed, maybe they could have made her turn evil or she could have trained to be equally as bad ass.

Exceptional casting in this film, just like the first installment with a few characters carrying over. There is simply not any bad acting in this movie from anyone involved. They are all very believable in their roles.The storyline is as it is supposed to be, a continuance of ""Identity"" and therefore is on par with the first movie. The only complaint I had with the movie was the action sequences were a bit nauseating because of the camera-work being so shaky. I hope that they can find a way in the third installment to reduce that effect a bit or it might be better not to eat before the movie! Fortunately, the majority of the action sequences are over before I could get really sick. That being said, the car chase in this movie is one of the best ever filmed. Depite the shaky camera style, it is truly spectacular.There has been some debate among myself and fellow Bourne-O-Philes as to what happened to some Bourne's assassin counterparts in the interim between the first movie and the second, but it really does not affect the storyline. Instead it just makes guys like me lose sleep at night wondering where this character and that character ran off to.The cinematography (save for the shaky action scenes) is once again exceptional and sets the perfect mood for the story, using darkness and light to represent confusion and, toward the end, illumination. And this time the soundtrack is not only good, but exceptional. I even purchased the soundtrack separately which is something I rarely do. Too bad the star meter only goes to 10. I don't think that is high enough to record the level of enjoyment I gained from this film.",The Bourne Supremacy

I could not see nor understand what was happening. The same with the car chase in India except the lighting was better. This may be an attempt to liven up an action scene using rapid camera changes. When I watched the fight scene in Munich (again 2 second flashes filmed in extremely bad lighting) I stopped the movie and went to the credits. I wanted to see who was responsible for this spectacle and make sure that I don't waste my money on anything else he may direct. It could have been a good movie. It had a good plot and story line but the filming was horrible. If the director had held the camera shots for at least 5 to 10 seconds it would give your brain enough time to comprehend the images your eyes are sending it and put it together with some kind of continuity.,The Bourne Supremacy

I would estimate perhaps the take one idea from the book - thats about it - the name of the central character.And yes the books are way better than the hashed up contrived plots used in the films. Basically, the producers made the usual boring car chase, shooting, etc plot and then used the ""Bourne..."" titles to sell the films. Without that no one would have bothered to watch them.I hate it when producers do this. I mean what gives them the right to mess around with the books. Of course films have to be different - different media and time constraints. But in this case... I mean what were they thinking.The films are crap.

I've never read the original books by Robert Ludlum, but I heard people complaining that the movie is nowhere close to the books as it should be, but I think this is what an adaptation should be. The movie doesn't necessary have to follow closely to the books. It's hard to compress a several hundreds page book into a 2 hour and half movie or a 120 page script. Also, people may notice that the shaky camera technique is introduced to the movie, while the first movie, The Bourne Identity has static camera shots, and many people I have talked to say they didn't like the transformation. I don't seriously mind the shaky camera, but I rather welcome it. It helps that sense of realism in the movie. The Bourne Supremacy has some of the best foot and car chase scenes, and the soundtrack, composed by John Powell, goes really well with them. Matt Damon and Julia Stiles were also great in their roles. Matt Damon plays his role perfectly throughout the movie and Stiles really shine in one particular scene in the movie.

It's like he's stepped up a gear for this film ( which I thought would be difficult considering how good he was in the "" Identity"" )Julia Stiles puts in a good performance and she has more involvement than in the first film. The Joan Allen Character ( Pamela Landy ) works well to balance the so-far unquestioned pursuit of Bourne and makes the internal CIA conflict between herself and Brian Cox's character ( Ward ) make the plot more compelling as you're always wondering just how far Ward will be willing to go cover up the truth. The action sequences in this film are just as good as the first film ( possibly better ) Also, although the filming style + camera movement may be a little too quick and ""close up"" for some people's taste. I loved it, it adds to the realism and in some scenes, almost makes you feel like your right there with the character ( well almost ) .It's a shame that Marie ( Potente ) wasn't in it for long but I guess they decided it was necessary to for the plot development ( Bourne's extra motivation for revenge + seeking the truth etc ) This second film in the Bourne series continues to impress with great performances , gritty videography and a great soundtrack which also really contributes to the ambiance of the film.

But the cars on the street are European, the outside of the building is European, the inside of the apartment is European....you get my drift. The Berlin hotel is, well, a BERLIN HOTEL. It really makes all the difference. 2 minor flaws: I agree there is too much hand held camera work that moves around WAY too much. It kind of dilutes the fight scenes.

Way to go ahead & ruin the best new action franchise in recent movie history, buddy. What a truly awful exercise in jerky camera action this movie was!Let me get this out of the way...I am a very very big fan of the first movie. Even though most of the cast and the taut & compelling script about the quest of Jason Bourne for his identity return in the sequel, the movie is ruined by the camera jerking in every possible direction *every half second*, during the action sequences. This shaky camera action, used recently in the amazing ""24"" TV series, seems to be every director's favorite play toy now. And in a high-octane thriller like ""Supremacy.."", it ruins the whole movie for you. The recent ""Man on Fire"" was almost ruined by this technique but was saved because of Denzel's presence.What was so good about the ""Bourne Identity"" was that you got a bird's eye view of all the action. The camera is sitting still, high above the actors & you see everything they are doing. Imagine this: Instead of seeing how Jason scaled down the wall of the consulate & seeing how high he was & how dangerous a stunt it would be if tried in real life, you see quick cuts of Jason's fingers holding onto the bricks, of his eyes looking either way, of his nostrils flaring, etc. (not the whole scene but parts of the scene), all in quick half-second bursts, **FOR THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE CLIMBING-DOWN-WALL SCENE!** Instead of getting a high-point view of the Mini careening through the narrow streets, you see Jason & Marie flinching, the Mini's exhaust pipe blowing smoke, etc. all in quick half-second bursts, **FOR THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE CHASE!**That is how the action scenes in 'Supremacy' are shot. I couldn't see *one* kick or punch during the fight scene in the Berlin apartment. I couldn't see *one"" high-angle shot of what was happening during the car chase! Alright, there was a one-second high-angle shot of Kirill's SUV side swiping Jason's car, in the car chase. But that's it! The camera jerks around so constantly that you have *ZERO CLUE* about what's happening. I stood in line for an hour to buy the tickets for 'Supremacy' & this is the visual disaster I had to endure in every one of the action sequences.That doesn't mean there's nothing good about the movie. Matt Damon plays his part of the troubled assassin to perfection. We see his inner ordeal & his pain. The locales are drop-dead gorgeous & the remaining cast, in whatever little time they get, are very competent. I highly recommend the movie, but CLOSE YOUR EYES SHUT DURING THE ACTION SCENES. Let's hope that on the DVD, they will replace the ""Director's Commentary"" with a pre-editing version of all the action sequences.

The action is breathtaking though there are some cinematic choices (a lot of blurred footage) that are unusual and sometimes distracting. The shots of Russia are both beautiful and fascinating.

484,KenLG,"Great movie, just buy a steady-cam",9,27 July 2004,"Bourne Supremacy is a very entertaining movie. Granted, I'm partial to films set in Europe involving international espionage (or something to that effect). Matt Damon, as the anti-action hero action hero, performs well, as do the other principals, though the movie is definitely all Damon's. He does a great job making the character believable given the rage barely contained beneath the professional assassin's cold demeanor. The plot and action move along at a nice pace and the requisite no-escape situations that Bourne manages to get out of with skill and guile are always great to watch.I have to comment on the camera work. While I get what the director was trying to do, the action camera (in fight scenes and car chases at times) is way too amateurish. I can understand the desire to make you feel like you're some guy sitting in the passenger seat or in the same room as a fight and you're trying to keep up with the action but, please, let's try to keep the action visible in some form. All too often, directors seem to think shaking a camera around translates directly into a feeling of being there in the fight, making it more exciting. But, just like Michael Bay's little light reflector/camera swivel trick he likes to use, it does nothing to add to the tension of the chase or fight. Plenty of directors have put together beautiful action scenes with a fairly steady camera, fast edits and just plain good action. There's no need to make it impossible to truly follow the action by taking a camera and just flailing it all about. The car chase sequences seem to be better off only because the director/cameramen probably couldn't shake the camera as much going 80 miles an hour.This is definitely a fun movie to watch and enjoy. It helps a bit to have seen the first movie but just knowing that Bourne is a former CIA ""super"" agent that came out of a program called Treadstone is probably enough to get by in this movie. Oh, and be prepared for a nice prolonged car chase in Moscow that, once it finishes with a bang, makes you realize just how long you might have been holding your breath. :)",The Bourne Supremacy

And not just during the action sequences, more than once during face shots of Damon just standing there, the camera was shaking like the cinematographer had cerebral palsy. Most of the action shots were completely obscured. Now some will argue this is a technique to make you feel part of the action. This can be true when used sparingly but when the shot is moving so much you absolutely cannot see what is happening you just feel ripped off and annoyed.

486,superzaco,"Almost, but not quite....",7,7 September 2004,"I found myself really wanting to like this film - the first in the series ""The Bourne Identity"" was a fantastic effort, an 'intellectual' spy thriller. I also enjoyed the series of books which I read quite some time ago, so I am an established Bourne fan in either format and did come in with quite high expectations.The second installment in the Bourne series retains all of the core actors from the original which is usually a promising sign. Mat Damon is once again extremely effective in his role as the amnesia suffering, guilt wracked, reluctant super spy. My favourite scene from the movie is one he shares with Julia Stiles with Damon emanating malevolence throughout. His characters coldness is highlighted by repeated close ups of cold, threatening, ice blue eyes. Stiles also puts in an exceptional performance and I am looking forward to seeing more of that caliber from her- if only she could learn to choose better roles - not evidenced in her previous release ""The Prince and Me"".The supporting cast are also good - Brian Cox has made a living out of playing the older, wise CIA chief for a while now and is always enjoyable. Joan Allen as the agent in charge is strong and almost believable as a tough agent with a heart of gold. Franka Potente seemed a little lost in this film although I do believe that her part was tragically small, she normally has immense presence on screen. The film did start to lose me a little quite early though, with some major flaws in the internal logic of the plot. These not so little errors continued through the film and helped to take the edge off the film. One of the engrossing things about ""The Bourne Identity"" was its realism, something long missing from this genre. The Behaviour of Bourne in the first car crash of the movie (and there are a lot) was the first time that I groaned out loud. Why did he give up like that? Isn't he a driven man who will stop at nothing, especially where Marie is involved? Once the plot had started to unravel a little, I found myself nitpicking. Like the three or four agents watching cameras in all exit points in Berlin.Seriously, how many people exit Berlin every day?. Then they spotted their target, because the cloak he was wearing was dark. Again, seriously?? Not to mention the fact that the screen was in black and white! I know that these are small points, but the plot was riddled with them and it denigrated the authenticity of the entire film.The other major issue of the film which is generating a lot of criticism (and rightly so) is the camera work. A friend described it as ""NYPD Blue Syndrome"" where the hand held camera work is shaky to invoke frenetic activity. Unfortunately it is out of control here, creating nothing but confusion and motion sickness. I understand what the Director Paul Greengrass was trying to portray - throughout the novels Bourne is affected by moving lights such as driving at night but is simply too much here. Some of the action scenes are ruined by the camera work and I found myself giving up on trying to follow and resorted to simply waiting till they finished to see what happened.All that being said, I did enjoy this film. The franchise is not completely ruined (Cough *Matrix* cough) and overall it wasn't a complete waste, I just felt a little let down by the whole experience.",The Bourne Supremacy

Greengrass widely employed the technique of using a hand-held camera, which is often fantastic; however, it is absolutely distracting during the film's close-up fight sequences. In fact, it's often difficult to see what is actually happening.

Alas, after Supremacy's first ten minutes, any pretense at character development was abandoned, and we were treated to a pretty standard action flick. Lots of car chases, lots of heavy shooting, no character development, and a flimsy fluffy plot that tried to be sentimental but came off as merely gratuitous. The cinematography was very different from the first film. Supremacy was filmed in a grainy, jerky camera style. No doubt intended to be intense, it was merely distracting and made it very hard to follow the action when things got going. The plot was throwaway. You could drive a semi through the holes! Supposedly happily ensconsed with his wife, Bourne nevertheless has all his aliases and passports fully intact, with a cache of high-powered weapons magically at his disposal as he pops up in country after country, crossing international borders with surprising impunity.All in all, it was a fun diversion, but I was expecting a far better film, given the talented cast and history of the franchise.",The Bourne Supremacy

I can understand if this was done during action scenes because Damon isn't a professional Martial Artist(even though he did okay in Bourne Identity) and camera work that would add tension. But he did that for almost every scene. What was Greengrass smoking when he directed? There was also a scene that was sloppy, There was an extra standing near a kiosk waiting until Damon walks by and then ""action"". It seemed very out of place and the scene felt like an outtake. So Bad Directing Bad Cinematography And Bad EditingIf the Producers read this Please Fire Greengrass",The Bourne Supremacy
493,doug_gill42,Good Action mixed with great story!,8,25 July 2004,"WARNING! THERE MAY BE SPOILERS!The biggest problem I had with The Bourne Supremacy was the cinematography. Too much hand-held close-ups!! I found myself wondering what was going on during the car chases rather than sitting back and enjoying them. The good things about the movie are small but important. I like how Bourne's girlfriend dies at the beginning. When something like that happens in a movie, it really surprises me, plus it makes you more involved with the hero. I also like how the story developed throughout the whole movie. Some movies are boring, because you don't have to think about what the movies about. In this it's never boring, because you're always putting pieces of the story line together. (and it's not too difficult to do) One last thing that really stuck out to me was when Bourne said the F word. Some movies refrain from using this, but it made me believe his emotions in the movie. Words like frick, dang, etc. seem emotionless. Overall, The Bourne Supremacy was very good and a definite buy. Maybe the cinematography will be better on a smaller screen, who knows. So, go see this at the theaters (sit far back) and enjoy it! 8/10",The Bourne Supremacy

He will never become the stuff of lasting, enduring literature. ""The Bourne Supremacy"" (book) is overly long and overly boring. The movie version is better only because the book is so dull. I remember criticism of the ""Identity"" involving how rapidly the action/fight scenes flashed by so quickly that you couldn't tell what really happened. The ""Supremacy"" was even more jumbled...I have grown increasingly tired of the hand-held camera technique that substitutes for actually framing a scene so that the viewer can assimilate what happens. While the ""Identity"" was too fast for most viewers, the ""Supremacy"" was an unintelligible filmic stew. I don't care, so much, that the film didn't follow the book, since it was so dated and pedantic that it was a relief to finish at all. No fault of Matt D. or his capable fellow actors, the direction was atrocious and the cinematography amateurish in a less than appealing way.

It definitely would have gotten a perfect TEN if Franka Potente's character wouldn't have died so early in the movie. I thought that in the 'Bourne Identity' she really helped make the movie even greater; she matches the character, she mastered that role, she played it with wit. Franka Potente and Matt Damon are a very powerful couple on screen and I was a little sad to see her go so early on in the movie because i would have enjoyed seeing more of their on screen- electricity rule the movie theatre. Of course both movies, both stories are great, and with these awesome actors they were ...well, excellent! Thank you also to the people who cast Franka over any other 'hollywood starlet'.

After seeing the movie, I beg to differ.(Spoilers ahead) First of all, all Bond movies have the Bond girls. Jason Bourne's girl gets killed off in the first action scene of the film, and nobody takes her place. Julia Stiles played a small part, that was it.The thing I hated most was the shaky camera work. I can understand it in massive battle scenes like Omaha Beach in Saving Private Ryan but in here it could have been avoided, and was excessive. I fail to see why everyone is raving about the final car chase. It gave me a pretty big headache, that was it.Also, the characters don't make sense. When Jason Bourne told that one girl that he killed her parents, they didn't commit suicide, she didn't do anything. She just thanked him, and he left. If I had just realized that my parents loved each other after all and some guy had taken them away from me I wouldn't have thanked him. Also, when Pamela Landy tells Bourne his real name, a part of his old life, the thing he's desperately trying to find out about, he doesn't want to talk about or anything.Anyways, skip this flick unless you enjoy getting a headache from bad camera work.

Also, more light is shed on who was exactly Jason Bourne, so if you're curious to find out, the movie is not that bad of a watch.

501,njmorf,Ruined from the moment it started.,4,24 August 2004,"The Bourne Identity was a good enough film. Tense, exciting, absorbing idea and interesting concept.The Bourne Supremacy has half the plot, half the excitement and 10 times the cuts. During the quiet scenes the camera lurches like a drunkard on his way home on a Friday night. During the action the editor butchered the film stock with a shredder and glued it back together at random. No shot seems to last more than a few seconds and most last for a fraction of that. Even during the longer shots it's impossible to follow the action: the human eyes doesn't move fast enough to track the movement of a man running through a crowd - you just have to stare at the centre of the screen and hope that you can gather enough images peripherally to paste together the slightest understanding of the scened being played.The plot would have worked in a 45-minute episode of Alias. In a 100-minute film it would have held it's own except that you stop caring long before the end, exhausted from the effort of comprehending the visuals. Do yourself a favour: avoid.",The Bourne Supremacy
502,Kinsey C,Supremely nauseating,1,17 August 2004,"Brace yourself for motion sickness: there isn't one single static shot in this film, which would be all right if the nervous ""style"" served a purpose. Unfortunately, all is manages to accomplish is to make the viewer nauseous, a feeling compounded by the total lack of interest generated by both plot and characters. I love suspense and see nothing wrong with films whose sole ambition is to keep you on the edge of your seat, even if they wind up sacrificing realism in the process. But halfway through this one, I was rooting for the bad guys to kill Bourne and end this nightmarish experience.Perhaps it's the newest trend to shoot every insignificant scene of a film from five different angles and edit it as if you suffered from Parkinson's disease. Reducing each shot to a nanosecond of screen-time is an effective way to hide any mistake or continuity break, as well as script deficiencies: the viewer simply does not have the time to spot the mistake or try and make sense of what's actually happening in a scene, and just doesn't care because nothing makes sense anyway. Even the car chases are so chopped up that they are devoid of thrill or interest. I couldn't wait to get home and watch Ronin.The ""trendy"" director (and I use the term generously) of this supremely nauseating film really ought to revisit Hitchcock, whose approach was to figure out the ideal way to shoot a scene before getting on the set and to justify every camera movement. I doubt anyone will revisit the 2004 Bourne Supremacy unless they're masochistic.Last time I felt as physically ill while watching a movie was during Woody Allen's ""experimental"" movie Husbands and Wives, where the camera's movement was designed to make you experience the characters' discomfort. It effectively induced nausea in a primary way: the sort you shake off when you leave the theater, vowing never to see that film again. Not a brilliant strategy in this day and age of ""must own"" movies. But then on a TV monitor, I expect the Bourne Supremacy won't be as annoying. Size does matter. And you'll even be able to freeze every frame to see all that is missing.",The Bourne Supremacy
503,Schneb,Cinematography Ruined Great Plot,3,28 December 2004,"For those of us with Home Theater systems, Bourne Supremacy was more distraction than attraction. First, has Hollywood completely abandoned the use of the tripod and dolly altogether? Every single shot was hand-held with dizzying motion. It was so bad, that was all we were thinking about throughout the film. ""He's dialing a phone! Quick, move the camera to add tension!"" ""So why not have multiple fast zooms in and out with a big orchestral sting?"" (-4 for 90s TV camera-work) I had to check this problem on my computer to make sure my projector wasn't out of alignment. My computer confirmed that this entire movie is predominately green. Oliver Wood seems to had forgotten his Tiffen FL-D fluorescent filter on the initial shoot. Did he do the entire film in green to avoid this embarrassing miscue?(-2 for Star Trek I color lapse) The plot was excellent, but I thought the death of Franka was a typical Hollywood motivational formula worthy of a Simpsons spoof. If the motivation was to protect Franka, the movie would have been far better. (-1 for Mask of Zorro motivation) I am giving the movie a three rating for these glaring errors. Six points lost for cinematography alone.",The Bourne Supremacy

I never get motion sickness but I thought I might get it while watching this film. The fight scenes are filmed up close and with ""shakey cam"" as are all the action scenes. I can understand trying to add a sense of urgency or tension to a film but only once or 2x in a movie should ""shakey cam"" be used. Your brain can't process what is going on and the editing jumps every 5 seconds. The camera work is very distracting in an otherwise excellent movie.

Most of what I loved about the Bourne Identity was clearly gone: the sweet, sweet romance; the intricate fights; the self discovery. What remained was Jason's worst nightmare, unfortunately so blurred and chopped that I can only guess what really happened. That said, I'd pop a Dramamine and watch this again to try to figure it out.Matt Damon excelled in his role as before. I truly believed his motivation and supported his quest for revenge. I loved the music, the scenery, and the plot, so I give this movie an 8.

506,kilorilee,choppy chop-socky *minor spoilers*,6,18 February 2005,"The Bourne Supremacy is a flawed sequel compared to the Bourne Identity. The formerly baby-faced Matt Damon burned off his fatty cheeks for the first movie, but he still isn't convincing as a stone-faced, unfeeling killer. He pulls off the athletic moves well but seems a bit of a miscast, especially with the female balance from the first movie playing a lesser part. Listening to the director's commentary, intentions of portraying Bourne as a ""seeker of truth denied"" did not go so well either.The editing has got to be the worst part of the movie. Sure, the MTV-style edits are excellent and wholly complement the quick-draw, Kali-trained fists of Jason Bourne, but they absolutely do not work for CIA office politics. The talkie parts cut and swung back and forth like an undisciplined drunken ninja, from the steely Landy to the wily Abbot, giving each maybe three seconds (I counted) before cutting away again. Maybe it suggests chaos, competition and conflict, but it came across as amateur, as if a naked hairy circus strongman were to suddenly appear on frame, and they had to do a big CIA cover-up through editing. I did enjoy the exposition, but the camera-work just did not fit. Another plus is the fantastic European setting, although they cut away from the scenery and did not use it to its fullest.

507,ironfist360,a tough corner to write himself out of...,3,12 June 2006,"Granted, the book was taking place back in the 80s, but it seems (to me!) that a reworking of the story/setting and replacement of characters really did more harm than good. I don't mean to complain about the ""goodness"" of the film -- it was very well cast, filmed and presented -- but coming from my inner purist the adaptation of this movie seems to devalue the central idea of the Bourne saga. The book, The Bourne Supremacy, was the hinging point in Bourne's struggle. Here, his humanity starts to return and Marie was that conduit. It seems that Pamela Landy was the chosen role in the movie, and it was so much more impersonal -- she hands him a packet with his true identity in it, and in the same gesture, she gives him back his humanity... Where is Tony going to go with the next film? The book was about the struggles of Webb, Marie and their CHILDREN (!!) in finally ridding themselves of Carlos the Jackal's over-looming shadow and the mystery surrounding 'Jason Bourne'. I'm sure Webb will come to grips with his identity in the next film, but Marie and his children were what KEPT David Webb human while his alter-ego, Jason Bourne, threatened to undo all the progress that had been made.

(And if you're curious I give the bourne identity a 9.7) It is not your classic, cliché' ""James Bond with his izzy wizzy gadget"" (as paul greengrass would say) type of espionage thriller. Jason Bourne relies on brains and brawn. He's able to execute plans with imaculate and perfect timing.The fight sequences are gritty and well-choreographed. The score in this movie has to be one of the best I have ever heard, definitely in the top 5 list along with lord of the rings and the island. The song that plays while Jason bourne is running down the beach sends shivers down my spine it's so beautiful.I thought Paul Greengrass did a superb job with the directing. I love the ""shaky cam"". It completely imersis you into Jason bourne's world. The car chase in this movie is also one of the best I have ever seen.I must talk about the acting. The acting in this movie gets an A- from me. Everyone carries their roles well, Joan allen, Karl Urban, and Brian Cox shine. And even though her part is small, Franka Potente did a great job. I must admit that Julia Stiles deserves kudos for that scene where Jason has his gun to her head.. It's just absolutely electric.But the one who took center stage, the one that shone brighter than all of them was Matt Damon. His performance is not one of, but THE best I have ever seen, and I have seen hundreds, maybe thousands of movies. It's just amazing seeing what a great actor he is. He never lets up, and I think the scene that sold it for me was after he apologizes to the Neski girl and limps across the snow. You get a quick glance at his face as the camera pulls up to the sky, that soft music is playing.. and it's just bone chilling. He really shows how much Jason went thru and is going thru at the moment. I could go on for weeks about Matt's performance but I'll leave it at this: Because of his work in this movie and in the bourne identity, He is my #1 favorite actor right now.I thought the ending was great as well, it was a good idea to end the movie with that shot of Jason walking down the street and that nice techno music playing. When I saw the movie for the first time, I could stop quoting: ""It's easy--she's right beside you."" (you'll get the joke if you've seen it)Major kudos to tony gilroy for writing one kick-butt script and plot.If you have good eyes and don't mind a shaky camera (like I said.. I loved it but others hated it) definitely check it out, along with the first one.The Bourne Supremacy is in the #1 spot on my top 10 list right now.

As sort of a secret agent movie it has all the action you need, good car chases (though not as good as the first) and keeps you on the edge of your seat. It also has a gripping plot which twists here and there. Many of the questions that arised after the first installment are answered though some are left unanswered. What makes me give this a 10 is not all of this but how they develop Bourne's character over its course. Apart from his ingenuity and clever tactics (which we saw a lot in the first) there is a lot of personal development (Unlike other similar movies) The only bad points are the shaky camera (at times you're confused whats happening, specially during the action scenes) and its rewatchability (I like to see movies like this again and again) Definitely worth watching at least once. 9.5/10",The Bourne Supremacy

In the novels, the stabilizing presence of the novel's version of Marie is a nice bit of reality in the tortured world of Jason Bourne. I understand that they could not have made the movie anywhere near the actual book because of the difference of when the first movie and the second movie take place, but why give it the same title? All in all, going off of how they diverged from the Bourne Identity novel, this was a good sequel to the movie. I still wish they would learn how to buy a steady cam. The fight scene with the other leftover from Treadstone was so bad It was hard to tell what was going on. The chase was good.

To add insult to injury, at least half of the spoken words (in English, supposedly) were unintelligible and the plot was almost impossible to comprehend, except for the fact that this was an add-on to the previous movie and the CIA was out to kill Matt Damon, who had lost his memory (why? how?). I had seen the previous movie, but it didn't help my understanding much. This, to my way of thinking, is a genre movie that has outlived its value, if it ever had any. Most of the elements are gratuitous and do not contribute to the plot or character development (of which there is none.) I gave this movie the worst possible rating and consider it an utter waste of time. Incidentally, I love movies - good ones - and see quite a few.

517,jordonmcconnell,Hard to look past this film's weaknesses,6,27 December 2004,"For the record: I really liked the first Bourne film. It was refreshing to see that Hollywood could make a relatively serious spy/action film without the usual shallow glib humor, formulaic buddy frivolity and general cheese that almost every other post-Roger Moore-does-James Bond spy film seems to have. Consistent with Identity, Supremacy is serious. It's also stylistically similar and features many of the same actors.Unfortunately, the film really isn't that good at all. Because I wanted to like the film I found myself making excuses for it as I viewed it. But in the end I had to hold the film accountable for several significant flaws: 1 - The plot. The film picks up where Identity leaves off with Bourne traipsing around the globe with Marie. Luckily, Marie is killed off almost immediately after having the opportunity to utter some really bad dialogue. There is absolutely no resemblance, physical or otherwise, between this paper-thin character and the charming Marie of Identity. Marie's mercy-killer is a mercenary named Kirill who has been hired to frame Bourne for the murder of a couple of CIA guys then kill Bourne himself. Seems a reasonable enough premise for a spy film until it goes pretty much nowhere. What follows is a series of boring dot-commy office scenes - again featuring really bad dialogue - and some car chases. After all of the chaos is over I was left to wonder why Bourne had to be involved in any of this. Apparently, Bourne's old boss's boss, Ward Abbott (Brian Cox), wanted to erase evidence of his involvement in the murder of a reformist Russian politician some years earlier. So he hires Kirill to kill the CIA agents who possess the evidence, destroy the evidence and frame Bourne by leaving a conspicuous finger print at the scene. As it turns out, this fingerprint becomes the only lead in an otherwise perfect crime which leaves us to wonder . . . why? Why not just commit the perfect crime and leave it at that? Abbott's nemesis, Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) only becomes interested in Abbot when she learns that Bourne's fingerprint traces back to Treadstone. No fingerprint. No lead. No movie. Apparently most people can look past this but I can't. It's just dumb.2 - Character development. There basically is none. The movie assumes that you have seen Identity and therefore you understand what is going on in Bourne's mind. We witness Bourne having typical garbled and gravelly nightmare sequences and flashbacks so we know he's having some kind of disturbing recall. But the film never really delivers on an emotional level like Identity did. Damon does his best but the script just doesn't offer anything for him to work with. It plays out with about as much emotion as 'Colonel Mustard in the living room with the candlestick' as Bourne systematically pieces together snippets of his past. Ultimately he learns that he was the assassin used by Abbot to kill the reformist Russian politician. Whereas Identity offered the moving moment where Bourne can't go through with his contract in the presence of his mark's children Supremacy offers no compelling reason to explain why this particular assignment keeps resurfacing. As a result, when you witness Bourne's apology to his victims' daughter at the end of the film you are left to wonder why he would go through all of the trouble. (Especially after having labored through a relentlessly long but well-done car chase scene). The motivation just isn't there and either is the payoff.3 - The direction/editing. As noted by many others on this board, there is way too much jerky hand-held camera work here. There were scenes that felt like NYPD Blue at high-speed - the novelty long since worn off. Also, the editing was choppy and hard to follow - not like Mission Impossible levels of hard to follow - but difficult. I suspect that there are hours of film on the cutting room floor that would have been valuable in filling in some fairly noticeable leaps in the plot. For example, what exactly prompts Landy to visit Abbott in his hotel room after he murders Danny Zorn? Presumably there is some evidence that clearly points to Abbott but, unless I missed something, we don't know what it is. And, again, as with the initial Bourne fingerprint setup we have to ask why Abbott seems to intent on leaving incriminating evidence around? After all, which is more incriminating? Zorn's discovery that the fingerprint was planted? Or Zorn's lifeless body? Please. Also, why does Abbott kill Zorn and then blow his own brains out? Stupid.Ultimately, Supremacy is a reasonably well-done chase scene. Because it retains at least some of the good qualities of Identity it stands above the usual Hollywood fare but not by much.",The Bourne Supremacy

The plot was, well, mildly predictable, but that's not why you're there.However, a major drawback of the film was the, decidedly amateur-style camera work. I realize that a little shaking about adds chaos to the film and makes it ""edgy"" but, come on - I needed a Dramamine half-way through the film. They couldn't even keep the camera steady while he was reviewing the newspapers for heaven's sake. The director of this film should be forced to sit, eyes propped open ""Clockwork-Orange"" style, and watch this film over and over again until he pukes, so he knows to never again hire the film crew from the Blair Witch project. In short, an enjoyable film that you won't notice the negatives about provided you have palsy.",The Bourne Supremacy
519,dougclapp,Over the top and down the other side.....,7,1 February 2005,"It was hard to follow the story with the (I suppose) new technique of one second scenes throughout the entire movie. Did no one ever think to use a tripod? It would appear that in an effort to make the movie more exciting they shook the camera, made fast pans, out of focused shots with an abundance of scenes so dark the action was lost. The only long scenes were of inanimate objects or buildings with no connecting dialog. I am surprised that more people did not pan the director and editor. Action movies have improved over the years with the shorter shots to keep you glued to the screen. This movie however is a good example of too much of a good thing and becomes un-watchable, if not disturbing.I just hope this kind of garbage does not catch on. A movie should be entertaining, without making you nauseous.",The Bourne Supremacy
520,badtz_maru_rulz646,A sequel better than the first.,9,24 July 2004,"Sequels are known for not being as good as the original film, but from time to time we get an exception like for X2, Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (imo) and Spider-Man.I loved the original Bourne movie, loved practically everything about it except the fact plenty of things were changed from the book. After seeing that it finished #2 at the box office, behind Scooby Doo in 2001, I never thought there would be a sequel. When I first saw the trailer for Supremacy, I wasn't excepting anything, we don't get nice locations like in the first movie's trailer, no climax (the US embassy wall climbing was the first film's), so I really wasn't excepting anything.I bought the ""explosive extended edition"" and got a coupon for the movie, saw it the same night after rewatching the original film and LOVED IT. The Bourne Supremacy us everything the first movie is and better, it's got almost the whole cast back, except for Chris Cooper, however we get a little cameo from him. The story is good, a good and solid script apart for a few plot holes and big camera problems. Doug Liman had nice and clean fight/chase scenes in the first film, in this one we get horrible hand-held camera fight scenes and chases.Overall, this movie definitely fits in my top 5 of 2004 so far with Spartan and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and deserves a well earned 9/10.",The Bourne Supremacy
521,Hauz_20,Great flick,8,24 July 2004,"This movie was a worthy sequel to the first entry to what will probably become a trilogy. While the films are vastly different from the books they are based on, they have so far done an excellent job of recreating the main character and the events surrounding him. As far as political suspense films go, this is tops, at least in my book. If you haven't seen the first, definitely do so before seeing this film. Mat Damom does a great job playing a former amnesiac who has come to terms with his abilities as a top assassin. All surviving characters return to create an engrossing storyline that makes a film that not only builds on, but also seems to extend the events seen in the Bourne Identity.",The Bourne Supremacy
522,scdemandred,Shakycam ruins an otherwise good sequel,1,27 July 2004,"*spoilers within!*Director Paul Greengrass' name is strangely adequate for his treatment of the second installment in the story of Jason Bourne, amnesiac former member of a top secret assassination squad. The story is strong, the acting compelling, the twists and turns enjoyable, the fights and car-chases well-choreographed, and all of it is smothered under a nearly un-watchable, seizure-inducing directorial style.We first encounter Bourne awaking from a nightmare in his India hideaway - fragmentary memories of his old life are surfacing, driving him to write them in a grisly dream journal of half-remembered assassinations - and the camera is out of focus and shaking as though the subcontinent is experiencing an ongoing 9.5 temblor. I had hoped the shaking was only to show how disoriented Bourne was by his dream and would soon subside, but that was not to be.As the story unfolded, I found myself cringing at every new scene. An excellent fight scene between Bourne and the single surviving Treadstone agent is ruined by extreme close-ups and a sickening dollop of the ubiquitous shaky-cam - is that a knife? A rolled-up magazine? a hand? a foot? It's nearly impossible to tell. The climactic car-chase was similarly marred, and scans very poorly when one remembers how clear and well-presented the frantic Mini-chase in the first movie was.Greengrass' big-screen directorial debut seems like the effort of someone who is indeed green; the shaky style is amateurish and designed to create a sense of urgency at all times - even when one is not required. Greengrass (doubtless in an attempt to put his own stamp on the franchise) forgets the slick, classy style that made the first movie so much fun to watch. He needed to sit back and let the plot dictate urgency and tension, rather than trying to artificially induce those states of mind in the viewer. Hopefully the next installment will return to a more sensible visual presentation.",The Bourne Supremacy
523,Rep4Truth,Ruined by a gimmick,8,26 July 2004,"I really only have two complaints about the Bourne Supremacy - it was too short and the gimmick of the hand held, in and out of focus camera work was very disturbing and distracting. Let's face it, The Bourne Supremacy was never intended to win an Oscar, it it probably won't. But what it was designed to do was to entertain, and it does succeed, at times better than the original. Matt Damon returns and does a great job playing the 'every man' assassin. Matt is convincing in his physical portrayal as Bourne, Joan Allen is also good as the CIA manager, and Brian Cox is his usual swarmy self. The fight and chase scenes were well choreographed, but were lost in the camera work. By the time your mind and eyes had adjusted to the camera movement, much of the scene was over. Had they shot the sequel as they had the original, The Bourne Supremacy would have been a much better movie. Let's hope they get all of the bugs worked out when they do the third installment.",The Bourne Supremacy
524,spm-5,Bond is dead; Bourne is back...and he doesn't even know where he's been.,10,24 May 2005,"Personally I think this is a better film than Bourne Identity, even though I like both , this one has you nailed to your seat from start to finish. The script is credible , the camera work is very well handled. The action is even better than before...I could go on! The cast was well chosen; Joan Allen, Brian Cox et al, all do a great job. The scene between Jason and the Neski girl is a well acted piece, Matt Damon handled the emotional pitch perfectly. In the hands of a lesser actor it could have been ruined. The fight scenes are astonishing. The director strived to create the feeling of "" You are there"", and he pulled it off superbly. Even though it is violent it's not the pornography of violence we often see. If you haven't seen it, do so, ASAP. This is film making at it's best.",The Bourne Supremacy
525,rick_yune,Identifiably Supreme.,10,14 August 2004,"I had moderate hopes for this film. The first was stylish as hell but i thought dealt with the whole past issue superficially. This film is incredible - perfect structure (that sounds cynical but it has perfect climax on a climax - never too short or too long), superb acting from all round, and great direction, music, dialogue. While I'm a sceptic of constant hand-held etc Greengrass chooses it and sticks to it throughout - the film has its own style. The film shows Bond up for what is has become - kids stuff. It not only works because of the zeitgeist thing - anti-authority, etc. - but mainly because of the sheer intelligence of it, not just the plot but the little things, the idiosyncrasies, that Bond has lost - the hair on the door. Everything that Bourne does is done with measure and skill and it is highly plausible that he is the best of the best - better than Sam Fisher, and not simply the way I've been playing with him (im terrible at Splinter Cell, no ability whatsoever). To confirm: i cannot play Splinter Cell. But i reiterate this only to emphasise how spectacularly good this film is. 10/10. film of the year? very likely. ends with a decent line and a moby tune- what more could you possibly ask for not so simply from film, but from life.",The Bourne Supremacy
526,RippleEffect,They should have left BOURNE ALONE,5,23 July 2004,"There really was no need for a second movie, I even thought about this while getting my ticket to see this, SPOILERS AHEAD: most of this movie is talk, Marie has about 5 minutes of film time since she dies by a sniper in broad daylight in front of people, and the worst thing is Bourne Never uses his gun, he gets into 1 fight with a guy which can make it tricky at times to see who is fighting who since the camera work was so fast paced, this movie pretty much covers the Treadstone project from the first movie, and the CIA talk about it for half the movie, you can foreshadow every even that is coming, I really thought they tied ends up in the first movie, the director here is really reaching, if you are a Bourne fan think twice about seeing this.",The Bourne Supremacy
527,tedlutter,Not better that Identity!,7,27 July 2004,"I saw part two today, I was eagerly looking forward to it. I gotta say I was slightly disappointed.The story seemed solid and the acting by all involved was good as well. I found a large portion of the action to be too closeup with fast camera movement. I lost my sense of disbelief and started thinking about how much I couldn't see. I guess the director was hoping to put me ""in the action"" but for me the effect was the opposite.A lot of the action was similar to the first film in the fact that he's always on the run, but that's why I liked the story. Bourne is still clever and does many unexpected things.Overall, I'd say the move was good but I'd watch the first over the second and day. Hopefully, Ultimatum will return to the winning style Identity.",The Bourne Supremacy
528,loucoat,The Bourne Supremacy remains supreme.,10,22 May 2013,"From the start to the finish, this is one of the most intense films I have ever seen.Matt Damon's Bourne, happy in life running through the surf of a Goa beach with loving Marie to share it with him, is soon implicated in a black ops killing a world away in Berlin, and the killer is soon stalking them.Torn out of his paradise by Marie's murder, he comes back to find out who was responsible for that and his true background.Brian Cox is magnificent as the jaded, depressed, and doomed Treadstone operation coordinator who when cornered even turns on his loyal young, son-like assistant.The car chase scene in Moscow is like none I have ever seen. Even Bullitt can't compete.But it is the climax of the film, with Bourne's expression of remorse and apology to a young girl in Moscow, which sets the film on a pedestal above others ... and gives the viewer hope for mankind having the compassion necessary to have a future.Lou Coatney",The Bourne Supremacy

Just enough twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat, although it didn't produce the white knuckled suspense of a Hitchcock movie. But what movie does these days? Brilliantly acted, directed and filmed. Major glitch: the jump from Berlin (where it appeared to be summer) to Moscow (where it was definitely winter) 24 hours later. Minor glitch: how he knew to go to Berlin, but it didn't detract from the plot very much. The scene in Goa where Marie gets knocked off was kind of weak--a cheap chase scene which didn't add a lot to the story. The vaporetto chase scene in Venice in ""The Italian Job"" was a lot more creative. However, it's my kind of movie--I'm buying the DVD.

Now to be honest i expected this film to be twice as good as the first, maybe i was just a little optimistic. But id say it has to be a complete replica in standards to the other, plus the fact it has a great new story. So if you loved the first then you'll love this one just as much, the plot is fresh and new and yet again takes you around europe as jason bourne is chased. Its again another original story for a original idea. If anything it dosent do much more than the first but if you the kinda person who liked the second version of a game as much as the first well its kinda like that.

531,cds01,Don't waste your time....,3,7 August 2004,"The Bourne Identity was an excellent movie. Unfortunately, the sequel does not follow suit.This movie has (somehow) gotten overwhelmingly good reviews that I just cannot agree with. There are two main problems that just GLARED at me throughout the whole movie. The first, and most obvious, was a camera that NEVER stopped shaking. Some of you that claim to have depth as reviewers praise it as adding to the tension and suspense of the movie. Example:""Just like Bourne doesn't know what is going on, the audience doesn't know what is going on!!!""I didn't pay money to watch a blur on the screen. Maybe other reviewers were taking hallucinogens that made the blurs REALLY interesting.What's worse is the action isn't the only part plagued by shaking-camera syndrome - IT'S THE WHOLE MOVIE!!! What in the hell were the people that made this movie thinking?? This must have been what the board meeting looked like:""Okay, well we are going to be making a sequel to The Bourne Identity. I think we should make it more intense and hardcore than the original."" ""Well, we received praise on our camera manipulating technique from the first movie. It's edgy, it's witty; it's shaky-cam."" ""Okay I have an idea - we will use shaky-cam in this one too, but a lot more this time!"" ""So like in the action scenes?"" ""No, think bigger, action scenes and conversation scenes too!!! MUHAHAHAHA""""Yeah those idiots will really eat it up and give it good reviews!"" (evil laughter of boardroom) ""Best of all, we save on having to hire a choreographer for fight scenes, since no one will know what is going on anyways."" ""We can also do a chase scene in one take!"" ""We have some good ideas so far, but how do we make the movie more 'hardcore'?"" ""I saw a camera technique i really liked in the first Austin Powers. It was when Dr. Evil said 'ONE MILLION DOLLARS!' and the camera did a quick jerky zoom in. Now that's hardcore!"" ""NOW WE'RE TALKING!""Yeah, I have to comment on those jerky zoom-ins during conversations. I know they were trying to make it seem as if there was tension - or something... It was seriously lame. Okay.... the next problem is the casting of Landy. She is just not credible as a character. Not once did I think that she was the type of lady that would hold a position of that sort. When she acted, I saw acting instead of a character. I know those zoom-ins were supposed to make her look hard and like someone that gets to the bottom of things, but I just wanted to cry.The plot was a C- and the overall movie pulled down to an F by the directing. I know it is tough to make a sequel, but these guys didn't even try. Save this one as a rental. Maybe the shaky-cam won't give you such a headache when the screen isn't so big.",The Bourne Supremacy

People were actually covering their eyes in my theatre and two even got sick, although the second may have been a sympathy puker, I did not ask him. I have never written here before but the camera-work was so bad i really wanted to say something in hopes that it may even get back to Oliver or his operator/steadicam guy Klemens Becker.

533,eeveetza,action movie in every sense of this word,9,12 September 2004,"Have you already met Jason Bourne? If you haven't, you should do it. Go and see 'The Bourne Supremacy' and you will find out everything (or almost everything) about this former secret-service agent, formed to kill.'The Bourne Supremacy' is an action movie in every sense of this word. The music is full of rhythm and makes your adrenalin mount and rises the pleasure of watching the scenes of life and death chase in India, with fights and suspense in Berlin, and with car rushing along the streets of Moscow. Although the movie is long, it's very well thought of and as such keeps your attention during the whole time.Our hero (if we can call a professional murderer a hero) wants a normal life, but his past is too dark and he is too dangerous for some people, that they hunt him in his dreams and in the reality. So he is forced to discover the past and put all bits of pieces together. Doing so he is not making a mistake, ""they never make a mistake"".And as I loved the scene in the previous movie in which he is knocking down the two Swiss police officers that don't let him sleep on the bench, I loved the similar scene in this movie, only with an Italian carabinieri and an American consulate employee. Don't misunderstand me, I have nothing against the police, I just like the way he deals with people that stand on his way.",The Bourne Supremacy
534,gold_leader,Could have been better,7,1 January 2006,"I like the movie's story, plot twists, and everything else about the movie, EXCEPT the camera shots. The director used hand-held camera for lots of the shots to give it a sort of gritty documentary appearance, and what happens? You feel like your watching some 8 year-old swinging a camera around trying to get all the action in as little amounts of shots as possible. The first movie Bourne Identity was much better than this for that reason. However, if the camera work doesn't bother then you will like this one as much, if not possibly better, than the original. Jason has lots of new tricks in this movie and several plot twists insure to keep the viewer attention on him.",The Bourne Supremacy

Why it was so jarring? \ And the director broke about every rule in the book. Especially in the fight scenes where there really are no rules accept you have to know who is beating who up. And please Mr. Greengrass next film stay awayfrom the close ups and remember that you have to establish a shot or better yet a scene. This movie just goes to show that Hollywood still only puts out about 1 Goodaction film every year(If that). I hate to say but this is not it, the first movie ""Bourne Identity"" was 10x better. Hollywood please stop making this crap!!!!!This movie goes in the category of recent comic book movies like ""Daredevil"" or ""The Punisher."" I want my money back. One more thing to add Watch Dodgeball way more entertaining and a betterstory told so you can under stand it.",The Bourne Supremacy
536,mungerc,Awful Awful Awful,1,9 February 2005,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The camera was hand held and shot close throughout the entire movie. The resulting image was shaky and quite nauseating. Using all hand held shots works most of the time. When the shots are from one continuous viewpoint, and involve very few cuts, it can make you feel like you are part of the action. Not so in this movie.Since the camera was always so close to the subject, you could never quite tell what was happening. A gun fired! But who was holding it? As well as the notorious floorboards shot in the car chase scenes. I don't know why the director thought throwing in a shot of Matt Damon's feet on the floorboards multiple times was a good idea, but they are there. Jason pushed the accelerator! The editing was terrible. In the action scenes, no shot was longer than 3 frames. In the calm scenes, no shot was longer than 15 frames. Why? Maybe cutting that often would have been okay if the camera hadn't been so shaky, the frame wasn't always so tight, or maybe if the director wasn't constantly violating the 180 degree rule in order to add more confusion to an already confusing mess.The lighting was the worst I've seen in a long time. Simply because they didn't use any lights. I was praying for the nighttime scenes to end so I could see what was going on again. Of course, when I could see, I didn't want to because it made me want to puke from the camera shake.The story was okay. Standard action fare. The story followed too many characters around for me to really care about any of them. All I really wanted was to see (or at least hear) Jason Bourne to knock everybody unconscious.My advice is to see something else. Not some garbage that was obviously made by a high school amateur. How about James Bond?",The Bourne Supremacy

And just when everything is cool, they ruin it with a mega structure being blown up in slow motion (even the metal explode for some reason....).My point?Bourne Supremacy is a bit like the first part of a Bond movie.

I must admit that I haven't really got much to say about the film. The acting was fine,the plot so so, but it was exciting in places. Matt Damon,as always,shines, as does the formidable Mr Brian Cox.However, the disappointing thing about this film for me was all the different camera angles that appeared to flash past the screen very rapidly and, at times, I felt like reaching for the remote control to rewind to see what I'd missed:I mean this comment as no disrespect to the Director. I think that both Carl Lewis and Linford Christie would have been hard pressed to keep up with it.

540,lucy_sandwell,Truly Inspired And Original - A New Type Of Action Movie,10,24 November 2005,"I loved this film! It was much grittier than 'The Bourne Identity', but had the same quick pace. I found it heartbreaking to see him lose something that, especially if you've seen 'Identity', we became close to, as he did, and which kept him steady. Matt Damon is terrific as Jason Bourne conveying to the feelings and emotions of Bourne with brilliant control, a thing which many actors would have failed miserably at. Without another character close to him, there is no one for Matt to bounce off, therefore his conversation is rather limited to say the least. I was amazed at how he still kept you interested, and commanded every scene he was in, simply by his facial expressions and body language. Though I do enjoy his telephone conversations with Pamela Landy, and also Bourne and Nicky - played superbly by Julia Stiles - enjoy a fantastic scene together. You cannot, though, talk about a Bourne movie and not mention the fantastic action sequences - with Matt Damon incredibly doing all his own stunts - and the breath-taking car chases. I found the exquisite detail in this amazing and Bourne's ingenuity was at a level all it's own. The normality in which the film is set and the ordinary props Jason uses make you almost believe that it could, possibly, happen until you finish the film. I think that Matt using a rolled up magazine to fight with, and subsequently to destroy any evidence was fantastic, the doors not closing as he only just makes the train was so normal and so un-action movie-ish, in a world where the doors close just after every action hero, that I found it sensational - even though it sounds so ordinary and silly now. I truly believe 'The Bourne Supremacy' is an beautifully inspired film and that everyone should watch it.",The Bourne Supremacy

It's hard for any real movie fan to hate this movie. Matt Damon really pulls the line and Karl Urban makes the hit fantastic. This movie's a definitely a real blockbuster. And I loved the part with the cars crashing all over the tunnel, that was a good do in the movie. Do I recommend it - yes I do!

They are much too quick to follow so i don't think in a real fight you would know what happened, do you? the movie was excellent, much better than the latest bond movies.

543,tornari-1,Very well done,9,22 January 2007,"While I shy away from fiction because it never stirs anything in me because I know it's fake, I give this flick high marks. The way it's filmed and the minute amount of improbable if not impossible stunts give the movie a very real feel. I think the director of this film created a new level of filming, raising a new bar that I have not yet seen met. While much of the story line in this series sounds preposterously improbable the novel it is named after is even more far-fetched and I did read the trilogy by Ludlum. Aside from the vivid description that can conjure some great imagination, I have to say the story did nothing for me other than read it with such incredulity wondering who could even come up with something so far-fetched and improbable. I am extremely glad that the movies have strayed entirely from the story line. A novel is only as good as the probability of the story actually happening, and this movies series tries somewhat painstakingly to give that appearance.Watching a movie twice is usually not something I do since it bores me the second time around and increases the boredom level with each repetition. Real stories are the exception since there are always details and nuances about facts in the story I like to see captured and the first go-around doesn't always give me a chance to capture those details. This movie is so far the only exception to this. I believe I have watched it a total of five times thus far without it wearing thin on me. In fact I will certainly watch it at least a few more times.Incidentally this is the only movie I actually ever purchased.

There probably isn't a shot longer than 4 seconds in any of the fight or chase scenes, with the average shot being about a second and a half long... combine that with super-wobbly-camera, and you really can't even tell WTF is going on. It's so bad that it really detracts from the film. I remember being so pleasantly surprised by the first one.. by Damon, the direction, the writing... very smart & well presented flick.

545,Jennirec,Fantastic fast-paced mystery thriller!!,10,28 July 2004,"From the opening scene of a blurred, rain drenched night, seen through a car's windshield, Supremacy grasped my attention. As a huge fan of the first BI, I had no doubts of a superb follow-up. I felt the hand-held use of the camera captured the real emotion of Bourne's quick responses, despite being a bit queasy on the senses, (it helped to look off screen every now and then). This cinematography style served to create more mystery and gave the effect of 'less is more', especially when introducing the Russian assassin (Karl Urban!). This style is similar to some of the more scary X-Files. The plot is intriguing and the Damon's struggle against all odds creates a great protagonist. You are cheering for him and wondering how he is going to get out of his next predicament. The fate of Marie (Franka Potente) leaves doubts that may work well into a 3rd installment of the series. The pace, the action, the extreme car chase, the mystery and clues all weave together to create a spellbinding, entertaining movie. In fact, I couldn't believe when it ended as it had the feel of the LOTR's Two Towers, knowing that more great narrative is just around the corner. I can't wait to go see it again!! I highly recommend this film to action lovers!",The Bourne Supremacy

The plot was legitimate (within the context of the story) and Damon's persona was once again impressive.My only criticism is the big car chase through the tunnel. My guess is that the Lada taxi would probably have fallen apart after the first whack, and that the scene went on too long. The great thing about the first movie's car chase was that it was wild, but somehow realistic. They didn't need to get big and splashy - i.e. Hollywood - this time around.The locations were terrific and the editing was good. The build up of tension was such that I got nervous even when Bourne went into the bathroom just to wash up!All in all, I really enjoyed the ride and am hoping for at least one more.",The Bourne Supremacy
547,mattlmattlmattl,Good movie hurt by camera use and editing,7,23 July 2004,"The story is tight, the action almost non-stop and the acting adequate to the job. As we follow Bourne around the world chasing and being chased, there's almost never a dull moment.Unfortunately, Paul Greengrass (the director) seems to believe that not only should you shake the camera to generate excitement, but you should also cut very quickly all the time - I felt like he thought that if he could squeeze five cuts into one second, he'd win a prize.Often, I just tried to block out the visual noise while awaiting the outcome of a given action sequence when the shaking and cutting get really extreme. And there are a lot of action sequences.Too bad, really, because it took a movie that I would have given a ""9"" based on story and acting and dropped it to a ""7"". Anyone prone to motion-sickness from movies should beware.",The Bourne Supremacy
548,rj-swann,"If you like action movies but wish they were more realistic, you really should watch this movie.",9,30 April 2006,"A fantastic movie. It does for James Bond what Unbreakable does for Superman. Where the Bond movies focus on spectacular yet entirely unrealistic action sequences, the Bourne movies focus on Bourne, as they should. And Bourne is a super agent either, he's a normal human being who gets hurt and even cries. The action sequences aren't blown out of proportion, they're realistic and no bigger that they would be in real life.You might think that this would take away the thrill that can be had from action movie but it really doesn't. If anything, it enhances it. Once we know that Bourne is just a man, we really really feel like it's something when he does the things he does. He uses his brain and his abilities to solve problems, and when cornered he lashes out like a trapped animal. These are not the actions of a cool, calm action hero, but a man desperate to get out of the bad situation he has ended up in. The action sequences are close, intense and real. In other action films a car swerves to avoid another and you might be mildly intrigued, but in The Bourne Supremacy you feel like you're in the car, and if Bourne dies, you die.So there are definitely a lot of good things I could say about this movie, which is intelligent, exciting and engaging, and very few bad things (seriously, nothing comes to mind). Simply, this is one of the best films I've seen.",The Bourne Supremacy

Matt Damon is Excellent!!I love the Berlin foot-chase where Damon jumps the bridge and onto the boat.One thing I hated was the wavy camera. I think this movie really told about Jason Bourne more than the first one did. I didn't like how Marie gets shot and not kidnapped. I liked the character who took the place of Bournes old boss guy, Pam Andy.I liked how they do the thing where Bourne is watching them and says something that they look like or who's there with them like when he's looking for through the sniper scope and sees Julia Stiles and when he says ""Get some rest Pam you look tired.""

If you could bring back any assassin from the dead, or that is still alive from either of the first two Bourne movies, and use them as a 'main' character in the Ultimatum, then who would it be, and why.And, I think that it would quite be humorous if Director Paul Greengrass brought Agent John Nevins (Tim Griffin), from The Bourne Supremacy, back into the Ultimatum as a character.

552,cmei-1,Mechanics of Filming,7,1 September 2006,"I'd give this movie a 9+ for story. The shots are setup nicely. The wildly distracting element is the green push in the film and the very annoying 'NYPD Blue' style camera jostling, in parts. Really inconsistent filming. Some scenes - perfect. I've seen a number of films with the green/grain/'ekta'-chrome push. This film takes it to extreme. Shadows around the eyes, many areas are just plain green. I have a huge HD screen, and expected the upverted video to match a well done DVD, but that quality just wasn't there. Watches like VHS on a broken SD TV.The action scenes are very good - what distracts from them are the parts that include 1/4 second scene cuts, intentional camera shake - the scenes are already exciting, not being able to focus on anything in particular is just distracting. Extending the scenes 2+ minutes longer than needed is also hurts the film. I feel like a viewer on 10 grams of caffeine after a wild night out at the bars. Nauseous, nervous and ready to spit up - and not from excitement.The storyline is actually very good, except for some minor line flubs, the acting is consistent and good. The knife vs. rolled up paper fight scene is very well done. The last car chase - just awful.The Green push.. what's up with that? Very good film, with a few serious production flaws. Coulda been a 9 1/2. I'd buy a re-release w/o the production issues.",The Bourne Supremacy

James Bond will always set the spy thriller standard and has much more class than Jason Bourne.I read the three novels and wonder if the writers of the screen play had as well b/c the movies have only superficial similarities with the novels. Marie dies? She was his wife (and a forensic economist for the Canadien government (she from a Quebec in the novels, not Europe) in the three books and was as cunning (intellectually) as Jason! What happened to Carlos the Jackyl, Alexander Conklin, Mo Panov and Medusa? They threw out 99.5% of the plot from the novels! IMHO, read the Ludlum's novels and dump this steaming pile of Hollywood excrement!

I just wish he had capped the blond girl with the fat face (forgot her name). Oh, Julia Stiles! That would have made for an interesting third part. It was not as good as Bond (unless you are referring to the Roger Moore fake one) because he does not know who he really is for most of the movie and is trying to make restitution for his wrong doings.

After a few minutes I was wondering if I was watching the wrong film. At the end of the novel David Webb & Marie go to Hawaii, but the film, she drowns being shot at with Bourne & drives a car off a bridge into the river. After this, how could the film compare to the novel? The differences got wider until it barely resembled the novel. Instead of being in Hong Kong, Beijing etc the film is shown in European cities, most of the people in the novel were not in the film.Where is Sheng Chou Yang, McAllister, Wong, Staples, Mo Panov?

Each actor matched his or her character: Mat Damon turned out to be perfect for the role of Jason Bourne. While the part was very small, Oksana Akinshina conveyed her pain most believably. The action was non-stop and exciting, even though not all was completely believable. Lighting was perfect, dialog was exactly what was necessary for me to understand what was going on, and the direction was such that I couldn't wait for the next scene. And I cannot imagine a better ending. This was a thoroughly enjoyable movie that I saw in the theater, then purchased the DVD so I could watch it again.

Personally, I don't care much if a movie is like a book. I care whether or not the movie was good.That being said... I do find it entertaining how different Bourne Supremacy is from the book with the same name. LIKE I SAID, this is not to say that that fact detracts from the quality of the movie, I just think it's kind of funny.I mean, first of all, Bourne Identity was fairly different than the book. Fine. Bourne is kind of on the run at the end of the first movie, whereas he is in the care of the US gov. at the end of the first book. This means that the two sequels have totally different starting points.So, the movie starts off with Bourne in Asia iirc, whereas the book starts off with Bourne in the US. In the movie, Bourne's love gets killed, and basically the whole movie takes place in Europe (pretty much). In the book, Bourne's love does NOT get killed, and the whole book (pretty much) takes place in Asia. At the end of the movie, Bourne is in Europe, and kind of in limbo. At the end of the book, Bourne is back home happyish with the wife in the US. On good terms with the government. Movie Bourne is pretty much never on ""good terms"" with the gov.So, similarities between the movie and the book? There's some bad-ass named Bourne.As for the movie, I thought it was decentish. It was basically just an action figure-out-what's-going-on movie, with nothing extremely notable in my opinion. I liked Bourne ID FAR MORE than this movie. Bourne ID has the whole idea of not knowing who you are, etc. Which is an interesting and catching twist. Which, inherently (unless you were to have Bourne get amnesia AGAIN in the 2nd movie, which would be pretty lame) the 2nd movie can't have. Which makes it suck more. It's kind of like all the super-hero movies. You have the movie where they go from not being a super-hero, to realizing or developing their powers. That transformation/ realization about yourself is a very cool storyline. A storyline you inherently can't have in the sequel. Bourne is similar, and hence the sequel wasn't as good.The sequel is a fairly non-unique action movie.",The Bourne Supremacy

I am from Europe and enjoyed to be there again. Then I noticed some imperfections when it comes to the details. In first scenes, him running and his body sounds does not match the sound track at all. After some time it is disturbing especially when I did just listen to the movie without watching it. Next Mary died because of single shoot and then the jeep gets pooled from the water and back window still has glass. Impressive shooter :))) and perfect way of playing how to die. Really little things matter. Speed in the movie does not disturb me like others. It is the time that we live now - everything is happening rapidly. Those who do not follow - think they are getting old. Film is cool and I really loved the car chasing scene. Impressive driving skills and damaging nice cars. Well done.

I was 11 years old when this film released and watching this as an adult is extremely satisfying even though I've seen this many times as a teen. The action scenes feel real, authentic, you can feel every punch as well as the heat of each situation. This film made you invested on each character and there was a sense of danger.

This is after all, fiction.More Spoiler: Killing Franka Potente's character.... way too predictable and a good way to take some heart out of the story. Not imaginative. The B.

The fight scene between the last 2 agents of Treadstone was very disappointing because of the camera work. I know the idea was to try and put the viewer in the fight, but, in my opinion, it took any interest in watching the fight away. I didn't go to the movie to fight the agent myself. I went there to watch Bourne kick his butt. Contrast the first time you see Bourne fight in the first movie. The camera angle was far enough away you could see the quickness and ease with which he dispatched the 2 police officers. Instead of the same experience with this fight scene, the camera angle is in tight and is moving around so much, it's hard to tell who landed what punch when.I'm looking forward to ""The Watchmen"" but I hope the director doesn't try the same camera work.",The Bourne Supremacy

A major part of the beauty of the first movie (Bourne Identity) is that the viewer was able to actually see Bourne's fighting skills. The camera work used by director Greengrass made it extremely hard to appreciate the main character's training as an assassin. The camera always seemed to be jostling around, as if the cameraman was having a seizure. The closeup work during the internet café scene was especially annoying. Were we supposed to be snooping as we looked at the screen over Bourne's shoulder? The character never would have tolerated someone that close. Online research can be pretty dull, so was this simply an attempt by Greengrass to liven up this scene? Hopefully Greengrass won't duplicate this sloppy, nauseating camera work in the next movie ""The Bourne Ultimatum.""

565,Keyser_Soze03,All hype and no substance *Spoilers*,3,28 July 2004,"I'm sorry, I really don't see why everyone loves this movie. Even aside from all the terrible, jumpy camera work, there is absolutely no form of a plot at all. And I'm not just some movie-basher who only criticizes the movies I see--I like most movies and really loved the Bourne books--but this was just too much for me. Nothing that happens throughout the film has very much meaning, it was all essentially just a bunch of loosely interconnected ideas that allowed a continuation from fight scene to car chase.First off, why did the Russians try to kill Bourne in the beginning of the movie? Do we ever find that out? It obviously had something to do with the Russians connection with David Abbot, but even that connection was hardly explained or touched on before Abbot blew his head off. And then when Marie was shot underwater, what was with that strange scene of underwater-CPR, followed by Bourne staring at her as he lets her drift away. Very bizarre. He also didn't seem too sad that she was gone after the fact, either. Other plot problems/weirdness were the Neski deal (I know it was his first assignment, but it was just so randomly touched on) and going to the Neski daughter (such a random scene...he goes there, tells her he killed her parents, makes her cry, then leaves...I guess you could say he was trying to make amends but the way it was shot was just odd), somehow going to that other assassins house for no really good reason, and when Bourne was getting chased at the end, how did they always know where he was?....all in all there wasn't much of a storyline, only fragments.There are other problems, such as why Bourne is so easy for the CIA/other cops to find when he is supposedly a well trained assassin who can slip into and out of places unnoticed at will? He used his own passport twice at first, even when he knew people were looking for him. I mean, come on, the Jason Bourne in the books would never have let that happen, he was a chameleon. He never changed clothes in the movie either. I know they didn't follow the plot of the books, but they could have stuck with the character a LITTLE bit, ya know? Anyways, I was disappointed to say the least. Seems like everyone else liked it, but I know this movie could have been sooooo much better had the writers stuck with the book story lines, at least to a degree. The Bourne Supremacy movie does not follow the book at all. All I can hope for is that many years down the road someone decides to remake these movies and do more justice to the books. 3 stars out of 10.",The Bourne Supremacy

The action/fight sequences are enjoyable and Brain Cox is as reliable as ever.My main problem with the film, however, was the terrible underlying story (a very flimsy premise), the excessive use of documentary camera-work (i.e. shaky and nausea-inducing), the constant cutaways in a vain attempt to create tension and one of the dullest car chases ever in a recent movie.The first film leaves me with enough goodwill to want to see another Bourne installment, but not if it's with the same director.",The Bourne Supremacy

The camera itself is not mounted on any kind of a base, and it shakes and shivers all over the place. To add to the whole mess, the cameraman pans in ad out incessantly, making the viewer almost dizzy. Whoever edited the film adds blurry scenes. I recommend the director and producer go back to the beginning of film, and take a look at the great films. All that camera involvement is just not necessary, and takes away from the movie.

Even though it is of course a bit different from the book the more important things are covered. Everything unfolds in a rapid way, at first leaving you with a few questions unanswered. But the longer the story goes those gaps are filled and it's just done in a really spectacular way. If you're new to the Bourne series, you'd better start with the first one, because they are of course all linked together. The endings in both movies and books leaves you without a clue of what will happen next, which is also common between the scenes. I also like how it stands out from the usual type of productions.

570,fultzkm,A flawlessly executed modern day spy thriller,9,27 April 2009,"It is easy to get lost in this complicated sequel's plot. Luckily, there are plenty of fights and car chases to keep one's attention. Jason Bourne is no longer worried about who he was and is now concerned with what he can do to make a good future for himself. He is very cautious, observant, and suspicious of anyone who may look out of place while slowly piecing together his past. We learn about the incident in Berlin, who was running Treadstone, and why Jason is still being hunted. Filled with deception, betrayal and great action scenes, The Bourne Supremacy is a superb spy thriller.The past between Pam Landy (Joan Allen) and Ward Abbot (Brian Cox) is about as vague as some of Bourne's memories but their relationship shows the CIA's sense of urgency and competition in the search for Bourne. One of the two is trying to hide the past while the other is trying to find the truth.Karl Urban plays Kirill, a Russian secret service agent and assassin hired by one of Abbot's corrupt business partners from the past. Kirill is portrayed as a perfect Bourne counterpart (think of Grant in From Russia With Love.) The Bourne Supremacy starts to form the new identity of Jason Bourne. He wants to start making up for the past he is slowly learning about. Bourne is feeling so much emotion that he apologizes to the daughter of a past target. The movie ends with Jason in New York and nicely sets up for the third installment. This leaves the viewers curious as to why he is in New York because ""He doesn't make mistakes. He doesn't do random.""",The Bourne Supremacy

That being said, the storyline was appropriate and the action first rate (when you could tell what was going on between the camera shots bouncing or moving constantly). The final car chase was a bit overdone and slightly ridiculous, but overall the movie was okay. I wonder if the director actually sat down and watched the finished product on a big screen when he was finished, though.

Featuring sloppy camera tricks to portray action, stretches for dialog to fill scenes and drama which hardly measured to the original. Action scenes were stretching the imagination a bit (but they were good). The car chases were a bit better than the first but the whole, ""I can see you through the window from across the street"" was a little played out.I would recommend waiting for the DVD.

I prefer to see the skill involved and be excited by that, rather than being taken along for a thrill ride. It's just not as effective for me.But, other than that, a very cool movie.

It was an intelligent blend of suspense, action and romance. What especially worked, gave dimension to the movie and rendered the main characters endearing was the relationship between Bourne and Marie. As in the Ludlum's novel, Marie comes across as the main ingredient of the Bourne character: without her, Bourne is lost. He can't be anything but a highly trained killing machine devoid of any real sentiments.However, the sequel, 'The Bourne Supremacy' is a fiasco all the way, barely worth 4 out of 10. It has absolutely nothing to do with the Ludlum novel (except the name, of course). Killing Marie right at the beginning of the movie was one really dumb mistake. Bourne and Marie WORKED. Bourne and Mary were ENDEARING. Killing what would have been one of the movie most interesting ingredient (and maybe its only redeeming element- the Bourne-Marie relationship) right at the outset is beyond me. The rest of the flick is nothing but a Van Damme, Steven-Seagal-type affair, a no-storyline succession of action sequences sure to please the high-testosterone, pea-brained crowd.

I can appreciate the notion of creating urgency, confusion, and intensity with such camera techniques, but felt it to be a major detriment to the film as it was employed. Rather than generating tension and then providing periodic release, the director went with tension throughout. I saw it on a large screen, close to the front, and found myself closing my eyes through parts of the movie to minimize the dizziness and nausea that set in about fifteen minutes in.

I much preferred the 'original' Bourne.That said, if one has not read the books, or just forgets about them and just thinks of this as a different character - Bourne II? - then the movie is well done and enjoyable. Do they plan any more of the Bourne series?",The Bourne Supremacy
577,robert-giffords,More of the same ...,9,21 July 2004,"... which isn't a bad thing if you liked the first one (which I did).The outline is different, but the core of the movie is the same -- lone agent off the reservation kicks butt and takes names. Damon does a fine job in the role. As noted by other reviewers, the plot doesn't really come together until the end, but it does come together.Like the first, there is one big hand-to-hand fight scene, an explosion or two, big car chase (this time through Moscow, not Paris), etc. Unlike at least one other reviewer, I really liked the jittery camera -- it made things seem edgier and tense, which was appropriate. I believe much (most?) of the movie was shot with hand-held cameras.Anyhow, I definitely recommend it -- it won't win any Oscars for screenplay, acting, etc., but is solid entertainment, which is what most are looking for from a summer movie.",The Bourne Supremacy
578,gravfire,Excellent movie with a disappointing touch...,7,13 February 2005,"I was torn while watching Bourne Supremacy. I'll just go ahead and say this before I mislead. I loved this movie! Unfortunately one key aspect just about dragged this film under the water. The camera was far too unstable. It was obviously done intentionally by design choice, but it was excessively overdone. Through action scenes that had you at the edge of your seat, you'd just come to realize that you were only trying to see what the heck was going on. This made these scenes a little hard to enjoy. But not only was it the action scenes; even during quiet still scenes the camera would always seem to be moving, and eventually was giving me a headache. Just to serve as a warning, it's pretty much like that throughout most of the movie, so brace yourself for an adventure of epileptic proportions.-- However -- The acting was close to brilliant in my opinion. I don't think the casting for Jason Bourne gets any better than Matt Damon because he fits the part perfectly. The rest of the cast all pretty much played their parts well, so I am pleased to announce that there aren't any exceptionally bad actors or actresses. In addition of the immersive storyline, it created a much enjoyable film. For a sequel, this actually surprised me because I enjoyed this movie as much as I did the first. If you're into action flicks, this definitely will not bore you. If you liked the first movie, then you'll most likely be very pleased with the conclusion.",The Bourne Supremacy
579,Geetarchik,This is how sequels are made.,8,28 October 2011,"This film was surprisingly satisfying for a sequel, in fact it could probably stand alone, as there is plenty of background provided throughout the film. Although the plot line is a little cliché (ex-spy tries to settle down with girl, spy's old boss kills girl, ex-spy seeks revenge), the way Bourne is depicted is surprisingly realistic, which is in keeping with the original film, Bourne Identity. He doesn't manage to keep it together the way characters such as his often do. He is shown throughout the film as unstable, which gives us continuity from the previous film, and allows us to relate to him more than characters like James Bond, for example. Compared to the regular action man, Bourne is innocence one minute, murder the next, a deeply flawed, guilt-tripped, nervous wreck with a smooth finish, making him both identifiable and undefinable with his complexity. The other characters in the film are also well portrayed, Nicky reacts perfectly to encountering a human killing machine, Pamela Landy is both tough and vulnerable when dealing with Bourne, Krill, the Russian assassin, is cold and calculating to the end, and Ward Abbott's eventual suicide was surprising yet appropriate for the classic good-guy-turns-out-to-be-bad villain.",The Bourne Supremacy
580,bonescro,This ain't no Ronin (SPOILERS),6,4 August 2004,"Very good movie.The only real problem that I had with it is that they should've given the cameraman a BAL test beforehand. The way the camera was shaking and jittering was EXTREMELY annoying. I'm not the only one who noticed it either. For that matter, I gave it three points less than I would've had they not tried to be cute with the shots. Blame the director for this. I will avoid his future movies.I gave it a 6.Points off for :3 - lame camera work. Maybe I ain't hip no mo. .8 - The oh-so-predictable way that they offed his girlfriend. Anybody who did not see that one coming from a mile away needs to come play the shell game with me. I also thought that it was pretty neat that no one else noticed that there was no logical reason for changing seats. It was his training, telling him that the driver was the target. duh. .2 - kinda cheesy car chase. I know that some of you liked it, and, to some extent, I did, too, but it was a Ronin ripoff. And not a good ripoff, either. Long live John Frankenheimer.",The Bourne Supremacy
581,jjmimester,It was good!,10,29 July 2004,"The Bourne Supremacy was well done, and well acted, with special note to Matt Damon. For a film of this genre, I think it was VERY well put together. The camera seems to be jumpy, almost as if it was done hand held. Usually this would bother me, but in this instance I actually enjoyed it, and thought it fitting to the story. The ending car chase scene in Russia must be one of the best in it's class, with heart thumping action and speed. It was my favorite part of the movie. Damon proves that he is capable of great emotion, even in a rather stony faced character, and the ending scene in which he is talking to Neski's daughter almost had me in tears. A worthy companion to it's predecessor, The Bourne Supremacy gets full marks for me!",The Bourne Supremacy
582,faun-1,An altogether great movie,9,13 October 2004,"When you take the three genres, action thriller and drama and mix them all together, you are at the risk of making some mess! What the Bourne team has created is nothing less than awesome! If you like wild car chases, then this is a movie for you. If you like a move that says it all - then this is a movie for you. If you like twists, then this are a movie for you. If you just like to sit back and enjoy a great movie, then this i s the movie for you!The chase that never ends for the retired agent, James Bourne, still goes strong in a movie that memorizes you and holds you frozen to the screen. James Bourne still hasn't lost his touch and moves. He makes great use of them, and almost super like tears down his opponents. Of course he also outwits them, but with twist that will boggle your mind, it is an altogether great movie in its genre!",The Bourne Supremacy

This movie certainly deserved it. It is a sequel that does its predecessor proud. I would be very surprised if Matt Damon didn't get an Oscar nomination. This was not just another action movie. It had just the right blend of suspense and action. There was a car chase that rivaled The French Connection. I found myself clutching the armrests in quite a few scenes. A guaranteed most enjoyable experience. The only thing I would suggest is that if you have not yet seen the first movie, The Bourne Identity, do see it first. That will set you up to have all the pieces tied together. I will definitely add both movies to my collection.",The Bourne Supremacy
584,meringham,"Stellar work, all around",10,26 July 2004,"I won't bore anyone w/ plot specifics - those are easy enough to find. From a critical perspective, just about everything in this film is top notch. Matt Damon continues his good work from the first film with a restrained but well defined performance as a man skirting the edges of his humanity. The plot forces his character to draw from both his background as a killing machine and his budding life as a (somewhat) everyday Joe. While the former clearly takes precedence, the latter drives Jason Bourne's decisions - and gives the film its emotional core.Joan Allen and Brian Cox do a great job in their strong supporting roles, playing a sort of yin/yang of modern vs. old school CIA. Effective in smaller roles are Franka Potente, Julia Stiles and Karl Urban, who plays Bourne's Soviet superagent equal. The writing is effective - everything is quick and to the point - no wasted air here. As for technical work - the stunts could not have been better. The film culminates in one of the best chase scenes put to film. The photography is gritty, helped certainly by the harsh whites of the overcast sky throughout the Europe depicted in the film. The direction seems to have received a lot of space in reviews. I think Paul Greengrass has a fantastic idea in trying to engage the audience through Jason Bourne's eyes. It's an absolutely visceral experience, and while Greengrass does go a bit overboard with the camera movement and editing, the pace of the film is resultantly so frenetic that one almost leaves the film breathless. Many people will have a difficult time with the style - I applaud the effort and while a few more establishing shots would've been nice, I think the general effect was successful. Go in warned, however - this is not one to experience from the first 5 rows.While The Bourne Identity had a freshness and gee whiz quality to it, this second installment takes a darker, more brutal path. This film doesn't have a lot of underlying happiness. Still, what emotion it does contain is well placed. All around, a very satisfying thriller. Kudos to the filmmakers for pulling off what I believe is a better 2nd chapter in the Bourne trilogy.",The Bourne Supremacy
585,neptunejmax,Justifications for shaky camera-work,2,6 August 2004,"Some people liked the shaky camera-work. Fine. You're entitled toyour opinion. However, don't justify your preference with thefollowing reasons:1. The shaky camera was reflective of Bourne's state of mind.If the above is true, why was this technique used for EVERYsequence; even the scenes that he wasn't in and had nothing todo with?2. The technique is innovative and artistic.Sorry, but this shaky camera technique has been in commonusage for television and movies ever since those Levi'scommercials started the trend twenty years ago. The artful trick to itis to use it appropriately.3. This gives and exciting ""hand held"" effect.This is not a hand held technique. Hand held means that thecamera operator is not using a tripod, but is trying to shoot thesubject matter. This is like what you might see on an action newsreport, or in a documentary where there wasn't time or roomenough for a steady shot. What you have in Bourne Supremacy isa style called ""drunk-o-vision."" This means that the cameraoperator is intentionally trying NOT to shoot the subject matter, butrather to wave the camera around drunkenly, or as if someonestrapped the camera to a dog's head. Again, there are times whenthis can be used for good effect. In this case, it was used withoutany kind of discrimination or artistic talent, presumably to keeppeople with ADD from getting bored. 4. It made the action sequences more exciting.About half the people in the audience when I saw it were talkingloudly about how they couldn't even tell what was going on in theaction sequences. How is this exciting?The very fact that so many people are talking about thecamera-work -- pro or con -- shows that it was noticeable, and adistraction from the story.",The Bourne Supremacy
586,cgbailey,one helluva ride!,10,24 July 2004,"The major movie reviewers of our time aren't lying to you. It's one more rare example of a film sequel that is better than the first. Once the film starts, the action gets underway within minutes, and is virtually non-stop. I can't recall a better, more exciting car chase in any motion picture since 'The French Connection' in the early 70's. It truly looked--and felt--like a tornado in a tunnel. It was absolutely incredible. The question is--can a third Bourne film be just as good, if not better. And yes, there will be a 'Bourne 3', and it will be a daunting task to keep up the pedigree this likely film franchise is building. Rent 'The Bourne Identity' first if you haven't seen it, then go see 'The Bourne Supremacy'. Seat belts, anyone??",The Bourne Supremacy

I also read some of the reviews before going to the movie and thought it would be hard to follow, I had no problem, and usually if there is more then one story to follow I get lost, I like to be entertained!All and All it was a great movie, worth the money and I'm glad we saw it in the theatre!",The Bourne Supremacy

Don't get me wrong the Director from the first Bourne movie had a very Indy background and I like Indy but this movie will suffer because of the shakey shooting style. The fight scene in the apartment looked like they let Mat shoot the scene while he was fighting, the shot was so tight most of the time it was distracting.In my opinion the camera is supposed to be transparent to the film not apparent to it.

I have read the entire series and give the movie a resounding D and only that high because it was slightly entertaining once I got over the sick feeling in the pit of my stomach from being deceived into thinking this was based upon the novel. I understand that Hollywood will take liberties in writing a screenplay, but they should at least read the book they are ""adapting"".

It's a nice movie, lots of action (though a little too much camera motion for my taste), but for someone who read the book (and it WAS a best seller, so that means a fair number of people should have read it) and liked it, the movie should be a great disappointment. The book had so many twists and turns, the movie has maybe one. The book was set in Asia, Marie is kidnapped not dead (thus changing Jason's motivation), and the movie's ending is unsatisfactory. In short, the movie trailer should say ""based on a character created by Robert Ludlum"", rather than ""based on the novel by Robert Ludlum"" - that would be more honest.",The Bourne Supremacy
593,JoeTheCritic,Amateur Film night,5,23 July 2004,"The Bourne Supremacy is an excellent example of how every element is needed to make a good action movie. The writing, acting and directing must all come together in a special harmony. A rare occurrence. Something this movie's predecessor achieved but this film sorely misses.Matt Damon does his usual effective job combing the fragility of his lost memories with the cunning and skill of one of the most deadly assassins. The rest of the cast deserve high marks as well, especially Joan Allen. The plot is well thought out if somewhat predictable. The dialogue and staging is neither insulting nor unnecessarily complex.The problem is the filming and, boy, is this a big problem. In fact it makes the movie almost un-watchable. As others have mentioned the hand held 'jiggly' cam-corder filming severely distracts from the picture. This filming style, combined with extreme close-ups of everything from actors to the cars leaves the audience feeling nauseous. The big chase scene was so bad I actually had to get up and leave for a trip to the men's room.This movie should have been great but the director's choice of frenetic pacing and blurry and dark camera shots leave nothing but disappointment for me.I know there will be a 3rd Bourne movie maybe even a fourth or fifth. It could be the next James Bond (Wasn't that supposed to be Vin Disel?) I just hope they send Paul Greengrass back to MTV and find a different director. Watching a two hour flick-flick video just wasn't for me.If you must go to this movie sit as far back as you can and at least you won't leave with a headache.

The rest of the time, I simply closed my eyes. If I had been alone, I would have left after 10 minutes. I HATE the kind of camera-work used in this movie. A pretty good movie was destroyed by intentionally abusing the eyes of the moviegoers.I would have enjoyed this movie, if it hadn't given me a headache. The acting was good, and Matt Damon's intensity was on target and contagious.

To get an idea of the ""trendy"" effect I am talking about. Imagine trying to film a foot chase scene, and to keep up with the action you have the camera man running too. I would guess some percentage approaching half of the film was filmed in this manner. The effect actually made me a little sick to my stomach from all the shaking. I had two choices for films to see, The Bourne Supremacy or Catwoman. So I looked at ratings on IMDb of course. 8+ for Bourne, Less than 3 for Catwoman.

This was probably one of the easiest scripts that any of these actorshave ever had to learn, given the lack of dialog. The characters move from city to city and scene to scene with little or no motivation or explanation. Villains come and go, each one vanquished after a long, hard to follow chase or fight scene.

601,Michael_Brochstein,Very good but not as good as The Bourne Identity,8,26 July 2004,"Overall very good but a few minor flaws. One in particular was the way that the hand to hand combat scenes are shot - much too close up. In The Bourne Identity, the audience can see Bourne's martial arts techniques and in this film you are given the sense of his limbs moving quickly and the opponents are responding (or not) but we have to take it on faith that Bourne's moves are convincing and effective. In the first Bourne film we can see it for ourselves and if you didn't see the first one you might not. Since we know that Matt Damon can do the moves then why not show them to us (with a wider shot).Conclusions: 1. This film is very entertaining but you must see The Bourne Identity before seeing this one to fully appreciate this one. 2. Bring back Doug Liman as director (I liked his pacing better, you can better see Bourne's logistical mechanics and it is less simply bang-bang-chase-chase).3.

Is this because the fight-scene choreography is below par? There were what could have been some great fight scenes in this movie, if you could see them!! There were also come good foot chases, and car chases, but without being able to see anything besides camera shake, it really wasn't very good.

Very loosely based on the novel of the same name by Robert Ludlum, The Bourne Supremacy skips much of the source material to deliver a trim and well-paced spy thriller. Since there is a third book, one might reasonably expect to see Matt Damon starring in The Bourne Ultimatum before long.If anyone here has read the excellent Ludlum novels, you might be disappointed to find that many aspects of the character of Jason Bourne are completely absent from the movies. Still they both work in their own right as action films. My only real complaint with the movie is the shaky camera that others have mentioned. It really does make some of the action scenes totally incoherent. What ever happened to actually choreographing a fight or a chase scene?As a side note, given the amount of screen time she gets, on wonders why Julia Stiles even signed on for this trilogy.",The Bourne Supremacy
607,antipode-2,This is a TERRIBLE movie,1,31 July 2004,"I liked the Bourne Identity and was expecting an equally good follow-on with the Bourne Supremacy. This movie was so poorly done I don't know where to start. The sound mixing was horrible. In many scenes it was impossible to tell what the actors were saying due to background noise and music in the same scene (Actually this is a fairly common problem as the younger generation hasn't learned that not everyone goes to movie just to hear the music). Speaking of music, this movie's score was useless and very tiring and way too repetitious. The cinematography was terrible too. If you like jittery photography that never stops and gives you the feeling you've just acquired a bad case of A.D.D., then this is your movie. The attempt at imparting urgency and excitement in an action scene was sophomoric, and I'm sure most undergraduate film students could do better with an 8mm Kodak movie camera on their first try. Overall this movie is a useless attempt at a sequel and you should save your money.",The Bourne Supremacy
608,pavanza1,They should have left the camera alone!,3,1 August 2004,"What a disappointment! I know people who are true fans of the first film that actually got sick from the hand held camera work during the action sequences. I have the Bourne Identity DVD and Doug Liman's direction is way beyond what Paul Greengrass did with this film, Tony Gilroy's screenplay once again was strong but I am just amazed by the choice of Paul Greengrass for a film franchise that had some solid potential. The chase sequences had great timing but once again I must comment on that moving camera! Weren't there test screenings? Didn't they hear any comments on this?Karl Urban and Marton Csokas make excellent bad guys! If you are a true fan of Ludlum's character there might be enough cool stuff in this film to keep you entertained, it's just that you will be angered by the ever moving camera that will disorient you every time the action gets good and you start to ""like"" the film. That kind of camera work looks great for music videos but not for a feature length film. Mr. Greengrass needs to take a look at a what a steady cam can do.",The Bourne Supremacy
609,saxet_wercs,Too-fast action kills the new-Bourne,4,5 August 2004,"The Bourne Supremacy shares much with its predecessor, The Bourne Identity, including a great cast, solid plot, and interesting locations. A very refreshing touch to the latest installment in the Jason Bourne series based off the bestselling books by Robert Ludlum, is that all of the important cast were recast in this movie. Another nicety found in the previous film and continued in this one are the foreign locations visited including Berlin, India, and Moscow, this adds the tremendous feeling of culture and realism lost in the newer James Bond films. Unfortunately, all the efforts to recapture the smooth intensity and panache of the original Bourne flick comes to naught simply because of horrible directing and cinematography on the part of director Paul Greengrass. Without fail, all of the exciting parts including fight-scenes, running from assassins and police, and long, involving car chases (most notably one in Moscow) are ruined by too-close camera angles, wild-zooming, and poor editing. In a business full of sequels good and bad, The Bourne Supremacy fits squarely into the latter, bad. The film-makers got the best ingredients to make an awesome continuation, unfortunately, they chose the wrong director and killed this exciting new-Bourne brother.",The Bourne Supremacy

However, about thirty seconds into this movie I started to get queasy, and it wasn't the popcorn. The movement of the camera was making me feel motion sickness! It ruined the whole movie for me (and my wife) as we tried (in vain) to enjoy the movie despite the camera jumping and swaying this way and that! This happened to me once before (during Speed 2) but that film was bad. This one was decent but was spoiled buy the director trying to hard.

The extreme SHAKEY close-ups were just too much! During the movie I had to look up at the ceiling to keep from feeling sick during some scenes. Couldn't they even afford a cheap tripod! Some of the shots were so close that you couldn't really even figure out what was happening. And frankly, by the end, I didn't even care.

The action scenes are packed with blurry rapid dramatic directing. The plot twists with shocks and at high pace - the interrogation moment is a class example of suspense and thrills - you know Bourne is gonna do something....but what? The mind tries to predict his movements - poor Bourne! He's so deadly fast and intelligent and more importantly believable (I'm glad he actually sustains injuries making the viewers promote the fact of his mortality - supremacy leads a false title sense of immortality).Overall: a truly great follow up from the Identity - hope they film the trilogy!,The Bourne Supremacy

It was a fantastic approach but I think that somewhere in between the standard camera view and the wobbly, out-of-control camera would have been much better - and I only thought this after the car chase which basically had me standing on my head trying to follow what was happening. However it did add a certain something to the action, even if at times it was slightly over the top.Still, it certainly deserves full marks.Role on The Bourne Ultimatum!",The Bourne Supremacy

Bourne supremacy was action packed, actors were excellent, great theme, BUT my eyes will never be the same after watching all the movement from the camera. Way too much movement for my eyes. I ended up with a terrible headache, my eyes were very sore from all the strain of trying to focus on what was happening, the scenes were not very pleasant to look at, all I found myself wanting to do was close my eyes. I went with my wife and another couple and all of us were complaining. It made our eyes hurt from all the strain it put us through. I'm a professional videogrpaher and I'm used to making my videos pleasant for the eye to look at. Any amateur could of done a better job. I wouldn't have accepted this kind of camera work.

616,audone1,Spoiler - Worst movie - ALWAYS out of focus. Plot hard to follow.,1,29 August 2004,I found this film very hard to follow the plot. I felt like I had missed the beginning.Do NOT see this movie if you have trouble with vertigo. I found even the scenes that had no movement were out of focus. The race scenes were very difficult for me to watch. They seemed like a constant blur.They were jumping from country to country with no definite sequence.My friend and I both thought that this was the WORST movie we had ever seen.The acting was bearable but certainly nothing to warrant an Academy Award.,The Bourne Supremacy

I love Franka Potente an am very upset she won't be a part of the third movie. Secondly, there were not enough hand to hand combat scenes featuring Matt. Finally, when the movie finished I had an empty feeling that meaning that it ended to abruptly. The Russian element was very vague. However, Hollywood needs to make a lot more movies like the Bourne series which are set in Europe. Action/ Thriller movies set in Europe are so much better than those set in the States. The scenery is ten times better in European cities. I'm hoping the Bourne series continues and that Jason Bourne finds a new woman and settles down and comes out of hiding only to rid the world of evil!!",The Bourne Supremacy

I absolutely could not follow any of the fight moves, everything was close up and choppy - unlike the fist movie which was clear, crisp, and shot in a way you could catch all of the unique moves from a distance. This gave me a headache.I was just getting used to the idea of Damon playing Bourne from the first movie, because I read the books, and he doesn't look at all like I pictured him in print. But then this installment comes out and ruins it. The movie plots don't even come close to what the books were about, well....except for the amnesiac assassin part. Carlos the Jackal and Bourne blending into the streets like chameleons chasing after each other, the hand to hand combat, and the paranoia, are what made the stories so good. All I can say is that at least they didn't cast DiCaprio or Hanks as Jason Bourne. This was just another Hollywood ruination of a decent story.",The Bourne Supremacy
620,gmorecambe,A great film which perfectly updates Robert Ludlum's great trilogy,10,12 September 2004,"This is a great film, and slightly reminiscent of the very early James Bond movies - taut and dark and not dependent on loads of special effects. The Bourne Identity was perhaps a more embracing film, but this second of the trilogy led us down a darker path that was both chilling and unexpected. Jason Bourne, the hero of the piece, has gone from being the good guy of the first film, to the good guy with a very bad past in the second film. This was unexpected as most great heroes of a first film tend to remain exactly that. But because of that it makes the whole series stay very much alive and interesting, and very in-keeping with the books. Some of the non-stop use of hand-held camera was at times oppressive, but did little to dampen a great film. Already looking forward to The Bourne Ultimatum - the final outing of the trilogy.",The Bourne Supremacy

Why not build on these and make another movie with those proven ingredients. Instead of capturing actions scenes as if you were part of the action and you still have a perfect sense of what is happening in the B.I., we get fuzzy shaky dizzy-making amateur level footage that makes you almost throw up in the B.S.. Instead of exploiting the great sexual tension between the boy and girl, we see the girl get wasted in the first 5 minutes. Bye bye balanced romance/action, bring in the bitterness and clichés.

After having seen the Bourne Identity, I was anxious and excited to see this sequel. I think Supremacy was as action packed as the first one, however, I couldn't tell for sure because I couldn't see what was happening. Director Paul Greengrass utilizes a technique that just doesn't work. The camera jumps and shakes so much throughout the movie that you miss half the story. All you see are blurred images in close up. There were points in the movie where I literally threw my hands up in the air and exclaimed, ""What just happened?""

And I suppose action movies have to have the standard car chase scene in them - but they are really starting to all look the same.Plot line wasn't great, but I suppose it could have been worse.

I hope that there will be a third installment! I love Matt and want to see him in more action/adventure movies. I give the Supremacy a 8 and two thumbs up.

Pity, because the story and the general setting as well as acting seemed to be OK. The predicted suspense was not experienced, but that's only attained in real top thrillers which this is definitely not. The general score at the moment is 7.4, so I wonder whether many people decided to stop watching before the film end and thus gave no vote.

After awhile of watching the movie you just get bored. Or confused. Hopefully for the next movie they get someone like Michael Mann, or Louis Leterrier. No offense to the crappy director but seriously I think that almost and don't get mad I said ALMOST anybody could have done a better job at directing.

And the constant use of a shaking picture is not nauseating but it is physically draining to watch the constant movement.The first move was definitely better.

Of course, you could also argue that I expected this film to be great, since I loved the first so much.

I can't say too much more without spoiling it, so go watch the film if you haven't already.

The Bourne Identity rocks,it's awesome, truly entertaining and fun... and to get compared with this sequel...

632,raddude-chan,Entertaining but misses the point of why Identity was so good,6,26 January 2005,"While definitely an engaging film that had me enthralled, The Bourne Supremacy is missing a key element that made The Bourne Identity such a great action film. That element was the bold decision to kill Franka Potentate's character in the first Act of the film. In Identity, Potentate gave a nice balance of humanity to Jason Bourne's character. The contrast between the cold blooded killing tactics and the warmth and awkwardness that Damon shows in his scenes with Potentate lent great sympathy and likability to him. By eliminating Potentate, Bourne loses that important balance that instead leans towards his brutal side. To make up for it, the Director decides to add on a cheesy ending with Bourne and the daughter of his victims.Also, by eliminating an essential character for Bourne to play against, Damon has very few lines of actual dialog. I bet if you counted the words spoken, that both Joan Allen or Brian Cox had more lines spoken than Matt Damon. It's a shame because Damon is a fine actor who shows great vulnerability despite being a stone cold killer.Lastly, Hollywood must stop the cliché use of hand-held cameras for action films. Designed to give the audience a feeling of chaos, hand-held cameras have instead become lazy film-making. A great director doesn't need to shake the camera to create scenes of chaos. Rather, the great ones create chaos on the screen all with a stationary cameras and tracking shots without leaving the audience nauseous.",The Bourne Supremacy
633,mjweisz,positive and negative,7,15 January 2005,"Over all it's a great sequel on the Bourne Identity, great actions... Only the nervous shots of the camera made me dizzy during the movie. Matt Damon, great actor! It doesn't matter what kind of role he plays, it always looks real. The movie continues with Matt kicking his opponents out of the way with great secret agent moves. A minus is, always is, that the bad guy starts shooting always in the rose... But when the ""hero"" comes into the picture, he gets nervous or something, and he just can't shoot in the rose any more. Somehow in every action movie this is always the case. The movie just doesn't get to the quality of the first part, most off all due to the disturbing way the action shots get on the screen.

The way the director made me feel Jason's pain I think I could write the third.A great movie leaves you feeling like your real life is not real at all.Both of the Bourne stories do that perfectly.Now if you will excuse me, I have a martial arts and sniper class that I am late for and.......I think someone is watching me.",The Bourne Supremacy
635,apurcell,Very disappointing...,5,5 August 2005,"I really enjoyed the first movie, The Bourne Identity. After watching it, I was eager to read the book series by Robert Ludlum. I read The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy and enjoyed both very much much more than the movies. My problem with the movie lies in the fact that it does not even attempt to follow the book. Besides the main character, Jason Bourne, there are almost no similarities.The first and most major difference was the characters. Right in the beginning of the movie, Bourne's wife, Marie, is killed when, in the books, she remains an important character until the end. There are other characters that shouldn't have been killed as well, but I saw the movie several months ago and I can't remember them.The second major difference is the setting and plot. The second book is based in Asia, mainly Japan and China. The plot is based around a Bourne impostor who the original Jason Bourne hunts down and kills. This movie, however, is set in Europe, with Bourne fleeing from the CIA, whose agents play a large role in helping him in the books.There are many problems with this movie, and I admit that I am biased because I read the books. If you haven't read them, then you will probably love this movie as the other reviewers did. Otherwise, be prepared for a major letdown as far as the book's plot is concerned.",The Bourne Supremacy
636,mister_neums,"Very good movie, ignore what others say.",9,3 February 2005,"I would have to say that in my experience with watching sequels for movies, that the Bourne Supremacy is one the best that i have ever had the pleasure of watching. The new director did things a specific way for a specific reason. The other user who commented on this gave the movie a horrible rating, which it is entirely unjustified. If the director did everything the same as Doug Liman, the movie would have seemed just like the first one, and thats where the problem lies in with sequels. Also, the fight scenes i thought were great. Maybe it was the viewer who was too drunk or something that was unable to understand was what going on. And if you are going to complain about movie realism, Bourne gets shot (again, however it was during a more crucial part of the movie), and he also sprains his ankle/leg. Another aspect that in The Bourne Identity that was great was the car chase: and Supremacy does not fail. The car chase in Supremacy was the best i have ever viewed. Other's say that the car chase in ""Bullet"" was better, i've never seen it so i can't comment.If you're looking for a great action movie, especially an under-recognized one, the Bourne Supremacy is a great choice.

Movies are directed in so realistic manner, credits goes to director and crew. Especially initial 3 series are so good and linking stories.Though the entire story line is fictional just like the novels, not just this movie the entire series of Bourne goes in whole new platform unlike most of other movie. In short, changed my view of ""Nonsense"" to ""New sense"" and impacted my life as well. 
Newly released Jason Bourne (2016), didn't made much of impact because i felt that movie was more focused to bring back the same previous scenario rather than story line.My suggestion is don't be hasty to release a movie & please don't spoil the image of Bourne meaning take your time he's movie make more sense in story line than actions just like novels.

638,daviduffy,Entertaining and completely inaccurate,7,22 January 2008,"Most of the time, when I watch a film that shares the same title as a book, I expect there to be a significant amount of material contained in the book that the film has left out, simply because there was not enough time. Needless to say, I was shocked when I watched this film.Perhaps I'm being to picky, but I think it's sad that nothing besides the names of a few prominent characters are shared between the book and the film. True, the most vague details of the plot are present - a killer posing as Jason Bourne sets a chain of events in motion that cause Webb to become Bourne again and apprehend the imposter. Apart from that, nothing else is remotely accurate: there is no mention of Goa or any other referenced to India in the book - Webb lives in Maine. None of Bourne's exploits take place in Europe, almost the entire book is set in the Far East. There is no visit to Russia, no Landy, no dramatic car chase, no bombed apartment, nothing of that sort in the book.Entertainment value is high - it is a good action movie.

Unlike Bourne Identity, this one is a real snooze. Damon's character is so dull & unsympathetic we don't even care if he clears himself of a phony murder rap. This is compounded by aimless dialog and gratuitous action scenes bereft of genuine suspense and inserted just to please a certain nonthinking audience of testosterone influenced adolescents.

I have'nt read Supremacy or Ultimatum so I'm not sure who original story is supposed to go. Just for the record, I think the 2 films so far have been terrific entertainment.

When watching, it felt that for 90% of the film, the camera was put on the camera man's shoulders and have him run around places. Bad. Idea. It felt more like watching a film where you have to watch blurry something or others happening and piece it together yourself. Third, anticlimactic ending. Bourne telling a girl things and having another girl telling him things after an overly long car chase (did I say it was overly long? Okay). Fourth, I felt that they could have done something with the especially sinister looking characters from the first one. Nope, nothing doing. I had so many questions about one of the characters, but I got questions answered about a guy I did not care about. And the plot took a turn in the wrong direction in my opinion. Pros One, the action scenes. Two, the first car chase and the first five minutes of the second. Third, its plot apart from the previous film. Four, uh, get back to on that. Like I said, could have been something good, but a rebellious plot and the camera got in the way.",The Bourne Supremacy
644,neptuneskissjm,Modern classic action movie,9,15 September 2017,"The Bourne Supremacy is a very clever and well balanced movie. It presents a realistic view to the life of spies who paid heavy prices and are living constantly at death door.It is one of the most fast paced action movie that does not rely on explosions and killing sprees. To achieve this, The Bourne Supremacy uses close-ups and quick transitions action scenes with high impact. Each move by Bourne is calculated and executed with a degree of realism.Notable highlights: final extended car chase, bridge sequence and Matt Damon Matt damon is prefect in his role with just the right amount of desperation and strength. Music, locations, pacing, dialogue and fight selections are all well designed.",The Bourne Supremacy
645,ppayne-2,Franka Potente was sorely missed.,5,9 December 2005,"What spoiled it for me were the non-stop close-ups during action scenes, especially the car chase. They gave me an awful headache. Pity we lost Franka Potente. I felt this follow-up sorely needed a lighter side. Without the romance, it was too dark and depressing.I liked the part where he explodes into action from being in an apparent zombie-like state when first arrested at the airport. But I felt that the toughness of the character was compromised by his seeking out the Neski daughter to confess the murder of her parents. A little longer and he might even have started crying!I sincerely hope the third movie in 2007 will be better than this. Why is it that follow-ups are usually much worse? Directors and Producers pay heed!",The Bourne Supremacy
646,richard-sinclair,The Bourne Supremacy was not as supreme as the Identity,8,23 July 2005,"The Bourne Identity was by far the better picture! By contrast, the Bourne Supremacy, although ""gritty"" and intense fell down in a number of areas. It's plot I considered weaker of the two and the transition between scenes a little awkward. The high speed car chase totally over the top and far too long. I'm an expert in martial arts and the fight scenes not well done; whereas, in the former picture they were quite believable. I'm sorry to say this, but the Supremacy was riding on the coat-tails of the first picture. Moreover, the story might have worked better if Jason Bourne(sic), rather than remaining a victim of amnesia was further developed into an actualized agent bent on exposing the corrupt circumstances he found himself in with the real possibility of vindication! Finally, the death of his love interest I thought was gratuitous. This was an area where her character might have been greatly expanded, it was the interaction between the two in the Identity that served to create an unusual tension: her totally naive to the man that she (and he, for that matter) were fast discovering was a trained operative with very uncommon skills.",The Bourne Supremacy
647,theodorepong,This movie is not based on Robert Ludlum's novel of the same title and does not even resemble it.,1,1 September 2005,"The plot line of Robert Ludlum's novels (Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy) is very very simple. A beautiful compassionate and skillful woman, Marie, marries a man, deeply wounded spiritually mentally and emotionally, David Webb, and helps him to find himself and heal, against an exciting background of CIA malicious manipulation.I suppose it is a spoiler to say screen writer Tony Gilroy decides to kill off one of the critical protagonists early on even though her role is critically fundamental to Robert Ludlum's plot, as is her happy reunion with him at the end of Supremacy, so I have labeled it a spoiler, but I have to mention it to vent my anger and dissatisfaction with this pornographic abortion of a film, and the fact that I was seduced into watching the thing because NO reviews I could find contained a ""spoiler"" to warn me away from it. All the way through, I hoped and thought even a psychopathic misogynist like Tony Gilroy would resurrect Marie in honor of her critical role clear to the end of the novel Supremacy.If Gilroy was so anxious to write the garbage he did, he has the right to do so, but why did he not at least have the decency to title it something of his own, but not the novel by Robert Ludlum? And where does he get the chutzpa to say it is ""based on the novel"" by Robert Ludlum?There is at least one bright side for me. At least if I ever see the name Tony Gilroy associated with another movie I will know enough to vow NEVER to see it, and warn all my friends and anyone else who will listen that it is probably a piece of pornographic garbage.",The Bourne Supremacy
648,emseguin,Wonderful and Unexpected!,10,10 February 2008,"This was a wonderful 3rd installment of the Bourne movies. Oh my gosh! It grabs you from the very beginning and you are immersed until the credits - literally. This is a WONDERFUL, NON-STOP, UNEXPECTED, CLEVER film that shows pure genius from all who created it and acted in it. A truly fantastic thrill ride, Matt Damon is by far THE BEST kick a** character that is Jason Bourne!!! I turned on this movie and next thing I knew it was over and I never wanted it to end ever!!! Crazy suspenseful throughout and a well drafted and played out film. Just when you think Bourne Identity and Ultimatum were utterly amazing, Bourne Supremacy takes on a whole new version of pure perfection.",The Bourne Supremacy
649,wilson_75,The Most Original Movie In Years,10,10 December 2005,"Oh Good Gracious! What a great movie. The Bourne Supremacy is a must see movie. Its by far the best and most original movie i've seen in years. Its packed full of intense action and amazingly entertaining. This isn't your typical government agent loses his memory movie, Jason Bourne is on a mission of his own and stops at nothing to complete it. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen from start to beginning, and car chase scene is amazingly intense and as well the best i've seen in years. This Movie defines ""great action movie"" and recommend to all. If you don't, you'll be missing out on what i find personally a favorite original action packed movie. Easy 10 rating",The Bourne Supremacy
650,iamfree-1,Bourne Supremacy,10,1 January 2006,"Aloha,Bourne Supremacy is truly an entertaining wonderfully fully done movie, really like the way Matt Damon plays the part. Watched it 6 times. The car chase is fantastic, camera's going all over the place, hopefully no one was hurt during the filming. Who plays the secret service Russian? Tall good looking man who chased Bourne in the taxi and the one who killed his girl friend? He does his part well also.......usually plays a similar part in other movies.Also love the sound track and wish I knew who composed it. Is the last songs titled ""Extreme Ways"", who sings it? And can I buy it?When will a new ""Bourne"" movie be out, hopefully soon!!!!! They are better than the James Bond Films.Thank you in advance! Aloha, ElizabethAloha",The Bourne Supremacy
651,greyknott,"A flashier,less considered reworking of ""Bourne Identity""",6,3 January 2006,"I think you get a warning very early in the film of the Style over Substance nature of the plot/direction etc., The killing off,of his girlfriend, trivialises violence against women to new levels.If Bourne was so concerned to find the reason he had become a target again,why did he not confront the hit-man instead of tragically (for her)running away? It's not that, at times, the movie does not generate excitement.But some of the over-the-top action seemed a repeat of the 'Identity plot but with an anarchic camera set on 'confuse' mode. So, to see it or not? Maybe...but if you haven't seen ""The Bourne Identity"", go there first!",The Bourne Supremacy

This movie is one of the most fantastic action movies ever. The actors and actresses, Joan Allen, Matt Damon, Julia Stiles, and Karl Urban all perform at there best. John Powell yet again makes fantastic music and new themes that involve different instruments and more complicated measures. This movie, with its actors, music, filming style, and the Bourne Identity to it's name is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my whole life. Yes, I have only lived for Twenty years, But I have been most of the countries mentioned in the movie. I have a great idea of what I am talking about. SEE THIS MOVIE!",The Bourne Supremacy
654,brandenmceuen,Great movie except for two things,6,25 November 2020,"Let me start by saying that in general, I thought the movie was very good. As in Identity, the pace was great, the score matched the feeling of the scene, and the acting was great from nearly the whole cast.That said, I have two major issues. The first, which many others have also mentioned, is the camera work, especially during the action scenes. Since others have said it better than me, I'll leave it at that.The other major issue is somewhat a fundamental part of the plot that I cannot get past. Bourne is said to be this ultimate assassin, who makes murders look like something else, and who, AS SAID IN THE FILM, ""does not make mistakes."" So, why does nobody ask the question of why Bourne's fingerprint was at the initial murder scene? Nobody asks why he would leave the fingerprint? Instead, they start a whole manhunt to find him while recognizing that they have no idea what his motive is.Aside from these two issues, though, the movie is great and is worth watching.",The Bourne Supremacy
655,lars222,Quite bad,3,20 January 2019,"A very disappointing sequel to a strong original. I think the only redeeming element was when the camera finally stopped shaking to give us some nice shots -- sigh of relief. Mainly lots of noise, pointless camera movement, and a script out of a CSI episode. A bit of a waste of talent, really.",The Bourne Supremacy
656,moopfhan,Enough with the jerky camera work!,3,20 March 2006,"Please! Aren't we all past that whole reality TV shaky camera gimmick? And don't tell me that it is necessary for a good action movie. I've seen plenty that don't use it. This movie may have good action and stunts, but we'll never know since you can't see anything with the all the split-second editing and ultra-fast pans. If you are susceptible to motion sickness, beware!Throw in a muddled plot line and this is a stinker of a movie. The ending was very anti-climactic. All in all, very disappointing.Too bad they're bringing the same director back for Ultimatum. I'll pass.",The Bourne Supremacy
