0,Leofwine_draca,"A good story, well told",6,5 June 2016,"A good story, well told is how I would describe this above-average American thriller that actually manages a certain level of intensity and momentum, two qualities I always look out for in my movies. It's a simple action thriller with a focus on movement and escape, as an American family visiting an unnamed south-east Asian country find themselves caught up in a coup and must literally flee for their lives.The reason NO ESCAPE is so effective is because the storyline is a believable one. There's a decent sense of realism built up from the outset and just enough time given to develop the characters before throwing them into the deep end. I admit I was a bit nonplussed about the casting of Owen Wilson, but he was acceptable as the lead just as he was in the non-comedy BEHIND ENEMY LINES all those years ago. The rest of the cast have little to work with, but Pierce Brosnan brings a wry humour as the British tourist the family hook up with at their hotel.The thriller sequences set in and around the hotel are by far the best bit of this film; they're edge of the seat stuff, with great cinematography to boost the action. After this point, the film drops down a notch and is never quite as thrilling; plus, I always dislike action set at night, because you can never see properly what's going on. Still, the hotel scenes alone are enough to make this a worthwhile watch.",No Escape
1,SnoopyStyle,some bad turns,4,21 March 2016,"Jack Dwyer (Owen Wilson) is an engineer going to his new job with Cardiff to rebuild the water system in an unnamed southeast Asian country. He brings over his wife Annie (Lake Bell), his daughters Lucy (Sterling Jerins) and Beeze (Claire Geare). They are helped by fellow traveler Hammond (Pierce Brosnan). The next morning, Jack leaves the hotel to buy a newspaper. Soon, he's in the middle of a revolution and the rebels are after foreigners and Jack in particular since Cardiff has bought up the local water.This could have been good scary idea for an American family caught in a foreign land in revolt. However, the problems start piling up. The first is the CGI-stunt of jumping from one roof to another. I'm fine with the idea but it tries to be cool rather than being scary and real. It does the slow motion and soft score route. It takes all the tension out of the moment. The girls are also problematic. The less they say the better. There is one good exchange but they are problematic in almost all the other times. Pierce Brosnan is another problem. It's OK to have him early on but there is no logic for him to reappear in the movie. His explanation of the situation is also another problem and basically simplifies world politics. The idea could be good but multiple things happen that take away the realism and the tension.",No Escape
2,Prismark10,Some jump scares,5,11 March 2019,"I was going to say why would anyone go to a far east country that is on the brink of a civil war.I then realised I took my family to Bangkok at a time when there was civil unrest. I think the Thais were unhappy that their Prime Minister was from Newcastle upon Tyne with a fondness for Brown Ale.In No Escape, Jack Dwyer (Owen Wilson) is an engineer who relocates for a new well paid job in south east Asia. The nation state is not mentioned.As they arrive Jack, his wife Annie (Lake Bell) and two young daughters are helped experienced traveller Hammond (Pierce Brosnan) who has a driver called Kenny Rogers who drops them off at their hotel.The next day Jack ends up in the middle of a riot, the rebels attempt to overthrow the government and kill all foreigners.Jack needs to get his family to safety. Luckily he crosses paths again with Hammond who is rather handy in a tight spot.No Escape is a tense but generic action movie. Owen Wilson plays it straight as the family man in peril.Brosnan supplies the gun play and quips. Some of the action scenes are ridiculous. The throwing the kids off a building defied gravity.",No Escape
3,claudio_carvalho,Tense Thriller,8,20 December 2015,"The American engineer Jack Dwyer (Owen Wilson) is expatriated to Southeast Asia to work in the water plant of his company. He travels with his wife Annie (Lake Bell) and their daughters Lucy and Beeze and befriends the English Hammond (Pierce Brosnan) at the airport. Nobody from his company comes to take Jack and his family to the hotel and he accepts the ride offered by Hammond with his local friend Kenny Rogers (Sahajak Boonthanakit). Soon Jack notes that the television, telephone, Internet and cellular do not work and the front desk explains that they are facing problems. On the next morning, Jack walks to the market to buy a newspaper, he discovers that there is a revolution in the country and the rebels are executing foreigners. Now his only hope is to reach the American Embassy with his family. But the rebels are everywhere and Jack does not speak or read the language of the country.""No Escape"" is an extremely tense thriller with a great storyline of an expatriated family that are surprised by a rebellion in the country where they have just moved. The tension is intense and the viewer that has been expatriated along his professional life will probably be more impressive with this film. The cast has wonderful performances and it is easy to understand the reaction of the annoying Lucy if the viewer is a father or mother. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Horas de Desespero (""Desperate Hours"")",No Escape
4,nogodnomasters,I LOVE HOW UNPREDICTABLE THIS HOTEL IS,8,15 July 2018,"Jack Dwyer (Owen Wilson) moves his family to a Southeast Asian nation (filmed in Thailand). He is an engineer for Cardiff, a company constructing the new water works. He meets Hammond (Pierce Brosnon) an ex-pat who drinks and causes civil unrest with his bad karaoke. The family is literally caught in the middle of a revolution, one where all foreigners must die. Jack and his family play hide and run for 90 minutes.You can feel the intensity in the film during the roof scene which is depicted on the film poster, DVD cover and is in all the trailers. The rest of the movie is anti-climatic by comparison. Pierce Brosnon does disappear from the film for awhile, but returns to give us ""the speech"" about third world countries, (IMF) debt, foreign interests, and economic enslavement. You know, the terrorists are really the good guys speech.The hide and seek part went long. In fact after the roof scene, I couldn't wait for the conclusion. Owen Wilson would not have been my first choice for the role. He didn't generate any excitement.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Near rape. Pierce Bronson assaults our ears with karaoke.",No Escape
5,kosmasp,Stranger,7,7 October 2016,"If you are new to a country, you may not be aware of the political climate, let alone know your way around (geographically speaking, but also conversation wise of course). That's the case here and what the movie is based on. You may argue that it portrays countries with lesser wealth than the industrial countries in a bad light. And I wouldn't necessarily argue against that. But it would damp and hinder you to enjoy the ride this movie otherwise is able to take you on.So if you can suspend your disbelief and want to go on a ride, this movie will be able to be the thriller for the family man/woman in you. Predictable to a degree and with a great appearance by former Bond Pierce Brosnan, this has all the tension you need.",No Escape
6,jboothmillard,No Escape,4,17 June 2020,"I had missed this on television a couple of times, all I knew about it was the title and the two male actors starring, and I didn't really care if it was rated a little low by critics, directed by John Erick Dowdle (Quarantine, Devil, As Above, So Below). Basically, somewhere in Southeast Asia, a Prime Minister (Vuthichard Photphurin) closes a deal with a representative of Cardiff, an American company specialising in water systems. After the representative leaves, a group of armed rebels initiate a coup d'état and assassinate the Prime Minister. Seventeen hours earlier, Jack Dwyer (Owen Wilson), new employee with Cardiff, is flying to the country with his wife Annie (Lake Bell) and their daughters Lucy (Sterling Jerins) and Briegel ""Beeze"" Dwyer (Claire Geare). After landing, they run into a Briton named Hammond (Pierce Brosnan) who offers them a ride with him and his friend ""Kenny Rogers"" (Sahajak Boonthanakit), to the Imperial Lotus Hotel, where many foreigners are staying. At the hotel, the phone lines, television, and internet are down all over the city. Jack stops by the bar and chats with Hammond. The next morning, Jack goes out to buy a newspaper, and inadvertently winds up in the middle of a conflict between armed protesters and the police. The two forces clash violently as Jack makes his escape. Eventually, the protesters gain the upper hand and begin killing the police. Jack runs back to the hotel and witnesses the rebels executing an American Cardiff employee. The rebels follow Jack, break through the barricaded main hotel entrance, and begin indiscriminately slaughtering the staff and guests. Jack makes it back to his family's room but learns that Lucy is swimming in the pool downstairs. Jack barely gets to Lucy in time before rebels try to attack them. A horrified Annie sees the rebels going from room to room, killing the guests. She narrowly manages to keep them out. As Jack returns with Lucy, Hammond saves him from a rebel in the stairwell, and tells him to get to the roof. Jack's family make it to the roof and join several hotel guests and staff who have gathered and blocked the door. On the roof, Jack is warned away from leaning over the edge of the roof, as the rebels below will shoot whoever they can see. Jack looks over anyway and sees that hundreds of rebels gathered outside the hotel, and that they have seized most of the city. A French hotel guest interprets what they are chanting, and they learn that the rebels are protesting the foreign corporations' control of the water supply. A helicopter is heard approaching, everyone is relieved as they believe they are being rescued. But then they run in terror as they realise it is the rebels, who open fire on the people below. As Jack's family runs for cover, the helicopter becomes entangled in electrical wires and crashes. Another band of rebels breaks through the blocked door and shoot most of the survivors, but Jack and his family manage to jump onto the roof of an office building opposite. Jack looks back and sees the rebels executing the remaining hotel guests and staff, and sees a rebel holding a poster of Cardiff with his face on it, realising he is a high-value target. After climbing down the building and breaking a window into an office, a tank targets the office, firing and killing many people inside. Jack's family hides under some debris as the rebels swarm the building and murder the office workers. The family hide until nightfall; they are surprised by a looting rebel, and Jack is forced to kill him, much to his and Annie's horror. They find a map and take clothes from dead office workers to disguise themselves, and on a stolen moped make their way to the American embassy. On the way they evade a crowd of rebel demonstrators, with only one person noticing them as foreigners, but not saying anything. Arriving at the embassy, they find it is overrun and deserted with several American guards dead, before feeling they are spotted by rebels, including the leader from the hotel massacre. The family takes shelter in a Buddhist shrine garden nearby, only for rebels to start searching for them. Jack attempts to steal a gun, while Annie tries to draw the rebels' attention away from Jack, while Lucy and Beeze hide. Jack finds the gun is unloaded and is restrained, and the group's leader is about to rape Annie. Then Hammond and Kenny appear, shooting most of the rebels, except for the leader who escapes. The family are taken to a place of safety, and while they eat, Hammond explains that he and Kenny work for the British government. He also explains the situation between agents and the former government which angered the people and led to the uprising. Hammond explains that their plan is to get to the nearby river, and sail a boat across the border to Vietnam, where they hope to receive asylum. As their children sleep, Annie and Jack tearfully comfort each other, preparing themselves for the fact that they could likely die. Before they can go ahead with the plan, the group is attacked by rebels, Hammond is wounded, and Kenny is killed. Hammond sacrifices himself to disable a rebel truck following them. Near the riverbank, Annie and the kids hide as Jack finds trades some belongings with a fisherman for a boat. The fisherman hears the rebels approaching, and hides Jack beneath an old boat. Not long after, the rebel leader comes back with another group, captures Jack, and prepares to execute him. Lucy leaves her hiding place, distracting the leader, who shoots Jack in the shoulder. The leader then catches Lucy, and tries to force her to shoot her father, or be shot herself. She refuses, but Jack encourages her to shoot him. Before Lucy can choose, Annie and hits the leader in the head, and bludgeons him to death, while Jack grabs a gun and kills the remaining men. The family paddle in a boat downriver toward the Vietnamese border. They are spotted by a group of rebels but keep going. The Vietnamese border patrol warn the family, at gunpoint, not to enter Vietnam, without taking action to stop them, but as soon as the boat crosses the border marker, the rebels are warned against attacking the family as they are now in Vietnamese waters, and any attack will be considered an act of war. The family is retrieved by border guards, they embrace each other, having finally reached the end of their ordeal. Later, in a hospital, Jack and Annie tell the story of how Lucy was born, a story the two daughters asked to hear many times. Also starring Nophand Boonyai as Concierge, and Kanarpat Phintiang as Bellhop. Wilson is perhaps slightly miscast as the everyman put in danger with his family, Bell does alright as his wife, and Brosnan, putting on a cockney accent, is a good to watch. The first half of the film is really engaging, with a massacre, lots of violence and explosions, past the point when they the American embassy it gets a bit tedious, obviously you go along with it and hope the family make it out alive, but overall it is a below-average action thriller. Okay!",No Escape
7,rmax304823,Close Encounters Of The Third World Kind.,6,13 July 2016,"Owen Wilson is an American engineer sent with his family to a nation in Southeast Asia to help build their waterworks.I've always liked Owen Wilson because of his nose. It can't seem to make up its mind which way to go as it meanders down along his midline. He's been quite good in some light comedies. Looking puzzled comes easily to him. His wife is Lake Bell, whose presence suggests genuine resolve. And they have two cute kids, ugh.""Ugh"" because movie kids generally don't add much to the texture of the film, with some exceptions, like little Joey in ""Shane."" These two girls are frightened to death and since this is a serious thriller they can be depended on to screw things up -- squealing at the wrong time, hanging back when they should be running, putting themselves in harm's way, and having to go potty.The movie begins on a reasonably good note. The morning of their arrival in wherever it is, nobody speaks English, the phones don't work, the TV is all snow, and the nearest newspaper is a three-day-old USA Today.But it soon devolves into what it always intended to be -- a chase picture. Rebels who resent Americans take over the city and, well, they PILLAGE it. With the sometime help of a Brit, Pierce Brosnan, Wilson rushes his family from their room in the hotel, to the roof, to the roof of the building next door, to the American embassy, to another roof, to the waterfront, and finally to the border of Vietnam where they find protection. (!) Everybody sweats a lot. All that running. There are explosions, gun shots, breaking furniture and windows, murders, and almost a gang bang. For what it is, it's good. No tedious fussing around about character development or establishing a cultural context -- not like ""The Year of Living Dangerously"" or ""The Killing Fields."" There's not a moment of peace and quiet, not a moment for either the characters or the viewer to have an uninterrupted thought. It's all tension and teeth-grinding anxiety from beginning to end. I had to bleed myself with leeches to quiet down afterward.If you're looking for an action movie, one that taps into the current wave of xenophobia, you need look no farther.Only it left me with a question. In the middle of all this brutal violence, the head honcho of the rebels is about to rape Wilson's wife. How -- surrounded by blood, dead bodies, gunsmoke, and danger -- can a man do it?",No Escape
8,edwagreen,**1/2,6,15 August 2016,"Yes, the film is exciting, adventurous and you feel that you're part of Owen Wilson and his family caught in the midst of a revolution.Where exactly in the southeast Asia is all this turmoil taking place?The film becomes quite routine with the family keeping everyone on edge as they're always one step ahead of the rebellious anti-foreigners ready to wipe them and other foreigners out. We have plenty of running, jumping, screaming and other form of mayhem to last a lifetime.You know times have changed when you see Pierce Brosnan looking a lot older, disheveled and reduced to a supporting role as the mysterious British traveler.",No Escape
9,sunwarrior13,A Political Thriller Without Thrills,5,6 November 2016,"Owen Wilson,Pierce Brosnan and Lake Bell star in this intense action film about an engineer expatriate who is trapped together with his family in an unidentified country in Southeast Asia when a violent political uprising occurred.John Erick Dowdle shares writing credits and directed this political thriller entitled No Escape.American Jack Dwyer,who conducts business in Southeast Asia decided that he and his family - wife Annie together with his daughters Lucy and Beeze - to settle into their new home.Then things go awry when a coup d' etat occurred and the Prime Minister gets assassinated.They find themselves trying to find a safe place as the rebels starts attacking the city. This was definitely a disappointing movie.No question about it.The story was interesting especially with the viewers getting to know more about the political climate in Southeast Asia but lacks tension and suspense that it so obnoxious that it classifies itself as an action political thriller.The first half of the film was decent especially when we get introduced to the characters and the political climate of the country wherein they are located.Good thing that the first half of the film was decent enough for it not to merit the lowest rating.But the next half was simply awful as the family try to escape to another country wherein there exists scenes that nothing is practically happening for more than 15 minutes.The viewers are basically treated to a camera movement with actors and actresses staying at one place and not talking at all. It was simply bad filmmaking.",No Escape
10,Theo Robertson,Sorry Guys I Think I Have Different tastes,5,21 December 2015,"One topic that often crops up at work is cinema . One of my colleagues Ross recommended me a film called NO ESCAPE . Asking what it was about Ross explained it was set in an Asian country and Owen Wilson must lead his family to safety away from murderous mobs ""Ah so it's a bit like that film The Purge Anarchy ?"" ""A bit , except it's not a horror film""TPA was probably my favourite movie from last year , heavily influenced by the Greek myth Anabasis by Xenophon . A good premise never grows old and top of that another colleague Valento gave me some positive feedback saying how much he thoroughly enjoyed NO ESCAPE so made this movie a priority in my one to watch list To be fair to Ross and Valento they're both obviously family men but this is where the film falls down . The family aspect is painfully over done and feels like some scenes belong in a Walt Disney movie . This clashes in a disjointed manner with the scenes of violence which belong in an entirely different film . The producers haven't given much thought to what type of market the film is to appeal to The lack of thought is also reflected in the politics . The indigenous population jump to the conclusion that the white man is stealing their water supply then we've got something similar to Kampuchea year zero . Sorry but I couldn't buy in this . At least with THE PURGE ANARCHY the scenario has an internal logic - one of eliminating undesirables by the state - where as here the story needs a motive in order to set up the plot but it doesn't really work and seems weak . Indeed much of the plotting is very weak and ill thought out with scenes that don't make much sense such as a character swimming in a hotel pool while the rest of the occupants are being murdered in their rooms So apologies to Ross and Valento and I'll listen to anymore recommendations you guys make but I think we have different tastes in movies",No Escape
11,LeonLouisRicci,"Suspenseful & Gripping, Makes the Most of its Resources",8,2 January 2016,"The word most often used to describe this Sleeper is ""Intense"", and it surely is. But the Film has garnered much criticism for its sloppy Politics and highly improbable scenario. However, the majority of Critics missed this one ""Big Time"". It's relatively low budget could not allow for a more wide open display of the ""Army"" of Rebels and the Story has been reduced to Headlines and borders on sophomoric.But the Movie is one Hell of a ride. Owen Wilson, shows once again just how good of an Actor He is. Playing against Type He nails the Role of a Corporate Elite Family Man and along with Lake Bell as the Wife and the two small Children are more than believable in the demanding, taxing, and grueling take on Americans relocated to a Third World Country and find themselves in the middle of a Political Coup and are targeted specifically.Forget the depth of the Story and You will be highly engaged in this ""Nail Biter"", as it delivers a visceral, sometimes very unpleasant Thriller. The violent template is truly believable and the gripping Film is a non-stop Suspensor. Highly Underrated.",No Escape
12,zardoz-13,Save The Family!!!,8,5 September 2015,"Occasionally, life imitates art, even in the cinema. ""As Above, So Below"" director John Erick Dowdle's ""No Escape,"" qualifies as a spellbinding, 'stranger-in-a-strange land' saga about an amiable American family scrambling to stay alive during a cataclysmic coup in a nameless Southeast Asia nation. Initially, when Dowdle took his cast and crew to Thailand back in 2013 to lens this gritty, straightforward, action-thriller, few knew the smoldering political unrest would flare up into a full-scale military insurrection in 2014. Moreover, the recent August 2015 bombing at a popular Hindu shrine that killed 20 people and wounded more than 100 has heightened the plausibility of Dowdle's nail-biting, no-nonsense thriller. Originally, this Weinstein Company release was entitled ""The Coup,"" but audiences couldn't relate to this bland title so the producers changed it. Reportedly, when Dowdle made ""No Escape,"" he went to painstaking lengths not to specify Thailand as the film's setting. Additionally, the filmmakers refrained from using the color yellow in their palate because it represents Thailand's official color and its royalty. This white-knuckled but xenophobic exercise in suspense dispenses with comic relief, clever one-liners, and qualifies as a cautionary tale for tourists contemplating a vacation in Thailand. Indeed, China, Australia, and Hong Kong officials have issued travel warnings to tourists about Thailand. In Dowdle's R-rated epic, rampaging mobs armed with sticks, stones, machetes, knives, revolvers, and assault rifles declare an 'open season' on tourists and those who accommodate these foreigners. Ostensibly, ""No Escape"" has been lambasted by many film critics because it depicts the rebel natives in a demonic light but portrays tourists, particularly Americans, as if they were saints. ""Empire"" magazine critic Simon Crook has even gone so far as to compare ""No Escape"" with a zombie movie and Americans as the endangered species!Austin, Texas, engineer Jack Dwyer (Owen Wilson of ""Behind Enemy Lines"") represents a benevolent American company dispatched to an unknown Asian country to improve the quality of the water supply. Events beyond Jack's control have forced him to take this dreadful job because his other enterprises haven't worked out for him. Predictably, Jack refuses to fly off to this exotic, faraway, fourth-world, paradise with packing along his family, wife Annie (Lake Bell of ""Pride and Glory""), and their two daughters. Imagine a Brady Bunch with only two children finding themselves swamped in a blood and gore revolution with bloodthirsty natives dying to kill them, and you've got the gist of ""No Escape."" Dowdle and his brother Drew who helped him script ""Quarantine"" spend the first ten minutes or so of ""No Escape"" introducing us to Dwyer and his happy family. Adorable daughters Lucy (Sterling Jerins) and Beeze (Claire Geare) are elementary school aged moppets who are no more prepared than their parents for the perilous predicaments that await them. What the Dwyers don't know is that the country's current President has just been terminated with extreme prejudice by ruthless terrorists. You know things are bad when the President's personal bodyguard takes one look at what has happened and slashes his own throat. Meantime, the Dwyers have checked into the motel, and Jack has gone downstairs to report that nothing seems to work in his room when he spots a fellow passenger from his plane performing karaoke. Hammond (Pierce Brosnan of ""GoldenEye"") is a grizzled, alcohol-imbibing Briton who knows the country like the handle of the automatic pistol that he conceals on his person. Hammond and his native grinning pal Kenny (Sahajak Boonthanakit of ""Elephant White""), who owns a taxi plastered with posters of country music crooner Kenny Rogers, help the Dwyers commute from the airport to their motel without being taken advantage of by the locals. Jack leaves the motel to buy a USA Today newspaper and finds himself caught between rioters wielding bombs, baseball bats, and guns and the police armed with helmets and shields. Jack knows that his goose is cooked when the rioters scatter the police and start executing Americans as well as any locals who appear to be collaborating with the American devils. The first obstacle the Jack and Annie face is getting out of their motel room without being slaughtered. They join other nervous tourists barricaded atop the motel roof. Initially, an approaching helicopter allays their anxieties. Ironically, the chopper carries rebels equipped with machine guns who aren't about to rescue anybody. Jack realizes their only alternative is to jump to nearby high-rise building. If you've seen the ""No Escape"" trailer, you'll be prepared for this ordeal as the Dwyers hurl their horrified kids into the sky toward the other building. These taut moments will grip you with chilling terror, and things escalate for the worse as they flee for freedom. One crucial scene shows the entire family astride on a motorcycle that the father pushes through waves of irate rebels, but only one rebel spots their Nike sneakers. Later, when Jack barters for a boat so they can cross into Vietnam, he has to surrender his Nikes.""No Escape"" reminded me of a long dormant film genre that flourished during the Cold War in the 1960s. In a game of political dominoes with the Communists, imperialist Americans sought to convert Southeast Asia countries to capitalism. Specifically, the Marlon Brando diplomatic thriller ""The Ugly American"" (1963), concerned Uncle Sam's meddling in local politics where those empire-building antics were not appreciated. Meantime, ""No Escape"" conjures up a harrowing portrait of heroism under fire. The imperiled American family emerges as whitewashed saints, while virtually all of dark-skinned Asians are hopelessly maniacal miscreants. Mind you, it is difficult not to root for Wilson and his family, especially when former James Bond star Pierce Brosnan sacrifices his life to rescue them from their homicidal Asian adversaries. Although Owen Wilson is best known for his smarmy comedies, he sheds his light-hearted image here. ""No Escape"" will keep you poised on the edge of your seat, even when you know you're being shamelessly manipulated for the sake of thrills and chills.",No Escape
13,oscaralbert,Any American who leaves our U.S. borders has rocks . . .,9,3 September 2015,". . . in their head, NO ESCAPE teaches us. Owen Wilson's ""Jack"" character is from the State of Texas, where people are too busy watching high school football, blowing tumbleweeds, and scuttling armadillos to view many--if any--movies. Obviously, Jack and his wife ""Annie"" never have seen TURISTAS, HOSTEL I & II, THE IMPOSSIBLE, or the thousands of other flicks proving how Americans are doomed once they leave the safety of U.S. soil. (Some people claim the Canada MIGHT be okay for a brief visit since--if you try hard enough--you may be able to have a halting conversation with some of the brighter English-speaking Canadianites, but given all the exploding planes trains & automobiles, rare disease pandemics, and rampaging moose, it doesn't seem all that safe up there!) I doubt anyone can watch NO ESCAPE, and THEN consider dragging their kids overseas into an unstable country such as Thailand, Russia, or France. You can bet the NEXT time we have a 9-11 here, Fortress America will BAN all international flights (if not ocean cruises, as well).

14,neil-476,A good thriller with some excellent performances,8,11 September 2015,"Jack Dwyer takes his wife and two small daughters to an un-named country to start a new job. Their arrival coincides with a violent revolution in which westerners are being slaughtered. According to oddball Hammond, their only chance of survival is to escape to Vietnam.We know from the start about the revolution so, thankfully, the set-up which follows as a flashback is fairly brief: just enough to let us make an emotional investment in Jack (Owen Wilson), wife Annie (Lake Bell), daughters Beeze and Lucy (Claire Geare and Sterling Jerins), and Hammond (Pierce Brosnan) and his taxi-driving friend Kenny Rogers (Sahajak Boonthanakit). Then, once the action starts, it never stops. More precisely, the sense of threat never stops – even during quiet moments you are aware of the danger these people are constantly in, and that is the main strength of the movie.There are a couple of deus ex machine moments which seem a little improbable, and Brosnan's characterisation seems a little more geared towards sitcom than action thriller, but that is more than compensated for by the palpable sense of jeopardy, and the excellent performances from the family. It is a great pleasure to see Wilson doing something other than his customary laid-back persona, and Bell is wonderful. But the real joy here is the two girls who are, quite simply, superb.From the trailers, this looked like a formulaic thriller: there is more to enjoy here than simply the thrills.",No Escape
15,ferguson-6,Kenny Rogers Taxi Company,5,25 August 2015,"Greetings again from the darkness. An effective thriller must either put real people smack dab in the middle of believable peril or facilitate the suspension of disbelief. This latest from writer/director John Erick Dowdle (co-written with his brother Drew Dowdle) takes bits of each of those approaches and provides a pretty intense ride despite the mostly nonsensical happenings.We pick up Owen Wilson and his family while on an a transatlantic flight to his new job in some unnamed Asian country that we later learn is just a couple miles down river from the Vietnam border. Not long after their arrival, the generic Prime Minister of this unnamed country is assassinated. The rebel forces responsible for the coup were evidently motivated by the political ploy of Owen's company, and they aim to kill him.Lake Bell plays Owen's wife, and the two of them spend most of the movie on the run together while protecting their two young daughters. Ahh yes, the daughters. While watching this, it made me think that the writers must not be parents, as the kids' reactions to this extraordinarily dangerous situation involves excessive whimpering combined with whining for food. Anyone without kids will certainly not want any after watching this.One of the family's earliest escape sequences involves leaping from one rooftop to another, and all I could think of was how fortunate that this was not a typical American family who, shall we say, struggles with the effects of a fast food diet. In addition to the long jump, Owen Wilson takes over the record for best on screen child toss an under-appreciated cinematic category.The writers do deserve credit for understanding that Owen and his little family were insufficient to hold our attention for the full run, so they threw in a bizarre super agent played by Pierce Brosnan or Liam Neeson, or Bruce Willis, or maybe Chuck Norris. No, no - it really was Pierce Brosnan. Action sequences appear spontaneously with Brosnan's character, as do the funniest lines and the Kenny Rogers taxi company.There do seem to be some conflicting story lines. On one hand the big Western corporation is cast as the villain who cares only to capitalize on the local citizens, yet on the other hand, we as viewers are supposed to root for the cute white family as they run from the rebels. Perhaps this is over-thinking something the filmmakers won't be accused of.Most movie lovers enjoy a thriller that creates tension, and there is no shortage of intensity here. Just don't expect to buy into everything you see.",No Escape
16,Wizard-8,Not bad at all,7,26 December 2018,"I put off watching this movie for a long time because of various reasons, and I just recently watched it on Netflix. I wasn't expecting much, but to my surprise, I thought the end results were pretty good. This certainly isn't a perfect movie (though very few movies are that way). The script has some flaws, such as the fact that there isn't a terrible amount of character development, though more development might have slowed down the movie significantly, and the central characters are all the same sympathetic. Also, the reason eventually explained for the coup also don't go into much detail. When it comes to the direction of the movie, often the movie suffers from a very claustrophobic feeling, with the camera jammed close to the character instead of stepping back a few feet. A ""wider"" feel would have really shown the scope of the coup, though maybe the filmmakers were hampered by a budget that wasn't incredibly high.Despite those aforementioned flaws, the movie still works well. It does often have an authentic feeling for what a chaotic (and violent) coup may be like. This results in a lot of genuine tension, as well as some pulse-pounding action. There isn't a slow or boring spot anywhere in the movie; you'll be grabbed and interested from start to finish.

Jack must get back to the hotel and with the help of a mysterious Brit, must get his family to the American Embassy in the midst of the chaos......Owen Wilson is really known for his dramatic prowess. You'd be forgiven if you were expecting his laid back stoner-esque persona he accommodates in almost all of his films.But here, as the desperate parent, he's pretty solid trying to keep them out of harms way. The initial take over is overwhelmingly intense, because these are just everyday people, and have no training or forewarning to the events that are about to take over the narrative.The action is taut and there is one set piece involving a rooftop escape that really puts you on the edge of your seat.And then Pierce Brosnan walks in from the set of another film and offers to help Wilson and his family. Brosnan is watchable in everything, even Die Another Day, but here, he's just your stereotypical ex marine type who appears to have an accent like he had his own punk group in the early eighties.But it's a surprisingly well made films, with a great performance from Wilson, who proves that he can do something other than a coasting stoner.It gets a bit preachy toward the end, but the first two acts are quite brilliant.",No Escape
18,phd_travel,Exciting and scary - go see it,10,27 August 2015,"This thriller about an American family caught up in a bloody coup in an unnamed South East Asian country is exciting from start to finish. It's a fictional thriller with elements of some real terror we have seen in true stories like 'Hotel Rwanda' and 'The Killing Fields'. The on location (Thailand) filming is atmospheric.The action from the street fighting to the hotel rooftop to the office building and embassy is nail bitingly tense. Owen Wilson shows he is convincing and believable in dramatic roles. He was great in 'Behind Enemy Lines' and it's good to see him back in a non comedic role again. Lake Bell plays his supportive wife and it's good they make her character quite likable and non irritating. The kids on the other hand have just a couple of annoying scenes as expected.Pierce Brosnan acts as a British agent of some sort who provides the political correctness by explaining that exploitation by Western governments and companies caused the coup. Some criticisms of this movie aren't fair. It's not fair to say it's unrealistic or ridiculous, it is a thriller so that's like saying 'Mission Impossible' is unrealistic. Another is that portraying a South East Asian country with such brutal savagery is 30 or 40 years out of date. Actually it had to be a relatively stable place or he wouldn't have taken his family there. Things explode suddenly. If you think about it, it's not really that far fetched.

23,StevePulaski,Fulfilling entertainment with slickly (and clearly) edited action,7,26 August 2015,"John Erick Dowdle's ""No Escape"" is a taut thriller, nicely edited and strongly paced, resulting in a film that knows exactly how to get your adrenaline up and your movie-going senses tingled. Dowdle has been a strong force in the horror genre ever since his seldom-seen, largely unreleased debut ""The Poughkeepsie Tapes"" came onto the scene in 2007. Since then, Dowdle has proved his ability to direct claustrophobic thrillers such as ""As Above, So Below"" and ""Devil,"" solidifying his filmography as dynamic and rounded, especially for a horror/thriller director.""No Escape"" is his most mainstream project to date, with a bigger scale than his previous films and bigger stars as well. Set in Southeast Asia, we focus on Jack (Owen Wilson), his wife Annie (Lake Bell), and their children Lucy and Breeze (Sterling Jerins and Claire Geare), who are moving to Asia for Jack's new job. Not long after being in the land, Jack's morning walk to get a newspaper results in him racing back to his hotel, following an all-out war between law enforcement and natives in the cluttered streets. Riots, looting, and inexplicable violence break out in the streets and Jack and his family must find a way to Vietnam where they can declare asylum. They seek out the help of Hammond (Pierce Brosnan, who provides darkly comic relief in many scenes), a skilled survivalist who is seen traveling on the plane with them to Asia, who assists in finding them temporary places to stay amidst all the madness.Assertions have flown over the alleged ""racism"" of ""No Escape""'s story, due to the negative portrayal of Asian natives and the constant danger and sanctity of this white family being challenged, in addition to being the prime concern, throughout the course of this picture. I bring this up not to challenge the position, for it is somewhat valid, but how come films like ""Taken,"" which is operating on the same playing field as this film, isn't as slammed as this film is? Was that picture just too entertaining for the subtext to be noticed, or were we too distracted by Liam Neeson in that film to really care?""No Escape,"" however, can claim more than ""Taken"" can as film because ""No Escape""'s strengths come in the regard of its editing and camera-work, two things I was worried about walking into this film. Chaotic action films like these are ripe for sloppy aesthetics, which can, in turn, ruin any ability to see the action, let alone really care about what is happening to the characters. Dowdle and editor Elliot Greenberg are smart about how they shoot and edit this film, never settling for anything other than shots and editing tactics that allow for immersion and clear placement for the audience. In addition, Greenberg's editing provides some elements of structural pacing, which work to ""No Escape""'s favor, especially during the more chaotic scenes.The only element that subtracts from what ""No Escape"" does so uniformly well with its aesthetics is the convenience of the plot. Throughout the film, characters are put in compromising positions, including one scene at the end that comes so close to making this film great and almost entirely amoral, but finds ways through miraculous scenarios to get them out of harm's way in the nick of time. This ostensibly comes from writers John Erick and Drew Dowdle's dueling desire to up the film's stakes but simultaneously back down and not make things too drastic. For as heartless as some scenes of the film can be, it would've only been fitting to see some of the more serious, morally corrupt scenarios to follow through.""No Escape"" still works as a basic, fulfilling film; a pulsating action film with various elements of a thriller directed by someone with an evident list of ideas and edited by someone who understands the value of pacing and crystal-clear editing.",No Escape

Overall this movie is about a family trying to survive in Southeast Asia from ticked off rebels. With a old badass trying to protect them from harms way. This movie had some negative response from critics, mainly because of the way it perceives some of it's nations people. Which has been done a lot in other movies as well. Watching this movie was like watching a zombie flick, except with living people trying to kill a family that is trying to survive by getting to a specific destination. It was pretty much entertaining from start to finish, but lacked the momentum and impact it needed. Despite few tense situations and moments. There just wasn't that deep character interaction and development and focused more on the hide and seek elements.

26,sddavis63,A Non-Stop Heart Pounder!,9,14 December 2015,"There were scenes in this movie when I literally felt as if my heart was going to pound its way out of my chest. Among other scenes I'm thinking of the extremely quease-inducing one where the Dwyers have to leap from one building roof to another to escape those trying to kill them - and as part of it they actually have to throw their young children across the open space from one roof to another. I could barely watch that scene. And has there been a more horrific scene filmed than the one in which young Lucy Dwyer (who can't be more than 10) has a gun put to her head and another in her hands and is told she'll be killed unless she kills her father. There are several times in this movie where the title seems to be the only possible conclusion. Surely there's no escape for this family.""No Escape"" is set in a fictional country in southeast Asia. All we know from the plot is that it borders Vietnam. Jack Dwyer (Owen Wilson) has taken a job with an American company in that country, only to find that virtually the moment he arrives, a violent anti- American revolution breaks out and he and his family are being sought out along with every other American, and every other westerner. It's sometimes a disorienting movie, set in a large city. Having visited the Chinese cities of Beijing and Changsha, the portrayal of the city seemed authentic. China is a peaceful country, but everything was chaotic enough that I didn't venture out too far on my own for fear that I'd end up hopelessly lost. Jack and his family are running for their lives, disoriented and lost, with danger potentially lurking around every corner. The atmosphere was great. It's truly one of the most intense movies I've ever seen.The performances from the leads were all superb. I haven't seen Wilson in too many serious roles, but he seemed perfectly cast as Jack, and I was very impressed with Lake Bell, who played Jack's wife Annie, with whom I was previously unfamiliar. The children were fantastic. Played by Sterling Jerins (who was Lucy in the above- mentioned scene) and the even younger Claire Geare, they didn't miss a beat. There was no ""irritating child actor"" thing going on here. Jerins and Geare hit the mark perfectly. Pierce Brosnan rounded out the main cast as some sort of British agent who helps the Dwyers in their desperate attempt to escape.This is one of the best suspense/thrillers I've seen in a very long time. To the extent that it has weaknesses, perhaps it started out a little bit slow - but only for a few minutes, and once the action starts it doesn't stop. It also might have been helpful if the revolution had been a little more clearly explained. All we know is that there's resentment against this American company Jack has arrived to work for. But those are minor weaknesses. I haven't really come across too many movies that have literally kept me glued to the edge of my seat. This one did. (9/10)",No Escape
27,Hellmant,"Plenty of good suspense and terror, even if his script sucks!",6,18 September 2015,"'NO ESCAPE': Three Stars (Out of Five)Action/thriller flick, directed by John Erick Dowdle (the director of such recent horror films as 'QUARANTINE', 'AS ABOVE, SO BELOW' and 'THE POUGHKEEPSIE TAPES') and written by John and his brother Drew Dowdle (the duo also co-wrote the previously mentioned thrillers). It stars Owen Wilson, as an American engineer that moves his family to South East Asia; to lead a new water manufacturing plant there. He ends up getting them stuck in the middle of a viscous rebellion, where all foreigners are being brutally executed, and he tries to find them a safe way out. The movie also stars Lake Bell and Pierce Brosnan. It's filled with some pretty intense and suspenseful moments, even though the story and characters are poorly developed. Wilson plays Jack Dwyer; a successful American engineer, with a wife (Bell) and two young daughters (Sterling Jerins and Claire Geare). He's moving his family to Southeast Asia, to help startup a new water manufacturing plant there. Upon arrival, Jack learns that the country is being taken over, by violent rebels leading a coup, and his family is in severe danger. He struggles to desperately lead them to safety, at the American Embassy, and finds help from a skilled British tourist (Brosnan). The movie is pretty simplistic, not a lot of detail is put into the explanation for the horrific takeover, and the characters are not well thought-out either. Wilson is great, as the heroic lead, and Brosnan is a scene-stealer. I also like Dowdle's direction, he definitely knows how to play out suspense and terror, even if his script sucks. The movie is worth seeing, for the thrills and the two leading men performances; other than that it's mostly forgettable.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/553rKMZCAwE",No Escape
28,thesar-2,Un-American Horror Story,3,28 November 2015,"With social media these days, there are so many people telling too many others what offends them. Truth is, very little offends me. However, this movie truly brings to light one that bothers me a ton: violence and killing in disguise as ""justice"" or a statement. Any human being that has to kill or torture another life is absolute scum. Satan incarnate. No exceptions.AlsoNo escaping it: this movie made me incredibly happy that I live in the United States of America. Granted, the locale featured was under some dumb revolution, and we have our share of rioting as well, but I absolutely feel safer and freer here than any other country I've seen or visited.Rantsover. The movie's action and suspense were pretty good as it follows a terrifyingly naïve father who's trying to protect his wife and two daughters who both seemingly felt like they're in a kiddie adventure film vs. this horrifying escape movie. I understand some families move across the globe for higher pay work, but damn it boy, do some research. This father, who also seems like he's joking his way through a buddy frat movie instead of a serious riot film, supposedly and ""almost"" invented a valve and yet can't even Google anything about the place he is about to put his family's life in peril. The saving grace here was the always fantastic Pierce Brosnan and the action surrounding him. Though this movie kinda wants you to take it seriously and believe that despite the title, our hero father must escape with his family, the movie is a true Leave-Your-Brain-In-The- States movie. It's best just not to think of how dumb most of this movie is (namely the father and poor girls that can't shut up or remotely attempt to understand what's happening) and turn off all logic during.",No Escape

30,Robert_duder,"An incredibly intense, politically charged thriller",9,3 September 2015,"If No Escape doesn't wind up on my best 2015 list I'll be awfully surprised. This is one of those movies that I went into almost blind. I don't think I ever saw a trailer and I had read the synopsis but that's it. So I'm not sure what my expectations were but whatever they were, it exceeded them exponentially. Not only is the acting absolutely excellent but the story is so intense, you will literally be on the edge of your seat the entire time. Other people in the theatre gasped and cried out and you will find yourself holding your breath more than once. There is a distinctive feeling of reality to this film. You know that this happens in the world and it brings it to the forefront so we can't ignore it as we so often do in Western society. The critics of this film all seem to say the same, politically its too simple, its racist in its portrayals of the rebels?!?! First of all...it doesn't need to be complicated. The outbreak of violence is clearly and simply explained. There is no more or less to it. Second of all...pulling the race card is ludicrous. There are groups of rebels out there that behave in this manor. We all know genocide happens in the world and now we see it. There are good people in this country, victims and there are the people involved in the uprising. Whether or not you believe their cause is justified is totally up to you but the film is the furthest thing from racist. If anything there is a particular scene that almost justifies their anger.Owen Wilson...Mr. Wilson...stop comedy now. You haven't had a good comedy in a very long time and you excel at serious roles like this. Wilson is absolute perfection. In my movie world I would bestow an Oscar nomination on him. He's a dedicated father and husband, he's tortured with the idea he put his family in harms way and he will do anything to protect them. He is an every-man, he perfect hero and really nails this role. Lake Bell is also excellent as his wife. She shows intensity and the same love for her children as Wilson displays. The two of them together are terrific and they both have some really great scenes that establish how good of a performance they give. Sterling Jerins and Claire Geare as magnificent as their two children. It will break your heart to see these two children in distress. Their family is so real and you just root for them and you are constantly right there with them biting your nails for their safety. Pierce Brosnan's role is actually very small but that being said, he is a welcomed addition. He is a breath of air to the intensity of the film and even adds just a little witty comedy to a couple of scenes without it seeming misplaced. He also adds to the action and testosterone and proves he's still got the chops to be an action guy. His final scene is right out of a great action flick.I think that's one of the issues that critics are having with this movie. Is it an action movie? Is it just mainstream entertainment or are they trying to tell a real story here? I think its somewhere up the middle. It is very entertaining and it absolutely has a few glaring plot holes like any action film and that's why it isn't getting a 10 from me. I do agree that the Vietnamese at the end should not have spoke English. That was a major miss on the film makers part. Did it ruin anything for me? No. There is way too much good to this to let plot holes ruin it. There are all easy to overlook. Director and co-writer with his brother John Dowdle comes from experience in the horror genre so I can see where his story telling and expertise comes in this film but I also think he's trying his hand at something serious. This is a story that could easily happen and does happen. My advice to critics is to lighten up and look for the good because I was so glad to walk into this film. I had a great time and it flew by because the intensity, action, story and characters drew me in and I would see it again and again. An absolute must see. 9/10",No Escape

They strike up a friendship with British mercenary Hammond (Pierce Brosnan), which will soon become more handy than they could have imagined. After the president's recent assassination, warring gangs have now staged a coup, and are soon tearing the streets apart with relentless ferocity. Jack must do whatever it takes to protect his loved ones...No genre takes creative licence with logic and reality quite like action, where even just a vague hint of nonsense can feel like an essential ingredient in the overall plot line. No Escape sets its cards on the table pretty early on, with Wilson and his family incredulously accepting a lift from Brosnan's eccentric co-passenger, having only met him moments before. This implausible opening sets the tone for what's about to follow. While it opens well, conveying an impressive sense of impending crisis, it soon seems to have descended into a standard thriller that fails to maintain its sense of pace.Cast wise, Wilson has too much of an established comedy background and too much of a comedy face to be as convincing as possible, whilst it's clear Brosnan has entered the autumn of his career now, appearing in supporting roles in such films when at one time he was the striking leading man. That's not to say he fails to make an impression in such a role here, and indeed he does add it a certain gravitas all of his own, it's just piecemeal compared to what once was.For a film that seriously risks damaging diplomatic relations between the US and the South East, portraying them as wild maniacs who start a riot during times of any political unrest, No Escape is a slightly dodgy gamble.

32,bowmanblue,Not the Ray Liotta version,7,22 February 2017,"Growing up in the nineties the film 'No Escape' always brought up images of Ray Liotta's (possibly only!) attempt at headlining a major motion picture. However, there are no gangs of cannibals here in a sci-fi prison island. Although, to be fair, Owen Wilson and his family doesn't have it that much easier! Wilson leaves America with his family and goes to work in a far eastern country. All sounds perfectly okay enough, until a major uprising happens and gangs of armed killers start roaming the street trying to put a bullet in the head of anyone with an American accent. Therefore, what follows is movie about Wilson trying to get the hell out of 'Dodge' before he ends up on the wrong side of an AK47.'No Escape' is hardly 'story-driven' – I've pretty much given you all you need to know as far as the plot goes. Some might say that Wilson is an unlikely choice for an 'action hero' but this isn't a film about a lone hero gunning down infinite waves of bad-guys. He's here to play the 'everyman' which he has already proved that he can do with his (fleeting) non comedic roles. 'No Escape' is hardly a 'feel-good' movie and paints a pretty bleak picture of a country in crisis, especially when it leans towards social commentary (mainly courtesy of Pierce Brosnan's character filling in some of the background as to the hows and whys of the situation they've found themselves in). However, it is well shot and equally well-acted. Wilson has two on-screen children and, as we all know, having kids in prominent roles can sometimes be a little tiring to watch if they can't live up to the film they've been cast in.But it all works well. It's no mega classic, but if you're in the mood for something dark and depressing (plus a fun performance from the ever-reliable Brosnan) then give this one a go – it's well-acted, tense and dramatic enough to warrant just over an hour and a half of your time.",No Escape
33,dromasca,running scared,7,8 September 2021,"It is impossible to comment on 'No Escape', the action film made in 2015 by John Erick Dowdle and written by him with his brother Drew, without thinking about international events in the news. An American family finds itself in the worst possible place at the worst possible time - in a foreign overseas country where a change of political regime has taken place and the lives of all foreigners are in danger. Communications are no longer working, the American embassy has been evacuated or occupied by the rebels, and the family has to make its way to freedom, at all price. The chosen path, in fact the only possible one, is violent, and the result is an action film in which things happen and are resolved as in Hollywood movies, but which also has current resonances and a political substratum.'No Escape' succeeds because the screenwriters and the director have followed one of the rules that in some cases turn action movies into good cinema: they have created a gallery of characters whose fates viewers care about and can identify with, who go through credible experiences. The middle-class American couple played by Owen Wilson (in a dramatic role, very different from most of those played by the actor in other movies) and Lake Bell live with their two little girls an absolute nightmare, turning into a few hours from ordinary people living the experience of traveling to an exotic country in people running scared, fleeing murderous mobs in order to save their lives. Explicit violence and especially the use of children in the scenes where the two girls go through scaring experiences could be debatable, but director John Erick Dowdle managed in my opinion to create a perfect balance that makes the film captivating as an action film (there were scenes in which I literally sat on the edge of the chair) without slipping into manipulative extremes.There is a third important character in the film, whose presence has a dual role - to save the American family in moments of action when everything seems lost and to make the connection between what we see on screen and the geopolitical reality of Indochina where the action is located (the film avoids naming the country exactly, and some details of the location are problematic). Pierce Brosnan's fans will be pleased to meet him in the role of an aging James Bond, who thinks and speaks like John le Carre's spies.

The first Act verily defines the term ""bad choice"" and days after you leave the theatre you will still be thankful that no bad decision you ever made in your entire life was as bad as this one.The second Act is perfect. It explodes in real time. It mesmerizes. It hooks the viewer. The term nail-biting suspense does not even come close.The third act is a letdown, the writers perhaps went too far too fast and the story is hard to close. But while it lasts the ride is spectacular.Notes: * Wilson known for romcoms and comedies is excellent, handles this change of pace well * the single scene where Wilson's character has to throw his child like a Lacrosse ball will stay with you * Brosnan as a tired rake with espionage connections rings true * the only sour note is the climax where the Vietnamese border officials challenge a mystery boat ...

37,851222,"Amazing ""old school"" thriller",9,3 November 2015,"Greetings from Lithuania.Sometimes less is better. That is the case with ""No Escape"" (2015), an extremely simple story like 2x2, but what we got here is one of the most intense thrillers i saw in a while. And not that James Bond can safe the day this time.""No Escape"" is amazing thriller that glues you to the screen from beginning till the end. This is a bit of a low budget thriller, with well know faces in a bit unusual for them roles. Owen Wilson stars as a father who has to run for his life with his family after ""shix"" hits the fan in some ""4 wold country"". There aren't much of explanation in the beginning of what exactly caused the massive and man-killing riots, but we figure it out along the way. The settings are good, but a bit of a low budget. But intensity of action from a get go compensates everything - you never know when something will start happening in here, it's just a sudden and unstoppable gang tries to murder you in daylight and everything is about the survivor - here and now. Overall, ""No Escape"" is like a great throwback to thriller where it wasn't much about a plot but about the thrills theme self and not about high concept plot. As long as this counts, ""No Escape"" is a big and pleasant surprise that will definitely leave you on the edge of your seat during the whole run time. This is a great thriller, and one of the very best of it's genre in 2015.",No Escape
38,atlasmb,Night of Fears,8,13 December 2015,"Hitchcock, the master of suspense, often filmed stories about common men who are thrust into dangerous circumstances. He knew how to make his audience identify with the character and with his harrowing circumstances.With ""No Escape"", the Dowdle brothers have used that blueprint to create a film that is extremely suspenseful. Owen Wilson plays Jack Dwyer, a corporate cog who moves his family to Southeast Asia, where he finds himself in dire circumstances.Jack (and his family) is a fish out of water. The narrative emphasizes his inability to read or speak the local language, the severe cultural differences, the inscrutable nature (to him) of the people and their society. The story introduces the subtle fear of what is strange.On a morning foray to obtain an English newspaper, Jack suddenly finds himself trapped in a police action, with no idea who the combatants are or why they are fighting. This brings into play the fear of the unknown.As the action ratchets up and the danger increases, the story adds layer on layer of fear (e.g. fear of heights and fear of the dark) to increase the level of suspense as Jack struggles to save his wife, Annie (Lake Bell), and their two daughters.The acting is terrific. The two children hold their own in this emotion-packed film. Pierce Brosnan plays an English-speaking gent of questionable character, who is an ally by default because he knows how to negotiate the tourist traps and the local customs. His weary, rough-edged matter-of-factness is a role that Brosnan plays well.This film is intense and includes scenes that explore the baser aspects of human nature. If you can handle a Sam Peckinpah film, you can handle ""No Escape"".",No Escape
39,ironhorse_iv,"This Coup d'état movie can't escape, my thoughts. It had potential to be good. However, it turn out to be a bit mediocre.",7,4 November 2015,"This political thriller written and directed by John Erick Dowdle is indeed action packed. I love the sense of vulnerability, peril and intensity, that the overthrow plot pose for the struggling American businessman Jack Dwyer (Owen Wilson) & his family. It remind me, so much of 2008's Burma VJ, in the way, it was filmed. The unstable cinematography, meant to simulate chaos with lots of shaking was mostly alright for me. However, the over-used of slow-moment was a bit too much. It didn't seem warrant. Nonetheless, the strong violence in this film is really disturbing and intense as it comes. It's edge of your seat, worth it. I love, the fish out of water concept. I like how they are stuck in an unnamed foreign country, that going through its own domestic political turmoil. It adds to the mystery and the dangers. However, I dislike, how vague that unnamed Asian foreign country is. Despite being filmed in Thailand, even minority characters, within the film, are just mention as Asians and spoke in a mixer of several languages. I can understand that no country wanted to associate with the movie that portrayed its setting in such a poor light, however, it's a really needed key to story-telling that this movie clearly didn't have the balls for. I guess the movie chicken out on, insulting a real-life country, so, they made up, a country, in which the movie can be settled in. Nevertheless, I think this lame attempt of being Political Correctness, somewhat backlash on them. Since, the movie didn't have the balls to set the uprising events in a real-life country. They mostly affronted a lot more Asian countries with the film's ugly xenophobia approach, than just settling on just one. The movie was still banned in Cambodia & other Asian countries for its uprising government and semi-Yellow Peril message, anyways. So, at least, they could had, done, was have the film settling be in Cambodia like they originally wanted to. One thing, I wish, they did, was get a better ensemble cast; because this film cast wasn't that good. Don't get me wrong, It's nice to see Owen Wilson plays against type in a rare dramatic role, but Pierce Brosnan's semi-character, Hammond is far, more interesting with his alcohol/stripper fuel, personality. I love his relationship with the over-the-top, comical uber country-fan, side-kick, 'Kenny Roger' (Sahajak Boonthanakit). The only thing, that I didn't like Brosnan's character, was how much, backstory that man was missing. I guess, he's supposed to be, an economic hit-man, or something, but the movie never makes it, very clear. His overall badassery really comes out of nowhere. The themes of corporatocracy are also really laziness explained, here. It felt like a throw-away line. His role in the film was way too short. Sadly, the rest of the cast wasn't in his level. Lake Bell as Jack Dwyer's wife, Annie was really bland. She really doesn't have much of a character, so I really didn't get, anything good from her performance. I really hate, how dumb and stubborn, her character was written. She really has nothing to bring to the table, but trouble. The scene in the garden is a good example of this. Still, she's not the worst characters in the film. That honor goes to Dwyer's children, Lucy (Sterling Jerins) & Beeze (Claire Geare). Gees, everything about them, were annoying as hell. I really didn't like, any of the dialogue, they were force-fed. It made, the movie seem so unrealistic, when the kids are asking for food, dogs, and good night story, during a gun-fight. It also doesn't help that the characters are stuck with bad storytelling, including unlikely currents, logic, and forced incidents. Without spoiling the movie too much, I really don't buy, how stupidly lucky, these people got. I really didn't like, how the movie ends, with the Communism Vietnamese looking like good guys in all this. It was a bit jarring to say. After all, these are the same people that also had a coup, and kill a lot of foreigners, not so long ago. Overall: This movie is watchable. However, it's not good enough to be 2012's Argo memorable. I think this movie could have been better and I kinda wish, it was.",No Escape
40,Reno-Rangan,"In the ocean of orcas, a family of four penguins seeks a way out.",8,4 January 2016,"It was one of those movies I've lost interest after seeing its trailer. When I decided to watch I had no expectations, but I liked the surprise it gave me. So much better and very entertaining with lots of nail biting momentum. You can't write a review for this without mentioning the terrace scene which was one of the highlights of the movie.Remember the 2013 flick 'The Impossible' about a western family while visiting Thailand for a holiday stranded and separated after tsunami struck. Feels like this one is kind of a sequel, because of the similarity and takes place in a neighbouring country, Cambodia. But here the visiting family has to face the threat posed by the men from and during the coup.Ups and downs in the acting career are very normal and keeping that pace is essential. Right now Owen Wilson is maintaining it well and a few 2016 releases are the most anticipated ones. Pierce Brosnan's decent limited appearance had a prominent part of the storytelling. Comparing recent wonderful movies, Lake Bell carried out phenomenal stage of her career.I thought it would be old fashioned like the 80s and 90s flicks about people trapped in a local conflict. If you are yet to watch it, I'll clear your doubt that it is the same old theme, but amazes you with many thrill scenes. So this movie is very enjoyable and you would have a good time. Not recommended unless if you're not looking for a masterpiece.7/10",No Escape

42,Floated2,Lack of thrills,4,11 September 2018,"No Escape is a 2015 release thriller drama starring Owen Wilson. The film was an independent release with supposedly a budget of $5 million making $54 million worldwide. No Escape is quite generic and bland and lacking of thrills. Everything we witness is quite predicable. There are some decent moments but in general, we know that Owen Wilson's character and his family are never in any real danger and they will escape what ever comes their path.Pierce Brosnan steals the show with his few scenes, playing a helpful and undercover spy seeking help for Wilson. Had they added a few twists the film could have been elevated much more. No Escape reminded somewhat of World War Z (minus the zombies) in a way where an American family is running for their lives. The current IMDB rating of 6.8 is quite high and surprising that many audiences seem to have enjoyed this film. It is decent at best, nothing more than a time killing R-rated family action thriller.",No Escape
43,leonblackwood,Full of tension but slightly predictable! 5/10,5,18 January 2016,"Review: This movie is full of intense drama/action and I liked Brosnan's character, even though he's not really in it but it's a decent film with some brutal scenes. It is slightly predictable and the ending was a bit corny but it's still watchable. At the beginning of the film, an Cambodian prime minister is assassinated by rebels after a business deal with a foreign businessman. 17 hours earlier, Jack Dwyer (Owen Wilson) takes his wife Annie (Lake Bell) and his two little girls Lucy (Sterling Jerins) and Beeze (Claire Geare), to Southeast Asia to start a career in an American company which specialises in water systems. On the plane journey, they get chatting with a British man called Hammond (Pierce Brosnan), who shares a cab with them to there hotel. After finding out that his hotel room has no TV or Internet, the following morning, Jack decides to leave the hotel to look for an American newspaper. He then finds himself in the middle of a riot between armed rebels and police in riot gear, so he makes his way back to the hotel, only to see a fellow American being executed so he tries his utmost, not to be spotted by the rebels. He witnesses people being killed in the hotel and he can see that the rebels are making there way through each floor, so he quickly gets to his room, only to find out that Lucy is in the swimming pool downstairs. Whilst rescuing Lucy, Annie struggles to protect Beeze by jamming the door and when Jack returns to there room, they start to make there way out of the hotel. Jack comes face to face with one of the rebels but he is saved by Hammond, who tells them to make there way to the roof, were most of the foreigners are protecting themselves against the rebels. They work out that the rebels are chanting ""Blood for Water"" and that they are hunting down the foreigners who work for American company that wants to control the water supply. They soon sight a helicopter which seems like it's coming to there rescue but it's being controlled by the rebels who gun down most of the foreigners. The rebels manage to get on the roof and they kill the surviving foreigners but Jack and his family manage to jump onto the next office building, which gets taken out by a tank. Jack and his family manage to hide in the office building while the rebels are brutally killing the survivors. The following day, Jack and Annie put on the dead rebels clothes and they steal a bike and make there way to the American embassy. On arrival, Jack sees that the rebels have killed all of the staff and he manages to escape from the rebels, who blow up the building. After spending the night in a shelter the rebels arrive at there whereabouts and they search the area for them. Jack sights a gun but while he is making his move to take it, Annie reveals herself to give Jack time to get it, only to find out that it's empty. The rebels go to rape Annie whilst beating up Jack, only to be saved by Hammond who takes down the rebels with his trustee companion. Hammond then takes them to a nearby brothel to hide and he tells Jack that he's secretly working for the British government, who help poor countries with the intention of taking over. That explains the anger of the rebels who have worked out what these companies are doing. The following day, Hammond plans to make it across the Vietnamese border with Jacks family but they come under fire by the rebels and Hammond sacrifices his life so Jack can get his family across the river. After trading a watch for a riverboat, Jack attempts to get the family across the border but the rebels catch Jack and Lucy comes out of hiding to save him. The rebels then force Lucy to shoot Jack but  Annie intervenes and kills the leader with a metal rod while Jack shoots the other rebels. They then paddle across the border, even though the Vietnamese border control is shouting at them to turn back and when they reach safe territory the patrol turn there guns on the rebels who are threatening to shoot Jack and his family. Whilst getting over the whole ordeal in hospital, Jack has his family around him and he tells Lucy the story about how she was born. A corny ending to a dramatic movie! Owen Wilson really does man up and protect his family throughout the movie but it did seem a bit unrealistic. With that aside, it's full of tension and nail biting situations which do make you wonder, what you would do is you was in that position. I did stick with the film because I wanted to see how it would pan out but you know from the beginning, that there going to make it to safety. Anyway, it's a watchable movie but once you know the outcome, I doubt that you'll watch it again. Watchable!Round-Up: Owen Wilson, 47, was a weird choice for this movie because he's usually connected to comedic roles but he did do a good job and he showed some true emotion throughout the film. His next three films, Zoolander 2, Bastards and Masterminds, are all comedies so he's getting back to his comfort zone, which he is known for. This is the first major release for John Erick Dowdle who also wrote this movie with his brother, Drew. It's a well put together movie which is quite entertaining in places but I would have liked to have seen more from Pierce Brosnan's character, who was the best thing in the film.Budget: $5million Worldwide Gross: $54.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/thrillers starring Owen Wilson, Lake Bell and Pierce Brosnan. 5/10",No Escape

45,matthewssilverhammer,Lesser Version of Movies You Love,2,4 September 2015,"Some movies' failures are noble. Maybe their ambitions exceed their reach; they strive for uniqueness but lose their identity along the way. No Escape is the opposite; much of its failures come from it being utterly familiar. It's like a bad Xerox of so many other more successful thrillers: it's Captain Phillips without the writing chops or strong social awareness; it's San Andreas without the entertainment spectacle or needed humor; it's Die Hard without the skill or fun. This pandering and manipulative rip-off is a dour, dull, joyless and miserable experience that I wish had an earlier escape. No Escape takes-off as an ultra-bland 90s-thriller throwback, down to even the font of the title card. Once it gets going, the Paul-Greengrass-eque shaky cam takes over and eventually leads the movie from boring to just plain bad. The emotional manipulation through faulty slow motion and shameful use of scared children is unforgivable, only matched by the awful characters. Each are only pawns for horrifying things to happen to. Brosnan, a paradigm of lazy storytelling, is less a person and more a predictable and lazy screen writing tool. With clearly no real thought or effort put into him, he basically serves as a walking, coincidental miracle. Only a few aspects actually work. Wilson and Bell are both more than capable, and are clearly trying their best bring humanity to the terror. Also, the big Hollywood-based score with flourishes of its setting's culture is actually pretty great. Unfortunately, it's all stuck in an otherwise xenophobic and bland bag of cinema popcorn, leaving any positives lost under one of the worst films of 2015.",No Escape
46,paul-allaer,Much better than the movie critics would have you believe,8,2 September 2015,"As ""No Escape"" (2015 release; 103 min.) open, we see a high level meeting taking place (drinks are tested for poison before consumption). It's the Prime Minister (of an unnamed country), and before we know it, the Prime Minister is murdered. The movie then switches to ""17 Hours Earlier"", as we get to know the Dwyer family as they are en route to Southeast Asia: Jack (played by Owen Wilson), Annie (played by Lake Bell), and their two young daughters Lucy and Beeze. During the flight they also meet Hammond (played by Pierce Brosnan), who has visited the country 15 times and knows the place inside out. Upon arrival at their hotel, Annie comments ""Welcome to the fourth world!"", as there is no functioning TV, phone or internet. The next morning Jack goes for a walk to by a US newspaper, and inadvertently gets mixed up in a stand-off between demonstrators and police in riot gear. At this point, we are not yet 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this movie has gotten pretty negative reviews from the experts and movie critics. Well, let me tell you, they are way off the mark on this one. If you have seen the movie's trailer, you already know that this is in essence one long escape movie 9very similar in the way that the new Mad Max movie was in essence one long car chase). Once Jack gets mixed up in the stand-off, he and then his family in essence run and hide, and run some more, in a city where there is no sanctuary. It makes for an incredibly tense movie. It must also be mentioned that the movie is at times outright brutal, making for some difficult watching. This is definitely not a movie for the faint of heart. But there are also a number of heart-stopping scenes that play out brilliantly. The hotel rooftop scene, which is so reminiscent of the last days of Saigon 1975, will blow you away. Let me also point out a minus: much of the movie is shot with hand-held cameras and there are tons of close-ups (enforcing the feeling of anxiety), which frankly makes for some exhausting watching. Also, I'm still not 'buying' into Owen Wilson as an action movie guy. On the other hand, Lake Bell, who shone a few years ago in her own movie ""In A World..."", shines again in this one. Kudos also for Brosnan, who still has the charisma of his James Bond days. When you realize that the production budget of this movie was just $5 million, a pittance in today's Hollywood terms, this movie more than delivers the goods.""No Escape"" opened nationally this past weekend and due to the negative reviews I was hedging whether to go see this, even though I had liked the trailer. Well I gave in to my original curiosity. So glad I did. The early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay but not great (it was a week night, though). If you are in the mood for an ultra-tense action drama and you are not faint of heart, you should check this out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.

47,subxerogravity,Wow! An interesting and intense action adventure covered in drama.,7,28 August 2015,"I was not expecting much. Definitely was not expecting the action packed drama it turned out to be.Especially from Owen Wilson and Lake Bell, who look like such an ordinary couple from Austin Texas. it completely side swipes me.Wilson and Bell are the parental part of a family that includes two single digit girls who movie to Indonesia when daddy gets anew job at a water company, but the company's presence insures a rebellion that the family gets caught up in.it's a chase for pure survival as they spend a night avoiding getting killed. Weirdly similar to the Purge movies with more of a serious tone to realism that makes the chase touch you more profoundly.The sound effects were really good at enhancing the pain and the intensity of the whole chase. Every fall, every hit and every shoot made me cringe like I was feeling it myself.Pierce Brosnan once again gives a great performance as a seasoned action star, like he did in the November Man.It's not tour typical blockbuster but it should have been. it's hard to put this movie in a precise genre which is why it came out in such an odd time in the summer and I barely herd any advertisement on it, but its definitely worth the watch.",No Escape
48,PWNYCNY,"Lots of gratuitous violence, yet a strong story.",8,11 September 2015,"This movie is the latest of Hollywood's ongoing program of bashing foreign countries at the expense of Americans who once again are portrayed as hapless victims of mindless rage. This time the offending country is Thailand. (Yes, Thailand.) Why are the Thais, the land of lovely ladies, in such a tizzy? Well, without becoming a spoiler, let's just say that it is for a reason that is far-fetched and leave it at that. Yes, it's only a movie, and yes, there is something known as literary license, but still, they could have come up with a more plausible explanation. But, so what? It's still a good movie. Owen Wilson does a great job, showing his talent as a dramatic actor. True, an entire nation, which has been a staunch ally of the United States since the end of World War Two, is maligned and depicted as an enemy of the United States but such an unlikely scenario provides the background to heighten the story's intensity. Yet, rarely has an entire people been more thoroughly disparaged in a movie than the Thais. After watching this movie, one can reasonably wonder if the Thai people are a bunch of marauders who understand only one thing: violence. The nature of violence and mayhem perpetrated by the Thais in this movie is extreme. Throughout the entire movie mobs of Thai men are shown running amok. They are rampaging all over the place, burning, pillaging, raping, shooting, that is, committing all kind of heinous acts, even using tanks and helicopters as instruments of terror, driven by some vague grudge against a handful of hapless Americans who have no idea what is going on, which in that context makes the behavior of the Thais seem even more bizarre. Why a Hollywood movie would want to target Thailand for such an unsavory depiction is a matter for speculation. However, one thing is for certain: if you are an American thinking about traveling to Thailand, after watching this movie, you may want to think about changing your plans. If that seems far-fetched, watch the movie.",No Escape

You don't normally think of Owen Wilson as being in an action movie, or at least I don't, but he is really good here. He plays a family man with Lake as his wife and they have two young daughters. Owen is a water purification engineer from Austin, Texas that gets sent to a southeast Asian country-I don't remember an actual name for the country being mentioned-that borders Vietnam to start a new job. About 5 or 6 hours after they land and get settled into their hotel, the Prime Minister of the country is assassinated by rebels who then decide that any and all foreign devils in their country must be killed. Not good news for Owen & family. Luckily, they run into a British tourist, Pierce, and his Kenny Rogers loving associate, Sahajak, who try to help them survive. Owen & family must try to stay alive and then, just maybe escape-but there is no escape, according to the title of the movie- from the machete slinging and gun toting rebels with bloodshed on their minds. One thing I really liked was that they did not just turn Owen into an action hero like Vin Diesel or The Rock, although there is nothing wrong with those two fine action stars. Owen is just a normal man doing whatever he can to protect his family. The movie was shot in Thailand and written by John Erick Dowdle and his brother Drew. John also directed it. If their names are not familiar to you, they are responsible for As Above, So Below, Quarantine and Full Moon Rising.

50,alindsay-al,A good thriller that's hits the intensity,7,17 September 2015,"I like myself a good thriller so I was interested in seeing no escape and this film to my surprise was pretty good. The premise of this film sees an American family move to southern asia, where they get hunted by a group of rebels looking for revenge. Now Owen Wilson is a pretty good comedic actor but this is probably the best dramatic role he has ever done. His character was forced to become a hero even though he was a normal guy and he was very relatable for the audience. He brought some humour to the role and great dramatic moments. They give Owen Wilson a wife and two daughters and all of them are great in this film. They really added allot to the film and are used for huge dramatic moments that really bring the intensity. Pierce brosnan is really good in this movie even though he plays his usual role, I just wish there had been a little more of him. The story was pretty simple and that does mean sometimes there isn't enough meat in this film character wise. However, this film never stops moving And it really does the family aspect of the film well. The script has some okay humour and decent dramatic dialogue but sometimes you don't feel the weight of the situation like you should. The style was okay with the intensity of some scenes that really worked. However, there was an overuse of shaky cam and slow motion that take away from the action scenes.

OWEN WILSON gives the best performance of his entire career here & my personal favourite movie performance from any Actor EVER in Cinema History that's how OUTSTANDING WILSON is in his role of a good family man pushed to his limits of survival for his family, simply astonishing acting & so true because what would you do in his situation? Mesmerising performance.OWEN WILSON is OUTSTANDING.
LAKE BELL is OUTSTANDING.
PIERCE BROSNAN is OUTSTANDING.
OUTSTANDING acting & Casting, even the little girls are incredible little actors & the whole family unit is so believable.
Now gotta say that this film works so well because of Owen Wilson cast as the ordinary guy turned fighter to survive as we're used to his face on the front of silly-goofy Comedies but i much prefer him as a serious actor & he's really incredible given the opportunity like he did in Behind Enemy Lines (2001) & i prefer the older Wilson roles that he had back before he was known as a ""Comedy"" star like his parts in THE HAUNTING (1999) & ANACONDA (1997) & of Course, BEHIND ENEMY LINES (2001) this is the Wilson i grew up watching & loving & to be honest i got bored of all his silly Romantic Comedies that took up most of his Career!!! No Escape is the Owen Wilson i like back on Career best form with the best role & performance of his Career.WILSON is Fantastic as a panicky on the edge & terrified family man & he's great to watch you totally believe his performance TOTALLY, it's an energetic constantly stressed out & weary performance & WILSON nails it,he is so much better at this serious stuff that just silly comedy all the time!!! Like when WILSON done BEHIND ENEMY LINES way back in 2001 he was FANTASTIC then. No need to go into the story lots have.The atmosphere is very well done in this movie it has a constant sense of terror like something is about to happen any minute & as a family man myself with daughters i REALLY got into this & felt the terror that wilson feels when trying to get his family to safety in a war zone,it's real edge of the seat drama.Brosnan is also great in this as another good guy character caught up in this revolutionary chaos & gives an AWESOME performance. Lake Bell is also excellent as Wilson's wife & mother of his 2 daughters & she gives a great powerful performance.The south east Asia place this all happens in is a scary place,you can feel the dread building from the beginning & then bang a riot of revolution breaks out & slaughter begins & it's done so real & scary & like i keep mentioning OWEN WILSON gives a magnificent performance here & you are with him every single step of the way!!! A perfect cast & brilliantly directed this is truly a terrifying survival Thriller.
Also probably the best unexpected part of this Thriller is the excellent performance from the legendary PIERCE BROSNAN as a British Mercenary who is funny, charming & deadly & BROSNAN gives a brilliant performance & steals the show as he tries to save Wilson & his family & comes accross fearless in the extremely dangerous enemy territory that they trying to survive in. Brosnan is so good in this part & he makes you feel almost safe when he pops up to help & made me Nostalgic for how Great 90's Brosnan was back in his glory days with Classic's like DANTE'S PEAK, MRS.

I came here to pave the way for you.""""No Escape"" puts the spotlight back again on the undervalued discipline of dwarf-tossing. This favorite bar sport, as practiced by Aragorn in ""The Lord of the Rings"" (first in the mines of Moria, and then at the Battle of Helm's Deep), is also used here in the most nerve-provoking moment. Let me briefly mention that this film is definitely not suitable for heart patients and pregnant women. You can expect this movie to be extremely exciting. Up to a certain point that is. Because ultimately this film evolves into an implausible story. The number of desperate situations are shown one after the other in such a fast pace, that it feels like an ultra long survival film. The moments that the unfortunates were saved in the nick of time, are uncountable.The cover of the film immediately reveals which way this is going. It gives you the impression of being a cheap B-movie from the 80s. You might expect something different after noticing that Pierce Brosnan and Owen Wilson are playing in it. No way! It is and it remains an ordinary, mindless escape-movie. A type of movie with very exciting scenes and recurring situations where the imminent victims are saved out of their predicament at the very last moment.The only thing that made me curious for this movie, was how Wilson would handle a more serious role. He's known as an actor in funny (""Wedding Crashers"" for example) and less funny (""The internship"") comedies. Also joining corny tearjerkers (like ""Marley & Me"") is something he likes to do once and a while. So I wanted to know how this would end up. And surprisingly he did his job reasonably well. Besides some educational moments with Wilson relapsing into his familiar style, he still manages to play convincingly as the concerned father who'll do anything to save his family from a certain death. Even his prominent nose couldn't distract me (which is usually the case). On the other hand you have an actor like Pierce Brosnan, who frequently appeared in lame comedies (except ""A long way down"". I personally thought this was a successful film). And now he takes on the role of an secret agent once again. To be honest, this was the most exciting character although his appearance was a bit limited. And it wasn't really a big surprise when he showed up at the right moment.Eventually this is just a fairly superficial and not very innovative film. Take any zombie movie, replace the zombies with Asians and let it happen in a fictional country, you get something similar. And add two scared teenage daughters who have stupid requests at the wrong time over and over again. I don't think I would be nagging about being hungry when I was in such a life-threatening situation. There are also some absurd, ridiculous fragments in this film. Among other things, the moment Jack enters a conference hall where a meeting is in progress. Despite the threatening crowd outside the hotel, slaughtering innocent citizens mercilessly and attacking the hotel, the Asian participants calmly proceed in following the presentation. That was a little bit unlikely.It was to be expected that this film would cause some commotion in these particular regions. Because of its alleged political incorrectness and the tactless portrayal of the local population as primitive, bloodthirsty plundering barbarians. Apparently some Asians were offended by that. But that's the only fuss this film will make. The image of an average family that ends up in an extremely dangerous situation, is correct. But the image of the fearless hero who can guide them through it unscathed, doesn't fit Wilson. What remains is a ridiculous movie.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",No Escape
53,AudioFileZ,Unrelenting Tension Well Done,7,5 November 2015,"When you step away from the stable order of the developed world to help an undeveloped country you might not be a welcome guest. That's an understatement soon to be graphically expounded on No Escape. Owen Wilson, as engineer Jack Dwyer, takes his family to an unnamed South Asian country believing he is helping to give the population much needed clean water. In short order all Hell breaks loose due to an unknown coup just prior to Dwyer's arrival. All foreigners are definitely marked to be exterminated as angry mobs take to the streets. It's the kind of cleansing that is hard for westerners to admit is still possible because it's indiscriminate and encompasses anyone including women, children, as well as any native that might be helping - or just in the way. A bloodbath around every corner.This is one intense drama, perhaps more than any other film in memory. It's definitely the level of the palpable horror which raises the movie to a high. Remarkably when it starts it never lets up.The story isn't original,l or even without a few lapses of credibility, yet the constant fear factor is so high that the negatives becomes a non-issue. I give high marks for Owen Wilson's everyman in a impossibly dire situation strong performance. With much less screen time Pierce Brosnan, as British intelligence agent Hammond, steals just about any scene he's in. Brosnan's charismatic low-key humorous performance is like a special sauce that transforms a basic dish into the sublime. No Escape is a simply better whole than it has any right to be with these synergistic parts. If you like almost unbearable sustained tension the level achieved here is gut-wrenching. Definitely worth a watch and better than expected.",No Escape

55,Seraphion,Tense and emotional,7,13 September 2015,"The Dwyer family; Jack, Annie, and their daughters Lucy and Beeze move to a Southeast Asian country as Jack's company Cardiff offers him a position on a new plant there. They meet Hammond on the plane. On the airport Hammond, who's been there several times, has his local friend Kenny Roger drive them to the hotel. At the hotel they find barely anything works. The next morning Jack strolls out for a newspaper when he suddenly gets caught in the middle of a riot between. Jack runs for his life and sees rebels started killing locals and foreigners. At the hotel gate Jack sees a Cardiff executive gets executed. The mob spots him as he escapes up a fire escape. Jack finds Annie and Beeze. But Lucy has gone to the pool so Jack goes to find her. Jack finds Lucy and manages to get back to their room after escaping from rebels. They meet Hammond at the stairs, who tells them to hide on the roof. A helicopter flies above the roof. While the foreigners think it's a help, it instead belongs to the rebels and a rebel inside it starts firing at them. But it has its tail rotor tangled on some cables crashing it. The rebels storm through the roof access barricade ans starts killing everyone. Jack has Annie to jump to the next building's roof and then he throws Beeze at her. When he throws Lucy, the girls freaks out making them both almost fall. After Lucy gets thrown and Jack jumps himself the rebel leader signs that they know Jack's face. The family crawled one floor down and briefly rest as they hide. But the Jack spots a tank readying its muzzle at the building. After the tank's blast rebels pour in and kill everybody in the room but the family had hid in a room nearby. After all clears out a lone rebel spots the family and shouts to alerts his friends. But Jack hits him repeatedly shocking both him and Annie. As nightfall comes they sneak out and try to reach the US embassy. But the embassy proves a futile effort as Jack sees all the Americans dead and an explosion rocks the building. They then hides in a Buddhist shrine after pleading to the shrine keeper. Rebels storm in and push the keeper around. Jack goes for a rebel's gun but when Annie sees he's almost noticed, she springs out of hiding, drawing attention to her. She's about to get raped but Hammond and Kenny come and shoots the rebels dead. Hammond brings them to a safe place and tells Jack about the Vietnamese border down the river. Rebels storm in at them but Hammond manages to kill most of them, although Kenny gets killed and he gets wounded. He stays behind and covers the family's escape with his own life. The Dwyers reach the river and Jack trades his watch and shoes for a boat. But rebels catch up to them, pinning Jack down. Lucy goes for his dad but the rebel leader snatches her and forces her to shoot Jack, with a gun also pointed at her own head. Annie runs and beats the leader to death while Jack catches the gun and shoots the rest of the rebel group. The family then get in the boat and paddles to the border. The border guards spot them and orders them to stop. Jack pleads with them as more rebels come in. But the river current has the boat moved to Vietnamese waters and the guards threaten the rebels not to shoot, ending the family's ordeal.The background shows a different and slightly new perspective for a thriller start point. Bringing Southeast Asia as opposed to the common Middle East, Latin American or even African backgrounds really gave something fresh to the take. The story also did well in divulging the root cause of the problem as little as possible, enabling to focus more on the action of thriller, preventing it from turning into a political thriller.Focusing on family in premise of running from being killed is also good. It moves away from those solitary or even couples characters found in many thrillers. By incorporating this the movie has ample space to push in emotional load. This emotional load nicely covers what's missing on those action scenes which look less believable. The scene where Jack throws Beeze and Lucy will feel very weird if it didn't have any emotional load from the family viewpoint.The action scenes with pure action only comes as short bits. This is good as not to take away the focus from the thriller and stands as compliments to them. Yet they still feel a little awkward and soon get predictable because they only appear when Pierce Brosnan comes on- screen. It kind of puts the movie in a cliché as to the audience thinking whenever the family gets really stuck, Hammond will come bursting out of nowhere and save them.The acting overall is quite good. It's a very good take for both Owen Wilson and Lake Bell. They both have sunk to their own respective comedy roles for quite some time that some people in the audience gets surprised that they can do non-comedy roles. I remembered Wilson's role as quite engaging in ""Behind Enemy Lines"" and Lake Bell had one of her first roles in ""Pride and Glory"". And their dramatic take here is actually quite good. Together with the kids they can invoke the emotional family relationship in the suspense scenes. Pierce Brosnan's role was a nice nuance to the movie as a whole.A score of 7 out of 10 is from me for No Escape (2015), and a solid recommendation to go see it in the movies. It's very entertaining, especially for those of you who look for a new take on thrillers but still demand the high intensity mood in it.",No Escape

This is fair warning to ""escape"" watching this mess while you can. Not worth your time...I used fast-forward greatly. Anyone whose traveled internationally knows that unless you're a complete imbecile, you research where you're going as well as the people and customs of the land. Here we're supposed to believe that an engineer/businessman would haul his whole family over to Thailand unwittingly during a government coup. About 25 min of runtime in subsequent to introductions, the movie spirals out of logic. At least a dozen scenes are completely ridiculous. There's the helicopter crashing right ontop of them, bullets flying everywhere but hitting them, and my personal favorite Wilson character actually throwing his daughters across 10 story rooftops.

As much as the film puts the two daughters in danger (by, among other things, by throwing them across the rooftops) perhaps they thought comedy might be necessary, to keep audiences' attention? Although, the idea that this group of 15 - 20 men could take over the entire country, which appears to have only a few dozen residents, including the embassy, is almost comedic, in and of itself.

59,moviexclusive,"There are some nice action sequences in this movie, but they are probably not enough to save it from mediocrity",6,26 August 2015,"Nope, there will never be world peace. And movies like this thriller directed by John Erick Dowdle (Quarantine, Devil) are not really helping. This is not a bad thing though, considering the global mess that's happening outside our safe and sanitised homes. There is, to a certain extent, some truth in every other seemingly B grade action movie exploring the themes of international unrest.The story penned by the director and his brother Drew Dowdle sees an American businessman moving to an unnamed country in Southeast Asia(nice try, film producers, for attempting not to anger any of our regional neighbours) and finding themselves in the middle of a coup. From there, you see the family of four frantically trying to escape (there are lots of running, sweating and hiding) the violence and bloodshed that's around them.The first thing you'd be concern about is the casting of Asians as the supposed villains in the 103 minute movie. Yup, Asians are conveniently depicted as the evil ""others"", wielding their guns and choppers, going around killing innocent victims. Countless people die, but as you can probably expect, not the white family viewers are supposed to root for.One thing you may eventually realise though (if you haven't either completely shut off or immersing yourself in the action), is how every member of the global community has a part to play to reach this messy stage where unrest lurks in every corner of our world.There is lots of collateral damage in the movie. You see buildings collapse, explosions going off and almost everything in sight breaking apart. If you're looking for a movie with in depth character study, you may want to look elsewhere.Hence, as a popcorn flick, this movie doesn't fare too bad. Funnyman Owen Wilson (yup, an odd choice as the leading man in an action movie) does a decent job – you almost emphatise with him for having to go through what looks like a very strenuous shoot. He is paired up with LakeBell, who portrays a foreigner out of her comfort zone pretty well. And then there are the two child actors to tug at your heartstrings. Completing the picture is Pierce Brosnan, who reminds you how the years haven't been kind to the suave actor who made countless females swoon with his rendition of James Bond.The action sequences in the movie are nicely paced – watch out for a scene where Wilsonhas to bring his family to an adjacent building by convincing his wife that she can jump across the rooftop, and brace yourself for this: flinging his children across to the other side. While you may think to yourself ""yah right"", but you have to admit there won't be any casualties or things will end up looking pretty ugly.We are guessing this movie won't go down too well with critics, and probably won't have much box office impact.

61,quincytheodore,"Banged up abroad: Hide your wife, hide your kids",6,8 September 2015,"The best appeal from No Escape is not the anarchic story, return of Owen Wilson to action genre or typical underlying hidden agenda, but the intensely involving atmosphere. The feeling of riot is easily translated on-screen with fast editing and presentable family. Its perilous journey of survival is gripping and while it does have a few problems at latter half, it does enough for an enjoyable thriller.Owen Wilson plays as Jack, a father and husband who must relocate his entire family to an exotic country for his new job. Unfortunately for him, the moment he touches down on said country a widespread unrest happens. Angry local mob decides to kill foreigner for alleged economy monopoly, not the kind of activity you'd find on tourist pamphlet, and Jack now must use his wit and lots of luck to save himself and his family.Visual is its greatest strength. It has just the right touch of realism from the setting and over-the-top sequences for dire situation. For most of the time camera follows Jack very closely, almost as in documentary perspective but still manages to find the dramatic angles when needs be. It's a great vehicle to create suspense and it has just enough steam to be engaging until the end.Jack's family of his wife and two little girls is definitely a decent on-screen characters. It plays the right scenes to tug sympathy from audience. When the moment these girls whimper plays, though the acting or material doesn't hit the realistic effect intended, might even be slightly cheap, it remains a palpable plot device.The latter half fares slightly worse than its high octane opening. There are just too many Deus Ex Machina moments when stuff explodes or help comes at the nick of time to be believable. Furthermore, the propaganda agenda feels like it's shoehorned in, mainly to introduce Pierce Brosnan's character. The backstory of the danger itself is far from fully fleshed out.It may feel implausible at times, but the pleasant details of the setting and presentation of the turmoil makes No Escape into a delightful action survival.",No Escape

A fantastic movie about an American expat family trapped in an unnamed South East Asian country after a civil war had broke out; fighting for survival and a way out of the war torn country. Owen Wilson's should be given credit for acting in roles that are out of his typecast. Wilson's acting really shines in this movie. While Brosnan played a convincing Blackops operative that indirectly fueled the fire to a revolution/coup. I would recommend anyone to watch it at least once... I would greenlight a prequel to the backstory of Hammond (Brosnan's character) if given the opportunity because it would be an amazing movie. Even a spinoff sequel focusing on the other expats trapped in that same country would be watch worthy.,No Escape
63,Screen_Blitz,"Edge of your seat suspense is here, but the sharp lack of substance make it difficult to recommend",4,25 February 2016,"This action thriller directed by John Erick Dowdle, stars Owen Wilson who breaks his comedic typecasting in the role of Jack Dwyer, a devoted husband and father who moves his wife Annie (played by Lake Bell) and their two young daughters Lucy and Beeze (played by Sterling Jerins and Claire Geare) to Southeast Asia for a job offer, in an unnamed country which appears to be Thailand. Upon their arrival, the city is without power and the streets are left littered. The following morning, Jack makes a stop by the market where he encounters a violent rebellion with armed rebels gunning down civilians and authority officers. In the midst of the chaos, Jack rushes back to the hotel and snatches his family and leads them in an intense fight for survival against the rebels as they desperately try to escape the mayhem that runs amok across town, and are later joined by British tourist Hammond (played by Pierce Brosnan) who assists them on their escape.With the normally comedic actor Owen Wilson taking on a dramatic role, I really did not know what to expect from this picture. Fortunately, his portrayal in this role manages to stand out from most of the film's mediocrity. From the opening scene, the film begins with a promise and we are introduced to some very likable characters including Owen Wilson's character and his family who is very caring to, and Pierce Brosnan's character who is friendly on arrival. But it's not until the opening minutes of the Asian rebels launching an massacre on the city when the plot finally kicks in. At this point, we are pulled into an intense violent bloodbath with adrenaline-fuels thrills and edge-of-your-seat action that succeed on setting the tone for the plot. This sequence does enough to leave your heart pumping and hoping for the characters' survival, but as the sequence progresses; it eventually becomes implausible and loses its authenticity. The characters' actions make the plot difficult to take seriously, so notably is the slow motion with Owen Wilson hurling his daughter across from a building to another building on the other side, which is a bit laughable and unrealistic in sense. Nearly every scene after wards is a bit over-the-top and results in the plot being less believable, and without a well thought out premise is support it, it simply doesn't work. What's the reason behind the violent massacre? What country is this trying to attack? Something that the film fails to explain, thus making the plot needlessly xenophobic than something to take seriously. The cast's performances were not bad the least bit, but do very little to redeem. And it doesn't help Pierce Brosnan who is sadly underused and given little to work with.No Escape is a thrill ride that sadly descends into a shortage of substance, and the result is a film that is quite difficult to recommend.

I had reached that point and was enjoying the film at that level when the first breathing point in the flight arrived, courtesy of Pierce Brosnan's character. Then he gave his little obligatory anti-western and anti-capitalist sermon, about how evil western companies come to third word countries, entice them, burden them with debt and then take over. This is actually a highly accurate description of what the Chinese Communists are doing around the world with their ""Belt and Road"" initiative.

Essentially, 80% of the movie is lotsa bad guys chasing four good guys, two of whom happen to be cute young kids. There is no secondary or sub plot. There are no cutaways to other people or other scenes. Nor is the reason for the demonstrations, coup, revolution (or whatever is happening) ever explained beyond the fact they don't like Americans very much.

68,RforFilm,"Unpleasant, stuck with zombie-like villains and an odd choice for a hero, No Escape is far from rescue",3,1 September 2015,"The Boy Scouts of America motto is and always has been, ""Be Prepared"". I thought that meant to be ready for anything, but what it really amounts to is to be prepared for what your about to go through. It can be a simple vacation, a marathon or an event that you know is going to be bad. While you can't be ready for everything, I tried my best to be ready for the unexpected. The only problem is that life seems to stay so much so the same, that it seems like that in the eyes of a witness, I'm wasting my time rather the preparing for anything. An economic breakdown or a zombie apocalypse would be a nice change of pace. Travel and moving are two things we prepare for, yet always come across something that's going to block our full enjoyment. It may be a bad hotel, an expected problem with the attraction your visiting, or it may even be the foreignness of the country your visiting. So far, the furthest I've traveled is Russia and while I had fun, I certainly felt out of place with the culture and the language barrier. Owen Wilson and his family face the ultimate culture shock in No Escape. Jack Dwyer (played by Owen Wilson) is flying to an unknown region of Southeast Asia with his wife Annie (played by Lake Bell) and two daughters Lucy and Beeze to start a new life and career as an engineer for an American water company with residence there. Upon arrival, they see how much tighter and claustrophobic the environment is (not to mention a hotter and more humid condition), but seem to be in good hands when they are given a ride to the hotel by a British traveler Hammond (played by Pierce Brosnan) who reassures the family that their going to love the place.With no working television, phones and internet, Jack heads out the next morning for an American newspaper. Just as he's heading back to the hotel, he's caught in the middle of a stand between a riot squad and a rebellion group. He makes it through the melee, but sees that the uprising is happening all over the city, so he figures that he needs to get his family to the American embassy. That going to prove to be more difficult then he anticipated as it seems like that the rebels are killing all Americans and have control of the city. I'll give No Escape credit that the idea of Americans caught in a political uprising in a foreign country is not a bad idea for a thriller. Perhaps if it went into more detail of the uprising and the turmoil that the country was facing along with a suitable action star, it could work. No Escape decided to take the ""unknown danger"" route by giving us vague information about the problem and even does not recognize the country. I guess they thought it would intensify the situation with the audience, but it comes off more like a Purge genocide. The enemy rebels look more like zombies out for blood then people wanting something better. I know a dumb crowd can be easily persuaded for the wrong, but I have a hard time believing that every rebel to be just as merciless as portrayed in the movie. The other problem lies on the main star Owen Wilson. I like this guy and believe he can be given plenty roles, however an action star he is not. He's a bit too much of an everyman to step into the role and his voice defiantly does not fit one of an action star. Sure he can believably be an engineer, but I see more of an Ewen McGregor or Gerald Butler that can fit the shoes of both rolesI'll give this three riot gears gears out of ten. No Escape's concept cannot escape bad villains and a bland hero. It also cannot escape a bad tone that makes the experience too unpleasant. I hope Owen Wilson takes this experience as a lesson that comedy may be his stronger suit then drama. Please escape this before it's too late.",No Escape

70,bob-the-movie-man,Tenser than a tuk-tuk ride at rush hour,8,9 September 2015,"""No Escape"" is set in an anonymous South East Asia country bordering Vietnam facing a violent civil war, with the uprising triggered by perceived foreign imperialist intervention. The film was shot in Thailand but looks and feels like Cambodia. Having had the fortune to spend time in Cambodia and be immersed in its troubling history, this feels well positioned: the economic premise at the heart of the film - that governments invest in loss-leading foreign-aid, in this case water treatment, to 'buy' future strings of the leadership - is controversial but has the ring of truth about it. Countries like Cambodia have been used as political footballs by the Super Powers for many years, and are pressure-cookers of injustice and discontent.Owen Wilson and Lake Bell play Jack and Annie Dwyer, parents relocating - reluctantly - to the country as ex-pats to follow Jack's work as a water treatment engineer for a US corporate. Pretty brave, as they have their two young children Lucy and Beeze in tow. With immaculate timing they fly in on the eve of the uprising and their life turns into a terrifying game of hide and seek as the armed rebels pursue then with one intent: murder with a side-order of rape.They are aided and abetted by a long-term ex-pat Hammond (Pierce Brosnan) who spends most of his free-time in bars and brothels but is a handy person to know. The film's title sums up the action perfectly: in a world without law, order or reason, and as scuppered as four chickens in a fox farm, how will the family survive? Or indeed will they all survive?The bottom line is that this film is tense. Very tense. On the 'tenseness scale', we go right through 'clenching the armrest' right up to 'hands in the hair' tense at times, and there is little relief from after the action really kicks off. As a result, this is quite an exhausting watch.The casting is also fascinating. Owen Wilson, better known for fluffier stuff like ""Wedding Crashers"", didn't feel to me like the natural choice for this lead, but he is really excellent. And Lake Bell, best known for the kooky and underrated 'voiceover' film ""In a World"", also excels as the traumatized wife and mother. Together with some highly credible performances by the kids (Sterling Jerins and Claire Geare) the ensemble really makes you care for the family unit, which adds massively to the tension.Also in his best role for years Pierce Brosnan has great fun as the animated larger-than-life Hammond, although those of a sensitive musical disposition should be aware that he does sing again in karaoke mode: and if this were possible, it's even more toe-curlingly awful than ""SOS"" (albeit intentionally so). The one criticism would be Brosnan's weird accent which at first I took to be South African, but it later emerges that he is supposed to be British. If so, it's no UK regional accent that I recognize.We are into September now - a difficult period for cinema, where the summer blockbusters give way to those films the studios deem not quite good enough for the 'Oscar period'. But, whilst having the feeling of a tight and relatively low-budget flick, here is an action film worthy of your attention. It is a film that tells a simple story very well, choosing to cut away from the more gruesome acts (it is a '15' certificate in the UK) to focus on the players' reactions and leaving more to the imagination. For this, the director - John Erick Dowdle (who also wrote the piece) - is to be congratulated. I was rather sniffy about his last film (""As Above, So Below"") - ""No Escape"" is a vast improvement.In summary, taut, tense and worthy of your movie dollar. Note though that for those adversely affected by films about children in peril and/or about serious sexual assault, this might be one for you to miss.(If you enjoyed this review, please register at bob-the-movie-man.com for future posts.

In it, an against type Owen Wilson portrays a husband and father who has to move his family to a never named Asian country for work, on the eve of a massive political coo where rebels are killing Americans in the streets. The whole movie is simply about Wilson trying to get his wife and two daughters safely out of the country, which is no easy task. Dowdle really portrays everything in a very realistic fashion that has you gripping your arm rests the entire length of the film. It's the fact that things like this are actually happening out in the world now, that makes this perhaps the most terrifying movie I have seen in a long time. With that said, it is an exceptional film that should be seen if you feel your nerves can take it, because it's a great drama about a man who will protect his family at all costs.I give No Escape a 9 out of 10!",No Escape
73,nathanmanson,Was way too unrealistic for my liking,5,11 May 2020,I find it hard to believe they'd be able to over run the police as easy as they did. Also I fail to believe the Thai people would be so persistent in killing all the foreigners. Just doesn't really make sense in my opinion.,No Escape
74,dfa120374,A Very Enjoyable Action/Thriller,7,19 February 2016,"OK let me just start off by saying that if you want a movie with a deep, multi-layered, complex story then No Escape is not for you. The people moaning about the story not being any of these things need a bit of a reality check when it comes to movies like this as typically the story usually is basic or thin. Or both. This is an Action/Thriller...not an epic period Drama. That doesn't mean to say there ISN'T a story here, though, and it's not as if it's just mindless action from start to finish, but to expect anything more is a wee bit naive.Anyway, now that wee gripe is off my chest, onto the film.I actually thought No Escape was an extremely enjoyable Action/Thriller, and there is definitely plenty of both action & thrills throughout the film. You can also throw a good deal of suspense in to boot. When it all kicks off, the action & suspense is pretty relentless with there being only a few ""catch your breath"" moments. Don't get me wrong...the action's obviously not a Mad Max type of relentless, but it does get your adrenaline flowing. Mix that with really good tension and you have some good starter ingredients for a really good movie.I thought the cast all done a very good job as well, especially Owen Wilson. He's not generally a person you would immediately think of when it comes to a film like this, but he nails it with a great performance. His last action role was in Behind Enemy Lines which was another excellent movie, so maybe he should take on more of these types of roles. The only real thing I didn't like was Pierce Brosnan's London accent. It wasn't the best and while his performance was OK, the accent just threw me off slightly. But it was a minor thing in an otherwise entertaining film.I'd definitely recommend giving this film a watch, especially if you enjoy a good Action/Thriller, and as long as you don't expect an overly in-depth story, then you should enjoy it as much as I did.",No Escape
75,Rickting,A suspenseful and underrated thriller,7,16 August 2016,"No Escape follows an American family trapped in an unidentified Asian country during a violent coup, where foreigners are being executed. This came and went with little fanfare, but how solid this movie actually is was a pleasant surprise. It's certainly not perfect though. The depiction of the Asians in the film is somewhat questionable, while the revolution is not only highly unrealistic and exaggerated, but the reason behind it is fairly silly. Pierce Brosnan plays the movie's best character but isn't given enough screen-time. The film as a whole feels a bit rushed and underdeveloped, especially in terms of its characters. However, thanks to the film placing a likable family as the main characters, the hand-held camera-work and multiple suspenseful and occasionally terrifying scenes, this is a really nail-biting thriller. It's consistently tense and frightening, surprisingly well-directed and even has a bit of social commentary to support it. NE is a very scary and exciting film, despite some xenophobic undertones and unintentionally funny slow-motion scenes, and it's definitely worth checking out. 7/10",No Escape
76,Aylmer,Shark-jumping opportunity misser nonetheless offers many solid thrilling moments,5,2 September 2015,"There are certainly many things this film has in common with Owen Wilson's other ""serious"" action movie BEHIND ENEMY LINES, with him as a fish out of water in a hostile foreign country just trying to get to safety and gradually being pushed more and more into action hero territory as the film goes on. This film is a little different in that Wilson is just a totally average employee and having to protect his wife and two young daughters. The selling point for a suspense-based film like this is realism, which the makers excellently set up in the first half but completely lose gradually as the film goes on due to some utterly head-scratching decisions...* Wilson barely manages to get back to his hotel room in time to warn his family but has to go back for his oldest daughter swimming in the downstairs pool, leaving his wife to hold down the hotel. Some rebels butcher the family across the way from her in a very effectively tense scene and she bars the door with her body. For some reason, the rebels just give up on breaking down the door? Okay, maybe they were tired... let's go on to the next one.* Wilson's family is holding out on the roof of the hotel with many other families when a chopper shows up only to open fire on them. Miraculously, Wilson's family (kids and all) are the only ones smart enough to survive not only a chopper crashing and exploding on top of them, but the rebels storming the roof even though his daughters are kicking and screaming for many crucial minutes.* Brosnan and Kenny Rogers rescuing the family at the last minute. Why was Brosnan pointing to the roof as an escape when he never ended up there himself? How did he and Rogers find where the family was? Were they following them the whole time?* The Ending. What a disaster... for one thing there is no Southeast Asian capital city with direct US flights and within a couple hours canoing distance from Vietnam. Even if there was, why would the river not be jam-packed with other refugees?Despite this ridiculousness, the film offers some fascinating food for thought on what it would be like to happen to be a foreigner in a country as it falls apart. I'm sure it's happened to many people in such places as Libya, Cambodia, Liberia, Uganda, etc. The sheer level of fear, powerlessness, and awkwardness of such a scenario is successfully portrayed here, but unfortunately squandered by many points in which the filmmakers dumbed things down to focus on overdone and predictable, logic-defying clichés.I have to point out that there's many points of undeniably well-handled tension including a wonderful scene in which the family has to sneak through a celebration parade. There's a lot of promise throughout the film actually and moments of real humanity that shine through, but this scene constitutes the last of it. Much of the action and violence that stir up in the last third of the film loses its impact due to an increasing reliance on shaky-cam cinematography as the film progresses. Someone really needs to end this nuisance of a filmmaking practice as it really is just sloppy and has killed almost every action film since 1998. It just takes me right out of the movie.I'm glad I saw this movie but can't help but wonder how much greater it could have been had it been made a little more KILLING FIELDS and a little less WORLD WAR Z.",No Escape
77,DareDevilKid,"Tense, Exciting, Unsettling, and Totally Unexpected",8,19 December 2015,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.9/5 starsOne of the strongest action thrillers in recent years, this gripping movie cleverly casts actors known for comedy in central roles. And it works well, and then some. But the real reason this film is so effective lies in its script, which never dumbs it down for the audience. Instead, it cleverly leaves out irrelevant details, keeping viewers guessing about essentially unimportant elements while getting on with the frantic mayhem.""No Escape"" opens as Jack and Annie (Owen Wilson and Lake Bell) fly to Southeast Asia (which country, we're never told) with their daughters (Sterling Jerins and Claire Geare) to start a new life after Jack's business back home went under. He has a new job here helping provide drinking water. When they get to their hotel, after being given a lift by a friendly fellow traveler, they are impressed to see a large banner with Jack's photo on it, welcoming him and his fellow co-workers. Unfortunately that welcome will only last a few hours. What they don't know is that their plane lands at just about the same moment as an insurgency is about to strike and overthrow the greedy, western-affiliated government and then set it sights on interloping Westerners. So before they've recovered from jet lag, this family is running for its life. The only person who helps them is the disheveled Hammond (Pierce Brosnan), who's actually a shady British operative with a helpful local sidekick (Sahajak Boonthanakit) who loves Kenny Rogers. But the mob is on the warpath.Brutally violent, ""No Escape"" keeps you on the edge of your seat as Jack leads his family in an attempt to escape what appears to be an unmitigated attack by the local population to exterminate all expats. A political assassination has triggered a mob mentality and, be it guns, clubs, or a handy two-by-four, pretty much no one is safe from some kind of retribution. Wilson is probably the last person you'd expect to see as an action star, but here he lets the situation dictate his actions. He's as timid of violence as you or I but, when his family is threatened, he slowly becomes like the people he is running from. ""I killed somebody,"" he almost casually tells his wife, Annie. She can only nod, having also been taken to the brink in the fight to keep her family safe. Bell is also well cast, displaying an inner toughness we haven't seen in other films. As the mysterious ""friendly"" fellow traveler, Brosnan is cool as a cucumber, no matter what the situation.Once the film kicks off it never lets up, ratcheting up the tension quickly, and propelling these characters into a series of outrageous cliffhanging moments. Filled with blood, gunshots, and gruesome deaths it's startlingly violent for a film with a fragile young family at the center, which makes the peril feel all too real. Writer-Director brothers Drew and John Erik Dowdle do a terrific job at merging action movie clichés with gritty authenticity. Even though the story is not completely original, they know how to build up tension, giving us a very entertaining movie. The script may occasionally feel contrived, and you're not sure how plausible much of it is - the bit about the American embassy seems unlikely - but the suspense is often overwhelming (I found myself gripping my seat and holding my breath more than once.) thanks to astute direction and solid performances. Wilson and Bell are startlingly good and hold their own in the most fiercely life-threatening scenarios without ever turning into silly action heroes. Their family bond is believable, as is the hint of past tension between them, which adds a strong emotional undercurrent. By contrast, Brosnan seems to be enjoying the chaos; a salty veteran of much more dangerous missions.The film captures both the anger of those causing the disturbance as well as the fear and frustration of the Dwyers. The story moves quickly, and you're almost as breathless as those on the run when it ends. ""No Escape"" is an unexpected surprise that'll leave you breathless and on the edge of your seat.",No Escape
78,danielmanson,It's not too bad,6,8 May 2020,"Okay, I have to be honest and say that I was very reluctant to watch this because I didn't know how Owen Wilson would be in a serious role, but he did a pretty good job. The reason I gave this a 6 was for a few reasons.First was that I just didn't really care for the characters, that could be me having a stone heart, but there wasn't any depth on the family or anything so I had no connection to them.
I also found the premise quite annoying, I get the plot, but I couldn't get why basically the entire country is essentially hunting down people. So many scenes where they would be searching a random building or something. Just why, they raided all the hotels and killed off everyone, assuming this place isn't all touristy so why are they full on searching the country all the time. It was just something I couldn't get past.Acting I thought was pretty good from all involved, it had me on the edge of my seat at times and overall it's an okay watch. I think a 6/10 is fine, it's something to watch on a plane or a Sunday hangover.",No Escape
79,scottshak_111,A bad take on a chaotic situation,6,2 September 2015,"No Escape rushes in with a story that would scare any expat venturing into unknown borders. But has it been executed properly? The answer to that is a big No.John Erick Dowdle's movie covers a situation. It endeavours to answer the 'What if' when you move to an alien land where the entire mob is against you. More like a zombie apocalypse but with people.The movie is very predictable. You see almost everything coming. There is no subtlety in Dowdle's frames. The rabid crowd executes head-shots from miles away. The attackers have been portrayed as ruthless fanatics without a heart. They kill everyone not just the foreigners. So more like zombies. A little hard to believe there.SPOILERS AHEAD: Screenplay is also very poorly written. Pierce Brosnan has just a cameo and he barges in like an assist. His role ends in a jiffy.Lucy and Beeze are adorable, and they try to beam up things. But all of that happens in the beginning, when chaos hadn't started. Soon they get out shadowed, except for the occasional ""I want to go potty"" and ""I am hungry"" distractions. A lot of things in the movie are not highlighted properly. There is no proper aftermath to an emotional trauma.Bottom line: Not that great.",No Escape
80,disinterested_spectator,A Revolution Saves a Family,6,26 January 2016,"""No Escape"" is principally a fantasy film for husbands who are failures. A lot of men feel they have let their wives down, and in this movie, Jack Dwyer (Owen Wilson) has done so in a big way. From the dialogue we learn that he used to be in business for himself, but he eventually had to give that up. So, he takes a job with Cardiff, a water company, requiring that he relocate his family to some unnamed country, which would have to be either Laos or Cambodia, which means he and his family are strangers in a strange land, where they don't speak the language and where the food being sold in the marketplace would cause you to lose your appetite. They check into a hotel where the phone doesn't work, some of the lights don't come on, and there is nothing but snow on television. And this looks like the best hotel in the whole city. It all proves to be too much for Jack's wife Annie (Lake Bell), and in the middle of the night he finds her sitting on the floor of the bathroom crying. In other words, if things had proceeded normally from this point, this would have been a movie of misery, probably resulting in Annie's taking their two children back to the United States before long and filing for divorce.But then there is a coup, the prime minister is assassinated, everyone in the American embassy is killed, and the police are overrun by mobs of revolutionaries, whose ultimate goal is to slaughter every Caucasian foreigner in the country, especially employees of Cardiff. As horrible as that sounds, it gives Jack a chance to redeem himself, as he leads his family this way and that through one melodramatic situation after another, even to the point of killing a man who was threatening them, in full view of his wife. And she thought her husband was a failure. Hah!On the plane coming over, they met Hammond (Pierce Brosnan). Given Brosnan's James Bond persona, we are not surprised when he turns out to be a British spy. But he is not just a spy who is getting along in years. He is a corrupt version of James Bond. Now that the Cold War is over, his services are put to ends more pecuniary than patriotic. After coming to the rescue of Jack and his family, he confesses to being the ultimate cause of the revolution. His job is to get countries to borrow money for projects, such as waterworks, knowing that they will never be able to pay back the loans. Being hopelessly in debt, the countries have no choice but to let corporations like Cardiff come in and make big profits at the expense of the impoverished citizens. Normally, things work out well, and the citizens don't even realize how it all happened. But this time, things did not work out well, and so the people have risen up to take their country back. In other words, Hammond continues, they are trying to protect their families just as Jack is trying to protect his.That's cute. But Hammond's explanation of what is going on comes across as a little bit forced and artificial. Even if Hammond's explanation were true of how things work in the third world, his flippant attitude is not realistic. Most people try to justify what they are doing. A real life Hammond would have tried to say that he was ultimately helping the people of the country, and that the profits made by Cardiff were just one more way in which the free-enterprise system works for the greater good. But one gets the feeling that this more nuanced approach, which would have allowed us to gradually see through his self-deceiving justification, would have taken too much time. So, the scriptwriters had Hammond just blurt it all out with no apologies. We get a two-minute information dump, and that's that. Then it's back to kill or be killed.Speaking of which, the unrelenting obsession on the part of the revolutionaries to kill every Caucasian foreigner they can find seems to be a little much. And when the leader of a squad of these killers tries to force one of Jack's daughters to pull the trigger on a revolver and shoot Jack in the head, while holding a pistol to the head of that same daughter, he reminded me of some Snidely Whiplash character tying a girl to the railroad tracks.And then along came Jones. Or rather, along came Annie. You see, in times past, it was all right for the man to save the helpless woman, but that is no longer acceptable. And so, about halfway through the movie, Annie begins doing her share, even to the point of bashing the brains out of the guy trying to force her daughter to shoot Jack.Finally, as the ultimate irony, Annie rows a boat containing her family across a river to Vietnam, where they find sanctuary. From there, presumably, they will go back to the United States and stay there. And so, thanks to the revolution, they live happily ever after. Without that, Jack would have been a failure with a miserable wife on his way to a divorce.",No Escape
81,Alanjackd,Well worth a watch,4,9 September 2015,Well worth a visit to the cinema this.Some very good action sequences and very catchy edge of the seat direction. At one point I didn't think I could take any more ..my nerves were dangling.Not too dwelling on the political side either and does not dwell on too much character dialogue.I must say that Pierce Brosnan is absolutely fantastic in this and I feel he is gradually shaking off his Bond image.Only bad point was if they had toned down the assault and the violence ( we were aware of it throughout and didn't need to see it on screen ) I could have taken my 12 year old film mad daughter. This would have been a great chance to up her options to a bit more grown up movie.Basically a dam good strong thriller.with solid performances throughout.,No Escape
82,Coffee_in_the_Clink,An interesting Asian Exploitation film...,6,25 August 2020,"Very surprised to find Owen Wilson in the lead here. But that's not to say anything bad about him, on the contrary, I'm full of praise for him and this film. Because what I liked about ""No Escape"" was the apparent (some may call it ignorant) exploitative nature of it's filmmaking, with action that harks back to a Chuck Norris ""Missing in Action"" flick from the 1980s, and a theme, storyline that serves the staple for your grungy exploitation film. I am surprised there wasn't much backlash on a mainstream Hollywood film treating a South-East Asian populace as nothing more than a horde of blood-thirsty savages out to kill the white man. That, essentially, is what ""No Escape"" is. I enjoyed how the country, which was unnamed in order to avoid offence, is still depicted as bordering Vietnam! It's exploitation cinema at its best. Ignorant, you might say. But you could also, in it's defence, say it is a film about a man protecting his wife and children. But let's be honest ... It's just pure simple, unapologetic brainless enjoyment.",No Escape
83,troyputland,Gripping from Beginning to End,9,16 September 2015,"No Escape is a high-octane, off-the-edge-of-your-seat thriller. Jack Dwyer (Owen Wilson) moves his family to an unknown destination in South-East Asia for business purposes. A coup eventually breaks out, with locals targeting and killing foreigners. The Dwyer family, which includes Lake Bell as Jack's wife, must find safety if they're to survive this ordeal. It's a simple plot, but an effective one, constantly intense after the first 15 minutes. We're with them, routing for their safety. Even the kids, who're a little insufferable in the toughest of times. As enthralling as No Escape is, it does come with one inconsequential flaw: it's predictable. Although the suspense never wanes, and the family feel legitimately in danger. Owen Wilson and Lake Bell are incredible, staying rock solid for their kids. Pierce Brosnan's character tilts No Escape into the improbable, and the Dwyer sisters act as youngsters do when they're too young to know any better. Brushing that aside, No Escape is a beguiling and gripping film that's comfortably one of the most memorable of 2015.",No Escape
84,Brooklynsmagicmike,Don't let Owen Wilson being the lead of a thriller deter you. This was an awesome movie!,9,13 May 2020,I was pleasantly surprised by this film. When I first saw it pop on imdb I said Owen Wilson thriller? Keep in mind I am fan of him but I just find him to be to comical for this subject matter. But he did an excellent job along with the rest of the class.The movie does start bit slow but once it gets going its smooth sailing from there. For a movie without huge budget it does the best it can to make you feel at edge of your seat. Its truely a non-stop thrill ride.My only reason for docking star has to do with more of marketing team then the movie itself. Its listed as intense action/thriller but the action is very scarce. There was few times in it where I wanted Owen Wilson to just take off and turn into Bruce Willis die hard type but that diddn't happen.Overall this is still great movie and would heavily recommend to anyone.,No Escape
85,jmoneyjohal,"An entertaining action thriller, but the films not as realistic as it seems.",6,4 September 2015,"I entered the cinema hall to watch No Escape because of two reason the star cast which consisted of Owen Wilson who always acts well even in the worse of films, and because the film stared my favourite bond,Pierce Brosnan in a bond type role,I mean both actors are far from being A list actors anymore but still I was intrigued. Also the trailer was pretty good. I mean on paper the film seemed like another straight too DVD release.Moreover No Escape is a relentless film, without even knowing any back story within 15 min an action filled thriller is unveiled. While the action is top notch, the film being a human drama loses out any emotional connect because we hardly no anything about the character they are just running around without any baggage for the viewers. But nevertheless the action/drama thriller works because of fast paced narrative, you don't even get a chance to blink, its non stop action.Story wise the film starts of with the Prime Minister of a South Asian country being killed by rebel forces,so that rebel can take over the country. Around the same time Jack Dwyer, his wife, and two daughters enter the same country. Jack's back story is very briefly explained, that he left Texas because his former Water company, went under, so he is relocating to a new under developed country to join a Water company which is helping the under developed Asian country,to get proper clean water. The next day after his arrival the rebel forces start to take over the country killing everyone especially foreigners.Jack sees the threat and tries to Escape the country with his family.Does Jack and his family survive a Civil War is what makes up the rest of the plot.Acting wise even in a special appearance of sorts Pierce Brosnan steals the show, he has not lost his wit, and his screen presence is something special. Owen Wilson does good in his role but seems like a miscast. Lake Bell and the two girls are apt.One thing that really confused me about No Escape was that the film was confused between being a realistic gritty action drama, and a no holds bar entertainer. In one instance you see Owen Wilson throwing his children like a football from one building to the other in another Pierce Brosnan is talking about how America is the cause of every Civil War because they try to keep countries under developed. For me the film was like a the film Taken a bit of far fetched action, but solid entertainment. I mean it could seemed more realistic but like I stated before there is no emotional connect.And whats with not naming which country there talking about in the film, my geography is bad but its the country next to Vietnam. Hmmm interesting.Overall No Escape is a rather predictable film, but its pretty entertaining, because its shot well, it has a fast pace and good action. Its a one time watch for sure, but don't except too much from the film because there have been numerous films like No Escape made before.3.25/5* or 6.5/10",No Escape
86,kaptenvideo-89875,Party like Owen Wilson in 2001,4,9 December 2016,"Cheap-looking but mostly functional old-fashioned thriller about American family in unnamed Asian country caught in the middle of the coup, trying to escape to freedom.Watchable during the first hour, it gets gradually more monotonous and boring in the last 40 minutes. It could be just another straight to video thriller if it didn't have Owen Wilson, Lake Bell and Pierce Brosnan in starring roles. Sadly, there are no interesting characters or plot which consists mostly of trying to sneak past murderous Asians in locales that seem like leftovers from last ""Rambo"" movie. Which was great, by the way.The biggest draw here is certainly watching Owen Wilson not doing his usual schtick as aloof but really sweet guy who talks a lot. He still is all that, kind of, but setting is much more horrifying, and he even gets some blood on his hands.",No Escape
87,jb_campo,Surprisingly OK flick,6,17 September 2016,"I had my doubts but No Escape was a pretty decent take on the film genre of a family overseas when a revolution happens.Owen Wilson was pretty good as the father who takes his family to an unnamed country is southeast asia around his water-related job. He has a wife and two young daughters that he loves deeply. The day after they settle in at the hotel, the poop hits the fan as the government collapses.The movie is basically one long chase scene, as the anti-govt rebels track down foreigners and torture then kill them. As Wilson sees this, he knows he has only one option - try to escape. He tries one way, then another, then another, and quickly runs into blockages and escapes by thin margins.Along the way, Hammond (Pierce Brosnan) assists his family. Brosnan is pretty good as a salty, aging person of dubious background who has skills that get revealed as the film moves along.There is not too much else to say. In the end, there's a Hollywood ending and that's it. This film reminded me of The Year of Living Dangerously, or perhaps a bit of The Killing Fields, or even The Impossible. Anyway, it was a decent film that keeps moving, keeps you guessing, with a fair amount of drama and tension, without hitting you over the head with politics too much. We have enough of that nowadays in USA with clinton/trump.I think you will enjoy escaping to No Escape.",No Escape
88,ritera1,Action done well but no story or character development,6,24 May 2017,"Although the peril was done well, I really didn't buy the scenario and didn't appreciate the lack of character development. Sure, they had a decent opening scene with the coup assassination, but then it dragged quite a bit for a good amount of time. But it seemed like this generic character in the dad was really nothing special and it showed. He flies his family to a far off land for a job but really didn't seem like he spent any time researching the country he was about to live in. So then out of nowhere, a coup breaks out. Not just a coup where the citizen ""army"" of ""natives"" is both highly-organized but very inept at the same time. Nevermind that they are apparently extremely brutal, murderous to a fault and like to rape. I found it very offensive. Even remedial logic would dictate to even the most anamalistic group that slaughtering Americans and whites would be politically bad. Even in Iran in '79 they took hostages. I could maybe accept it in a silly James Bond movie, but not the tone they were striking here.At the same time it really lacked a singular bad guy. There was the guy at the hotel for 20 minutes, they lost him and then another one shows up after that for two scenes. Now this highly-organized group of butchers easily get control of both a helicopter and then a tank at just the right times, but they can't seem to navigate around the wicker furniture that the hotel staff puts in front of the main entrance. Also the implausible appearance of Brosnan's CIA agent at just the right time TWICE was too much to take. Nevermind the feeble excuse for it all that he gave. (I also had qualms on what the two kid actresses must have gone through.)Finally we have an end zone. Vietnam. I don't know about you but I would not be too fond of seeking a haven in Vietnam. Okay, as they neared the Vietnamese border in the boat, I sort of saw them getting a warning, but in perfect English? Then the boat crosses the border and everything SUDDENLY is fine. Then the Vietnames then issue another warning to the baddies following the family on the shore IN PERFECT English. Why didn't the bad guys shoot at the family before they hit the border?",No Escape
89,Ryan_MYeah,Thoroughly in one ear and out the other.,4,22 August 2015,"Directed by John Erick Dowdle, whose previous credits include the likes of Devil and As Above, So Below (Now there's a track record that gives faith), this film seemed to come virtually out of nowhere with little advertising even a week before its release, perhaps making one fear that its distributor, The Weinstein Company, don't have much confidence in it. So it's with a heavy heart that I can say that there's a reason for that.Admittedly, there's quite a bit of the film that has potential. With social outburst and riots at escalating tensions, the relevance of the topic does open it up to interesting commentary. I think I like the ideas of the film more than I do the execution, which doesn't give them the necessary expansion that they deserve. Overly simplifying its topics and barely even scratching the surface with them, such as its nondescript setting and the hardly touched upon backhanded business practices that generate much of the film's events, the film for the most part eschews more interesting material in favor of more direct focus on the lead family, struggling to survive a conflict that they barely understand. That also affects the crowds of locals, most of which are painted as easy villains with completely one note characterizations, rather than the film convincingly humanize them like a superior film like Captain Phillips would. However, even as a simple survival thriller, the film is still not a success. Given Dowdle's roots in suspense and horror, I can absolutely see why he would be drawn to a project like this, and he does make some admittedly creative decisions, even if they make no sense upon reflection. An opening scene shot mostly in one continuous take gives the film roots reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock, complete with a 60's style title card, but barely registers or fits in with the rest of the film that follows. Other choices that hinder his movie are a reliance on numerous slow-motion shots that often contribute unintentional hilarity to the experience. The overall ambiance and attention to detail can sometimes be impressive, in some instances not so subtly reminding me of The Last of Us, but without much substance to it, it all appears as flash without real meat. The more family centric elements are where most of Dowdle's attention is devoted, but they fail to generate much suspense given that, over the course of the film, we come to learn very little things about them. Most of their ""development"" is dedicated to throwaway lines that, once again, the film barely expands upon, saddling a talented cast with weak material. Back story aside, developments later in the story, in which they become more animalistic and deadly in their means of survival, hardly get much exposure or reflection, though to give some of them away would spoil a bit. There's also an attempt to liven the mood around them with brief comic relief, with some of it being effective, but others can become more ridiculous than alleviating, including one bit character obsessed with Kenny Rogers, as well as the rooftop scene in the trailers with Owen Wilson chattering about getting his daughter a dog before hurling her to the adjacent rooftop mid-sentence. Some decisions don't even need comedic roots to be utterly stupid, including one scene where that same daughter is forced to urinate in her own pants while the family hides in some rubble. I'm not kidding. With the sloppy material at their hands, the actors are then forced to somehow make it work, with some being successful enough. Owen Wilson wouldn't seem like the ideal man to play a role like this, but I find him likable and engaging enough for much of the film. He puts a lot more effort into this paper thin character than it perhaps deserves, and does have his emotions and heart in the right place. It makes me curious to see him in more dramatic fare. Lake Bell is less impressive as his wife, but still contributes some serviceable work. That's more than I can say for Pierce Brosnan. At first, this does seem like a refreshing change of pace from the Bond-Lite style performance he's specialized in since Die Another Day, but his alcoholic CIA operative is a mostly phoned in performance, appearing obnoxiously comical in the first act and completely disappearing until being shoehorned into the film's final stretches. Mostly, the film is just plain boring. It's thoroughly in one ear and out the other the moment you step out of the theater. It's shocking just how little the film ultimately impacts you. With all that said, do I think it's a bad film? Yes. Is it among the worst of the year? Not even close. It's more stale and forgettable than outright offensive as some of the worst movies I've watched this year. There are at least some decent things about it, and things I want to like about it, but a project like this needed more capable hands.",No Escape
90,herbqedi,A Family Taken Beyond Human Limits,10,31 August 2015,"Pacing is a top criterion for me in movies. This one sucks you in the beginning and never lets you move from the edge of your seat. The score is perfect, serving to tighten the suspense without ever being obtrusive and with the correct feel for a country like the one in question - at lest to an American ear.(I don't want to get lost in a sidebar but the identity of the country and ostensibly its capital city with a US Embassy has been discussed. I've hear to crossing a river to get to Vietnam is all wrong and it's generally a more glistening city. It's a fictional movie so perhaps it's meant to stay an amalgam. But if it's somewhat based on a real country, Burma/Myanmar would make more sense to me as Rangoon is on the side of the country across from Vietnam and the country has seen more than its share of human rights violations.)As has been pointed out, the director's brings his horror roots and creates a movie scarier than any horror movie because of the average American viewer's identification with the family. The rapidity with which a completely believable overseas assignment could suddenly turn into an unfathomable nightmare where chances of survival seem nil takes the viewer's breath away and never lets it go. When Wilson grabs his daughter from the pool and mutes her protests while his wife tries desperately to make the killers going room to room for foreigners and anyone perceived to be related to working for the company (including Asians), the wild ride begins. From that time to the time incognito agent Pierce Brosnan helps guide them to the roof where people frantically hope for escape, there is no time to breathe. When all others but them are slaughtered and they are the only ones who put together the obvious fact that the only alternative is to attempt a feasible but scary jump to a nearby building, there was no thought in my head that aspect was a bit far- fetched because the acting, direction, pacing, and flow made it seem perfectly consistent with the suddenly inhumane terror of their situation. The family dynamics and the evolution of Wilson's and Bell's thought processes throughout the frantic and at times aimless rush from anywhere to anywhere for survival are amazing and certainly separate this from a normal action movie with hero/heroes and a mission. There is nothing but doubt and lack of self-confidence in the minds and hearts of the two adult heroes and only the need to try to save the lives of their children keep them from the recriminations and remembering the sadness with which they began their journey. This psychology subtly carries the emotional dynamic under the actions when survival mandates encouraging the youngest girl to pee herself, then further as they need to kill as cold-bloodedly as their hunters for survival. The hesitancy and grief with which Wilson kills even though he know he has no alternative and the cold-bloodedness in which a dying Brosnan executes his duty are displayed in stunning contrast even though the frantic pace doesn't allow the audience to appreciate the comparison until the end.At the end - and the family's final escape is due to what is probably the least realistic and at the same time the most viscerally rewarding sequence in the movie - I couldn't inhibit myself from shouting ""Wow!"" aloud, and I am not easily impressed. In fact, even though this movie was completely fictional, the movie No Escape most reminded me of is the fact-based Hotel Rwanda. In very many ways, including the hero being a career-oriented family man suddenly thrust into desperate survival mode while a holocaust of murderous xenophobic frenzy breaks out all around him, the two situations are close parallels as was the excellence of the acting and the development of the characters from non-violent citizens with ordinary fears and problems into men of action who regret what they must do to survive. To me, these are much better analogies than Taken or Mission Impossible - did these heroes show an ounce of regret in doing what they have to do? Just part of the training, ma'am. Contributing to that dynamic is the equally stunning transformation of Lake Bell from whiner to having to be the mentally and physically strong one when Owen's psyche lapses (and every step in between). The daughters, while frustratingly annoying obstacles to their own safety, are incredibly realistically portrayed. Kudos to both young actors. Brosnan's professional and cynical agent, reminiscent of Ed Harris in Under Fire and Nick Nolte in Hotel Rwanda, provides a perfect contrast to the incredible physical and emotional stress experienced by an untrained family who never had an instant to analyze anything beyond survival.Anyway, even though it is to me an incredibly textured lead performance hitting many nuances right on the money, I don't expect Wilson to get nominated because of ""odious"" political motives that both left- wingers and right-wingers seem to be attributing to the film. Then again, you can never explain to me how an at-best flawed black comedy like Birdman won Best Picture against fantastic competition such as Imitation Game, American Sniper, Theory of Everything, Grand Budapest Hotel, etc. I'll summarize by saying that you are cheating yourself if you let critics deter you from this incredible experience. 10/10.",No Escape

92,CleveMan66,"""No Escape"" is the most intense and enjoyable action thriller in a long time.",10,28 August 2015,"""Intense!"" That's the word I heard myself use most often as I was telling another member of the Movie Fan Community Facebook Page staff about ""No Escape"" (R, 1:43). That is the single best word I know to describe this action thriller. The film is SO intense that it almost feels like a horror movie. No wonder. It was directed by John Erick Dowdle, who previously directed the underrated ""Quarantine"" (2008), 2010's ""Devil"" and 2014's ""As Above, So Below"". In addition to helming this one, he also co-wrote the script with his brother, Drew Dowdle, as he did with ""Quarantine"" and ""As Above"". Yet, ""No Escape"" is not a horror flick. This movie's thrills don't come from outer space or any supernatural realm. The dangers in this film come from what can be the most frighteningly real source of all – our fellow human beings.Owen Wilson and Lake Bell star as Jack and Annie Dwyer, a Texas couple who are moving, with their young daughters, Lucy (Sterling Jerins) and Breeze (Claire Geare) to an unnamed country in Southeast Asia for Jack's new job. Jack is an engineer who has been hired by an American company that's building up the water infrastructure in that country. There aren't many westerners in sight, but on the plane, the Dwyers meet a British man named Hammond (Pierce Brosnan), who makes frequent trips to this country. He seems mostly interested in partying and enjoying the country's ""charms"". Hammond's hedonistic persona makes Annie a little uncomfortable, but, once the plane lands, he connects the new arrivals with a local taxi driver (Sahajak Boonthanakit) whom people call Kenny Rogers, because of his obsession with the singer. Hammond and ""Rogers"" drop off the Dwyer's safely at their luxury hotel, but all six of these characters will meet again – soon, and under very different circumstances.Unbeknownst to them, there's a very strong undercurrent of anti-western sentiment in the country where the Dwyer family has just landed. A dramatic flash-forward scene which opens the movie gives an indication of how dangerous the situation really is, and foreshadows what's to come. The morning after arriving, Jack leaves the hotel in search of an American newspaper, only to find himself witnessing the beginning of a bloody revolution. Jack has to avoid murderous mobs to get back to the hotel and protect his family before it's too late. Thus begins an extremely violent and extraordinarily dangerous odyssey of trying to get the family together, get them out of the hotel and through what amounts to ""killing fields"" in the streets and to the American embassy in the hope that they'll be safe there.The next 24 hours are overflowing with seemingly insurmountable challenges and paralyzing frightening situations. Between the Dwyers and safety stand men who are as ruthless as ISIS and as anti-western as the terrorists who killed almost 200 people in Mumbai, India in 2008, and this is a place that's basically as lawless and unstable as many locations in Africa and the Middle East. Basically, this family of four, and the few others who are brave enough to help them, are in the midst of a perfect storm of the worst of humanity in the 21st century which makes for an incredibly thrilling and well-produced movie.The strength of ""No Escape"" starts with its cast. Owen Wilson might not seem like an obvious choice to be given the lead in an action thriller, until you remember a few things about Wilson: One of his first major roles was in the action war drama ""Behind Enemy Lines"" (2001), his persona in most of his roles since (even though they're mostly comedic) makes him the perfect loving and devoted family man, and he's also a damn fine actor. Lake Bell may not be a household name, but she is a recognizable face to frequent moviegoers and she delivers an amazing performance in this film. The actresses who play the two Dwyer girls hold their own very well. No surprise, when you realize that the older of the two is (at the tender age of 11) also a veteran of big movies such as ""Dark Places"", ""The Conjuring"" and ""World War Z"". Pierce Brosnan plays his most layered character in years and the Southeast Asian actors are universally solid in their various roles and never hit a false note.The directing and screen writing of the Dowdle Brothers give us an unbelievably effective action thriller. The movie starts off with a bang, then allows us to get to know the main characters just enough to care about them before plunging them and us into an unforgettably tense experience. The bright colors of the cinematography at the beginning of the film put the beauty of the region on full display, before those colors drain from the screen as the audience feels the color draining from their faces. The violence shown is bloody, but never gratuitous. It's mostly the film's tension that makes it so powerful.The combined intensity of the story's excitement and its empathic characters is almost beyond compare. Movies like ""Red Corner"" (1997) and ""Crash"" (2004) remain alive in my memory partly due to one or two especially tense and emotional scenes. Never did I imagine that one movie could pack so many such scenes into a single story. Before I saw this movie, I wondered whether the title ""No Escape"" was either a spoiler or typical Hollywood hyperbole. Now that I know the answer, I realize that the question is practically irrelevant. The main meaning ""No Escape"" carries for me now is a description of the place that the experience now holds in my movie memory. Intensely entertaining, ""No Escape"" gets an ""A+"".",No Escape

95,tr91,Greatly exceeded my expectations,8,3 November 2015,"No Escape is a film that greatly exceeded my expectations. The trailer a few months ago looked OK but I hadn't really heard anyone talking about this film. Having now seen it, I strongly urge more people to give it a chance as well. The storyline is excellent and we jump straight into the action. The action is very fast paced with proper sound effects to keep you on the edge of your seat. It's a very gripping film and I really connected with the characters and hoped they got out of their brutal predicament. I've seen similar actions films to this but the storyline really gave it a unique feel (to me anyway). Lake Bell & Owen Wilson shared good chemistry and both of their on screen daughters gave good believable performances. Overall a very enjoyable disaster type film and similar to San Andreas earlier in the year, I feel this one is underrated too. A fun watch which had me gripped from start to finish.

96,MinistryofDoom,An enjoyable ride hampered by illogical missteps & blatant stereotyping,6,24 July 2018,"This Owen Wilson/Lake Bell driven action film is an enjoyable yet difficult experience. It's strengths are in it's ability to depict the isolationd felt by expatriates in foreign lands far removed from the comforts and routines of which they are familiar. Place that into the context of a civil uprising in an un-named 3rd world country where they are not only unable to communicate and traverse the unknown landscape but are incapable of knowing whom are friends and foes, and you have a true thrill ride. The problem is that it is also difficult to watch as certain illogical missteps are made which ultimately put the family in far greater jeopardy, defying common sense, and threatening their survival. It also attempts to make a political statement though it is difficult to understand what that statement is, since it is lost in the clutter of the film's plot. What we do know is that an expatriate engineer travels to a non-descript Asian country (which borders Vietnam) along with his family to work on a project and almost immediately a violent uprising breaks out between armed civilians and riot police whom are quickly and easily dispatched. After that no where else in the entire film do we see any authority figures attempting to restore order (it seems that the civilians in the span of an hour have taken over the entire country and killed all the security officers). The civilians then begin to hunt down and publicly execute foreigners for unknown reasons. The US Embassy is completely destroyed. American soldiers are lying dead at it's doorstep but killed them and why? Why does the country's population hate foreigners? Why are the committing public executions? Where are the government officials? Where are the security forces? Why are all the civilians depicted as barbaric violent savages? None of these questions are ever answered; all we know is that a man, his wife, and two daughters are attempting to flee the country before they are killed. The film wants us to focus on their process of fleeing and not to question why they are fleeing and so we have action-packed thriller that is extremely light on context and does not provide much substance story-wise.",No Escape

99,stephendaxter,"Fun, Intense, and plenty of 'Edge-of-your-Seat' entertainment.",7,8 November 2015,"'No Escape' is an Action Thriller starring Owen Wilson, Lake Bell, and Pierce Brosnan. The film follows a family who move to Asia to pursue a job opportunity for Jack (Owen Wilson), but soon after their arrival they realise they have just dropped into the middle of a war-zone, and the fight to survive the chaos begins. The first act of the film wasn't really all that great, it was mainly setting up the characters and the situation they are in but there wasn't really anything of interest in the first 20 minutes or so. The only thing worthwhile from the opening act was that it makes you care for this family and that really helped to elevate the rest of the film. From that 20 minute mark, when the second act begins, the film instantly gets incredibly intense and dramatic, and it doesn't slow down for the rest of the film. The thriller elements in the film i thought were very very effective, i was on the edge of my seat for most of this movie, holding my breath and had sweaty palms because of how intense it would get. And what i loved was that it didn't just go intense for 5 minutes and then slow right back down, the tensions were high and when the film got intense it stayed intense for a really long time. Within the second act which goes for like an hour it is pretty much constant intense action and drama apart from like 2 short breaks, even though it did get a little exhausting at times i still loved it. All of those intense action set pieces, and the tough edge-of-seat moments would not have been anywhere near as effective if you didn't care about this family. The film did a great job at making you feel connected to these people and so whenever there is a scary situation you are really rooting for this family and whenever someone gets out of a tight situation you breathe a sigh of release. That does show for some good work establishing the characters, unfortunately they don't really evolve at all throughout the film, their persona's are set from the first act and don't really change at all which was a little unfortunate. But i have to say i thought both Owen Wilson and Lake Bell were great in their roles. They weren't given characters with an incredible amount of depth but they managed to convey the emotions and feelings of these characters really well. When they are in an intense situation you can see the pain they are in from the expressions on their faces and it really helps to maintain some realism in the film.The plot of the film isn't great, the only plot is fed to you in the first 20 minutes and very very briefly later on in the film. The characters were literally just given the task of surviving and that is really what just propels the film forward. They try to give a bit of backstory to the situation later on in the film, it only takes up a few minutes but wasn't really necessary. The biggest issue i had with the film was Pierce Brosnan's character, they set him up early in the film but then he disappears for pretty much the entire film and is simply a Deus Ex Machina that shows up for no other purpose other than to further the plot. He was for me a wasted character that had a couple of good moments, the film could have benefited from a little more Brosnan.So in the end this is a really fun, intense, gripping Action Thriller. The plot isn't important to the film at all, and if you strip it back you realise it is essentially just an intense popcorn flick that you can really enjoy watching. It is almost non stop drama once it begins and the fast pace really makes sure you never lose interest in what's happening. - 7.2",No Escape
100,TheRadiobox,No interest in visiting Unnamed Asian country,5,5 August 2020,"No Escape was directed by John Erick Dowdle, written by John Erick Dowdle and Drew Dowdle, and stars Owen Wilson, Lake Bell, Sterling Jerins, Claire Geare, and Pierce Brosnan. It is about a family that has recently moved to a south Asian country, and as they settle in, a coup takes place within the country; and those responsible are killing all foreigners on sight. The family has to escape while they have time.Plotting is built wholly on running, which is a commendable effort, but needed more substance or set pieces to serve its story. Jack Dwyer's (Wilson) personal company recently went bankrupt, and now working under another company, he takes his wife Annie (Bell), and daughters Lucy and Beeze (Jerins and Geare) to live in an unnamed Asian country as he works. On the plane they meet Hammond (Brosnan), and experienced traveler with a military background who acts as a bodyguard to the family. While they were settling into a hotel, the Prime Minister is assassinated, and on the following morning the family and Hammond see clashes between rioters and police. The group must find either a safe place to hide, or cross a border.Characters are weak, but since the movie barely lets up this does not matter too much. Jack has a past that, in a way, catches up with him. He is shown to be an independent guy by working for himself, but has to submit when things do not work out for him. Annie is just ""the wife character"", while she is a strong person; being able to bear the situation at hand, her only notable trait is her regretting the decision to move out of the US. Lucy and Beeze have no real personality, and nothing to differentiate the two aside from their ages. Hammond is really out of place; not necessarily in his character, but in his dialogue. His character only serves to make jokes and be a deus ex machina, coming into play in only a few situations, in all of which he saves someone from the Dwyer family. Performances are limited in range; Wilson is strangely believable in his role as a strong family man in will and in strength, although the movie does push the limit. Bell does well with showing the stress and works good as a pairing with Wilson. Jerins, Geare, and Brosnan are all fine.Thrills come in doses, with some scenes of panic and action working well, and others falling flat. The initial encounter between Jack and both sides of the conflict is fine, but is not very well edited; as are many scenes. Thankfully there is next to no shaky cam, instead the movie places its bets on slow motion, most of which just comes off as gratuitous. Wilson and Bell's reactions to the scenes that are captured with slow motion are already enough on their own and the added effect only feels like the film makers hammering home a point that has already been made. Cool moments are present, such as the sequence where Jack has to retrieve Lucy while the rioters are taking over the hotel the family was staying in, and another involving Jack and a boat. Other times the thrills feel forced, with the Dowdle's script abandoning logic in a few key scenes for the sake of manufactured tension.Technically the movie is sound. While the script does suffer from some unnecessary characters and slo-mo, and has some difficulty managing tone when Hammond is on the screen; the set design and camerawork are very well done, making sure to keep the movie grounded in a degree of reality, and keep it all in focus, unlike other action movies of recent years. Marco Beltrami's score is not the most memorable or creative, but does enhance the experience with its presence. Suddenness of events does help the more manipulative moments feel real, as though a family was thrust into a spot they had no idea they would be in.No Escape is a mixed bag of tricks, with some manipulative moments, underdeveloped motivations for the rioters and their assassination of the Prime Minister of generic Asian country, there are good moments to be found; most notably the believable performances from Wilson and Bell; and some thrilling scenes.56/100",No Escape
101,michaelhirakida,The new masters of the Thriller!,9,4 September 2015,"No Escape is brutal. So brutal in fact that this movie only has a 14 rating in Canada. This movie is not for 14 year old teens at all. This movie has a sexual assault, people getting run over, people getting shot, rioting and to top it all, a barbecue chihuahua. This should get a R Rating in Canada and an NC-17 in America because this movie is so brutal and violent. But that doesn't mean the movie is not good, it's amazing! The story settles around a family moving to a South Asian country where the prime minister of that country is killed and war is on the streets. Jack Dwyer's family must escape to the Vietnamese border before they are killed.Let me just start by saying that yes, the movie can be xenophobic which tends to lead to unpleasant scenes, but the movie is about a political disaster that forces people to take action against the Americans because they think they were the race responsible for killing the prime minister. So there is a reason for this.But still, The Dowdle Brothers are the new masters of the Thriller. Their style is one of the strong points of this movie, with the beginning being one of my favorite scenes of this year, the movie is shocking and intense with many things happening all at once, the film leaves a powerful impact on all but a few of it's viewers. The cinematography is unbelievable and stunning, scenes like jumping across a roof top thrilled me, and it leaves you feeling rewarded at the end.No Escape is one of my favorite films of the summer and it's a good film to go off with a bang.

105,Sankari_Suomi,Lazy scriptwriting and casual racism. Hooray for white people!,2,10 November 2015,"Owen H. Wilson and Pierce J. J. M. Brosnan star in this astonishingly offensive insult to human intelligence.Wilson plays an American engineer whose job takes him to an obscure country populated entirely by little yellow people, situated somewhere south of China, and identified only as 'Asia.' Later in the movie we learn that Asia shares a border with Vietnam, which does seem to make sense on a certain level.Anyway, Wilson and his family check into a 5 star hotel where nothing works properly because it's Asian, ha ha, and those funny little yellow people just can't do anything right, ho ho, so their idea of 5 star is equivalent to our idea of 2 star, hee hee. Let's all laugh at the incompetent little yellow people and their crappy '5 star' hotel! Good times.Within hours of Wilson's arrival the entire nation is plunged into anarchy by a military coup that starts with the assassination of the prime minister, whose security precautions involved standing around in a completely unguarded area with a couple of waiters, and just hoping nobody would shoot him. The deficiencies of this plan are much clearer in hindsight, apparently.While one group of coup members ransacks the prime minister's palace or summer residence or 2 star hotel or whatever the hell it is, the rest of them hit the streets and go looking for trouble. Having roused the locals to a fever pitch, they clash spectacularly with riot police, whose firearms, shields and body armour are no match for people wearing loose cotton and carrying sticks and stones.For reasons nobody's sure about, the citizens of Asia have decided all white people must die. Wilson gathers his family and heads to the roof with the rest of the white people, where they are met with a hail of bullets from a helicopter that conveniently crashes minutes later because otherwise the movie would be over by now.It is here that Wilson learns a vital secret that will keep his family alive for the rest of the movie: little yellow people can't see you as long as you're crouching beneath something. You don't even need to be fully concealed; just get under something and nobody will know you're there.Wilson and his family escape from the roof by jumping to another building and throwing their children across an impossible gap, as you do.From here it's a predictable slalom down the slopes of incredulity as the Wilsons escape more yellow people (portrayed as bug-eyed zombies) and eventually team up with James Bond (played by Pierce J. J. M. Brosnan) who admits he might be sort of partly responsible for the local unrest, because he's 'British CIA' or 'something like that', and the government of Asia owes money it can't repay to the USA and UK, so of course killing all the white tourists who bring essential revenue to the nation is the best way to solve this problem.In a series of increasingly predicable scenes, Bond's little yellow sidekick is killed by the angry little yellow people and Bond himself is accidentally run over by a truck because even international super-spies sometimes forget to look twice before crossing the street.Meanwhile the entire coup army is hunting the Wilsons, since they're the only white people left alive in Asia. The Wilsons prove much harder to kill than expected because that's what the script requires. Eventually they reach the border, where Vietnamese soldiers threaten to kill them if they enter Vietnam. Naturally they ignore this (because hey, the Vietnamese are just little yellow people) and sure enough they are not killed at all. Instead, the Vietnamese army protects them from the coup army, which has arrived just in time to look mildly embarrassed about the whole situation.Roll credits, throw popcorn.I rate No Escape at 6.66 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a negligible 2/10 on IMDb.",No Escape

And then the locals hate the Americans for disrupting their economy and want blood for water. This is what happens to Dwyer family headed by Owen Wilson as Jack, wife Annie (role played very well by Lake Bell) and their 2 cute daughters Lucy(Sterling Jerins) and Beeze ( Claire Geare from Dream House). Owen Wilson is convincing as a loving husband & a doting father. Movie is directed well. One of my favorite scenes was the local rebel forcing Lucy to shoot Jack and him holding the gun to shoot Lucy. The scene when Annie has to jump from 1 terrace to the other and the kids have to follow is excellent. Real fear. Dwyer family stick together through all the rough times and their bonding and love for each other is transparent. Jack riding the scooter with his whole family , all heads bent, is good. Well done. enjoyed the movie a lot.",No Escape
107,Sci-FiHorrorFan,This is a dark and Brutal Action Thriller.,9,25 November 2015,"I Really Enjoyed this film it was very thrilling and Action Packed.i was also surprised at how dark and gritty this film was. this film has a very dark atmosphere to it and i think that added to the suspense of the film. this film has so much action that i couldn't take my eyes of the screen. Owen Wilson was great in this film and so was Peirce Bronson. The story is Simple;An American Family goes away on Holiday and when they get there a crazy war starts.a gang of people from that country start killing tourists.they kill people one by one in the Hotel and Owen Wilson and his family try to escape in the chaos. i liked the four main characters of the film,they were likable and i felt sorry for them when they were being chased. i thought the acting was very good from everyone and i also thought the writing was good. the film was also very well directed. the bad guys were Brutal Maniacs,they were really nasty pieces of work and i would Not want to run into these people. the bad guys used guns and grenades and cannons among other weapons to hunt people with and they blew everything to pieces.This Film is Definitely Brutal and bloody.the film is action packed and i was hooked all the way through.it was fast paced and adrenaline pumping and i never got bored once. this film had me on the edge of my seat the whole time and the film was very intense!. the film has a lot of chase scenes in it and it was a very entertaining film. The film also had a sense of realism to it and i think thats why a lot of critics didn't like the film because the stuff that happens in the film is stuff that is happening in the world now and maybe thats why they didn't like it because it reminded them too much about the wars that go on in The world. I have to Respectfully disagree with the critics.the film being realistic did Not bother me at all. its a movie folks and i was entertained by it,i was too busy enjoying the film to care about it being realistic. also i don't see why thats a bad thing but thats just my opinion,Either way to each His Own. I Thought the film had some very emotional scenes in it that were handled very well and i felt really sorry for Owen and his family because they were Innocent in the whole thing,they were simply just in the wrong place at the wrong time.I Liked Owens Character a lot because i found him very brave and i liked his determination to get his family to safety. i thought the emotional scenes between him and his daughters were handled very well and they were very convincing. thats one of the major pros for this film,you like all of the main characters and you want them to escape. i was cheering for them almost the whole movie!. i Also liked Peirce Bronson he kicked a lot of Ass and he Had a really Badass moment in the Film and i cheered for him too especially in that scene.i wont spoil it just watch the film and you'll know what i mean. Owen Wilsons Character was also Strong and Brave and i like that in the end he Fought back against the bad guys. the biggest pro for this film is definitely the Action,The film has so much action that the film doesn't give you a chance to come up for air and when the film ended i was overwhelmed by how good it was.The Ending was a bit Rushed and thats the only problem i have but everything else worked well. Overall this was A Very Good Film it was a Very Tense Thrill Ride and I Highly Recommend It.",No Escape

The drama is as strong as something out of the ""deer hunter"" which even gets amplified by the involvement of children.First the parents try to shield their children from the violence but it gets so out of hand that that's no longer an option.Also it shows what parents are capable of when a loved one and especially a child is threatened and it plays this out very strong.All of the actors play memorable roles but the 2 little girls impressed the most by playing so natural while all the mayhem is going on.Further,good writing,good directing and one of the few times a trailer that didn't spoil anything.I really,REALLY recommend this movie.Will watch it again in the future but will wait some time because it was also quite an impact.Go see this,it's totally worth it.",No Escape

I thought it was interesting that Washington Post‍ '​s Stephanie Merry, complained that ""every Asian character is either a ruthless murderer or anonymous collateral damage."" The old Asian man and the boat man, as well as ""Kenny Rogers"" helped them. And since the writers didn't do the greatest job developing the main characters, did she and other critics really expect the film to delve much into very minor characters? Aside from the not-so-great character development, it had edge-of-your-seat action. Some of it you could see coming, like when the helicopter approaching the people on the roof turns out to be controlled by the rebels, but it was a very well-done scene. I thought everyone in the movie, especially Owen Wilson and Pierce Brosnan did a great job with their roles. Lake Bell was good enough, even though her character's basic role was to cry throughout the movie. The little girls were irritating, as you'd expect they'd be in a situation like this.Pierce Brosnan's character gave a good sum up of why the people were acting as they were. I had to laugh when Wilson asked him if he was with British MI6 or something like that, and Brosnan said ""Something like that."" It seemed almost like a wink and a nod to his days as Bond -- James Bond.Overall, it was a fun movie, and I recommend it to anyone who loves action/adventure films. 7/10 stars from me.",No Escape
113,eryui,Great no stop suspenseful action movie,9,24 January 2016,"""No Escape"" is actually underrated and that's why I felt to review it. Some viewers should realize that this movie do not want to be a political movie, it is not centered to that; the coup d'etat, although based on possible and credible reasons, is a pretest to get the family escape and action started. This is indeed a run to survive action movie and it does a great job in what it is. It is a tough movie (not for children), not heroes, very suspenseful as I like, no time to breath, believable and also touching in some parts and dialogs. I have been stuck on my chair after the short intro till the end, and enjoyed it. Sometime, this is all I ask to a movie.Originality: 6 (not really the first)Plot: 6 (simple, but fit for purpose) Characters: 10 (very good and they fit the roles. Owen was great.)Dialogue: 7 (essential but believable) Pacing: 10 (its strongest point)Cinematography: 8 (just well done)Direction: 8 (just fine)Entertainment Value: 10 (another essential strong point, not boring at all)My grand total is around 8/10, above 7 for sure to me, but I gave it 9/10 because it's right one of my preferred genre and as entertainment action/thriller value it should deserve really more then the actual and too severe 6.8. This movie was really gripping to watch.Thank you for reading,Regards",No Escape

My two problems are that of course both kids are girls because that's what makes it all the more suspenseful. You fear more for girls than for boys. Also, the mom wouldn't take so long to get to the dad's and daughter's rescue at the end when they're on the beach. The absurd amount of time is unrealistic and merely to build up suspense as much as possible.

Seeing Owen Wilson in an action film had me concerned, surprisingly he and Lake Bell gave good performances. Despite that the film fails, for a multitude of reasons, most notably the story. The story is both generic and predictable, on top of that the story is a little too complex. Besides the story almost all of the characters have no development, besides Lake Bell's character who had a good amount of development. The villains were weak as they felt like nothing but faceless villains, if it weren't for one line of dialogue we'd have no idea why they are trying to kill these people. Lastly the camera-work is bad, there's absurd amounts of shaky cam, and the action sequences are almost impossible to follow. In conclusion the generic plot, weak character development and villains, and poorly shot action sequences make No Escape a mediocre action film, despite a good turn by Owen Wilson.",No Escape
119,theemuhammede,Not the ordinary Owen Wilson,9,12 May 2016,"This movie really showed a different side of Owen Wilson that not many of the movie viewers are familiar with. A lot of people are used to him being an immature and funny character in his roles. But not this time. He actually played a serious and much more drama-filled role.Jack Dwyer, played by Owen Wilson, finds himself in a predicament where it is life or death for him, his wife, and his two daughters. It did not help that he and his family were relocated to Southeast Asia because of Jack's work. So they were new to the territory, and they had no help except for each other.There was a scene when Jack and his family were on the roof top of a building and had to jump at least a 10 foot gap to the next building in order to escape death. The wife jumps. She makes it. But now Jack has to get his two young girls over there. They are both too young to jump that far so he has no choice but to risk throwing them across and his wife is waiting to catch them. That scene was intense. The way it was filmed literally gets a person to move to the edge of his or her seat.There were only two things that were annoying about this movie. Pierce Brosnan's character Hammond was the first. The second was the last bit of the movie. Hammond's character was not needed for this movie. If he was completely removed from this story and it most likely would have been better. He was short lived as it is in the movie, and Brosnan shadowed over Wilson for a bit. Then the last bit of the move slowed down from what the prior scenes were. It was still good, but it was not as fast paced.Owen Wilson's performance surpassed all expectations. He should continue pursuing new roles to diversify his acting ability and career.",No Escape
120,cmovies-99674,This action packed thriller is so electrifying and lively,9,12 August 2017,"PROS: The acting from the ENTIRE cast was so unbelievably awesome. Lake Bell who is one of my favorite actresses, gave one of her best performances in years. To add on, Owen Wilson played his role perfectly. He delivered every emotion in its rawest form; sadness, fear, anger, security, etc. were delivered by the whole cast, even the little girls who stole the show. Another amazing part of the film was the story line. This concept of rebellion and the families struggle through it was so perfectly delivered with few to no plot holes. I was able to comfortably watch the movie without worrying about pathetic attempts to make the movie more engaging, everything was thought out. This movie is my favorite movie of all time for many reasons, but the biggest reason was the ending. The ending came so abruptly, which was nice because it gave the watcher the same sigh of relief as it did to the characters. The ending was able to make you feel the same exact emotion as it did to those characters. Yet another great part about this film was the development of the characters. You were able to relate to any one character, and you stayed in tune with that character as the film progressed. But you also didn't feel detached from the other characters, which was nice.CONS: The one con that I had was not something I noticed on my own, but someone brought it to my attention. The build up of tension lagged in some spots, but this didn't bother me because it felt natural. But there were a few scenes where the characters were just sitting and not doing anything.www.chorror.com",No Escape
121,FlorianLaur,Owen Wilson keeps impressing me,8,26 March 2021,"Lately, I have a new-found appreciation of Owen Wilson as an actor. He used to strike me as a silly, half-talented actor (similar to how I used to see Ben Stiller), but thanks to movies like this or ""The Big Year"", Wilson shows that he is a good actor. He can make you laugh, but he can also make you care.I saw ""No Escape"" some years ago with my father and we were both impressed. We hadn't heard of the movie (I don't remember it being in cinemas in Germany) and we both enjoyed it.It's a tense thriller that avoids most of the clichés these kind of movies often have.Many times, in movies like this, they overplay the whole ""Americans are the best people"" and ""everyone can die, but hey, Americans are special"" card. True, the movie sometimes does come close to fall into that category, but for an American film, it seems to at least try to point out the ignorance many expats often show when they move overseas (especially Asia). Believe me, as someone who lived several years in Asia myself, I know the type.One thing I didn't quite get is why the rioters kept killing so many of their own. One could argue that the hotel staff might be seen as an extension of Western influence, but why would they kill the Gamelan players or butcher office staff?I recommend this film as a very good piece of escapism with a somewhat realistic storyline that doesn't require constant suspension of disbelief. The acting is good too and the characters are likeable enough. I give it an 8/10 (good movie, worth some rewatches).",No Escape
122,RobTortureWright,From Exciting to Generic and Predictable.,5,24 January 2016,"When watching the beginning of this film I was extremely positive that this was going to be a breath of fresh air, But it slowly faded to a typical mediocre film. You all know what I'm talking about... the one you watch in the background while messing around on your phone or doing something else.Now don't get me wrong this isn't one of those awful Hit-man Agent 47 borderline face palm films but at times No Escape suffers from poor writing and predictability. For me the slight decent began at the exact moment Jack (Owen Wilson) throws his second daughter over to the other building. From there I could predict exactly what was going to happen next. Jack jumps and makes it across while random Asian guy who has been standing there the whole time like the nicest human being ever gets shot.What happens next had me shaking my head. A tank... really ? Why would the enemies not jump over, If a family can make it then so can they. I was disappointed at this because I could picture a better possibility where the family are stuck in that building with enemies both below and above them and have to navigate around a particular floor to escape certain death. There were a few other moments that let this film down, such as the ""Rape"" Scene where I was certain some miraculous event would occur to put a stop to it and as I envisioned it did. Add all of this with Pierce Brosnans character being a generic hero who just happens to be at the hotel and this film adds up to predictable. The reason I'm being so tough is because I can imagine a much grittier, tense thriller where there is no hero to save the day, Where life changing awful things happen to particular members of the family and we are left truly questioning what is going to happen next and will they ever be the same again.",No Escape

He is a Mechanical Engineer and his job would be to help the water supply in the country. The problem is that an uprising takes place and now Jack must protect his family and get out of the country. Sometimes I wonder why certain movies are made and this one should not have been made. It is too intense, brutal in places and what Jack's children are exposed to is almost a crime. Two examples: (1)They are actually thrown from one building to another and (2) a child taken by one of the rebels and is given a loaded gun and it's pointed at Jack with the instruction to ""pull the trigger."" See? This is entertainment? Hardly. And now we wait for the copycat directors to do ""better."" (sad, but probably true)Owen Wilson does a good job in this drama. I guess he figured he did good in MIDNIGHT IN Paris and this would be a piece of cake. And it was. He did good. It was those other things with the children and the rebels with machetes hacking everyone that is white that caused constant cringing. And these rebels are especially looking for Jack and family as they know he came to work on the water supply and they felt betrayed as the company took control over the water problems and left them out. We see Pierce Bronsnan as a British CIA person who tries to help Jack and, of course, he does good too, but this is Wilson's movie and Brosnan's screen time is limited. Because of the intensity, I was on the edge of my seat practically the whole time. Not good.

126,PerryAtTheMovies,A violent and suspense full that is worth watching....,7,4 April 2021,"Initial Thoughts:
I really enjoyed this movie because from start to finish it had me on the edge of my seat. Lots of action. Great suspense. While I could assume what would happen next. I still waited in anticipation for it to actually happen. While some things surprised me. I still thought this movie was great.First things first. Lots of unfiltered action and violence with clubs, machetes, and guns. Unfiltered meaning you saw people get shot or bludgeoned and it wasn't about to happen and then cut away and implied. To go along with the violence you may have seen the MPAA includes sexual assault in it's reasoning to the 'R' rating. There is only one scene where it gets as far as tearing clothes, but nothing beyond that is assumed, committed, or exposed, but it is unpleasant to watch in the moment. If this is a breaking point into whether you watch this film, or not, that's what that means.Second, ""wow""... Owen Wilson does a surprisingly good job in this film as he's usually known for romance and comedy movies. Besides ""Behind Enemy Lines"" (which is a good movie in which he does a cheesy job) I can't really think of an action movie that Wilson has played in. Obviously, he's older and more mature now, but he acted very well as a father and husband, with no discernable fighting skills, trying to save his family from becoming bludgeoned to death by the hordes. His character stays calm, cool, and collect for most of the film until he's exhausted and starts to lose focus. This shows us that he is in fact human and done with what is going on.Third, while the movie was overall good by it's action and suspense. The story lacked considerably. The antagonist of the story is never given any true beginning. He just walks around with his scarred face trying to kill Westerners. We are given a 'why' because of a Pierce Brosnan character explanation late in the film, but it would've been nice to get some dialogue on this characters backstory. Other areas where it seems to be harmed is the lack of attack. In some parts while the enemy are shooting from distance, there are no fighters closing in on positions, thus allowing our family to escape. Lastly, within the family, the only character with any true common sense, or will to fight is Owen Wilson's character. The wife, played by Lake Bell, is never given the opportunity to thrive, and be strong female lead, like I felt she could've been. I know it's scary being in the environment they find themselves in, but you'd think eventually the children (being as old as they are) would understand the concept of being quiet when necessary and having to do some things to survive. Alas, it's one problem after another with them.Overall:
I thought this was a really good action movie with its unfiltered violence, and good build-up of suspense. Story and characters lacked a bit in how they were developed or played out, but there is enough there to enjoy this film. I would definitely watch it again and if you have Prime Video, go for it.""Should I watch this movie?"" My answer is 'Yes'.Enjoy the show!",No Escape

His company sent him there because of their plans to improve the water quality within the region. Soon after their arrival, they learn that they're now in the middle of a political uprising. Now they must face armed rebels ordered to kill foreigners that they see. Despite the impending chaos, he must find a way to save both him and his family from all of the violence around them.If I could use one word to describe this film, it would be intense. Luckily for us, it all starts very early on. More about that later. From the music, the camera work, the action, and the performances by both leads (Wilson and Bell) who are known primarily for comedic roles, you can really feel that intensity. I will say that this film is violent but I never found it inappropriate as it added to the intensity. I liked how the plot kept moving forward as the characters kept moving forward themselves as they were always in a sense of danger. And because of what I've already mentioned, you feel that sense of danger as a viewer. Because of that, I was often on the edge of my seat watching. What the film did well was that it created several moments of suspense and tension which created a great degree of uncertainty. For the most part, they held onto this but they started going away from it closer to the end when Jack decides to turn on his ""my family's in danger so now I know how to fight and use guns"" switch. I would have preferred more of the former than the latter but that is a minor complaint. I can't go too much further without mentioning an appearance by Pierce Brosnan as Hammond who is pretty much James Bond who is wearing a Hawaiian shirt instead of a tuxedo. I wish we could have had more of him because I thought he stole all the few scenes he was in. I liked the story but I thought it was missing something as it never really explained the cause of the political uprising other than showing one scene at the beginning and a brief conversation later on. I would have liked to have seen more about this otherwise it's just Americans running away from Asians with guns and knives. Some have said this film is racist because of this and also it's depiction of the Asian people but the argument could be made that the filmmakers were a little ignorant about Asian culture.

I mean for a director who has directed the majority of his movies in the Horror genre John Dowdle hit a Home Run with this movie. I will say that this movie isn't for the feint of heart there is a plethora of violence and it doesn't shy away from serious subject matter and the brutality of civil war. I loved the story while it was simple it was set up perfectly. The story is Owen Wilson takes his family to Cambodia or somewhere near there for a relocation for his job and a coup starts up almost as soon as they land and I will leave it at that much.

Action when you keep asking yourself how are they going to escape from this now? With a recent failed coup attempt all this seemed even more plausible and reminded you that this could actually happen in real life. Lessons: obviously the main lesson here would be don't go to a an unstable country in the third or fourth world (unless you are a native of that country). Don't go for work, don't go for holidays. Of course this might sound a bit silly since you can't isolate yourself from seeing the world because of fear but this movie defiantly opened my eyes to really consider the places I am going in the future Read a lot about their politics and stability just for the sake to be informed and take measures. A good lesson or more of a reminder that these places do actually exist and these people committing those crimes on those considered as the enemy are real as well. A wake up call that the Wester world is not all that is out there. The movie explained brilliantly the motives of those hunting Americas: they are trying to protect their families as well, their people from enslavement from the western world. These ideologies are very likely to be true and they drive people to inhuman behaviour just like in this movie.

The movie is full of action, drama, and heart-felt pain in which the characters experiences. After viewing this movie, I am going to be careful where I travel. Many people in other countries hate Americans, the British, and Europeans for that matter, because of the way their land, natural resources, and water has been ravaged. Americans, the British, etc. come over into a country and take over, not allowing the natives any say. The Europeans came over to the, now-called America lands, and brutally attacked the natives and took the land. Historically, man has been pillaging one another's lands for centuries.

This one tries to create a similar feel but it fails to work because we all know, now, that this is not type of situation is likely to occur in Thailand.

140,ryanmark-57919,No Escape is Good but not for Everyone,8,30 August 2015,"This movie came as a bit of a surprise. I thought this movie would be interesting to see and I figured I would enjoy it but I actually liked it quite a bit more than I was expecting. The movie is very intense and easily scarier than most horror movies despite not even being a horror movie. It's scary because of how well done the characters are and how easily it is to empathize with them. The movie is directed and partly written by John Erick Dowdle, a man that makes enjoyable movies but not what I would call great movies. However, this movie impressed me just because of how suspenseful the scenes are and how much I found myself rooting for the characters.The movie follows Jack (Owen Wilson) and Annie Dwyer (Lake Bell) as they move to Malaysia with their two daughters. Jack just got a new job working in a water purifying plant in Malaysia and the whole family go there to start anew. Unfortunately, they just so happen to arrive on the same day the Prime Minister is murdered and the whole country flies into chaos. Unfortunately, part of the rebels' plan is to murder the foreigners staying in the country. This means that the Dwyers have to find a way out of the country without falling into the hands of the rebels.Owen Wilson and Lake Bell really shine in this movie. It's sometimes easy for me to forget that Wilson isn't just a comedic thespian but has some good acting chops to back it up and Bell usually doesn't fail to give us a good performance. It also helps that they have excellent chemistry on screen together. Part of the reason we root for these characters so much is because they're so easy to empathize with. They're trying to survive what seems like impossible odds and we see that in the performance they give. The only other actor that I actually recognize is Pierce Brosnan who also does a fantastic job as the irascible and lovable Hammond. Brosnan gives us a great performance but he isn't in the movie much at all. It's really all about the family.One thing that surprised me about the film is how intense it is. The rebels start killing everyone and when I say everyone, I mean everyone. The movie turns into a straight up blood bath at times. There's even an attempted rape scene that was a little hard to watch. The movie is great and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone that wants to see some good suspense but be warned that it's not for everyone.The message of the film is important but only lightly touched upon. The rebels are upset that foreigners are taking advantage of them and their country and that is what leads to the chaotic and bloody coup. I agree with the premise and allegory behind the film but it's a little hard to root for the rebels when they act like the most evil bunch of scum around. There is no mercy shown whatsoever to any of the people that the rebels come across. They even seem to enjoy the killing. In a way this works to the movie's advantage because it makes it that much scarier if the Dwyers are caught but it also makes the Malaysian rebels seem barbaric in relation to most people. It would have been nice to see that some of the rebels at least felt empathy or compassion.Overall, I have to admit that I really enjoyed the movie much more than I thought I would. It's not anything that hasn't been done before but it's done well and the movie is entertaining. I would definitely recommend it if you guys are looking for a suspenseful movie for the weekend.",No Escape

But my 5 is also for the total failure of being precise on the political level.it's simple; do you want to make an action movie or a political movie? If you want both you go down the drain. (Unless your name is ben affleck) And so this movie goes down the drain.I disagree with many in this platform that this movie was intentionally racist. It is racist but not intentionally. The writers are either inexperienced, stupid or lazy. They toss around with symbolics like we didn't learn anything in the last decades, making every minute in this movie a racist one, because they 'misuse' stereotypes to bring across what they, or money-obsessed producers wanted: action.If they wouldn't have gone for action in the first place they could have produced a movie that follows a western family, arriving in a world they do not really know. That concept could have been honoring the Asian country, since we do not know too much of the world in general other then our media tells us - link too the the conflict in the middle east etc....our white family would learn something about letting go on so many western luxurious axioms and make their visit a initiation in learning to learn from other cultures. The fact that the main character works for this nasty American water company, would then be the ignition of our drama. Especially when the manipulations of this firm cause the bloodbath portrayed in the movie. This is a painful truth, completely waisted in favor of the action. It needs screen time to work and to accept for us, viewers, that so many bad guys are yellow of color. My believe is that this is what the makers of this movie originally wanted. But he....maybe i'm naive. My close friends probably laugh and say, you ingmar, you want to see the best in anyone all the time.Well...who knows.

The people in the movie were supposed to be Thai but everything else was not really Thai (e.g., the protesters, the junta government, all the signs, the brothel). Furthermore, Thailand shares no border with Vietnam. I would say that this movie gives such a false (and almost unfair) portrayal of the country.

147,npvarley,Very poor.,2,27 December 2015,"OK, I very rarely write scathing reviews of movies,but this really was rubbish. Normally I can suspend disbelief, but not in this case.First of all, we live here in Thailand, next door to Cambodia, which is presumably the country they were trying to say went into meltdown. Sure, Cambodia has a troubled history, but this sort of stuff is now consigned to the past. And we are supposed to believe that one bloodthirsty revolutionary leader is going to pursue this one American family all over town, to the exclusion of all other revolutionary activities? Total tripe. And I'm not quite sure where the producers of this movie learned their geography, but it certainly wasn't in an atlas. The US Embassy in Cambodia is Phnom Penh, which is miles from the Vietnamese border, so just hopping in a boat and drifting five minutes down stream isn't going to get you to the Vietnamese border!The acting is ropey at best. Brosnan mails in his performance, sporting a dreadful fake Cockney accent. Wilson looks like he wants to smirk at the camera much of the time and really isn't going to cut it as an action player on this evidence. Bell just looks like a fish out of water.

148,ninjawaiter,A Perfect Film,10,21 December 2018,"In my opinion there are very few perfectly crafted films out there, and this one was an absolute shock to discover. I'd never heard of it, never heard of the writer/director (John Erick Dowdle, who apparently mostly makes horror films), and wasn't really expecting much when I pulled it up on Netflix.And then I was blown away. There is not a single wasted or misplaced scene or moment or shot or line of dialogue in this film. You couldn't cut a second of it without losing something vital. The prologue is (like the entire rest of the film) beautifully shot and absolutely concise. It conveys everything it needs to without saying anything it doesn't. Indeed, without saying much at all.From there we have a few minutes of calm, establishing an ordinary family on a foray into a foreign country for work, subtle hints that something might be wrong but presented so mundanely that the characters' annoyed but not alarmed reactions are perfect, and then in a sudden, stunningly delivered moment, the entire world turns upside down.The film's pacing is perfect. It wastes no time without feeling rushed at the beginning, and once things start to happen it takes off at a break-neck speed, but every time you're about to lose your mind from the intensity of it there's a pause, just long enough to catch your breath before it takes off again. The action/violence is shocking without being graphic. The stakes are constantly being raised and reset, and everything is presented so realistically that there is a constant sense of mortal peril. Every scene contains multiple surprises, and none of them are cliched.As I said before, the film is beautifully shot. I'm amazed this didn't win awards for the cinematography. The soundscape perfectly compliments both the cinematography and the action. There are so many subtle touches that add so much to it. I could go on, but I'll leave it with just one more thing. This is probably the most intense film I've ever seen. You will be on the edge of your seat with a hand clasped over your mouth or your jaw hanging open most of the film. It's not cheap jump scares or crazy special effects, in fact there are essentially none of either. It's just realistic, dramatic, incredibly tense film making.",No Escape

I'm glad to see Owen taking up a new kind of role, but there is unfortunately one place, perhaps you will observe it he couldn't resist trying to be the clown and it really detracts from the entire movie.Looking on the bright side ? At least Ben Affleck WASN'T in this movie.Motto? Don't go to foreign countries and cheat the people out of their water supplies, they will get quite angry and when their families are pushed to the wall for survival ? they probably will start taking shots at the corporations that caused such perturbations to said local natives.I'd skip this one, and just go read the recently reconstructed declassified documents showing Allen Dulles's tactics on staging fake riots, fake protests, fake newspaper articles attacking Mossadegh, in fact, it's pretty amazing at what Dulles managed TO do in Iran in 1954, can only make one wonder what a mouthpiece like Fox News in the right hands could to these days- speaking of corporations that exploit people.",No Escape

152,Sidd_The_Movie_Slayer,There's No Escape From This Movie,4,29 August 2015,"No Escape is directed and written by John Erik Dowdle. It stars Owen Wilson, Pierce Brosnan, and Lake Bell.No escape revolves around a business man and his family's move to Thailand. Prior to this move Jack Dwyer(Owen Wilson) is offered a job in Thailand that he simply can't refuse. This leads him to move his entire family there. Soon there after a riot breaks out and the rioters plan to kill any and all foreigners. Now Jack must find a safe haven for him and his family before they to are are hunted down with no escape. No escape is an all-around popcorn flick. That is the fact that must be examined while reviewing this movie. What I mean by this is I didn't have any expectation of an Oscar winner going into this movie. i was looking for a thrilling and energetic movie. Did I get one? Not really.I'm not saying No Escape was a terrible movie there were quite a few positives. For one Owen Wilson gives it his all and for the most part his portrayal of Jack Dwyer is very entertaining. Another good performance was that of Pierce Brosnan. He was mostly the comic relief of the movie and succeeded at that. Kudos to you Mr. Bond. I enjoyed the first half of the movie a lot. There was a genuine feeling of dread and some great shots. The cinematography was excellent and gave the film a dark and malicious vibe. The score played perfectly with the cinematography adding some serious suspense. I think the thing I liked most in the first half of the movie is that Owen Wilson was a normal guy not some secret spy trained in acrobatic espionage. The first half of the movie made him vulnerable and that's why it works so well.Onto the negatives. I absolutely despised the kids. The younger one was more tolerable seeing that in a situation like that someone that young would react that way. But the 11 year old was the worst. She had to be carried everywhere and was an all-round nuisance to not only her parents but to the audience as well. Equally annoying if not more was the constantly crying Lake Bell in her portrayal of Annie Dwyer. With three central characters this irritating its hard to sympathize. The biggest negative for me was the entire second half. The movie's shaky cam rises as does the utterly unbelievable plot developments especially someone's second coming. The film tries to add depth to the rioters by giving them a half baked motivation touched upon through 4 sentences given nearing the end. It, as expected, fails due to Dowdle's unwillingness to show Americans in a bad light. I think one of the final nails in this inescapable coffin is the fact that somehow in the course of 6 hours Owen Wilson is pulling of Liam Neason level moves. But, the single worst part about the movie was the ending. It was so far fetched and unbelievable that people in my theater left before the credits started rolling. The ending relied on an inside joke that no one really cared about in the first place. Just plain bad.I had fun with the first half of No Escape and painfully sat through the second half. I recommend seeing this movie and leaving around the 50 minute mark. Make up your own ending I guarantee it'll be better that the one actually put to the film. No Escape gets a C or a 4/10.

154,JohnnyWeissmuller,No Escape,5,25 October 2015,"Directed by John Erick Dowdle, whose only other film I've seen is the humdrum 2014 horror, As Above, So Below, this dim-witted action film finds Owen Wilson, along with his wife and two young girls, trapped in the middle of a civil uprising somewhere in the far east. That somewhere looks like Thailand, but it's a fictional state that finds its population enraged at the way its government has made a deal with an American water company to pump clean water. Their new executive being no other than Owen Wilson, who is caught in the middle of a battle between the police and the militia. The police - or any officials - are never seen again, as Wilson and his family must run the gauntlet to escape their hotel, flee down alley ways and find some good fortune along the way. Other than getting some help from Pierce Brosnan's British agent, who turns up at various moments throughout the film to bring the action and some comic relief. Bronson, who I like very much, lays it on just too thick here, unfortunately. But such is the tone of a movie that's quite intense in its quieter moments, but intermittently stupid and badly staged at key moments. The pacing is brisk and the sound mixing helped create added intensity, but the one dimensional civilian army who are hunting Wilson and his family are about as well defined as the Indians in 1930s westerns. Thankfully, Wilson isn't transformed into a superhero, and he plays his role as a father who is scared for his children and completely out of his depth, quite well. Lake Bell, who plays his wife, is more passive, and has a bit of a thankless role because of that.

This movie in my mind is one of the best if not the best film of the year. Brief summary: a family that moves to China is suddenly caught in a riot of terrorists who aren't as you can imagine too fond of Americans (nor their own people apparently) and brutal murders begin happening in and around their hotel.Under fire and with limited time to escape the hotel the mother jumps to the next roof top and the father is forced to throw each child to her. My god I had tears and I don't even have children! It was by far the most intense scene I have ever seen in a movie hands down. The sickening thought of the children not making it to the other side is just heart pounding and intense. In fact as soon as you see those masked men heading toward the police at the start of it you just know it's going to be awful and violent as riots always are.I have to say I loved Peirce Bronson's character and ""Kenny Rogers"". If you've ever seen Big Trouble in little China, for some reason they reminded me of Jack Burton and his friend in the movie which gave brief moments of humor to the movie. Owen Wilson and Lake Bell are absolutely phenomenal as husband and wife and each is at the top of their game.

160,brendandevere,An Old Fashioned Action Thriller.,8,6 November 2015,"With a very limited release and bad reviews, I wasn't expecting anything outstanding from this film. It took some intense and considerable research to find a screening of 'No Escape' and once I arrived, the box office didn't even know about the movie when I asked for a ticket. ""You want a ticket to what???"", said the young fella behind the counter. My worst fears were on the brink of being realised and after a moment of doubt, I came to the understanding that I was about to watch a car wreck. I sat down to an empty cinema, tried to relax and waited for the catastrophic film to unravel in front of me.'No Escape' shocked me. It was no car wreck. 'No Escape' is a good old fashioned action thriller that moves along at a rapid pace, not allowing the audience a chance to catch their breathe whilst keeping everyone on the edge of their seats.John Erick Dowdle ( Devil, Quarantine), has asked the question, what if???, and the result is a non-stop thrilling ride that gains momentum the deeper the story goes. 'No Escape' is violent bordering on confronting but in the context of its narrative it needed to be so it could build up the frightening reality that the films characters found themselves in. Dowdle purposely creates an atmosphere that is uncomfortable for the viewer with many scenes challenging to watch but authentic in their delivery. Past experiences with such mentally disturbing films in 'Devil' and 'Quarantine' has helped Dowdle to cross over to a more conventional genre, allowing him to expand his creativity with a little more freedom.Set in South East Asia, we are introduced to Jack Dwyer (Owen Wilson) and his young family including his wife, Annie (Lake Bell) and two daughters, Lucy and Beeze. Jack has taken them away from the relative comfort of their American lives and brought them to a foreign environment. His employer has opened a middle management position in a big time water company that has taken control of the country's water supply. Jack believes he is there to do good for his new home only to find out that his company's presence is not tolerated by the locals. After a quick and deadly military coup escalates, Jack and his family find that they are a target in this dangerous game. A mysterious British National named Hammond (Pierce Brosnan) becomes a reliable ally to the family, aiding them when the cost of capture is certain death.Dowdle's recruitment of two actors that have made their names in the safe haven of outrageous comedies was a risky gamble that has paid off with both Wilson and Bell relishing the chance to be involved in a genre that they are not commonly attached. Both give compelling performances in roles that have taken them away from their comfort zones. They have been thrust into a world of high stakes life threatening thriller and it is the genuinely frightening circumstances that brings the best out in Wilson and Bell. They look tormented, sound scared and it translates nicely onto the screen. Brosnan slides into his usual role of a clandestine type figure whose motives are unclear but his presence is not annoying. Hammond seems to come along at the right time and is a voice of reason to Jack's naivety.'No Escape' is fun and thrilling. The violence is in your face and the movie speeds along. Some of the scenes are a little far fetched but the scenarios don't become impossible. If you go in thinking this film is going to be a terrible tornado then you will be disappointed. Your eyes will never leave the screen.",No Escape

The emotion here runs deep, your connection to the protagonists (including Brosnan, playing away from his recent straight to digital affair tropes) is so strong.It's not for a lack of the right prodding from the director, either. Things are not subtle, for sure, if you've come to this for a character thriller, please walk away. However, each actor is very well cast and performs to exactly the right level required, and no-one's weirdly disproportionate in terms of their situation. There's a good measure of this with Wilson in the lift near the kick start of when everything begins to go The direction / cinematography does nothing really flashy bar slow-mo, and that's used only sparingly, and only at the right time. The focus for required in this (to direct the viewer) has hints of Gareth Evans, and that is definitely my tiny mind talking, but y'know ... go away ... it's one of my favourite things about this. Sound design is valid, and not overwhelming, which emphasises that this is a normal family, not Bruce Willis' brethren, too.Look, this is actually really good, and I'd heavily recommend anyone watching it.

Don't listen to them! First of all, there's no mention of Thailand as a location, it's a fictitious country for obvious reasons. The location and fictitious country works fine. Secondly, families move to foreign countries ALL THE TIME for work - Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Malaysia, etc... Not everyone's afraid to leave their county, let alone country. Now, on to the movie...I'm tired of sequels, remakes, and movies that have me rolling my eyes with lousy plot lines (""Spectre""), acting, dialogue, etc... I'm a screenwriter which doesn't make me any more intelligent than anyone else, but I'd like to think I'm a little more critical than others if the situation warrants it. What can I possibly criticize this movie for? Giving me a near anxiety attack? From about 10mins in I was on the edge of my seat until the last two minutes. This is one of the most horrific movies out there (if you have a family), and it was all accomplished by 'situation' - not blood and guts. All in all, I'd say this is likely the best movie I've seen in two years, and that's saying a lot - I average two movies a week.

167,lauren0531,SURPRISING!,9,29 April 2020,"I watched No Escape because it looked interesting, and I was curious to see some serious acting from notorious comedians Lake Bell and Wilson. I didn't LOVE Lake Bell before watching this movie, like I love Wilson, but she has stolen my heart after this one! I wasn't expecting much, and when pierce brosnan showed up 5 minutes into the movie, my expectations dropped even more. I was expecting a low-budget laughable attempt at a thrilling action movie. If you don't love Brosnan, don't be discouraged-he does well and is not a lead character at all. If you disliked Bell and/or Wilson prior to watching, you'll like them better after watching. And if you liked them before, you'll love them after!
This movie gives a really honest and genuine portrayal of a REAL family, marriage, having children, and being kind of displaced in a foreign country that you're just moving to with 2 young daughters. All of it is pretty realistic. The parenting is amazing. The acting is amazing! The action is endless, the tension stays high throughout, the time flies. It's a really good watch!!!Short summary but NO spoilers: Wilson, the husband to Bell, is transferred from the US to Asia for work. He, his wife, and his 2 young daughters pack up their life and move to this southeast Asian foreign land. While it is beautiful and exciting, starting over with no friends or family, with language barriers, and the unknown, the viewer can sense the discomfort, confusion, and hesitance this family is feeling.

174,richard-davis-987-676615,A real surprise find - well worth a watch,7,3 November 2015,"NOTE: I've skirted around some of the key thrilling episodes that occur within the film, but I feel I've talked about them without actually giving anything away. I don't think this review requires a spoiler alert!I watched this having heard absolutely nothing about it, and having not even heard of it. I caught the picture of the cover art, and it seemed like it was Wilson and Brosnan, so thought I'd take a look. Right from the off - it had the feel of something everso slightly different from the normal action film fodder. I won't ruin the surprise beginning, and then it cuts to the Wilson based family heading into this unnamed Asian country for a job-move. From almost upon arrival and for the rest of the film, it's something of a thrill ride. I found myself particularly enthralled when Bell was trapped in their hotel room at the beginning of events - something about the acting and the filming really conveyed real fear and this totally hooked me in. It was clear that this was going to be a decent film from this moment on. It has a slightly ""handicam"" film-making quality about it, but in this instance, it absolutely adds to the feel imho. From the hotel rooftop to the adjacent, again, it conveyed real fear. Would you do that with your family? Shocking from a parents point of view, but believable in that you'd have no choice. From a parental perspective - totally shocking and enthralling. My wife happened to walk into the room just at this point, and she was definitely mentally scarred by what she saw! And there it goes on - for me, the only real slight let-downs in the movie are when Brosnan re-finds the family which in such a scenario really isn't likely to have happened, and indeed what Bell does whilst they are hiding in the old man's garden. I don't feel that a mother, protecting her children would have done that. Apart from these small elements of storyline which probably allowed a little too much implausibility, along with just how much difficulty with the local rebels Wilson's character was realistically likely to overcome and deal with, particularly towards the end of the film - even with full adrenalin running were the only small faults. Still, having said all that - I'll be watching this again soon. It was quite a thrill ride and most certainly not wholesome family entertainment. There's some really quite surprisingly graphic scenes of violence, which totally suited the film, but definitely not for young eyes.",No Escape

Couple that with a political turmoil and it becomes a nightmare. Jack Dwyer is an engineer who is moving to an unnamed SE Asian country (most likely Cambodia) for work with his wife Annie and two little girls. On the flight, he befriends Hammond.While staying at a hotel, he notices some things not quite right. The internet connection and the telephones in the hotel are not working. Little does he know, the prime minister of the country is killed in a coup and now the rebels are killing Americans. Jack is outside looking for a newspaper when he is caught in a mob violence against the police. When he finds out the motives of the rebels, he has to go back and protect his family. The movie then follows his struggle to keep himself and his family alive and find a way out of the country.This movie was really intense and edge of the seat thriller. It was pleasantly surprising to see Owen Wilson in a serious role and he acted superbly so I'm looking forward to more such roles from him. He was supported well by Lake Bell, Pierce Brosnan and the two girls who all did a very commendable job. What I liked was the rapport between the family. There were no cheesy dialogs and a few light moments to combat the otherwise gritty nature of the movie. This was one of the few movies where I didn't really mind the hand-held camera work and it seemed to add to the effect.While the movie is going on, you frequently are questioning ""What would I do in this situation?"". Jack is constantly trying to keep ""10 steps ahead"" as he puts it. I would have liked to see more of the reason behind the turmoil (it is explained very briefly) and then also more of a conclusion. A nicer soundtrack would have also worked wonders. Some more explanation behind some of the coincidences, like how Hammond succeeds to find the family in particular situation would have been good.

I didn't pick out many cliché moments, and certain scenarios left me in awe wondering what was going to happen because I couldn't predict what was going to happen. Look one way, it goes the other. The characters were likable and the protagonist family felt like a real family, which made me sympathize for them. I thoroughly enjoyed Pierce Brosnan's role and was pretty disappointed to see him go out, but he made sure he went out with meaning which was good. In saying all that though, I was originally going to rate this film an 8, but the ending I felt was quite sub-standard. It was touching, but it wasn't a good way to conclude an entire film. As a member of the audience, I wanted to see the family return to the United States as a recuperating family slowly recovering from their traumatic experience, Owen Wilson's character to seek a new career path and world wide news coverage on television reciting the mayhem that had just unfolded before finally concluding.

191,guy-372,"I Shut It Off At 40 Minutes, but sadly watched the remainder later.",3,13 December 2015,"I shut this movie off at 40 minutes into it, because of the stupidity of the decisions being made by the characters. Maybe, a man might make those decisions, but he would deserve a ""Darwin Award"" for thankfully removing himself from our gene-pool. I shut it off at the point that after only the first hours of the murderous rampage, the family had found a safe place to hide for the next couple of days, until the craziness would have subsided, at least in their city, and movement would have been much safer, but the father decided that he immediately needed to move the young family across town, alone on the open streets, while the rampage was still in its earliest hours. Although some stupid things had already taken place, that was just far too stupid for me, and made it clear to me that the author and director had NO COMMON SENSE. Prior to this, the Hero had already failed to show common sense, when he ran back and forth between a large police force and a large street gang force that were both marching together for a violent confrontation. He clearly should have ducked into one of the small stores, which were closing their heavy metal garage doors. He saw shooting in the streets and an American executed.Next, the hero made it excitedly back to his family in their 8th floor room, and he whispered excitedly to his wife about what he saw. Unbelievable, what fool would whisper those facts that are immediately life saving!?! Of course, the two daughters saw the hero's agitated and excited behavior, both before and after he entered the room. And what girl would not be more interested in her loving gentle father at such time, than in her immediate desire to swim in the pool!?! Ugh ... NONE! A girl would even be asking her father to join them! But this 10 year old girl immediately goes by herself in a strange hotel down 4 floors and goes swimming alone!?! IN WHOSE WORLD ??? It never would have happened.So, the family makes it to the roof, along with a couple dozen others, a helicopter comes, flown by rebels??? Of course not!!! How many average people know how to fly a helicopter? Zero percent. Of course this one has a rebel with a machine gun in it killing everyone on the roof! Unbelievable! Even more unbelievable is that the hero had previously thought that he should gather his family in the open and take them toward a flying helicopter, which could have only rescued 6 of the 2 or 3 dozen on the roof, and only after it had landed, if it could have.So with escapees being shot by the killers who had made it to the roof, the hero decides that his family must jump to the next building's roof nearby. As the hero is working out how to do this and as the family then do this, another escapee man just stands around watching them for the longest time, not helping and not doing the jump for himself and not trying to escape! Unbelievable! Of course, after the family makes the jump, the man gets shot trying to make the jump. So, the family is now safe on wide walkway ledge behind a large vinyl sign, unseen by anyone, but a tank comes down the street and clearly and specifically targets them on the 7th floor! Unbelievable! The break into the building and get inside, just in time for the tank shell to explode into the building, creating destruction and a hiding place, a large hole among the ruble to which the family escapes to hide, pulling a dead body over the opening to the hole. The killers come in the room, kill a few people, look around the room and leave. Clearly, their hiding place worked and the killers wouldn't find them there, if the killers came back. Obviously, a normal person would keep his family safe in this hole until the street killings have stopped. So, this is the point that the hero decides that they must leave their safe hiding place to travel across town in the open to get to the safety of the embassy, while the killing gangs are still at the beginning of their marauding! I couldn't stand any more stupidity so I shut it off to watch the remainder the next day while doing desk work!!!NO! The movie didn't get any better! It all continued in these unbelievable character choices and freak occurrences ... just like it was a nightmare dream! There is really no other way to really describe it than exactly like the unbelievable occurrences and decisions one makes in a nightmare.The director did make his anti-something statement by having a benevolent rescuing character make a crazy speech about how this blood and carnage was all his and the West's fault for selling infrastructure improvements to undeveloped nations.

Although there are some minor breathers in between, it's an ongoing chase, very intense. The scenario of a putsch in a small Asian country comes across as realistic, and lessons can be learned. In the movie the country remains unnamed, although we know that it has a prime minister and that it borders Vietnam. Therefore it could be referenced to Cambodia or Laos. Fact is that often with unstable governments and extreme poverty in various countries from the continents of Asia and Africa to South America and to the Middle East region, such scenarios have happened many times in the past and are definitely a potential possibility today. It's good to be prepared, ... just in case, and this flick can educate us a bit or at least give us an idea if something like this were to happen to us some day.A few minor plot points don't make too much sense, but it really doesn't matter as it is more about the attempted escape from the predicament the American family (husband and wife and two children) find themselves in. The coincidence that the location is set near the border of Vietnam makes certain things a bit more convenient, because if the revolution would have taken place in the interior of the country, an attempted escape may have encountered even more obstacles.",No Escape

The director's previous outing ""As above so below"" is indeed a decent flick. Come to talk about ""No Escape"", the build up of the tension was very neat. Owen did give me a surprise to be proving himself as a actor in a film which has absolutely no comedy what so ever except for some humorous moments along the line. And as for Pierce, I did expect to see a much of Pierce and his actions in the film but I was a bit disappointed on that note, other than that he does his usual style of roles. Once the film's turning point reaches, the build up of the tensions with slow motion visual had a nice touch to it but nothing new to what we haven't already seen.

So, the storyline itself could have been much better, but as a movie, this poor, unbelievable, overly predictable storyline becomes a work of art.

Casting Mr. Wilson in a 'hero' mantle was the first mistake made. There is no effort to develop his character, and everything he does is wooden and one-dimensional.Similarly the screen presence of his wife and children (I don't know how children can be easily able to elicit the shock and horror that the setting of the film demanded but, for me, it wasn't there) Similarly, the presence of Pierce Brosnan in what is clearly a 'B- Film' is a further demonstration of how far his acting credentials have fallen.I note, with displeasure, that many of the 'liberal luvvie' film reviewers have accused the film-makers of xenophobia, since, in their opinion, the Asian actors are seen to be either mentally challenged or militant thugs. Perhaps their confusion stems from the film indicating that the latter group shot, or otherwise killed, all the 'normal' Asians.This movie reportedly cost about $5 million to make, and has currently earned a global total of some $54 million at the box office. The moral is that cinema goers will pay good money to watch a garbage movie, as long as their is plenty of blood and guts on display, so I am sure that other film producers are taking note and planning similar'blockbusters'.",No Escape

This movie ruined all that.It's set in a place in Asia...probably a place thought up by someone who has never been to Asia, I mean, it kinda looks like it could be Cambodia or Thailand or Bali....but I've never been to any of those places so I can't really say how authentic it truly is. But I don't care about how authentically Asian it is...it's just a movie after all.The plot is this: American family moves to Asia for work. A big military coup occurs and all westerners, but especially Americans, are targeted for immediate execution. American family must flee in a dangerous and unfamiliar city whilst coming so close to death that they'll clearly need therapy for decades.The acting. Nothing special really. I generally like Brosnon, I find Wilson generally likable...but really the acting seems secondary to the backdrop. Character development isn't really necessary in a movie like this...because it's an action thriller....and it has action thrills in spades.Is it good?Well, depends. If you want something with as much grit as the best Robert De Niro movies have, you won't find it here. In fact, if you're looking for something that'll change how you think or challenge your ideas or tell you something you didn't already know you'll be rather saddened to hear that this movie isn't for you......but, if you want to not really think about authenticity, are happy to ignore some fairly 2 dimensional baddies and some pretty regular thriller twists, and don't mind a movie being a bit obvious, you might find this movie to be a good bit of fun.I've seen other reviewers talk about the racism in this movie, saying how all the ""brown people"" want to kill all the ""white people"", this seems an odd thing to complain about in my opinion, after all, it's set in Southeast Asia, you'd expect most people in the movie to be from Southeast Asia, you'd expect a military coup to be carried out by southeast Asians, but some people have trouble looking past fictional bubblegum movies.In summery, this film won't win any awards, it won't really challenge you, but it will let you sit back with a beer and enjoy a few minutes of edge of your seat madness in an nondescript hellhole that wants to kill all Americans....and Brosnon too....and a number of southeast Asians.Basically, it's alright but it's not fantastic.",No Escape

Do we really need more Americans viewing foreigners, anyone not Western, with distrust and fear? Discrimination is bad enough in the U.S. Despite a pretty good movie it is hard to suspend disbelief when it comes to the initial stupidity shown by the main character - who travels to a country without learning where they are going? Who doesn't at least attempt to learn a few words of the language of the country they are in?

With no popcorn for support I had to endure a fast paced, gruesome, rebel riots in a foreign country. The one thought that kept running through my mind was 'What would I do if this happened to me?' No Escape is about a family that had moved to new waters for better job prospects. Within hours of landing they find themselves in a middle of a rebel coup. Merciless killings of any foreigners - especially Americans. Owen Wilson ridden with guilt will do anything to protect his family, and so the action begins....slightly far-fetched, but bearable. Both lead actors Owen Wilson and Lake Bell showed great strength as the focus was on them throughout the whole film. I think the intention was good to portray the difficulties foreigners would have if ever in a situation of No Escape but once again the political question rises about America v Rest of the World. 'You made your bed, so you can lay in it!' The image 'White family being attacked by brown crazy people' - Heroic v Madness....issues that are being faced by the rest of the world as we are safe and sound in our homes.

237,sekula32,"No Escape is your regularly served escape from daily life, in a form of mindless blockbuster flick.",6,16 November 2015,"I'll start with last scene or shot, before opening credits. We see a man, bodyguard of a Unspecified Foreign Place's leader, trapped, with all people around him dead, and plenty of killers ahead of him. He sees no exit, grabs knife, and decides to kill himself. Next we see title of a film, ""No Escape"", for which first scene was thrown into film, because it would be cool to make that parallel, I guess. Later on, as usual, it starts with American family going on vacation in foreign country, this time in unnamed Asian country. After first twenty minutes or so, we see our leading guy, right into city square, where two large groups of people, cops and probably revolutioners, suddenly appear facing each other and killing each other. Adventure of our hero starts. I couldn't but not think of title of film, and scene I talked about in beginning. Asian guy couldn't find escape, and killed himself. Something tells me that our leading guy, will ""beat the title"", and somehow find escape, to say it like that, by the end of the film.We from then, start to follow his adventure and root for him. Because that's what large amount of people wants to see; this guy, escaping this situation, with his family alive. So, we mostly follow situations from his eyes, from men who is destined to be regular American hero in this kind of film. After few intense scenes in hotel, family we follow and other people, seemed to currently found their escape on the roof of the building. Helicopter arrives, on their misfortune bad guys are in it, and later on, helicopter crashes, and chaos reigns. Because it obviously had to fall down, or film would be over by now. While we follow them trying to find way out, group of bad guy reaches the roof, and while it would took them less than a minute to find everyone, and kill others, we instead next fifteen minutes watch our hero's plan to jump to other building. After much is said and done, he forces his daughter to jump, and after they manage to do that, Asian guy, who was with them, gets killed just before he was to make another step and jump. Well, who hasn't seen that coming?!Just before the end, our hero gets caught, and in the new situation, in which again seems not to be escape for him, because two people are holding him, and other guy is holding his daughter and gun pointed towards him, and of course won't kill him right away, we see clichéd situation of his wife suddenly appearing, punching that one guy, and saving the day. It's no problem later to just get rid of those other two. It's really a manipulative scene, to say the least. Film ends with classical scene of them after all is over, and we can easily continue our daily habits, and not think about it any more.Having said all of this, I'll move myself and talk a bit about term ""Guilty pleasure"". You see, I understand people saying they don't have ones, because they don't find themselves guilty for liking some film. To some extent, I agree with that. But, here is the film, in its screenplay so full of stuff I dislike being done in blockbusters, yet despite all of that, I found myself enjoying pretty much whole film. So why I wrote all that stuff above... Well, because I simply don't think it's a good film, aside from some nice direction, which is really intense and brutal at times, but melodramatic and manipulative at others; and surprisingly good performance from Owen Wilson, and enjoyable presence of Pierce Brosnan. Some nice editing and pacing here and there, as well as pretty amazing camera work. But I can't say I didn't found film completely offensive at times, and I picked few scenes above to explain why and when. Bad guys fall into the cliché that Asians are villains or victims do not deserve the second of credibility. They're used as cheap villains and never get second of empathy. Villains portrayal may be either be seen as poor characterization of bad guys, or just racist. Whatever intentions were, they are still seen as group of Asians who decided all white men must die, for reasons no one knows. There isn't explanation why are they killing all foreigners, except that they're bad. There is literally one line explaining situation, which is told in sardonic way. But of course, we only got to see our hero's perspective of things. Again, title is so lazy, because there is escape, for our hero and his family, why? Because script requires that.I'll give it six stars on here, which clearly is really high after everything I wrote, but even if my review doesn't seem like it, I am in a good mood and feeling generous about this film, and I want to show that when you're writing review, rating doesn't really mean that much, because I would no have problem rating this much more lower.",No Escape

About midway through the film, the character played by Pierce Brosnan speaks for about twenty seconds straight, right in the middle of a perilous situation, and seems to blame most of the area's turmoil on the devious plots of multinational corporations.

It takes a while to get used to seeing Owen Wilson in a serious role but he does it pretty well. However, the film can't seem to quite make up its mind as to whether it is a genuine serious thriller or one with a slight comedy angle to it. Pierce Brosnan seems totally out of sync with the rest of the film as does his taxi driver friend who are almost comedy characters in what otherwise is a very intense, violent, serious film. There are some slightly ridiculous moments such as throwing their children off a roof onto another one, the film makers should have made it a little less impossible to give the film a bit more realism and shooting a man up a tower with a small pistol from miles away which is a virtually impossible shot but that shouldn't detract from what is a highly entertaining intense film although won't do much for the tourist trade to Asia.

241,laulumaa,Wilson and action do not match,4,6 November 2015,"I agree with most of the critics. This movie is some how false from the beginning. The acting is bad ,the plot is not at all convincing and good old James Bond Bosnan is dropped down in the places where the script needs a divine intervention. Most of the movie I was expecting something to happen which would look like a plausible action according to the happenings, but no, I was feeling shame for the actors and the writers and of course the director. The role and acting and whining of the children was so bad that I hoped that they would be killed as soon as possible to perhaps turning this movie to something better. This was probably made for American audience, as a Finn I feel this was something I would not recommend to anyone, in Europe we still have some taste.

242,eyigit,Shouldn't have been produced by Americans,6,19 June 2017,"The movie starts really great and intense! My wife and me felt the realism in this movie until one point... (SPOILER ALERT!) The two children's behavior was stupid all the time. Men shooting around and blood everywhere, but the little girl cries out for her plush figure. Then, later in the movie, they did not seem shocked or paralyzed all the time - for me this is not realistic. The worst thing in the movie was that they wanted the American family to survive and be heroic so bad that it became nearly funny in a bad way. I mean they try to kill Owen Wilson's character all the time, shoot with a tank, etc. and then they finally got him and instead of shooting him they wait until the little daughter comes up. And then of course, the BAD Asians want go get some satisfaction with forcing the little girl to kill her dad. Come on Hollywood, what the f.... is this? Oh wait, they did that so the wife and the little daughter can help them and stop and beat the 4-5 armed bad guys who then wait until the family crosses the boarder to Vietnam...You see, I loved the first 80-90% of the movie so much that I am really angry about how it ended up.This is why I gave only 6 points instead of 9. The forced happy ending ruined the movie.As an example: I love Sons of Anarchy and the creator said once ""i cannot imagine how this story could end in a good way"" or something equivalent.

243,gofloatbali,A surprisingly good action-thriller,7,26 June 2020,"I think critics had to bash this movie for the sake of being politically correct. Stupidly so.
I do find that they could have done a bit better in fleshing out the political plot at the background but the message is fine. The plot is based on a grounded fear. The movie doesnt set out to get deep in to it but doesnt claim to do that either. The movie uses it as a device.It wants to be a very suspenseful ride with a feel of realism and it totally succeeds. A few issues keeps it from being fantastic, but it is still surprisingly good.
The movie's plot gets driven by a situation more so then by a story. The downside might be a lack of depth, but it does serve the way you get sucked in the action and suspense of survival.
There is something not Hollywood about how things go down which also adds to the suspense. You are not sure if it gets an all happy ending. Another positive note I have about the violence in the movie. It is not celebrating violence or going for shockvalue. Something many a moviemaker would not stir around. (the scene of daughter having to shoot her dad was a bit to much though)I do find that the maincharacters where slightly flat, despite being well acted and believable through out. The characters were, lets say, not people I often hang out with. What made them relatable nevertheless was being a parent of two little kids. I am myself an expat in South East Asia with two little boys!
Owen Wilson did great playing a very regular guy doing extremely well in defending his family without turning in to a super hero. Lake Bell was fine; her character wasnt very sexy but not meant to be. The movie shows a somewhat struggeling marriage before all hell brakes lose.
Special credits to the two young actresses, Sterling Jerins and Clair Geare. Child- actors can put a movie down, these girls certainly did not. Pierce Brosnan did wel as a side-character. (did seem a bit like an alcoholic James Bond that just went rock bottom) One could argue he wasnt in it enough, but it made sense as we really need to be with the family in order to make it work. Another side-character was played by S. Boonthanakit. His character was a bit cheaply played as comic relief in my opinion. On the other hand; its a type I can imagine being your driver in Thaland-ish country.I do have a bit of an issue with the climax. It felt rushed. And the closing-shot felt forced, the ending was happy enough without it.Other than those few issues the movie is a well above average suspenseful thriller with an interesting cinematography. The poor scores it got from many critics do not make sense.

Yes the child actors are pretty annoying, but who REALLY knows how a couple white kids in a situation like this would honestly act?

It's even worse than most critics are saying. Disturbingly violent at times, the movie lacks any kind of perspective, both literally and figuratively!Yep! The filmmakers use a awful lot of close-up and hand held camera, which makes me feel nauseous. Even in quieter moments, the damn camera keeps shaking. I understand that this is meant to overstate a certain level of paranoia and a sense of stress. But you almost never get to see a wide or mid shot of any action, and when the camera finally stops it sea-sick movement, it's a relief.As for any perspective on the reasons behind the coup d'etat, or any type on context...well this is not this type of movie.

249,vassago26_98,Compelled to review out of respect for an outstanding film,9,31 August 2015,"I am the type that always takes a look at IMDb and the scores there before I go out and lay down cash on a film. I am a major film lover, and I also work in the industry. I watch a film a week at the theater and I am likely half made of popcorn by now. I gave this film a 9 out of 10, but I don't think I would give any film I have ever seen a perfect score. This film was a week ago rated lower here in terms of score, and that influenced me not to give it a try. However the premise of the film - a young American family trapped in the middle of a coup and uprising, was very interesting. I came back yesterday and saw the score had gone up and some people were giving it good reviews. I gave it a try and was surprised to say this is one of the better films I have seen in a while. My wife is Filipina, and I have been to her home town many times in the lower income parts of Das Marinas, Cavite. This film was so close to home in terms of how it realistically portrays the normal parts of life of traveling through various parts of Asia as a foreigner. My wife, who was watching with me, kept getting very emotional throughout the film. It is a roller-coaster of a film with intensity that I have not felt in a movie theater in a long time. I have 4 kids, and this movie taps right into the primary need to protect those children at all costs. This is not a film for weak stomachs, although it is not to gory. It is more about the hard feelings and emotions you will need to endure to get through to the end. Until the very end you are not sure if the family will make it.

I couldn't finish sitting through this trash, the stupidity of the main character(s) was just too frustrating to watch. Wilson's character is too stupid to take 5 seconds to Google the company he works for or the country he's been sent to in order to avoid risking his family's life taking some crappy ""middle management"" job in a third world toilet in the middle of a revolution that his company is at least partly responsible for. Seriously, an engineer couldn't find a job in North America? Of course the wife is just as stupid for not doing any research at all and not only going along, but allowing her children to be taken to said crap-hole.

Maybe I'm just starved for competent films these days so I over react to good ones, but honestly, I can't think of any major flaw--Good character development, chaotic story and action well played.This had a great amount of intense suspense, drama, action, unbearable situations, and you are fully immersed into the chaos so that you feel you are part of the family who is trying to escape and constantly thinking along with the characters about what to do next.The scene where Wilson's character, then later, his wife's character, respectively, are forced to kill for the first time to survive and help their children survive, are really gut-wrenching scenes, as you can see their horror of committing the act, but also can't help but identify and agree it was their only course of action.There is a lot of brutality in this film with merciless terrorist bad guys killing at will . . . so definitely avoid this film if that sort of gruesomeness bothers you.Hat's off to the writers, directors, and actors, especially Wilson and Bell.Well done.",No Escape
253,nrwalke,"A Passable Action Film, Until You Think About It",6,18 November 2015,"Let's get the good out of the way first. Owen Wilson does a pretty good job, as does Lake Bell as the mother. The kids weren't overly annoying. And it was genuinely thrilling throughout. There was great buildup of tension, and the end was sufficient. That's why I gave it a 6.The trouble comes when you start to realize exactly what is causing the tension in the film. Wilson's character is an engineer for a mega-corporation, something to do with the water supply. What exactly isn't ever specified, except that Wilson had no idea what his superiors had planned (more on this point in a second). Pierce Brosnan is in the film as well, doing a weird Scottish-Australian accent and playing a ""British-CIA-type guy"". Direct Owen Wilson quote there, he can't seem to keep all the nice guy out of him.Anyway, the thing that bothered me was that all the violence we actively see is against the people of whatever country this is (not specified, but shares a major city on the border of Vietnam?). A coup attempt goes on shortly after Wilson's family arrives. The coup-folk are killing foreigners, specifically Americans. They chant ""Blood for Water!"" while Wilson's family is hiding on the roof of their hotel, and everyone acts like this makes perfect sense. While we see some dead Americans/Brits, most of the actual violence is against the people of the country. This movie uses people as set pieces.And it does that weird thing where it bases fiction too much on real life, even if this isn't actually based on a true story.Later in the film, Brosnan yadda yaddas something about how ""we did this,"" ""our countrymen."" Then he dies (in what is, to be honest, a fairly sweet death). The problem is that the reason is half-baked. Why would these people be OK killing their own countrymen to kill a few Americans? I can see something like embassy employees, but why employees at a major hotel? I don't know, it seemed a little off to me.And how does Wilson's character not know at all what they're doing? He's some kind of engineer with a kind-of anti-corporate stance (he's been forced to work for them after they drove him out of business; he ""invented a valve"" but it wasn't enough to stay independent), but he acts like the thought of Western interests in Asia might violently protect himself. Did he fall asleep in US history? Did he miss the giant ""VIETNAM"" sign at the border? How'd that war go for us? I don't get Owen's doubt. Did he not research the company he works for at all? He comes across as an idiot, but he's so gosh-dang likable. It's hard not to root for him.Actually, the kids were kind of annoying at first, now that I think about it. Once they learned to shut up, the movie kind of forgot about them until a big emotional moment was needed. Eh. Nobody ever does kids right.Final verdict: If you don't think about it at all, and are feeling like the American white guy should be the focus of a movie about a Asian coup (and Owen Wilson, at that), turn off your brain and watch this movie.

Yes, this situation has been done a zillion times before (for example, THREE ""Taken"" movies) -- but I've never seen it done with this much intensity. The movie's focus was not on the ""action."" Rather, the focus was on the interplay between the parents/kids, how they dealt with each other and the various situations, providing a deeply human touch against a horrifically inhuman background (a massacre). And it was this extreme contrast, of the human vs the inhuman, that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the movie.Pierce Brosnan was also amazing. No plastic Kennie doll here -- Pierce Brosnan played an imperfect man trying to do the right thing. I've never seen Pierce Brosnan play such a wide range within a single role -- from off-key karaoke to ____.

The single best thing about this film is pierce Brosnan he is an absolute bad ass in this film and he is also funny as heck in this movie he is definitely the Liam Nelson of this film and that's a very good thing if you are a fan of his you will enjoy this one for sure. Owen Wilson was not bad in this film but they try to perceive him as a bad ass like Brosnan and fail miserably the scene where he beats the guy with a lamp was very brutal and bloody but all it really was the character just trying to protect his family and that's what this movie is really about survival. At the beginning of this film the leader of a Thailand country is slain and a revolt is started millions of citizens of the country are killed mercilessly and Owen Wilson's character and his family get caught in the middle of all of it basically it's taken accept without the kidnapping aspect. The problems in this movie stem from the fact that if this happened in real life this family in the movie would literally be dead they would not have survived any of it particularly the two little girls they were so incredibly stupid especially the older one the fact that she's swimming at the beginning of the movie completely ignorant of what's going on around her I mean how do you not hear the bullets. But anyway like I said this was not a bad movie but if it had not had pierce Brosnan in it thus movie would have been direct to DVD garbage lake bell playing the typical damsel in distress and Owen Wilson trying to play the meek man turned bad ass just would have been unbearable without the comic relief and badassry of pierce brosnan overall an okay b movie thriller 6/10 which I think is fair for a film like this not terrible but my advice wait to watch this one on Netflix.,No Escape

It was well worth the money I spent for the shear entertainment value. their was a little bit of a message in it straight from the book "" Confessions of an economic Hit-man"" that are true, people think that the United States is giving money away to foreign countries when all we are really doing is enslaving them to our corporate benefit,",No Escape

Owen Wilson and Pierce Brosnan were the two headline stars I usually enjoy watching. Although there weren't grotesque violence displayed, there was a little too much non-stop senseless violence. When a country is over-run by a majority rebellion and foreigners and sympathizers are summarily executed with guns and machetes, you can only watch so much of that. But that's what you get from 20 minutes into the movie on. So the whole theater seemed tense after the initial bits of comedy. Pierce did a good job, so did Owen. But I almost get a sense that people who look Malaysian / Cambodian / Vietnamese / Laotian will get a negative stereotype with this movie.

Usually if there is a revolution or coup the military takes over. Not revolutionaries. The whole premise is strange. I would think if the revolutionaries had taken over then they would be bracing to meet the military not chasing an American family through the streets just to kill them. Stupid. Think back to how many coups there have been. What percentage were taken over by generals? Thailand, Burma, South Vietnam, Argentina, Chile, just to mention a few.

283,kevinheroes0504,Review from a Vietnamese: Good movie but just no there yet,7,3 November 2015,"No Escape has me on the edge of my seat for several moments. The intensity of the movie is real. Well done producer, but you still miss the shot by that much. The story is about Jack Dwyer and his families traveling to a South East Asian movie to settle down so he can work for a water company there. However, they soon find out that a coup has broken out and local rebels are trying to kill all foreigners they see because those foreigners are making them slave by control the water sources. Jack has to walk through hell, fight off enemies to escape to Vietnam. Cool, really good plot. However, it can be much better. I want to know better about the villain, not just mindless criminals. I want a bit of side story and explanation. Although Mr.Hammond did explain a bit, I feel that detail is just too shallow and it is not developed good enough. I feel that bit is not necessary, a normal coup for power is fine for me. Don't mark everything America with star, stripes and eagle.The movie also has several errors. Such as when Annie told her daughter to hide in the bathroom and lock, she ran the opposite direction in the bedroom, but later the wife was standing in front of the bathroom next to the main door (hotel, 1 bathroom only).Also when the sniper try to kill them, Hammond and Kenny did a terrible job on keeping an eyes out. Moreover, if I am a rebel and I know they are staying up there, I will send several men to get them right there, not just staying in the tower and shoot. That is a terrible strategy. Hammond was really cool character, but he does not have enough screen time, which is a total let down. The ending scene was not well played, I feel it rushes too much and I feel they take only 5 minutes to get to Vietnam border. And the truck was chasing, if they planned to kill, why don't they just shoot when the boat still on the other side? What hold them back? I would prefer the ending scene on a road than the river. As I want to see a bit more standoff between Vietnamese force and rebels. LIKE: Good plot Decent Acting Good ""South East Asian"" Atmosphere Hammond Intensity and violence Vietnam is safe havenDISLIKE: Plot was not well developed in side story Movie errors and nonsense Screen time for Hammond was not enough Ending sceneOTHER STUFF FOR DISCUSSION: OK, the country in the movie, is not real. So calm down guys. It was filmed in Thailand, people speaking Laotian and minority languages and all the signs are in ""up side down"" Cambodian Khmer. It is a movie okay? There is no country's city has direct fly from US and couple of miles away from Vietnam, of course.I personally like this movie, it reflects partly the truth of several South East Asian countries now. Cambodia is going through big political war between the current gov and the politicians who want to wage a war with Vietnam. Thing was really tense at Vietnam's border couple of months ago. I saw someone rated this movie bad and said it is a racist movie because white people escapes. Calm the f*ck down, it is an action movie, not a lovely soft humane story.

It was entertaining and had a good pace; the action starts quickly and the ending doesn't drag either. It isn't the typical action/thriller. There are chases and explosions, but Owen Wilson's character isn't trying to be a hero--at one point his escape vehicle is a moped, and he doesn't touch a gun for most of the movie. Some reviews have called it xenophobic, and I can understand that argument but that wasn't how I was watching the movie.

It isn't one of those movies that will be spoken about for years too come, but we must give credit where it is needed.No Escape is a gripping, intense, cleverly put together movie. From the beginning the movie sets us up with the motives of why the family is moving and you feel connected with the main character Jack (Owen Wilson)who just wants to do whats best for his family. Seeing and loving, Owen Wilson is more comedic roles i didn't know how he would fair up is this action pact thriller, but i must admit, there may be a new genre around the corner and maybe another huge turning point in his career, sending him among the greats.The film's writers have a lot to do with the success of this film, its script never dumbs down for the viewers, it is a script of what people would actually say and conversations that would actually happen in this situation. It makes you feel for the characters in the film and helps you to understand what is going on. You will feel apart of it. it cleverly leaves out all of the irrelevant details, keeping viewers guessing about what will happen next and how they will get out of a very sticky situation, while the mayhem continues around our main characters.No Escape hits the ground running and never takes its foot off of the gas petal. Tensions are high and there is moments when you question how they are going to get out of an outrageously dangerous, near impossible situation. But it is not a movie where you feel as though the main character will survive no matter what. There are times where his death looks likely.No Escape is a strong emotional and physical battle for survival and will have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.7.5/10A must see, and a vastly underrated movie.",No Escape

I have seen him take on a serious role before in behind enemy lines so i knew he had it in him but he really takes it to a whole new level here. the children are adorable and really strong actresses for their age. the family dynamic is authentic and you genuinely care about what happens to them.the concept behind this movie is not too far fetched and felt very plausible. John Erick Dowdle does a great job putting his audience right in the middle of the chaos. Many instances throughout the movie i found myself thinking about how i would react in these situations. Some excellent camera-work is used here too, especially on the roof scene.Of course this movie is not perfect. there were a couple of Hollywood moments where someone saves the day at the last possible second and the ending felt kind of abrupt but it was still pretty emotional and shows what this family has gone through. overall i give this movie a 9.5/10Do not sleep on this movie. you will be in for one wild ride.",No Escape

They start a seemingly ideal life that's being interrupted by angry mobs and bloodthirsty revenge. Some scenes are really obscene and seemingly ridiculous. But the way children portrayed disappointments, fears and unpleasant experiences is amazing. Maybe even better than the adults. But honestly, Jack Wilson's interpretation is simply unconvincing, lacking charisma, passion and those damnable desire for the salvation of the family that would make the existing situation should react. Also, it should be noted that the role of Hammond who went to Pierce Brosnan from the beginning was suspicious. Solo man, a fan of karaoke, in his 50s, with numerous scars, feels at home in this ""No Name"" country - something's gotta be strange! Of course, he is the only salvation for the Dweyers.

For Pete's flippin' sake, people, here we have a ""white"" family (also known as typical Americans) going to an Asian country where they are targeted by ""brown/yellow"" people (who typically live in Asian countries), albeit militant extremists. (Which is not so uncommon. Anyone remember Tiananmen Square??) I guess we should all be making movies about the Whos in Whoville so nobody gets their feelings hurt?

Who cares that it's not spot on as far as actual map points or that Owen's character or his wife, before boarding the plane, didn't Google everything from what the foreign activists were brewing over to how they milk their cows (<-- per complaints in other reviews). That hardly matters when Jack Everyman is running for his life in a foreign country. It's a movie, after all. Sheesh.This movie is RIVETING. I found it entirely plausible, terribly graphic, palpably frightening, excellently acted, directed, and edited, and heart-pumping from start to finish . . . relatively. Minimal overt Hollywood cheese, and it is rare to find such excellent talent and acting skills in such young actors like these little girls.Owen Wilson is in everyone's face with an Oscar-worthy ""Who Says I Can't Do Drama?"" performance, Lane Bell does a remarkable job, Pierce Brosnan is great for some (much needed!) ""comic"" relief, and all the way around, the movie is intense, gripping, quite believable, and it continually sucks you in. We had to keep pausing every once in a while just to calm ourselves down (and remind ourselves it was just a movie). One of the most captivating and engaging movies I've seen in a long time. Very, very well done! Graphic, edgy, and not for the thin-skinned, but it puts one in touch with reality as to some of the tragic ""ethnic cleansing"" this world has seen.

If you are a parent, you will appreciate it a little more as your paternal instincts sympathise with their plight.They tried to show considerable realism in the movie, however I have one major gripe that I feel was done due to the backlash of American Sniper and it's accusation of being anti-Muslim, and ironically, some critics have now branded this movie as being ""Racist"". The movie is based in either Cambodia or Laos (the only 2 plausible countries) and turns the natives into barbaric butchers just like ISIS fighters for no plausible reason, not like a religious ideology would.

I have traveled most of Asia, I have met the kindest people in the world over there and I find this movie offensive and inappropriate.

John Perkins' non-fiction book ""Confessions of an economic hitman"" feels like it was used to form the basis for the movie script. In Perkins' book, the core and documented claim made is that the US has for decades used a maffia strategy of ripping off smaller countries in Asia, Middle and South America, Middle East, by corrupting local politicians to sign huge infrastructure projects (a water distribution plant, in the movie) that everyone knows the country cannot afford. The international loans ensure the projects get started, but when countries inevitably fail to keep up with repayments, the ""hitmen"" come in to extract their pound of flesh, as Perkins puts it. In the movie, the local population isn't letting it come to that stage, and is rebelling against the corrupt plans to rob the people of their water, to be replaced by a privatised water supply system. The movie is 99% action, but if you keep in mind the political context of this action, it becomes a really strong story.

A no-name ""scary Asian"" country has a coup, and Wilson is stuck trying to get his family out. As soon as he notices there is a coup, which is almost immediately, he is on the run. But it is an absurd, laughable run, one in which bad editing, stupid slow-mo, and ridiculous music do not enhance a bad writing job.

Not only do Owen Wilson, Pierce Brosnan, and Lake Bell do a great job of acting, but the story grabs you early on and won't let go.The story follows a husband (Wilson), wife (Bell), and their two daughters as they head to an unspecified Asian country on a work-related trip. They arrive on the night of a violent coup, which spills over into an anti-American unrest aimed at large corporations stealing jobs from local workers. Soon, the family is on the run for their lives, and once that race starts, it hardly stops for more than a few minutes for us to catch our breath. It's disturbing, and violent, and chilling, and thought-provoking.We have traveled extensively overseas, and we could relate to many of the cultural hurdles that the family faces.

Where most movies nowadays rely on special effects and unrealistic action and superhero powers to capture the viewers, this movie is built on real danger to an innocent family. Having two daughters of my own around the same age as the kids in this film, I found myself profoundly connected to the fathers dilemma throughout. But even if you don't have kids, if you're human you will feel the danger and emotion in this film.This is Owen Wilson's crowning jewel of films, he was perfect in the role of protective father. The kids and wife were fantastic actresses as well. The entire story, though far fetched, was absolutely believable and horrifying. If you want a few hours of action packed drama, this is a great choice. I cannot say enough about the film. No flaws and excellent story telling through film.

The acting of Lake Bell, Pierce Brosnan, and Luke Wilson was first rate. Brosnan's character was very entertaining and I think the movie would have been better if his role was larger. The movies fundamental flaw was its unrealistic characterization of a family from Texas. On three occasions in this movie the stars had an opportunity to get guns to protect their family and all three times they either didn't bother to pick up a gun, or left them behind after using them. I cannot believe that a Texan wouldn't carry a gun to protect his family. This was so out of character that I almost started rooting for the bad guys.There is a standing joke about horror films, where the star has a choice between a gun and a flashlight, and the star chooses the flashlight.

It shouldn't at all be like this backwards. The bloody scratches/scars from the falling and wounds all looked very poorly made, which itself pretty well portrayed the overall quality of the props, scenes, destruction, stunts and the entire movie.

The issues I had with it however had me yelling at the character's actions, especially the kids! I know! I'm spoiled to the post season 2's quick thinking, tenacious and brave Carl Grimes of The Walking Dead! The kids in this movie were just ridiculously frustrating though! Two school age kids in real life would just know better than these character's. Example: in only about 10 minutes in, the family witnesses people being gunned down, they run for their lives as they are chased and fired upon, each choice posing more threats including a tank firing upon the office they are hiding in blowing it to smithereens. So first time they're hiding behind something, Kid #1 ""Daddy tell me that story again..."", Well, this is a perfect time to tell you a story! We have plenty of time. How about Stephen King's "" The Stand""! Kid # 2 "" I'm hungry"". Sure, let's just ask one of those angry murderers if he has a couple of happy meals in his pocket! Another, say 5 minutes maybe, hiding in some rubble from an explosion, Kid #2 ""I have to go potty!"" Now those are just a few examples! I think every school age kid knows ""stranger danger"" and at first these kids just would not listen and shut up whenever a murderous stranger was within earshot! Also what kid doesn't know hide and seek and that the way to win and not to be found was to STFU when hiding! To top it off, the wife was annoying and taking up too much precious time either whining or questioning/defying her husband's quick thinking with ideas and plans when she sure as heck didn't have any of her own, or if she did they would be dead by the time she came up with one!

The little comedy bits that go along with it every once in awhile is a great touch and really brings it together.

The scene was very well done and portrayed a lot of emotion.(LIKED) As Jack and the family tried to find the boat to cross Vietnam, the intensity was building up. I liked the little ""capturing"" that happened and when they arrived at Vietnam the security at the boarder were yelling at the other people and saying if they shoot the family that are in Vietnam territory they will start a war.(DISLIKED) After they crossed Vietnam I was hoping for an extra 10-15 minutes of something with the family, but the only thing we got was them laying in bed sharing the story how one of the daughters were born.

I am so impressed with Owen Wilson, who plays Jack. I believe this is his best performance ever! Not only that but one of the best movies this year! I absolutely feel that the relevance was there in this movie, not only for the present but for the past, in our history with Asia. To be simply put, without spoiling anything, A small amount of info.so you will want to watch this movie. I truly don't want you to miss it! Jack(Owen Wilson) Annie his wife (Lake Bell) & the most amazing, talented children that played their daughters Breeze & Lucy. These child actors make this movie's rating even higher in my opinion. This American family gets caught up in a political war in an Asian country & they don't want Americans there to do specific work that will hurt their country. Meanwhile Jack & his family get caught up in it because he is sent to work there through his new company, thinking he is helping the country. This is action packed from the beginning! I feel the family was very authentic & I could feel the fear, sadness & in the beginning totally oblivious to what's going on & that is excellent acting. Eventually all goes crazy & they are trying to get to safety & to do this they must try to get their family out of the country & home safe, while getting around & through the ""bad guys"" In comes Hammond (Pierce Brosnan) who they met on the plane & he befriends them and helps them at the start of the movie, as he tells them he has been a ""tourist"" 15 times or so! Hammond becomes a key character & I just know he could have had more screen time with the character Kenny. Hammond was a key element player, to me in making this more real & I truly wish he had more camera time & just plain & simple a much larger part! Pierce Brosnan, who plays Hammond, is far to polished an actor to have such little screen time! He really could have done more along side of Owen Wilson.Just my opinion. I was upset at the truck scene as I thought it was one of the only things that didn't play out in a correct timely manner & was too forced, predictable, however very well acted & the stunts & pyrotechnics, etc.. were incredible... This movie had so much action that the crew of this movie should win awards too! Anyway, it took me on a ride & it was wonderful & scary & authentic & amazing all at the same time! The ending is exactly perfect & I feel it was the best homage ever! When you see it, you'll understand. I felt the choice in the end was perfection & I just wish I wrote this screenplay because I think it's brilliant! Brilliantly cast, brilliant crew, brilliant director & just everyone was brilliant! The ""so called bad guys"" were brilliant too! I believe this movie should be up for an Oscar Nomination for the movie, all the crew, the music & the leads! I truly believe the critics need a vacation from watching movies; they missed the mark on this one by a billion miles! I agree with those that commented about the new Mad Max being a chase in a car for at least 90-120 min. Only one I will ever see again is; that with Mel Gibson & it's because his Mad Max was perfection! I don't understand the critics being so harsh & so wrong about this movie! I cannot wait to buy it for my home collection! It's that good! Truly have fun! I don't want to spoil anything, it's that good! In hopes they will allow you to see this, I will stop typing. Just one more thing, this truly is the most well done action thriller in a long, long time! Every person & every detail was pretty much perfection & it only lost one point with me because they didn't use a brilliant actor(Pierce Brosnan) with a brilliant part as well as they should have! It's their loss, because it would have lifted it to a solid 10! This movie kept me glued to the screen & at the edge of my chair! I forgot everything around me existed, that was how great it was & it has to be pretty great because as a female, I'm more of ""where's the mushy"" stuff... Not with this movie.

357,theshininglevels,Not okay to repeat okay too much,1,5 June 2016,"Would some stalwart care to count how many times the word okay is used in this film? I lost count and I just don't have the stamina to start again! Did someone really write that word into the script so many times or did the actors just shove it in there as and when? Regarding the actual film, the story line is very good; however, the story was treated too casually. The family, that were central to this film, were too relaxed. They attempted to relay the fear and tension, but couldn't seem to muster up the passion to do so. It therefore lacked authenticity. So instead of portraying the story properly, they (writer, director, whoever,) relied on an abundance of gratuitous violence. Had it been directed and acted differently, the violence could have been diminished and the tenseness brought to the fore in a more realistic fashion. And had they limited, or banned the word okay, and used proper, well thought out sentences, it would have enhanced the story tremendously. In addition, there was a nauseating dose of soppy ""family"" dialogue, especially towards the end.",No Escape
358,jodyannesharp,Disappointing,5,30 July 2016,"I really wanted to like this movie, but it fell short of my expectations. This was clearly an Owen Wilson film and he did a great job. The rest of the cast was not as fortunate. We're supposed to care about this family but the constant bickering made it difficult to believe. In a life or death situation I would've found it more believable to see the family work together for survival. Instead, Lake Bell's character is second guessing everything, while the little girls hysterically complained. It made it really difficult to focus on the story. They also needed to weave Pierce Brosnan in better. Good try. I think this could've been a great film if they would've worked on the characters more, especially the kids. They were seriously ridiculous.",No Escape
359,tarranis,For John Erick Dowdle. Loved it but disappointed.,3,26 August 2016,"We were really enjoying this film but had to stop watching it. The variation in sound levels was quite unacceptable! We could not hear a word that was said in whispers and the loud passages were so loud that two of the group were covering their ears. Neighbors having a barbecue in the next garden were complaining. As professionals you guys should know that what works in the cinema does not work in the home. Adjust the sound levels guys!It looked like a really GREAT film. We were so disappointed! I've thrown the disc away.I'm taking the trouble to write to you about this not because I hated the film, but because I loved it. Or at least I loved what I have seen of it. The acting, even that of the little girls was superb. I was drawn at once into the story. At times it was almost too emotionally painful to watch. Perhaps they will put it on TV one day and I will be able to see the entire film. Here's hoping! It is such a shame that it should be spoiled by a trivial technical difficulty.",No Escape
360,iainrobertson-06857,Utter rubbish,1,13 May 2017,"Dire. One line plot, reality suspended throughout. This fictional Asian country apparently has no police or armed services, the US embassy is guarded by one soldier, no lock-down, no safe-room. Gratuitous violence throughout. No suspense, last time I watched this kind of movie Wile E Coyote was the villain. I have experienced three coups, seen the scary stuff, seen people shot and looked down the barrel of an AK. This movie is garbage.",No Escape
361,nahamasurfer,If you're tired of the super hero movies...,10,11 June 2017,"Finally a movie that is more analog that digital! I enjoyed this movie thoroughly because it did not have unnecessary explosions, unbelievable feats, a plot so interwoven that it was hard to follow. It was there right in front of you and immediately involved the other set of 'nerves' that you would not normally find in a movie. It was not Super hero or Friday the 13th 'Shock and awe', it was real. I personally want to see more of these movies that does not involve computer graphics.",No Escape
362,akguni-1,What a load of....,3,31 October 2015,"It was so promising... Owen Wilson AND Pierce Brosnan...It turned out to be another mindless action film, which could have easily been a Zombie movie or indeed a computer game.Completely unrealistic scenes, one dimensional ""story"", and the usual exploitation of family in a scary foreign land...There was even a laughable attempt at explaining the mindless violence. Ha! Who falls for this? Obviously quite a few people because of the relatively high rating. I bet it will be below 6 very soon and downwards - as it deserves.Here is 2 hours of my life I will never get back. It shows that IMDb score alone is not a reliable indicator. I should have cross checked.",No Escape
363,alksis-72786,Neuron genocide,2,7 July 2017,"How such a movie can get this high of a score.Could not stand more than 15 minutes of it.The introduction to this movie (and certainly what's coming after) can be perfectly pictured with this quote from one of the the main protagonist: ""Welcome to Asia"".",No Escape
364,ilsted,Worst filming ever,2,19 January 2019,Hopeless filming and clipping. You are bound to get motionsick. Studio scenes are too obvious and does not blend into the location sceneary. A pitty since I Owen Wilson does a good job acting and the story is exiting and catching.,No Escape
365,fukgglplaylogin,Surprisingly Good - Disturbingly Real,9,26 December 2017,"Nothing like adding a review 2 years after the fact. This movie is getting some air time on the movie channels and I decided to give it a shot. Owen Wilson in an action flick? Yeah, that's what I thought. I was about to change the channel, then I saw Pierce Brosnan on the plane, so I surmised he would be handling the action scenes. Who better to win against the odds, and do it with a bit of panache than James Bond? Brosnan's role was surprisingly limited, however, and Owen Wilson played his part of ""Joe Everyman"" with conviction and sensitivity. I forgot about Owen Wilson and began rooting for Jack Dwyer. I was utterly impressed.This movie has some parallels to the movie ""The Impossible"" about a family on holiday in Thailand when the 2004 tsunami hits. A family, in a foreign land, has their lives turned upside-down by a real, yet unimaginable catastrophe and must do anything and everything they can to survive. That's where the similarities end.In No Escape, the family - being foreigners - are literally hunted by the native population, who have overthrown their government precisely for collaborating with foreign powers at the expense of their country's future. It is the entirely innocent and unsuspecting foreigners (like the protagonists) of whom the revolution wants to make and example. And not in a nice ""this won't hurt a bit"" way, but maybe, like, by being beaten to death with a club, or dragged behind a car, or driven over by a tank while the victims are bound and kneeling. I should note that although violent, it is not gratuitously so. In fact, the actual violence that occurs under such circumstances, for anyone who is a student of history, is far more gruesome, and the camera cuts away from the worst of it. I appreciated the film relaying enough of the real violence in the world without drenching me in it. I had a definite appreciation for the life I am allowed to live after watching this movie. There is much that we take for granted.In fact, what makes this movie particularly compelling (I've never written a review here before) is the realism. Virtually anyone can imagine a ""developing nation"" such as Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, etc. descending into violence and chaos. In fact, there are several places around the world where this is happening right now, or may be about to happen. So we hear about these things in the news all of the time. And in our minds, it is an abstraction: that place over there, with those people whom I've never seen. But in this movie, they put you right in the middle of it in a way that is completely believable and credible. Who is to say that the next time we take our next exotic vacation that it won't be the exact moment when the country experiences a coup d'etat? And what would you do if you found yourself in that unimaginable circumstance? Although our protagonists are meant to survive to remind us of one family's will, the movie makes clear that they are the exception. As is much more plausible, virtually everyone else will die. And that is a realistic world view. Who was left on the ground when the Majors and Generals knew enough to pull out of Saigon? Of those people who were literally left behind, well, you can fill in the rest of the picture yourself.That is what this movie is about. But what makes it compelling and deeply affecting is actually love. Wow, I sound like a Hallmark cliche! But that is the truth, however much of a cliche. It is the love of this nuclear family unit that adds a compelling depth, an unexpected layer of humanity that elevates this movie above your average action/thriller fare: 1. First of all, anyone with any empathy, any sense of compassion whatsoever can immediately put themselves in the roles of these four scared, desperate, determined people. 
2. Secondly, it occurs completely within the realm of that which is believable - yes, it could happen, it could even happen to me. 
3. Thirdly, what torment must take hold of a parent's mind when they see men, women and children being murdered all around them? What demon enters one's mind when they imagine their lover, their spouse being beaten and killed - or worse...?These are the elements that ratchet-up the drama to seemingly untenable heights, yet the writers and director maintain this fevered pitch from beginning to end. And within that context, we are asked, ""What level of desperation causes a parent to fling their child off of a roof - either to the top of another building - or to their certain death? Could you do it? Would your throw be enough? If you failed, would you have the strength to go on, for the sake of the others?"" These are pretty intense questions that get asked again and again within the confines of extraordinary circumstances, and it never gets any easier. I think of all of the action-packed movies I've seen over the years: the fist ten minutes of Raiders of the Lost Ark are forever etched on my mind. The relentless pace of Training Day practically had me reaching for the aspirin by the time it was over. But this, this movie stands apart. Yes, it is action packed and you will be exhausted by the conclusion, and deservedly so. But part of that exhaustion is the emotional toll. The realism and the dilemma of trying - not to keep yourself alive, as is the usual perspective - to keep people other than yourself alive, and what that asks of you, that is the emotional toll of this movie, and it is well earned. The writers, Drew Dowdle and John Erick Dowdle, did an exceptional job elevating this from an action film to an action drama. They make the emotional anguish palpable; you cry for their torment. You don't necessarily have time to consider this while you're watching the movie, but the impact it leaves is significant. There are a couple of nit-picky flaws, some scenes that are predictable, some things that are simply inexplicable, and some things that are a symptom of Hollywood cheese. The flaws are easy to overlook when considering the whole, and I won't waste time obsessing about them anymore than a viewer should worry about them. This movie only got 4.5 stars out of 10 on Rotten Tomatoes? Last I checked, even G-d didn't create a perfect world. How many 8-10's do they have? Two? As I've said, I've never written a review on here, and the first one I'm writing is for a movie that is two years old. So that should give you an indication of the impression it left.Hope you get a chance to see it.

367,jimlewis-31032,Unexpectedly enjoyable,7,30 January 2018,Having not heard of this film before I watched it on Film4. I was pleasantly surprised. I found it gripping as the family are caught up in a violent revolution. Both the mother and father have to resort to extreme measures in order to protect their family. As they desperately try to seek safety they find themselves running from one perilous situation to another in order to avoid an anti western mob. All in all worth a watch. I even liked the ending.,No Escape
