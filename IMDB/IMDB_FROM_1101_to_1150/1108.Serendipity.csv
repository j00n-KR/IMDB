0,SnoopyStyle,Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack would make great rom-com if only they had more time together,6,27 September 2013,"Jonathan Trager (John Cusack) is looking for a Christmas gift for his girlfriend. Sara Thomas (Kate Beckinsale) is looking a gift for his boyfriend. They both pick a pair of gloves. They hit it off right away, but she refuses to give him her name. After a great night, she tries to give her name but a gust of wind blows it away. Then to give fate another chance, he writes his name on a $5 bill which she uses to buy certs. And she pledges to put her name in a book which she will sell. If either returns to them, then they'll know it's fate.Years later, he's going to marry Halley Buchanan (Bridget Moynahan). She's to marry musician Lars Hammond (John Corbett). But neither can shake that night and both try one last time to find the other. He enlists his best friend Dean Kansky (Jeremy Piven) and she enlists her best friend Eve (Molly Shannon) to help find their soulmates.Eugene Levy does a great comedic turn in a minor role. The two leads are a likable pair. The problem is that they aren't together much. They are a great pair at the beginning, but usually rom-coms require the couple to be together. They don't actually get back together until the very end. As it stands, it's a childish notion of love. The other problem is the pre-existing relationships. They really need to be shown as dysfunctional relationships right from the start. That way the audience is allowed to root against them without reservations.",Serendipity
1,claudio_carvalho,A Beautiful Love Story With a Very Charming Couple,7,10 November 2003,"Jonathan Tragger (John Cusack) meets Sara Thomas (the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale) by chance in the Christmas eve, in Bloomingdale's, both trying to buy the unique pair of black gloves available for sale. They decide to go to the cafeteria Serendipity and Jonathan asks for her name and phone. Sara decides to write it in a book, and his on a five dollars bill. She gives the bill to a newspaperman and she says that she would sell the book in a New York used books store. She states that if destiny wants them two together, Jonathan will get that book back. Or she will receive that bill again. From this day on, Jonathan will 'chase' Sara's book trying to reach his lost love.I did not know the word 'serendipity'. In accordance with Webster' dictionary, it means 'an apparent aptitude for making accidental fortunate discoveries'. The character of Sara believes on it, but regrets for her belief in the end of the story. This is the typical predictable and commercial film, but supported by a very charming actress (Kate Beckinsale) and actor (John Cusack). I am a suspicious viewer to make any comment in this regard, since I love Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack. But I really believe there is no way that any viewer dislikes this movie. The cover of the DVD is also very beautiful. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Escrito ans Estrelas"" (""Written in the Stars"")",Serendipity
2,jboothmillard,Serendipity,5,13 December 2009,"This romantic comedy was rated three out of five by the critics, so I knew this wasn't going to be cheesy and not very exciting stuff, but I do like some good cheese, from director Peter Chelsom (Funny Bones). Basically Jonathan Trager (John Cusack) and Sara Thomas (Kate Beckinsale) meet in New York City, in a shop called Serendipity, both looking for a pair of gloves. It is obvious there was love in the air that night in Christmas time, despite both having lovers, so they decide to test their fate by splitting up and seeing if destiny would bring them back together. So they took a glove each, Sara wrote her name and contact number in a specific book, and Jonathan wrote his name and contact number on a dollar bill. Years later, both of them are engaged to be married, but neither can not forget each other, and begin a little journey to find each other again. Jonathan tries to get his friend Dean Kansky (Scary Movie 3's Jeremy Piven) to find her, and Sara takes her friend Eve (The Grinch's Molly Shannon) to New York to search. There are a number of near-misses confusion along the way, but eventually they happen to chance on each other's ways of contact, and find each other at the ice rink for their fate and happy ending at Christmas. Also starring John Corbett as Lars Hammond, Bridget Moynahan as Halley Buchanan, Eugene Levy as Bloomingdale's Salesman and Lucy Gordon as Caroline Mitchell. Obviously the plot is very long shot material, but it has to be, and even though it a bit mushy, Cusack and Beckinsale just about keep it going, so it is reasonably entertaining. John Cusack was number 48 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Worth watching!",Serendipity
3,Quinoa1984,"The cast is likeable, but the movie itself is awful",6,5 October 2001,"Serendipity tells of two souls (John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale) who meet by fate in a Bloomingdales, spend a odd yet nice night together, then leave it all to chance as they write their phone numbers on a $5 bill and a used book respectively (or is it so respective?).  Then, years later, the two are close to getting married to different people, and yet want to try and find each other again.  Cusack and Beckinsale are good actors by themselves, and a appearance by Eugene Levy is always appreciated, but the script is so turgidly horrible in it's ways to keep the audience in suspended disbelief that these 2 people can't just find each other and get the movie over with (if the movie made any sense it should've ended in 45 minutes).  Maybe die hard (REAL DIE HARD) fans of the actors might find some use here, but others should beware like it's anthrax (and I don't mean the metal group). D+",Serendipity
4,michaelRokeefe,Trust in fate...it will take you where it wants to.,4,29 September 2002,"Not exactly a new story line, but this romantic comedy makes the concept work. A young man(John Cusack) and a drop dead gorgeous woman(Kate Beckinsale)keep meeting by chance and wonder if they are meant for each other. Although both are promised to others...oddly enough they still feel that their soul mate is out there somewhere. A little sappy in some places, but viva la love. Being a romantic I am almost obligated to be riveted. My favorite scene is where Cusack is on the ground and snow starts falling. The finale is almost too sweet, but most deserving. This is not one of Cusack's deeper roles, but who in the hell could not be smitten by Beckinsale. Notable support is provided by Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon. John Corbett plays the worst role I've ever seen him in. On the other hand Eugene Levy is quirky and funny. Watch this with your soul mate.",Serendipity
5,sunwarrior13,It's Not Hard To Enjoy Serendipity,9,8 September 2012,"Serendipity is a romantic comedy that tackles love-at-first-sight that revolves around fate, destiny, and chance.It features John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale. It was written by Marc Klein and directed by Peter Chelsom.Jonathan and Sara are two New Yorkers already in relationships when they meet one another, each reaching for the last pair of cashmere gloves at a department store. Over coffee, they strike up an intimate conversation, and Jonathan thinks they should see each other again. Unconvinced, Sara arranges an elaborate series of ""fate"" games; if they're meant to be together, she reasons, she and Jonathan will receive some sort of sign in the future. Flash forward several years, and the two are at opposite ends of the country -- Jonathan in New York and Sara in San Francisco, both engaged to be married. Still, neither can shake the memory of their chance encounter, and they both enlist their best friends to help them find their true love again. Although the movie is both formulaic and contrived,one cannot find it not hard to enjoy this one.Both Cusack and Beckinsale give fine performance and charismatic portrayals despite of not being on screen together for most part of the film.But nevertheless,the story maybe considered lightweight but it is not difficult to find delight while watching this film.",Serendipity
6,studioAT,"Different, but not great",2,16 October 2019,"This is a different sort of romantic comedy, and that's commendable, but that doesn't make it a good one.Everyone involved tries hard, but it's hard to ignore the fact that the two lead characters aren't that likeable, despite everything Cusack and Beckinsale are doing to try to make the material work.Enjoyable enough, but not great.",Serendipity

8,hitchcockthelegend,Fate or merely contrived circumstance?,7,12 December 2008,"Jonathan Trager (John Cusack) and Sara Thomas (Kate Beckinsale) meet while shopping in New York, after engaging in general pleasantries, they proceed to spend the rest of the day together and have a wonderful time. Sara is a big believer in serendipity, and coupled with the fact that both Jon and herself already have partners, she sends Jon mad by insisting that if they are meant to be together then the hands of fate will make it work. She signs her name and phone number in the front of a book and he signs his details on a dollar bill, if it's meant to be then these items will find their way back into each others lives again...Perhaps Serendipity just finds me in a forgiving mood each time I watch it? Perhaps I'm a hopeless romantic guy at heart and it works on an emotional level? Maybe I just love me a Christmas movie? But whatever it is? I just know that I really enjoy the picture. From its fabulous use of the New York locations to the amiable bankability of its two main stars, I know I'm being led to an inevitable warmth that delivers the broadest of grins on to my face. That's it really, it's not much of a review for you, but if you want to have the cockles of your heart warmed by a film that clearly delivers what it sets out to do, then Serendipity is just the ticket.Fire on, bottle of wine and the company of Kate and John. Lovely. 7/10",Serendipity
9,jotix100,"""We'll always have Bloomingdale's""",5,13 September 2004,"""Serendipity"" was a film I missed when it was originally released. Since there was nothing else playing the other night, I decided to take a look at it. The movie is pure sugar, so, diabetics, watch out!Spoilers herein.The screen play is a combination of styles we've seen before. Marc Klein has an ear for the way New Yorkers talk, but he seems to have been influenced by other movies of this genre that have been done better and with more flair. Peter Chelsom's direction doesn't add anything to the story either.The idea that this pair that fates conjures to bring together at Bloomingdale's at the height of the Christmas shopping season, is a pleasant one, but just to think that these two newly discovered 'soul mates' will make it against all probabilities just by sharing some wicked looking desserts at Serendipity 3, is preposterous. I'm not saying it can't happen, but it's extremely rare to have a Sara so coy and so silly to think she wouldn't give Jonathan her phone number right away. It's not every day one finds a hunk like him to let the opportunity go by, acting the way she does. I mean, she should have called a limo and taken him home immediately, why wait?John Cusack has done better work than in this film. Kate Beckingsale is an actress that is not easy to classify, but in this film she is not shown at her best. This is not an unpleasant film to watch if one doesn't expect too much from it.",Serendipity
10,Hey_Sweden,Sweet-natured romantic comedy.,7,16 August 2019,"John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale are a winning couple in this endearing fable about the nature of fate when it comes to romance. How much in life is random? And just how much in life is all part of some grand design? Can two people be destined to be together? Jonathan (Cusack) and Sara (Beckinsale) meet in Bloomingdale's while Christmas shopping and spend a few wonderful hours together. But she decides that they should let fate determine if they should ever see each other again.Years later, they're both engaged to other people, but they can't let their memories of that night dissipate; aided by their best friends, they embark on quests to find each other again.""Serendipity"" is a rather sweet yarn, concocted by screenwriter Marc Klein and directed with style and sensitivity by Peter Chelsom. Chelsom brings out the best in his appealing lead duo. Although Cusack and Beckinsale spent limited time with each other on set, much like their characters, they generate some real chemistry.Many of the characters are endearing; there are absolutely no villains here. The two fiancees in the movie, Lars (John Corbett) and Halley (Bridget Moynahan), are portrayed in an even-handed way, and you know that nobody in this scenario really deserves to have their heart broken. But Jonathan and Sara don't feel the same degree of ""magic"" with these two as when they so memorably got together.Wonderful support is provided by Molly Shannon as Eve, Sara's gal pal, and Jeremy Piven, as Jonathan's best man Dean. And as an additional treat, we get Eugene Levy in a very funny turn as a salesman who reluctantly gives Jonathan some assistance. The film does send us away with a smile when it brings back his character at the end.Definitely recommended to romantics everywhere.Seven out of 10.",Serendipity
11,preppy-3,Light...VERY light,6,31 October 2001,"Fluffy tale of Jonathan (John Cusack) and Sara (Kate Beckinsale) who meet cute in a department store, spend the day together and then part without revealing names. She puts her name and number in a book and he puts his on the back of a 5 dollar bill. Sara says if fate wants us to meet, we'll find those. As you can see reality stops right here. Years later they're both set to marry other people...but still pine after each other. Then they set out to find each other. Guess what happens?Utterly predictable with a seriously stupid plot line that works somewhat well. It's got a nice romantic feel, good music and very good acting. Cusack and Beckinsale are both attractive and utterly believable as the couple and there is very strong support from Jermey Piven as Jon's best friend and Molly Shannon as Sara's best friend. Also Eugene Levy throws in a hilarious performance as an anal store clerk.Still, I'm only giving this a 6--and that's mostly for the acting. The movie is not that funny and, even at 88 minutes, it feels padded. Also you know EXACTLY where this movie is going to end up so there's no suspense. Basically we got a 1 hour TV movie padded out to a 90 minute theatrical feature. Way too light but somewhat enjoyable.",Serendipity
12,The_Void,Nice little comedy that could have been better,7,31 December 2004,"This sweet romance is predictable and hinges on a rather unlikely scenario. I mean, if you'd just met someone that may well be your soul mate; would you really let them go and leave it up to fate to bring you back together? No, me neither; but Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack decide to do just that and that's the springboard for this romantic comedy. However, to it's credit; it does work and, for a change, here we have a romantic comedy with a definite point. Obviously it deals with fate; but there are also elements of finding the right person and not being able to be happy with someone you know isn't that person. It's true that the film could have been a lot better, as on the whole it's rather poorly handled and spends too much time being sweet or trying to be funny, and not enough is spent on building up the characters so that we'll care for them enough for it to be effective; but still, the film is a lot of fun and it's a damn sight more interesting than the vast majority of films in it's class.John Cusack is an actor that I rate. I don't think he's made anything poignantly brilliant at this time, but for many of his films; he's the best thing in it. That is a comment towards the quality of many of his films, but also towards his talent as an actor, as I feel he has the ability to hold an audience's attention and deliver a fine performance while doing so. The beautiful Kate Beckinsale joins him. Kate isn't a brilliant actress, as she shows in this film, but she is absolutely beautiful and she and Cusack make a nice couple together on screen. However, due the plot; they don't get to spend a lot of the running time together, with only one brief, if nice, spurt. The film is dogged by the usual romantic comedy hindrances, such as unlikely situations and a soundtrack of pre-recorded songs when a score would have worked much better; but the film is a good time and seeing the two's lives intertwine while not actually meeting is a quirky, and somewhat genius.As I said, this could and by all accounts should have been better. Still, it is what it is and it is good escapism.",Serendipity
13,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Serendipity (2001),8,9 November 2005,"So a pair of black cashmere gloves on a Christmas shopping trip brought two attractive strangers together, and they proceed to spend the most incredible night together at a cafe and an ice skating ring. However, the girl is a New Age Spirituality freak, and makes it oh so damn difficult for the guy to get anything out of her, even her name! It just drives a man insane, and she proceeds to make it so challenging and leave everything to Fate - Jonathan Trager (John Cusack) had to write his name and contact number on a five dollar bill, which Sara (Kate Beckinsale) proceeded to use, and if the note comes back to her because of Fate, she'll give him a call. On the other hand, she wrote hers on a book, which she will sell to a second hand book store, for Jonathan to look for and browse at each time he passes by a store.However another serendipitous game in a hotel finally made them part ways, but parting is such sweet sorrow, and each of them take active steps in seeking out each other when Fate comes aknocking - Jonathan seeks out Sara's last name, while Sara takes a trip to New York, and both make round trips around the Big Apple, revisiting places they have been to together.Fans of American Pie will cheer at the small scene where Eugene Levy appears as a conniving anal Bloomdale's salesman. And I like the scene using the Godfather movies as an analogy which Jonathan uses to explain his crush for Sara. While the couples shared Cassiopeia, I'll never forget my own Orion moment.The surprising thing though, is that you might bat an eyelid during the introduction. Both couples have their respective other halves (engaged, going to get married), but proceed to flirt so closely and strongly with each other, and to seek each other out. OK, perhaps Sara's Zen-music boyfriend is a bit of a jerk (it always plays out that way yeah?) but this is a Hollywood romance after all, one that deals with a fortunate accident.I've always been a fan of John Cusack - he's one of those underrated character actors in nice quirky movies; High Fidelity's still one of my favourites, and the soundtrack in this film is pretty cool too. And Kate Beckinsale, OK I confess, is the real reason why I'm watching this movie. They share a certain chemistry which is so enjoyable you're rooting for them to get back together as soon as possible to experience the magic again.So if you're feeling in the mood for a bit of cruel Fate filled romance comedy, then Serendipity is for you. Cuddle up with a loved one and pop this DVD into the player. Serendipity moments? Anytime for me :-P Code 1 DVD Extras: The gem in the extras are the deleted scenes. As mentioned above, some might bat an eyelid at the flirtation scene in which their respective partners are quickly forgotten. The deleted scenes were worse, so probably that's why they didn't make the final cut. Most of the scenes featured were from the introduction, with a totally different conversation piece at the Serendipity cafe. You must watch them to know what was originally intended.",Serendipity
14,SimonJack,A very good lost and found love story,7,3 January 2019,"The idea for the plot in ""Serendipity"" is not unusual. But neither is it common or overly used. It's what I call a lost and found love story. A man and woman bump into each other or meet at some event, and they have chemistry. That's a brief and modern way of saying they have a strong attraction and sense of belonging to one another. It's way beyond sexual attraction and interest. But, they have other relationships, and circumstances separate them almost as abruptly as they met.Then they spend considerable time after this thinking about one another, not knowing how to find the other person, and even searching for the other person. In a movie of this type, the audience watches in anticipation of their finally getting together. That's the draw and hold of the film.John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale are the two strangers who meet, separate and then spend years wondering about the other person. The story jumps a decade for its resolve. Jonathan Trager (Cusack) and Sara Thomas (Beckinsale) have other relationships, careers and friendships. With the exception of Trager's journalist friend, Dean Kansky, these other entanglements aren't anything special. They are even more distractions than film filler while the main plot unravels.Kansky (played by Jeremy Piven) helps Trager trace and look for his mysterious woman friend. Some of the best comedy occurs as he becomes obsesses with finding Trager's ""Miss Right."" The complications in this story are ominous because the couple didn't exchange names or addresses in the short time they were together. There are some nice and interesting twists about fate and their meeting.While the extraneous story and screenplay aren't particularly good, the hunts by man and woman are very good. That's where the screenplay picks up. The scenes of just missing each other, each going to the other's home, and arriving and leaving at the same places just moments apart, are fantastic. The natural frustration one feels watching these near misses is part of what makes this a very good film. It's not great, but it is a very good love story and comedy.Here are a couple favorite lines from the film. For more funny or clever dialog, see the Quotes section under this IMDb Web age of the movie.Eve, ""You know who plays golf? Guys who are too fat to play tennis.""Dean Kansky, ""Do you remember the philosopher Epictetus? You remember what he said? He said, 'If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid.'""",Serendipity
15,namashi_1,Destiny....,5,25 November 2009,"Peter Chelsom made passable Cinema in 'Serendipity'.... the film talks about how Destiny does everything for a person.'Serendipity' has been written by Marc Klein, who gives a few laughs here and there, but overall gives us a strictly average watch. OK, we don't expect a lot from 'Serendipity', but without a doubt the film could've been better. The film's climax isn't as impact full as expected. The film could've had a lot more drama..... ahhh... nonetheless it's a decent one time watch.The soundtrack is outstanding, 'Moonlight Kiss' is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard.Kate Beckinsale delivers a lovely performances. She's brilliant in emotional scenes. John Cusack excels, note his expressions in the penultimate scene, when he gets a tear in eyes... it's leaves you awe-struck. Jeremy Piven is Incredible as Cusack's best buddy. Eugene Levy stands out in a brief role. Molly Shannon is first-rate, as usual. John Corbett is decent, though his music-videos are hilariously shot.

""Serendipity"" is a an obviously fabrication...but a wonderfully romantic fabrication. Chock full of little signs of kismet calling two lovers together again, the film is a thoughtfully crafted piece unabashedly tailored for dreamers.

17,MovieAddict2016,A sweet and likable romantic comedy.,6,23 November 2005,"A certain someone I know considers ""Serendipity"" her favorite movie, and although it's not one of my favorites it is far better than I ever expected, thanks mostly to its strong cast: John Cusack, Kate Beckinsale and a very funny small turn by Eugene Levy.Pretty much a story of fate and how Cusack's character goes crazy searching for a woman he met one night. It's all about fate and once in a lifetime happening twice.This is definitely a romantic comedy i.e. it's a chick flick, but it's one of the better ones out there and most men would probably be able to enjoy it (almost) as much.Overall I was surprised by how entertaining it was and it has a fair amount of very funny jokes. It's not John Cusack's best comedy (see: ""High Fidelity"") but it's one of his better attempts at playing a typical Nice Guy role in a romantic comedy - better than ""American Sweethearts"", anyway.",Serendipity
18,thesar-2,Sleepless in Serendipity,6,16 January 2012,"OK, I understand 'Serendipity' (6/10 Stars) is a fan favorite, and even star Kate Beckinsale has been quoted to say most men that approach her claim this is their favorite movie of theirsbut I failed to get past the old plot – even for 2001. No, nodon't get me wrong, I did like this, I just didn't find it ""GREAT"" and despite the same ole story, SEE: the superior 'Sleepless in Seattle,' I was kinda disturbed after the first act because I found these two characters/actors (including John Cusack) had such beautiful chemistry. And like fate, they're torn apart and we're to spend another 1+ hours of them trying to reconnect. Worse, they're both engaged to their own partners and not enough – make that VERY LITTLE – was shown to me that they didn't belong to their current fiancés. Thankfully, that hour I wish I could see that ""chemistry"" growing, we have some decent secondary characters, namely Jonathan's (Cusack) friend, Dean (Jeremy Piven.) My only real complaint, as this was a decent movie, was it's really hard to find wonderful chemistry between two leads and here they had it and then hid it in the form of ""fate."" Sad and yet, I recommend it, if not just for the first twenty beautiful minutes.",Serendipity
19,cherold,A romantic comedy should be at least one of those,2,14 October 2001,"John Cusack romantic comedies are almost always good, but occassionally he First off, this movie, except for Eugene Levy as a snotty Bloomingdale's clerk, isn't remotely funny.  Watching Jeremy Pivin give an incredibly long toast in which the people around the table kept laughing while the theatre audience did not gives fair warning for the tedium to come.  And while on paper some of the film's ideas seem clever, nothing hits the right note. And am I the only one put off by main characters who have decided to try and find their soul mates in a few days and if they fail just get married to people they don't really want?  Are we supposed to empathize with these creeps?Bad, bad, bad movie.  Ignore all these odd people saying it's good.  I suppose it's my own fault for being so impressed by Cusack's name that I ignored the fact that it stars Pivin and Molly Shannon, two people who have absolutely no right to have acting careers.",Serendipity
20,Lejink,Wasted New York minutes,3,12 March 2014,"Just another wishy-washy, highly improbable, ""true love conquers all"" fantasy rom-com, which really thinks it clever with all that serependitious ""fate"" leading up to a big soppy, happy ending.John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale play the literally star-crossed lovers, whose chance meeting over a pair of gloves in Bloomingdales just before Christmas apparently sees them click as only true lovers can despite both being engaged to other people. Through partial design and massively coincidental chance they separate but return years later to their favourite New York locations where wouldn't you know it, they finally catch up with each other and re-ignite their earlier spark.This idea has been done before in the likes of ""An Affair To Remember"" and naturally ""Sleepless in Seattle"" but I found it very insubstantial and uninvolving indeed. The two leads are attractive enough but get given some terrible airy-fairy dialogue to spout. I felt that with more grounded writing, plus a few laughs and a decent soundtrack wouldn't have hurt either, but really, besides showing off some nice New York locations, this is one film I'm sorry my path happened upon.",Serendipity

22,inkblot11,"Lovely choice for romcom fans everywhere, Cusack and Beckinsale are great",7,29 November 2007,"Jonathan (John Cusack) works as a news photographer for a major station in Manhattan. One day, near Christmas, he reaches for a pair of black gloves in a department store and finds someone else is intent on grabbing them, also. Sarah (Kate Beckinsale), a pretty psychology student, has chosen them for a gift but is willing to concede them to Jonathan, as there are no other pairs available. But, Jonathan insists that she buy them and they part company. But, a short while later, they meet again on the same spot, mainly because Jonathan has left his scarf behind and Sara is still shopping. Now, declares Jonathan, this is fate throwing them together and they should go get a cup of coffee together. They end up at an ice cream shop called Serendipity, a favorite of Sarah's and then they head over to the local ice rink. Jonathan wants Sarah's digits, despite the fact that both he and Sarah are involved with others. But, after writing down her telephone number, the wind wrestles the slip of paper out of Jon's hands. Sarah says she believes in fate, too, and that the timing must not be right. So, Jon goes his way and Sarah goes hers. Now, close to seven years later, Jon is about to marry beautiful Halley (Bridget Moynahan) and Sarah is just becoming engaged to Lars (John Corbett). Yet, Jonathan suddenly longs to find Sarah and see if what they felt for a few brief hours was real. How do you spell complications? This is a lovely film for those romantic dreamers of the world. Perhaps there is only one soulmate for each of us and, if we search long enough, he or she will be found. As the star-crossed lovers, Cusack and Beckinsale are terrific, touching and sincere. The rest of the cast, including the marvelous Jeremy Piven, the equally marvelous Eugene Levy, Moynahan, Corbett, Molly Shannon and others, is great, too. The script is imaginative and sweet while the costuming, scenery, and production values are extremely nice. If you have skipped over this one, do not let days or weeks go by before locating it at the video store. It is an excellent choice for those blustery evenings, where tea and a serendipitous movie can make the world's problems go away.",Serendipity
23,ironhorse_iv,"While, fate might decides who comes into your life, it's your love that decide who stays. Serendipity shows that. It's worth the love that it got.",7,16 May 2016,"Normally, I don't watch, too many of these so-called, 'Chick-Flick' romantic movies, because how predictable and bad, they all were, but this movie directed by Peter Chelsom is worth watching and keeping close to your heart. I found 'Serendipity' to be very entertaining. The film tells the story of two strangers, Jonathan Trager (John Cusack) and Sara Thomas (Kate Beckinsale), who meet in Bloomingdale's after grabbing the same pair of gloves as a Christmas gift for their respective partners. Both, become very smitten with each other, but before they could exchange numbers and names, they were separate by fate. Leaving them, with nothing, but a few clues, on how to find, the other. Both search for each other for years, until one day, they found a new clue that might lead to reaching each other. Without spoiling, the movie, too much, I have to say, Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack really do seem like they have the chemistry for each other to make this movie, works, even if they only share a small amount of screen-time, together. However, I still see, their separation, as their own damn faults. Who tempts fate like that!? While, it's true, that the idea of these two, falling madly with each other, over a few hours, one night, might seem a bit, far-fetched & the contrived coincidence that follows, a bit impractical, but who says, watching a movie for escapism is bad news. Much of this movie's charm and humor, comes from the fact, that both of these characters, barely miss connecting with each other. I just wonder, what would happen to them, after they spent a lot of time, with each other. Would they really connect with each other, or will they grow bore & indifferent to each other? Who Knows! The movie doesn't explore that. It would be nice for some realistic, but this romantic comedy movie isn't that type of a drama-full film. Instead, the movie focus on lovesickness being like an illness, that people can't get over. I get what this movie is going for, but maybe, it's wasn't the best thing, to use the book, 'Love in the Time of Cholera', as a way to show that. Don't get me wrong, author Gabriel García Márquez is a fine book, but comparing love to a strong case of deadly life-killing disease isn't the best metaphor. Another thing, according to this movie, it is perfectly fine to go searching for the love of your life whilst neglecting the woman you are about to marry. Talk about an extreme case of cold feet. While, the respective fiancés, Halley Buchanan (Bridget Moynahan) & Lars Hammond (John Corbett) are neither interesting enough to merit their screen time, I do feel somewhat awful enough & uncomfortable about seeing them, get dumped for somebody, the two leads, only met once, long time ago. Also, there is something a bit sinister in this film, when a guy is able to stalk a women, based on what she buys. Isn't that, kinda illegal and somewhat creepy? It sorta makes Bloomingdale, look bad, when an employee is willing to give information, about a customer like that. It doesn't help that, this film was made, during 9/11 attacks in New York. Just think, how much the Patriot Act is allowed people to get away with now. While, I didn't like that, I didn't have too much of a problem with, is the clichés one-dimensional supporting character that has nothing else to do, besides helping these characters get together. Surprising, both Jeremy Piven & Molly Shannon as Jonathan Trager's friend, Dean Kansky & Sara's friend, Eve weren't that bad. It's just odd, that they would be, 'gun-ho' for travelling all over the world, just to see Sara and Jonathan to hook up. Another problem with this film, is how unreliable, all of their problems is, for the common viewer. All of the lead characters are white, mostly happy, and in the middle or upper class. In many ways, this conflict is very first world with all the yuppies product placements. Despite that, this movie is well shot in New York City and San Francisco. The locations used here, really gives the film, an identity. The very end, in an empty skating rink, with softly falling snow was just beautiful. Another cool thing, about this film is the soundtrack. Lots of guilty pleasure songs, worth checking out. Overall: While, this movie will never have the fans, that 1993's 'Sleepless in Seattle' or 1989's 'When Harry Met Sally' had. It's still a movie, worth seeing, at least once.",Serendipity
24,leplatypus,For those who haven't faith (dvd),7,16 October 2005,"3 good reasons for me to love this film:1 – New York: I love this city. It may not be the most beautiful city in the world, but since I was a kid, it gives me good vibes: always the same, always different2 – Christmas: My favorite holiday. It has all the best decoration and there is a time when you can tell people, you'll love them. And the snow3 – the point of view: This movie is a love story. But it don't tell why they fall in love but rather shows how they feel in this state. And even if the fate is very present in the scenes, it is an accurate illustration of the mood for love. When you got strong feelings for someone and this one miss you, the world you live in seems to recall this one at each minute, in all location You pick whatever book, you'll find a reason tied to this one. You walk in whatever street, you'll remind of a moment tied to this one.Another strong point in the script is the characterization's of their respective ""lost"" mates. They had been there because this couple wasn't together before. They surely shared something with them at first but it was weak and not surely true love: as the real mate keeps coming back, those ancient stories disappear. Finally, there is no scene of break-up as if they never existed. Sure, reality isn't like that but movies are best in showing what a dreamy life could be Like the Lennon's song ""Imagine""My serendipity mate would be this stunning brunette in the summer train of 2012: white shirt, brown short. She was cute as she slept and amazing as she smiled to me. She was with a girl friend and took another destination when we arrived. May we met again in the future, in the station or everywhere else !",Serendipity

From the man that brought you Hannah Montana The Movie,this film stars Kate Beckinsale,John Cusack,Jeremy Riven to name a few and tells the tale of two people named Sara and Johnathan who meet at a department store after stumbling on a pair of black gloves as they were buying them for their significant other. Of course they fall in love and Sara is superstitious when it comes to faith and destiny. So she decides to come up with a plan to separate with John and let faith run its course. Of course like I said they are getting married to other people but the big question though is this. Can faith run its course and will Sara and John meet each other again in the next few years or less?Yes the film is predicable as we all know that they are going to find each other again by the end of the film and its got the same premise as Sleepless In Seattle which starred Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan but overall it wasn't a bad romantic comedy and I was glad to see it again.Its a nice Christmas Rom Com and if you are like me a fan of Romantic films than check it out.C+",Serendipity
26,robert-temple-1,Pure delight,10,13 December 2007,"This is the ideal romantic film, brilliantly directed by Peter Chelsom (why does he not make more films?) and perfectly cast with John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale. Jeremy Given gave a wonderful performance as Cusack's friend, which greatly helps the film work. And special mention must be made of a hilarious cameo role played by Eugene Levy as the salesman one most dreads meeting at Bloomingdales in New York. (His hysterical 'don't step behind the counter!' is what we have all encountered so often with neurotic sales people. Of course, one 'understands', while laughing uncontrollably at them.) This film is funny, warm, life-affirming, ironical, strange, disturbing, comforting, and licks your face like a puppy. Its theme is the invisible tapestry and connecting threads of fate which lie behind the events of the visible world, especially as they relate to True Love. In other words, 'serendipity', or fortunate chance. Cusack and Beckinsale find each other, are eternally meant for each other, lose each other, and - well, I don't want to spoil things, - but let us say, search for each other for years, with results to be discovered by the viewer. It is all so charming and just right that rather than find another romantic film, one might just as well watch this one again over and over, with a steadily increasing and delighted smile. Above all, it is Cusack who makes this, as he is the ideal romantic male lead for such charming and elfish fare. His slightly pixie-like looks are just quirky enough, not too much to make him look truly odd, but enough to mark him on the brow as 'an innocent at large' who can have these adventures and really mean them.",Serendipity
27,Turfseer,"Instantly forgettable, well-directed piece of fluff",3,30 August 2009,"Even if you didn't like Serendipity (and I count myself as one of the unbelievers), there is still much to admire about the film's director, Peter Chelsom. If you watch the movie with the director's narration on the DVD, you'll see how Chelsom has a talent for infusing a film with a distinctive VISUAL stamp. He was also prescient enough to realize that the initial three scenes in the movie didn't work and insisted that they be re-shot. Watch the initial opening scene on the deleted tracks on the DVD—the opening scene that ended up in the movie is a thousand times better than the initial offering. Chelsom realized that the energy wasn't there initially, probably because the lead actors, John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale, hadn't developed sufficient chemistry (the opening scene was shot on the first day they were together on the set). Chelsom also spruces up the film with the clever use of time-lapse photography as well as the judicious use all kinds of interesting music.Despite Serendipity's 'nice look', one wonders why Chelsom decided to make this film in the first place. He sees it as a 'fairy tale' about being 'alive'—but even fairy tales cannot be mean-spirited. And that is the crux of the problem with Serendipity. Despite the seemingly magical magnetism between Jonathan Trager and Sara Thomas, their obsession with each other comes off as self-indulgent. The film's scenarist, Marc Klein, reduces Jonathan and Sara's partners—Halley (Bridget Moynahan) and Lars (John Corbett) to fates they don't deserve—in effect they have become virtual buffoons. According to Chelsom, Lars was originally supposed to be a ""Kenny G"" character but they wanted to push the envelope by transforming him into a new-age parody—somebody like 'Yanni' but more exaggerated. The Halley character is even more problematic as she is reduced to being the 'perfect' girlfriend—until being exposed as having a not-so-likable trace of obsessive-compulsiveness as part of her personality.Some people may go for the idea of a relationship based on a serendipitous chance encounter. The idea of ""love at first sight"" might actually happen in some cases but most relationships develop over a long period of 'give and take'. I think such an idea is a more realistic way of going about a relationship than having two people instantly fall in love without really knowing anything about each other. But even for those who are enamored with the idea of this superficial but instant love as a result of a chance encounter, Serendipity suffers from a lack of interaction between the two principals. For most of the movie, Cusack and Becksinsale have little screen time together.Instead, most of Serendipity focuses on the comic relief of Cusak (accompanied by his sidekick best friend Dean Kansky played by Jeremy Piven) attempting to uncover Sara's identity through a credit card receipt found inside the cashmere glove that Sara gives to Jonathan as part of the strange pact they concoct when they first meet each other. The receipt takes Cusak to Bloomingdale's where he meets a neurotic salesman played by Eugene Levy. Levy's shtick goes so far; far funnier is the arrogant and pretentious French artist, Sebastian Mignon, whose 'portrait' of Sara turns out to be a Picasso knockoff which is utterly no help to Trager and his buddy, desperate to know what the long missing Sara looks like.While Trager and Kansky's quest to find where Sara lives is mildly interesting, Sara's decision to find Jonathan by flying from California to New York (accompanied by her buddy Eve played by Molly Shannon) doesn't pack any punch at all. Unlike Jonathan, who has a credit card receipt to work with, Sara's trip back to New York is based merely on her intuition. She has no idea where to find Jonathan but believes another serendipitous meeting will take place. As it turns out she's walking around the city without a clue, while the viewer is supposed to be entertained with all kinds of ridiculous moments of déjà vu (for example, when Sara finds the gum on the back of the bench which Trager had left earlier at the golf range). There are even more incredible coincidental moments such as when Halley turns out be Eve's old college friend. Director Chelsom was even going to have Sara and Eve get into the SAME cab as Jonathan and Dean are seen making their exit, but admits to nixing the idea on the grounds that the coincidental moment was just too beyond the pale.When Halley hands Jonathan the book, ""Love in the Time of Cholera', which contains Sara's phone number, it's a bit of a stretch but in keeping with the direction in which Serendipity has been taking us. But the coincidence of the $5 bill returning to Sara's hands was completely far-fetched given the number of $5 bills in circulation in New York City.Equally perplexing is the sudden disappearance of Sara and Jonathan's respective lovers at the film's denouement. Again, in order for Sara and Jonathan's romance to work, the other lovers must be completely dispensable. That includes all the real-life recriminations between the families we should have been privy to surrounding the calling off of the Jonathan-Halley nuptials.Once Jonathan and Sara are back in each other's arms at film's end, I wonder if this is a couple I really should have been rooting for all along. If the message here is 'true love conquers all', does it have to involve such selfishness? Perhaps it would have been better if Lars and Holly ended up together which might have softened the blow of the respective couples' split-ups.Despite excellent direction and cinematography, Serendipity is a fluff piece which is instantly forgettable. Proof for me is that I had initially forgotten that I had seen it back in October 2001 while watching it for a second time recently on DVD.",Serendipity
28,meeza,Fates to Blac at times!,7,30 September 2002,"Do you believe in serendipity? No! That is not the name of the new stripper working in your nearby strip club. That happens to be the name of the destiny-themed romantic comedy film starring John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale. Cusack and Beckinsale's characters meet one night in chilly New York and leave it up to destiny to meet again in the future. A little advice for Mr. Cusack's character- when you meet someone that looks like Kate Beckinsale, you dis destiny and get those digits, dude! Anyways, years pass by and of course both of their characters are engaged to half-wits. Yes! It is a `pity' that we have seen this formulaic development way too many times in romantic-comedies. The films  `serenade' theme does touch a few heartstrings, and it is also very intriguing if our main protagonists are going to get together and create a `destiny's child'. However, it is still not enough for me to `dip' into `serendipity' by categorizing it as one of the best romantic comedies of the year. *** Average",Serendipity
29,noralee,John Cusack & Jeremy Pivens Should Be In a Better Movie,4,6 December 2005,"""Serendipity"" is half-way between ""Sweet November"" and ""You've Got Mail."" The plot premise is about as silly as the former, while it has some of the acting charm and New York locales of the latter.John Cusack (as usual) makes the movie worthwhile as he gets so intensely involved in his romantic search. Ah, the poignancy on his face of the silent scene when he realizes that fate really has selected his impossible-to-find soul-mate. He and Jeremy Piven should clearly make a whole series of buddy movies as they exemplify what the Ozzies call ""mateship,"" such as Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau do, as in ""Made.""The distaff pair just isn't as interesting. Yeah, Kate Beckinsale is pretty, but that's it. Molly Shannon, as The Best Friend, is much toned down from SNL. While John's fiancée is a bland bore, at least Kate's fiancé is a satirical hoot, with John Corbett as a savagely satirized Yanni. But that New Age nonsense is confused throughout the story line about fate. I got lost in the lame discussions about signals vs. signs vs. no coincidences, etc. (which was much better discussed in ""Happy Accidents."") Of course my limitations in losing myself in the movie were hampered by the 3 young women in back of me who translated the entire movie (even when there was no dialog) into some Eastern European language. I guess ""Shush!"" didn't translate.Points off to the movie for filming mostly in Toronto with just some establishing shots in NYC, mostly in front of the Waldorf Astoria.The soundtrack had some interesting selections - David Gray, Nick Drake, Shawn Colvin-- but not songs that were either strong lyrically to the plot or strong on their own, and really weakened by the over-the-credits Evan and Jaron.(originally written 10/7/2001)",Serendipity

I have seen this film twice, truthfully it's one of my family's favorite films, but I can't stand it. John cusack is completely UNlikable here, I feel nothing in his performance, no heart and no feeling. And there is no romantic on screen chemistry between Beckinsale and Cusack, absolutely none. That is what a romantic comedy must get right, that is the chemistry. I will say this, Molly Shannon is good here, funny as hell. Truth be told that's why I gave it a 2, she was the only good part of this film. John Corbett is weak here, he fails as being funny or slightly entertaining. The writing is just standard, nothing special to brag about. Jeremy Piven also falls flat. This movie is BORING, it doesn't engage its audience at all, doesn't offer any real feeling or satisfaction either. I wish I could give you a good review of Serendipity and say it's a cute heart warming movie with good chemistry, but unfortunately, that's just what I wish it was, I put the majority of the blame on John Cusack, and the lack of chemistry. Serendipity receives only a 2/10, because of Molly Shannon's funny performance as Beckinsale's best friend.",Serendipity
32,dierregi,"Unrealistic ""romantic "" notions",1,12 August 2020,"Believing in the ""one"" is a popular myth that only recently started to lose steam. In real life - and Hollywood ""romantic"" comedies - it is a huge torture device, used relentlessly to make people feel miserable about their relationships.Cusack and Bekinsale meet cute and spend a few hours in pre-Christmas New York city, knowing instantly that they're each other's special one. Perversely, they create a series of stupid obstacles, to prove that fate will keep them together and then get separated.Fast forward five years and even if they're both on the brink of marriage with other partners, they embark in the search for each other because those few hours were so unforgettable - or they're just not ready to commit.Much has been written about people crazily in love with strangers, the stress on the ""crazily"". Not having had any chance to actually get to know the other, they can believe in perfection, projecting all their frustrated needs and expectations on a fantastic creature beyond their reach.Besides being disloyal to their partners, the Cusack/Beckinsale characters have zero chemistry and not even once their ""connection"" rings true.

33,rbverhoef,Funny and sweet,8,16 February 2005,"Although I realize 'Serendipity' is not a good film, I have to say I like it. Decisions and plot lines are not even a little plausible but there is a great chemistry between John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale that really makes up for that. So let's not talk about the story, which in a way is always predictable with romantic comedies. I mean, the two stars will end up together, right? Besides the chemistry there are funny moments too, most of them with John Cusack. I always like him and especially in films where he has to look sad and disappointed for quite some time he is terrific. He did it in 'High Fidelity' and 'America's Sweethearts' and now in 'Serendipity' again. It seems so natural you just have to feel sorry for the guy, who is occasionally quite the comedian as well. Beckinsale is mainly there for her beautiful British accent and the sweetness she brings to her weird character with her strange decisions. At least she is a lot better here than in 'Pearl Harbor', although I guess that was not really her fault. There is also a great cameo by Eugene Levy, Jim's Dad from the 'American Pie'-films. I am not sure whether he is really that funny, but by just seeing him I laughed.In the end 'Serendipity' is a romantic comedy that works because of the stars and everything they put into this film. Plausible stories are never really something we see in romantic comedies, although the very best do a pretty good job, 'When Harry Met Sally' and 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' to name some. Still, this is fun and sweet and we feel happy at the end. No reason to complain.",Serendipity

Of coarse, I might not love it as much if it didn't have such a great cast, including two charismatic and unforgettable romantic leads, played of coarse by Kate Beckinsell and John Cussack.Serendipty is one of those movie's that anyone who dislikes sappy, schmaltzy, romantic comedies will probably hate, but for those who like A smart romantic comedy, chock full of a bit of a fairy tale/fantasy edge, touched off by that (""Love Actually"", the holidays are almost here) kind of feeling, this is your movie.

The whole movie is dreamy, from it's look, to the engaging characters. It's not difficult to keep your eyes on the screen throughout.Serendipity's premise is a great idea for a movie and always stays engaging, never drifting off into silliness, even though many things happen that are unrealistic. It's great as a date movie, as one the whole family can enjoy, and to watch with a group of friends. My only minor criticism is the amount of time it takes these two to get together but the ending makes it worth it.Beckinsale and Cussack have a limited amount of time together on screen, with most of that time happening at the beginning of the film. But in that short amount of time they are able to display more believability and chemistry to the falling in love aspect then many on screen pairs who get triple the amount of screen time do.I give this between an 8.5 and 9 of 10.

35,eric262003,Sappy Romantic Comedy In All Its Formulaic Glory,6,26 December 2016,"Ever felt you locked yourself in a slushy romantic comedy and you have no alternative but to accept the fact that you brought the ticket and you have to endure all the mushiness whether you like it or not? So we have two very attractive individuals who are going their business going Holiday shopping and then by by default they start conversing with each other over a certain item and it takes till eternity.This truly is what the film ""Serendipity"" is all about. Just a standardized, done to death structured, man meets woman romantic comedy. I can imagine screenwriter Marc Klein scratching his head trying to add an original twist to the overblown genre, but can't and does all he can guarantee we can still enjoy the film no matter what the outcome is.The movie is directed by Peter Chelsom who has directed such great films like ""Funny Bones"", ""Here My Song"" and the career-high for him which was Warren Beatty's ""Town and Country"". The leading performers are John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale as two urban-dwellers who meet by default and fall in love. The only problem, they're both seeing other people.Sure it looks polished when written, even through the casting of Cusack who can always provide a competent performance in romantic comedies with his general likeness and warm personality of the roles he's played in his career. But still Cusack requires a compelling script and a proper haircut. He loses here on both accounts here. It has all the similarities to the 1993 classic ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and the overly sugary ""You've Got Mail"". The only difference we get here is awkward silliness over the more wittiness that aforementioned films provided. And it's nowhere close to the inventive intentions of the always enjoyable ""When Harry Met Sally"".Cusack plays the role of Jonathan a TV news director who's gone holiday shopping when he randomly meets a young lady named Sara (Kate Beckinsale) who we don't know what her profession is, but we do know she's obsessed with a thing called fate. They join each other for coffee at a place called ""Serendipity"", imagine that. This events leads them for a little skating at Lincoln Centre and get more closer to each other as the superficial snowflakes come falling down their hair. She eventually writes her number in the book ""Love in the Time of Cholera"" and he writes his number on a five dollar bill. Which means if they should cross each others numbers by coincidence in the future, it means they were meant to be together.And so for a ninety minute film it feel like an eternity when these two ever meet each other again. Even though the premise of this film of two strangers whose acquaintances rapidly involves to friendship which leads to love is very unheard of, what irks me the most is what about the people they're both seeing. How do they fit into the picture? To really ensure a likeness to John and Sara, they have to be in a relationship where their lovers aren't that likable, but not overly hated to the point where we question the tastes within John and Sara. By way of contrast their loves can't be too likable because we wouldn't have any reasons why we should care for John and Sara. From my observations, John seems to dating a likable, but not a very interesting woman. And Sara seems to be in a relationship with a musician of an Eastern band, tooting on his flute while romantic interludes are interrupted while shouting through his cellphone. He's foolish but hard to know how foolish he is exactly.These shenanigans go on until Jonathan and Sara finally become a couple as they casually kick their lovers to the curb. The scenes seem absurdly simplistic with no gasping spark, and the clichéd happy ending feels predicable and forced with no real obstacle for either of them.""Serendipity"" reminds me a lot like Ulu Grosbard's more superior and vastly underrated Brief Encounter remake starring Meryl Streep and Robert De Niro which has a similar theme about two people meeting by chance while Christmas shopping with the exception being that movie has a more real story behind it and a more mature approach that the stars must face.Sure the genre of this movie is a romantic comedy, but for this movie to work we need something believable to invest into the story. ""Serendipity"" doesn't have anything we can relate because everything is so innocent. It's like everything is handed so simple to the couple we never see any conflicts to make us fully care about the characters no matter how likable they are.",Serendipity
36,philip_vanderveken,A perfect mix of humor and romance,8,16 February 2005,"Don't ask me why, but I've always had a weak spot for romantic comedies, at least as long as they have some quality to offer. I don't like this kind of movies to be too sweet (a problem that you'll encounter too often in this genre). I only want a lot of sugar in my coffee, not in the movies that I watch. ""Serendipity"" isn't too sweet. It has the perfect mix of humor and romance, which keeps it all interesting from the beginning until the end.A man and a woman, who don't know each other, meet for the first time during their Christmas shopping, when they both want to buy the same pair of gloves. Because only one of them can have the gloves, they decide that the 'winner' will pay the other one a coffee in a coffee house nearby, which is called ""Serendipity"". They have a great time together, but at the end she refuses to give him her phone number. As a great believer in fate, she believes that if they are meant for each other, fate will bring them back together anyway. She writes down her number and name in a book that she'll sell the next day. He'll have to write his number on a 5-dollar note. If he finds the book or if she gets the banknote, they will see each other again, if not, this will be their only encounter. Many years go by and they have never seen each other again. Both are about to marry someone else, but have never forgotten that special day. Before they get married, they will try to find each other again...Overall the acting in the movie is more than OK and the story is nice. The pace is good and the movie never annoyed me. I'm well aware that this may not be the most original movie and of course you already know how it will end as soon as the movie starts. Almost all of these movies end in the same way. I guess you could even call the entire movie unrealistic and unbelievable, but somehow it never bothered me. Perhaps I just wanted to escape the daily reality for 90 minutes, perhaps I just wanted to believe that people who are meant to be together will always find each other... I don't know, but what I do know is that I liked the movie, no matter what some people think of it. I give it an 8/10.",Serendipity
37,Chase_Witherspoon,A match made in Bloomingdale's,8,3 October 2012,"A man (Cusack) is at the department store on Christmas eve to purchase his girlfriend a gift when he has a chance encounter with the alternative woman of his dreams (Beckinsale). Over the course of the evening the two come to realise that they may be each other's destiny, but when they decide to put it to the test, they become separated and Cusack spends the next few years looking for the one that got away.John Cusack is an at times frustrating, neurotic actor who seems to only play varying shades of the same character. Nothing more true of his performance herein, and yet, it works. I actually thought Kate Beckinsale wasn't as strong or committed in her performance, but the supportive cast including Piven as Cusack's tubby best friend and Brigitte Moynahan as his unfortunate fiancée add to the spark. Eugene Levy is amusing in a brief two-scene cameo as a store salesman.There's something undeniably feel-good about this movie, which offers no real surprises, but still manages to keep you guessing on the how and when aspects. Somewhat reminiscent of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", it's an easy-going light romantic comedy that's one of the best of its ilk.",Serendipity
38,tomsview,Delightful discovery,7,8 December 2015,"Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack, along with plenty of candles and Christmas lights give this movie a warm glow.In how-to-draw portrait books, we are taught to start with sketched lines to define a classic head shape, then to divide the face into equal segments – few people in real life actually fit those idealised proportions, however Kate Beckinsale does – and as Sara Thomas, she has never been photographed to better advantage.Along with her polished English accent, and her understated style, she is a disarming package (and also possessor of an outrageous sense of humour judging from late night chat shows). It actually makes believable that John Cusack's Jonathon Trager would keep her memory fresh after meeting her for only one night five years before.Cusack is interesting for other reasons. There always seems to be something else going on beneath that somewhat cynical surface. I'm not sure romantic comedy is as natural for him as it is for her. He seems more defined by edgier fare such as ""The Grifters"" or ""The Frozen Ground"". However, that may be just the right energy for this role because for much of the film Jonathan is engaged to another woman while desperately seeking Sara.The production is a stylish one, and exudes a romantic quality. If there is a disappointment it is that genuinely witty lines are a little hard to come by in ""Serendipity"".Normally a comedy can get a lot of mileage out of best man speeches, but the one delivered by Jeremy Pivan's character is a bit of a misfire. Other lines although milked hard, don't quite make it.Fortunately, the scene where Jonathan encounters the sales clerk played by Eugene Levy delivers laughs lacking in other places – sales clerks, whether acid tongued, prissy or totally obsequious, rarely fail to get laughs in comedies, especially when in the hands of expert practitioners such as W.C.

39,xredgarnetx,Probably the worst romantic comedy ever made,2,19 May 2007,"The only reason SERENDIPITY rises above the ""1"" rating is because it is a John Cusack movie, more or less, but certainly nothing Cusack would ever want showing up on his resume. If I were having a John Cusack festival in my video rental store, I would not want this to be one of the available titles. Cusack and Kate Beckinsale, an Elizabeth Hurley-lookalike the way Sandra Bullock used to be a cheap alternative to Julia Roberts, meet cute fighting over a pair of winter gloves in Bloomingdale's. Problem is, they both have significant others and both are headed for the altar given time. But they manage to spend a pleasant snowy evening in Manhattan, first over coffee at a deli called (what else?) SERENDIPITY and then ice skating in Central Park. They promise to meet up again if chance should allow it, he by writing his name and number on a $5 bill and she by writing her name and number in a book. Don't ask how this is supposed to actually work. Some years later, they continue to pine for each other as they prepare for their respective nuptuals. Cusack is about to marry a gal about 10 times sexier and prettier than Hurley -- oops, I meant Beckinsale! -- and she is engaged to the incredibly sexy John Corbett. Plus she now lives in California while Cusack still hangs in the Big Apple. The point is, it's not as if these two don't have some pretty significant others. Cusack spends most of the movie chasing around trying to find his lost love, with best buddy Jeremy Piven at his side. Both are wasted, although Cusack gives it his best. If Beckinsale continued to make such movies, she'd be forgotten today. She barely registers here. Molly Shannon is Beckinsale's best buddy, and even the normally flamboyant Shannon barely registers. Every single step in this movie is as predictable as the fake snow that seems to fall at all the right moments in this hackneyed romantic drivel. And while you have to believe Cusack and Beckinsale will find each other in the end, it is sadly predictable that it will not be allowed to occur until the closing moments. Cusack and Beckinsale perform together for maybe 10 minutes of the movie. Eugene Levy has what used to be called a walk on, and you just know he must have been a last-minute addition thanks to his success as the kooky father in the American PIE series. He manages to grab a stray laugh or two playing a rather larcenous department store clerk. If you value your sanity, you will skip this one. Every cliché having to do with last-minute altar thoughts is employed. If it worked this way in real life, no one would be married.",Serendipity

41,jhclues,Cusack and Beckinsale Make It Work,9,8 October 2001,"Magic happens, if you let it; and sometimes even fate or destiny-- or whatever you want to call it-- steps in to lend a hand.  But when it concerns love, and finding that special person you're going to spend the rest of your life with, should you risk tempting fate with a test of that love or what is seemingly meant to be, or should you just follow your apparent destiny and embrace it?  Such are the questions two people must face and answer in the romantic comedy/drama `Serendipity,' directed by Peter Chelsom.  Jonathan Trager (John Cusack) is shopping for a gift for his girlfriend, and Sara Thomas (Kate Beckinsale) is looking for something for her boyfriend when they reach for the same pair of gloves on a rack at Bloomingdales.  And the wheels of fate are quickly turning.  Or are they? Jonathan and Sara proceed to spend the next few hours together, including a romantic interlude skating in New York's Central Park, and there are definite sparks flying between them.  For Jonathan, it's a significant emotional experience, and he realizes something has happened, that something has changed in his life; Sara feels the same, but being a true believer in destiny, she needs a sign that this is meant to be before she'll consider pursuing whatever it is that's just happened between them.  So she puts it to the test.  And for Jonathan, knowing only that her name is Sara, it's the beginning of an odyssey-- a quest-- to find true love with the woman he already knows in his heart of hearts that he wants to share his life with. For Sara, it's the beginning of a search for love, and for that one special person she knows is destined to be her soul mate forever.  They both find, however, that the path to pure love is filled with every obstacle the known universe could possibly place in their way.  And is the journey worth it? Well, in the end, it all comes down to what fate has predetermined.  Or does it?	In the tradition of such films as `Sleepless In Seattle' and `You've Got Mail,' Chelsom has fashioned a truly romantic tale of two people who are absolutely destined to be together, no matter what.  And-- as the audience knows early on-- nothing less will be acceptable.  Hanks and Ryan may be missing, but the charismatic Cusack and the beguiling Beckinsale more than make up for it, carving out their own niche in the genre with this outing, and Chelsom has just enough of that Nora Ephron touch (including the use of music, matching the perfect song with every situation) to make it work.  The chances of things ever happening in real life the way they do in this movie are about twice as remote as winning the lottery, but who cares?  This is a heartwarming fable about love-- about the way we `want' love to be-- and it's delivered with an endearing care that makes it emotionally involving, entertaining and a thoroughly satisfying experience.  And there's not a whole lot more you can ask of a movie, I think.	Cusack is so likable, and manages to convey the bedevilment of his situation with such facility, that the viewer is unequivocally drawn in from the beginning.  You want things to work out for this guy-- and Sara, as well; and, of course, you're pretty confident from the outset they are going to.  But along the way they make you feel something; they enable you to share the frustration as well as the elation that comes with discovering love, and perhaps finding that better part of yourself at the same time. And the fact that Cusack makes Jonathan so believable, and someone with whom you can identify, has more than a lot to do with it.  It's a quality performance from an actor with the flexibility and range to do just about anything, and who never disappoints.	The other half of the equation for success, of course, belongs to Beckinsale, who is not only beautiful, but a good actor who infuses her character with a touch of mystery and complexity that makes her winsome and interesting.  Like Cusack's Jonathan, Sara is someone you can root for; you want to see her get what she wants and what she deserves.  This isn't a perfect world we live in, and we all know it; but for Sara and Jonathan you want it to be.  There's a chemistry between the two of them, and they make it so easy for you to project your own feelings and desires into their situation, that there's no getting around it.  If they win, you win.  It's that simple.  And even though they take you over some rough spots along the way, it's a fun trip and Beckinsale and Cusack-- Sara and Jonathan-- make it a journey worth taking.	The supporting cast includes Molly Shannon, Jeremy Piven, Bridget Moynahan and Eugene Levy (who is terrific-- and hilarious-- as a sales clerk at Bloomingdales).  A handsome film that touches all the right nerves and pushes all the right buttons, `Serendipity' has a gentle sensibility about it that addresses the notions of romance and love that reside within us all. And it's refreshingly presented in a way that is pure and inoffensive; and as such it allows you to open up and embrace something of value without having to apologize for it, and without implying you have to be `hip' to appreciate it.  Because it's all about love and sharing love, which is something we can all use a little more of in this world we live in today. And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.",Serendipity
42,jon.h.ochiai,Life of Passion,10,7 October 2001,"""Serendipity"" is a magical romantic comedy. It is a great movie. Director Peter Chelsom crafts a modern fable about a world given by design where two people are each others' soul mate. In this case it is Jonathan (John Cusack) and Sara (Kate Beckensale) who contest over a pair of gloves while Christmas shopping for each other's sweetheart seven years ago in New York's Bloomingdales. Jon and Sara have the magical and wonderful evening of their lives. According to Sara it is serendipity which she defines as a ""fortunate accident"". She suggests that if they are indeed soul mates, they will meet again-- it's fate. So Jon agrees to write his phone number on a five dollar bill that she spends at a newsstand. Sara writes her name and number in a copy of ""Love in the Time of Cholera"" which she will sell to a used bookstore. The very romantic setting in the hands of writer Marc Klein, takes some unexpected and funny turns. Klein keeps what could have been very predictable so very charming and satisfying. We catch up with Jon and Sara present day. Jon is a successful ESPN producer engaged to be married to a lovely woman, Halley (played by Bridget Moynahan). Sara is a counselor in the Bay Area also engaged to Lars (John Corbett), a New Age musical star-- really. Halley is great, though she is not Sara. So Jon enlists the aid of his Best Man, Dean (Jeremy Piven) to find Sara three days before he is to marry. Sara also begins her quest to find Jon with her cynical pal, Eve (Molly Shannon). Cusack and Beckensale have amazing chemistry that sustains the separation of the storyline. John Cusack is funny, vulnerable, and so very human. When he and Piven force Eugene Levy's Bloomingdales clerk to track down Sara, they could have been considered stalkers, instead it is comical desperation. This is a tribute to a talented cast. Kate Beckensale's talents are on display here. She is believable as the woman who gives into serendipity-- she has faith. This creates an inspired quest-- finding their soul mate. What distinguishes the movie is when Dean, a New York Times Obituary Writer, acknowledges Jonathan when he tells him that the ancient Greeks did not write obituaries, but asked rather ""Did he live with passion?"" Sure, searching for your soul mate is ridiculous or maybe considered being a ""jackass."" Though at the cost of living a life with passion, like the characters, Jonathan and Sara, we can say ""So what."" ""Serendipity"" offers a wonderful journey for living a life with passion.",Serendipity

Therefore, I was surprised that I actually enjoyed the film beyond his performance.Serendipity is essentially a fairy-tale about two people (Cusack and Beckinsdale) who meet in a department store, and have a couple of breathy, wonderful hours together.  They are both attached at the time, and decide to let fate step in if they are truly meant to be.  Cut forward a couple of years and Cusack is about to be married, yet something is drawing him to seek out this woman who made such an impact on him.  The premise is standard romantic schlock, but the script is blessedly peppered with some intellect and clever lines.  Piven and Cusack once again make a great team.  I got absolutely nothing out of Beckinsdale's performance, it could have been played by anyone.  Cusack basically saves this film from being a completely ridiculous romance - his character is basically a grown up extension of his character in ""Say Anything"".  But then again, Cusack is one of those rare modern actors who could be in a movie featuring him watching paint dry and I would watch it, so I could be biased. --Shelly",Serendipity
45,Pedro_H,Empty shell of a script made worse by second string acting talent.,4,18 March 2004,"An English girl and a native New Yorker meet in a wintry NY and have a wonderful time and yet part  without knowing each others name or exchanging contact information. They decide that if it is ""meant to be"" they will find each others telephone number from a book insert and a dollar bill that they pass in to general circulation.The central premise rather reminds me of that WC Fields gag about a guy who threw himself out of a plane, taking a chance that below him was the world's largest haystack! With a device as silly as this you better hope that the acting and the script have something better to offer. Sadly they don't!John Cusack is a master at these lone romantic movies - reading through his credits he seems to play the oddball, the misfit or the self-pitying eccentric more often than most.  Maybe if he stood upright properly, put his shoulders back and spoke in a clear and confident voice he would get a wider choice of roles. The guy has a good head of dark hair, a slim build, a pleasant face  and is well  over six feet tall - he doesn't need to keep playing the man that has self-doubt over whether to use the bathroom or not.Kate Beckinsale is quite nice and well spoken, but doesn't have anything to suggest she is a star. There is no humorous undercurrent to her and the dialogue just falls out of her mouth like she is reading a dinner menu out-loud. She is supposed to be running around (literally) finding a man that she has ""let slip away"", but her eyes are dead a dodos - I don't believe it. Mind you even Sandra Bullock couldn't make this work and she is the queen of offbeat romance!You can just see the pitch with this film: A light romance with a twist. But the twist keeps the people in love apart so we don't really have much of a romance. It is more a pointless chase movie and even the most naive  watcher knows full well how it is going to end. If this is a film aimed at women then women should take offence that they are expected to  swallow this warmed over trash.",Serendipity
46,bopdog,"Heartless, tedious, and offensive, this movie tries to pass cruel disregard and obsessive anhedonia off as ""romance.""",3,14 April 2002,"Some very good actors got together to make a mediocre movie. Aspects of this supposed ""romantic comedy"" are downright creepy! For example, the hero, John Cusak's character, is some kind of whiny, creepy, obsessive jerk who pines after some rather bland English girl for YEARS after meeting her for one sexless night in New York. OK--- that might fly, given the whole ""soul mate"" destiny motif of the movie. But then he becomes engaged to a sweet, attractive woman who obviously loves him very much, and even the night before his wedding to this innocent and utterly charming lady he STILL chooses to chase after this rather frigteningly stubborn memory he has of the English girl. Why does this movie think that dumping and hurting such a nice person is somehow ""overlookable,"" or OK in the ridiculous and insulting pursuit of plot?And then there is is frustration comedy element. Endless sequences of near-misses and other cosmically crossed-wires are irritating. The main characters are also joyless, apparently suffering from some form of advanced anhedonia, or at least profound ingratitude. We are supposed to think this is poignant? Romantic? Funny? I really can't guess what on earth was going through the writer and director's minds when they concocted this hurtful mess.In real life, if you ever encounter anyone as ""stalky"" and obsessed as the character John Cusak plays here, call the police at once!

48,FlickJunkie-2,Enchanting romantic comedy,9,7 May 2002,"This charming romantic comedy has all the right ingredients and serves up a bouillabaisse of schmaltzy romance and slapstick fun.  Jonathan (John Cusack) and Sara (Kate Beckinsale) meet in Bloomingdales when they both want to purchase the same pair of gloves.  The attraction is instant and they spend a romantic evening cavorting around New York City together.  At the end of the evening John wants to see her again, but Sara decides that if it is fate that they should be together, they will find each other again.  She drives away in a cab and he never sees her again.   Well, almost never.Years go by and both of them are about to be married, but each still has this nagging feeling that the other was his/her one true love.  Of course fate conspires to bring them back together (after about a dozen near misses) as they each simultaneously undertake one last attempt to find one another just before they get married to someone else.The fate angle is plowed mercilessly, almost to the point of nausea, but the skits are funny and the chemistry between Cusack and Beckinsale is enchanting.  Cusack is an expert at playing the tortured and neurotic lover, but here he is more haunted and forlorn than dysfunctional, and it plays much better than his previous two characters in `High Fidelity' and `America's Sweethearts'.  Kate Beckinsale rocketed from obscurity to prominence with her performance in `Pearl Harbor' and proves to be a wonderful romantic lead in this film. She is breezy and adorable and spins a delightful web around Jonathan and the viewer.  The film also benefits from outstanding comedic support from Jeremy Piven as Jonathan's best friend and devoted Sara sleuth.  Piven's zany comedy proves to be the perfect complement to Cusack's wry despondency. Eugene Levy is a scream as the eccentric Bloomingdales salesman, who blackmails Jonathan into buying half the store to give him information from Sara's charge account.All in all, this is an entertaining comedy that is insubstantial but delectable.  I tend to give romantic comedies a little more slack, because I'm a sucker for this slush, and this is one of the better ones I've seen in a while so I rated it a 9/10.  This lighthearted romp makes a great date flick, but if serious drama is your preference stay away.",Serendipity

That got me reflecting about life, and helped me endure the rest of the movie.John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale didn't have a huge amount of chemistry or on-screen time together. I think the movie actually benefited from that. Some could argue they were constantly cheating emotionally on their respective partners throughout. Far too often I also had to suspend all disbelief - such was the whimsical, ""only-in-the-movies"" nature of many scenes.The New York locations held my interest though, as did the romantic at heart in me. Eugene Levy and Jeremy Piven probably had the best roles in the whole film. The kind of film to make you browse the Missed Connections section of the classifieds.

When they have to part, Jonathan wants to take things further by getting Sara's phone number and getting in contact with her again, but Sara isn't sure if this the right thing to do, as she believes in fate and thinks that if they're really meant for each-other, then they will be. A deal was made, Jonathan would write his phone number on a dollar bill and Sara would write her phone number in a book and sell it to a used book store. If they're both meant to be together, then Jonathan would find the book and Sara would find the dollar bill. This is where they leave each-other and go there separate ways. Many years later though, after still not seeing each-other, both are engaged to be married.

There's just something about him, I guess.  And let's not forget Kate Beckinsale!  WOW!!!  That is one good looking woman!I'm not going to lie to you, this movie is definitely a ""chick-flick"", but that doesn't mean it's not good.  The movie is really simple, and nothing complex, but the characters are cool and the cast is great.  There are a number of little things I liked about this film.  One in particular is that they made Jonathan's (John Cusack's) fiancee likeable.  Usually, in films like this they make the main guy's fiancee or girlfriend, very unlikeable, so that they can easily dispose of her when the time is right and hook up the two people that the audience hopes will get together.  Anyhow, I liked that they made her likeable, it made it a little harder for the audience to just think ""forget her, go to Sara (Kate Beckinsale)!!!""  I hope that makes sense.Eugene Levy's character in the film was VERY odd, there were a number of things that he said and did that just struck me as REALLY out of place and really odd.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, but I just thought his character was a very strange one to put in the film.Ever since I saw ""Judgment Night"" I thought Jeremy Piven was a cool actor, and he does another great job in this film.  His character is so funny, and a very cool person.  He's the kind of guy that you want to hang out with.

I think he's got the chops to pull off a lot of different roles and there's this dry wit about him that I love. And Kate Beckinsale is, let's be honest here, she's absolutely gorgeous and finally she's able to show the world that she's not just another pretty face but can actually act. So we're faced with a couple that meet by accident, have a perfect date and are going their separate ways. But they're going to let fate decide if they're to be an item or not. So if within 10 years they meet again they will wind up together. If not, it was never meant to be.Years pass and while they've moved on, each of them in a relationship and thinking of getting married they can't let go of that one chance meeting while buying gloves for their respective loves.

Cusack can act but just can't do light comedy. Example: the critical hotel elevator scene in the beginning with the obnoxious kid & chubby (wouldn't be funny if dad wasn't chubby, right?). It should have been hilarious. Picture Cary Grant who was the master of these kinds of comic situations (see Bringing up Baby, for example) or Tom Hanks who cut his teeth in comedy.

58,the amorphousmachine,Will they ever meet again? Who Cares?,5,27 February 2005,"The only Peter Chelsom film I've seen prior to 'Serendipity' is the much better and vastly underrated 'The Mighty' (1998), and I really have to see his other works to really get an idea of him as a director. Though 'Town and Country' (2001) was a critical disaster.Personally, I'll see anything with John Cusack in it. He is not necessarily a great actor in terms of range, but his appeal in terms of likability always draws me to his films. Even a seemingly sappy romance like this one in 'Serendipity'! Kate Beckinsale has never really done much for me, until recently when I saw her in Scorsese's 'The Aviator' (2004). Until that film, I didn't really think much of her as an actress, and 'Serendipity' was one of the earlier films that didn't sell me on her. Basically, this romantic-comedy is the usual predictable stuff that Hollywood churns out.It's all about ""what ifs?"" and destiny! Sudden chance meets, and finding that true love. Instead of not knowing who the other person is; ala a theme explored in 'You've Got Mail' (1998) and 'Sleepless in Seattle' (1993), where Hanks isn't aware of Ryan being the other mystery internet woman in one film, or Hanks has to search for that elusive voice of Ryan's in another film! Here in 'Serendipity'- Cusack meets Beckinsdale, thinks she's the one, but she's not so sure, so she writes her number on the back of her book, and if destiny works for them, then they'll be together. Very sentimental indeed! Understandably, Cusack is none too happy about this, but regardless 10 years (or something like that) goes by, and each of them are living separate lives in different countries too.So, both parties realise that they are curious about the other, and even still think about the other. Kate realises that she could have made a mistake not taking a chance in Cusack all those years ago, and Cusack starts to find signs that symbolise that night with her all those years ago! The rest of the movie spends them indecisively discussing with pals about what to do and what does everything mean, and has the whole ""they just missed each other"" gimmick, as they both go look for each other! And of course, destiny plays a part too! Feels like old ground covered before in films of this ilk. 'Serendipity' is watch-able, but it never really takes off for me! It just felt so rehashed, and cliché, and that I've seen this before somewhere!

60,Catharina_Sweden,"Charming, but predictable and dishonest",6,7 January 2012,"This is a romantic comedy following the standard formula. It is very predictable: after the first ten minutes already, one knows exactly how it is going to end. Still, it is a beautiful movie to watch in Christmas time, with all the Christmas decorations in the famous New York department stores, and the equally famous winter skating rink in Central Park.However, I cannot enjoy romantic movies and novels as much now as I did when I was young. Because their promise of the Mr Right whom Destiny is going to take us to when the time is ripe, is a comfort at the moment. It gives you hope and something to daydream about. But in the long run I think many people - especially women of course - will only become disappointed with real life, if they watch too many of these movies. They market a dishonest message that can destroy people's lives, if they go on believing the sweet promises instead of taking charge of their lives themselves.",Serendipity

64,kyle-cruse,"A better ""Sleepless in Seattle""",8,1 June 2009,"""Serendipity"" is similar to ""Sleepless in Seattle"" in the ways that the main couple really does not interact throughout the film and the fact that a majority of the movie involves the two of them trying to find each other. However, this film manages to succeed for me in a few ways that Sleepless did not. First of all, the one thing Sleepless lacks is having the main characters meet at some point earlier in the film, which gives us no real reason to want them to be together at the end. Here, the main characters meet at the beginning and not again until the end, so this time we feel like they had a reason to be in love. This film has some real motivation for John Cusack and Kate Beckinsdale to find each other, since they knew what each other was like, rather than one hearing the other over the radio. This film also doesn't make us endure the annoying, bratty kid from Sleepless and leaves us to focus on the main characters. ""Serendipity"" is still not an overly great film, but manages to be enjoyable and allows us to care enough about these characters to appreciate the ending. The near misses between the two of them in this film is what makes it enjoyable and romantic. Not perfect, but will make a good date film, and it is one of the better structured romantic comedies I've seen lately.*** out of ****",Serendipity
65,atzimo,A Meg Ryan movie (without Meg Ryan in it!),10,12 June 2002,"I paid for this movie, only because of the trailer. Specifically for the 'old spice' joke, which was hilarious.Unfortunately 'Serendipity' isn't as cool, or as original as the trailer shows. It is a movie made for girls, since the story is the ultimate girl fantasy: to meet the man of their lives and send him away, so that destiny will bring him back, forever!John Cusack plays this fairly regular guy, who meets a girl played by Kate Beckinsdale. The girl is crazy, totally insane. I mean, there is no way this psychotic person be a psychiatrist! She believes in all the usual girly stuff: stars, destiny, feeling that she is the center of the universe, etc. So when Jon loses her phone number, she believes that this is a sign and because of her eccentricity they have to undergo a number of love games that should prove if they are really meant for each other.Now one small note: would anyone ever let this paranoid girl get away with all the crazy stuff she does? Imagine living a life with her. Even when her poor fiance gives her an engagement ring that doesn't fit well, she takes it as a sign from destiny! A bit too much I believe.The bad thing about the movie is that it is not crazy enough, to make all these incidents seem more believable. Instead of being a Farreli movie, it becomes this Meg Ryan type of movie, that will drive most men insane, while it will make all girls daydream. John Cusack never played in 'cute' movies, all of his movies included funny 'immature' moments that gave them enough comedic edge. 'Serendipity' on the other hand is too nice, made to please girls (no stupid 'guy' humor here).To sum up, I feel that 'Serendipity' would look much better if it had Hugh Grant instead of John Cusack. The director and the female protagonist are British, so why not make 'em all British? Plus, Hugh seams a lot more patient than John and this girl really needs someone with a lot of patience. I am a John Cusack fan and I feel sorry that he was wasted here.SPOILER: What ever happened to their fiances? All these years lost, only because of a crazy girl!5/10",Serendipity
66,Jakemcclake,Fate - Karma - Serendipity Call It Whatever You Either Like The Idea or Hate The Idea,7,1 October 2009,"Some Spoilers I read most of the negative reviews, and I agree with some that the two main characters jilt their fiancées in an unkind, unjustified way. I also agree with comments about the predictability and unrealistic nature of the movie to a degree. However, when I watch romantic comedies, I do not look for surprise endings or documentaries.The majority of the negatives reviewers condemn the Sarah Thomas character for testing or tempting fate. I kinda agree that she should not have done this. The negative reviewers also focus on what reviewers consider the unrealistic concept of fate taking charge in this movie.My own critique would be that the climax of this movie was not as good as other romantic comedy climaxes. Considering all of that, I found this movie had an uplifting message, that fate, will control what takes place, and that Fate/Karma will work things out in the end. I like that concept. Many do not. I believe in a higher all seeing all knowing power that causes justice to prevail in the long run. The uplifiting message of the movie combined with great music and the unrelenting, tension-packed, two-front chase throughout the movie made this movie worth it to watch.",Serendipity
67,Starbuck-13,This is John Cusack!!!,9,6 December 2001,"I really think that John Cusack is one of Hollywoods most underestimated actors. In this new movie of his, he once again is absolutely convincing in the role of a totally normal guy who goes through an emotional roller coaster ride as he meets the girl of his dreams, looses her, forgets her and then finally decides that he has to do everything he can to find her again.The movie is, of course, romantic and funny, but what is most joyful about it is that it comes without the embarrassing kitsch elements many producers seem to be so fond of today. The movie is a wonderful little gem which has the right speed and the right actors. The only thing that might be hurting is that it is certainly painful to watch for every single guy and girl out there who feels cheated by fate. But well, I was lucky enough to watch it with my girl-friend so I can only guess. And the movie certainly is a perfect ""Watch-with-your-girl-friend-movie""!!!",Serendipity
68,dtb,SERENDIPITY Charms Despite Tempting Fate and Trying Patience With Overuse of Whimsy,8,8 February 2004,"The plot premise, in a particularly streamlined nutshell:  In holiday-season Manhattan, Sara Thomas (Kate Beckinsale) and Jonathan Trager (John Cusack) meet cute and, although they both have Significant Others, they end up spending a charming and romantic evening on the town (including coffee and dessert at the aptly-named Serendipity III restaurant).  Despite their obvious chemistry, Sara insists on leaving their future up to fate (she turns out to be a therapist, so you'd think she'd know better, but more on that momentarily), whereupon they get separated in the Waldorf=Astoria. Years later, Sara and Jon are both engaged to other people, but can't stop thinking about one another, so they each take a last stab at finding each other again before their respective nuptials.  Knowing what a big John Cusack fan I am, a friend of mine recommended I rent SERENDIPITY. Between a parade of people phoning us and our own busy schedules, however, I had almost as much trouble getting to finally sit down and watch the DVD from start to finish as Jon and Sara did trying to get back together in the film itself!  But it was worth the effort:  even though I was growling at Sara under my breath for being so stupid as to leave their budding romance up to fate instead of running off with Jon when she had the chance (and was Sara so new to NYC that it never occurred to her that other people might take Jon's elevator in the Waldorf=Astoria during their decisive elevator race? Do fate and common sense have to be mutually exclusive?), I found Cusack and Beckinsale so endearing and so full of romantic chemistry (and they both looked yummy, I might add) that I found myself forgiving a lot and rooting for them to get back together.  Marc Klein's script is so chock-full of funny and frustrating near-misses that at times I found SERENDIPITY as suspenseful as a Hitchcock film! :-)  NYC and San Francisco locations are used wonderfully (I was pleased to see that although the second floor of Serendipity III as shown in the film was quiet enough for Sara and Jon to hear each other talk, it was still as crowded as it usually is on a holiday week! :-).  Cusack and Beckinsale are surrounded by a delightful supporting cast, too, particularly Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon as their respective best friends and the scene-stealing Eugene Levy as an officious, self-serving Bloomingdale's salesman.  I also found it refreshing that the filmmakers didn't take the obvious route of making the leads' current Significant Others so horrible that you can't imagine what attracted Our Heroes to these creeps in the first place (that sort of thing always makes me lose respect for both the protagonist *and* the screenwriter).  Bridget Moynihan and John Corbett (did the casting directors just stroll on over to the set of SEX AND THE CITY one day and say ""Who's free to make a movie?"" :-) were appealing enough that I could understand what Cusack and Beckinsale saw in them, yet they were just self-absorbed enough and not-quite-on-our-heroes'-wavelength enough that I didn't feel bad when they got dumped. If romantic whimsy is your bag, give SERENDIPITY a try.",Serendipity
69,neenahhh,Serendipity (n): fortunate accident,7,6 April 2011,"If I were to be asked right now to make a choice between my future career versus my future so-called soulmate, I would choose my career, no questions. I'm just really a strong believer that love isn't everything. I don't think it's right for people to drop down all that they have just to give love a chance. Call me a skeptic, but that's just my belief. Nevertheless, I cannot deny that I really did enjoy this movie.Jon (John Cusak) and Sara (Kate Beckinsale) were two strangers who met one morning in a crowded department store by accident. They share a short cup of coffee and a nice conversation afterward. We learn that Sara is a strong believer that fate controls everyone's life. She implies that she met Jon because of fate. After their meeting, they part ways, not giving their contact number to each other directly, and leave everything up to fate. The movie takes place a few years later after their initial meeting and we see both of them trying to find the other desperately.John Cusak and Kate Beckinsale were perfect for the leads. Jon was lovable, determined and oh-so-romantic. Sara's trust on fate and destiny went a bit overboard, but it worked! I loved this movie. It had everything a romantic-comedy movie needs. An excellent story, subtle humor and two leading actors who made a great connection. This movie is now another one of my favorite rom-coms. Don't miss this.Viewed on: April 7, 2011",Serendipity

72,ed_two_o_nine,Finally a rom-com for adults,7,3 January 2008,"When Jonathon randomly bumps into Sarah in a department store whilst both trying to purchase the same pair of gloves an instant bond is formed. Sarah has a great believe in fate and takes Jonathon for some food at her favourite café 'Serendipity' and explains to Jonathon her faith in fate and how if they are meant to be together then fate will make it so. A chain of events is then set in place which leads to a highly obvious conclusion that makes for a very enjoyable ride. Not being a great fan of romantic comedies I always come to films of this genre with trepidation but found this to be the exception to the rule, a high quality rom-com which is actually an geared for adults and not the normal teen stuff. This is a well directed film which is kept together tightly with little to no wasted scenes, bring the film in at a respectable 90 minute running time which I feel is just about right for romantic comedies. The leads do very good jobs of their roles and remain enchanted by each other considering how little of the running time they actually spend in each other's company. Now it helps if like me you are a big fan of John Cusack, but he really does very well with this role bringing a real feel of reality to the role making a man who could seem shallow or even dastardly at times seem real and earthy. Kate Beckindale does the English rose thing well without being the over the top prim and proper English girl character that we quite often get presented with in American movies. They are well supported by the always magnificent Jeremy Piven (the man is such a subtle scene stealer!). I would highly recommend this movie to fans of romantic comedies and to movie fans in general. I will be watching it again with my wife.",Serendipity
73,Captain Ed,"Well, not TOO bad, but ...",6,15 October 2001,"I suppose I came out of the theater thinking that this movie was better than I thought it would be, and I admit that it's a pleasant bit of fluff. However, if you are looking for more than that, or if you just make the mistake of looking too hard, you'll be disappointed.John Cusack -- who is definitely getting too old for these types of roles and looks it -- bumps into Kate Beckinsale at Bloomingdales.  (Can we say 'corporate sponsorship', children?  I thought you could!)  They spend a magical evening together until Beckinsale starts spewing New-Age nonsense about how to test Fate and so sets up the central conceit of the film.  I wonder if the screenwriters are also still single and looking all over New York for an obscure used book.Now, Beckinsale is simply heart-melting in this role, and Cusack is always good on screen, even if he's in a role he should have passed on.  The rest of the cast is equally capable; I was especially surprised by Molly Shannon, who manages to act as though she was raised among humans for the first time in her movie career.  I liked Jeremy Piven in a role similar to the one he had in 'Family Man'.  (How many remember the first film he and Cusack did together as featured performers -- 'One Crazy Summer'?)  The cinematography was very well done and the music fit the mood, although if I see ONE more NY-romantic-comedy with a Louis Armstrong song, I'll scream. 
**SPOILER AHEAD**So, my problems with Serendipity boiled down to the screenplay.  Does every romantic comedy have to have two people dumping their fiancées -- one almost literally at the altar -- in order to achieve happiness?  I guess I wonder why I should give a damn about two people so self-involved that their previous commitments mean little or nothing to them, except in Cusack's case, where it is used just as a philsophical measuring stick (bird in the hand vs two in the bush).   And although Beckinsale's boyfriend is a goof, I actually liked Cusack's bride-to-be.  It seems needlessly mean-spirited, and even though we like Cusack's character, he really begins to look a lot more like a case of arrested development than a romantic protagonist.  Even his character in 'One Crazy Summer' seemed more mature than this.  Would a woman REALLY want a guy this allergic to keeping his commitments, always chasing after his whims?Anyway, that's probably more analysis than this films demands (or deserves). Like I said, it's a pleasant bit of fluff, so if your expectations are properly set, 'Serendipity' will entertain you.  Just don't spend a lot of time thinking about it later.",Serendipity

I thought the story was really sweet, the idea that fate will lead you to do the craziest things in order to find true love. I do believe in those type of things, that something inside of you has to be induced in order for you to take a chance.

Considering the fact that this wasn't a typical rom-com (the lead couple barely had 15 minutes of run-time together), their romance sealed the deal right at the very beginning with the meet-cute. Kudos to the writers for structuring the plot so unconventionally!The best part about the movie is the characterization. The lead couple played their roles so wonderfully that I couldn't help but root for them to end up together. The 'almost' moments and the near-misses that were in the story were so frustrating and I was at the edge of my seat hoping for a happy ending.

78,Phantasm01,"""Destiny""",8,13 August 2006,"Do you believe in fate? How about destiny or the fact that everything happens for a reason, and there are no coincidences in life? In the romantic comedy Serendipity, it is a story of two New Yorkers, Jonathan Trager (John Cusack) and Sara Thomas (Kate Beckinsale) who meet by fate in a Bloomingdale's department store over a pair of black cashmere gloves, and spend an odd yet nice night together, then leave it all to chance as they write their phone numbers on a five dollar bill and a used book. If the bill or book is found then they know that they were meant to be and that fate has brought them together. Years later, after neither have found each others phone numbers, the two are close to getting married to different people, basically on the same date. While both are having second thoughts about their current situation and can't get the other off their minds, try one more time to find each other. This hopeful romantic film is a great date movie and highly recommended. If you don't believe in fate now, you will once you have watched this movie.Serendipity means a fortunate accident. I personally think that everything happens for a reason and that there are no accidents or coincidences in life. So this movie was right up my ally. A little frustrating at first though to see a couple hit it off so well and then leave everything to chance, but if it was meant to be then it will happen, right? The two go through some pretty suspenseful twists and your left thinking if they're going to end up finding each other. The lengths that they both endure are so sweet you just want them to find each other and fall madly in love again.John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale have amazing on- screen chemistry, and when put together they make the perfect pair. John Cusack is a very witty guy in this film and is always there for a good laugh. His character, Jonathan Trager is your typical hopeless romantic that you end up rooting for in the end to find the girl and sweep her off her feet. He is a very talented actor and is nothing short of in this flick. His character is also paired with best friend Dean Kansky (Jeremy Piven), an obituary writer for the New York Times. Together these two are the dynamic duo. Jeremy Piven with his one-liners and comedic timing is a perfect side kick for the uneasy and confused Jonathan Trager. Both are in the race to find the girl of Jonathan's dream, running all around New York, pulled in a million directions, and fighting over obstacles in order to have one last chance with ""the one"" that got away, two days before his wedding. Opposite John Cusack, Kate Beckinsale is also an amazing actress to watch. She sparkles on screen with her beauty and grace, playing the perfect girl for Jonathan to chase. She too is linked with a best friend, Eve (Molly Shannon) who is by her side the whole time tearing through New York to try and find Jonathan. Molly Shannon's character owns a new-age store in San Francisco, and has just the quirky style and comedic support to balance out Kate Beckinsale. They are the perfect best bud match and are fun to watch interact with each other. With the wonderful setting of the beautiful New York and these four talented actors this movie was sure to attract all those hopeless romantics out there.Serendipity overall is a fantastic movie, with an interesting storyline, talented and well known actors all to a backdrop of the beautiful New York skyline. This is a great romantic comedy that will keep you in a pleasant suspense until the very end, and left wondering if there is a certain person out there that you are meant to spend the rest of your life with. Will you meet by fate, by chance; is it your long time best friend, or the person sitting next to you on the subway? This movie leaves you questioning your every move, and second guessing your life choices. Give fate and destiny a chance; you never know what they will bring to you.",Serendipity

For example, the best friend of the main actor, played by Jeremy Piven, gets a really funny monologue when he appears in the movie for the first time.John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale really didn't made a good loverpair. Not only that the woman looked far better than the man, she also acted far more natural, and the two doesn't develop some kind of magic like, for example, Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler in 'Wedding Singer'.

83,RolloTomasi,Don't call it a chick flick,9,9 October 2001,"This is certainly the best romantic comedy of recent years. I can only speculate why they moved this from an August release to October. This is the kind of crowd-pleaser that should be given the full backing of summer season advertising, marketing, and audience availability.  ""Serendipity"" is your typical boy-loses-girl story where you know from the beginning how it's going to end (but anything but typical because it's actually romantic and actually funny). As with any romance, it's the journey that matters. It's what Jon and Sara discover about themselves while they're looking for each other.   ""Serendipity"" reunites John Cusack with Jeremy Piven, who again plays the best friend role. Pound for pound, the Grosse Pointe Blank scenes are better, but there aren't as many. Piven's Dean has a lot more screen time here. Some of the funniest scenes feature these two, sleuthing their way through New York City (and SF briefly) searching for a girl Jonathan can't forget. The story is very nicely scripted. There's never a dull moment, really. Act II, which typically is the middle, longest portion of the story, is the parallel stories of Jon and Sara longing for each other while not completely into their respective future spouses. For both of them it's as if they're both trapped in the wrong life. Then comes the search, with Jon using a more clinical approach (sales receipts, addresses, phone #'s) and Sara using gut instinct. The whole time you're thinking 'it's not going to work because they're trying too hard' and you're right. They keep missing each other, sometimes only by inches. Writer Marc Klein convinces the audience that they are meant to be together, even as he convinces Jon and Sara that maybe it wasn't meant to be after all.I wasn't surprised to see ""The Mighty,"" one of 1998's best films, among director Peter Chelsom's credits. One minor folly on ""Serendipity"" was casting Molly Shannon, who I'll never be able to take seriously, as Sara's best friend. Her character mirrors Piven's but the role is noticeably smaller. Much of it was likely cut. Chelsom's direction coupled with John de Borman's understated cinematography make this film like a valentine to New Yorkers. Big Apple, be proud. Odd that two films set in NYC (the other being ""Don't Say a Word"") ended up opening the same weekend, with that locale being crucial to the story.

It's unfortunate that such a brilliant comic pairing couldn't have been made on Beckinsale's side. Her ""best friend"" is quite dim and provides nothing for the film except flimsy plot points.It's a standard romantic comedy. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because...I don't know. Perhaps because there were too many opportunities for ratcheting up the intensity or interest that went by the wayside. Perhaps because I wanted to sleep during several scenes.

Despite a slight age discrepancy (Kate Beckinsale is a tad young to be a perfect fit with her two suitors), the pairing of the British Beckinsale with the all-American Cusack is screen-history magic.  The film's screenplay is literary and worth concentrating on and the visuals and soundtrack/score are first-rate!  It evokes some comparisons with the mega-blockbusters of a few years ago (My Best Friend's Wedding and Four Weddings and a Funeral), and manages to ""hit in the big leagues"" with both ""fun films"" of the past.  What I liked about the script's daring was the clear parallel with the super-brainy and cutting-edge wit of the triangle (Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewart, Katherine Hepburn) in the classic PHILADELPHIA STORY.  I'm so glad that this was the ""Sneak Peek"" choice at our local theater last evening.  Run don't walk to get in line for seeing this film in general release!  10 out of ten *'s !!",Serendipity

I left Serendipity with renewed hope for life, and it's hard for me to imagine anyone not cracking at least *one* smile in the entire 90 minutes of this film.And what's especially interesting is, the world was in turmoil in 2001 when the movie came out too, which could explain why the film was not always reviewed kindly by critics of the day. Fear and nihilism ruled the day in the America of the fall of 2001. It was difficult to have optimism in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and it's difficult to have optimism right as I speak, in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. And to get personal, it was difficult as hell for me to be optimistic the night I first saw this movie at age 17 in 2005...when it was shown in the psychiatric hospital I was in for suicidal ideation. But somehow, I was charmed enough to seek it out again 15 years later, when it made me smile again at a time when there was virtually nothing to smile about.Is this a great movie? No, it isn't. Is this an important movie? No it isn't. Can it, for people that allow it to, make you smile when the world seems to be one tragedy after another? Yes, it most certainly can.

And for the rest of the time when they're on their own THEY'RE BORING!Really the only saving graces for this movie are the performances of Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon.

But as a date movie, it works. I do find it a little like candy floss. It's sweet, looks nice, you look forward to it and as nice as it is, you just want something a little more substantial at the end.

92,paul-nemecek,A Fun Frolic,7,8 July 2018,"Roger Ebert is America's most powerful and most respected film critic. In fact, he is the only critic to win a Pulitzer Prize for film criticism. He has an encyclopedic grasp of film history and his writing is witty and full of insights. But sometimes he's wrong. For example, he thought Rocky IV was a great movie and that The Mission was completely undeserving of the critical acclaim it received. His response to Serendipity is the latest case in point.I am usually somewhat sympathetic to the charge of implausibility and a few too many coincidences in a film. This is Ebert's primary criticism. Serendipity, by its very title, takes fate and coincidence as its central theme. It is clear from the beginning that it takes this theme very lightly and with tongue firmly implanted in cheek. Implausibility is therefore a given.John Cusack plays Jon Trager, a New Yorker who meets Sara Thomas (Kate Beckinsale) while fighting over the same pair of gloves at Bloomingdales. They are immediately attracted to each other, but they are both involved with others at the time. The chemistry between them is clear from the beginning but Sara comes from the Doris Day school of destiny (as in ""que sera, sera-what will be, will be""). Sara has Jon write his number on a $5 dollar bill that she spends. If it comes back to her someday, she will know. She says that she will write her name and number in a book that she will sell to a used book dealer. If he finds it, he will know. Initially, this seems like an extremely creative kiss-off, but we are sure they are meant to be together.As in all romantic comedies, the suspenseful question is never will they get together. The question is always how. The suspense is built quite nicely and Cusack and Beckinsale have excellent help from interesting supporting characters. In many ways, this film reminds me of what we might get if we crossed Notting Hill with Sleepless in Seattle. Serendipity is directed by British director Peter Chelsom, but in plot and style it reminds me of the work of Nora Ephron (Sleepless in Seattle, When Harry Met Sally, You've Got Mail). This is the first screenplay for Marc Klein whose previous credits are mostly as assistant to the director for the film While You Were Sleeping.If you're looking for deep discussions, rent Memento on video or DVD. If you are interested in something fun, witty, and charming, Serendipity is worth a look. Roger Ebert is still my role model, but sometimes he just gets it wrong.",Serendipity
93,jason_13,"Different romance, but great anyway",8,16 February 2006,"Serendipity is one of the few romances that had some deeper meaning, were funny and were romantic enough. The movie is about Johnatan and Sarah who meet and feel something between them, but Saraha has unusual character. She believes that it is written for people to be together, so she wants destiny to show if she is ready for such a relationship and in fact Johnatan presses the same elevator number as Sarah, but a father and a boy stops the elevator and Johnatan doesn't come in time at the floor where Sarah is. Then things go wrong and Johnatan wants to meet Sarah again.This is the story of Serendipity. After these first 15 minutes I believe the movie becomes more comedy like with some really, really fresh lines and even hilarious moments and then back to a romantic story. The balance is kept and this helps the movie to succeed in what is supposed to be. Cuask and Beckinsale are great. I like both of them and both of them in a romantic story looks great. As I said there were indeed hidden messages although some clichés like what is love indeed what is the price of it or is it priceless, is it worth to do so many things just to find a strange girl which might not fall in love with you after all. It depends on characters. The movie is realistic most of all and it's much above most recent romance movies.And of course it might be considered simply as enjoyable and relivable, but if you are in mood, I suggest think more of what the movie is really trying to say.",Serendipity

Whatever.**SPOILERS** If there is even the smallest romantic bone in your body then I guarantee you will enjoy this one.  I think it will especially appeal to all those who liked NottingHill.  Not as funny as NH, but there again it doesn't go for the laughs that hard really.  The film has some serious points to make instead - about fate perhaps, but more about timing and the importance of risk taking.I'm a sucker for a love-at-first-sight-boy-loses-girl-boy-finds-girl-again type plots.  But this has the interesting twist of two people actually consciously throwing the chance of a relationship into the hands of destiny. The mechanics of this set up some fun and some tragedy as well - but perhaps you don't get as much of the passing of time and the sense of an itch that goes 'unscratched' in the intervening years as I'd have like to have seen.  I wonder if anything got cut ?  Both appear to have settled for 'Mr/Mrs Right when we catch up with them a few years later.  But it soon becomes apparent that each has kept the flame from their initial encounter alive - indeed right up until impending nuptials.  Well now destiny hoves into view with a vengeance and we get the best scenes in the movie.  Both his and hers method of passing on their contact details turn up at about the same time - but the one that got me - (and it will get you too my friend unless you've had a romantectomy recently) is the bride to be buying Johnathon the very copy of the book he'd been looking for all these years with the mystery girls tel no.  Really really sad - and Cussack handles the moment well.  I think its then that you know for sure this isnt just a lightweight romantic comedy.

The two main reasons are Kate Beckinsale (this is the movie where I got the crush on her I still have to this day), and Jeremy Piven.I like John Cusack in just about everything I've seen him in, and he does fine here as Jonathan Trager, who's obsessing over whether he let Sara (Beckinsale), the woman who could be the love of his life, get away from him by letting her talk him into this stupid idea of leaving their future to chance after fate brought them together in the first place. They have a chance meeting at a department store, which leads to an amazing evening. But then Sara wants to leave things to chance AGAIN by marking their information on a 5 dollar bill and a book and putting both out in circulation (there's also a ridiculous scene where they get on two elevators..if they end up on the same floor, they're supposed to be together). It's like..duh..fate already brought them together..after that you've got to do some of the work on your own.Fast forward to a few years later. Jonathan and Sara are both getting married (to different people, naturally), but neither can get that chance meeting out of their minds, and both set out on a last ditch effort to find each other. The lengths that Jonathan in particular goes to, with the help of his best friend Dean (Piven, the straw that stirs the drink in this), make for a couple of priceless scenes, including one with an anal retentive clerk at the department store (Eugene Levy).Piven is perfect as Dean, who helps Jonathan in his search despite the fact that he thinks his soon-to-be married buddy is off his rocker (what best friends do). Toward the end, when it looks like all is lost, Dean marvels at what Jonathan has gone through to find Sara. He laments about how the passion which Jonathan put into his search is something he let slip away in his own marriage.It's this, plus the chemistry between Cusack and Beckinsale, that make this movie worth seeing despite the ridiculously silly premise..and predictable ending.

They had amazing chemistry and the plot was very original and exciting. You are definitely cheering them on from the very beginning.This movie definitely makes you wonder about fate and the one who got away. You feel slight sympathy for the significant others that they leave but it is clear that they are not meant to be with them. It is a good message to those looking for true love and happiness, to never settle for less than someone who absolutely adores you.This is definitely one of my favorite romantic comedies of all time, one that you can just watch over and over.

Yes, the plot has the writer pulling all kinds of ""destiny"" strings to weave a fun, light, romantic story. That is forgiven for the joy I get at every viewing. The basic premise is of two star-crossed lovers who are meant to be together with their human beliefs pushing them apart while the rest of the universe is trying to push them back together where they belong. It is so much fun watching this special pairing of John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale at their all-time best.This is classic John Cusack - the tortured, intelligent soul who falls for the perfect girl, then watches her disappear by her own ""destiny"" devices which crushes him. Five years later, he's engaged to someone else but can never get his perceived soul-mate out of his mind. There are times where Cusack (whom I adore) will overact/appear schizophrenic and sociopathic in some romantic comedies. This, however, is one of his best. He's simply believable and sympathetic in his quest to put right what went wrong so many years before.Kate Beckinsale --- With the exception of her character's ""destiny-speak"" at the opening, she's the most perfect leading lady in which Cusack will drop anything (and actually, everything if you think about it) to finally track down and begin a life together. Charming, beautiful, intelligent, flawed, strong... She's exceptional.Now, add Molly Shannon and Jeremy Piven as the equally-neurotic best friends of both our heroes, plus the added joy of watching the ever-reliable funnyman, Eugene Levy, stealing every scene in the Bloomingdale's search... The casting director deserves an honorary ""Well done!"" for their choices. Throw in the amazing New York skyline and Central Park in all it's splendor...This movie may not be perfect. But if you are thinking of watching a movie with your significant other to make you laugh, cry, hold onto one another in a romantic embrace so they never, ever go away... This is that movie. It never gets old. It seems fresh every time I see it. A great example was my 14yo foster daughter watching this for the first time. Her reaction as the lead characters miss each other by inches once again was - ""I HATE this movie!!!""... Only to have her at the end tell me how much she LOVED the movie. It was awesome!!It isn't perfect, but compared to all the recent ""The Notebook""-knockoffs filling up movie theaters and video rentals at an alarming rate considering they are neither good NOR romantic, I'd recommend renting this again simply for the ""feel-good"" factor. 9 out of 10 for sheer pleasantness and simplicity that makes me smile at the end every time.",Serendipity

Kate Beckinsale plays a starry-eyed moron who drifts through life trying to read signs in everything that happens around her, like Jim Carrey did in that movie The Number 23. But this movie doesn't paint her as a dangerous obsessive compulsive, or a psychopath, it paints her as a kind of free spirited saint who can do no wrong, full of giddy wisdom and kindness.John Cusack plays a John Cusack character, which means he is good looking and quiet except for little fits now and then. He meets her at a mall, they fall in love at first sight, but instead of making plans to see each other again, she writes his number on a $5 and spends it, telling him that when that bill ""finds its way back to her"", she'll call him.Any normal man would see her as insane and just walk away, but not John Cusack, because this is a movie. He is immediately infected with the same obsessive compulsiveness as she, and looks for signs in everything, and looks for faults in his innocent fiancée (who does not deserve to be put through this garbage just because he is disloyal and unfaithful).Beckinsale has a weird beatnik musician fiancée who is absolutely perfect for her, but she is constantly testing his every action to see if the universe is telling her to dump him. She is appalled at every fault she finds in him.These two undestined lovers get it in their heads that they are destined, they ruin their fiancée's lives, and run around like idiots trying to find each other without trying, if that makes any sense. I know what would happen in real life to people who did stuff like this: they would spiral into depression and go begging their fiancees to take them back and be refused, or they would find each other and then have to break up the first time some unpleasant thing randomly happened to her (because it would be a ""sign"").

I've seen many of his films in my childhood. As for John Cusack... I've always had a huge crush on him. His height, cute face, voice, everything about him. Just perfect. Kate Beckinsale is such a lovely actress too! The cameo of Eugene Levy (so 00s) was hilarious!When I finished watching this film, I had weird positive, beautiful vibes. And I'm saying weird, because of its aura. I'm a very nostalgic person, that when I'm watching 00s, 90s and older films (especially 00s) I feel that I just want to cry.

108,ashi-lance,Good one -Recommended!,7,6 February 2013,"A nice little romantic comedy starring two charismatic leads. It is in fact the chemistry between stars John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale that makes this film as watchable as it is. They are great in this and that allows you to ignore some silly plot developments. John Cusack is irresistible as Jonathan in this divine romance farce. The following cast is phenomenal. One of the good movies in romantic genre, Serendipity will inspire the viewer to believe in destiny. Jonathan (John Cusack) and Sara (Kate Beckinsale) meet in Bloomingdales when they both want to purchase the same pair of gloves. The attraction is instant and they spend a romantic evening cavorting around New York City together. At the end of the evening John wants to see her again, but Sara decides that if it is fate that they should be together, they will find each other again. She drives away in a cab and he never sees her again. Well, almost never.Years go by and both of them are about to be married, but each still has this nagging feeling that the other was his/her one true love. Of course fate conspires to bring them back together (after about a dozen near misses) as they each simultaneously undertake one last attempt to find one another just before they get married to someone else.The fate angle is plowed mercilessly, almost to the point of nausea, but the skits are funny and the chemistry between Cusack and Beckinsale is enchanting. Cusack is an expert at playing the tortured and neurotic lover, but here he is more haunted and forlorn than dysfunctional. Kate Beckinsale rocketed from obscurity to prominence with her performance in 'Pearl Harbor' and proves to be a wonderful romantic lead in this film. The film also benefits from outstanding comedic support from Jeremy Piven as Jonathan's best friend and devoted Sara sleuth. Piven's zany comedy proves to be the perfect complement to Cusack's wry despondency. Eugene Levy is a scream as the eccentric Bloomingdales salesman, who blackmails Jonathan into buying half the store to give him information from Sara's charge account. Serendipity is a lovely light-hearted comedy which will be enjoyed by everyone, especially if you're into romantic comedies. The good thing with the movie is, it's not that predictable like many other movies out there. Okay, fine we all know that at the end of the movie, Sara and Jonathan will get together, but the way they do is quite different then you may expect. The movie has loads of little twists and turns all the way, which makes the movie good and it keeps you interested almost all the way through. My Rating – 7/10",Serendipity

It has 91 minutes of runtime, but it took more than two hours for me to finish it because almost each scene reminded me of something, therefore, I constantly needed to stop the film and take notes. So, in this review I am going to write mostly about those notes and thoughts.I had a couple of interactions with John Cusack in films like, 2012, 1403 and Hot Tub Time Machine, and decided that I don't really like his way of acting. He always seems cold and distant. I always failed to have a connection with him. ""Serendipity"" is the film where I made peace with him. Even though it is not a performance oriented film, I have enjoyed the chemistry between him and Kate Beckinsale. ""Serendipity"" is directed by Peter Chelsom. It was made with a budget of $28 Million and grossed around $77.5 Million. Even though it was made in the beginning of the 21st century, 2001, it still has the clear and relaxing atmosphere of the 90s romantic and comedies. ""Serendipity"" is a spiritually beautiful film just like its name. I didn't know the meaning of Serendipity, and after the film, I checked and found the following description; ""the occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way."" Now the name makes perfect sense compared with its story.As I have mentioned above, ""Serendipity"" was made in 2001. Back then, English actress Kate Beckinsale was 28 years old. In one of the scenes Jonathan's (John Cusack) best friend tells him that ""British women do not age well."" Today, in the year 2018, Kate Beckinsale is 45 years old and still incredibly beautiful. Jonathan's best friend's statement is probably the only thing that is wrong about this film. Because of the high-level predictability, I found the story a bit boring. But, extremely romantic scenes, in the most unexpected times, made it up to me. It is a well-balanced film, and intended to be made with good and happy thoughts. I am one of those people who believe nothing really bad happens during the Christmas time. ""Serendipity"" starts in one of those peaceful moments in Christmas where everyone shops for their loved ones. So, based on my early theory, this film is going to be calm, good and peaceful. At the end of the film, I was proud to see that my theory turned out to be true. It was indeed calm, good and peaceful. In one of the scenes Sara (Kate Beckinsale) explains what a soul mate really means. She says that ""I honestly think it's dangerous to use term ""soul mate"". It implies there's some magical element that we have no control over like fate or destiny. I think holding onto beliefs like that stops us doing the real work."" She agrees for the fact that this is a special term and must be used only about someone really special. She tries to protect this special term from turning out to be like ""I Love You"" which, unfortunately, lost all its meaning long time ago and became a meaningless, empty statement. Sara is a woman who still believes in special things like love, fate, destiny and soul mate. This is the inner beauty of Sara, this is the beauty of ""Serendipity.""Both Jonathan and Sara have ideal partners who love and adore them, but when something doesn't supposed to happen, it is not going to happen. No matter how perfect things may seem, if those things are not in your destiny, they are not going to happen, or on the contrary, if something is meant to happen, it will happen no matter what. You may agree on this or not, but this is the only message ""Serendipity"" believes in, and shares with you. That being said, when you are making a film based on destiny, then you really need a character like Sara. In this point of view, character profiles are one of the strongest point of the film, as well as the beautiful soundtracks which are mandatory for a film like this.""Serendipity"" is going to shake some things up in your soul. It is a great film for a cold and rainy evening, and even a perfect one for the Christmas time. I had a lot of fun watching it. It is going to make you believe in something. After all, maybe I was destined to watch this film tonight. Who knows?",Serendipity
112,screamer-13,My expertly written comments on Serendipity,9,3 January 2002,"The plot of Serendipity is nothing if not predictable. The premise feels like it has been done a hundred times before, or at least cobbled together from a dozen similar films.However, Serendipity has two great things: Kate Beckinsale, and Manhattan; and I can thereby forgive it all its potential flaws. Both of the above ""objets de beauté"" are shown in the perfect light - they sparkle on the screen, full of colour and life. I am currently in love with them both, and expect to be for some time.There are some silly characters and daft acting, but there is enough chemistry between Cusack and Beckinsale in the first 15 minutes to make the premise work. The intricacies of the plot are equally silly, but mostly in a cute way. The director also knows how to break up a film in an artistic way with some really nice time-lapse establishing shots and upbeat musical interludes to keep our chestnuts roasting nicely.The film as a whole is something to treasure - very simple, very light, but well-crafted and beautifully made with a real loving touch from the director. If you liked this, watch Forces of Nature with Sandra Bullock and Ben Affleck - a very similar film in many ways. And vice-versa of course.",Serendipity
113,westley34,Movie felt hauntingly familiar,9,25 May 2021,"This wonderful movie is about two soulmates being brought together briefly, then pining for each other for years. It is a magical movie that inspires hope for those who want to keep hope and magic alive. It particularly hit home for me as I experienced something similar in Woolworths many years ago. Many people that watched this felt that the coincidences in the movie are fake or outlandish, but they felt real to me as I live very similar things.

114,he_who_leads,"So Lightweight, It Could Sit On Your Head and You Wouldn't Notice",3,5 March 2007,"I saw this film a few years ago. I'm a little hazy on it, but I want to say to people what I remember feeling - this is a bad film. Don't see it.I don't understand how anybody could like this film. It's premise is annoying, and its execution is completely tedious. The two leads meet and decide that they have good chemistry. So what do they do? They decide to walk away and completely leave it to fate if they are to meet again. Hasn't anybody told these people that time is precious? Most people have enough trouble meeting a promising partner in the first place. So the rest of the film is will they meet or won't they? They just miss each other over and over and over and over and over and over again. That's the plot. It's like watching a bad dart player trying to get a bullseye. Almost ... try again ... not bad ... too bad ... focus ....... you get the idea. I know a lot of romantic comedies are very light and fluffy but this is like trying to satisfy hunger with parsley and cordial.So without a decent plot or structure, the film is destined to fail. It's not as if the cast and crew are incompetent, but the film is just so undemanding, that you will find no satisfaction or reward in watching it. Or maybe you will. Some seem to like it. I suppose some people feel that all they are in the mood for is a romantic comedy as light as a feather. Only in that case, go ahead.",Serendipity
115,coyets,Unusual tale well told,7,23 January 2006,"The big, positive feature of this film, apart from the appealing and somewhat unusual storyline, in which serendipity plays no small part, is the portrayal of Sara Thomas by Kate Beckinsale.Although the story is not one that cannot be accepted as real, and the belief in fate, which forms an essential part of it, is extremely irritating as love gets pushed into the background by philosophy, the telling of the tale makes it compelling and entertaining. However, whilst retaining far more homogeneity and continuity as 'When Harry met Sally', and being better paced in the unfolding of the drama, it does not match up to the best films of this genre, such as 'Conte d'hiver'.Kate Beckinsale dominates the film almost as much as Charlotte Véry dominated 'Conte d'hiver'. As much as the development of the story makes the viewer want to know how it continues, Kate Beckinsale holds the interest within each scene in which she appears with a magnificent portrayal of a normal person with a mixture of strengths and weaknesses.Films of this type often seem to be travelling towards a rather obvious conclusion, but this is also handled rather skilfully, so that the viewer has a satisfied feeling of not having experienced the end before it occurs.It is a very enjoyable, though not top class, film, with earnestness rationed so that one may be better engrossed by the light-heartedness.",Serendipity
116,Jisk,A fun romance,5,7 October 2001,"a perfect date movie. There are some plot-holes however. I won't give anything away but some things are just too far fetched to be believable.

117,awerling,Confusing juxtaposition of purposes,2,30 October 2001,"Most of the time, Serendipity is an unconvincing romance that is so uncertain about its main theme -- that one's soul mate is a matter of fate, no matter the odds -- that it bludgeons the viewer with it using a sledgehammer.  Rather than melting into the film's sentimentality, I felt cornered by it, like a dog trapped in a corner.At other times, this movie is hysterical, with ridiculously funny scenes mostly involving a department store clerk.  These scenes seemed out of place here, as if they belonged in some other, better movie.The quality of the acting and the purity of purpose are irrelevant factors when all is said and done.  Serendipity simply feels like an English 101 theme paper on film.  ""Here's an example of serendipity.""  It needs fleshed out.  Most of all, it screams for subtlety.",Serendipity

The music sometimes really works, but mostly works against the events of the scenes in the film. Nobody really knows how to do screwball romantic comedies anymore - too bad because the script must have been great for the reported $500,000 it fetched, and this could have been a great film.

120,say_andy,A clichéd romantic comedy that works in spite of itself,8,29 July 2005,"Serendipity is light and delightful, a romantic comedy that is both crowd-pleasing and cute, without being trite and simple. Sure, it has all the romantic comedy contrivances, and relies on a series of clichéd coincidences and well-worn shots of New York to get the audience to the satisfying ending. It by no means has re-invented the wheel here. Instead, it's just an above average wheel, one that you'll enjoy if you buy into the formula.The main reason why this film works where other romantic comedies fail is the cast. John Cusack proves there is no movie he can't class up by his presence, being the guy that women find attractive and smart, while guys identify with. He's the everyman for the hipster crowd. Cusack's Jonathan Trager is a funny, self-deprecating, engaging lead whose charisma carries the film. The gorgeous Kate Beckinsale plays Sara Thomas, the object of Trager's affection, being the cute, funny hot girl that would make a guy gladly jump through all the crazy hoops she places in front of him for a shot at her affections. They are both affable leads with solid chemistry that clicks well enough and fast enough that the audience becomes reasonably invested in their separate pursuits of each other through the rest of the movie (as they spend most of the movie apart from one another).Cusack's best friend Jeremy Piven plays the same best friend character he does in most of Cusack's movies, this time as Dean Kansky. As much chemistry as Cusack and Beckinsale manage in this movie, it can't help to match the chemistry Cusack and Piven have. It's their antics in the movie that cause Serendipity to rise above the otherwise average romantic comedy it should be, as they manage to be truly funny without resorting to the usual bumbling moron buddy tricks that lesser comedies fall back on. Adding to the mix is Eugene Levy, who steals every scene he's in as a Bloomington's Salesman who helps Trager and Kansky track down Sara.Another reason this movie stands out for me is that the respective significant others for Cusack and Beckinsale in the movie are both perfectly good people who care for their partners. Too often in movies like this one, the significant others that keep the main couple apart are portrayed as unlikeable people, the women are mousey shrews or controlling bitches, and the men are complete jerks. This is designed to make the audience cheer harder for the main couple to eventually get together. Unfortunately, it ends up making the main characters look stupid. Why would these people choose such beasts to be their girlfriend/boyfriend/fiancée? Are they that blind? Not so with Serendipity, where Bridget Moynahan brings a sweetness and genuine concern to Trager's fiancée Halley Buchanen and John Corbett does the same with Thomas' fiancée Lars Hammond. Corbett does a great comedic job with Hammond, a new age musician in the Yanni mold, who is a little weird and a little preoccupied with his career, but still a loving boyfriend. It's not that their other loves aren't good people, it's just that they're not the right people.I've watched this movie dozens of times now, and it only grows on me more each time. I still laugh out loud at many parts in the movie, and am always won over by the characters and the pursuit each time. In the hands of lesser performers, there's a good chance that it would be terrible. But it's not, it's simple and winning, even Molly Shannon is tolerable in it, playing a toned down version of the same character she always plays, this time as Sara's best friend Eve. If you're looking for a nice, warm romantic comedy, but aren't willing to accept the usual dumbed down offerings of the genre, than Serendipity is an excellent choice.",Serendipity
121,allfunandgames,Average!,5,3 October 2002,"The average romantic comedy suffers from one undeniable problem; the ending is a forgone conclusion.  What is meant to makes them fun, however, are the characters and the way that the plot takes them to this predetermined finale.The main fault with Serendipity is that while Cusack and Beckinsale do a decent job in their characterizations, after the initial setup, the movie just meanders and the script can't keep up with the talented lead and supporting cast.

The problem is that both already had a significant others. So they played a game of fate to see if they will wind up with each other.This is one of the most corniest movie, but IT WORKS! Thanks mostly to the performances of John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale and the anticipation that was build up along the story and the screwy supporting cast of Eugene Levy, Molly Shannon, and Jeremy Piven. Kate Beckinsale was rightly casted as herself a British instead making her an American as in many of her other movies. There were problems with the story though, like how their respective significant others were handled in the story. Since this is a fantasy, the focus is on them both and only them both. It is far from being a great movie. Personally, I enjoyed it and the sweet moments were very nicely done.",Serendipity

What we needed was a Sandra Bullock who shines in romantic comedy. This movie went from a shaky start to a poor middle and apart from a good comic performance by Eugene Levy as a store clerk there was no relief in sight. It's a pity Mr Levy, who co-wrote this script, couldn't make some more sympathetic characters. I believe John Cusack could be a fine romantic comedy actor.

Add to that his spending the time before his wedding chasing someone else - that firmly nails the coffin on any identification I could possibly have had with this character.

Molly Shannon's good acting (as Beckingsale's friend Eve) and Alan Sylvestri's passable music score are cancelled out by the sadistically bad acting, painfully raw direction, and incoherent editing. The film's unrefined quasi-religious escapism might strike a note with atrophied juveniles, but will probably alienate everyone else, including Cusack's and Beckingsale's fans.

And yes, Kate Beckinsale's beautiful face.
WHO CARES.
She sure does not deserve any money from this, nobody associated with it does.The most hideous movie;
two people meet
and the girl - she's not mature enough to call a woman -
plays these games to determine if they were ""destined"" to be together,
and not with who they're with.
So a simple small amount of time getting stuck in an elevator prevents them from being together.
Then, fast-forward several YEARS - seven, I believe it was -
and they're both engaged to others;
and of course, they're still THINKING about each other, from the few hours they spent together from ONE night.
Oh and there's a lost $5 bill with his name and number on it, and a lost copy of Love In The Time Of Cholera with her name and number (this movie is as real as the 555 number we get to see).
And of course, after all those years, they get together, but first she finds the guy from Northern Exposure who she's engaged to who plays this horrible Indian music, she realizes they're not right for each other, just as he - with his friend Jeremy Piven (seeing his name in the opening credits was a bad omen) - they catch his own bride-to-be with another guy the night before they're supposed to be married, so he (Cusack) calls it off, and then Jon and Kate - whatever their names are - oh, hers is Sara - they even have the song played in this - ridiculous - they're celebrating their anniversary at the end.There's no logic to this movie.

137,amarv,A good love story set amongst unbelievable probabilities.,9,20 April 2010,"How many of us doesn't like a good love story with some humour & some melancholy. I think the rom-coms of the 30s, 40s & 50s are amongst the best in Hollywood history. We have such precious gems such as Adam's Rib, Roman Holiday, It Happened One Night, My Man Friday & the list goes on. The next 3 decades saw a decline in this genre save some rare exceptions such as Annie Hall. But the last 2 decades saw a revival of sorts. I think the success of When Harry Met Sally & Pretty Woman has a lot to do with this.I like many rom-coms from the last 2 decades but if you ask me to name 3 movies that I absolutely adore from the last 21 years, I would say 10 Things I Hate About You, My Sassy Girl (not the English version but the Korean version Yeopgijeogin Geunyeo) & Serendipity.I actually saw Serendipity for the 1st time only a year after its release. At that time I haven't seen many rom-coms & also I wasn't thinking about movies in a critical way analysing their good, bad & ugly. It was just some rom-com which I was seeing to waste some time. But by the first 15 minutes, I started to love the movie. Partly because of the interesting start but more importantly due to Kate Beckinsale about whom I never heard of before & who will always remain my 1st Hollywood crush.Serendipity is directed by Peter Chelsom & written by Marc Klein. While shopping for Christmas, strangers Jonathan Trager (John Cusack) & Sara Thomas (Kate Beckinsale) try to buy the same pair of gloves at a store. After Jonathen gives them to her, they feel some kind of attraction towards each other although they already have their lovers. So they spend some time with each other by eating & skating. When the shamelessly flirting Jonathan proposes to exchange their numbers, Sara has a better idea. She makes him write his name & number on a $5 note & gives that note in a shop. She says that she will write her name & number on a book that she will sell the next day. So if they are destined to be with each other, they will find other's contact someday. They leave each other after this AMAZING BRILLIANT idea.After a few years, Jonathan is engaged to Halley Buchanan (Bridget Moynahan) & Sara is about to get engaged to Lars Hammond (John Corbett). All these years they do think about each other but they don't even know their full names to find each other. After seeing some 'signs', both of them decide to try for one last time to find each other. Jonathan has his friend Dean Kansky (Jeremy Piven) to help him & Sara has her friend Eve (Molly Shannon). Do they find each other? If so will they leave their respective partners who are such good people? See the movie for answers although I know anybody could guess what happens at the end of a rom-com.John Cusack & Kate Beckinsale have very little screen time together but whenever they do share a scene they share good chemistry. Their roles are not meant to win an Oscar & they deliver what's required. The best part in acting comes from the supporting cast. I loved the role of Dean Kansky. Molly Shannon as Eve was also very good. Eugene Levy has a very funny cameo as sales man in the movie.Another thing for which I like the movie so much is its score. It is composed by 2 time Academy award nominated Alan Silvestri who is one of the busiest in the business. This is not his best by any means. He has given background to such movies as Forrest Gump, Back to the Future series, The Polar Express amongst others. But the music in Serendipity is different & it caught my attention.If at all there is one thing to improve, it is the dialogue of the movie. It is kind of mishmash wherein some scenes I like it & in some other scenes I hate. Some of the dialogue at the start is so sugary that you wouldn't eat anything sweet for a few hours.Coming to the story, the only problem with the story is the probability of its occurrences. It's all fate fate fate fate in the movie. In fact IMDb has this movie under fantasy genre & rightly so. You would never see so many coincidences in a story to move it forward. They could have mentioned in the movie that the main purpose & existence of the universe is to somehow unite Jonathan & Sara. If you don't give much thought to the improbability of the story, you will definitely enjoy this.Many of you may disagree with my rating, but it's like a first love to me where the good things always appear magnified & the faults diminished.Love to hear what you have to say about Serendipity, http://amarsmoviejournal.blogspot.com/",Serendipity
138,soccer64,Serendipity- Stunning and Stupefying,8,23 December 2005,"This movie had the same story as Wicker Park (and I'm sure a bunch of other stories that I just haven't seen as recently)- girl meets a guy, they arrange to meet somewhere but can't find each other so they each go their separate ways for a few years, then both of them get engaged but suddenly ""destiny"" steps in and makes them NEED to find and see each other again before they are married, and I think we all can see where that is going. Not that this story makes a bad movie, I really enjoyed the movie, I'm just saying it's been done before, was done afterward, and I'm sure will be done again.I suppose I shall now contrast Serendipity and Wicker Park since I have reviewed WP as well. There weren't any ""freaky"" scenes in the movie like there was in Wicker Park, which was better for me because I really don't care to see all of that. The music in Serendipity was good, however it certainly was no ""(The) Scientist"".The only reasons I did not give Serendipity the same rating (or more than) as Wicker Park was not because of the acting or the story, but more towards the directing side. Paul McGuigan did an unreal job of directing Wicker Park and the way he was able to clearly (if you really think about it-and pay attention) tell almost the whole story backwards. Serendipity is simple, to the point, and...not...backwards, which is probably a good thing for people who don't have a long attention span, or time to sit and watch the whole movie at once. Serendipity also had more comedy in it than WP. All in all, I'd say that if you like either of these movies, you should give the other a try.Kate Beckinsale was a wonderful actress, as in any movies I have yet to see her in (PEARL HARBOR!! YEAH!!! WOO!!!!), and she's so beautiful! I was also very pleased with Jeremy Piven's job in the movie. He did a great job acting as the encouraging tag-along best friend.""Life is not merely a series of meaningless accidents or coincidences, but rather it's a tapestry of events that culminate in an exquisite, sublime plan."" I found it almost funny that we just-so-happened to watch this movie on December 23rd, and the beginning and the ending of the movie was Christmastime...who knows, maybe it was fate? ;)",Serendipity
139,drjlo,Golden Age of Romantic Comedy,7,16 October 2015,"Being a fan of both Beckingsale and Cusack, this 2001 romantic comedy had a good shot of being liked by me. Beckingsale has been in many movies since, but I am not sure she has ever been this impossibly irresistible. While the script does take liberties with the character's at-times strange ideas and actions, she has the type of screen presence and burning magnetism that seem to reach out straight to the viewer's senses. The eyes, face, the accent, and that ebullient spirit! Cusack does what he does best, offering the tiny-bit off-beat, tiny-bit different viewing angle to the character's motives and personality. I am glad Cusack played off Beckingsale, not some pretty boy actor who can't act or bring something special to the chemistry. Yes, the suspension of disbelief needs to be strong in action for the viewer, but despite sometimes unrealistic actions and silly meanderings, this is one of my favorite romantic comedies of all time, and too bad they don't make them like this anymore..",Serendipity

But it was a long flight and she assured me it was a good choice.Well, Kate was great in ""Serendipity"", as was John Cusack.  You felt a chemistry between them from the moment they meet in a department store and fight over the same glove.

In all my years, there is one movie that has ever brought me to tears. Although, it is an otherwise happy, though at times, heart wrenchingly suspenseful film, the story means a great deal to me, having experienced a like circumstance in my own life... I am still awaiting the Hollywood ending.Most people believe in fate, to a point, but I never did. This was fact until my own experience that seemed as though it was right out of the movie. Even now, I cannot watch the movie without pining on every scene, silently urging the film forward to the final beautiful scene. The romantic interludes still provoke me to smile, and the drama still makes me cry.Though this is not my favorite movie, due to an understandable history, it is still the one I watch with a bowl of ice cream, and a bottle of Grand Marnier, whenever I feel depressed or nostalgic.For the few of you out there who have found your true love, please, sit with the other half of your soul, drink a bottle of wine, eat some pasta, and watch this movie from start to finish, and do not miss a single scene.

Kate Beckinsale is as charming as ever, and John Cusack suits well for the leading role.  But above all, I thought the two of them had good chemistry.  The movie itself is simple and predictable.  However, it's simple enough for you to sit back and enjoy as if you're reading a fairy tale. *****  WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!! ***** Although the two leads had good chemistry, I thought they did not share enough scenes together in the earlier part of the film.  I was actually reminded of the teen flick, 'Can't hardly wait' in the middle of the movie.

152,brimatt2412,Unlikable main characters sink the movie,1,25 June 2008,"I like romantic comedies, (My Big Fat Greek Wedding, My Best Friend's Wedding, Pretty Woman are some favorites of mine), so I am not writing this out of any hate whatsoever for the idea of a romantic comedy.Having said that, this movie ticked me off. The main characters, how do I say this in a family friendly forum, were jerks to put it mildly. The movie's obvious goal was to make me like them and root for them to wind up together. But by the end of the movie, I saw them as the villains with the way they treated their fiancées. But I've gotten ahead of myself here, my bad, my apologies.The premise of the movie is that John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale meet at a store at the beginning of the movie and hit it off (both characters were stated as currently dating others at the time, establishing what would an annoying pattern of behavior throughout the film.) Beckinsale's flaky character suggests writing their numbers on a 5 dollar bill and a book and if they come across them, they were meant to be together.Some time later, Cusack is engaged to Bridget Moynahan and Beckinsale is engaged to John Corbett's character. Both of the fiancé's are decent and don't deserve the treatment they get from our villai- I mean main characters, so sorry. Cusack spends the whole of his week before he is supposed to be married looking for that book with Beckinsale's number and Beckinsale isn't much better. Their callous disregard for their fiancé's caused me to lose any interest to care about them. I felt particularly bad for Bridget Moynahan's character, who proved to be a nice and lovely fiancé who really loved Cusack's character, yet was set up for heartbreak. The end of the movie evoked sympathy for the supporting character fiancé's and rage at the main characters, who I saw having no redeeming qualities.As I said, I enjoy romantic comedies when they are well done. Part of well done means making the main characters likable to the point where you are rooting for them to get together and you cheer at the end when/if the happy ending comes.Here, the main characters, I thought were self-absorbed inconsiderate people who I pretty much considered villains at the end. So to me, this particular romantic comedy failed on its goal.I do not recommend this movie. (as if I had left any doubt to my feelings in my review)",Serendipity

If they strangers had met and fallen in love, why purse their love again so many years later after being happily engaged?

157,fmcchris,A flawed premise equals a flawed movie.,3,29 December 2011,"Telling a lie requires you to invent more lies to sustain the original untruth. Likewise, an implausible premise requires abundant fictions to keep the story going--often into even more absurd realms. The premise of ""Serendipity"" is that it is not you who determines your own destiny; rather it is fate that makes the determination as to how your life will play out. Consider Sara's retort to Jonathan just after they meet and he wants to get her name and phone number:Jonathan: I just had a really great time and for all we know I wouldn't be able to find you again.Sara: Well, if we're meant to meet again, we'll meet again. It's just not the right time now. Now how does Sara know what the RIGHT time is? She doesn't, so she's going to let fate decide. How droll!The doctrine of fatalism is a flawed doctrine which states that all events are fixed in advance so that we are powerless to change them. People are merely pieces on a chessboard, manipulated by some supernatural power--all choice has been removed from the equation and we have no recourse but to submit ourselves to the will of some external agency. At one point in the movie, Sara's friend Courtney told her as much, and that was the closest we come to ANY truth in this movie. But the premise must be maintained at all costs, and so once the two main characters part, all kinds of fatalistic events occur as if on cue to help them find one another again--the five dollar bill with Jonathan's name on it, the book with Sara's phone number in it, etc. The list of improbabilities increases as the movie descends into utter ludicrousness.One particularly distasteful aspect of this movie was the shallowness of the lead characters. When Jonathan and Sara first met, they were both involved with other people. And those other people, we come to find out, are very nice people who are in love with our main characters. Well it seems to me that Jonathan and Sara can't be too happy with their respective relationships if they are flirting with one another! And if they had any misgivings, then it would have been honest of them both to let their significant others in on the secret instead of leading them on in such a disingenuous fashion--especially since those significant others were good and decent people who truly loved them. To string someone along to the point where you've convinced that person that you want to marry him or her, but to pine away for someone else and then end the relationship at the last moment is not only cowardly and dishonest—it is cruel. But why settle for second best when fate has decreed otherwise? Given the above, it was impossible for me to like Jonathan and Sara. All I felt was contempt for their willingness to submit to fate and to not take the responsibility for their actions into their own hands. If I had met a girl whom I thought could be the love of my life (and I sincerely doubt such a thing would happen during a brief interlude in a department store as it did in the movie!), you can bet your bottom dollar that I would NEVER, EVER leave anything up to chance! I would have asked that girl for her phone number and would not have left her without it. Unless of course she was a girl like Sara, in which case I probably would have had no choice but to let fate decide. After all, she did say ""it's just not the right time now."" Sure babe. Sure.To cap off the succession of absurdities, there was no emotional payoff at the end of the movie. Jonathan and Sara shake hands when they finally meet followed by a weak and unconvincing kiss. You would think after two years of constantly thinking about one another and trying desperately to reconnect, that our lovers would have rushed into each other's arms and shouted for joy. But no! They simply stand next to each other on the ice rink looking cold and bemused. But then, considering the flawed script and all the fatalistic occurrences that permeate every inch of this ridiculous movie, I can only believe that it was fated to be this way.",Serendipity
158,focusakker,Serendipity's Musketeers,8,28 August 2007,"Hey, there, kids, I'm New York's own Amplification Warrior, here to tell you about a movie called Serendipity.In the movie, Jonathan (John Cusack) and Sara (the ever-so-beautiful Kate Beckinsale) meet by serendipity, which of course is the name of this movie. The movie takes place in the greatest city in the world, New York City. It is Christmas Eve, and the couple meet in Bloomingdale's. Unfortunately the wedding they are about to plan was canceled. Oy, what a shame, kids.Incidentally this movie is associated with 3 Musketeers candy bars for two reasons: 1. I watch a Serendipity video for Nickelback's ""Far Away"" for every 3 Musketeers bar I eat.2. In the song, ""Never a Day,"" a boy screams ""3 Musketeers! Big on chocolate, not on fat!""

159,setheisenberg,A Good Dessert Movie,8,7 October 2001,"Ok. Let's make one thing clear from the top: this movie is like lemon meringue--tasty but certainly not nutritious or filling. But then again, it's not supposed to be. Those in search of a well-crafted dramatic theatrical feast, should crank up their surround-sound systems and rent `The Matrix.'That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie-plot-holes and all. I find it easier to accept such holes in romantic comedies than in dramas like `Don't Say A Word,' a film with enough perforations to make it the culinary equivalent of Swiss Cheese.A number of things worked well in this film, and yes, a number did not. In the beginning of the movie as the plot is being set up, Beckinsale's Sara is a bit quick to shove the wheels of fate into motion. Missing is any substantial display of guilt, particularly since she and Cusack's Jonathan had already crossed the line by going out for dessert even though both were in committed relationships. The book, the $5 bill, and the gloves were all obvious plot devices, destined to return later in the third reel. However, the elevator sequence was just plain silly, seemingly stolen from a second-class sit-com. Still, if Cusack and Beckinsale had followed their hearts (and logic), the movie would have ended within the first ten minutes.Other reviewers have complained about the seeming lack of chemistry between the main characters. However, the inherent nature of the plot handicaps them because they spend the bulk of the movie APART. Their scenes together, the opening sequence and then the closing moments, are just that-moments. There's more on-screen bonding between Cusack and his best friend, played by Jeremy Piven, than between our star-crossed lovers. But that doesn't matter. `Sleepless in Seattle' and `You've Got Mail' also suffered from this trap, and it's difficult to resolve when the plot keeps (or pushes) the leads apart.I also had some difficulty with: (1) the amount of time each of them were able to take off from work, (2) the absence of any indication that these two people have a life outside of their soul mate pursuit, (something nicely written into Hugh Grant's character in `Notting Hill,'), (3) the lack of chemistry between Cusack and Bridget Moynahan, his fiancé, (4) Jon Corbett's Kenny G-like character (is this a New Age stereotype or just a week parody?) (5) Eugene Levy's flagrant disregard for invasion of privacy issues (The commission from Cusack's purchases wouldn't have even covered the retainer for Levy's attorney), (6) why oh why New York again? There are a dozen other cities aching to provide a backdrop for a romantic comedy, and (7) the movie could have ended quite satisfyingly on the ice skating rink without resorting to more of Levy's Bloomingdale shtick.In spite of those nitpicks, I very much enjoyed the romantic escapism of the film. I was so relieved that the plot did not require the lovers to sleep together in order to ignite their passion. In addition, I found the writing to be witty and funny without being obnoxiously cute, and without hurling unrealistic `people never really say that' sit-com one-liners at us.If it seems as if this review contains more nitpicks than accolades, it is only because it is easy to quantify the miscues by applying logic to a plot. But suspension of disbelief in this genre requires a bit more tolerance than in `real-life dramas.' Romantic comedies don't attempt to imitate life. They attempt to capitalize on our hopes, our fantasies, our need to believe in love and being loved. Real life seldom contains all of those ingredients-at least in sufficient quantities to sustain a 90 minute movie or make a 5-course meal. Taken for what this film sets out to accomplish, it is as satisfying as any dessert should be. (8 out of 10)",Serendipity

You know why? This is SO very much a movie you wanna see with a girl you like!Even before I saw it, I knew this movie had to have a heart, I felt so good after I watched it, I knew I wanted a girlfriend more than ever! It's so romantic, but then again: the label Romantic Comedy is not entirely real. There's a light percentage of comedy throughout this movie, but don't expect a There's Something About Mary, because that's one romantic comedy to the fullest. This is something of an entire different caliber, but it hits you where you want it to.Even though they spend like, 30 minutes together in the movie, in true Hollywood style, you KNOW they end up together. There's DEFINITELY chemistry between Kate and Jon, and they make a great couple. Since this movie, I so want Kate in more romantic comedies, she has such a wonderful onscreen presence, she stole my heart with this movie.Even though you know they end up together during the end of the movie, it will keep you wanting to know when they end up together. The directing is wonderful, and you feel sorry that Bridget Moynahan's character is left alone at the end. She had so little to act with, she'll get that Big Part sometime, I tell you that. She's already great in The Recruit, as the love interest of Colin Farrel, definitely one to keep your eyes on.Hope to see an other movie of this great team, they understand the word ""chemistry""..My rating: 8,5 ..I guess I'm a sucker for romantic comedies :)",Serendipity
162,secretron,schmaltzy fun,7,13 October 2001,"There's not a thing about Serendipity that's as spontaneous nor as unpredictable as the movie's premise - two attached twentysomethings meet in a department store, have instant chemistry & rather than pursue the relationship any further, the female in the equation (Kate Beckinsale) decides to leave the possibility of reuniting to fate.
Why & how this happens is the premise of the entire film, and there's not a moment after this cute encounter that we don't see every just-missed reunion (and the inevitable conclusion) coming from miles & miles away.  Despite this, Serendipity is very entertaining, mainly due to the inspired casting. John Cusack is typically endearing as the male lead & Beckinsale, sporting her own British accent for once, is charming & believable as the object of his desire.  One would find it even more ridiculous that these two have been harping over each other for 10 years (count 'em), even despite the fact that both are coincidentally to be married to their respective beaus at around the same time, if not for the appeal of the actors portraying them.The supporting cast lends a lot to the film's likeability - especially the always stellar Jeremy Piven as Cusack's sometimes overly supportive best pal.  Molly Shannon, John Corbett & Eugene Levy also stand out in minor roles.Serendipity is schmaltzy fun - you know exactly where you're going on this ride, but it's still a worthy adventure.  7 out of 10.",Serendipity

I loved the locations and near misses in their relationship. I loved the supporting characters like Jeremy Piven and Eugene Levy. This was a movie where everything seemed to come together perfectly.Imagine my surprise when I saw it last night on television and some of my favorite memories turned out to be so contrived.

I rented the DVD just because I'm a big fan of Cusack (but starting to wonder if he has done anything worth watching since ""John Malkovich""). I find it irritating that both main characters go as far as planning their weddings with someone else, were ready to hurt their partner's feelings (money doesn't seem to be a problem either : hello, I'm sure getting married at the Astoria doesn't come cheap).  For Christ sake, they had 7 years to think about it, if you're really in love with someone, you don't wait that long.

Eugene Levy as the Bloomingdale's salesman and Molly Shannon as Sara's friend were outstanding, as was Jeremy Piven as Jonathan's best buddy. I thought the music used in the movie was perfect also.Serendipity is funny and touching, and is a movie that makes you think; what if I'd done this instead of that, or been there instead of here.",Serendipity
170,Walter_c,an excellent romantic film,10,4 March 2012,"Serendipity was the first and the best romance film I've seen. It is my belief that you can watch this movie every week, because of its light and magic atmosphere with the original soundtrack (featuring Alan Silvestri's great and incredibly nice theme ""Obituary"") which completes the picture. Shown as a quite romantic place (where the story happened), NYC on Xmas really enchants with its atmosphere and Central park. The story and the accidents in the film may seem to be unrealistic or too perfect for someone, Serendipty however is kind of a touching and charming movie anyway. You just have to cut notions like ""destiny', ""fate"" out of your mind because this is no more than the scenery for a movie about a love story and love in its romantic sense. The duet Cusack-Beckinsale looked very charming and naturally, even when their characters were acting in a some weird (and stupid in some sense) way. Eugene Levy and Jeremy Piven also injected the best comedic elements in the final mix. One of the movies' great merits is about heart-to-heart moments between characters, shown very gently and softly. Because of this merit the movie doesn't seem to be glossy or sugary. Serendipity doesn't pretend to be a multi-layered film with kinda new ideas (neither do most romantic films I reckon) but it fulfills the key purpose of giving the audience warmth and a bit of hope.",Serendipity
171,taylmw,A Delightful Feel-good flick,8,13 January 2002,"I actually saw this movie on a Qantas flight while crossing Australia.  As one of the last hopeless romantic guys on this Earth, I can safely recommend this as a great flick!Kate Beckinsale, whom many would remember from her much under-rated performance in ""Pearl Harbor"" (and, by the way, has the most gorgeous eyes!), plays Sarah in her chance meeting with John Cusack (another of my fave actors).This film has remarkable ""Sleepless in Seattle"" feelings about it, and while not one of the Top Ten Miramax films, still very much worth seeing.",Serendipity
172,spotdog19,Good movie to watch with your spouse / girlfriend,7,24 October 2010,"This isn't a great movie but it is a good movie. If you liked ""It Could Happen to You,"" ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" or ""You've Got Mail"" you will probably like this movie.The ending is very predictable and the plot is one that has been done a hundred times. Regardless, the cast is good with notables such as John Cusak (If you haven't seen Better Off Dead...GET IT!!), always worth watching Kate Beckinsale, and the stunning Briget Moynahan. John Cusak was made for this role and, as said, I'll watch Kate Beckinsale paint a house! Pop some corn and have your beverage of choice ready and enjoy this fun romantic comedy.",Serendipity
173,richardscd,A Pleasant Surprise,10,19 February 2004,"This movie was a wonderful little romantic comedy.  While it may not be When Harry Met Sally... it is still very entertaining, and is watchable more than once.  Cleverly done, and with a wonderful cast, this movie came out of nowhere and won its way into my personal movie lists.  Others may say that it is overdone or cliche, but these people do not understand the fel of the movie, which is comfortably tongue-in-cheek.  Watch this movie and enjoy!!!",Serendipity
174,darktowerofnuri,Fortunate Accident!,9,28 March 2005,"The first time I've seen this movie, I knew I'd add it to my ""classics"", and here it is. Kate Beckinsale shows her talent -finally- within the movie by blending right into the act of John Cusack. Since I'm in love with these kind of movie scripts, the movie got me in its clasp as I've heard Armstrong's deep voice in the beginning. As the movie starts, the movie's philosophy starts to reveals itself through a pair of black Kashmir gloves. The fact that love will find a way through it all is buzzing all around the movie and makes you feel warmer even though it's winter and snowing. The ice skating section and the ending section on the same ""floor"" are wondrous moments which any people would like to live - which makes the movie closer to the audience. The thought of someone ""right around the corner"" waiting for you is all around the movie and makes you feel like go out and find ""them"". A really cute story with a good sense of humor. Deserves my 9! I just LOVE watching it!",Serendipity
175,Jemelene,This was a great date movie!,10,5 October 2001,My husband and I enjoyed this movie on our night out! It was truly entertaining and enjoyable. We spent dinner thinking up alternative endings. It was sweet and moving. They could have left out the scenes of her sister and boyfriend or even cleaned them up a bit but that was the only foul part of the show!I plan on buying the video as soon as it comes out. This would make a great girls night out movie too but a must see with your spouse!,Serendipity

Never over-played by either made the movie. You would love to see another movie starring this pair, like the Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan films. The beauty of Kate Beckinsale brings tears to your eyes.

177,msc23,"typical, but not bad",6,23 April 2002,"When I rented the DVD, I was just looking for something lighthearted.  I think Serendipity fit the bill.  It's a decent story that gives the characters a purpose and a destiny.  Sure, the plot is not too original and you'll immediately notice similarities to Next Stop Wonderland and When Harry Met Sally, but it leaves you with a good mood.  No tear jerking or knee-slapping here, just a light romantic comedy... too bad I watched it alone, it's a date movie.",Serendipity
178,lloyd dobler,uh-oh it's magic.,10,13 October 2001,"I was a bit skeptical going into it because i wanted to love it so much but i just heard Ebert trash the hell of it and him and i usually get along. (Not that we know each other but you know what i mean.) But i pushed his comments aside and went into the film with an open mind and i left with it overflowing. The movie is about fate, coincidences and 'are you really supposed to be with the one you're with?' What could have been a very cheesy story was told with grace and raw human emotion. It was beautiful. I laughed, i cried, i sat on the edge of my seat and by god i was never bored. That in itself is a big deal. Beckinsale and Cusack should get married and adopt me. i definitely recommend it if you're married, single, in love, out of love, looking for love, whatever you are i hope you will at least see 1/10th of what i saw and go home happy. Officially my 2nd favorite Cusack movie.. i think you know my first. take care comb your hair.",Serendipity
179,smilesandmusic,Quite annoying,5,7 May 2020,"The scenes with Cusack and Beckinsale together work fine. It's cute and that's what you expect when starting to watch a romantic comedy, obviously. However, I think that it's very unrealistic and that no one should take their chances like Jon and Sara did. If you want something, you have to work for it, and even when it comes to love, you have to try hard. The series of events in which Jon and Sara are trying to find each other are just too annoying and unnecessary if you ask me.",Serendipity
180,banjogal,Love in the time of....,9,2 October 2001,"YoChampagne in a paper cup is still champagne.  I especially liked the bubbles in Serendipity. Its a date with destiny.  The film is a celebration of what life can bring if you let it.  It is not the usual sarcastic comedy or love wins over tremendous odds film that we have come to expect when we go to the movies.  Its about two people meeting by chance, at one of the most unromantic moments of the year. Both are Christmas shopping in a huge department store a few days before the big event.  Both are stressed.  Both are in a hurry.  Both want the same pair of black cashmere gloves.  Both stop for a moment and recognize something intangible in that moment. Cusack's character (Jonathan Trager, a golf producer for ESPN) the more practical and older of the two takes the lead.  Beckingsale's character (Sara Thomas) throws caution to the wind and follows for a delightful evening of flirting with fate.  Both lead actors are excellent in their roles.  The supporting cast is wonderful, except for Trager's fiancé, Hally, who looks uncomfortable with him (no wonder he gives up on her.)What I found very interesting was how the two main characters eventually switch beliefs with Trager seeing signs that it was not meant to be and Thomas giving into practicality.  Their friends also change with them borrowing their fears, hopes, and dreams. Jeremy Piven is excellent in his scenes with Cusack.  There are quite a few funny scenes and a number of feel good ones, some light tension and a wonderful culmination.  Please don't forget this is a modern faerie tale.The important thing is this film left me feeling good, at a time when I really needed to feel good, about life and love and people in general.  The entire cast and crew should be proud of the fact that they are delivering a message of love and life and what it can be, if we just believe.It's not perfect but I'd go again just for the serendipitous feeling... ...and they lived happily ever after.Denise",Serendipity
181,bpatters,"""My Favorite Movie Of All Time""",10,18 December 2002,"How can I put this movie into words? Okay, well let me start out from the beginning. I loved happy, romantic comedies for a long time. A Family member and I were on vacation and happen to go see ""A.I.""-(Great Movie As Well)- I had already seen it, but what I hadn't seen the first time was the trailer of ""Serendipity"". When with my relative, the second time, I did! I told myself I had to see it.2 Months or so went by and I am setting on my bed, eating dinner, and I almost, literally, drop my plate. There it was, on TV, ""Serendipity"" Sneak Preview- Saturday Night. So, a friend and I went to see the preview, and I loved it-(even though I missed a really good part, when I went to the bathroom- laugh) So, I sat there, watching an awesome cast tell this amazing story, of love, fate, & destiny. The first thing that popped in my head was ""Christmas In Manhattan"". First of all, I love Christmas movies, and this one hit the spot. Now, you're probably wondering what I'm talking about when saying ""Christmas In Manhattan"". Well, there is this CD, produced by David Huntsinger, called the exact same name. I got it back in 1997, for like $4 at Wal-Mart, the Christmas music on it was so excellent, and peaceful, that you felt you were actually in New York! So, since ""Serendipity"" is about ""Christmas In Manhattan"" I was thrilled, and it was a wonderful, elegent film. So good, that I still actually have my ticket from the sneak preview. It was Saturday, September 29, 2001, it was a night to remember.I saw it once more on the big screen, then it finally came to video April 9, 2002. Sadly, I decided to save my money for other DVD's. Boy, did I make the wrong decision. So, 3 months ago I used a Wal-Mart gift card someone had gotton me, and bought ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" Soundtrack, and ""Serendipity"" DVD! Since then I have watched it over 22 times, not to mention all the times I already watched it, because right after it came out I kept on renting it! Now, I also own the soundtrack, which I can't stop listening too.Wow, what a movie! A great cast, plot, and soundtrack. I can honestly say that ""Serendipity"" has got me through rouge times, and through life since it entered my life back in 2001! I always turn to it, and it always entertains me. The lovely music from such artists as Shawn Colvin, Louis Armstrong, Wood, and so many more make you cry tears of joy, and John Cusake & Kate Beckinsale along with the whole cast make you cheer for more! And little things like ""Christmas In Manhattan"" for me make it even better. Do not think for one minute doubting ""Serendipity"".I Have entered it into my family as well. I've also got my 2 stepsisters, who are 4 & 8 years-old hooked on it as well. So as you can see it's a great movie for all ages! ""Serendipity"" will lead you to a poweful faith in what the ancients used to call ""fatum""- what we currently refer to as destiny!",Serendipity

As far as I am concerned, I made a reputation here as a ruthless reviewer, but there are times that movie really, I mean REALLY, knock you down. Like this one. And there are times that movie is so critically acclaimed of it's greatness, and then you watch it and ask yourself: "" What the hell did the critics thought when they rate movie with such a high score???""... Not this one.I remember that I watched this movie on TV a couple of years ago and I was quite excited about it, nice heart-warming story, good acting, the movie had something I like to call ""it"" that made me watch it from beginning till the end.Let me see... It doesn't matter that one of my favorite actors are Cusack, this is a great way to spend one and a half hour thinking that the destiny unites us all, thinking how love always find the way, all this list of bull...list of meaningless stuffs. But when this package is delivered with good acting, good storyline and decent characters, then it really has some meaning.After all this teen movies, (I love you, you love me, we break up, we got back together), this one finally have some meaning (exluding the fate stuff, but thats what makes this movie interesting). It will not make you cry, it will not turn your world around, but it will get to you. You will feel... relief. Relief of all the things that aren't right that supposed to be right, and maybe for a second or minute, you will feel that love is beyond everything, as it supposed to be in this cruel world.

185,Psychic_htz,Pap,2,5 June 2003,"Call me a man, but I've never in my life enjoyed a romantic comedy.  OK, actually that's not entirely true.  As Good As It Gets, Groundhog Day and LA Story are all very good, and funny movies.  The difference with Serendipity is that it's not.  Occasionally it is amusing - but never funny.  It concentrates more on the romance which, like Titanic, made me want to be violently ill.The plot is predictably predictable.  A total no brainer in a fantasy world without even any aliens or explosions.  On the plus side it's well enough made, and well enough acted.  But I say 'so what?'.I saw this movie with a new girlfriend.  I thought it would be a good idea to see something 'feelgood' and 'warm'.  I thought it would be good to compromise my personal taste in movies for the greater good of the relationship.  Wrong.  I never forgave her for dragging me to this tripe. We broke up 2 weeks later.Not for the jaded male. 2/10",Serendipity

After wandering about in my hometown I ended up in a DVDstore where one of my friends work. Being a huge Kate Beckinsale-fan, i bought Serendipity for 3,50 and watched it at home. The main theme of this movie is 'destiny' and, next to making you drool it makes you think: What if? Dozens of what-ifs.Apart from my own person experience, I KNOW everybody has his/her personal what-if moment. What if i wasn't here 3 years ago but there, what has destiny made for me? (also: What if the movie i intended to buy wasn't sold out? Would i have seen Serendipity on another occasion?) Not only the story is great, also Cusack, Beckinsale and Shannon (who's great in 'Never been kissed') act extremely well and yet so normal and down to earth.Another great Beckinsale movie",Serendipity
187,edmass,Very enjoyable comedy.,8,3 March 2004,"Fine performances and great attention to plot details and settings make up for a rather fanciful plot. Surely keeping the emotional connection between the two leads over such a long time would have been a lot more plausible if there had been a little intimacy during their first night. Indeed, a giggly quickie with politely embarrassed apologies afterward would have fit the plot just fine.  Also, there didn't seem to have been a lot of thought put into the search for Sara's name and address.   And the writers really could have worked harder to find a plot twist or two at the end to justify the way things came out. But the film moved along nicely and it was really fun to watch an engaging romp put together with intelligent direction.",Serendipity
188,TeeBut,Enjoyable,7,6 February 2002,"After getting past the seemingly bizarre circumstances that the remainder of this film leads into, Serendipity is actually quite enjoyable.

Enjoy!",Serendipity
189,Hound-2,"Delightful, refreshing",9,1 October 2001,"Charming, intelligent romantic comedy which makes a good deal of progress towards bringing back the ""comedy"" in this genre. Intelligently acted by all involved--Cusack is his usual likeable self, and Beckinsale is dazzling. Molly Shannon and Eugene Levy in particular shine as supporting players. John de Boorman's cinematography is superb, Marc Klein's script is witty, and Peter Chelsom's direction holds the whole thing together. The producers made the extremely wise decision to shoot all exteriors in New York City itself (although rumor has it the interiors were shot in Toronto.) My only complaints would be that the film seemed to have been edited down somewhat--another ten-fifteen minutes wouldn't have hurt--and the soundtrack was somewhat conventional. Still, well worth seeing--a film with such a positive, romantic view of New York has a chance to do very well in light of recent events. Expect good things.",Serendipity

Sad to say, but this film will either be loved or hated, so of like most Christian books.I loved it, not because I'm an incurable romantic to begin with, but rather because somewhere in my heart, there lies the seeds for that romanticism, needing only the water of cinema to make them flower.",Serendipity
193,rosegirl,Delightful and enchanting...even my husband loved this one,10,4 January 2002,"...and he usually avoids romantic comedies like the plague. ;-) He walked out of the theater and gave me a little half-smile and said, ""I really enjoyed that!"" Translation? This movie is not just for women. It is for anyone who has an ounce of romance in their soul, an ounce of hope that the right thing does happen sometimes, a smidgen of belief in fate.I am one of John Cusack's most devoted fans and knew that I had to devour this movie the second it came out.I got dreamily lost in this beautiful story. Yes, it's predictable and a tad frustrating with all the near-miss meetings between Sara and Jonathan, however this did not take any of the magic away for me.I knew what was going to happen, but reveled in it, and was so anxious and swept up in the story that I almost wanted the resolution to be stretched out further...I cried at least three times during this one...not out of sadness, but sheer joy and sentimentality.SPOILERS FOLLOW!!!! DO NOT READ ON IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW DETAILS!!!
One of my favorite scenes is when Hallie gives Jonathan the book as the wedding present, and then an almost-speechless, teary-eyed Jonathan shows the book to his best friend Dean. At that moment, they knew that Jonathan would find Sara.The ending was absolutely breathtaking. The snow, the glove, the slow tear from Jonathan's eye when he sees the vision of Sara, standing in the flesh, finally, before him. Oh man, I wanted to LIVE in that scene!
If you are a Cusack fan, this is a MUST SEE. Wait...if you are a human being, this is a MUST SEE.Don't get nitpicky on this one, who really cares about predictability. When it works, it works. We know a great love story when we see one, and it's this kind of love-conquers-all sentiment that is the best kind of dream to believe in. So, go, watch the movie, and believe in Serendipity.You won't be sorry. Unless you're a hopeless cynic, in which case, this movie is not your biggest problem! :-)",Serendipity

With a great cast (Is it just me, or is Kate Beckinsale a great up-and-comer?), including John Cusack, Kate Beckinsale and Molly Shannon, this movie is highly entertaining.

196,dashing-samson,Too many coincidences,6,17 February 2009,This is a movie with lot of incidences happening in an unrealistic fashion. It reminds me of our Bollywood Romantic flicks which often have a number of coincidences. Anyways if you keep your 'left brain thinking' aside and just start enjoying the movie it'll appear a cute one. The couple Cusack-Becknisale have an amazing chemistry. The innocence of Cusack and the charm of Becknisale keeps you glued to the screen. She has faith in her fate and she believes that if Cusack and she are meant to be together then fate will reunite them. Cusack already attracted to her tries to find her but they don't meet until the fate turns their way. It takes a series of predictable events to reunite the couple and you reach home feeling good about it.,Serendipity

But the boredom! The story has about 3 good jokes (Old Spice, You Can't Be on this Side of the Counter and ... - I can't even remember what else!), all of which are in the trailer. The same goes for romantic moments. All the rest is a waste of time, as was my trip to see it. The only reason to stay until the end was my hope that it would not have the expected ending, and the two main characters would realise that it is better to cherish a great memory and fantasize about what could have been, than to gratuitously dump someone who you previously agreed to marry. If not stupid, that at least makes them inconsistent: fate does not rule their romance with one person, but it does with another. Yeah, right. Do not go see this movie.",Serendipity

203,ca_localgirl,"Predictable, drawn out, unlikely...",4,6 November 2001,"This is one of the movies where the trailer gives away the whole plot, and the movie reveals no unexpected events, twists or ideas.   The main message of this movie is cute, heartwarming and inspiring, but its method of delivering this is way overdone.  The exact same situations and thoughts are repeatedly presented to you over and over again.  It seems long and drawn out, with the situations that were designed to create suspense being overly predictable, silly and annoying.I have only seen three John Cusak movies (this one, America's Sweethearts and High Fidelity), and I'm about to conclude that Cusak is a mediocre actor, at best.  His character, Jonathan Trager, is barely likeable in this movie.  He is insensitive and uncaring towards his current girlfriend, he comes off as creepy and desperate when he first meets his mystery lady played by Kate Beckinsale. This was probably one of Molly Shannon's better performances, however that's not saying much...If you've seen the trailer, you've already seen all the originality the movie has to offer.",Serendipity
204,carlosunoiii,The feeling I got was like a being through a romantic journey.,8,22 November 2001,"Romance is definitely one of the essentials of life that makes living exciting and exhilarating with every twists and turns of events from moments to moments. The movie reminded of something my father told me when I was a young kid ""Can you imagine how boring life would have been if you knew to the most minute detail what would happen to your life from this moment on up to the time you pass away."" It may be comparable to a fairy tale but in a more realistic sense and in the same token also brings into light the much argued and debated subject of predestination. The flow of events in the movie and how the actors and actresses portrayed their roles makes you wanting for more like the Chinese trick of boxes wherein it is not what you may find inside every box you open but the gamut of emotions experienced with every box opened. In summing up, I would say that ""Serendipity"" is a fairy tale and a romantic suspense thriller wrapped up in one.",Serendipity

I saw this last night at a advance screening which was sold out. The audience loved the movie. In fact there's a scene with a five dollar bill that had one audience member yelling out,""Turn it over."" The word of mouth  from these advance screenings will help push this movie to near the top of the box office. Since it opens aganist 'Training Day' it may come in second but don't bet against a first place showing. Cusack is once again great. His everyman approach to acting is wonderful. The last scene with just the one tear running from the corner of his right eye is great under acting but conveys the strong emotional reaction the end of the movie calls for from him.    Finally is there anyone better then Eugene Levy or Jeremy Piven for giving strong supporting performances that raise a movie from 'B' to an 'A' level?

207,timotea,Light and charming,9,24 November 2001,"""Serendipity"" is a light and charming romantic comedy in the style of ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""The Family Man"", in the sense that they both recur to the issues of fate and the perennial ""what if"" to tell the story. The backbone of the cast, as adorable as Mr. Cusack and Ms. Beckinsale are, was Jeremy Pivan, in the role of Dustin.  He, along with Jason Lee (can't wait to see him in ""Vanilla Sky""), are the two best comedic ""sidekick"" actors of the last few years.  His timing and delivery saved the film at times when it might have lost the audience.",Serendipity

I didn't get a chance to use it yet, but i surely will use it on my date in the near future.I sometimes wonder why I have begun to start loving romantic comedies with a happy ending ( my friends call them as ""Chick movies"" or ""date movies""), I think some other movies in the same genre would be 1) A walk to remember 2) Only you 3) Wimbledon 4) Pride and Prejudice (2005) 6) Four weddings and a funeral 7) Notting Hill 8) Sweet November 9) Sweet home Alabama 10) The lake houseAlthough some of these movies may have a difficult ending, they most certainly are romantic date movies ( this is soo weird, I used to hate romantic movies that made you cry but after watching some of the above mentioned films, I have begun to enjoy the crying with the movie o_O )If anyone comes across a more full list of similar kind of movie, please doo post a comment or email me",Serendipity
209,eric_hanson,"What a sleeper, did they even try to make a good movie?",4,13 February 2003,"Wow, I can't believe people consider this a 'good' movie. Now, I have seen much worse, but there are much more romantic/funny comedies with John Cusack.This is a mediocre film at best. While the acting wasn't terrible, but not great, for a romantic comedy, there was little passion, little romance. There were many loose ends that don't show up or are not addressed. Unfortunately, the main characters do come off as complete cowards. They don't know themselves well enough to realize that they don't love the people they are engaged to. How do we know they aren't in love? By the utter lack of remorse both characters have for leaving their finances. I can think of few things more romantic than the continual escape from commitment that these two show.The movie doesn't even end with a wedding scene, more than likely both will get cold feet and drop each other like hot potatoes once a commitment is nearing. This movie is really about two people who can't commit to anything, unlike Cusack's previous characters, who were more than willing to make a deep commitment (Loyd in Say Anything, Martin in Grosse Pointe Blank, etc.).The greatest failure of this movie was the complete lack of any twists turns, or anything of interest. When the movie ended, I felt like they had failed to include a climax to the story, which basically fits the whole movie: boring. No suspense about whether the two will end up together, no joy when they do, no consequences to their actions.It is sad that people are so blind to the shoddiness of this movie, that they simply rebuke any criticism with 'Everyone is too Cynical!'. Criticism of this movie is not cynicism, simply unbiased examination. There are many other better romantic comedies, even ones with Grace Kelly, or Eva Marie Saint.If you think this movie is great, try these movies, you hearts will explode: The Princess Bride, Say Anything, Grosse Pointe Blank, High Fidelity, Keeping the Faith, Charade, Rear Window, North by Northwest, or There's Something About Mary (which is a good examination of idealized romance vs. today's society).",Serendipity
210,dhavaludani,Luck or fate or destiny,8,16 March 2005,"Claim to fame : One of the best new-age romantic movies ever made Luck favors the brave is the message that instantly comes to mind by the time the movie ends. The movie intends to send the explicit message that though many things seem to happen by accident, there is destiny involved and every individual is responsible for shaping his or her destiny in life.""Serendipity"" means good luck by accident which is exactly how Jonathan Trager (John Cusack) and Sara (the ravishing Kate Beckinsale) meet up while shopping for Christmas gifts in a departmental store in New York. They both select the same gift i.e. a glove which John subsequently gives up in return for a lovely blended coffee at Sara's favorite New York restaurant called ""Serendipity"". For a background, Jonathan, an ESPN producer in New York is soon to marry his girlfriend Haley while Sara, a student counselor in San Francisco is soon to tie the knot with her boyfriend who is a flute musician. Jonathan is one who lives by rationale in life and believes there is a reason behind everything in life and that one is in-charge of it. On the other hand Sara is a firm believer in fate and destiny and believes that one will always land up where one was supposed to be. They engage in numerous such games to see how fate holds up for them and the lift incident is almost poignant to a point.Sara finally leaves New York with her telephone number written on a book which she will sell to a bookstore and if she and John are meant to be together, then John will find this book and be able to call her. Similarly she gets John to write his number on a 5-dollar bill. She says that if the bill comes back to her she will know that they were meant to be together. What follows is one accident after another which convinces John that she is the girl for him and starts an expedition to search for her in a very methodical manner. In this place the story slowly moves around to the point telling us that if we want something we have to fight for it. We cannot expect luck to give it to us. We see that even Sara returns to New York to search for her man, a woman well changed to make her own luck. At the end John has run out of ideas but feels vindicated.Though one might become overly pessimistic regarding the number of favorable accidents that happen in the movie, the beauty of this movie lies in its subtlety. The use of the gloves to indicate both separation and hope is truly brilliant. The subsequent depiction of the gloves throughout the movie allows the viewers to relate very closely with the protagonists. Characters in this movie have been developed with care and depth; whether they are John and Sara's friends or the salesman at the departmental store. The scenes at the Central Park skating rink are not only moving but very beautiful as well as John lies there in hope of finding his true love in life. And last but not the least, the music by Alan Silvestri is of the highest quality and adds a definitive emotional appeal to this already beautiful movie.",Serendipity

Harmless and reasonably charming, with an excellent cast battling a mostly non-funny, non-inventive script.  (And I wish Molly Shannon had had more to do.) Romantic comedies generally have no surprises at the end:  girl gets boy (and vice versa).  To make them interesting, they need sparkling dialog and surprising events along the way.

It was one of the best supporting acting jobs in a long time and was much better than Ian McKellan and Ethan Hawke, who were both nominated for Oscars, even though I enjoyed their performances.  I didn't see the others for comparison.  When he is done, you want go over to your best friend, smack him in the head, and ask him why he's so lame.  He just exudes passion.Then there is John Cusack's subtle but effective performance.  His built up haggardness during the chase is so good, you hardly notice it.  By the time he has received the book and is in the cab with Piven, his anxiety and distress are absolutely palpable.And Kate Beckinsdale really enraptures you.  The movie doesn't work without her because she is that adorable that you could see someone chasing her for years.  That's not easy.  We've all seen stars screw that up in other Romantic Comedies.  Had Julia Roberts not half assed her way thru Notting Hill, it would have been even better.  It's too bad for Kate, I think had it not for Amelie's release in the same timeframe in the US, she may have been heralded as this year's new ingenue.Plot is fun, but does require some dispending of disbelief, but who goes to a RC for pure reality.

It is up to you, whether to believe it or not. If you don't then it will make no difference in your life. If you do then it will make you feel and appreciate the little, seemingly unimportant things in life and how important they can suddenly become. It states some important things so simply that it can't be made easier to understand. The part between Josh Cusack and his friend on the plane at the end is an example. It's a very clean-made movie with proper maturity of treatment. These things happen in everybody's life; this story just qualified to be made into a movie. I think everybody did a great job here.

219,ehjoe,A typical Hollywood love fantasy,5,20 May 2007,"OK--I admit I enjoyed this movie a good bit. I like John Cusack, and Kate Beckinsale is beautiful, for sure. The music is good, especially the two songs used in the final scene. The store clerk part, played by the guy who's also the dad in American Pie, is hilarious. The Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon best friend parts are good, and the ""obit"" written by Piven's character for Cusack's character borders on profound.BUT--here's my beef with the movie: perhaps part of the reason why so many marriages fail these days is that we have been seduced by the typical Hollywood romantic fantasy (of which this film is a textbook case), which can be summarized like this: all you need to be happy in love is to find that ONE PERSON meant for you. The trick is finding that person, and once you do, you've got it made. There's nothing else to do.Get real, people. There is a crucial difference between being in love with the IDEA of a person (nurtured by both lead characters for seven years in this movie, after they spend a few hours together) and living out a committed relationship, day in and day out, for a lifetime together. You need a whole lot more than the sentimental love portrayed here to make a relationship last ""until death parts you."" Real relationships have to get by on commitment to stick with it, and not much else, at least from time to time. True love is not created from an evening together and some sort of sense of ""destiny;"" it is built a day at a time, a year at a time.I know, some will tell me to lighten up. I don't reject ""romance"" completely. But let me try a paradox on you: You can create a lasting relationship with any number of people. There is no such thing as that ""one right person;"" the belief in that fantasy probably leads many a person to shy away from the hard work that it takes to build a lasting love relationship. Once it gets a little difficult, one is tempted to say, ""I must not have made the right choice. I have to keep looking."" But here's the paradox part: through sticking it out with your partner through thick and thin, etc., eventually you may come to believe that indeed, this was the right person for you. Maybe ""destiny"" plays a role, but ""destiny"" (or ""God,"" or whatever you want to call it) needs the cooperation of the two people involved over the long haul.So let's not get too enamored of this story as though it offers some deep ""truth"" about love. I'd much rather see a movie that grapples with the hard work of a lifelong commitment. Maybe there are some, but that would be quite difficult to do in two hours on the screen. The problem is that most of us don't want such realism in our movies; we crave the fantasy.",Serendipity

What lifts Serendipity a little above the run-of-the-mill chick flick, however, is director Peter Chelsom's simple but artful blend of good acting, good chemistry among the leads, dressed with Marc Klein's witty script. John Cusack's jaded sports writer and Kate Beckinsale's new-age trainee psychiatrist make a good-looking and interesting match that would have any audience rooting for them, but no less pleasant to witness is the easy camaraderie between Cusack and real-life buddy, Jeremy Piven, who gets some of the best lines in the film.

And, John, if you are out there and ever read this, my god do I love you. Back on track....Now, when I'm talking about the believability of the movie I'm not just talking about the reality that such coincidences may occur, so repetitiously, I am speaking more about the believability when it comes to the feelings the characters have for each other. You can feel it. I've actually felt the longing for someone in the period of 10-15 years and not knowing if I was ever to find them. My story doesn't come close to the drama these two had, or the romance, but my god if it doesn't make for a beautiful movie and wishful thinking. You know a ""chick flick"" as some call it is good when you're a woman who has a masculine husband that can sit with her and his male best friend and watch it, while making comments that it was actually a very well-played-out love story.

Piven and Cusack MAKE the film and are totally believable as life-long best friends who would do anything for each other. Kate Beckinsale is also good as the lost love interest to Cusack.

Unrealistic, sure but great nonetheless.***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***Enter Serendipity.

Obsessed with fate, she makes no real decisions on her own and, in the end, the only thing that saves her from being a lonely mess is the fact that Jonathan is just as silly.Summary: Serendipity is a silly movie that even the 12 year olds sitting behind us in the theater weren't moved by.

The storyline all but confirms that no two people will ever find their ""soul mates""  without an incredible amount of luck.  It has nothing to do with what a good person you are, but your ability to be overdramatic about every single detail in your life.  The number of times fate had to intervene is statistically phenomenal.  What is romantic about  having your autonomy completely stripped from you?

Being a cynic and something of a curmudgeon, I need an actress who can charm me into accepting the silliness of movies like this. Or at least make me forgive is deficiencies.A good example of an actress doing this is Drew Barrymore in 'Never Been Kissed.' That movie is daft in concept, bereft of wit and imagination and shot in a manner that doesn't contain a single original idea. But Drew plays her part with such earnestness and old-fashioned sweetness that, for me, it sort of worked. I felt stupid and manipulated but I can't deny I quietly cheered when Michael Vartan turned up at the end.For this movie to work, Kate Beckindale had to do something similar - work a certain magic, be impossibly lovely and trick me into accepting the movie on its own idiotic terms. But she doesn't. She may have a lovely accent and look pretty in the snow, but there's nothing engaging about her performance. Indeed, she even fails to make this character likable. I'm sure Sara was supposed to have kooky charm but she comes across as childish, impetuous and annoying.I suppose some of this could - and indeed should - be blamed on poor writing, but the main problem is that this actress just lacks that je ne sais quoi. For all the film's faults - and there are many, ranging from the dull direction to Cusack's phoned in performance - I suspect a more charming actress could have held it together.

While Serendipity is by no means as memorable as Sleepless..., it does provide quality entertainment and does deter you from ever marrying, just incase your special little lady is not 'the one'!There is no doubting that Rom-Com's are not everyones cup of tea.  But for those who like their films sweet, Serentipity delivers.  Cusack.. whose fame in the indie-comedy genre has allowed him great critical success, goes mainstream for the second time in the year.  The first of those products, America's Sweethearts was well promoted and very entertaining(7/10).  But, Serendipity allows Cusack the ability to look better at being a hopeless romantic than in, say, High Fidelity(still undecided/10).
Beckinsale is gorgeous, which is a good start... is she meg ryan? no...how could anyone compare?! but she does put in a good perfomance, manages to look cute when she smiles and best of all comes from the good old UK!I like Cusack... there's no doubting the guys actor and 'star' quality and I like Beckinsale... She's sweet and talented... perfect for the Sandra Bullock mold of actress.  But... He is no Hanks and She is no Meg... so it is not the great Sleepless.

I don't think you can compare it to Say Anything and When Harry Met Sally. Just my opinion.Anyway, I could watch this film every day. I'm not sure why, but it just works for me. I must say this film, while totally different, ranks up there with Before Sunrise and Before Sunset. I know that Serendipity isn't as serious, but I really care about these two. As much as I do about Jesse and Celine. Kate and John are great in the short time they spend in the film together.Anyway, I love this film, and I hate the word retard since I am a disabled individual.",Serendipity

I love this movie for just that reason for believing in happenstance and fate that we can come together if we were meant to be. It's a beautiful coincidence and one that leaves its mark no matter how long you live. That's what its all about. The little things that make this world so wonderful and livable. This is one of those. Turns out for Cusack and Bekinsale it turned out to be a incident that changes their lives... :)I vote 8 mostly because I think the movie is sweet romantic comedy and appeals to the good in all of us and besides they make a hell of a cute couple.",Serendipity
241,denireguerrero,A Beautiful Love Story,10,30 November 2015,"In this romantic love story it tells the tale of how two ordinary people meet while Christmas shopping and give the universe a sign of one another in order to find out if they are meant for each other. Years later they both get the other person's sign and know their love was meant to be. Before the couple gets together years later, they were both about to get married to someone else. I guess everyone has someone they're meant to end up with. The name's of the two people are Jonathan and Kate, Kate describes Serendipity as ""a fortunate accident"". Which describes the movie perfectly because them meeting was supposed to happen and usually accidents aren't good, but in this movie it was a good thing that they did meet. The way that the universe kept sending them signals of each other before they met again was interesting. Both of them almost gave up because they didn't know where else to find each other. They then met again at the Ice Rink where they went after meeting and were together for a long time. This movie is a great movie to watch at any time, but better during around the holidays because it's around winter season in the movie. I love the concept of how fate can bring any two people closer than they thought.",Serendipity

I can almost guarantee it because all the while I'm on the edge of my seat. I enjoy it every time even though I've watched it many times.

243,doubledenholm,Saccharine Serendipity,2,28 April 2020,"For full disclosure, I as a young man am in no way the target demographic for Serendipity, but after watching it I felt compelled to scribble my thoughts down.I did not like anything about this movie, except maybe seeing a pre-entourage Jeremy Piven mediocrely try his hand playing John Cusack's sensitive best friend.This movie is chock-full of on the nose metaphors, pseudo-philosophical dialogue that in no way resembles how real humans talk, and poorly drawn characters that in turn drew sloppy performances from a cast of actors who are (mostly) capable of better.The great tragedy is that there is nothing redeemable about this movie. I didn't expect much going in, but boy was I surprised that there was nothing to like about this movie except for some rather large sequences of unintended comedy.Even the legendary Eugene Levy is given nothing to work with, and turns in a completely unfunny performance in what is clearly written to be a comedic cameo.John Corbett's turn as 'Lars Hammond' a world-famous rock-star clarinetist, is one of the most unintentionally hilarious characters I've seen. His live performance mid-way through the movie must have served to inspire Anchorman's iconic jazz flute scene. Right?My biggest bugbear with Serendipity is just how detestable and utterly selfish the lead characters are. Both lead their respective fiancées on for YEARS while pining for one another; with the way Cusack treats his pre-existing relationship is shocking to say the least.This film is worth watching as a case study for how to write the most unlikeable and unknowingly narcissistic leads possible.",Serendipity

Years later, Jonathan and Sarah are to be married----not to each other, but fate and some crazy antics bring them back to face each other again in the place where they spent their first magical evening.  A beautiful movie--full of John Cusack's timeless, ""real-man"" wit, with classic sidekick, Jeremy Piven; and Kate Beckinsdale's grace is offset by her movie best friend played by the hilarious Molly Shannon.  Funny, fast-paced and romantic.  Great date movie or perfect to rekindle loves-once-had.  Watch and enjoy.",Serendipity

246,sierra80,Great Movie!,10,6 October 2001,I saw this movie yesterday and felt so great about the world afterwards. Sometimes you need movies that can do that to you. Serendipity has an old story but it somehow seems new. This movie could have been so dull and the chemistry between John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale could have lit it up. So the acting is great and so is the story--Go see it! This is definitely one of my new favorites.,Serendipity
247,goodlookingbutt,Great movie!,10,29 September 2001,"I saw Serendipity in a Sneak Preview Screening.  I found it to be entertaining and charming...partly because there was good on-screen chemistry between John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale.  Molly Shannon was terrific as usual.  I also liked it because the name was so catchy...just say it over and over again ""Serendipity"", ""Serendipity"" and it'll amuse you. Although I did think that the movie was a little short.  I  hoped for it to be just a bit longer...but nonetheless it was still very good.  Probably the only minus of this film would be to not see it...that and I suggest going with a significant loved one, because after the film it makes you think about destiny, fate and all those other things.  If you didn't believe in fate before, it'll make you think twice about it.  Who knows...it may have been my destiny to write this review so that someone will e-mail me with the exact same feelings.  Neh.  So in conclusion, watch it.  It's a great date movie.  Kate Beckinsale rocks in it!  John Cusack is in his usual charming mode.  It's not an Academy Award Winning Film, but it's worth the $6-$8 pay.",Serendipity
248,ToxicEnema,Perfectly Acceptable Date Movie.,7,6 October 2001,"If you like John Cusack, you will love this movie. For those of you who don't like John Cusack, watch it and learn how he can take run of the mill material and make it better.Cusack's character is, in part, an extension of his High Fidelity character.... if he were successful and liked books. So, although he doesn't chart new waters here playing a romantic fool ... he glides through this movie and makes it work due to his charm. Which is nicely offset by Kate Beckinsale who plays a demure British girl with a few quirks. There are definitely better picks to play the female lead, but Beckinsale does leave an impression.Boy meets Girl, boy loses girl, boy regains girl. The movie is formulatic, no doubt, but it executes the formula very well. Also, the movie will throw you a few curves because it plays around with the formula a bit. As with any date movie, the secondary leads are essential. Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon do not disappoint. Most of the comedy bits are given to them, and they do very well. Eugene Levy plays the role of an overzealous sales clerk.
The backdrop is New York, and the movie doesn't let you forget it. They should use this movie as a travel brochure. The scenes and backdrops are gorgeous (reminscint of Home Alone, and fitting for the dewey-eyed romantic storyline that is being played out.When formula works you get this. When formula goes bad ... you get 'Sweet November'. There IS a difference.",Serendipity

I often feel warm and fuzzy inside after watching romantic comedies... from nausea!  Serendipity was just plain awful.  A couple meets and falls for each other, but decides to let their romantic future fall into fates hands. This is cowardly act #1 in a series of many cowardly acts played out by the 2 stars. Neither had the courage or emotional stability to act immediately on their feelings.  Instead they separate and eventually get engaged to other very commited people, but can't seem to commit to them either (Cowardly act #2).  what were they thinking getting engaged to begin with? They end up ""taking time off"" and searching for each other and after some lame tease scenes they ditch their fiances (cowardly act #3) and find each other. One thing is certain, these 2 flakey cowards deserve each other. I imagine the sequel would have the cowardly couple, splitting up and seeking out their ex-fiances who dump then on their cowardly butts. That would be a a real fitting end to this romantic comedy nightmare.",Serendipity

254,mw8421,"Great cast, but what about the script.... or the premise?",2,19 September 2010,"I was interested to watch this movie as all the actors are great, and to be honest, deep down I feel a sense of cheer from Romcoms. I knew a bit about the set-up before watching it, which sounded particularly awful and I was intrigued to see how they would manage to turn into something warm-some.A guy and girl meet and strike it off really well, spend a great evening together but then decide to leave it to fate to see if they will meet again (well she decides this and he has to go along with it). Obviously fate doesn't work out then, so we fast forward a couple of years and see how fate swings in their favour this time round. Unfortunately they are both in relationships now, on the verge of getting married, but still deep down harbour feelings from the memory of each other and so go in search.The casting was great, the 2 leads had really nice chemistry, and the filming and editing was well done. But I just couldn't get beyond the story and script. The story is played pretty straight, so in order to add some zing the writers inserted a number of utterly ridiculous and out of place gags or slapstick. Seriously when I watch films like this I'm always quite prepared to detach my brainstem for a good belly laugh but I just couldn't manage it this time. Also the whole idea of them about to get married to other people and then running off to look for each other just felt quite sad. By the end of film, when the star struck lovers had finally dumped their respective lovers (one, just before their wedding) and got together, I needed a really good scrub, as I felt plain grimy and morally corrupted.I would really like to know what the premiere was like and how people responded. Although sadly judging by a lot of the feedback on this site, they probably responded well.",Serendipity
255,dominic-shields,Not my bag but I liked it,7,31 December 2004,"These kinds of films generally don't do it for me but the plot synopsis made me watch it to see whether it would have any interesting twists. It would have been interesting to see what a director like the late Krystof Kieslowski would have done with the basic material as coincidences, fate and destiny were very much his thing. Chemistry between the leading actors is an over-hyped thing but in this film even though they aren't actually in shot together for all that long, you get the impression that they really liked each other. Previously I've thought Kate Beckinsale a very beautiful woman rather than an actress but in this film she is both, helped by not having to do a bad imitation of an American accent, why does any director ask anyone to do that ? As Morrissey observes - America is not the World.",Serendipity
256,threepete,Commitment? Who needs commitment?,4,28 July 2005,"First, let me say I'm a fan of both John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale. However, the premise of this movie really bothers me. Supposedly, it's o.k. to dump a person you've made a commitment to (and on the wedding altar no less) to chase after someone you spent a few blissful hours with several years ago. That neither Jonathan nor Sara seemed even remotely concerned for the feelings of their respective fiancés' was appalling. Then to underscore this callousness even further, Jonathan's best friend considers him to be some kind of hero for chasing after his dreams. Remarkable! Once, it would be noble if during one of these ""light"" Hollywood romantic comedies, the hero and the heroine would sacrifice their wants, needs and desires to stand by an earlier commitment. Is it any wonder middle America has problems with Hollywood?",Serendipity

But the reason that I am, because in general he plays very multi-layered characters who refuse to fit into the standard hollywood mold (one need look no further than Lloyd Dobler or Rob Gordon).  These are quirky and unpredictable characters that the audience comes to know and love.Jonathan Traegar is no such character.  The audience has no idea who he is or why he is behaving like he is.  Nothing is developed between the two main characters.  The sum total of their conversation on their ""magical night"" revolved around belief in fate.  Are we supposed to believe from this shaky foundation and four years of neurotic incubation that these two are soul mates?To carry this somewhat far-fetched premise, there must be a very powerful connection to warrant such strong feelings years later, and I just didn't see it.  I was left wondering why they even liked each other.  But I guess that doesn't matter as long as you wrap up the story in a nice little bow before the credits role.C'mon all I want is a little character development and a few less ridiculous coincidences.",Serendipity

268,clr-5,Breathtakingly vacuous,1,13 March 2002,"I went to this with the full expectation that I was going to see a chick flick, and had come to terms with that by the time it started.
This, however, is not a chick flick. This is a ""romance"" film about two individuals who, whilst both in perfectly-good-but-not-quite-perfect relationships with other people, take a fancy to a random stranger they meet in a department store one evening and so spend the rest of the night flirting outrageously like a cheap tart with them.This done, off they both go to continue their extant relationships. Unfortunately, instead of realising that they could do better and bringing the relationships to a neat end, they only decide to make a run for it on the eves of their coincident weddings. How serendipitous.We then have the pleasure of watching them each drag their best friends (one of whom's marriage is destroyed in the process) across the planet in order to try and find their once-potential philanderer, whilst their nice bride/groom stands rather forlornly alone at the altar. As any plot line following the jilted spouses is abandoned at this point, I am surmising that they were stood up. Perhaps they died. Who cares.Man finds girl, some snow falls, some kissing ensues and our happy couple realise that the forty-five minutes they spent together in a restaurant six months ago are more than enough to base their everlasting happiness on. Audience feel warm and fuzzy inside. Speaking for myself, I was certainlyclose to tears.The idea that this film could be billed as a romantic comedy is quite extraordinary. Certainly, the leading characters appear to share the moral outlook of a badger on heat and in that respect I'm very glad they managed to find a like-minded mate. Every other character featured in the film is quite laughably two-dimensional and the only deliberately comedic fragment I managed to spot was a quite nicely done best man's speech - made at the weddding subsequently destroyed by our lovably lust-fuelled hero and heroine.I am secretly hoping that the joke is on me, and Mr. Chelsom is treating us to a wonderfully dark satire on morals and romance in modern times.

Imagine if you were, to meet the perfect person, completely out of the blue just to have her/him slip away.. Then years later, the impression of that person remained in you, although the memory itself almost faded. And yet, a little bit of destiny and charm bring this story full circle.The film to me is magical, not only cause it's set in winter time, but also because it makes you believe and hope that real connection between two strangers can occur, and subsequently can happen to you.All we have to do is be open to it and life/universe/destiny will sooner or later give us an opportunity to experience it. It's up to us to seize the chance.John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale are perfect in their roles.

You should watch this movie with a friend rather than a lover, that way you can agree to leave the theatre/TV/DVD after 20 minutes, without falling out.

Fortunately for me, one of them left for Australia days before and the other had to work.  The tickets were passed on to me by random luck.In a similar fashion, Sara (Kate Beckinsdale) and Jonathan(John Cusack), find their paths cross by chance one fatefull night at Bloomingdales in New York.  They become entranced by one another in a way that is believable to us the audience, and spend most of the night together.

Eventually, after many attempts of leaving one another with fate intervening they finally lose each other hoping someday they will meet again.The rest of the movie has them go back to their current relationships, then a few years later try desperately to seek one another out.  Jonathan is days away from his marriage, while sara has just become engaged.  Jonathan, with the aid of his best man (Jeremy Piven), takes on an often comical direct route approach which usually leads to nowhere before finding another way by chance.  Sara, aided by her best friend (Molly Shannon), decides to run about NewYork randomly letting fate and instinct take control.  Their paths do cross several times before they meet, but of course they don't realise it.The story as a whole is kind of hokey, but you know that if John Cusack is a star that there will be some good dialogue and some decent twists of fate. The script does just that, steering clear of cliche's and making things less predictable than most movies of this genre.  Even then, events don't happen how we think they would.Peter Chelsom decided to use his talented cast instead of wasting their skills like Town and Country.  The ever impressive John Cusack turns in anther good, and less neurotic performance.  Kate beckinsdale spreads her wings a little wider than she could in Pearl Harbour which will hopefully let us see how good she can be.  Jeremy plays the best man with a little more depth of character than he usually portrays.  Also, Molly Shannon takes her spastic SNL persona down a few notches to play Sara's best friend. Lastly, Eugene Levy has a typecast, but funny role as a retailer who reluctantly helps out along the way.Without the decent direction of Peter Chelsom, and the talented cast, this movie could've taking a definate downward spiral.  I recommend you at least see it on video or make it a date movie.",Serendipity

280,messytaco,Ok but there are better movies out there,5,8 October 2001,"Serendipity is not a terrible film. It's a cute couple film. On occasion, it might make you think, though not about things like ""What is String Theory?"" More like ""What could make a person who's about to get married do the things that these characters do?""In terms of fulfilling the title and the theme of this film, the producers and director apparently felt the need to not only define the word serendipity (which while understandable, could have been done artfully) but to keep reminding you of the theme throughout.  You are never left on your own to identify what is ""serendipity"" and ""fate"" and this is kind of an insult, but. What can you do?I have to say that the audience with whom I saw the film diminished the film for me.  These were apparently the people who clap when your airplane lands. Though there isn't a single unpredictable moment in the movie, there were still some people in the theater with me who gasped when certain events unfolded.  I've got to tell you that if it surprises you when certain objects seen early in the movie turn up later, well, at least the world is still filled with wonder for you.And so, every time they gasped, it was a signal to me to contemplate just how hackneyed the script really was.  Also, unfortunately, John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale are as uncute as Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are acclaimed as cute (as a movie couple).  Cusack can play the greatest losers but he really struggles in films where he has to be a winner.  And Kate Beckinsale spends the entire movie wrinkling her nose and wearing a lot of mascara.  She is pretty, but, is that all she has to contribute? Jeremy Piven was entertaining as the 2nd banana, though it's clear that he, as the smartest character in the movie by 30 lengths, is the writer's alter ego.  He makes the best of his material.I give it a generous 5 out of 10.  I'm not sorry I saw it, and many will enjoy it.  I just wish it could have had a bit more nuance.",Serendipity

In those venues, you will except a typical Hollywood romance piece, without much original thought. The plot and performances are so formulaic, that I was bored silly with the predictability.  John Cusack does his usual witty and sensitive guy bit that he basically mailed in.  Molly Shannon and Eugene Levy rehash characters from their improv days.  Kate Beckinsale is soooooooo sweet as to be hollow.  Some of the dialogue is funny, the saving grace of this otherwise cookie cutter effort.Amidst all the formula, there is also a terrible message of leaving a great relationship based on a ""feeling.""  No character development on Cusack's role as to why he feels incomplete with his girlfriend/fiancee.  It's a pithy attempt to suggest that he is inspired by love.

The screenwriters approach every scene with the same attitude -- how can we reinforce the idea of love at first sight, kismet, etc. etc.  Like a bowl of sugary cereal, the first few bites are a treat.  After that, you start looking for something with substance. Cusack plays a variation of the character he has down pat and mails in the performance.

Where Sleepless in Seattle delivered what amounts to be the same message, albeit on a more subtle, somewhat more mature level, Serendipity delivers it with a sledgehammer, and then proceeds to pound it into your psyche for the next tedious hour and a half or so (and that's an hour and a half of my life I'll never get back again, thank you very much!!). It's bad enough the main characters of this movie have the emotional maturity level of fourteen-year-olds (actually I've known better fourteen-year-olds...), except maybe for Jeremy Piven, who was enjoyable enough. Just the first 15 minutes or so of the movie where Kate Beckinsale's character plays that annoying silliness of a game about throwing all sensibility to the wind (literally) had my best friend and I irritated beyond belief. I told my husband Rockstar had more intelligence, and at least, the characters in Rockstar weren't half as dysfunctional as the idiots were in this ""Serendipitous"" mess. It's annoying to watch protagonists who seem to have no clue about choice in their lives, and feel they're nothing more than puppets to destiny and the whims of fate. How utterly tiresome. I'm sure this movie will be more likely enjoyed by those who'd rather not engage in the chaotic messiness of making more complex life choices and then responsibly living with the consequences. After all, here's a movie where our hero and heroine live happily ever after only after wreaking havoc and misery on two other people's lives (namely their respective fiancées), not to mention other relatives and friends, just to get there.",Serendipity

Cusack, a New Yorker, has a random encounter with Kate Beckinsale, English charmer. They spend a day together, without knowing each other's name.  Rather than act on their obvious interest in each other, they agree (more her than him, because it's a ROMANTIC comedy) to let ""fate"" work.  Several years later, both of them are preparing to marry... other people.  You will enjoy Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon in the best friend roles, trying to beat common sense into the picture, then give up ultimately in the name of ""true love"". Add John Corbett and Eugene Levy in very funny supporting roles, and the fact that the movie uses music by Nick Drake (one of my favorites, another review another time), and I was sold.  I am usually no fan of those too-awkward moments that seem contrived in this genre, but even those moments in this film keep you grinning (the actress playing Sarah's sister borrowing the house comes to mind, and keep it in mind).

Sarah and Johnathon spend a few hours ice skating, talking and drinking the most amazing cappuccino, after meeting by chance Christmas shopping. There is a distinct chemistry from the start, but they are involved with other people, so meaning to do the right thing, they hesitantly depart twice (they are drawn together again the first time), knowing they will not see each other again. To cut a long story short, 10 or so years into the future, on the eve of their prospective wedding/engagement to different people, their minds wander once more to that fateful night and a chaotic race to find each other again to put their minds at rest begins. Despitite much running around and wild goose chases, there is a real moral at the heart of this film, which is, to quote the Epictetus line from the film: ""If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid"" Do not settle for a second best life because it is easy, you have to follow your heart to be truly happy even if its hard. Will Johnathon and Sarah do that? Well, you'll have to watch it and find out",Serendipity
298,chuong,Altogether Entertaining,9,16 December 2002,"By far the greater enjoyment in watching this film comes not from the storyline, but the great cast of characters, and the actors and actresses that portray them.John Cusack plays a believable, average guy who's likeable.  He's not overly-funny, serious, or pessimistic.  His character Jonathan is like a nice person you'd want to have a conversation with on any day of any week. His best friend is Dean Kansk, played by Jeremy Piven.  Dean is above all else a good and dependable friend, one that seems unfaillingly real.  I truly enjoyed Piven's performance... he seems molded to the role.Kate Beckinsale is Sara, a dreamer who doesn't really know what she wants. I've met women like this, and although I found her character to be under-played and under-acted, it might be because I really dont like Beckinsale much to begin with.  Her best friend Eve (Molly Shannon) is the female counter-part to Dean.  In my opinion, this is Molly's best performance.  She plays Eve as a realistic charming and caring friend. Her little quirks are so well timed and appear in such restraint that it was a joy to see her act.  Shannon really blew me away here.Levy and both lead characters' fiance/fiancee are all done in surprisingly good taste, not what one would expect out of hollywood (where characters are far too over-acted and end up being extreme in all aspects, even when temperance might be called for).  I don't really hold this film's plot/storyline against it.  It IS a romantic comedy, and what romantic-comedy isn't predictable?  The only thing I didn't really like was that through-out most of the movie, the lead actor and actress were not in each other's company/vicinity.  Thus, it's hard to see any kind of chemistry, if any.I went in expecting somewhat mildly-enjoyable, predictable fare.

299,mojoer_2000,Greatest Modern Romantic Comedy!!!,10,9 October 2002,"John Cusack is the greatest actor in this genre alive today, and this movie proves it.  He has a great ability to act alongside any actress as in Grosse Pointe Blank and America's Sweethearts.  His connection through fate with Kate Beckinsale made me think that maybe there's hope for me yet.  Maybe it's just wishful thinking but I would love it if someone like Beckinsale came into my life through fate.  She seems to have the ideal combination of pretty, funny, and smart.  ""Too bad she's famous!""  Jeremy Piven, as with in Grosse Pointe Blank, makes the ideal best friend.  It is tough to decide whether he has the funniest lines or if Eugene Levy does.  The other two female leads work well also.  Even though I don't particularly like Molly Shannon (think Superstar) She is funny in this movie.  Bridget Moynahan was a great pick to play John's fiance, because she would have been a good partner for his character if not for fates introduction of the two leads. She also showed a great range against the previous character of the tough bitch in Coyote Ugly (I liked her that way).  The only character that I didn't particularly like was John Corbett's character.  I don't think he was supposed to be completely, but he seemed self centered instead of being somewhat likeable.  The ending was definitely obvious, but it would have been disappointing otherwise.  But the path was a great ride.  It would have been better with someone to watch it with.",Serendipity

Why are people so critical these days. This was an incredibly sweet movie. John Cusack has been making movies like this (Better Off Dead, Sure Thing, Say Anything, and even Grosse Pointe Blank) for years. He has turned being the funny and likable everyman into an art form. This movie was certainly light and and fluffy but that was the point all along. This movie was supposed to remind us all of that special girl or boy that we met for maybe only a moment and yet still remember in exact detail years later everything about them. I think most men watching this film would think that way about Kate Beckinsale's character, she was absolutely adorable. Thank god we get to see a film with a beautiful woman who spends an hour and a half being lovely and a sweetheart instaed of the typical sex craved and materialistic cynics that we so often see. Kate Beckinsale's character was the exact opposite of Sex in the City's Sarah Jessica Parker. We've seen her bitch and whine and destroy herself relationship wise for several seasons now because she is ""sooo deeep, introspective, and cool"" yeah right. What a mess! Just lighten up gang and enjoy. The film is so incredibly sweet and innocent. Don't tear it apart. Don't analyze it. Just treat it like the wonderful little gem that it is and enjoy it.

Although I was reminded of Sleepless in Seattle through parts of the movie, it had enough differences to make it unique. They put just enough obstacles to make the movie interesting and not overly frustrating. I mean how many close calls can you have before finally running into each other again?

A firm believer in the power of fate, she refuses to give Jonathan her phone number  instead, she writes her name and number inside the cover of a book, which she then sells to a secondhand bookshop, telling him that if they are meant to be together, the book will find its way to him. Likewise, she makes him write his number on a banknote, which she promptly spends, telling him that if fate decrees it, the note will find its way back to her. A few years on, Jonathan and Sara are both engaged to other people, but each keeps thinking about whether the other is their true soulmate, and then they start to see signs which they interpret as the fates trying to tell them somethingThis is a charming romantic comedy  a heavy suspension of reality is required, but that's surely part of the point. Sara's willingness to leave her future to fate slightly beggars belief, but Beckinsale manages to make Sara appealing enough. It's prettily shot and perfectly paced  the movie never flags but everything pitches along perfectly towards the inevitable but agreeable conclusion (it also keeps itself to a restrained 90 minutes, which seems increasingly unusual among modern movies). Cusack is, as always, utterly adorable, with more sex appeal than 100 Brad Pitts. A little bit of perfect escapism.",Serendipity

She had traveled to NYC and he was at the point of having a wedding rehearsal. He was shown flying (?) with his friend, but the destination was not clear. He and his friend arrived at a house which I believed to be where Kate was living in? His friend peeped into the house and saw a couple making love. He then tried to restrain John Cusack from seeing what was going on inside. Were they still in NYC or in England? The woman inside the window appeared to be Kate Beckinsale. Was it someone else? If it was her, why did he not ask her about the guy when they finally met at the ice rink at the end of the movie? Since he called off his wedding because of her, you would have thought he would have asked about her other lover. If it was his fiancée, then why didn't he charge into the house and confront her? I think that was the only hole in the movie that left me a little confused. Overall, it was a nice romantic comedy, but it seemed a bit too short in duration to be able to develop the characters and story line.**UPDATE** I read some earlier comments about the movie and I think I got the answer to my earlier question. It seems that John Cusack flew to San Francisco (?) in search of Sarah. When he went to the house, her sister (?) was making love to a guy? I didn't recall any sister character being mentioned earlier in the movie? I think I will have to see the movie over again to see where the sister character first appeared.",Serendipity

315,nik_karas2004,something is wrong,9,5 July 2005,"I really liked this movie very much.Although it had a happy end ,I can t stop thinking about the two people who where obviously in love with Jonathan and Sara. They had a major role in the whole story,but in the end of the movie no one cares about them and their feelings...I can t even remember their names...I really wonder this is life?I just can t except that someone s happiness means misery for the other-one and that s simply OK.Perhaps we could say that they are taking what they deserve in that time of their lives and later they will be the winners.I really don t know what to say...I would like if you know to write any other movie in the same atmosphere.",Serendipity
316,kookiez_123,Greatest Movie of All Time,10,31 August 2006,"Since I first saw this movie, and until this day, there is not a movie that I would rate higher. The chemistry between John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale is astounding and is what makes this a great film. John Cusack plays the lovable ""everyday guy"" role in a lot of his films, and this is by far his greatest performance in that role. This film will make you laugh, and it will make you cry. It is the perfect date movie, and the perfect movie for anyone who has ever believed in 'fatum' (destiny). This is my #1 movie and I don't believe will ever change. I have watched it a countless number of times and each time is just as enjoyable as the first.On another note, the soundtrack to this movie is wonderful. To this day I cannot listen to ""Evan & Jaron - The Distance"" , ""Shawn Colvin - When You Know"" , or ""Annie Lennox - Waiting In Vain"" without thinking of this movie. All of these are great tracks, and they fit with the movie at their appropriate times very well.",Serendipity

318,pmillerwsc84,Soul-mates do exist,10,6 March 2006,"Definitely a must see for anyone that has ever experienced the feeling of being in love. I wish this movie had been done ten years earlier as I had a situation happen to me just like the one that happens to Sara and Jonathan. Only, I didn't follow my heart at the time and now wish that I had. Certain people come into our lives for certain reasons. If we listen to our hearts, we can often figure out these reasons. This movie has inspired me more than once to believe that soul mates do exist and that it's all right to follow your heart even when your head says otherwise. As long as you remember a past love, that love continues to exist. It's only when you forget that person that love dies. Watch this movie and believe in the magic of love!",Serendipity
319,margera_rulez36,Brilliant,10,1 February 2006,"I love Kate Beckinsale and this is one of her best movies because she is a brilliant actress and the role was perfect for her. its also made me want that book and i cant get hold of it. John Cusack was also really good in the film, i have started getting a lot of his movies and think he is a excellent actor. does anyone know what Lars's band actually is called? i kind of like the music.i have also noticed Kate's best movies seem to be when she is English in them especially underworld. although broke down palace is really good. because i loved the film so much i have just bought the script from ebay so i can read it and see if it as good.",Serendipity
320,elregent,Wonderful romantic fairytale,10,31 October 2018,"Like many others, I expected before watching this film, that I'd see an ordinary romantic comedy, as I had seen a lot earlierBut... This movie pleasantly surprised me. The Serendipity is one of the best love stories, a new year fairytale, which
reminds us, that miracles happen, and love with fate are not just mere words.The movie starts at the New-York city, where a man and a woman are met each other. Wonderful evening, new year mood, romantics...
But fate spread our characters to different corners of the earth.
Several years later... Each character has his own life, but can't forget that evening, that meeting... And they decide to try again,
to find each other. And you shouldn't forget about fate's role.Will our characters meet? Where will the fate bring them?Very light movie, that touches something inside your soul, one of the best movies about love and something more, that can
connect people once and for all life, the movie with a nice and light humor.For the best new year fairytale - 10/10",Serendipity
321,mitchell_jarvis,All time favourites,10,11 September 2019,For the belivers in fate and destiny. True love! This is one of my favourite films growing up. Real feel good movie. Kate Beckingsdale is gorgeous and stunning. John Cusack charming. Definitely worth a watch,Serendipity
322,donnagates,loved it own it and buy it for others,10,5 March 2006,I didn't really like John Cusack before or know who Kate Beckinsale was. But after seeing it which I had to see several more times and know own it is one of my favorite movies. maybe it's the romance or fate of the knowing of true love whatever it is I love it and now hope to move to new york one day because of it. It is truly a love story with continual twists just waiting and hoping to catch up to one another. You can see the outcome of course that would be a horrible twist but love it more and more whenever I see it even without all the goofs thanks for putting them there it just makes it more real. Like 13 going on 30 another movie about fate turns it's head to the right direction the actors and actresses show life's events and if we don't listen to our hearts we can miss out on the most important things. When Sara and Jonathan both forget there items and come back to the coffee shop at the same time don't you hope that he says and expect that he will say the perfect words? It's like telling us to live for the moment and not to let those pass by saying what we feel at that exact time and moment. She could have said no and been safe with the boyfriend and all but she did what we wouldn't do.,Serendipity
