0,MartinHafer,I have no idea why my first review was removed.,1,2 February 2019,"I wrote a review about why I hated this film some time ago. My Italian friend, Angelo, recently informed me it was removed. I have had this happen a few times...and each time it seemed to be because I hated a movie everyone else liked. I used no offensive language nor gave spoilers without warnings....and IMDB never explains WHY they remove some reviews. Perhaps they'll just remove this one as well.So why did I hate this film so much? Because if you loved the original series, this movie pretty much spits on these fans. They make the hero of the original, Jim Phelps, the villain. This is like doing a Barney movie and making him evil! So, no matter how good the stunts and action are (and they are actually utterly ridiculous at times in this movie), I simply was angry because they took a beloved character and destroyed him.",Mission - Impossible
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Some of the plot is convoluted, but it is very well made, has great music and is well directed and acted",8,23 May 2010,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I do agree the plot is confusing and convoluted at times though, but Mission:Impossible is very well made, with stylish cinematography, well chosen locations and inventive lighting. Plus the stunts and special effects are absolutely fantastic. Another strong asset is the music, the main theme is hypnotic and memorable especially, plus Brian DePalma's direction is brilliant. The film does move along very briskly, the script is efficient and the acting is also very well done. Tom Cruise is an actor I don't really care for but he is good here, but Jon Voight, Emanuelle Beart, Ving Rhames and Jean Reno are even better than he is. There are some very memorable scenes especially the burglary of a guarded vault and the Channel Tunnel helicopter pursuit. Overall, very well made and entertaining, if you forget the plot and just let the effects, stunts and visuals blow you away you will not be disappointed. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Mission - Impossible
2,Leofwine_draca,"Malnourished, convoluted, with a couple of decent set-pieces",4,29 August 2016,"Hitchcockian director Brian De Palma dips his hand into the action genre with this malnourished thriller, which, as is the case with many recent blockbusters, is all style over substance. The plot is little more than an excuse to string together a series of familiar action set pieces, none of which will cause the viewer to raise an eyebrow - unless it is at the outlandish activity which occurs at the film's finale. While some may enjoy the many twists and turns as double-faced characters betray each other, it just served to give me a headache. I was partially distracted while watching the film (through no fault of my own, I hasten to add), and this made it difficult to understand the various character's motivations, and especially who exactly was the main villain at the end of the piece. This is definitely one film which is too clever for it's own good.A familiar cast of faces fill out various roles, but hardly any of the actors and actresses are given much to do except mutter meaningful dialogue. Tom Cruise is an able action man, but he is just that: a muscular figure with little or no personality whatsoever. And no charisma. I liked Cruise in EYES WIDE SHUT, but his blank performance here left me cold. Jon Voight enjoys himself in a two-faced, villainous role, but again is given little to do apart from smile or sneer when the film requires him to. Probably the actor who comes off best here is Ving Rhames, playing a character who is never too serious and quite likable. Jean Reno is a good face to have in the cast too, but to my despair I found he was playing a villain and thus dies spectacularly at the end. For the female roles, Kristen Scott Thomas appears briefly at the beginning before thankfully dying: I was glad to see her go, as I can't stand this actress. Emmanuelle Beaurt lends some much-needed class to the proceedings, but her role is almost totally thankless and she hardly appears at all.Amid the fun (if expected) trappings of clever, hi-tech devices and traps (such as explosive chewing gum), there are a handful of action scenes on which the film concentrates. Firstly, the opening scene where Cruise finds his team massacred one by one is well executed, conveying well the despair Cruise feels as time after time he arrives too late to see one of his colleagues die. The set piece of the film occurs when Cruise and his cronies break into a sealed vault to steal information, this is an excellently-crafted moment which sustains the tension right up until the very end. Probably the best bit of the film. The final moments with the helicopter and train chase are fun too, even if they are a bit preposterous and slightly bend the laws of dynamics and movement (you'll know the moment I mean). All in all, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE is something of a hollow exercise, but with enough exciting moments to keep it mildly entertaining.",Mission - Impossible
3,SnoopyStyle,convoluted story but I don't care,7,19 October 2013,"Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is a secret IMF agent. His team has been infiltrated by a mole. When they go on their new mission, all are wiped out except for Ethan. The mission was actually a mole hunt, and the agency now thinks that sole survivor Ethan is the mole. He must fight to clear his name, and find the real mole.Director Brian De Palma has built an intense convoluted story. He tells an intriguing behind-the-scene story of the two writers writing competing scripts while the movie is in production. It's best not to think too hard and the movie doesn't really give you time to think. The clues, the new characters, and the action keeps coming without easy explanations. Tom Cruise is such a powerful presence that I don't actually question the story. I just enjoy the slick spy story. The action is fast and stylish. Realism and logic be damn.",Mission - Impossible
4,Horst_In_Translation,A pretty decent thriller that launched a long-running franchise,6,18 January 2017,"""Mission: Impossible"" is an American 110-minute movie from 1996, so this one is already over 20 years old. The director is Brian De Palma and the lead actor is Tom Cruise, possibly the biggest movie star back then when this film came out and still among the very biggest today, over 2 decades later. This film is based on a television series from several decades earlier, but of course most people don't know about that one, let alone have seen it (or episodes of it) and the movies are much more famous today. I said ""movies"" and this already tells you that several sequels were made and the franchise is still alive today because it keeps getting large crowds into theaters. As for this one here, the cast includes several known names, such as Cruise of course, but also Reno and Rhames are fun to watch. From the older generation, Jon Voight and Vanessa Redgrave are on board. Béart and Scott Thomas (in a pretty small role) play attractive women and Emilio Estevez has an okay cameo too. But all in all, it is really all about Cruise. The film does not offer too much in terms of performances and range really, but it does not have to do so in order to be a success.I think the film manages a good balance overall here. It starts with a real boom that is a crucial event linked to everything that happens afterward, the entire movie, so our attention is right there where it needs to be from the very start. This film is about a lot more than just dealing with the question: Who is the traitor? It is also interesting to follow Cruise's path to finding out the man's identity and that was the real challenge. But still, it was nice to see the coat and the suspense at the end. The train scene (more what happened inside than outside) was truly a highlight here, also with Max and Hunt's aides etc. But it is only the second best scene. The absolute highlight is of course the scene in which they steal all the data, really nerve-racking stuff and so tense that it will inevitable have you at the edge of your seat in its entirety. Certainly a contender for best movie scene of 2016 and I also think the writing there was very good with the temperature, sound sensors etc. This is thriller genre at its very best and judging from this scene alone, the film would have deserved an 8/10 at the very least. But sadly there were also some weaker moments such as the way Reno exits eventually or the plot twist at the end with Béart's character who was not half as memorable as she could have been. And there are others too. But nothing is so grave or bad to a level where it keeps this film from being a really good viewing experience. I highly recommend to check it out, if you are one of the few who haven't already. I myself will check out the sequels at some point in the future as well. Guaranteed. I give this one here, how it all started, a thumbs-up. Go see it.",Mission - Impossible
5,Prismark10,Mission: Impossible,8,9 January 2021,"After Brian De Palma managed to turn The Untouchables television series into a grandiose gangster film.Paramount Pictures lured De Palma back to turn the Mission: Impossible television series into a big screen action movie.De Palma a flawed director with a strong sense of visuals and an obsession with Alfred Hitchcock. Mission: Impossible is better viewed as a homage to the Hitchcock espionage thrillers such as North by Northwest.Tom Cruise plays a new character Ethan Hunt. The movie opens with a sequence where his star studded IMF team including its lead Jim Phelps (Jon Voight) are killed. They tried to stop the theft of a list containing the names of CIA spies from the American embassy in Prague by a rogue agent.As the only one left alive from his latest mission. Ethan's bosses suspect him to be a mole that they have been after for a while. The list was a decoy.Ethan has live up to his last name. He is hunted and is on the hunt for the real mole. He needs to seek out a shadowy arms dealer known as Max.Ethan also recruits two disavowed IMF agents to steal the real list from CIA headquarters as use that as bait.Mission Impossible is a high octane thriller with a complex plot. It is less gunplay and more set pieces with Cruise a willing participant to do as many stunts as he could get away with. The highlight is the the Channel Tunnel helicopter chase scene and the break in from the ceiling in the CIA vault.With De Palma at the helm, the film has a strong sense of his signature visual style. In fact Cruise made sure that subsequent sequels would have directors adding their own stamp to the movies.One controversy about Mission Impossible was the reveal that a beloved character from the television series would be a treacherous villain.In hindsight there is a bit of serendipity in the casting. Jon Voight was a liberal movie star whose career had hit the doldrums in the 1980s. By the mid 90s he made a comeback as a character actor in films such as Heat.In recent years Voight's journey in the political spectrum as moved very much to the evangelical right. After the 2020 Presidential Elections won by Joe Biden. Voight accused Democrats of stealing the election and being evil. An apologist for Donald Trump. I wonder just what did De Palma and Cruise suspect about him when they cast him as Phelps all those years ago!",Mission - Impossible
6,kosmasp,"No Story, unbelievable Action",5,4 April 2007,"For a movie that claims to be based on reality there are too much things that don't work in reality! I will only point out the two major flaws of the movie in this respect: 1) Tom Cruise falling with a fast pace towards a sensitive alarm wired floor! Yes he doesn't touch the floor, but the movie made us believe that this alarm that is installed in the floor is very sensitive ... well if it was, why didn't it go off? The pressure of the wind alone that Cruise's falling caused, should have triggered it (and I won't consider the fact, that a normal human being would be sweating like a pig, especially hanging like that ... any drop on the floor would have been the end of this heist/scam or whatever you want to call it) 2) The helicopter scene. Even people who like the movie more than me, do agree that this is totally bananas! Not only the fact that the helicopter goes into the tunnel or they used bad CGI (by today standards even more so), but for the fact that it literally stopped right in front of Mr. Cruise ... Again for a movie that tries to be real, a big suspension of disbelief isn't working here ...And then of course you have the BS plot, that anyone who has seen more than three thrillers can smell 10 miles against the wind ... Seriously it's so obvious and plain that there really is no suspense (oh and the fish tank explosion in the restaurant? What was that all about? Whatever!) Still the movie is shot and edited in a very professional way (you shouldn't expect otherwise from De Palma, the director here). And it has some action highlights (just not those I mentioned before!)",Mission - Impossible
7,gavin6942,More Than Adequate Action Film,7,25 November 2013,"An American agent (Tom Cruise), under false suspicion of disloyalty, must discover and expose the real spy without the help of his organization.Although the original cast disliked this new incarnation, I think they missed the point in a way -- this was not to be a strict continuation but more of a new beginning. Those lines might have been blurred if the old cast reprised their roles, but they did not, and I do not see this one in any way detracting from the television show.Stephen Holden of the New York Times wrote, ""If that story doesn't make a shred of sense on any number of levels, so what? Neither did the television series, in which basic credibility didn't matter so long as its sci-fi popular mechanics kept up the suspense."" I feel like this really nails it. The key is the suspense and not the plot. While more something you expect from Joel Schumacher than Brian De Palma, I think De Palma"" got it"".",Mission - Impossible
8,lee_eisenberg,Brian DePalma's descent,5,11 April 2006,"Get over it, people. ""Mission: Impossible"" was little more than an excuse to show off Tom Cruise. In fact, the only impossible thing in the movie was to understand the plot. Why is it that Brian DePalma, after a great resume (think ""Phantom of the Paradise"", ""Carrie"", ""Dressed to Kill"", ""Blowout"", ""Scarface"", ""Bonfire of the Vanities"", ""Carlito's Way"") have to go all Hollywood on us? To make matters worse, he followed it up with the even more ridiculous ""Snake Eyes"". I haven't seen any of his movies since then, but I read that they all sucked.All in all, this movie barely reflects the TV series. I never saw the sequel but I heard that it was basically the same, and for some reason they decided to make a third one to be released this summer. Hollywood just doesn't know when to quit, do they?",Mission - Impossible
9,jboothmillard,Mission: Impossible,7,10 March 2006,"Based on the popular TV series, this action spy thriller may be sound like an odd choice for director Brian De Palma (Scarface, The Untouchables), but actually, it works. Basically Jim Phelps (Jon Voight) and IMF (Impossible Missions Force) team, including Sarah Davies (Kristin Scott Thomas) and top agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) carry out a mission in Prague, and it goes badly wrong. Hunt seems to be the only survivor, and he is now on the run after the head of the agency Kittridge (Henry Czerny) suspects him as a culprit. Hunt is now using most unorthodox methods to find out who set him up and clear his name. One key scene sees Hunt trying to steal computer data from a heavily guarded, complicated and seemingly impossible security room, with the help of Luther (Ving Rhames) and Krieger (Jean Reno). In the end, Hunt finds the person who set him up, and it is someone you would least suspect, and it all comes to a head with an explosive fight on the fast moving Channel Tunnel train. Also starring Emmanuelle Béart as Claire Phelps, Vanessa Redgrave as Max, Dale Dye as Frank Barnes and Marcel Iures as Alexander Golitsyn. Cruise does well as the American version of James Bond, the supporting cast is good too, but I can agree with the critics, it is not the story to be enjoyed, it is the fantastic array of stunts and special effects. Tom Cruise was number 32 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 25 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!",Mission - Impossible
10,ccthemovieman-1,"Confusing, But Still Fun To Watch",8,29 March 2006,"Here's another film I watched when it came out and then later when the DVD was released and enjoyed both viewings, despite the fact I got ""lost"" several times. It's about time for another look because it's well-worth it and who knows....maybe I'll finally figure it out!If you get a little confused trying to follow the plot, don't feel stupid. This isn't an easy story to follow but it gets high marks for keeping it interesting despite that problem.The interesting characters, good cinematography, fun James Bond-like gadgets, just the right amount of action scenes and one very memorable heist scene with Tom Cruise dangling from a wire all make this an enjoyable two hours of entertainment. That scene with Cruise trying to break into this vault-like room remains as the one of the better tension-filled scenes I've ever witnessed on the big screen.The final action scene with the speeding train and helicopter also is very memorable. John Voight, Emmanuelle Beart, Henry Czerny and Jean Reno make it a fun cast to watch, too. Note: stick with this film and forget the sequel. Despite the confusion, this film is still fun to view.",Mission - Impossible
11,Tweekums,Who is the mole?,8,12 July 2012,"I had seen the odd episode of the television series as a child but it was long enough ago that by the time I came to watch the film I'd forgotten so much about it that I could view this as a totally new product; which is probably for the best. It was clear from early on that this was going to be a star packed adventure as the team included Tom Cruise; Kristen Scott Thomas, Emilio Estevez and Jon Voight at least it seemed that way until the first mission we see leaves most of the team dead and their target free with the 'NOC List'; a list giving the names and code names of every CIA asset in Eastern Europe! Cruise plays the team's leader, Ethan Hunt, and after that debacle the CIA believes he is the mole they already suspected somebody and as the sole survivor it must be him or must it? As part of their mole hunt they had placed a fake list so anybody who uses it will get caught. Soon it becomes clear that there was a second survivor; Claire Phelps. After some distrust he eventually decides that she isn't the mole and sets about finding who wanted the list so he can bait them with the real list and expose the mole.This is an exciting thriller with plenty of twists and turns before the end. The surprises started early when characters played by well known actors were killed off and continued right until the end when we learn which previously trusted characters are in fact bad. Tom Cruise puts in a solid performance as Hunt; it is of little surprise that he continued to play the role in an ever increasing franchise. The rest of the cast support him convincingly as Hunt and his new team work to catch the mole. There are plenty of exciting moments; the best being when they sneak into the CIA headquarters in Langley to steal the real file if you think too much about the scene it does seem somewhat ridiculous but it is so well handled it doesn't matter besides this is Mission Impossible after all! Things continue well until the very end then things get unfortunately silly as Hunt chases the bad guy on the roof of a speeding train as it heads towards the channel tunnel then enters the tunnel with a helicopter attached to it by a cable there is impossible and there is unbelievable; sadly this was the latter. That said this is just one scene and while it detracted from a previously good film it didn't spoil it for me. Fans of Cruise or of slightly far fetched thrillers should certainly enjoy this.",Mission - Impossible
12,ma-cortes,"First thrilling installation of the famous saga with non-stop action , rousing score and spectacular images",7,11 August 2015,"Top-notch entry of the Mission Impossible series filled with thrills , twists , turns and lots of action . Mission : Impossible¨ by Brian De Palma boasts a very good cast such as Tom Cruise , Ving Rhames , Jon Voight , Henry Czerny , Kristin Scott Thomas , Vanessa Redgrave Emmanuel Beart , Jean Reno . The undercover unit comes into action with several fine spectacular scenes . The crack undercover agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is called into action by IMF staff (John Voight) , his assignment is a crucial mission to prevent the theft of classified material . The outfit formed by stalwarts specialists (Emilio Estevez , Emmanuel Beart , Kristin Scott Thomas) execute a dangerous operation in Praga . But the team is double-crossed and things go wrong , causing Ethan Hunt and his new team to go to clear his name . As American agent , under false suspicion of disloyalty ,he must discover and expose the real spy without the help of his organization . Meanwhile , Ethan and his undercover new bunch (Ving Rhames , Jean Reno) try to discover who set them up . Ethan and his group carry out a dangerous caper at Langley , Virginia , breaking into the CIA's most impenetrable vault . This energetic movie packs unstopped action , hair-raising suspense , exciting thriller , frenetic pursuits and lots of violence . Well made high-tech hijinks and full of breathtaking set-up with impressive frames such as the climactic train sequence that took 6 weeks to film at the 007 stage at Pinewood Studios . And the exterior shots of the train scene, supposedly with the train in France, were mostly shot in Scotland . Tom Cruise performed a lot of sequences where Ethan Hunt executes his risked missions without the use of a stunt double . As during the filming of production , Tom Cruise did the majority of his own stunts including the CIA vault sequences to show the audience it was actually him ; this would allow director Brian De Palma to have more capabilities with camera angles & not having to hide the fact it is a stuntman doing the stunts . When Ethan is suspended by a cable while infiltrating the CIA vault results to be the series trademark , but it is ripped off from ¨Topkapi¨ by Jules Dassin . As it also appears in M.I. 2 (2000) and Mission: Impossible III (2006), Jeremy Renner also did this in Mission Impossible : Ghost Protocol . The film contains an interesting as well as twisted story in flamboyant treatment , worth two hours'time, with screenplay and story written by David Koepp , Robert Towne , Steven Zaillian and based on the vintage characters by Bruce Heller . Lalo Schifrin's classic score television is again well reused here , at a much higher decibel level and adding a stirring soundtrack by Danny Elffman , fitting perfectly to action . Fascinating and luxurious cinematography by excellent cameraman by Stephen H. Burum . As usual, Tom Cruise co-executive produced , along with J. C. Calciano , Paul Hitchcock and Paula Wagner . The motion picture was compellingly directed by Brian De Palma . He's a successful producer , writer and director with a lot of hits such as ¨Sisters ¨, ¨Dresssed to Kill¨, ¨Blow out¨ , ¨Obsession¨ : all of them are outwardly odes to Hitchcock ; furthermore , he also made unforgettable flicks : ¨Scarface¨ , ¨Untouchables¨ , ¨Carlito's way¨ , ¨Femme Fatale¨ , ¨The Black Dahlia¨ , among others . ¨MI 1¨ , rating : Better than average and well worth seeing . The tale will appeal to Tom Cruise fans and unstop action movies fans . The film had big success at the box office worldwide , becoming one of the highest-grossing installment in the franchise .Other installments from this popular and successful series are the followings : ¨ ¨Mission : Impossible II¨ by John Woo with Dougray Scott , Thandie Newton , Richard Roxburgh , John Polson , Brendan Gleeson ; ¨MI 3¨ (2006) by J. J. Abrahams with Philip Seymour Hoffman , Ving Rhames , Maggie Q , Jonathan Rhys Meyers and ¨MI 4¨ by Brad Bird with Paula Patton , Simon Pegg , Jeremy Renner , Michael Nyqvist and ¨Mission : Impossible V¨ (2015) by Christopher McQuarrie with Jeremy Renner , Simon Pegg , Ving Rhames , Rebecca Ferguson , Sean Harris , Alec Baldwin and , of course , Tom Cruise",Mission - Impossible
13,BA_Harrison,Mission: Impenetrable.,6,30 March 2017,"When the rest of his team are killed during a mission, IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) tries to find out who is responsible.Director Brian De Palma has given us some real classics during his illustrious career (Phantom of the Paradise, Carrie, Scarface, The Untouchables), but Mission: Impossible isn't one of them, despite a couple of well handled scenes of suspense, a rousing finale, and an impressive cast (Jean Reno, Ving Rhames, Jon Voight, Emmanuelle Béart) headed by Hollywood megastar Cruise. The main problem with the film is that it is far too convoluted for its own good, the complex story-line twisting and turning so much that it's hard to keep track of who is on Ethan Hunt's side and who isn't. There is also far too much of Hunt as he taps away on a computer keyboard: I don't know about you, but watching someone surf the web or download information onto a disk isn't what I want from my multi-million dollar Summer blockbuster.Thankfully, the boredom caused by Hunt's excessive computer usage is alleviated somewhat by the film's more outlandish elements: Hunt's rubber disguises that are life-like enough to hold up to close inspection, explosive chewing gum, and lots of high-tech gadgetry that now looks incredibly dated and therefore proves rather amusing. The aforementioned closing action sequence, which sees Hunt clinging to the side of a speeding train in a tunnel while being pursued by a helicopter, is also a whole lot of fun, albeit one of the dumbest things I have ever seen on the big screen. To round things off, Cruise does his patented 'arms and legs flailing while blown through the air by a big explosion' routine.5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.",Mission - Impossible

Since the sequel outdo's this one, I have to say though, this film wasn't that bad the first time I saw it.  The only problem was I understood the plot as well as any other person in the theater (no clue whatsoever).  But the second time, I understood it a little more.  Tom Cruise is good as Ethan Hunt, but not perfect here.  He improves with practice, and this is practice.  Still, the action sequences are memorable (especially the infamous drop in the office scene) and the supporting cast works well (Jean Reno, Jon Voight, Kristen Scott-Thomas, Emilio Estevez, and Ving Rhames).

Based on from the television series of the same name, the story follows a new agent,Ethan Hunt,played by Tom Cruise. His new mission is to uncover the mole within the CIA who has framed him for the murders of his entire IMF team.The stunts are thrilling but not exceptional. While the story is good although it does not really require deep thinking as everything is explained in the end.Too bad that the film made Jim Phelps the villain in the end and it became the so-called ""The Ethan Hunt Show"" as it focused on the Cruise character which negated and ignored the fact that the IMF needed each other and worked with each other.

18,CinemaSerf,"Good cast, story, director - what's not to like?",7,25 December 2020,"I'm not the biggest fan of the diminutive Mr Cruise - but I have to hand it to him here. Brian de Palma has created an end-to-end action adventure and he is superb in it. He brings oodles of charisma to the screen as he (""Ethan Hunt"") has to recover from a disastrous mission and build a team to discover not only who betrayed them, but to obtain a top secret list of American overseas operatives (i.e. spies) before it falls into enemy hands spelling doom for all concerned. What ensues is a fast-paced, well constructed movie that moves along cohesively with plenty going on - loads of tension, suspicion, nobody knowing whom to trust coupled with plenty of exciting stunts and a classy performance from Vanessa Redgrave bringing some gravitas to the proceedings as the stylish, but ruthless, ""Max"". Sure, it relies on tech and CGI a lot of the time, but the ensemble - Ving Rhames, Emmanuelle Béart and Jon Voight all deliver well into a plot that keeps us guessing until well into the denouement. Even Henry Czerny - not noted for the flexibility of his performances - turns in a decent effort and the ending might make you think twice before using the Chunnel! If you're looking for a good, high-octane piece of cinema; then this is certainly up there - on a big screen, if you can.",Mission - Impossible
19,zardoz-13,Exciting But Nothing Like the TV Series,8,4 August 2015,"The transition that ""Mission Impossible"" made from the small screen to the big screen ignited considerable controversy. The beloved character that Peter Graves originated on television named Jim Phelps became a treacherous rogue agent that Jon Voight played as a villain in the film that director Brian De Palma helmed. Hardcore ""Mission Impossible"" fans have never forgiven either Tom Cruise or Brian De Palma for this sacrilege. The first ""Mission Impossible"" suffers from contrivances galore. Nevertheless, ""Mission Impossible"" emerges as an exciting, suspenseful nail-biter with three electrifying set-pieces: the opening computer heist debacle at an American embassy, the white-knuckled scene in the vault at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, and the chilling train ride sequence as the finale that culminates with a helicopter being dragged by a train through the claustrophobic confines of a tunnel. The CIA vault scene ends up being the best, with the other two are slickly done. The story opens with a brief vignette that features American espionage agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise of ""Risky Business"") masquerading as an older, mustached man orchestrating a ruse against an enemy agent by convincing his adversary that he has been instrumental in the death of a young woman. As soon as Hunt extracts the information from his disheveled adversary, they incapacitate him, revive the girl, Claire (Emmanuelle Béart of ""Don Juan""), who is playing possum and tear down the fake motel. The next thing we know we are introduced to the cinematic incarnation of Jim Phelps, and ""Mission Impossible"" adheres slavishly to the television formula with IMF chief Phelps receiving the usual briefing from a disc that self-destructs after he is told about his latest mission should he decide to accept it. Phelps relies on his right hand man, Ethan Hunt, to coordinate the operation in Prague. The IMF is supposed to record the pilfering of the CIA's master list of Eastern Europe spies. During the mission, everything goes haywire, and everybody but Hunt dies. Ultimately, we learn that neither Phelps nor his wife Claire died. The Phelps couple staged their own deaths. Naturally, since Hunt is the last man standing, his CIA superior Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny of ""Ice Castles"") suspects that he may culpable of the crime. The big revelation for Hunt is the discovery that the entire operation was 'a mole hunt' to expose a saboteur. The resourceful Hunt manages to escape from Kittridge when he uses explosive chewing gum to blow up the aquarium restaurant where he met with the CIA chieftain.Holing up in a Prague safe house, Hunt finds himself caught between a rock and a hard place. Eventually, he smokes out an arms dealer, Max (Vanessa Redgrave of ""Blow-Up"") who pays him to steal the spy list. Since he cannot call on his former comrades because they are dead, Hunt enticed disavowed computer specialist Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames of ""Pulp Fiction"") and pilot Franz Krieger (Jean Reno of """"Flyboys"") who can fly a helicopter through anything. The theft of top-secret computer documents from Langley ranks as the best scene in ""Mission Impossible"" with our intrepid hero dangling from a rig in the ceiling to make himself inconspicuous to the vault security gauntlet. Watching Krieger as he uses his muscles to keep Hunt from tripping the security alarms is taut stuff. The exit that they make disguised as firefighters is clever. Like its small screen predecessor, the cinematic ""Mission"" features spectacles that boast built-in TV cameras, hidden microphones, laptop computers, agents in sophisticated covers, exploding cars, exploding chewing gum, stabbings, gunplay, bodies toppling into a river, etc.",Mission - Impossible

Well, let me say this, after watching it about 5 times you will understand it completely and you don't even understand anymore why you didn't got it the first time. But even without fully understanding the movie you can very much appreciate this movie, like also I did the first time I saw it.The movie even is enjoyable for the Brian De Palma hater. His style is present (so there also is enough to enjoy for the De Palma fans, like myself) but not in such a way that it distracts in any way for the more casual viewer.Venessa Redgrave and Tom Cruise really seemed to be enjoying themselves playing together in this movie. You can tell they had lots of fun in their scene's which for me makes those scene's really enjoyable to watch. But again there is also plenty to enjoy for the more casual viewer. The exciting CIA break in is already a classic and the spectacular ending on the TGV also doesn't disappoint.The music from Danny Elfman is typically his style and suits the movie surprising well, he delivers one of this best works till date.""Mission: Impossible"" deserves more credit than it gets. Don't let the complex story scare you of.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Mission - Impossible
22,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Take it for what it is,7,1 January 2010,"I haven't watched much at all of the original show; I do know that this screws over the fans, and ruins stuff that they loved. Beyond that, it takes a different approach than the series. I guess it had to; the silver screen, you know. You can't do the same thing as on TV, it has to be bigger. Thus, this focuses on one person(not an entire team), and from early on in this, he's without the support of the IMF(were they *actually* called that before these? When did it start, anyway? Is there literally like, a supervisor sitting somewhere, deciding if a mission is quite impossible enough for them to handle?). All of that is really to be expected; if it turns you off to this, then so be it. I urge you to stick with your season sets, and not go for these. This has a complicated plot(with that said, you can follow it), perhaps to outdo the earlier stories. For a spy-thriller, this is quite good. It holds up pretty nicely, there are unpredictable twists, and the suspense is *excellent*. The famous ""suspended from the ceiling"" sequence *is* as great as you've heard. There is not an awful lot of shootouts or chases, but it is exciting, and the action is cool and well-done. This is a bit of a vehicle for Cruise, and he uses his charm in at least one scene that was probably written once he was cast. With that said, he does well. The characters are credible. Acting is masterful, with few exceptions. Elfman does marvelously, scoring this save for the classic theme. There is occasional moderate to strong language, and some bloody violence in this. The DVD holds a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to anyone into tense films that require you to pay attention. 7/10",Mission - Impossible
23,view_and_review,Impossible... Psshh,7,17 September 2020,"""Mission: Impossible"" (1996) started it all. A rollercoaster of a franchise has ensued with one film after another of advanced tech and advanced stunts. I'd seen the image of a dangling Tom Cruise catching his sweat droplet so many times that I thought I'd seen the whole movie.Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) loses just about his whole team trying to intercept a criminal seeking to steal a NOC list (list of undercover agents' identities). Someone within the IMF (Impossible Mission Force) is responsible, but Ethan doesn't know who.It's a game of high-tech espionage from beginning to end in which the smartest players win.

As a result, Ethan has to go underground and find the actual traitor using what few resources are available to him while being targeted by everyone in the agency. On top of that, the people he manages to scrounge up have their own issues which make it extremely difficult for him to trust any of them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I thought that this was a pretty good movie which managed to maintain the suspense from start-to-finish rather well. It also had a very intricate plot and for that reason viewers have to stay alert throughout the movie or risk missing a vital piece of the puzzle.

The names of America's double agents are contained on a computer disc and he must prevent it from being stolen. Before that, he and his team must photograph the evidence of the theft taking place. While certainly entertaining the story derails into implausible action scenes as oppose to the cleverness of the TV show. It is unfortunate that this is the biggest hit for director Brian De Palma. He is a skillful director whose talent has been applied to better films such as Sisters and Dressed to Kill. The film is well made technically but perhaps more on the spy mission would have elevated it to a more intelligent level. Cruise holds his own as the spy but the same cannot be said of the supporting players. Capable actors such as Jon Voight, Ving Rhames and Jean Reno labour under flat material. Kristin Scott Thomas makes an appearance amongst the less fortunate in the pointless opening. Filled with exhilarating action that are as far fetched as they come but its biggest fault is subduing itself in the action as oppose to clever writing. To actually hire a real screenwriter would be an impossible task I suppose. Score: 3 ½ / 10",Mission - Impossible

Expect convoluted dialogues, espionage gadgets, high society galas, foggy cobblestone streets, sudden deaths, globetrotting, double agents, capers and mind-blowing action.One thing that turned me off was the several occasions where a person's fake face is torn off à la Scooby-Doo. Once would've been enough, but three times? What were the writers thinking? Other than that cavil, this is a quality spy/caper flick; it's just too tortuous for my tastes with not enough human interest.The film runs 1 hour, 50 minutes, and was shot in Prague; London, Pinewood Studios & various other areas in England; and McLean, Virginia, & Washington DC.GRADE: B-",Mission - Impossible
28,Aaron1375,This missions plot would have been more appropriate for a sequel.,6,19 March 2010,"I went to see this one in the theaters and I have to say while it was not a boring movie, it was rather disappointing. I was expecting more action and such as all the trailers showed that scene with the exploding helicopter that sends Tom Cruise's character flying, however scenes like that are few and far between in this movie. The plot was a bit much too. We are just being introduced to Mission Impossible on the big screen and their first assignment and their first team meet with failure and the lead guy, Ethan Hunt, is suspected of being a traitor of some sort. Meanwhile, Jim Phelps is missing or something, some strange computer heist is having to be pulled off with a new team and for some reason one of the members of this new team ends up being a bad guy piloting the helicopter at the end. Like I said seems more like a sequel plot to me, I much would rather have seen a more straight forward mission that was pulled off successfully first than the bungled mess that was the first caper depicted in this one. I was also disappointed by the fact Emilio Estevez was in this film and quickly removed as he could have added some good humor to this one. This film also suffers from the same problem all the Mission Impossible movies suffer from, the fact that none of them are particularly memorable. This one I remember certain scenes all right and the basic plot and the strange English woman, but a lot of the movie is kind of hazy to me as well. Though the second one of the series suffers from this problem the most.",Mission - Impossible
29,The_Void,Slick and stylish action flick,8,30 August 2005,"Based on the TV show of the same name, Brian De Palma's stylish thriller stars Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt; a James Bond-esquire secret agent working for a certain section of the government. As the title suggests, many of the scenarios in the film are extremely unlikely; but then again, the film wouldn't be living up to it's title if they weren't. It's one thing to criticise it's stunts for being overblown, but if they weren't, critics would be on it's back and calling it things like 'Mission Possible', so really you've just got to go with it. Brian De Palma makes it easy to just 'go with it' by way of an intriguing plot line, a constant array of high-octane sequences and lots of his trademark style! The plot does get a little too convoluted for it's own good at times, and sometimes it's a little hard to follow; but it gives the film a good basis for all manner of impossibilities, so it serves it's purpose. We follow Ethan Hunt and his team. After a botched mission, Hunt finds himself on the run from his employers after being accused of disloyalty. Hunt must now pull out all the stops to stay one step ahead of his pursuers and get to the bottom of why their mission went wrong.The film features a number of stunts, the best of which sees Tom Cruise breaking into the CIA via the roof. This sequence is brilliantly executed, with De Palma managing to inject bucketloads of suspense into the scene. This scene fits the tone of the film as it's brooding and cerebral, but the film ditches that idea for it's conclusion, which sees a bullet train, a helicopter and the Channel Tunnel combine to great effect! The problem with all these stunts is that the parts between the action sequences aren't all that interesting, and at times can slow the film down to walking pace. This isn't a big problem, however, because there's always more action around every corner and that keeps the film going. Tom Cruise obviously has charisma and can lead a film, but I often find it hard to buy him in action roles. This one suits him, though, as although his character is still more than capable, he comes off as being quite vulnerable, and lucky at times, and that suits Cruise's persona. On the whole, while this isn't a great film; it makes for good entertainment and if that's what you're in the mood for, Mission: Impossible wont disappoint.",Mission - Impossible
30,Sylviastel,The movie is not impossible to understand!,10,7 October 2005,"Granted, I heard terrible things about this film before I saw it on video. After watching this film several times, I got the plot but I also get a little more each time. I love watching Dame Vanessa Redgrave as a female criminal mastermind in this role. I also enjoyed a bit known actor, Rolf Saxon, an American expatriate living in London, as William Donloe. Remember he's the poor sucker that gets the blame for a breaking an entry that caught him off guard. I like Rolf Saxon as the gullible American in this film. He's the best part of the film in my opinion and the surprise to me since I became a fan of his in 1994 after watching old Capital City episodes. I believe did his job extremely well and deserved to be listed in both beginning and ending credits of the film. I love John Voight and can't imagine why Angelina Jolie doesn't want much to do with him. I felt Tom Cruise was adequate. I like Vingt Rhames and Henry Czerny in the their roles. I forget the French actress who was Voight's wife. That's too crazy to believe. I thought that Kristin Scott-Thomas and Emilio Estevez deserved more time on screen but that's the movie for you. I loved the Prague setting, Virginia countryside, and London as well.",Mission - Impossible

The spycraft is more emphasized here (although that's really in the service of the big set pieces (a gripping vault caper and insane helicopter/train scene).

34,JamesHitchcock,"Insubstantial, but also stylish and fast moving",6,10 January 2008,"Until I caught this film on television recently, I had only seen the second episode in the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise. I must say that I was not impressed by ""Mission: Impossible II"" which struck me as a leaden, humourless attempt to make a James Bond-style spy thriller and which had dissuaded me from seeing either of the other two instalments. The first film, however, is a very different beast from its successor. The differences are doubtless due to the fact that the two films were made by two very different directors. ""Mission: Impossible II"" was made by John Woo, best known as the director of violent action-adventures. Its predecessor was made by Brian de Palma, who has a reputation for Hitchcockian suspense thrillers such as ""Dressed to Kill"", and has many of the hallmarks of a de Palma film. ""Mission: Impossible"" is based on the old television series of that name, familiar from my childhood, and borrows a number of elements from it, such as the distinctive theme tune, the character of Jim Phelps and catchphrases such as ""Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is"". (That one always used to baffle me as a child. Are spies really given the opportunity to say which assignments they will accept and which they will decline?) Although it does incorporate Bond-like elements, it is more like a cross between a Bond-style film and those paranoid Cold War thrillers such as ""The Spy who Came in from the Cold"", where the hero was never sure whom he could trust and where anyone, including the hero's closest associates- perhaps even the hero himself- could turn out to be a double, or even a triple, agent. (In this it differs from the original series, which generally reflected the moral certainties of the Cold War seen as Good v Evil). The film opens with Phelps and a team of agents on a mission to prevent a traitor from stealing a computer file containing identities of all America's double agents and then passing this information on to terrorists and criminal gangs. (This was made after the fall of the Berlin Wall, so the Russians are no longer the villains. The film, however, follows the tradition of using Eastern European cities as the setting for spy thrillers, so the mission takes place at an Embassy reception in a misty, mysterious-looking Prague). Unfortunately, the team have been betrayed and all of them except Phelps, his wife Claire and an agent named Ethan Hunt are killed. Because Hunt survives he immediately comes under suspicion of being the traitor who betrayed the team, so he is forced to go on the run. The rest of the story centres upon Hunt's attempts to elude his pursuers and to unmask the real mole. Another reviewer complains that most of De Palma's recent movies have been more about style than content. That assessment is, I think, true of this film. As one might expect with de Palma, there are a number of stylish directorial set-pieces. Probably the most memorable is the sequence in which a high-speed train, with Hunt clinging to the roof, is followed into the Channel Tunnel by the helicopter which is trying to kill him. (In reality, of course, the Tunnel is not wide enough for such a manoeuvre to be feasible, although this was presumably a deliberate error committed in order to increase the suspense. Most of the audience will probably assume, as I did as soon as I saw the entrance to the Tunnel looming, that the chase will end as soon as the train enters it). Another memorable scene comes where Hunt is trying to steal important information from the CIA headquarters, even though the computer containing the data is in a vault protected by all sorts of hi-tech devices, including temperature sensors and infra-red light beams. (This scene may have inspired a similar one in ""Entrapment"", made three years later, where Catherine Zeta Jones has to avoid a similar network of beams). As is normal in films of this type the plot is not only extremely complex- indeed, at times it is so complex as to be virtually impossible to follow- but also, at times, extremely implausible. Hunt is played by Tom Cruise who, despite his superstar status, does not seem really suited to a Bond-style action hero, lacking the suave, debonair charm of, say, a Pierce Brosnan whose first Bond film, ""Goldeneye"", had been made the previous year. (I must say, however, that Cruise is better here than he was to be in ""Mission: Impossible II""). The result is a film which is, in many ways, insubstantial, but also fast moving and often stylish and enjoyable. 6/10",Mission - Impossible
35,Smells_Like_Cheese,"To be honest, I wasn't that impressed",4,28 April 2006,"I had heard quite a bit for Mission Impossible, especially now that the third one is about to come out in the theaters. I knew my parents owned the first Mission Impossible, but due to the crazy antics Tom Cruise has pulled on... well... basically everyone, he has pretty much turned me off of his movies. But, I figured to give the Mission Impossible movies a shot.While over all this is an exciting action/spy flicks, there were only a few scenes in the movie I felt were worth the watch. Obviously the exciting scene of Tom coming through the ceiling on wires and copying the information onto disk. The last action sequence of the helicopter and train with Ethan and our surprise villain, very well thought out, unrealistic, but exciting to watch.

37,OllieSuave-007,An interesting but slow mission.,5,1 April 2016,"Part One in the Mission Impossible trilogy is a steady-paced action movie with lots of talking. There is really no action in the story until a good three quarters in the movie, where Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) goes on his impossible mission in a high-security computer room at CIA Headquarters to copy a top secret coverts agents list. That scene was an edge-of-your-seat experience.Much of the movie relied on the dialog, suspense and drama surrounding the Impossible Mission Force's (IMF) suspicion of Hunt's disloyalty to the organization and his mission in exposing the real spy and preventing the theft of classified material.As mentioned above, the mission scene was an exciting one, but much of the plot suffers from a slow pace and somewhat mediocre acting (literally with every character), which doesn't help in making the movie more suspenseful or intriguing. It's really a lot of all-talk and no action.The overall story is interesting and there are some plot twists and unpredictable moments. However, some more action and better acting would have been better.Grade C-",Mission - Impossible
38,sddavis63,Typical Tom Cruise Action Movie,6,29 August 2008,"I've never seen the 1960's TV series of the same name on which this film was based, so I find myself comparing it to other action flicks, and especially to other films starring Tom Cruise. I've never found Tom Cruise to be among the finest actors I've seen, but what I generally like about his performances and his movies was present here in great abundance. The movie is fun, fast paced and full of action and energy. At times it can leave you breathless. Those qualities sometimes become its weakness, too, though. It's almost too fast in a few places, leaving your head spinning around a plot that I didn't think was either well developed or well explained and the end result of some of the extreme action is that some parts of the movie can seem quite slow in comparison. Some of the action scenes in the movie (especially the helicopter chasing the train through the Chunnel) was a bit too over the top.The movie centres around Ethan Hunt, a US secret agent who becomes suspected of treason after a mission he's on goes awry and his team is killed. The viewer knows he's innocent - the question is who's the real mole? I found reason to suspect a number of people - perhaps there were too many to suspect, actually. I don't want things spelled out too clearly, because that would take the fun away, but I like to be able to have a clear enough story to be able to make an intelligent guess rather than just a wildcard bet.The performances here I thought were nothing to write home about. Not bad, but nobody really stood out to me as superb, either. It's a fair to middling action movie that's fun to watch - but there are better action movies out there. 6/10",Mission - Impossible
39,thesar-2,Mission for Dummies,4,26 February 2013,"(This review is heavy on spoilersbut it's also 16 years old and it's your fault if you haven't seen this yet)Perhaps it's unfair to finally get around to re-watching and reviewing the original 1996 Mission: Impossible. The evolution of each movie is so clear that this looks it was a lost episode of the 1960s TV show it was based on.And it feels like it's been that long since I've seen this. I remember disliking it and wrongfully being confused – I can't see why now, but I never realized how much I didn't care for it. Mercifully and much like the franchise has evolved, the original does get better as it progresses.Only your mission is to get through the first half before the fun begins.The movie opens up with what I'm guessing is 1st year spies. It's one thing to explain to the audience this gadget does this, or causes this harm, but for the characters to act foolish like they know less than the typical non-espionage viewer, is just plain pathetic. Prime example is poor, out-of-place, Kristin Scott Thomas who, apparently, never heard of either the TV program or any spy-film before.Worse than these high school dropouts posing as international agents, is that they kill off the majority of the team within 25 minutes from the start. YOU DON'T DO THAT – or the original series wouldn't have lasted as long, obviously.And what's even worse than that? (Fast forwarding to the end) YOU DO NOT MAKE JIM PHELPS THE BAD GUY. Seriously? I can see why they did it – the star, Tom Cruise, wasn't going to play the older, white-haired leader and they (or most likely he) wanted to give the pending franchise to his Ethan Hunt character. Fine, but you still don't make the long-lasting hero the villain. You don't even kill him off – just make him retire, disappear using his own skills, etc.Anyhoo, the movie focuses a diskette containing undercover CIA operative's names purposely getting into the wrong hands to both capture the bad guys and revealing the double agent. Yes, I said diskette – the old 3½ inch diskette that probably couldn't even hold the contents of this review, let alone any kind of list as big as described in the movie.I digress. As mentioned, the amateurish crew is dismissed early and Ethan ""Wake up, Claire! Jim's dead! He's DEAD! They're ALL DEAD!"" Hunt is blamed. This is where it gets good – for a few moments. After he meets the fantastic Vanessa Redgrave as Max, he recruits future staple and great Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and short-timer Franz Krieger (Jean Reno) to break into the CIA headquarters and the (at the time) wildly original, tense and fantastic wire-hanging scene takes place.Of course, just so the movie does escalate past the 2 stars I gave it, during the best scene, there's a rat – REALLY? – that scares/distracts Franz in an air duct. Much like the first half of the movie, this makes me feel they weren't taking any of this too seriously, making this just a few steps above Get Smart.Following that, and literally jumping to the end, there's a fantastically unrealistic leap of faith from a helicopter and a super-train in a tunnel that makes me unintentionally laugh every time I see it.The movie made a huge mistake of being mostly spy and very little action, whereas Part II was also wrong at playing the opposite card. Luckily, they *finally* hit their stride with Part III and Ghost Protocol that, rightfully, matched both needed qualities equally.This actually very slow ""action"" movie, which does contain a somewhat reminiscent of older spy-films, albeit dumbed down, was just a misstep from fairly decent director, Brian De Palma. It's almost worth a shot, just to find out who Ethan Hunt is and why Jim Phelps doesn't show up in the sequels. It did contain some decent cinematography and a very good score, but overall it's a miss. Thankfully, the sequels, with the exception of parts III and Ghost Protocol, are pretty much stand alone so you don't have to endure this experience.""I've been disavowed,"" says Ethan.

It's Kittridge suspicions that Hunt is working for the mysterious arms dealer Mr. Max, who's actually a Mrs, in trying to obtain the NOC List, a list of every CIA Agent in Eastern and Western Europe, for him at the price of a cool 10 million in non negotiable US Government Bonds.

the way the helicopter driver, after succeeding in picking up his partner, decided to try to kill Tom cruise instead of leaving and winning was absurd. not to mention he tried to do it by using the helicopter blades to kill his face without touching the train. not to mention this helicopter is successfully flying through a tiny tunnel while it's attached to the train the seems to be going 100mph. the twist was SO obvious, altho I was surprised Jean Reno was in on it. expected Jim and his wife. for a CIA computer that was so heavily secured with layers of methods to detect if anyone was in the room when they shouldn't be, I think it would've been a little smarter if they had a detection of the computer being used when no one was in the room",Mission - Impossible
42,Robert_duder,This is one mission you MUST choose!!!,9,19 April 2006,"Mission Impossible will stand the test of time and will be a classic action film and series. I haven't seen an episode of the original TV series in many, many, many years so it in no way effected by opinions of the film blockbuster. Mission Impossible is everything an action film needs to be and easily embodies everything that great action classics have. A top drawing movie star in Tom Cruise, a really good villain, a big action film director, an enormous budget, and a complex and intriguing story line with plenty of action scenes.Tom Cruise headlines the cast as disavowed agent Ethan Hunt. Now say what you will (and people are saying plenty nowadays) about Cruise but I still think he's a powerful star and a great on screen presence and this was no exception. The character is not entirely difficult or complex but Hunt is suave, smart, well trained and a great hero and Tom Cruise pulls it off flawlessly and no one else could play Hunt. He's perfect in this role!! Jon Voight is his mentor and father figure as well as the perfect adversary as he takes a turn to the bad side as veteran IMF agent Jim Phelps (the only character to return from the original TV Series.) Voight adds class and experience to the cast and he's absolutely villainous as Phelps and although he's really no match for Hunt who he's trained perhaps too well his character is perfect as is he in the role. Emmanuelle Béart is as close to a leading lady as the film has. Mission Impossible kind of has a stigma almost like a ""Bond Girl"" with each film and Béart is the Mission Impossible girl for this installment, Claire Phelps (wife/""widow"" of Jim Phelps.) She does a decent job but the chemistry is slightly lacking between her and Cruise and she never really gets a big character development, she's just kind of there but she does alright. Becoming one of my favorite supporting character actors is french actor Jean Reno who plays bad guy Franz Krieger. I prefer him in hero roles but his bad guy is equally good although he's kind of the henchman of the film and is doomed from the beginning. He still adds to the cast a great deal. Ving Rhames plays disavowed agent Luther Stickell in a role which turns into a long lasting partnership between Luther and Ethan. His role is slightly small but they probably keep it small so as to not overshadow Cruise's character because Rhames can be a big screen presence in his own right. Also noteworthy is MULTI talented and MULTI Oscar nominated (one win) actress Vanessa Redgrave who plays ""Max."" She deliciously mysterious and bad all at once and the sexual chemistry and banter between her and Cruise is overwhelming and very witty. She definitely adds some class to the film.Now I will admit to something because I've heard many other people mention this as well, since seeing Mission Impossible over ten years ago and several times since the plot has confused me since day one!! It was only this most recent viewing that I finally understood it. I suppose it's not overly complex but they really don't go into a lot of detail and explain it out. But the film has always been incredible because of it's action sequences and characters which really gives the film a lot of kudos. It's absolutely worth seeing and worth seeing again until you do understand it. I think it could have been simplified but for what it is, it's great and it will be if not already an absolute classic. Ethan Hunt's daring theft of a top secret agent list as he dangles above an incredibly high security room, the edge of your seat chase aboard a high speed train, and OF COURSE...the unmistakable thumping beat of the Mission Impossible song which is used three times in the film and every time absolutely gets your blood pumping!! If you want an unmistakable incredible action film this is it!!! 9/10",Mission - Impossible
43,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A suspenseful spy thriller that started one of the best film franchises of all time.,8,29 July 2018,"'Mission: Impossible (1996)' favours meticulously set-up, supremely suspenseful espionage over balls-to-the-wall action but still delivers delirious amounts of both in its brilliant set-pieces. These are each as unique and thrilling as the last, present only as extensions to an intriguing and involving narrative that rarely, if ever, makes a mistake and constantly keeps you on the edge of your seat. While I can see why fans of the original and revival series may have been upset with the handling of the only returning character, I feel as though the filmmakers made a ballsy decision in their adaptation and ultimately created a piece faithful to the spirit and tone of the show. The movie is extremely entertaining, a more meticulous and perhaps subtle 'action film' than usual (indeed, our hero refreshingly never even fires a gun). You just have to strap in and enjoy the ride while never even thinking about 'turning your brain off' - perhaps it is those that did that found the movie 'confusing'. If you're willing, you'll experience an incredibly exciting picture that launched one of the best film franchises of all time. 8/10",Mission - Impossible
44,g-bodyl,I Wanted More!,8,21 December 2008,"Mission:Impossible is not a bad film if you look at this movie as a whole. If you break it down into pieces, negative things about this movie will unravel. This film is based off the original television series from the 60's. Basically the main character, Ethan Hunt's team was killed and is being targeted as a suspect. He must seek help from other agents to stop him from being targeted. Most of the acting is fairly decent. Tom Cruise was annoying from time to time. Jon Voight and Ving Rhames were the best. The special effects are great, but so are other special-effects movies from the 90's such as Godzilla. I had a few problems with this film. Some of the scenes were boring and pointless. There is hardly any action, just talk. If you want action, I recommend James Bond. This is nothing like the original series, but this film is good to watch and compare anyway. Based of this review, I should have rated this movie 5/10 but I give it a 7/10 due to Rhames/Voight and the special effects.",Mission - Impossible
45,cricketbat,"The technology is dated, but the thrills aren't",9,26 January 2019,"The technology may be dated in Mission: Impossible, but the thrills aren't. This is a solid espionage movie with unforgettable sequences and plenty of twists. Yes, the plot is a little overly complicated, but there's a reason this film created an entire franchise: it's highly entertaining to see Ethan Hunt and his team take on a seemingly impossible mission.",Mission - Impossible
46,lesleyharris30,"The Beginning of a Great Film Series,",7,15 February 2013,"Mission: Impossible is a great movie with a well developed plot and a great cast. There is plenty of action that will keep you interested from start to finish, and it is at times very intense as well.Tom Cruise delivers a fantastic performance as Ethan Hunt, and it's no surprise he's still playing him today. It's a great franchise and Cruise suits the character.The movie definitely has its flaws, I think the story can be a bit convoluted at times, the plot definitely had moments were it felt like it was all over the place. It felt as if the writers had so much to handle with the source material that they were trying, maybe a little too hard, to make a movie that is bigger than every episode of the television series.As well as that, all of the characters bar Ethan are underdeveloped. We really learn nothing about anyone else, which makes it difficult for us to care for or support them when they are immensely two dimensional. It is simple, mindless fun that leads to better movies. Mission Impossible is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good action or thriller.Ethan Hunt is framed for disloyalty of his organisation, he now must try and prove his innocence and that he is not a traitor to the US.Best Performance: Tom Cruise",Mission - Impossible
47,secondtake,More effect and affect than a great plot--you won't care about much but it's fun,6,4 February 2013,"Mission: Impossible (1996)The is a taste thing, but I found this movie playing so hard with movie tricks and spy clichés it became weirdly slow at times and weirdly irrelevant. You might say I wasn't supposed to much care about the characters in the twisting plot, but that's like saying they didn't really ""intend"" to make a great movie, so get over it.I didn't hate this by any means, I just expected more. I think I liked the third MI movie just because it took that ridiculous, high adventure stuff further. That said, there are totally fun and purposely outrageous scenes that almost make the rest of it worthwhile. Mainly, for me, the insane helicopter train chase. Ha. I laughed and had a good time with that.For those who know the MI movies this review is meant to raise the question--what is a movie like this supposed to achieve in the viewer? And how does it compare to the best of, to be obvious, the James Bond movies (I just saw ""Skyfall,"" which for all its own flaws was better)? Or does it hold a candle to the really good Jason Bourne movies? (Not really, though the Bourne movies take themselves so so seriously, they occupy a different zone. James Bond always had a kind of detached humor which works well.)Brian DePalma is a director who knows most of all how to achieve effects. In this way the movie is wonderful--the angles for some simple confrontations, the changing camera angles throughout. His movies always replace substance with style, for sure, and yet the style is so overt and so attractive it almost becomes the substance. You can watch a DePalma movie just with your eyes.I'll admit once last problem I have here--I don't think much of Tom Cruise. He's a plastic caricature. He's not a bad actor, I suppose, but he lacks some kind of intensity or style or something (I'm think Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt, or even Matt Damon for some kind of ""persona"" at work). He's a big part of the movie.My favorite actor/actress in this whole thing is the remarkable Kristin Scott Thomas, and she's in it for just a few minutes. Jon Voigt is always welcome, and does his job. Vanessa Redgrave frankly over does her part, but that's part of the DePalma excess. Fun stuff.In the end, fine, another scene where the weary survivors of an adventure sit and soak up normal cafe life. Take it as it comes. Not half bad, not half good.",Mission - Impossible
48,CuriosityKilledShawn,Not really THAT confusing,7,7 May 2006,"I first saw Mission: Impossible when I was 15 and I didn't have a Scooby what the hell was going on. And I considered myself to be smarter than the average bear. In retrospect, it's not that muddled. In comparison to the very-dumbed down sequel it stands out as a better example of film-making made by a director who doesn't underestimate the audience.Brian De Palma is known to be a wildly inconsistent filmmaker. From the over-rated Carrie, to the under-rated Snake Eyes, the classic Untouchables and the downright hideous Mission to Mars and Scarface, he's been through just about everything. But Mission: Impossible was his first true mega-hit. Movies from TV shows are a dime a dozen these days and are rarely taken seriously, I mean look at trash like S.W.A.T. or Dukes of Hazard, but M:I is actually supposed to be a continuation of the show, rather than a spin-off.Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt (no, not cockney rhyming slang) an IMF agent who's entire team is killed in a phony sting operation in Prague. Accused of being a traitor he legs it before they can nab him and assembles a team of rogue operatives to find out who the REAL traitor is. Many double-crosses and double-double crosses ensue.For those who cannot follow the plot there are some really good set-pieces with enough tension and excitement to carry the whole movie. You'll know by now the dangling scene in the top-secret room but the best scene in the movie is the high-speed train rocketing through the English countryside. While other directors might use this as a chance to show off, De Palma keeps it as realistic as possible which makes it infinitely more cooler.Parts of the movie may seem a bit dated now and it's weird seeing Tom Cruise look like a little boy even though he was already 33. He even sounds different. And what kind of supervillian uses floppy discs? They could have tried something a bit more high-tech there.The M:I franchise could be a helluva lot better, I suppose. The second film was terrible and the third merely average. But they're still better than the last few Bond outings, though it ain't quite up to the rugged quality of the Jason Bourne movies.At least it got off to a good start. But can the world tolerate Cruise long enough to ever get a fourth made?",Mission - Impossible

50,callanvass,"As good as a spy thriller can get,a real thrill ride to say the least!.",8,25 December 2009,"Mission Impossible was a film that I initially didn't care for,during my 1st few viewings. But the latest viewing,it seems I finally got it. Mission Impossible is a film that you have to pay strict attention too,otherwise you will eventually get lost,as it's a very confusing film. It isn't action packed like the sequels are,it's more of a mystery type thriller,but it has plenty of suspense,plenty of surprises,with an explosive finale that will have you on the edge of your seat!. I especially liked the train sequence at the end,it was very well done. I thought the casting of Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt was a bit strange at 1st. Now I am a huge Cruise fan,but he just didn't seem like the Action hero type. He proved me wrong big time,and did what he did best,put on a captivating show,his charisma is a big reason this film worked. The big twist at the end is shocking to say the least. Some would say it didn't make much sense,I personally thought it was a nice touch,because the film needed to end with a big bang,and I thought it did just that!.Mission Impossible isn't as flashy or action packed as the sequels,but as far as i'm concerned it may very well be the best in the series.Performances. Tom Cruise has proved to be one of Hollywood's most charismatic and reliable actors for what seems like forever. Here he does not disappoint. He makes a great Ethah Hunt,he's witty,he oozes charisma,adding the perfect balance of charm&likability to Ethan. He handles himself well in the action scenes too,as I said he was a big reason in making this film work,with his undeniable charisma. Jon Voight is a hell of a presence. He always adds class and excellent acting to any film he's in,here was no different. Emmanuelle Béart is certainly a beauty,but she can also act pretty good too. She was highly mysterious,it kept her character unpredictable. Henry Czerny is full of intensity. His banter with Cruise in the restaurant was chilling stuff,I loved the guy!. Jean Reno is OK here. He is a capable actor,but I didn't much care for him in this. Ving Rhames is a pure bad ass,and while his role isn't as big as in the next two,he still came through. Rest of the cast do fine.Bottom Line. Mission Impossible is an excellent spy thriller. It's exciting,suspenseful and downright unpredictable. Highly recommend,if you choose to accept this Mission.8 1/2 /10",Mission - Impossible
51,Bored_Dragon,007 Wannabe ...,6,10 December 2016,"It is quite probable that my objectivity is not on the level as I do not like either De Palma or Cruise. In my opinion, this is typical Hollywood crap, Tom Cruise trying to live his boyhood dream of being new 007. Unsuccessfully... The plot is kind of mannered and all twists and turns are predictable so the story wasn't interesting to me and there is no trace of tension or surprise factor. Music pretty much irritating, directing does not stand out, and acting... I don't know, maybe it is aversion towards Cruise talking, but I am incapable to see any of his characters. In his every movie I always see just same old featureless vacuous Tom Cruise. He had few decent movies back in ""Top Gun"" time, but ever since... The only movie he did good (but still not great) job was ""Interview With a Vampire"". And the only De Palma's movie I really appreciate is ""Carlito's Way"". All in all, I wouldn't recommend this even to action fans, because even within the action genre it is not above average.6/10",Mission - Impossible

It's a good thing Peter Graves was alive when this came out, or he would have been turning over in his grave at the treatment of his character from the beloved TV show. The script is by turns confusing and dull. An early action sequence where the team tries to do something to somebody at a party at a mansion is very clumsily executed by De Palma. A later sequence at the CIA headquarters comes off a little better but is quite far-fetched. The most ludicrous, however, is the final action sequence aboard a moving train. The cast is stellar, but only Redgrave turns in a noteworthy performance.",Mission - Impossible
53,The-Sarkologist,Let's make a movie where somebody flies a helicopter into the Channel Tunnel,4,14 October 2013,"First this movie is a remake of an old series, and secondly it has Tom Cruise in it. Tom Cruise is not a bad actor, it just annoys me that movie is focused completely around him, as if he were God. No wonder the Germans hated this movie. Anyway I will give away the plot in this movie because I feel that you really don't need to see it. The only reason I taped it and watched it was because Jean Reno was in it, and he is quite a good actor.Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt, the member of the IMF team that performs impossible missions. During a routine mission everything goes wrong, and only Hunt and the wife of Jim Phelps (the leader of the team) escape. The American government believe that Hunt is behind it, and is a mole selling out to the enemy, so order him arrested, but he manages to slip through their fingers, and even breaks into CIA headquarters at Langley, Virginia. It ends up that Jim Phelps is the mole and that Jean Reno is the agent who is in it for the money. The movie ends in a scene in the English Channel tunnel, where Reno flies a helicopter through it and Hunt tackles Phelps on the back of a train.This movie follows the theme of the end of the cold war and thus the intelligence agencies are no longer needed. This is not an action packed movie, but tries to follow the tenseness of the original series. It is more about people trying to get into places which are very difficult to get into it. As such it follows the style of Sneakers, which I believe is a far superior movie.",Mission - Impossible

There has been countless attempts at bringing old TV shows to the big screen with little success. Mission Impossible delivers on every level. I think it's a great movie, which I'm surprised I don't watch more often. It's not meant to be taken 100% serious, it's a fun summer popcorn flick. It has some decent twists, some good stunts and all the performances are decent too. Cruise looks cool and does cool stunts!! It's always good to see Jon Voight, I love Jean Reno, Emmanuelle Bèart is gorgeous and we get a neat cameo from Cruises old Outsiders costar Emilio Estevez. People complain about it not being very plausible and the movie falls apart if you think too much about it, I say ignore such people, and just enjoy the movies. Mission Impossible grossed $180 million at the domestic box office (a personal best for Cruise) to end the year the 3rd highest grossing movie of 1996.",Mission - Impossible
55,tomgillespie2002,"Only really has its momentum, so best to strap in and go with it",6,29 July 2018,"It's hard to believe that Brian De Palma's Mission: Impossible is now 22 years old. What's even harder to believe is the fact that this franchise is still going, and stronger than ever, with the sixth entry into the series, Mission: Impossible: Fallout, about to be released this very week. Despite some wobbles since, the series got off to a very strong start in the hands of De Palma who, while pissing off a few hardcore fans of the original television show with some bold character decisions, delivered a thriller that really set the heart racing. It's also aged incredibly well. While the gizmos now seem somewhat dated (the McGuffin is a floppy disk), there was always an old-fashioned broodiness about the film that has given it a timeless quality. Of course, it's all just an excuse to make Tom Cruise run, and run he certainly does.Jim Phelps (Jon Voight) and his Impossible Mission Force (IMF) are on a mission in Prague to retrieve a list of secret agents' real identities. The mission goes awry, with most of the team (which also consists of Emmanuelle Beart, Kristin Scott Thomas and Emilio Estevez) winding up dead, leaving only Ethan Hunt (Cruise) to figure out what the hell just happened. With Hunt the only survivor, IMF director Kittridge (Henry Czerny) suspects him to be the mole within the agency he has been trying to smoke out for years. Hunt flees to try and uncover the mole himself, finding a lead in the mysterious Max, a contact the mole had been communicating with using passages from the Bible. Finding himself disavowed by the government and without a team to help him, Hunt starts recruiting, finding a brand new team in fellow disavowed agents Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Franz Krieger (Jean Reno). Their first mission is to break into the CIA headquarters in Langley and steal back the list, in the hope of finding the rat and proving Hunt's innocence.There are three key set-pieces in Mission: Impossible that perhaps no other director is better suited for. De Palma is the master of long, tension-building moments of suspense, and Hunt's infiltration of the CIA is an iconic moment for good reason. He must enter into a room from above, copy a file while dangling from a wire, and exit within a set time. Any noise above a certain decibel level will trigger an alarm and cause a total lockdown, as will any additional weight on the floor. Filmed in complete silence, it's a masterfully choreographed sequence. As a trickle of sweat makes its way to the rim of Hunt's glasses, you won't exhale until it's all over. De Palma is better known for leaning of Hitchcockian influences, but his approach here is more Jules Dassin. There are other exciting moments too, and thank God, as the plot is about as baffling as its lead stars affiliation with Scientology. The thrills also distract from some pacing issues, which normally arise when Hunt is left to mope around in a hotel room, and some revelations you can see coming from a mile off (the shifty, knife-wielding Frenchman is a baddie, really?). Mission: Impossible really only has its momentum, so it's best just to strap in and go with it.",Mission - Impossible

58,cruise01,Slow and a dull direction but does set up for a franchise for Tom Cruise.,6,13 July 2018,"Mission Impossible (3 out of 5 stars).Mission Impossible is a decent action spy film. Yes, it is a great start for a franchise based on a tv series. I did find this film to be quite boring and slow at times. The plot was all over the place and had a couple of twists that is not surprising. It had a couple of action sequences like an infiltration scene were Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is dangling from the ceiling in a high security room. And the climatic bullet train scene were Tom Cruise is chasing the bad guy on top of the train. Which can be breathtaking. But otherwise, the film suffers from poor editing and pacing issues. The plot follows Ethan Hunt trying to find a mole in his team. After his team's mission was sabotaged and wiped out. He spends most of the movie in a safe room, looking at books, and trying to find traces of were the money that was setting him up. There is a couple of twists were good guys turned bad. Or bad guys turned good. It just suffered from poor pacing. There are a couple of action sequences. The climatic scene was the only exciting part of the movie. But it does take a long way to get there. Director Brian De Palma could have done the film a bit better. The characters were undeveloped. Jean Reno, Emmanuelle Beart, Henry Czerny, Ving Rhames, and Jon Voight could have all stuck out. But there characters were all flat. Tom Cruise was good playing the IMF agent. Overall, Mission Impossible is a fair film. It only had one exciting action sequence. The plot was dull and boring about them trying to find a mole in their agency and spend most of it in one room, the characters were forgettable, and Tom Cruise was the only good thing about the movie.",Mission - Impossible

60,helpless_dancer,It did not live up to its potential,5,16 December 1998,"I gotta say I was disappointed with this one. Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors and he did a good job in this movie, but the story wasn't there for me. As is the usual with me, and this may be the whole thing in a nutshell, I didn't understand what was going on. I never seem to ""get"" the storyline in these spy against spy films.

That hurt!",Mission - Impossible
61,Anonymous_Maxine,It's too bad the sequel sucked,9,2 April 2001,"Mission: Impossible is a great action film. Tom Cruise delivers a great performance as the famous Ethan Hunt, and the technological toys that he has in this film rival many of the toys seen in the James Bond films, very few of which are as good as this film. The story is very interesting, but is also hard to follow at some points. However, the end of the film actually goes back to recap what has happened, pointing out some things that you were almost guaranteed to have missed on the first viewing, and this retelling is flawlessly worked into the movie, so it's not like being told all over again what you have already seen. What makes this movie so good is that the mystery is so well presented, and all of the performances are very good. It's true that a lot of the situations were fairly unrealistic (I don't think I even need to mention the fact that it is physically impossible to fly a helicopter in a tunnel), but the quality of the rest of the film more than makes up for these shortcomings. At least the movie wasn't manipulative. It's not excessively gory, there isn't unnecessary violence, there's no goofball romance, and the twists and turns are unexpected and very effective. And, most importantly, there is a brilliantly written script, with endlessly amusing lines like, `I want him manning a radar tower in Alaska by the end of the day, just mail him his clothes.' Why can't there be more movies with cool lines like that? James Bond sure as hell never uttered anything that clever.Some of the action sequences in Mission: Impossible have become famous, such as the nail-biting break-in scene where Hunt is hanging over the glowing floor in the room protected by the world's greatest alarm system, as well as the less effective helicopter tunnel scene. As a whole, this is a very high quality action film. It does have a few problems, but the rest of the film is so good that you are able to easily overlook them.",Mission - Impossible

Start watching. The very first Mission Impossible is the very best. It was explosive when it first came out. It is rock solid decades later. A new classic. Timeless. One of Brian de Palma's best. One of Tom Cruise's best ever. Perfect from beginning to end.",Mission - Impossible
63,Vartiainen,Earns its reputation,6,4 November 2012,"Mission Impossible is one of those movies pretty much everyone knows, along with Dirty Harry, Die Hard and the like. And rightfully so, as it is a very solid action piece with memorable scenes, interesting plot twists and masterfully recycled classics and clichés. It's one of those movies that define a genre, in this case an action/heist genre.Of the listed good qualities, I'd definitely pick the memorable scenes as the one thing that keeps this film in people's minds. This film is full of iconic scenes that have been remade, praised and parodied ever since. From the hanging computer heist to the chase sequence on top of the train, I'd say that if you haven't seen the original, you've probably seen many of its scenes in slightly different variations in other films. They're that good. Other memorable and well-done things include the score, obviously, and the story that's not terribly original or new, but which has been given a different spin to make it feel like it's original and new.On the downside, the characters aren't very good, in my honest opinion. The actors playing them are terrific, even though I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise, but they're not given much to work with. The main character Ethan Hunt especially just doesn't have that larger than life quality that John McClane and Harry Callahan have in abundance. He's not a bad character, none of them are, he's just not very memorable. He's a set piece, there to move the plot along, more than anything.It's still very watchable movie, but not on my personal list of the top action films of all time. Still, every fan of action movies has seen it at least once, which is pretty much the highest compliment that you can pay to a movie, and it has earned that compliment.",Mission - Impossible
64,FiendishDramaturgy,"Entertaining, slick endeavor.",8,17 January 2005,"DePalma's all about lighting, camera angles, the perfect details for the perfect scene. All this makes for a much better finished product, and helps set the mood and pacing of the story. The story for this enterprise centers around Tom Cruise and his character, Ethan Hunt. When his mission goes awry, the frame begins to tighten. Everywhere he turns, everyone around Ethan seems to be on the ""other"" side, or operating in a duplicitous manner. It's up to our hero to fit together the pieces of this mental puzzle and figure out ""who dunnit?""An interesting (if unoriginal) plot which plays out well beneath DePalma's direction and Cruise's performance abilities.I'm not a fan of Cruise. I personally don't like him very much. I've never cared for the way he comes off as feeling superior. But I do have to admit that he's done few movies that I haven't liked. He is a talent unto himself, and as over-rated as he may appear to be, I think he's earned those ratings by delivering quality entertainment through quality performances.Nice action, good level of suspense, interesting characters, and a flexible yet solid plot.A very entertaining (if unremarkable), slick endeavor.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",Mission - Impossible
65,elshikh4,We All Know That It's about Nothing But 2 Memorable Sequences !,5,11 August 2007,"""The problem of this movie is that (Brian De Palma) razed the very main theme which the whole series was based on; and I mean the idea of the team's spirit, or the real unity of those gifted genius agents who were all killed by him at the beginning of the film in cold blood to make their superior, the old dearly loved character, as the low killer and the actual traitor!Moreover, it took us a very long time of waiting to have a Mission Impossible movie. And when that finally happened, we found out that the popular show was transformed into the last thing you could ever expect; a paranoia about the intelligence's men after the end of the cold war!And you know what? Maybe (Tom Cruise) will love it, and consider it his ticket to the world of big loud action movies, that got sequels every summer like (Lethal Weapon) or (Die Hard)! So it'll not be (Mission Impossible) any more; it'll become (Mission for Tom Crouse), or (The Adventures of The Short American Brother of James Bond)!!""That was my unpublished comment about the movie, right after watching it for the very first time in 1996 (I found it lately in forgotten papers of mine). And it said it all for sure, especially when you read it in 2007, after two sequels already, and more destruction for the original lovable (MI) which was a landmark in the TV history.As for the movie, we all know that it's about nothing but 2 memorable sequences; a thrilling heist one, and another so Hollywood action one. Because aside from them, there was no understandable plot. Even with so deep concentration, there isn't much to catch on. It's a movie about spies, which looks attractive and respectable, but surely not that interesting, intelligible or funny. It is Bond, however taking itself so-over-the-top seriously, where it mustn't. Imagine double-crossed, too earnest, and avenger Bond, played by poor (Tom Cruise) under the name, ONLY the name, of Mission Impossible TV show.. Just Grrrr!Hence, that was Mission Impossible without The Mission Impossible usual. A smart thriller that didn't show some smart plot. A movie with unconvincing lead. And despite being partly watchable, this is naturally a shock for the TV show fans.Wanna explain everything? I'll do it in one line: Cruise is the producer of all the three MI movies to date. And simply the man wanted some space to make his own action blockbusters, NOT a movie with 5 stars about team of 5 agents. However, something in you must scream angrily that he just picked the wrong origin to mess with; where the main wrong happened to the show!ANYHOW. It's a *different formula* this time, which differs from big part of what the famous title tells, or used to tell. So if you want its artistic thriller: then this movie is for you. If you want its downright absurd action: it's part 2. And if you want the best of the previous 2 movies; then it's part 3 for you, which is their more perfect, less far from the original TV show.",Mission - Impossible

And Cruise instead of Redford, which actually is a pretty even swap from one generation to another...only Redford is still the better actor and Cruise only really acts when he wants to.So, yeah, if you saw 3 Days of the Condor you know what is going on.

The plot is a bit too twisty-turny for its own good, with perhaps ninety percent of the cast switching allegiances at least once before it's through, but that's kind of its thing and I can write off a few eccentricities in the name of identity. Jean Reno and Ving Rhames are wasted as generic lackeys, though, and the vital makeup effects aren't nearly as good as I had remembered. The magic of watching a guy rip off a faceful of fake skin is sort of lost when I can immediately identify who's wearing it as soon as they step on-screen. Though campy at times, it's still worth a watch for the perfect, trendsetting blend of action and suspense it brings to several key moments.",Mission - Impossible
69,alindsay-al,A very solid spy thriller,7,30 September 2014,"Mission Impossible has become well known for its theme song and also for this being Tom Cruise's franchise, but this film is a really solid spy thriller and it does a really good job of introducing this franchise. This story starts off when special agent Ethan Hunt ends up with his team all dead on a mission and he is accused of conspiracy against the American government and on the run for his life. Now this really is Tom Cruise's film and he is fantastic as Ethan Hunt and does a really good job of being a serious action star who the audience can relate too which really brings out the best in the film. The supporting cast is pretty poor though really, an exception to that is Jon Voight as Jim Phelps, even though it is a bit of a smaller role he does a great job in the role and alongside Cruise he does a great job. But then to the rest it is not my favourite, the woman they got to play Jim Phelps wife Claire isn't a very good actress and she doesn't do a very good job in the role. Also the guy they got to play the head of the CIA would have been better had he had a bigger role as he wasn't given enough time to establish his character. Jean Reno also plays another fugitive and I didn't really like his character either as he just seemed like a weird add on that wasn't really necessary. The story is a huge plus with loads of twists and turns that make all the characters add to the story and make them seemingly important. The script is okay with Cruise having some really good lines but some of the other characters lines are not that good at all. The style of the film is great with obviously the iconic theme song being great but also the action scenes seemed realistic but also exciting. This is a really good solid film that I hope sees even better in the future.",Mission - Impossible
70,MaxBorg89,Stylish TV remake.,8,4 May 2006,"After Carlito's Way, all of Brian De Palma's movies have been more about style than content. When the plot and characters weren't good enough to keep the film interesting, we got crap like Femme Fatale. When, on the other hand, De Palma had an intelligent script and a reliable cast to work with, the result was quite pleasant. Mission:Impossible belongs to the second category.Based on the popular TV show from the '60s, the movie starts with Jim Phelps (Jon Voight), leader of IMF (Impossible Mission Force), preventing the latest terrorist plot before receiving a new assignment (""This message will self-destruct in five seconds""): he has to locate and arrest a double agent. The problem is, his whole team, including himself, gets wiped out during the mission. Only Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is left, which brings his superiors to a ""logical"" conclusion: he has to be the traitor. Alone and on the run, Hunt has to prove his innocence and find the real dirty agent. He will receive some help from Claire (Emmanuelle Bèart), Jim's wife, computer whiz Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and mercenary Krieger (Jean Reno). An impossible mission? Perhaps...As I already said, this film relies heavily on style, and De Palma artfully delivers when it comes to staging an exciting thriller. Two scenes in particular prove the Scarface director was the right man for the job. One sees Ethan trying to rob a maximum security vault whose alarm basically reacts even if you have to scratch your nose. That scene is loaded with suspense and is one of the best ever directed by De Palma. The other memorable bit is the final set piece (I'll just say three words: train, tunnel, chopper), which proves things can really get impossible in these movies.As for content, David Koepp's script is brilliant as long as it deals with the various conspiracies, but rather shallow in terms of character development. Take the IMF team at the beginning: they're so hastily introduced it's hard to feel for them when they're all killed five minutes later. Apart from Cruise, who manages to turn an otherwise one-dimensional protagonist into a charismatic lead, the only characters worth watching are Phelps (a superb Voight) and Max, a criminal mastermind, masterfully underplayed by Vanessa Redgrave.All in all, not as good as De Palma's earlier works, but nonetheless quite stylish, charming and enjoyable, not to mention a really good adaptation of a TV series. If only other remakes (Charlie's Angels, for example) were this good.",Mission - Impossible
71,Fluke_Skywalker,Mission (more or less) accomplished,7,26 March 2019,"Plot; Agent Ethan Hunt is framed and must fight to both clear his name and discover the actual culprit before they can sell a list containing sensitive information.The M:I franchise is an odd one. W/gaps of 4, 6, 5 and 4 years, it lacked any kind of set release schedule typically associated w/blockbuster franchises. And bouncing between wildly different directors, it also struggled to find a consistent tone. But for the most part they entertained and found enough success to warrant another. When director Christopher McQuarrie came on board for the series' fifth entry, the franchise once again bucked franchise convention by hitting its stride. Today, 6 films and 23 years later, the Mission: Impossible film series is more popular than ever. Having enjoyed the most recent entry, Fallout, this past Summer, I've had an itch to go back and revisit the original as a sort of compare and contrast. And contrast they do. Wildly so. I wasn't surprised by this, but that contrast wasn't exactly the type of contrast I was expecting.M:I isn't really an action movie. At least not in the conventional sense, and certainly not in the mold of Fallout. Aside from its explosive finale, there's nothing here that I'd call an action scene. At least not in the ""Bang! Bang! Zoom! Zoom!"" sense. It's more of a thriller than an action movie. And like many such films from its era, it carries a whiff of Cold War zeitgeist even as it acknowledges its end. But other than that and its amusingly outdated tech, it's not as ""90s"" as I thought. I was expecting it to be more 90s than Bill Clinton watching Friends and drinking a Crystal Pepsi while wearing a Lollapalooza t-shirt at Beavis and Butthead's house, but it's actually got a more timeless feel.Just as the series struggled to find a tone and style, so too has Cruise (and the writers) failed to give Ethan Hunt a definable personality or set of characteristics (beyond, perhaps, a dogged determination). Bond's personality has varied wildly over the years depending on the era and the actor, but he's had a basic set of traits and tropes to help ground him. Hunt has none of those things. Even as the last two films began to give some shape to the series, I can't give you even a thumbnail of who Ethan Hunt is. That's not to say Cruise is bad. In fact, he's quite good. Whatever limitations and range Cruise may have, he has undeniable star power, and it's an asset here. He's surrounded by a uniformly strong cast, w/Jon Voigt (though sadly not his car *90s reference*), Vanessa Redgrave, Jean Reno, Henry Czerny and series regular Ving Rhames doing top work. Redgrave and Czerny in particular are fun to watch, and I wish they'd been brought back in future entries.In juxtaposition to Fallout, this first M:I movie is a tad slow, even though it clocks in at under 2 hours to Fallout's near 2 and a half hour runtime, but taken on its own merits it's a well made popcorn thriller w/just enough twists and turns to satisfy.",Mission - Impossible

75,gcd70,Action the order of the day,7,26 March 2008,"Action is the order of the day when remaking a t.v. smash hit like the ever popular ""Mission : Impossible"". With this in mind, top line scripters David Koepp, Steven Zaillian and Robert Towne, along with director Brian DePalma, have produced a film complimented with tense, nerve racking scenes and adrenalin pumping action, while the f/x pros supply all the hi-tech gadgetry synonymous with ""the team"".Tom Cruise, star and co-producer this time, is Ethan Hawke, hot shot point man for Jim Phelps' elite band of covert operatives who undertake those deadly, imperative top secret missions that no-one else can handle. When the team is ambushed and Hawke comes out unscathed, he is immediately suspect and must prove himself innocent of the charge of betrayal, all the while avoiding capture. This catalyst sets the film going as Ethan finds a couple of sympathisers in the disavowed Krieger and Luther. With their help Hawke begins to put the pieces of the puzzle together, and starts to uncover the identity of the real mole.Whole cast are thoroughly enjoyable, with Cruise leading the way, supported by the lovely Emmanuelle Beart, the increasingly entertaining duo of Jean Reno (""Krieger"") and Ving Rhames (""Luther""), and Jon Voight as group leader Jim Phelps. There are a couple of surprise cameos too, form the likes of Kristin Scott-Thomas and Vanessa Redgrave. Obviously it's the look, the pace and the seemingly complex plot that really make the film however.Cinematography, art and sets are all eye catching as the action jumps from one continent to another and back again. Special effects crew (the amazing ILM) save their best for last in the mind blowing finale, set in the London to Paris rail tunnel. Editing keeps the tempo nicely upbeat, while the groovy original theme (Lalo Schifrin) and new music (Danny Elfman) provide fantastic backing.The most effective piece of film making has come from director DePalma and his screenwriters. In presenting the storyline very patchily, it appears to have more depth and intrigue than is the case. The plot presentation is so vague in fact that many viewers have complained about being unable to follow the narrative. In truth, the basic premise and outlay are very simple, yet elusive in detail, thus gaining maximum points from audiences seeking a twisting, winding tale. Careful scrutiny and a little analytical after thought will dissolve the mystery and help you understand what went on.Not quite a master stroke, but ""Mission : Impossible"" is a flash of genius in the making of an action/thriller form the multi-talented, hit and miss Brian DePalma. Tom Cruise fans, you're in for a treat!Wednesday, July 24, 1996 - Knox District CentreDe Palma's sharply twisting action pic features an expertly arranged screenplay which milks maximum effect from the deceptively complex story.

76,ShootingShark,"This Movie, Should You Decide To Watch It, Is A Pretty Good Spy Thriller",6,19 September 2009,"Ethan Hunt is a covert CIA operative on a secret mission in Prague to retrieve a stolen list of agents' details, when the job goes horribly wrong and all his team are wiped out. With his bosses thinking he's a mole behind the botched operation, he must somehow prove his innocence and find out what really happened.Based on the old TV spy show by Bruce Geller, this is an enjoyable, handsomely made thriller with a strong cast, exciting locations, some great action scenes and an intriguing if rather familiar premise. What lets it down a bit for me is the script, by David Koepp and Robert Towne. The key thing with this kind of material I reckon is when to reveal who the traitor is. If you do it at the end you have to pad it out. If you do it in the middle - as this does - it can sometimes work very well (Vertigo, L.A. Confidential) but it needs to be very clear and simple. The liability scene is the one where Cruise and Voight go over the failed mission and we're bamboozled by the flashbacks which accompany it - are they Cruise imagining what may have happened, or Voight remembering what did transpire ? The plot has other holes - when do Czerny and Cruise team up ? Is it a coincidence that Reno works for both Cruise and Voight ? Is money really the only rationale for Voight's actions (he's reprising the character Peter Graves played in the TV show, but seems to have had a seismic personality shift in the interim). This is weak scripting, designed to set up big surprise scenes, but which winds up just being confusing. That said however, just about every other aspect of the picture is first rate, and there are at least three cracking suspense sequences of the kind DePalma does so well (the massacre on the banks of the Vltava, the heist at CIA headquarters and the finale on the TGV train). Danny Elfman's music is great and makes inspired use of Lalo Schifrin's much loved theme tune, while Stephen H. Burum's location photography of Prague and London is sensational, a sort of Funeral In Berlin meets To Catch A Thief. Cruise is good in the lead (under some wild makeup work by Rob Bottin), with great sneaky support from heavy hitters like Voight, Reno and Rhames, although the women are kinda dull; Béart is a bit of a cipher, Scott Thomas gets knocked off quickly, and Redgrave is fun but extremely unlikely as some sort of Euro black marketeer dealer. This isn't DePalma's (or even Cruise's) best film by some margin, but it's an entertaining, if occasionally annoying, contemporary action spy thriller. Trivia - Estevez as the gadgetry man is unbilled for some reason; he and Cruise first appeared together in Francis Coppola's The Outsiders thirteen years earlier.",Mission - Impossible
77,rbverhoef,Better than most action thrillers,7,2 July 2003,"'Mission: Impossible' is sort of like an entertaining 'movie: impossible'. To understand the plot completely and to really believe the things we see on the screen are pretty impossible, but it does deliver what it promises. I was able to put the confusing parts aside and enjoy this well made action thriller.The movie starts in Prague with a team of agents on a secret mission that includes Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), Jack (Emilio Estevez), Sarah (Kristin Scott Thomas), Claire (Emmanuelle Béart) and her husband and also leader Jim (Jon Voight). Things go terribly wrong and Ethan is the only one who survives the mission. He meets with his main superior named Kittridge (Henry Czerny) only to find out they were looking for a mole. Since he is the only survivor they think Ethan is the man they want. Of course he escapes and to find the real mole, or at least discover the truth, he contacts the person the mole was working for, codename: Max (he turns out to be a she with the face of Vanessa Redgrave). Since a lot of people are looking for Ethan he decides to help Max and deliver what she wanted from the original mole. He does this with the help of Claire, who survived after all, and two other men (Jean Reno and Ving Rhames) who used to work for the same organization as Ethan did.I guess what I have written above is true, but completely sure I am not. It is hard to complain though. The action is terrific and there are at least five singles scenes that could have been entire movies. To give you an example, Ethan has to retrieve something for Max from the CIA head quarters. Since he is a wanted man he has to steal it in a difficult way, of course. This turns 'Mission: Impossible' temporarily into a heist movie with events that could fill complete movies like 'Heist' or the terrific 'Ocean's Eleven'. The movie moves so fast that you can't even realize you don't get the plot entirely.Maybe in the end the movie has trouble to make the right choices but on the other hand it gives us the kind of action we want. Much better than the sequel 'Mission: Impossible' is a movie that delivers. Brian De Palma's direction makes sure we get what we want in a nice way.",Mission - Impossible
78,truemythmedia,A Unique Mission Impossible Film,8,15 June 2019,"""Mission: Impossible"" is one of the few franchises that has maintained my interest from beginning to current. I was the right age when the first one came out to actually buy it on VHS and watch enough times that it joins ""Hunt for Red October"" and ""Jurassic Park"" in that special category of movie that I can quote almost front to back.So, it will come as no surprise to anyone reading that I love this movie. Ethan Hunt is my James Bond. I've always looked forward to the new ones and I've seen them way more times. It certainly isn't flawless but it is a solid first run at rebooting a franchise. It kicked off Tom Cruise's producing career, is his landmark franchise, and one of the better ones out there.By today's standards ""Mission: Impossible"" is a bit slower that the other entries into the series. It is more of a psychological thriller or a spy noir. Sure it has amazing action set pieces, setting the bar for the rest of the franchise which would always be one-upping itself with each sequel, but the mystery of who betrayed Ethan is more like a good mystery than an action movie.The central theme of this film is not, how far can Ethan jump, how long can he hang, or quickly can he run. It's who can he trust and it is done in a way that is unique within the franchise. This movie still feels like a small film, not the tentpole series which grew from it.",Mission - Impossible
79,a_chinn,De Palma set pieces overcome an overcome an overly complicated plot and an annoying lead actor,8,29 May 2018,"This first Mission: Impossible film is a bit of a mixed bag for me. Firstly, Tom Cruise has always annoyed me as an actor, although I usually end up finding myself enjoying his films despite his annoying screen presence and weirdly intense performances. Second, This film's serpentine and overly complicated plot more than pushed credulity, not that your typical James Bond film is exactly realistic, but the plot here takes so many twists that it just becomes annoying. However, there are enough other aspect to the film that are so good the above mentioned fairly major deficits are overcome. The film opens with the IMF team (Jon Voight, Emmanuelle Béart, Kristin Scott Thomas, Ingeborga Dapkunaite, and Emilio Estevez) infiltrating a foreign embassy, when (SPOILER ALERT) the entire team is killed, which was a shockingly awesome the first time I saw it in the theater (especially after each character got their own freeze frame intro ALA TV credit sequence), with only Cruise and Béart barely escaping with their lives. The two then become prime suspects in their team's demise and then set out to clear their name by stealing the ""NOC List"" which contains all of the undercover IMF agents, which they will then use as leverage with another power broker so, blah, blah, blah... who really cares. The NOC List is a classic MacGuffin where it doesn't really matter what it is, except that all of the characters are after it. Cruise forms his own rogue team of disavowed agents, and I still remember the audible gasp of excitement from the audience in the theater with the reveal of Ving Rhames leaning into frame, followed by Jean Reno leaning in right after him. The two were not major stars at the time, but had both just come off of ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""The Professional,"" which is something that may be lost on audiences watching this film today. The main charm of this first Mission: Impossible film is the set pieces, which is something right up director Brian De Palma's alley. De Palma is famous for his elaborate set pieces, whether it's the baby carriage bouncing down the steps in the midsts of a slow motion shootout in ""The Untouchables,"" Angie Dickinson in ""Dressed to Kill"" following a man through an art gallery, John Travolta in ""Blow Out"" using a radio mic to find Nancy Allen before John Lithgow kills her, the long Steadicam setups for finale of ""Carlito's Way,"" or the wildly suspenseful build up to the pigs blood being dropped on Carrie at her prom, he is a director deservedly known as a modern day master of suspense and the rightful hair to Hitchcock's throne. De Palma delivers multiple set pieces, but the best comes in the middle of the film when the team breaks into the CIA headquarters, lasting almost 20 minutes, done almost wordlessly, and in near complete silence. The team breaks into a secure room at Langley that only one man has access to, is sound sensitive, the floors pressure sensitive, and are temperature sensitive, all of which can trigger an alarm, so the team has to get gain access, get the one agent out of the room, and bypass all the alarms in order to steal the NOC List. Will the agent come back into the room to discover Hunt? Will Hunt touch the floor and set off the alarm? Will the temperature in the room rise too high and set off the alarm? Will a noise set off the alarm? Will Reno be able to hold rope long enough to keep Hunt aloft? Will a rat in the air duct cause Reno to drop Hunt? Will that bead of sweat on Hunt's glasses touch the floor and set off the alarm? It's an insanely fun suspense set piece and is irresistible. The scene reminded me of the great Jules Dassin jewel heist pictures like ""Rififi"" or ""Topkapi,"" but with a dash of James Bond. The other scene that always stuck with me is a smaller one, but it's is also a testament to De Palma's directors skills. It's a scene following the film's opening when Cruise goes to a rrestaurant with the CIA director who wants to take Cruise in for questioning about his failed mission. De Palma slowly builds the suspense with increasing close ups of the two actors starring each other down as CIA head Eugene Kittridge, played by the underrated Henry Czerny, as he delivers the sharply written Robert Towne dialogue, over the crescendoing Danny Elman score, saying""Alright, Hunt. Enough is enough. You have bribed, cajoled and killed, and you have done it using loyalties on the inside, you want to shake hands with the devil, that's fine with me, I just want to make sure you do it in hell.""And then BOOM! Fish tanks explode and Elfman's music soars in what's another great De Palma build-up and climax. But De Palma films are much more than suspense. He's also known for his themes around voyeurism, violence, and guilt, as well as his many visual hallmarks, including split-screen, slow zooms, 360 degree shots, and extensive use of POV shots, all of which manage to work their way into ""Mission: Impossible."" Thematically, it's nowhere as hard edged as ""Casualties of War"" or ""Body Double"" but this is unmistakably a Brian De Palma film and he leaves his fingerprints all over it. The second Mission: Impossible film had a very different kind of action film director with John Woo, who also left his very unique style of action on that film, which made me quite excited about this franchise, where each film would feature a different director who's bring their own unique vision to the series. The subsequent sequels directed by J.J. Abrams, Brad Bird, and Christopher McQuarrie (all good films and all good directors) did not stand apart from one another nearly as much as Woo and De Palma's films did. I think it would have been fun to have continued to seek diverse action film directors to tackle each new films. Who wouldn't want to see Luc Besson, Walter Hill, John Milius, James Cameron, or Michael Mann directed a Mission: Impossible sequel, though they may be too big for a franchise films, but still, a sequel directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, Gareth Evans, Kathryn Bigelow, Matthew Vaughn, Takashi Miike, or Edgar Wright seems completely plausible and super exciting. But I digress.

Tom Cruise gives an incredible lead performance and Ving Rhames, Jean Reno and Jon Voight are all great. Brian De Palma's direction is fantastic, it's extremely well filmed and expertly paced.

It has all the usual spy stuff: spyglasses, hidden microphones, laptops, elaborate disguises, exploding cars, knifings, shootings, bodies toppling into a river, etcBasically, a mole has broken into the group's inner circle; the mission was an attempt to flush him out. But instead of exposing the real culprit, it throws suspicion on team member Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), who is forced to go underground to prove his innocence.We've seen some of this in Jules Dassin films, but not even Bond has a chase scene like the one here.The bottom line on a film like this is, Tom Cruise looks cool and holds our attention while doing neat things that we don't quite understand",Mission - Impossible
82,onepotato2,Mission Incorrigible,1,19 June 2006,"Mission Impossible is the movie that could only come from DePalma and Cruise. The former is a hack and the latter is a real drip. The plot is set in motion when the good guys ""knock list"" is stolen. But the thieves learn it was a bogus knock list, so it's vitally important to replace the knocklist or the bad guys will realize their goods are bad. Mostly the plot is an excuse for characters to say ""knock list"" a lot, and you get to see Cruise play an unbearably cocky ass in Eruope for a change. Plotwise it's pretty stale; One guess as to who turns out to be the bad guy; yep, that's right, the person who was supposed to be the good guy. Gee, that's fresh. Cruise projects the kind of phony confidence of the guy who knows the ""right"" answer to give to those idiot job-interview questions. You know what I mean... ""What's your worst habit?"" followed by the correct answer that cloaks your success in flaws clothing: ""I drive myself too hard."" or ""I cry myself to sleep at night over my lack of flaws."" The type of deeply phony horse-sh*t that makes you roll your eyes and fills you with revulsion for the ass who would actually say it; the type of person who would give those answers and really sell it, not realizing that an impartial observer would retch over his teeming phoniness.Keep your eyes on Cruise though. The heyday of this type of this meathead tripe has lasted anachronistically into the era of the metrosexual. It's due to expire some time in the next 3 months. Cruise hasn't figured out that this kind of sales job makes him look really old, not young.

84,eric262003,More To Like About This Movie Aside From The Obvious,9,13 December 2015,"I can never quite figure out what makes ""Mission Impossible"" such a film that attracts me like it does. From the other viewers out there, the scenes that they're pining over the most include the break-in at the CIA headquarters and the chase scene at the Chunnel. These fans think that those two scenes are the reasons for seeing this movie. And though they are correct in that perspective that they are memorable scenes, but that's not the only reasons why I like ""Mission Impossible"". In fact there are far more better reasons why I like this movie a lot. Why do I enjoy this movie so much you may ask? Well for starters let's start with the leading character Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise). Unlike James Bond, Hunt refrains from being a spontaneous trigger-happy spy, who boozes on martini's and sleeps around with any female cohort who aligns with him. In this movie, he only handles a gun just one time, but never opens fire with it. It's a shame that John Woo who took over as a direction after this one had to go in that direction in the sequel. The top dog in the Impossible Mission Force (IMF) Ethan's fight plans are smart and methodical rather than casual and slick. He doesn't just randomly kills people one by one. Another characteristic I found so attached to Ethan Hunt was his decency towards female co-workers like Claire Phelps (Emmanuelle Beart) who goes as far as respects the fact that she is a married lady who happens to be married to his boss Jim Phelps (Jon Voight). In fact this spy movie doesn't have any sexual activity provided in this movie which makes it all the more refreshing. And these idiosyncrasies plus the precarious situation he's been put in, Ethan Hunt succeeds in being a relatively likable character. I'm only just observing the heart of the movie.Many people have blasted this film for being overbearingly convoluted, but that's a misnomer. If you have meagre attention spans, you may not like a film of this magnitude or those who were expecting a plethora of exciting flashy thrills or action effects. The film's intentions are for us as a viewer to be involved with the character/s and follow through within each scene. All the scenes, set-pieces and props all flow in a very immaculate perspective. Being antsy to watch something wow will likely never happen here. You feel like part of the action with Ethan and when things start to unfold, you'll react just like the way Ethan does.What were my favourite scenes in ""Mission Impossible""? Well as much as I agree with the Chunnel chase as being very exciting, I thought the best scenes were his interactions with Phelps in the final scenes. ""It was Kittredge"". Phelps was so convincing, and we all know Ethan knows that's far from the truth. We see him summarizing all the events from the Prague mission in his mind. It's not that easy to contradict someone like Phelps because he's Ethan's superior. Then he asks this esoteric question, ""Why..Jim Why""? Which translates to ""Why would Kittridge do it, when really the question is why would YOU do it?""It's the more deeper content of ""Mission Impossible"" that make this movie all the more special. This movie is not the ""all style and no substance"" that most viewers have complained about. But to hell with them, I won't let them deprive me from enjoying it. Even after 20 years, this movie never gets old. If anyone wishes to disagree with me feel free, but your opinions will not change my opinion about this movie.",Mission - Impossible

It's a classic, action packed spy film which you could say has not only sparked off one of the greatest franchises of all time, but has sparked off the action/spy craze sub-genre! The vault scene especially, which is the ""Shower Scene From Psycho"" esque icon which has been parodied, inspired & repeatedly used in all forms of media from cartoons to adverts on the TV etc!The action in the film is pretty non-stop & the set pieces are ace! While the opening is not as great as the later installments, it's still good! The story is great too & keeps you engaged & locked in from start to finish!

86,philip_vanderveken,"An extra long, modernized and enhanced episode",7,26 January 2005,"I've never been very keen on movies that are based on old(er) TV-series, because I've never seen the point of them, except for trying to make even more money out of a good concept of course. In a way Mission Impossible isn't any different from other movies that have been based on a series, but it still is good enough to keep you entertained for a couple of hours. Not that it is all that original. Of course it has been modernized and enhanced by using the latest special effects and computer animation their budget could buy and yes it all looks very spectacular, but in fact this isn't much else but a longer version of an average episode.Ethan Hunt, an American agent of a secret service called the IMF, is believed to be disloyal to his employer and is suspected of having killed almost his entire team of spies. He isn't the real traitor and knows that someone else in his team or in his secret service is the real bad guy. He has to find out what really happened and who is the guy they are looking for. In the meanwhile he has to stay out of the hands of some assassins who are send after him. Will he survive? Will he find out the shocking truth? It's up to you to discover...Don't expect an excellent and mind blowing story line. If it wasn't for the, especially at that time, stunning special effects and many plot twists, this movie would have gone by unnoticed. In fact this movie is nothing more but a 110 minutes taking roller-coaster ride. It's fun to do, but not for too many times in a row. I guess the true fans of the series will be the ones who love this movie the most. Even though I called it nothing more but a longer episode, I still give it a 7/10. It's OK, without being really special",Mission - Impossible
87,screenman,Mission Implausible,8,3 January 2008,"This movie is an edge-of-the-seat roller-coaster ride. Cruise and Voight head a capable group of actors through a labyrinth of pyrotechnics and special effects and some needlessly graphic violence. The whole thing is so completely overblown and implausible that the acting is franked by the same stamp. There are situations that could scarcely be imagined outside of the movies, let alone anticipated, and so it would be impossible to imagine how one might react. As a result, human behaviour is of the the most banal, juvenile comic-book kind. It's how children would behave.The story is suitably complex. There is wheeler-dealing and betrayal. And of course suspicion and discovery. It is a cosmopolitan effort, too, with some nicely selected locations, after the fashion of that equally preposterous James Bond franchise. America's most secret facilities are juxtaposed against a very grubby old back-street near London Bridge, with which I am readily familiar. And later there's a pub in Rotherhithe from which I've had the pleasure to wobble home a couple of times.There is also a burglary so blatantly ripped-off from the older and more believable 'Topkapi' that I'm surprised it wasn't mentioned in the credits.I don't mean to criticise this movie out of hand. It's what it is: impossible - comic-book nonsense. Sit back and enjoy the ride. My only grumble is that this style is becoming increasingly perceived as 'normal' in a movie context. There is so much 'Matrix' style hokum finding its way into movies in general that reality itself seems to be in danger of ending-up on the cutting-room floor. Nothing more demonstrates this phenomenon than baddies with machine guns who seem quite incapable of hitting anything except windows which shatter spectacularly. Fast-moving heroes seem bullet-proof. Even a recent episode of CSI (a series with cerebral pretensions) saw Gary Sinise's character and a female side-kick, doing precisely this when their labs were invaded by armed villains. Then, within minutes they had set-up a bomb that was triggered by an invisible laser Field. Yep - I kid you not. Naturally, as a former lab technician, it's the first thing I thought of.Pretty soon the only believable broadcast will be the test-screen.",Mission - Impossible
88,brando647,Update of '60s TV Show Convoluted w/Great Action Scenes,8,6 June 2009,"I was one of the many people who were completely baffled upon first watching this movie, but I didn't let it deter me. Future viewings helped clear up what I hadn't grasped the first time and it's now safe to say that Brian De Palma's update of the 1960's television series makes for one of my favorite spy flicks. Based on the popular TV show, the film follows a team of IMF (Impossible Mission Force) agents as they pursue a renegade official attempting to sell vital information. Soon, the IMF is dead and the surviving member, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), is accused of being a traitor. Now Hunt must hunt down the true traitor while attempting to capture the black market information broker.Even trying to give a synopsis was enough to confuse myself. As I stated, there is enough double-crossing and false leads in this film to confuse the average viewer the first time through. Even if you find yourself having trouble following the convoluted plot, there are enough fantastic action sequences to keep the film entertaining. From the botched mission that results in the deaths of Hunt's IMF team to the theft of the information from a high-tech CIA vault, there are some seriously great suspense/action moments.This film helped me become a fan of Tom Cruise. I hadn't seen much of his 80's films before and I'd never paid him much attention, but I thought he did a great job as Hunt. Following the deaths of his teammates, he reforms with a group of disavowed agents consisting of two awesome actors that outshine Cruise (in my opinion), Ving Rhames and Jean Reno. Toss in Jon Voight as IMF team leader Jim Phelps (the only character of the TV show to transition to the film) and the gorgeous, soft-spoken Emmanuelle Beart as his wife Claire, and you have a great cast rounding out this busy popcorn flick.",Mission - Impossible

92,MartianOctocretr5,"High levels of action, not much else",4,15 May 2007,"Although there was an impossible mission in this movie, the story has nothing whatsoever to do with the classic TV series. In the show, a team of under cover specialists created an artificial situation for the benefit of the victim(s) of a ""Sting"" type operation, usually resulting with their enemies turning on each other.The ""IMF team"" in this movie pretty much refers to Tom Cruise alone, with the rest of the team reduced in status to nameless flunkies who just stand around and watch as he single handedly saves the world. The TV show's covert stealth premise was tossed out, since Cruise doesn't emote well enough to convey the tension of committing espionage right under a dangerous enemy's nose. Instead, the original format was replaced by cranked up action at an ""impossible"" James Bond on steroids level, with scenes such as the exciting but ridiculously over the top helicopter/train sequence. Other actors have woefully limited screen time, but act their parts faithfully. The original score from the show is utilized well, spicing up the action effectively. The script is shallow, and the entire mole ""twist"" bit is concealed as well as is as an elephant hiding behind an ant. It's also an insanely stupid plot twist, which spits on the TV series.

93,sme_no_densetsu,Departs significantly from its inspiration but still provides some thrills,7,7 October 2015,"Brian de Palma's adaptation of ""Mission: Impossible"" marked the beginning of a hugely successful franchise that's still going strong almost twenty years later. More of a Tom Cruise vehicle than a faithful adaptation of the highly regarded ensemble TV show, this 'Mission' was brought up to date with the latest (now, somewhat quaint) technology.The connection to the TV show is tenuous, since only one character features in both and, even then, the characterization is completely different. One could argue that this was an ingenious way of defying expectations but others (myself included) might counter that the movie may as well not have been an adaptation to begin with. That being said, despite initially veering off into a completely different direction, we do eventually get a legitimate 'impossible' mission in the spirit of the TV show.Tom Cruise is the undisputed star of the picture and he does a decent job, though this is definitely more of a showcase for Tom Cruise, movie star, rather than Tom Cruise, actor. Meanwhile, Jon Voight is always a welcome presence in any film and Vanessa Redgrave proved to be an astute casting choice. The various team members are generally well chosen; however, the least interesting character (played by Emmanuelle Beart) gets the most screen time.Brian de Palma's direction is as expertly handled as always and he produced at least one iconic scene (ie. the heist at CIA headquarters). The action set-pieces are well done, though the climax is wildly over the top. The music wisely re-uses (and revitalizes) the TV show's memorable theme.All in all, ""Mission: Impossible"" is fairly enjoyable but, for large chunks of the movie, there's a nagging feeling that the filmmakers have strayed too far from their inspiration.

98,TheUnknown837-1,call it a guilty pleasure,7,13 December 2008,"Every now and again, you will come upon a film that you know really isn't the best movie in the world, or even a particularly good movie on its own. And yet, despite its glaring flaws and imperfectness and lack of completion, you do find yourself strangely attached to it because it has a charm to itself that keeps you interested. Call it a guilty pleasure.Mission: Impossible is my guilty pleasure. It's based on a 1960s television series created by Bruce Geller and the movie with Tom Cruise is kind of like a mash-up between The Bourne Identity and the James Bond pictures. Basically, the standard spy movie. Tom Cruise plays a spy who is falsely accused of betrayal to his organization and finds himself working with some unlikely partners to track down the real mole in the system and expose him and clear his name. Now, this is a plot as old as the hills and Mission: Impossible works with it just as well as the others. Not enormously well, but on an acceptable level.Tom Cruise is great as the film's action hero lead, unfortunately his supporting cast is quite uninteresting. Another defect worth noting is the film's convoluted plot, which sometimes is hard to follow. This is caused by a screenplay in need of revisions. That's one of the film's major weaknesses and really the reason why it's just a standard spy movie with lots of cool gadgets instead of something special.But that's really my only significant complaint about Mission: Impossible. Those rather small, unimportant defects left aside, and leaving the movie to its own devices, it works out well especially in its action sequences. Again, it's all been done before, sometimes better sometimes worse, but that doesn't meant it's boring or overdrawn. In fact, sometimes it's very primal. There is one scene in particular that I found intense and suspenseful on a hair-raising level. The scene goes on for an unremittingly long time, keeping us on the edges of our seats, and the best thing of all is that it's silent. The filmmakers could have chosen to go along with some dark, heavy music or some ominous heartbeat sound effects to put us in the same shoes with the characters, but the fact that it's quiettoo quiet for our likingmakes it so much more compelling. I only wish the rest of the movie was like this scene. Then it really would have been special.Nevertheless, De Palma's Mission: Impossible works out well for what it is and unless you're not a fan of the standard spy movies or action pictures in particular, of if you have your standards and hopes up too high, I imagine you will enjoy it. Again, it is kind of a guilty pleasure, but hey, it was a lot of fun.",Mission - Impossible
99,baumer,Cruise: With An Attitude,7,26 May 2000,"Warning: may contain spoilersPeople say that if you can go into Mission Impossible and try to ignore the plot, then the film is fun to watch.  And although I can agree that the film is a little laden with what can only be attested to as the banalities of scriptwriting, I have to admit that if you watch this film perhaps for a second or third time, the plot isn't just more clear, it is quite well done. So when the second Mission Impossible was unleashed to us, the makers promised a somewhat diametric film from the first.  And that is not always a good thing because I believe this one to be superior to the sequel.  Am I going to tell you the exact plot of the film to make it transparently clear for you?  No, of course not, I don't think that is possible.  I am still confused by some of the film but just suffice to say that where I was once apathetic to the film, I am now in appreciation of it.  This is a great action film that has a heavy but interesting story to go with it.  If you can listen and decifer what is being said, I think you can have fun with it.The crux of the story is that Ethan Hunt has to prove to his superiors that he is innocent of extortion, cajolery and all those other terrible sounding international espionge words.  It seems that IMF, the network that he works for, thinks that his parents have received an unjust amount of money in their bank account.  His father has gone bankrupt and all of a sudden a large sum of money has appeared in his account.  Cruise has to clear his name without the help of agency but he can still enlist the help of some rogue agents that are willing to help him.  This is where some really great casting comes into play when Jean Reno and Ving Rhames are recruited for the job.  That is only part of the story.  The rest of the story involves the confusing stuff.  Who is the bad guy, who lives, who dies, what is on the disc, who wants the disc, why is the Bible involved and so on and so on. Do I have the answers for all of this?  No, of course not.  But I can tell you that from the opening sequence in the film it is at least fun and entertaining if not a little confusing.Mission Impossible is a pastiche of James Bond films, James Cameron films and perhaps even films like French Connection and Bullit.  But that does not mean that it doesn't have a style of it's own.  One of the most breath-taking and intensely filmed scenes is the one in the agency.  We have all seen this one in the commercials and if we remember anything from Mission Impossible, it is this one sequence.  This is a tour de force in directing and Brian DePalma should accept many kudos for his work here.  I am generally not a huge fan of his but this film is done with Hitchcockian ambiance in some ways.  And this one scene is coup de maitre of the film.Mission Impossible is loaded with great stunts, an admittedly confusing but compelling story and a buffed up Cruise doing what he does best....pleasing the audience.  If you toss in Ving Rhames with his one liners and his unmistakably Marcellus Wallace manerisms, Cruise's funny yet serious diatribes like ""You have never seen me angry Kitteridge."" and enough spy stuff to please any fan of the Bond genre, then what you have is a pretty good movie.  At the very least you can say that there is nothing remotely prosaic about the film.  This is an action packed story with lots of espionage, double crossing and plenty of missions that seem impossible.This review will self destruct in 5 seconds......7 out of 10",Mission - Impossible

101,IonicBreezeMachine,"Mission: Impossible is brought back on the big screen in a gold standard for not just TV adaptations, but Hollywood blockbusters",8,23 December 2020,"Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is an agent with the IMF(Impossible Mission Force) who along with team lead Jim Phelps (Jon Voight) and other IMF agents to retrieve a stolen list of agents from the American Embassy in Prague. The mission fails and leaves Hunt as the lone survivor of the team which leads the IMF to believe he's a mole. Hunt goes on the run to clear his name and find the true mole who killed his name and framed him.Directed by Brian De Palma who kicked off the Hollywood trend of adapting TV shows to film with his version of The Untouchables, De Palma once again finds himself adapting a classic TV show with Mission: Impossible. One of the longest running and most beloved of the 60s wave of espionage TV series features great actors like Peter Graves, Martin Landau, Sam Elliott, and Leonard Nimoy, the show had an a great legacy and reputation that had only grown in the years since thanks to routine broadcast in syndication. Luckily much like The Untouchables, De Palma understands the appeal of the series and gets it right in adaptation (for the most part)The movie much like the show is very much based on the details of the caper rather than fisticuffs or shootouts like other spy series. The opening op in the embassy in Prague is a nail biter as it takes us through what seems like a typical Mission: Impossible op only for everything to go wrong. From there the movie stretches itself away from the show's formula without breaking itself away as the main thread is very much about clearing Ethan's name while still utilizing the team based dynamic the series was so well known for. The movie is filled with suspenseful sequences, and was unique for its time as despite being a big budget Summer blockbuster, there's no gun fights and the only time guns are scene are in flashbacks a total of five times so it uses other ways of creating suspense quite effectively.The movie does have a few points that I should point out. Mission: Impossible has been criticized for being overly convoluted and difficult to follow. I'll admit that there are sequences where I wasn't sure how one part lead to another, but upon repeated viewings the pieces became more clear, and even upon a first viewing I still understood the gist of what was going on. Another point of criticism (sort of) is the movie's canonicity to the original TV series. Without giving away too much Jim Phelps as characterized in the film has sparked ire with fans of the show believing it wouldn't be fitting with his character. This is why Peter Graves doesn't reprise his role as Phelps because, like the fans, he too did not like the direction the filmmakers wanted to go. Apparently earlier drafts would've incorporated other characters from the show in some fashion (mostly cameos) but like Graves they turned them down and are not addressed in the final product. I understand the ire that some fans feel, but with that said Bruce Geller deliberately designed the show to feature as little character development as possible so people would focus mostly on the caper of the week. So while one could argue about how different Phelps is from the TV show, I don't think it's possible to get THAT mad about it since the show never gave him that much character in the first place.Mission: Impossible is a terrific example of not just TV adaptations done right, but blockbusters in general. The movie is a smart well acted thriller that knows how to keep suspense dialed up and keep the audience guessing where it's going to lead.",Mission - Impossible

I find myself re-watching it a lot mainly due to the great set pieces contained throughout the film. A major part of its appeal is the movie-set style cinematography. It doesn't feel like ""location shooting"". There's a real old Hollywood appeal to the film. It keeps the focus on the characters and situation at hand and gives the film a personal feel. There isn't all this expansive, showy cinematography and crazy effects like in the sequels. It's like the film itself is a multi-act play done on a sound stage or in a studio, kind of a modern day version of those great 30s and 40s films set in foreign places. Yet it still has an appealing modern sensibility.The plot is amazingly simple: a rogue CIA agent plans to steal and sell the non-official cover (NOC) list to the highest bidder on the international market and a team of IMF agents is assigned to stop the transaction. The team is led by Jim Phelps (played by Jon Voight) and includes Phelps' wife Claire (Emmanuelle Beart), Sarah Davies (Kristin Scott Thomas), Hannah Williams (Ingeborga Dapkunaite), Jack Harmon (an uncredited Emilio Estevez), and the final member of our team Ethan Hunt(played by the film's star, the versatile Tom Cruise).This is definitely one of my favorite Tom Cruise movies. I always forget about this film in Cruise's arsenal, maybe b/c it's just so enjoyable of a film experience to me and so I forget that I am watching Tom Cruise and just get totally into the film itself. Cruise is truly effortless in his portrayal of Ethan Hunt. He had never really done an action film before this and he is completely believable.Every member of the team (except Ethan) is killed during the mission. The operation was really a mole hunt to weed out the real traitor, so Ethan is suspect #1 in the eyes of the CIA. The rest of the film is Ethan trying to clear his name, so he puts together his own team to find the real culprit. The new team includes Claire (who turns out survived the initial mission), Franz Krieger (Jean Reno), and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames). This leads to the best scene of the film: the hacking of the CIA central computer where Hunt has to enter through the ceiling upside down suspended on a tightrope mechanism. I never tire of this suspenseful scene. A DePalma keeper!DePalma directed MISSION IMPOSSIBLE with is usual style of suspenseful, tense, well-laid out scenes, like the CIA break-in where there is the continuous tracking shot of the team going their separate ways to do their various tasks. The film is essentially a series of entertaining, tongue-in-cheek set pieces with tense character interactions as it is hard to know who Ethan can trust in his quest for the truth and THREE memorable set pieces: (1) the early Aquarium restaurant scene in Prague, the (2) aforementioned CIA break-in, and (3) the climactic speeding train scene from London to Paris. I also like the minor tweaks to the MI theme from the 60s series, updated to fit a modern Hollywood film. The plot really plays second fiddle to the action and intrigue, though.",Mission - Impossible
103,vip_ebriega,A second look: MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE,10,2 July 2008,"My Take: An underrated big-screen version of the classic TV series. The plot no longer confuses after a second view. A thrill-a-minute machine.At first glance, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE is quite like a self-constructing Rubix cube which finishes itself in the finale, but it rarely remains clear how it got there. But after seeing it again the other night, it became clear to me that MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE wasn't quite as complicated nor convoluted, considering how much complicated other espionage thrillers of this kind have turned out to be. Do yourself a favor: Turn your brains in the ""on"" position, keep your ears on the listen and wallow in the action-packed, special effects-laden summer entertainment.The plot itself is a thing of beauty. Where else can you see such a plot that moves from manhunts to double cross, and more secret agent/conspiracy jargon one summer viewer can possibly handle. So go get your glass of water or something, for you wouldn't wanna miss a single strand of detail in this complex summer popcorn action thriller of the adults. Tom Cruise is still terrific as the famed (and framed) IMF (Impossible Mission Force) agent Ethan Hunt, point-man to IMF director Jim Phelps (Jon Voight, taking over the role from Peter Graves) during a mission to retrieve a NOC (Non-Official Coverts) list, before it goes out in the open, exposing IMF agents from their aliases. After an ambush which spelled certain failure of the mission, Hunt is framed as the suspected moll working for illegal arms dealer named Max (Vanessa Redgrave). To clear his name, Hunt goes over the edge. Whether it has him breaking into CIA secretly while dangling atop the ceiling, or take form of numerous disguises that would make any fan of the original series proud.The plot gets much more complicated than it sounds, since writers Robert Towne, David Koepp and Steve Zaillian throw in every situation and plot twists it could. The result, while admittedly thick, is clever and gripping. Director Brian DePalma owes more to Alfred Hitchcock than Bruce Gellar, as the film is more thriller than action, but the film works as an exciting piece of entertainment. Clever, fast and and is especially great at keeping the audience guessing. The cast is especially great, even if they aren't exactly Oscar-caliber. Cruise is an especially reliable hero, Voight makes an excellent replacement for Peter Graves (unsatisfied to reprise the role for this film) and Henry Czerny plays another mysterious government figure (after CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER) as Eugene Kittridge. French beauty Emmanuelle Beart sizzles as Phelps' wife Claire and Ving Rhames & Jean Reno play disavowed agents recruited by Hunt to pull off the ""Mt. Everest of hacks"".Nothing is at it seems in this film, since DePalma pulls of everything with gusto, Hitchcock-style. Espionage, thrills, and that slam-bang finale (a fight on a speeding bullet train, having a helicopter fly through a tunnel). DePalma also doesn't drown the film with as much special effects as other summer movie rivals, resulting in one of the more promising piece of unadulterated adult summer attraction. Warning: This message will now self destruct in T-minus 3 seconds. 3... 2... 1...Rating: ***** out of 5.",Mission - Impossible
104,educallejero,It works. Forgettable,5,13 June 2020,"A first act, not boring exactly but close, we get to know this group of international agents/spies in a very urgent and important mission. After it goes wrong, the movie actually gets more interesting with the consequences of that failure.
The intricated story and script is by far the better aspect of the movie. From the minute 35 and on, we have a non-stop of a interesting action thriller, with well done tension and good twists.Having said that, the start is somehow slow, even when it is basically a 30' mission. That includes the presentation of a huge bunch of pathetically boring characters, without any personality or charm. Literally non of them is either likeable or memorable. I guess all the attention was paid to the plot, but the lack of good characters contributed for a very dry film.
I also didn't like the editing, that didn't make the first act exciting in any way (again, it was a mission), nor the score that was barely in the movie at the start and by the end was so invasive and loud and pointless (maybe compensating for the lack of good characters?).
In the end, the strenght of the script and story saved the rest of the elements of this movie.",Mission - Impossible

This movie falls into the later group. I never thought Mr. Cruise would do much with this genre, but I have to do a major retraction...right now, he is my preferred action star. Ethan Hunt starts this series out right. From the first Mission Impossible movie onward, they have just improved. This is an excellent beginning. I understand people might have been looking for 'Paris', or a Barbara Bain Martin Landau type mix...I know I was. And I will admit that I kind of wanted to see a reboot of the old players, but gone are Barney, Willie, Mr. Phelps and the gang. It didn't take long to adjust to the new version. The action, direction and pace are outstanding. Tom Cruise and cast makes this a gem worthy of multiple views. I highly recommend this movie along with future installments.",Mission - Impossible

107,stamper,"Well, pretty good I must say (critics: Remember what the title says Impossible, so prepare)",7,18 June 2000,"With all the talk going on about Mission Impossible 2 I watched this one again (for the 2nd time) yesterday as a warm  up (Mission Impossible 2 is due here next month) and I must say I liked it pretty much.I was one of those folks who went to see this flick in the cinema, almost 4 years ago and I must say, I was pretty much disappointed. The Trailer had somehow made me believe that this was a high  speed action vehicle in the likes of a Die Hard with a bit of a Bond twist. This was not it. It was even more James Bond than James Bond, as referring to the spy stuff and that I did not like at all. I expected a sort of Goldeneye  like movie (as much action anyway and as much spy stuff). By the way, why is it Mission: Impossible and not Gadgets: Impossible? Or Events: Impossible? I mean this could be a Die Hard, Die Hard 4: Die Impossibly Hard. But I do not tend to rate movies on their believability, or why else would I love, Lethal Weapon 3, Die Hard 1+3, Goldeneye, The World is not Enough and so on.But hey that was 4 years ago, what did I think this time? Well, it was pretty good. There was a good story, which was at times a bit complicated, but you could follow and there were a few tense and exciting scenes. Yet there was not nearly as much action as in the Mission Impossible 2 Trailer. But that is not so bad after all.The actors all were OK, except one and I do not mean Cruise here, for I don't like him that much anyway. He is too much of a smoothie and he is much too slick for my feeling (please no hate-mail). The best one was VING RHAMES, yes him, he is a very talented actor and one who can always make me smile and laugh. He has got an incredible way of letting his face speak' in some way and he always seems to be a jolly and nice guy in this one. Yet he can be mean and dangerous (as in Con Air).Despite all that I was not excited all the time and on the edge of my seat. Sometimes there was too much talking and stuff involved and yet sometimes actors had funny lines, there was too much talking. Don't get me wrong, but I prefer Goldeneye to this one, you now with the standard Bond formula which includes: wits, action, exotic locations and very pretty female companions. This was: spy stuff, talk, plot and twists.Still 7 out of 10",Mission - Impossible
108,fernandoschiavi,The perfect balance between the most impossible things that modern cinematic technique allows and the purest Hitchcockian suspense in a blockbuster of espionage and action,8,18 July 2020,"The 1980s were marked by a more visceral action cinema, enshrined in icons such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Mel Gibson and Bruce Willis in some of the most lucrative film franchises. In that same decade, a young actor appeared in films like ""Top Gun"", ""Rain Man"" and ""Born on the 4th of July"", but it was in 1996 that Tom Cruise in fact became the new action star of cinema. The star, alongside producer Paula Wagner, decides to adapt the TV series of the same name from the 1960s, inviting the renowned director Brian De Palma, the man behind classics like ""Carrie (1976)"", ""Scarface (1983) "","" The Untouchables (1987) ""and Carlito's Way (1993)"". Ultimately, filmmakers are able to produce an efficient blend of modern cinematic art with a beautiful reverence to the classics of old, with a simple script that works the dynamics of betrayals and revelations constantly without dynamizing the very base on which it is based.During a mission in Prague, a special group of agents is trapped. American Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) discovers that only he and another agent survived. Taken as an informant, he runs away and begins to act on his own. With the help of a new group, he will try to clear his name, finding out who was the spy who set up his team.The interest of an actor-producer in turning an old series into a cinematic success, and a director who has always assumed himself (and was singled out) as an heir to the thriller master Alfred Hitchcock could not result in anything other than what resulted: a success thunderous, which gave rise to a more lasting and applauded film franchises. Mission: Impossible was produced in a period in which action films were not yet made with incessant cuts that prevent the viewer from understanding what is happening or polluted with excessive absurd computer graphics effects. It is the missing link of a genre that twenty-two years later seems to have been almost completely given over to the frenzy of modernity that is unable to keep its attention focused on any scene that lasts more than two seconds. And the result is a spy and action film that can easily be labeled a modern classic. The modern spy movie, with fantastic copies like (almost all) the Bourne series films and the 007 reboot, has, in its DNA, Mission: Impossible traits.The script by David Koepp (screenwriter also from the classic Jurassik Park) and Robert Towne's greatest asset is knowing how to work the dynamics between the characters and the suspense in a precise way, knowing how to introduce and increase the suspense, revealing the details little by little in twists and turns that surprise audiences all the time (in line with the fundamental thesis that the camera lies) with a dynamic of betrayals, twists and revelations that sew the whole narrative into small pieces that are inserted one by one, millimeter, while the story advances. It is true that the script uses clichés of the genre, such as the recruitment of agents with a dubious reputation, a protagonist who is always far ahead of the others, jaw-dropping gadgets (the bubble gum and the mask of classic series) and so on, but it turns out that each of the pieces is fitted mill metrically by the direction of De Palma and by the charismatic performance of Cruise.
In this aspect, Brian De Palma shows all his talent using his enviable experience, starting the main photography without a final script, already working on the most intricate sequences of action and then fitting them into the broader structure of the narrative still being stitched. In less skillful hands, this would be the right recipe for resounding failure, but that is not what we have witnessed. Among several emblematic sequences, such as the opening prologue, the entire IMF operation in Prague, the explosion of the restaurant with a huge aquarium tank and the insane final action, with Ethan and Phelps defying the laws of physics on top of a train- bullet and a helicopter chasing the composition in the Eurotunnel, the one that stands out most is the one that happens in the maximum security safe installed inside the American Intelligence Center, in Langley, Virginia. This iconic and unforgettable sequence became the hallmark of the Mission: Impossible franchise and certainly occupies its position among the most emblematic scenes in the history of cinema. The place resembles a futuristic setting. The security system is virtually impenetrable: voice recognition, numeric password, retina authentication, check-in, temperature sensor, sound sensor and weight sensor. A mission literally impossible, but not for Ethan and his new team. The moment when the group invades the agency's headquarters in Langley is a masterpiece of cinematic suspense and becomes even more extraordinary when we remember that it is conducted by De Palma without the use of a soundtrack - it is curious that a franchise marked by a of the most recognizable themes in the history of cinema, have your most famous scene erected without it.Several scenes in Mission: Impossible work only thanks to the quality of De Palma in the direction. Whether it's the tense conversation between Hunt and his boss at a restaurant (when the filmmaker frames the characters' faces from the bottom up), the invasion of the CIA computer or the final sequence on the train, Mission: Impossible is full of efficient and exciting moments. The scene of the train, although exaggerated, is in line with the content of the rest of the film, which does not take your feet off the ground in completely improbable moments. For this reason, it is strange to watch the final sequence spent on the train (even if it is exciting), as it throws up all the possibilities of realism created during the rest of the work. This moment, in fact, seems more suited to the second chapter of the series, when John Woo makes it clear from the beginning that verisimilitude will not be found in that film.De Palma inoculate his deeply authorial blockbuster with the magic of visual compositions that play with the expectations of the characters and spectators. The farcical tone is evident even in the initial sequence of Mission: Impossible when an interrogation scene reveals a false construction assembled and dismantled by the team of Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) - who after getting what he wanted from the tortured criminal, takes off a mask silicone face, revealing your true face. While fully dialoguing with modern cinematography, with breathtaking action sequences, Mission: Impossible pays total reverence for the old classics of espionage and action.The director also teaches using angles that capture the actors' facial expressions and their looks full of doubts and suspicions like few others. The dialogue between Ethan and Phelps in the third act is a lesson in subjectivity. The continuous dance between the version that Voight tells and what Cruise seems to imagine in his mind plays with what the two know of each other. Did Voight notice that he was discovered by his pupil? If Cruise now knows about his friend and mentor's betrayal, what will be his next steps? De Palma's obsession with the power of the image is fully summarized in the sequence in which Ethan is confronted by Krieger and in response performs a series of magic tricks using the NOC List, the film's McGuffin as a ""letter"". All to find out later that the NOC List was all the time in the hands of Krieger, who, fooled by Ethan, ends up throwing the floppy in the trash. This very intelligently defines the cinematographic ethos of the director and also the whole game of falsehood and subtleties that we follow throughout the film. Conspiracies, false leads, frames, double agents, infiltration in the safest places in the world, messages that self-destruct in five seconds, high technology: all the classic elements of espionage are placed on the table and are very well used.The soundtrack, composed by Danny Elfman maintains its mark of pure pasteurization. The composer even has flares of creativity here and there in some films, but in this one he writes bureaucratically, without much intention of doing something memorable. The immortal musical theme created by Argentine Lalo Schifrin was reinterpreted by Larry Mullen Jr. and Adam Clayton, from the Irish group U2. The two maintained the style of the original orchestration, modernizing it with electronic effects.If, today, Mission: Impossible may not be comparable to the absolute frenzy of its modern peers, made for audiences who are unable to maintain their attention if the cut is more than three seconds long, this is absolutely not the fault of the production. ""Mission Impossible"" is an action and espionage film that has almost no gunshots and has long plans in silence. What Brian De Palma achieved here was the perfect balance between the most impossible things that modern cinematic technique allows and the purest Hitchcockian suspense in a blockbuster of espionage and action, a modern classic of the genre.",Mission - Impossible

110,russem31,Great movie.,8,7 May 2006,"""Mission: Impossible"", a 1996 film directed by Brian De Palma, is a great film. I do know others have found it jarring with a confusing storyline and I have to somewhat agree. However, there are many other elements which make this a very enjoyable film - first and foremost, I love the cinematography - the tilted angles which shows how chaotic the situation that Ethan Hunt (played by Tom Cruise) is put in. Jim Phelps (played by Jon Voight) expertly plays his mentor in an interesting role. Ving Rhames stars as Luther Stickell (the only other character besides Ethan Hunt who is in all 3 films so far). Emmanuelle Beart as Claire Phelps also makes an appealing love interest. The action sequences are top-notch (especially the helicopter sequence at the end!) and the music is very fitting (by master composer Danny Elfman).

DePalma hasn't really ventured into espionage territory before, but here manages just that with dynamic efficiency. As most of his previous films it is all about atmosphere and suspense as a winding plot takes you down many surprising twists and turns. Tom Cruise, in the main role, is great and he manages to make the movie slick and cool with his ever likable on screen presence.There are terrific set pieces including a break-in to an ""impenetrable"" vault of CIA information and, of course, the spectacular climatic sequence on top of a high-speed train.

The action sequences feel as if they serve the story not vice versa and among the highlights are the truly memorable break in to CIA headquarters and the sequence on the train.

117,anselmdaniel,A tense and tight movie adaptation,7,6 November 2020,"This review contains spoilers.Mission: Impossible is a spy action movie starring Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt. Ethan Hunt is a part of the Impossible Missions Force which specializes in impossible missions. Ethan Hunt is framed for a mission gone wrong that causes his IMF team to be killed with Ethan Hunt as the sole survivor. Ethan seeks out the actual mole and must stay one step ahead of the authorities seeking his arrest.Mission: Impossible is a fun movie. There are loads of action scenes that are thrilling to watch. These action scenes are the main appeal of this movie. Each action set piece is well set-up by the rest of the movie and that leads to good pacing on the director's part. It does get tiring seeing the action at times, but Tom Cruise does a good job as Ethan Hunt. He is able to convey the sheer desperation of the mission and how it close it is to failure.The parts of the movie that are not great is when the movie slows down to develop its characters. Ethan Hunt is a two-dimensional character. He is simply an action hero in this movie. His only difference is that he does not use firearms. The movie does a good job with handling this gimmick and it was never forced onto the viewer.I recommend Mission: Impossible. The later movies feel different compared to the original, however the original still has that charm that started the entire franchise. That charm is worth visiting here.Grade: B",Mission - Impossible
118,msbreviews,Rating: A-,8,29 July 2018,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Mission: Impossible - Fallout is coming out next week, so naturally I decided to watch and review every single movie of the franchise. With so many remakes and reboots of famous sagas, it is a breath of relief that M:I is actually one that makes sense to keep doing. Since the third installment that it keeps continuously improving on the previous film and the evolution of visual effects didn't even affect the movies' essence. If there's one thing that this franchise is known for, is the realistic and practical method of filming action, instead of the CGI which is being used in excess more and more each day that goes by.By the time of the original release of this film, Tom Cruise was not yet an action movie icon. He was still trying to prove himself, and this was the film that started it all. Not only he portrays an exceptional character, but he tremendously elevates it when it comes to the action moments. He is also really expressive in the suspenseful scenes, and he is directly connected to some of the most prominent and extraordinary tension moments in the action movies history.Ethan Hunt, our hero, is very well-written and extremely interesting. The several ways by which he tries to decipher who framed him are filled with great details, amplified by the remarkable work of Brian DePalma, as the director. Excellent shots and phenomenal control of the tension in every scene. For a film released more than 20 years ago, most of its craft still holds up pretty well.As for the remaining cast, Ving Rhames stands out as Luther since he brings a very cool and funny vibe to the movie. Jon Voight portrays Hunt's boss, Jim Phelps, and he definitely leaves a good impression. Everyone else just serves the plot as it goes and that is my main issue with this first installment. If there's one thing that the audience members of 1996 and 2018 have in common is that they want easy-to-follow stories and big, brainless, illogical action ...I praise Mission: Impossible because it really tries to have a mysterious storyline. After all, we are watching an espionage film. However, even with me paying attention to every single line, it is undoubtedly confusing, to say the least. There are a lot of details in the screenplay that just don't quite come together at the end. The antagonist's motivations are a bit unclear as well as the ones from the characters related to it. The action set pieces are filled with special effects, but the beginning of incredible practical stunts started with this one. Like I wrote above, one of the most iconic, suspenseful scenes in movie history, is when Hunt tries to break into the CIA. That scene alone makes action films nowadays look like an absolute waste of time and money. The amount of tension build up during that moment is ridiculous. The lack of background music is astonishingly ballsy, and it totally works. Everything about that scene is pure perfection!Throughout the movie, there are more than a couple of practical stunts but the ending kind of ruins it all. A completely illogical and absurd action sequence to end such a great film frustrates me a little bit, even considering the fact that this movie was not released in this century. I don't think it needed to be this ""blockbuster-y,"" and it breaks the realistic feel that the film had until that point.Before I forget, the score ... It is an impossible mission (ha...ha...ha) to forget the famous spy theme song. It is the tangible proof of the overwhelming success of this movie. It became the ringtone for most phones and even people that didn't watch any of the M:I films know the recognizable tone. Regarding the other definition of tone, it is another aspect that DePalma seamlessly balanced. The pacing never breaks down, and I didn't feel bored or distracted for a single second.The first installment of the Mission: Impossible franchise still incredibly holds up 20 years later. Tom Cruise is the living evidence of the movie's success as he became one of the most iconic action film stars. DePalma's last great movie is filled with excellent direction, a very captivating protagonist, some fantastic action scenes and a memorable soundtrack. However, in the writing department, things went a little overboard and the plot is too confusing. The ending action sequence is a bit of a letdown, but the frenetic pacing provides a blast of entertainment and one of the most influential action films of all-time.",Mission - Impossible
119,mahmus,"Extremely dated, but it started something beautiful",6,15 September 2020,"The infiltration in Prague, The break-in at the CIA headquarters, and the climax on the train.
This movies has those three awesome sequences and some pretty boring stuff in between.This franchise is one of my favorites in the action genre and part of the reason is because (excluding the second one) each new entry is better than the last. So naturally, coming back to the first one made for very dated, but still fun experience.After the first three films, with Ghsot Protocol, they stopped experimenting, as they had finally found the perfect direction in which to take the rest of the franchise. Those three aforementioned sequences served as the basis for that direction.Usually, when an action franchise abandons their slower, more character driven moments for more spectacle and action set pieces, it is seen as a negative.
With Mission: Impossible however, it was a wise desicion, because it became one of the most awesome action series, and I can't think of something more painful than watching Ethan Hunt surfing the 90's Internet for what feels like an eternity again.",Mission - Impossible
120,Maniac-9,A very good and suspenseful movie starring Tom Cru...,7,6 August 1998,A very good and suspenseful movie starring Tom Cruise in one of his best roles.  You could be watching 40 minutes of the movie and think that you have only been watching about 10 minutes of the movie.  Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt the point man for an IMF team who gets ambushed on a mission and is only one of two remaining members of his team.  But is set up and accused of being a mole leaking information for money to someone known as Max.  He has to then clear his name with the other surviving team member and Ving Rhames' Luther Stickell character who has been disavowed by the CIA.,Mission - Impossible
121,LebowskiT1000,One of my all-time favorite movies!,10,17 January 2003,"This is, without a doubt, one of my favorite films of all time!  I'll never forget watching this film for the first time with a good buddy of mine, afterward we couldn't stop talking about it and spent a great deal of time explaining plot points to each other.  We finally decided that we just had to see it again, so we did and all of our questions were answered and our theories proven correct.The story is nothing less than superb!  Every time you think you have the movie figured out they throw you for another loop, but not too much as to get you irritated trying to figure out the plot.  This is most definitely a film that deserves at least two viewings before you can truly understand and appreciate the story.  The characters are all excellent as well, although I was sad to see Jack Harmen (Emilio Estevez) get killed off so quickly, I liked his character.The cast is extraordinary!  Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt perfectly!  Jon Voight was the perfect choice for Jim Phelps.  Emmanuelle Beart was very good in her role.  Henry Czerny was superb as Kittridge.  Jean Reno was an excellent addition to the cast.  Ving Rhames was a very nice touch and really added a lot to the film.  Kristin Scott Thomas was lovely as always, although played a somewhat minor role in the greater scheme of things. Vanessa Redgrave was another nice addition to the cast.  And finally, Emilio Estevez (as I mentioned above), played a small role, and played it quite well.I can see why some of the big fans of the show wouldn't like this film due to certain plot points that I can't give away, so if you are a big fan of the show, be forewarned, you may have some issues with the film. Personally, I've never seen a single episode of the old television show, so I had absolutely no frame of reference.  Which, I believe, put me in a better position to appreciate the story.I feel that I have to mention the action scenes in this film! SPECTACULAR!!!  The scene where Kittridge and Hunt are talking in the restaurant...just AWESOME!  The entire last 20 minutes of the film...UNBELIEVABLE!!!  The filming, the action, the special effects and stunts alone make this film worth watching (but luckily, there is so much more to appreciate).If you are a fan of Tom Cruise, or just crime/mystery/action films in general, be sure to check this one out (at least twice).  This is honestly one of my top 20 films of all time, I truly hope that you will enjoy this film.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",Mission - Impossible
122,nicholls_les,Not Really Like The TV Series,2,1 July 2013,"I was anticipating this movie as I was an ardent fan of the original series and the remakes in the 80s. What a major disappointment this was. The film begins OK, But then it all falls apart and becomes just another run of the mill action movie using the same format that Hollywood churns out so often. Cruse is totally miss-cast and unconvincing,the point of the series was it's cleverness and the fact that you could not work out how they would do things. This was just the biggest disappointment on film I have seen, apart from the even worse 2 follow ups. I am sure many younger movie goers would like this film simply as an action film, but Mission Impossible it is not. And Jim Phelps turning traitor? Please!!!",Mission - Impossible

126,PyroSikTh,Time Has Not Been Kind,7,24 March 2021,"So in all this time it seems I've never actually reviewed the first Mission: Impossible. I've reviewed literally every other but this one, which means it must've been nearly ten years since I last watched it. In truth it's because it scratches a completely different itch than the other five movies, an itch that I end up scratching with other movies instead. When I want to watch a Mission: Impossible movie, I want to see Tom Cruise clinging on to planes, almost dying, or getting into knife fights on a beach while a dove flies by in the foreground. The first film is not that. The movie series that Tom Cruise has personally shepherded over twenty years into one of the most successful action franchises all started with a confusing, suspense-ridden spy affair of intrigue and betrayal.
Mission: Impossible, like all the others, predominantly follows Ethan Hunt, here a young IMF agent and merely one member of a team of spies. Hunt isn't even the boss here, he's just the muscle. That is until things go wrong in Prague, and he finds himself under suspicion of stealing a disk full of names of operatives out in the field. It's on him to prove his innocence, work out who set it all up, and find the buyer for the list.What actually surprised me the most when rewatching today was how remarkably simple the movie's structure is. It's three setpieces and some connective tissue between them. That's all. We have the opening mission in Prague, the betrayal, and Hunt put under suspicion, then we have the iconic heist in the CIA building, and then the movie closes with the climax on the train. Truth be told, when boiled down to their absolute basics, this is how a lot of movies are, but I haven't noticed it nearly as obviously as in this movie. Everything between these moments is just filler and exposition, which it was. The movie had already started building the sets before the script was even finished. The script had to be written around these three big moments, and it really shows. As a result the film is often criticised for being confusing, and I admit I always used to find it confusing as well. Except today when it all clicked perfectly and I could follow along every plot point, even though I had forgotten almost every little connective detail and crucial plot point.So SPOILER paragraph to explain what happens for anyone who still finds themselves confused by this movie; Jim Phelps is the mole who steals the list to sell to Max. Kittridge suspects there of being a mole and sets up a mole hunt. This is the opening sequence in Prague. Phelps fakes his death, and either he or Claire blows up the car with Hannah in, while Krieger (Claire's man for the heist) kills Sarah in the alleyway. Hunt realises it was Phelps when he finds the bible from a Chicago hotel, something Phelps mentions briefly at the beginning, which was the source of the code/password to contact Max. This meant Phelps was Job, and everything else was just logical deduction. Claire is also one of the survivors, and Hunt's infatuation with her is what blinds him to her betrayal, and creates that point of uncertainty over who killed Hannah (let's be honest, it was Claire; why else would she leave the car?)Unfortunately I can't say this movie has aged particularly well. The level of technology here is laughable when viewed today. Hunt literally types ""Internet Access"" into his computer, and then uses the search bar to give the computer commands. Our level of computing was certainly somewhat archaic back in the mid-90s, but even that is ridiculous. Furthermore a lot of the futuristic, out-there gadgets are not only perfectly plausible today, but by now a lot of it is old news as well. Watches that show photos/video? Wireless internet connection that gets lost in a tunnel? Glasses with tiny little cameras? But what ages this movie for me more than anything else is Danny Elfman's quintessentially 90s score. It's entirely orchestral and jam-packed full of as many themes and cues as humanly possible. A single piece barely sounds coherent, and more like a montage of different motifs that constantly chop and change into something else. If you've ever paid attention to movie scores from the 90s, you know exactly what this sound is, and Danny Elfman is the undisputed master of it, but oh god does it date the movie pretty badly.Mission: Impossible is often hailed as the best of the series, if only by virtue of being the original (despite many die-hard fans of the 60s TV show shunning it at the time for not being faithful enough), but honestly it's probably my least favourite. Yeah, the CIA heist is iconic for a reason. Ethan Hunt suspended from the ceiling is one of the most tense scenes ever put to film. But everything else is just okay. Don't get me wrong, it is enjoyable, and I enjoyed it more today than I probably ever have done before, but when compared to the other movies, especially the brilliant McQuarrie entries, this film is just dull. It's convoluted and yet simplistic at the same time, and its most exciting moments fall flat just because their ridiculousness in an otherwise grounded and restrained movie just feel out of place (at least M:I2 is cheesy and over-the-top throughout). I give the original 1996 Mission: Impossible a respectful but unfortunately overshadowed by its successors 7/10.https://qyrosmovies.blogspot.com/",Mission - Impossible
127,CinematicInceptions,Pretty mainstream spy thriller. One of the stronger films in the franchise.,7,3 May 2015,"Though this isn't the strongest of franchises, even in context of the spy genre alone, this re-imagining of the sixties TV show isn't too bad. So far Ghost Protocol is my favorite in the series, though it could get passed by Rogue Nation this summer. Still, this first installment is much better than 2 and 3, though they both fixed a couple of things that were wrong with the first film. Despite having the least action of the four, the movie is still predominantly action driven. It's overall quality is fair with an equal amount of flaws and strong points.The story is complicated, but not in a Prestige-esque way that makes you want to see it again to figure it out exactly. The confusion comes mostly from a number of technicalities that are hard to keep track of and are kind of vital in order to understand the story. It is possible to follow everything, but it takes so much concentration that it's likely to detract from the overall experience. But, as I said, it's action driven, so all you really need to know is that it's Ethan Hunt and company against everyone else and a couple of shifty allies. The area that the screenwriters could have improved in the most was the character interaction. We see that Ethan feels betrayed at various times by Kitteredge, Jim, and Claire, but the technicalities of the plot and slightly lacking character writing gets in the way. That's not to say that they did a terrible job writing the characters, but it just could have been better.Though it's considered an action film, the quantity of action is more fitting for a thriller. There are long stretches where we are deprived of any kind of fight scene and there is a lot of dialogue. The action sequences mainly come at the beginning and end. The more exciting scenes in the middle are just sort of tense and might feature some spy gear, such as the iconic scene where Ethan breaks into the IMF to get hold of the NOC list in the ultra high security room. Even almost 20 years later, some of the spy gadgets are still pretty cool like Jack's ""gum"" and the video glasses. There are no true fight scenes like in the subsequent three films (but that saves us from the annoying amount of slow motion used in MI:2).The acting is fair, with Tom Cruise giving the best performance. I thought Luther was played pretty well, though Jim and Claire both could have stepped it up a notch. Kitteredge felt rather clichéd, like a cross between an overly official Bourne antagonist and a threatening Bond villain. Since I viewed it long after it's release, I can't say whether the technical execution is good or bad, but it feels satisfactory given the technology at that time.It's not as good as the Bourne films or the Daniel Craig 007 installments, but might be appealing to fans of either franchise. Again, it's confusing and has less action than you would anticipate, which are both things for prospective viewers to be conscious of. I've heard that it isn't very true to the old TV shows, but given the thirty year hiatus, that isn't terribly surprising. However, the old theme is modernized well and from what I've read, nobody is very intent on comparing the show to the films. So I would probably recommend it to any action fan, especially if you want to get caught up before seeing Rogue Nation in July, but it won't top your lists. Overall Rating: 8.1/10.",Mission - Impossible
128,SKG-2,Slick but entertaining,8,27 April 1999,"A couple of things to get out of the way before I start.  First of all, I was not familiar with the TV series, so I don't have a history to compare it with like I did with, say, THE AVENGERS.  This is not to say I avoided seeing it, it just was never in syndication where I happened to live, or if it was, I just never noticed it.  On vacation one time, I did happen to catch a few episodes, but nothing stuck with me, except, of course, the catchphrases like ""Good morning, Mr. Phelps,"" ""Your mission, should you choose to accept it..."" and ""This message will self-destruct in five seconds.""  So those who said the movie suffered when compared to the show may very well be right, I just don't know.As for those who complained it was too confusing; with all due respect, you need to get out more.  I knew who the bad guy was within the first half hour, and so all you have to do is wait for the rest of the people to figure it out.Okay, now that I got all that out of the way; having seen this again on TV recently, first time since I saw it in the theater, I can confirm once again this is slick but still entertaining.  The main problem, as one critic said up here, is that this is neither an actor's movie nor a director's movie, but a story movie, and the story doesn't allow a lot of room for either the actors or the director to move.  You've got some good names here, but the only one with a character to play is Vanessa Redgrave, and she plays it beautifully(though Ving Rhames has some moments).  Especially lost is Emmanuelle Beart, a great actress and the most beautiful actress in movies today, but she's all wrong for the part here.  And though Brian DePalma stages some good scenes(especially, of course, the scene where Tom Cruise breaks into the computer room), he seems a little hamstrung by the plot. Maybe John Woo will do more with the sequel, I don't know.  Still, it is entertaining enough.  At least it wasn't like THE UNTOUCHABLES, which one critic aptly described as a beautifully wrapped package with nothing inside.",Mission - Impossible
129,Al_The_Strange,Mission Impossible Review,7,2 August 2015,"In the 90s, there was a pretty decent wave of spy movies; it started with a bang with 1994's explosive True Lies, which was shortly followed by the Brosnan era of James Bond, The Saint, Sneakers, and more. In the middle of this wave, Mission: Impossible burst into the blockbuster scene in '96, offering a flashier update on the classic TV series, complete with a prolific cast, some thrilling and memorable setpieces, and of course, action.There are some great moment in this film. One of the most famous scenes is watching Ethan infiltrating a high-tech vault on wires, dangling over a pressure-sensitive floor while hacking into a secure computer; it's still quite the tense scene. On top of that, the bullet train scene is pretty awesome. There is a good amount of fights, chases, and explosions. There is plenty of tech on display, which all seemed really cool in the 90s (to include self-destructing video tapes, glasses with cameras, explosive gum, computer stuff, and more). There's political intrigue abound, causing the plot to twist around with themes of deception and counter-deception. For a spy movie, Mission: Impossible offers plenty to enjoy.Unfortunately, the experience is hampered a bit by an overall feeling of dryness, causing some drag in between the more exciting scenes. This happens because the characters themselves are dry and fairly shallow caricatures; Ethan Hunt is a pretty standard action hero in this film, who watches his team fall apart and he's forced to go out on his own to find answers. This would be a great premise, but there's nothing much to Ethan's character to make us care for him. Without any personal stakes, the plot comes off as dry and shallow. There are neat ideas behind it, such as using a digital list of undercover agents as a MacGuffin, but on its own this is all rather dry and stuffy. On top of that, the film distances itself greatly from the source material; even though some names, some gadgets, and some aspects (like the use of masks) remain the same, the intrigue of the original show is ultimately replaced by pure spectacle. The original cast of the show hated this film, and if you're a fan of the original, chances are that you may not care for it (or its sequels) either.Fortunately, the film looks good and professional, with fantastic photography and solid editing. Tom Cruise does his usual schtick in his role, smiling a lot and acting all cocky; Jon Voight does his normal thing, and is pretty decent. The smaller roles by Jean Reno and Emilio Estevez are great. Other actors aren't bad. Writing could use more personality and color, but it's fine as it is. This production uses some really nice-looking locales, and some decent-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Danny Elfman's music score is a pretty standard variation on the classic TV show's theme.Mission: Impossible has a lot of cool parts, but the sum of those parts aren't quite as endearing. The various sequels, especially the third film, would properly align the series with a greater level of heart and ambition. As it is though, this first film is a pretty neat thriller, especially for its time.3.5/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Average | Film: Good)",Mission - Impossible
130,HEFILM,only gets a 2 because the sequel is even worse,2,16 December 2005,"Ego centered and senseless movie. Brian Depalma pulls off one cool scene involving an exploding restaurant otherwise a box office success that will be baffling to people who watch it once the Tom Cruise star has faded. If you love Tom (and he can deserve your love, just doesn't this time) you'll like the fact that for a ""team"" movie there is no Team it's all just Tom. That's fine if you don't remember the original concept of the cool TV show, and let's face it the makers of the film were betting you don't. Best moment however is when they briefly play the original theme music in a couple of spots. Dangling wire scene is a steal fro Topkaki--which for Depalma is a signature moment. What can you say about a career that has lasted for decades where his signature is stealing other directors signature moments. Here though he really gets to do very little, he certainly was taking the job hoping (and getting) a hit film so he could go off to make his more personal Hitchcock rip off films ( don't get me stated) anyway he doesn't get to work much style into Mission. Final sequence on the train in the tunnel is the first of many abusive unconvincing CGI action scenes that have followed and dominated American movie making. I don't mean to get on a soapbox here this film is bad as a stand alone without trying to blame it for other bad films. Cruise is too into being serious to enjoy the film and the script (written and rewritten while they were shooting) doesn't not hold together, leaving Cruise looking rather silly for playing it so seriously rather than with a ""isn't this fun? Don't take it too seriously"" attitude that might have saved at least him. The film was a hit, feel free not to listen to me, or feel free to actually watch this film as a film and see how poor it is. For those who see Brian DePalma's cinematic stealings from other films as being his expression of style, this time around he most effectively steals the hanging on wires gag from Topkaki. Unfortunately he needed to steal some scenes from about 10 other good movies to help out the rest of this one. Most exciting moment in the film is when they briefly play the original theme music--that moment leads into the Topkaki riff. If you were on a desert island and only had this film and its sequel to watch, I'd say watch this one, otherwise use them both to burn to make black smoke to attract rescue.",Mission - Impossible
131,Offworld_Colony,"Inarguably the classiest, most deceptive and downright creepiest of the Mission Impossibles.",9,12 February 2020,"Watching Ethan Hunt unravel and then gain control is a tour de force performance and the smooth old Hollywood spycraft with its split diopters and German expressionist angles is blended with the action chops of a helicopter chase through a train tunnel to spectacular effect. While the new Mission Impossible films are a perfect pinnacle of what action films could/should be now, DePalma's Mission Impossible was something unique when it was released, something special. That scene at Liverpool Street where Ethan sits opposite his villain and figures his plan while placating him with lip service is a dynamite moment.
It's intriguing, technically savvy and with great actors, stunts and effects. Mission 1 set the standard and it still holds up.
Impossible Mission: The Langley heist is clear with a simple transaction in one stimulating location with a good ensemble effort. Likely due to the lack of audio, it's a tense, fun and memorable mission.",Mission - Impossible

This one, as you all know is a remake of a popular 50's tv show.  Cheesy Tom Cruise hams his way through this movie, like he does in most of his other movies.  There are a few good scenes were the special effects are extraordinary, but they cannnot make this movie worthwhile.  Jean Reno irritates me, possibly because he has made so many other bad movies(Rollerball, The Professional, Ronin).  Ving Rhames is kinda cool in a very small role as another agent. Overall, just another boring, poorly acted attempt at a good movie.  Skip it, unless you are a huge action buff.  ** out of *****.",Mission - Impossible
133,willcundallreview,A not so good start to the super spy series,5,2 August 2015,"Mission: Impossible, the start of the worldwide famous series of well, impossible seeming missions. This start is one I didn't feel so well about, maybe even sloppy. Brian De Palma directs and I didn't like it so much, I didn't even find Tom Cruise a quality I expect from him, for me this was disappointing. The movie isn't without it's thrilling moments and occasional parts where you think ""Oh cool"", but all in all a fairly average tale.The plot is a slight bit of a mess, not well thought out and even though as said moments are thrilling, the actual basis of it all is fairly strange and kind of hard to keep up with at times. I think Cruise as super spy Ethan Hunt is OK but he never gives it his all, he acts a bit too underwhelming and then overwhelming and can't seem to work out how to act certain situations. As for the rest of the cast we see Jon Voight playing the character of Phelps, now Phelps could have been a very intriguing person but Voight manages to bring him down a peg and he becomes almost lifeless in the role.De Palma is the wrong choice of director, I mean this is in hindsight for me and although he manages to get through the action scenes OK, he never kicks it up a notch and makes some scenes rather bland. As for that action it is OK throughout but some effects can ruin it, not to mention insane stunts which you will see toward the end of the movie. I liked the cinematography, it's nicely done and one thing that sticks out in this, well worked camera positions and also one thing to mention, good locations.I think to be fair if your looking for spy movies there are better one's out there than this one. Mission: Impossible only serves to show how 90's spy movies were done, crazy gadgets that seem insane and characters that are just impossibly two faced. That all said I would recommend this, in fact most others who I have seen talk about this movie usually talk of it's bad story but the action quota and stunts more than make up for it, I kind of agree but don't think it makes up for it's negative points.And what of Cruise?, what of all the sequels?(surely this can't be bad with so many after it), well the truth is I can see why the sequels were made. The whole set up isn't bad and even the plot although silly is still unique, this one for me is a blemish but that doesn't mean more like this just better, can't be good. Tom Cruise is a mega star of film and one actor instantly known across the globe, put his face on one of these and throw in him doing his own stunts, and you have yourself a franchise.Overall I felt slightly disappointed by this movie, although not fully disheartened by it's trying. I know many many people will enjoy this and I do feel this is one of the highest average kind of movies I have seen, so close to being OK. If you can look past the crazy plot and partly bad acting you may love this, oh and add in the insane stunts as well to try and bypass. One last thing to mention here is the writing, oh and it's also not that good, in fact this entire movie is kind of 50/50 all round, some good parts some bad but the script by David Koepp and Robert Towne is a particularly good example of this.",Mission - Impossible

While all this is going on, he must find the true mole in his agency that set him up.Mission: Impossible is the perfect film for anyone who enjoys a good spy movie. The plot is quick and to the point. It never lets up for a minute. Unfortunately when it comes to spy movies, I'm left stumped with some of the details. With Mission: Impossible, even though they talk about things that are hard for the layman to understand, it can be easily figured out before the end of the film. But who cares anyway? The action scenes are amazing, particularly the famous sequence of Ethan Hunt dangling from a ceiling and catching a sweat droplet so it doesn't trigger the alarm. Since I'm young, I never had the pleasure of watching the TV show, but if it was anything like this movie, I'm sure I'd truly enjoy it.All the roles in the film are played very well. I particularly enjoyed the fact that Ethan Hunt's team is made up of well established actors such as Jon Voight, Emilio Estevez, and Kristen Scott Thomas. You're saying, ""Great cast.

So with the mission impossible six being announce and in pre production and with been twenty years after its release, I though it was high time to review this flick.To start does it hold up with the standards of the action movies nowadays? Yes, definitely and it is even better than a lot of them and even some superhero movies(superhero movies don't count as action flicks). The reason for that is not only it set the stage for spy movies to be more adrenaline fueled and give us spies who aren't just a copy of James Bond, but also it renewed the running man formula, that Harrison Ford made with the Indiana Jones, for real with so much running no wander why Tom Cruise look so young!One more thing is that the story isn't over the top but some what grounded in this world and so despite the lower stakes, the danger is more personal and show you get invested to the characters, who are also very well written and portrayed. In short although it hasn't the greatness of the Golden Eye, which came out one year earlier, I believe that it has a greater impact in cinema than this, just ask any regular film goer and he or she is more likely to have seen Mission Impossible than Golden Eye.Bonus fact the jokes for it are freaking hilarious like : "" Franchise Unkillable"" ,""We will continue seeing sequel, up until Tom Cruise quiets"", "" Cardio Cruising"" and so on!! ha ha ha!In the end Ithan Hunt is a great alternative for James Bond( or even his son for as we know 007 had a weakness for women) and don't say thinks like ""Is just a copy of 007"" for it isn't, like Bourne after words ,just continues the spy tradition and it doesn't make spies around the world feel shame for their work.",Mission - Impossible
141,SonicStuart,One of the best action films of the 1990's!,8,26 July 2004,"Rated PG-13 for Intense Action ViolenceGenre: Action/Adventure/Mystery/ThrillerStar Rating: **** out of 5This film is based on the classical CBS TV-series that ran from 1966-1973.This film is also a remake from another movie that came out in 1988 called Mission Impossible but this is a more updated version. The show's Jim Phelps (Jon Voight) is the leader of the 'Impossible Missions Force.'In this 'episode,' Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is the point man for an IMF mission to catch a spy in the act of stealing information about the 'covers' of many other covert operatives. In the tradition of the TV show, the viewer is led down many plot twists, turns, and reversals, while the IMF members employ the latest in technology, disguises, and spy gadgetry to accomplish their mission. This movie has a much of memorable scenes and quotes like one memorable scene was the ending part with the fight on the train and going in and out the tunnel! Another part was when Ethan Hunt was inside that room stealing the data without being seen and being pulled down by rope. There is also a sequel to this film entitled Mission Impossible 2 and in the sequel to Mission Impossible 2, Tom Crusie is also the producer of the Mission Impossible sequel.BOTTOM LINE: A GREAT SPY FILM!",Mission - Impossible

143,TheHonestCritic,"This movie is the beginning of a major franchise. But, is it a good first impression?",6,28 April 2020,"""Mission: Impossible"" (1996), this is the first ""Mission: Impossible"" movie based off the original TV series. For the most part, making movies based off of old TV shows is hit or miss. In this case..... Well..... It's complicated. Let's start with the negative stuff first and get that out of the way. First off, the story concept is a decent one. However, there are some parts where it drags on a little bit, and for the most part it is a bit overproduced. The storyline is easy to follow, but it does not come without slow parts or flaws. My personal favorite scene in this movie is where Ethan Hunt, played by Tom Cruise, has to sneak into the CIA building in Langley, Virginia to acquire the NOC list. That scene makes the movie worth watching. Even though I've watched that scene several times, it still puts me on the edge of my seat! The acting ranges from good, to standard. Of course, Tom Cruise steals the show as Ethan Hunt. Jon Voight is fairly standard as the villain. Ving Rhames is great as usual playing Luther. The rest of the cast is just standard, in my opinion. Now for the good elements of the movie. The special effects are well-done, and hold up to this day. All of the sets/locations give the movie a good atmosphere and set the tone. Finally, the soundtrack is decent. Not great, but decent. It does it's job and helps to tie the movie together. In the case of this film, three of the five elements I look for in a movie are good to marginal. As you know, a three star rating is where I draw the line between a movie being good or bad. This movie had some potential to be excellent, but it's overall just sloppy. Overall, I consider this to be a marginally bad movie. Now, it's not the worst film in the franchise. But, it's still somewhat tolerable to a certain extent. At the end of the day, I give this movie 3 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 6 out of 10 IMDB stars. My advice: if you're a fan of the original TV show, and you start with this movie, you may be disappointed. I recommend starting with my personal favorite; ""Mission: Impossible III"" (2006). My second favorite: ""Mission: Impossible-Ghost Protocol"" (2011). My third favorite: ""Mission: Impossible-Fallout"" (2018). Also, my fourth favorite: ""Mission: Impossible-Rogue Nation"" (2015). All four of those movies I consider to be perfect, in my opinion. But, if you still wish to see the first ""Mission: Impossible"" film, go ahead. Don't say I didn't warn you! This review will self-destruct in five seconds.",Mission - Impossible
144,shanayneigh,Still the best one in the franchise,9,11 April 2020,"I first saw this movie at its gala premiere, and was blown away. I have watched it several times since, and just rewatched it in 2020. It's far superior to its sequels - which are not bad movies, they're just not as good as the first one. The sequels are by now fairly generic action movies, the ingenuity, which the first movie has in spades, is pretty much out the window by now. In the later sequels I couldn't even tell you what the story is about without cheating, because the story doesn't matter, it's just an excuse to tie action set pieces together. Although I hadn't seen the first one in years I could still tell you what the story is about. I saw the latest one just a few months ago and I couldn't tell you the story if my life depended on it. And for all the sound and fury of the sequels where Cruise et al up the ante with every new installment, no sequence in any of the movies has been as thrilling as the nine minute almost completely silent wire sequence in the first one.",Mission - Impossible

I do not know why they even bothered to name it after the television show.",Mission - Impossible
147,mnpollio,A rather dull adaptation,4,12 June 2009,"Film adaptations of beloved TV shows are a dime a dozen and it is not hard to determine the diamonds (The Untouchables, The Fugitive, Charlie's Angels) from the lumps of coal (pretty much everything else). Given that Brian DePalma is the guiding force behind The Untouchables and the very structure of the TV show Mission: Impossible opens many avenues that one could explore with a large budget, a talented cast and the big screen, one certainly can be forgiven for keeping an open mind. Unfortunately, the end result is roughly 1-2 large scale action sequences surrounded by pure tedium. There is a lot of blame to go around for the end result, which burned up the box office and inspired two sequels (so far), but rarely if ever gets a mention on anyone's lists of favorite summer blockbusters. First, the storyline and characters are thoroughly uninteresting. For some reason known only to the screenwriters, the focal character is someone completely new, while the Jim Phelps character who led the TV series is shunted into support. The film allows absolutely no time to get a feel for the IMF team and how they work as our initial introduction to them is during a mission that turns into a disaster, leaving the majority of the team dead due to an obvious traitor. Naturally, the powers that be assume the traitor is the ""lone survivor"" (Tom Cruise), but we subsequently learn that another team member survived the melee (Emmanuelle Beart), so the two go on the run to steal a list of covert agents from the government to draw out a spy kingpin, who they hope will force the hand of the traitor and expose him/her (or some such thing). Like the TV show, there are a few twists and turns, double-crosses and reversals. Unlike the TV show, none of them are particularly surprising or involving. The cast looks better on paper than its plays out on screen. Kristin Scott-Thomas and Emilio Estevez are in the film for barely more than an eye blink before being dispatched. Lead Cruise is certainly up to the physical challenges of the role, but gives us no good reason to root for his character. He spends much of the film either blank-faced or glowering. Beart, as his co-hort and potential love interest, is lovely but listless. Jon Voight takes on the Jim Phelps role and pretty much contributes the same dull auto-pilot performance that he has reserved for his roles in popular entertainment for the last 20 years. Jean Reno is wasted as a later addition to Cruise's team, while Ving Rhames gets fed what few good lines there are and attempts to appear intimidating. Henry Czerny trots out a slightly starchier version of the uptight government official that he played in Clear and Present Danger. Meanwhile, more discerning viewers wait for the far-too-brief appearances of Vanessa Redgrave, who manages without breaking a sweat to make her fellow cast members appear laughable by comparison. DePalma, once known for some incredible set pieces, provides the film with stillborn pacing. He ratchets up the adrenaline in the final act in and on top of a speeding train, but prior to that we get one mildly amusing set piece with Cruise attempting a theft while suspended above the floor in a government building. Unfortunately, the scene goes on and on and on and on, ultimately losing whatever suspense and originality it may have initially possessed. These elements all culminate in a promising concept that misses its potential.",Mission - Impossible
148,flingebunt,"It might be a failure, but they failed trying",5,19 June 2005,"Probably the best way to understand what is right and wrong with this movie is to listen to the music. Based on the original TV series (and the bad 80s remake) Mission Impossible has the advantage of having one of the classics of lounge music associated with it. The problem is that the rest of the music is pretty bad, seeming to be there to fill in the gaps between when ""Mission Impossible Theme"" is to be played.So the plot is simple (there are some twists, but simple twists that will make you yawn). Ethan Hunt's team is wiped out on a mission to recover a list of spys and he is accused of being the turncoat. So what can he do, nothing except track down the real killer.This potentially intense drama is less than intense. Spy thrillers don't really work in the post cold war era, because the stories become about the break down of traditional loyalties.Yes this movie manages to transcend its plot, defining the idea of super secure computers (though the designers of the secure computer system should do a search on the internet for the ""evil overlord list"", especially the bit about making air vents too small for people to crawl through) and particularly how to break into secure environments. Of course, you only need to watch the trailer to see that bit.Not such a bad effort, takes the mission impossible idea to new places (whether you like it or not) and at the end of the day they failed trying. The roof top train chase, breaking into the supercomputer, the face masks, the betrayal, among other things, all are fascinating ideas, just poorly executed.Mission Impossible 2 is much better, though less idea driven.",Mission - Impossible
149,troyputland,Cruise and De Palma deliver the goods.,8,5 May 2015,"Tom Cruise and Brian De Palma deliver on so many levels with Mission: Impossible. It makes Pierce Brosnan's 007 era look dismal. The story is a complete maze full of gadgets, chaos, traitors and twists that's still as hard to comprehend the second, or even the third time round. De Palma has Cruise at the rudder of every scene, taking on an impossible mission to single handedly uncover the mole who betrayed him and his team. The organisation suspect him to be the rat, so choices are limited. From Prague to Washington and then to London, Ethan Hunt's hunt is cool, full of trust issues, face masks, Emmanuelle Beart's gorgeous agent trying to prove Hunt's innocence, tense set pieces and adrenaline fueled action. One particular nerve-racking scene sees Hunt infiltrating a secure vault with sound detectors and a touch sensitive floor. One of the tensest scenes in film history.",Mission - Impossible

The plot is really interesting, although it may seem confusing if we take our eyes off the screen for some seconds. Brian De Palma, one of my favourite directors, adds one more masterpiece to his career. The cast, leaded by Tom Cruise in a great role, has important names as Jon Voight, Jean Reno, Vanessa Redgrave, Emilio Estevez and Kristin Scott Thomas. Emmanuelle Béart is also great.

The fact Brian De Palma twisted Jim Phelps' (Jon Voight) character in the movie had some fans up in arms. Now that the films have progressed to three ventures of the Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) centric spy series, this is probably the best film out of the three Tom Cruise driven vehicles. It's also the most surprising and memorable of the three, particularly with Cruise floating above lasers and was good introduction to Ethan Hunt's background, and of the film series for non-fans of the original television series. I, too, was annoyed at the treatment of Jim Phelps, but now the films are just using the ""Mission Impossible"" to sell a Tom Cruise vehicle in playing Ethan Hunt- then this is the best one out of the three in hindsight, which is not really saying much. Great supporting cast include Ving Rhames, Jon Voight, Kristen Scott Thomas, Emilio Estevez. Nowhere near Brian De Palma's best directorial work, but nowhere near his worst either!

153,luke-a-mcgowan,"Mission Impossible is largely messy, but if you don't concentrate too hard and just soak up some gloriously directed and wonderfully tense moments, you'll have a great time.",6,12 August 2015,"I came out of Rogue Nation thinking ""damn that was good but I think the original is still in the classic"". Rewatching this now, I certainly think its the classic but by no means is it the best. There are plot holes in this movie that an aeroplane with Tom Cruise strapped to the side could fly through.Brian DePalma has a great style of directing this film. If I ranked the top 10 Mission Impossible franchise's best scenes, I think over half would be in this movie. Its tastefully understated in many places - not too over the top, and so much the better for it. No major gun battles in this film.Case in point, the film's iconic scene in the vault. Its so quiet the film could almost be a parody of 2001: A Space Odyssey. The cinematography as Cruise is lowered into the vault, and Rhames whispering hoarsely and nervously sets the mood perfectly. I almost died three times watching this scene - things as simple as a rat, a bead of sweat, and someone taking a pill could create so much adrenalin-fueled stress. DePalma moves all of his pieces skilfully into position to create maximum impact. I also give kudos to DePalma casting Academy Award nominee Kristen Scott Thomas and teen hearthrob Emilio Estevez in roles that were quickly killed off. The problem with movies these days is top billing of major stars is usually enough to spoil a movie - ""boy, I wonder if Samuel L. Jackson is going to die in Captain America 2"". Here, killing off Thomas and Estevez made second billed Voight's perishing believable - and his return later in the movie more shocking.I found Tom Cruise solid in this movie - he's not the best part of it like he is in other films, but he's a solid anchor for the rest of the cast. Jon Voight is solid where the screenplay lets him be - see one scene where Phelps turns to face Hunt and approaches him like a zombie (with Hunt appropriately freaking out) only for him to give a racking cough. The cough breaks the tension and confirms that he's alive. I loved that scene a lot. Ving Rhames, Vanessa Redgrave and surprisingly Henry Czerny steal every scene they are in, with the screenplays well written dialogue dripping from their lips with sly charisma. I could hear that trio talk to each other all day.However, Mission Impossible falls apart on its story, which has chunks carved out with wanton abandon. Jim Phelps guns down his wife not two minutes after we the audience learn that she was his partner in crime all along. Why? Because Ethan (acting of his own accord) revealed Jim's presence and she dared to speak? Notes say that a love triangle was cut out of this movie (which makes sense considering another awkwardly placed scene where Claire comes onto Ethan with no set up or payoff). DePalma should have probably realised the climax made no sense without it. Other plot holes: - its never fully explained why they have to go into the vault whilst Donloe is out of the room. Wouldn't it be easier to land on him and neutralise him, then take your time without worrying about heat, sound or pressure? - How did Ethan so quickly put together that Phelps was the villain? If they were supposedly so close why on earth was he so suspicious when Phelps fingered Kittridge? - How on earth did Ethan contact Max? Is there some magical email server where a domain name is whatever you want it to be? - What on earth did Kittridge mean when he suggested that he and Max would work out a compromise? I thought Max was the most wanted?Mission Impossible is largely messy, but if you don't concentrate too hard and just soak up some gloriously directed and wonderfully tense moments, you'll have a great time.",Mission - Impossible

The trailer looked awesome, and I can't believe I never touched the series, so I started off with the first (of course!) and got ready to plunge my mind into the world of impossible. The first one... in my opinion, was good. Nothing more to it. What brought me by surprise is it's intelligence and some sort of visible style. The film is highly complex, and builds up on pure intensity and some weird filming technique. Another surprising quality was it's slow movement. The action is there, but is shots are varied and surely spread apart. In fact, there are about 4 action scenes throughout the film (which I didn't expect) but it isn't a problem. The movie begins seriously interesting, and the complexity and filming gives it some weird feeling throughout. I would never call the film bad (as much do) but those people only expected action and nothing more. I expected action, but nothing near to the amount of build-up it presented. So the tag line sells it, you expect the impossible. The film doesn't rely on action sets and whatever comes after, it brings intellectual sense onto and presents it nicely. If the series continues to give this impression, Ghost Protocol should seriously deliver. If people could understand this film is not purely based on ACTION, this would probably get a more deserving score. Mission: Impossible is the best way to make a spy film; intelligent plot, complexion, and intense sprawled action scenes throughout. See this film with caution, and expect the impossible.

156,carlos37andre,Definitely a milestone in the action/suspense genre (but is not perfect),7,5 February 2018,"Sometime ago I realize that I never saw the first Mission Impossible Trilogy, two years ago I saw Rogue Nation and loved, so I'm looking forward to see the rest of the movies.Well, this movie is great, is definitely different than the sequels that we're getting now, but is without doubt one movie that influence a dozen of other action movies and franchises. The suspense through the entire movie is great, the surprises on the script really caught me off guard. The death of all Ethan's crew, the fact that Jim is the asshole at the end, and not the CIA boss. By the way, I love the way that DePalma shows us that Ethan knows the true, the scene is just gorgeous. I think that overall the actors are very good here, only Emmanuelle Béart didn't sound good sometimes. The most of the action scenes are truly breathless, in fact, that aren't a lot of ""ordinary action scenes"" (like two guys fighting), the director choose to do something that relies on the suspense itself, to leave you breathless. The heist scene is great, the soundless fact was a really clever idea.Overall, I think that my only big issues with the movie are the dated aspects. Like, why they have to use Chroma Key on the scene that are inside a car? Just, why?The internet aspect isn't a real issue, but is funny to see the perception they have of it. And the train scene is probably my big issue, does not hold up well, I get the time that it was made and all that kind of stuff, but just doesn't hold up, and, with that, I think that the weight that it was supposed to have didn't work for me. It's still a good action scene, all the ""air"" aspect is great, but, the CGI degrees its grade. Oh, I almost forget it: The score! My god the score! This is probably the most iconic thing of the franchise, and it is amazing, one of the best action movies score.Overall, Mission Impossible is a great movie, that definitely inspires (till today) a lot of action directions, such as Bourne Identity and Matrix.

157,rparham,It's not Impossible to like this film,7,8 June 2006,"With the trend that began in the early 1990's to adapt old television series into major motion pictures, Mission: Impossible was one of the many added to the list. Premiering in the late 1960's, Mission: Impossible was hit series for CBS for seven seasons and brought actors such as Peter Graves and Martin Landau to popular stardom. In 1996, superstar Tom Cruise collaborated with director Brian de Palma to bring the modern film version to life, and despite some critical drubbing at the time, Mission: Impossible proves to be one of the better television to motion picture adaptations to grace the screen to date.Mission: Impossible, the series, was very much in the same mold of the modern police procedural Law & Order: it was almost exclusively plot driven. Sure, the same characters reappeared episode after episode, but none of them were ever fleshed out or significantly developed. The series was exclusively interested in telling it's tale of a team of U.S. spies using subterfuge, theatrics and make-up to confuse and confound their mark and obtain their goal. With Tom Cruise in the lead of the film version, it seemed unlikely that this format would hold, and while the film does give a little more depth to it's leads, it is still pushed along by the tale more than the people.The film opens in Prague, where the Impossible Missions Force (IMF) have gathered to perform their latest mission: to prevent a double-agent from selling off a list of the secret identities of covert agents operating in Europe. The team is comprised of leader Jim Phelps (Jon Voight), key man Ethan Hunt (Cruise), electronics expert Jack Harmon (Emilio Estevez), Sarah Davies (Kristin Scott-Thomas), Hannah Williams (Ingeborga Dapkunaite), and Jim's wife, Claire (Emmauelle Beart). Part way through the mission, things begin to go horribly wrong, and before the night is out, all members of the team except Hunt are killed by an apparent assassin. Hunt contacts the head of his division, Eugene Kittredge (Henry Czerny) and discovers that the whole mission was designed to capture a suspected mole in the agency, and since Hunt was the only one who survived, he is labeled the mole.Hunt escapes capture and is determined to prove his innocence. With the discovery that Claire did not die during the mission, Hunt makes contact with an arms dealer named Max (Vanessa Redgrave) who the real mole was dealing with and makes his own deal: he will secure the information that Max wants if Max promises to deliver the real mole to him. Hunt recruits former members of the IMF who were discovered during previous missions and had to be ""disavowed' by the U.S. These include super hacker Luther Stickle (Ving Rhames) and helicopter pilot Franz Krieger (Jean Reno). Together, the group plans their heist, but things quickly become complicated and not everything with this whole operation is as it seems.At the time of it's release, Mission: Impossible was criticized for being so complicated as to be undecipherable, and while it is indeed complex, it is not impossibly so. The film does weave a complicated plot and requires the audience's attention, but that is actually one of the film's strengths. It doesn't proceed in an entirely normal manner, hitting all the usual beats you would expect from a Mission: Impossible story, so while it follows the formula to a degree, it also manages to stand that formula on it's head. If the film does fall short, plot wise, it is principally in one area involving a central twist to the story. From the moment the backstory for this twist is introduced early in the film until the plot finally reveals it, there is nothing terribly surprising about it. The final scenes of the film do suggest that it is not what it would seem to be, but even still, the fact that so major a plot element in a film that is supposed to be a suspense thriller is so easily deduced is a bit of a let down.Mission: Impossible is also not an action film in the literal sense. There is one major action set piece, but it is late in the film's running time, and up until then, the film has had no major car chases or fisticuffs. It replaces those with one major sequence of suspense, in which Ethan Hunt must attempt to retrieve information from a computer in a room littered with sensing equipment, including pressure sensitive floors, temperature controls and audio sensors. This sequence, played largely without dialogue and no music, is effective in building tension and literally putting you on the edge of your seat.Mission: Impossible is not really an actor's movie. All the leads, from Cruise on down, are competent and do their jobs well, but nobody really takes hold of your attention. Cruise is his usual suave self, Rhames is entertaining as Luther Stickle, and Reno is appropriately shady as Kreiger. There is the suggestion of a possible romance between Hunt and Claire, but there isn't much chemistry between the two.Mission: Impossible isn't a great film, but it is a good, effective one. It does require the audience pay attention and, emotionally, it doesn't pack a whallop, but it is good summer popcorn entertainment.",Mission - Impossible

163,Jared_Andrews,Stylish Spy Thriller,7,31 July 2018,"I went back and watched this movie after seeing the most recent three M:I films. That certainly puts me at a strange perspective, since I saw the movies out of order and this one more than twenty years after it was released. No doubt, I have been spoiled by the excellent improvements in special effects and stunt execution in movies of the past 20 years. Going back to watch the old one is a step down in some respects. But, I was delighted to find how well this movie holds up. The action sequences and special effects still look excellent, and the thrills and suspense have stood the test of time.A lot of credit needs to go to director Brian De Palma. He makes this movie very much about style and momentum. The alluring vibe is the movie's strength, and it definitely takes the focus. This is only borderline an action movie. It's more of a cool spy thriller. Ethan Hunt has not yet become the famous super spy that we know in later films. Here he is very much a part of a team. At first, he is presented merely a grunt work man. His smirk and cocky jokes suggest that he doesn't take the matters all that seriously.Throughout the film, he slowly reveals himself to be sharp, acutely aware of his surroundings and smarter than everyone else in the room. Not until the third act do we fully realize how stellar Hunt is at this work. He figures out who set him up and how they did it, which is a miracle because this plot is largely incomprehensible. Ethan Hunt may be the only person in the movie or watching the movie to understand what the heck is going on. There are so many betrayals and double crosses that it's nearly impossible to know which characters are working together. And yet, the film still works. Viewers will eventually understand who is the hero and who he must defeat to save the lives of many innocents. Understanding the plot on that level, is all you really need.This movie seems to have improved with age, and I imagine the critic scores would improve upon a re-watch. It's worth your time.",Mission - Impossible
164,robsta23,A Decent Action Film,7,5 July 2015,"To me a film becomes boring if it becomes predictable - especially if what was predictable was supposed to be a huge twist for the film. Even though I sometimes write spoilers I'm not going to spoil who the villain of the film is (I knew in the first 15 minutes of the film) but that doesn't really matter since it is so easy to figure out.I noticed that this film set a lot of precedents for action films made after this film. For example, if you have seen the first Spider-man film with Tobey Maguire then you probably remember the scene where Peter's single drop of blood signals Osbourne to become suspicious of his environment, and it is a very tense, simple scene. Well, in Mission: Impossible, Tom Cruise is breaking into a room which will sound an alarm if the tiniest amount of weight is added to the room, even a drop of water, and Cruise starts sweating, and the scene becomes tense when a single drop of sweat is about to fall from the glasses he is wearing.This movie seems to think it is being overly smart which gets annoying when you realize the story is pretty simple. Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is on a mission at the start of the movie that goes haywire and results in the death of most of his team members. Somebody who is higher up than Hunt in this business calls him to a meeting immediately, where Hunt learns they think he is a traitor, so he has been set up. The plot then focuses on Hunt trying to contact the actual mole in the agency by referencing a specific bible verse from the book of Job (something was mentioned about a ""job"" in his initial meeting with the executive) and in my mind it is kind of confusing how he knows exactly what to say and who to e-mail to try to find the mole. It becomes like speaking in riddles and I do not think the movie needed to be this ""smart"" when its purpose was to be a fun action movie.Towards the end of the film, the CGI is just plain terrible in the climactic action sequence. Not to say that the action itself is not fun, but it just breaks the illusion of the film and you realize you're watching a movie (a movie should allow you to get lost in it). This is especially noticeable when Cruise's character flies towards the camera at one point, and you notice that the Cruise coming at you is computer generated for two thirds of the jump. The one effect I was astounded by, however, was the use of masks in the film - I'm not sure if the masks were real masks, but damn, they were elaborate masks that copied exactly how other characters in the movie looked, and I have to say bravo.I didn't enjoy this action movie since it wasn't as fun for me as other action movies, but perhaps this is your type of action movie; who am I to say?",Mission - Impossible
165,seawalker,"Disgraceful, drivel, terrible (spoilers)",2,24 June 2001,"This was a Tom Cruise spy film.  Unfortunately it was not a ""Mission: Impossible"" film, and that was my problem.The overall most important element of the TV series was the plot - the heist, the robbery, the fraud, the trickery, the whatever...  The team (the brain, the girl, the technician, the muscle and the actor) in effect were only there to move the plot forward.  But, saying that, we really got to know and trust these anonymous agents; a tribute to such  excellent actors as Peter Graves, Martin Landau and Leonard Nimoy.  The first thing that this film does is kill off the team.  Disgraceful!  And then various members of the new team he puts together turn out to be traitors.  Drivel!  And then at the end of the film they completely trash the reputation of TV's greatest spy master Jim Phelps.  Terrible!  Sorry, but this is not the film that I wanted to see.It says a lot that according to rumour the producers did not see fit to offer any of the original cast members of ""Mission: Impossible"" so much as even a silent cameo in this movie.

171,jdollak,"Holy cow, this has aged horribly",4,27 March 2011,"I remember seeing this movie in the theater. After that, I saw it at least once on VHS, maybe twice. I picked up the blu-ray of this, used from a Blockbuster that was closing. I've been more interested in seeing spy/action movies recently, and it seemed like something I should revisit.I wish I hadn't bought it.There are so many problems with this movie, nearly all of which have to do with the script.First, I don't care about anyone on the team. Cruise doesn't come across as having a personality, and he doesn't behave like a skilled agent. Everyone else in the cast seems to be disposable. Second, the plot had potential to be an interesting story, provided that the story was treated a little more like the A-Team, with them trying to prove their innocence. Instead, we wind up with a story where we aren't positive why Cruise is doing anything, except for some vague idea, and it comes across confusing, because it's hard to draw a line between his actions and his goal. Third, because of the first two, I find myself having no sense of tension or investment in the outcome of the movie. I couldn't care less if Cruise lives or dies.The movie hasn't aged well. The pacing is strange, and once again, computers are relegated to be magic boxes. And the action sequences seem to be... silly. When Cruise leaps from the exploding fish tank, I couldn't keep from laughing. The big finish fight with the train and the helicopter was not up to the same level of silliness, but it was very, very close.Now I have to figure out what to do with this blu-ray copy that I really will never look at again.",Mission - Impossible

This movie came out the year I was born, and my parents watched it while I was an infant. They told me they fell asleep during it. I finally watched the movie myself when I was 13, and I must say, I can see why.This movie is mostly just a snooze-fest. The plot is very convoluted with a very predictable twist and the slow pace makes it even harder to get into. The lack of action for most of the running time also makes it really boring.It really takes off in the final 10 minutes, however. The climax on the train is as exciting as it gets and practically saves the film.Tom Cruise was good as Ethan Hunt. He certainly knows how to be the man of action. Many the supporting performances are also good. It's just a shame they didn't have a more coherent script to work with.Overall, I was extremely disappointed.

But what it lacks is still some of the realism that is at least apparent in the original series. Too much stuff here is simply impossible to believe, like that helicopter in the tunnel.

Looking forward to seeing Rogue Nation further down the road this year, and having seen Ghost Protocol and enjoying it, I still say with enormous confidence that the first Mission is still to be beaten and maybe the fifth will do it, but I will talk about that another time. Getting back to the point at hand, this movie truly delivers thrills like no other and an incredibly twisted story that keeps you guessing and guessing. Tom Cruise really nailed a role of a lifetime here as he begins to give us Ethan Hunt, a spy that gets more and more iconic status as he is associated with the likes of Bourne and the top spy himself Bond. But the movie succeeds on a lot more levels than this, ranging from the supporting cast to the screenplay and direction. This is a franchise I very much enjoy (even the maligned MI2), but this is the standard bearer of the series and the more espionage driven movie of them all.

175,AnishMisra,Mission Impossible Review,8,20 July 2018,"Mission: Impossible is a film directed by Brian de Palma. I have seen this film one time before. But I again decided to see it since I wanted to go into the intricacies of this venture. And I was stunned.Plot: Ethan Hunt, an IMF agent is on the run from his superiors for killing his team and stealing a NOC list.Story and direction: This film is more of a thriller film than an action one, which was very rare at the time at which it released. This is what impressed me the most. The story is very intriguing and for every second of the film you feel the tension mounting. The complaint heard mostly from this film is that you can't move away from the screen even onece as you may miss something. But I genuinely don't see that as a flaw. Don't the people who invest in the movies want the audience to put their whole focus on the movie itself? The characters and their story are also very interesting. In the initial scenes itself, you care for Ethan Hunt. He worries about the safety of his agents and his country and that was very beautifully shown. The score by Danny Elfman works wonders. In some scenes, there is total silence as the director wants to tap on the tension. This shows that Brian de Palma is in love with his work. The action scenes are minimal in this one, but they are great. They feel real even 22 years later. But the film had one minor flaw for me. It was the VFX in the climactic battle. It looked like blue/green screen work in the background which made me cringe a bit. Performances: Tom Cruise's image changed overnight just because of his character, Ethan Hunt. I just loved him. He lived each and every moment in the film. Who could have tought of a big bald, plumpy black guy like Ving Rhames as a hacker? Not me. He just was great and did provide some comic relief in the film. Jon Voight is awesome. So were Vanessa Redgrave and Jean Reno. Henry Czerny is the kind of boss that just doesn't have a clue as to what's going on and I loved that. I had a small issue with Emmanuelle Beart's casting. She still happens to retain her French accent, which is never explained in the film.Favorite Scene: It would be the scene where Luther, Krieger, Claire and Ethan are on a train to the US and Ethan explains as to what they are about to do. The tension is what gave me goosebumps as it just happens to explain the following scene. Also, the thing done well was showing Ethan's confidence and Luther's doubt in the mission.Verdict: This film marked the beginning of a great franchise which boasted not only goo stunts but also good character development and things that are still remembered even 20 years after. I applaud Brian de Palma and team for bringing such a film to the screens.I am going with an 8.5/10.",Mission - Impossible
176,schroeder-gustavo,One of the Most suspenseful action movies,8,23 July 2015,"Mission: Impossible is directed by Brian DePalma and was released in 1996. Almost 20 years after the movie's initial release, I am very glad to say the movie still holds up very well for the most part, which is not always easy especially for action movies, since they are almost always heavy on special effects.This was the movie in which Tom Cruise showed the world that he could be an action star and how much he actually encouraged doing his own stunts. He owns the role of Ethan Hunt and gives an incredibly charismatic performance. The directing and cinematography is still pretty solid, although the movie suffers from a very big flaw that is pretty common in spy movies: the plot is convoluted, sometimes even messy. By the end of the movie, director Brian DePalma really tries to tie up loose ends, but doesn't fully accomplish it. It's just a very hard plot to follow and, in the end there's just more confusion.But aside from that, I believe Mission: Impossible is a very good movie, which set the standards high in the series. There are two scenes in this film that are by far some of the most suspenseful scenes I have ever seen. I'm talking about the scene in the restaurant with Hunt and Kittrige and the scene where they steal the disk in the IMF headquarters. In the second one, the lack of music and just silence for almost the entire duration of the scene really pays off, and increases the suspense.Mission: Impossible is a movie that could have easily been a lot better if they had just put the plot together more tightly than the end result, but overall, it is a very strong first entry in a successful series.",Mission - Impossible

There is no denying Tom Cruise works his magic here in a movie that seems tailor made for his screen presence. Having a few of the scenes stick in the mind can also be considered a good thing. For I will always remember him hanging from a wire in the middle of that completely pressure and sound sensitive white room. So that is that.

OK the man basically did the Untouchables, Scarface, wise guys, Carlitos Way, Carrie, casualties of war!!! Many people judge a director by the work as a whole, not the history of his all works, diversification, and elements of one work. Well if you focus on these three elements, you will find from the movies I named above that De Palma has done it all! Let us see: Mission Impossible I was the best of all three and it was the only one directed by De Palma. The second was directed by John Woo and the third by J.J.Abrams. If you watch the second you will see a touch of face/off from Woo but nothing that teases your brain. If you watch the third, well nothing is good about it. However, the first one is a movie that almost everyone I know who watched it the first time wasn't capable of understanding the plot quite properly! It's one of the very few action movies that requires full attention and respect to the plot. We all know action movies' plots! So, anyone who didn't like this movie is simply one that didn't understand the plot with its minutest details that need a proper viewing. De Palam, hats off to you for you master any work you put your hands on.If you like brain teasers, if you appreciate great directors, if you enjoy plots that put your wit to test, then Mission Impossible I is the right movie for you.",Mission - Impossible

The deaths of all the characters at the start was something I felt like was a much needed plot twist and really added to the weight of the moments. I also like the final battle as well as the rag tag team that Tom Cruise had made. The reveal with Jon Voight is something I can see why people would not like, but it was really good in the context with the rest of the movie. Overall this movie is great and I give it a full ten out of ten",Mission - Impossible
182,Panterken,"Cool, classy and fun spy thriller with great direction by De Palma and a killer soundtrack.",8,15 March 2008,"'Mission Impossible', based on the eighties TV format with the same name, is as classy and fun as spy-thrillers get. It's filled with enough twists and turns to make your head spin and the acting is more than solid overall, a common complaint when dealing with action-movies. Back in 1996 it was a huge hit and it's no surprise shortly after life was given to a sequel, the unfortunate MI2, perhaps the biggest mistake was leaving the project in the incompetent hands of John Woo. Slow motion and unrealistic fight sequences reign, and there's little left of the fun that made the first film so good. The third film wasn't a complete miss, the producers smart enough to hire a competent director and cast (the outstanding Philip Seymour Hoffman as the villain and an underused Laurence Fishburn).The first one in the series however is a glorious success on every level; on top of the clever plot we have a great soundtrack to support it and director De Palma has some very nice cinematographic tricks up his sleeve. I distinctly remember the great camera-work in the first action sequence (the set-up). Pay attention during the scene in the phone booth, how he elegantly uses the camera to evoke a sense of panic and claustrophobia. That's just one of the great surpluses De Palma always provides in any of his film.MI certainly isn't a typical film for the director, he's never really done this kind of slick action-movie before. I, and most of you, will primarily know him for gangster movies such as Scarface, Carlito's Way and The Untouchables but he's also responsible for Carrie, his best movie so far IMO. For those who do not know it, Carrie is a horror-drama, and a very good one too, so De Palma can pretty much handle every genre and he proves it yet again. The plot moves along very fast, fast enough so the most obvious plot holes aren't noticed. Clever as it may be, it's far from flawless and some of the action sequences aren't exactly state of the art anymore, action-movies will always age faster than any other genre I'm afraid. I'm thinking in particular of the legendary tunnel scene in the end, it all looked a bit too artificial compared to similar sequences in today's films. The above really isn't a flaw, films date, it's unavoidable. In the end, even after 12 years, Mission Impossible has not lost any of it's charm and with, I still get excited seeing it again and again, and fans of the genre who haven't yet should check out this film from an era where Tom Cruise wasn't Scientology crazy and at the top of his 'cool'. Because if MI were to be summarized in one word, I'd definitely be 'COOL' !!8.3/10",Mission - Impossible

This story is one you earn by devoting yourself to it. Tom Cruise in this is at his best and I love it, his only other better performance is in this film second installment M:I:2. This is where for me Cruise left his chick image behind and became a real actor. Brian De Palma does none of his signature frames in this movie but I believe that is because he realizes that this is a story that he did not create and that he is just there to film the story not make it his own.

187,rcolgan,Mission: Succeeded,8,19 August 2015,"In a time where a lot of classic TV shows were being given weak cinematic remakes (""The Flintstones"", ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" etc.), Mission Impossible overcame this negative trend by bringing in Brian De Palma do his own take of the series. With the gadgets of a Bond movie, the pacing of a Hitchcockian thriller, and the stunt work of a great American action movie, De Palma was able to breath new life into a classic show and begun one of the most enduring film franchises in recent memory. It stars Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, a professional spy, who along with his team accept a mission to retrieve an important file and catch the enemy agent who is attempting to steal it. But things begin to go gravely wrong, with Ethan seemingly left as the lone survivor. After this Ethan is suspected of being a double agent and goes on the run from his own agency, setting out to find the real culprit using whatever methods necessary to clear his name.Rather than going the route of more recent spy flicks like ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" that parodies the spy genre, ""Mission: Impossible"" does the exact opposite. Instead it indulges in all the clichés, with elaborate disguises, high tech gadgets, high octane explosions, double crosses, and many surprise twists. Although one problem with these twists is it's quite easy to poke holes in them, since they're often done with no foreshadowing and there's little logic behind the characters plans. But this never really matters, for this is a film that lives in the moment. These twists mostly exist to draw us further into the nail biting tension and succeed at doing so.In spite of De Palma arguably being best known for his iconic shootouts, such as the ending of ""Scarface"" or ""The Untouchables"" stair sequence, here our lead never fires a single gun. Instead of using standard action shoot ups or fist brawls, the film delivers tension with 3 unique action sequences: the opening infiltration of the ball room; the vault heist dangling from a wire on the ceiling in the middle of the film; and the final chase involving a helicopter following a high speed train into a tunnel. The ballroom sequence works as a brilliant introduction to this world of spies. We see the cool gadgets, their detailed plans and how similar to other great spies like Bond they keep a sharp wit whilst they do it. At the same time the scene remains unpredictable, with so many things going wrong that it's really uncertain of who will get out alive. Then comes the iconic vault heist where Hunt dangles from wires to steal data from a heavily secured vault. This scene has to stand as one of Palma's greatest contributions to cinema. It may take influence from other great heists like Jules Dassin's ""Riffi"", Palma still adds his own unique take on the concept. Largely by bringing so many great elements together in the scene with slow pacing, great stunt work from Cruise and the way that the scene juggles so many risks from the worker who could walk in at any moment to the sweat dripping from Hunt's head. Unfortunately the final sequence does not live up to the previous two. The basic concept is cool, with Cruise chasing the villains on top of a speeding train whilst a helicopter chases, but unfortunately it falls flat due to execution. Obviously with a scene like this CGI is a necessity, for actually having a helicopter following a train into a tunnel really would be impossible. But 90's effects just weren't ready to portray a sequence like this authentically. Also whilst the concept of a chase on a speeding train is great, adding in a helicopter just seems like overkill and draws attention to the scenes lack of realism in contrast to the previous tone of the film. Although even with this the chase is still entertaining on a basic level, but just fails to deliver the same tension of previous scenes. Besides this it's far from ruining the brilliance that preceded it, with Palma's brilliant execution mixed with the excitement of a great spy thriller allows ""Mission: Impossible"" to overcome all the usual expectations of a typical action movie, and is a heck of a lot of fun because of it.",Mission - Impossible

De Palma's direction is brilliantly stylised, that opening sequence is such a great way to start a film and the stunts are undeniably really impressive. Obviously there are more stunts in the later films, but they're still really impressive here. The cable scene (you know the one) uses suspense fantastically, and the final action sequence was really great. The score is also just the definition of iconic. I do think the twist that happens towards the end is kind of dumb, and there are some effects which don't hold up very well, but overall this is an enjoyable time, and it's made me fairly excited to check out the rest of the franchise.",Mission - Impossible

As time goes by, I wasn't sure if this movie would still hold up after looking up everyone's thoughts on the movie, especially the Jim Phelps twist that everyone hates. So I watched it, and I really don't think it was that bad. So the premise of the film is about Ethan Hunt, our main hero, who goes undercover to find out who has framed not only himself, but his team that were killed during their mission. While figuring it out, he also recruits some new team members while teaming up with Jim Phelps' wife Claire as they try to retrieve the IMF NOC list. So, basically, it plays out like a mystery movie as Ethan Hunt has to figure on who did this and why; its not really much of an action movie but I think the movie works on its own level as it plays very low key or a bit in your own opinion of the movie. Also, I have read that some of the original cast members of the original show and die hard fans were very upset that they made Jim Phelps the bad guy. I don't know if its actually a big deal, or what were they expecting for the movie as it first came out but I do know is that I have never watched the show nor have any knowledge to it whatsoever. Furthermore, I wasn't as upset as what the live action ""Scooby Doo"" movie did when they made Scrappy Doo the bad guy. So I guess you can say that I'm okay with Jim Phelps for being the bad guy, and I thought Jon Voight's performance was really good. The rest of the cast all did fine on their own, and I do say that Tom Cruise who is really good and also being awesome at the same time. I thought the direction that Brian De Palma did was incredibly well done. I really do admire the premise of the movie, and I do find it very Hitchcockian as it keeps you interest to know what is going on. The movie does have some very good suspenseful parts like the scene where Ethan Hunt is being hung on cables as they try to retrieve the list. I love Danny Elfman's music of the movie, and his arrangements of the ""Mission: Impossible"" theme. The final scene of the movie was alright because I kind of which if the helicopter wasn't CG so that it wouldn't had to be in a tunnel. There were parts that are real, while other parts were not. I guess they were trying to be safe, because it is understandable that using helicopters in movies can be dangerous but it is for what it is. The movie does have some good stunt work, but its Tom Cruise who is actually doing it all by himself. Some of the actors, were just replace with doubles as like what I just said about the final scene is just playing safe. When I look back at the sequels, I'm sure they do better than what this movie as when they are parts that took risks, while others not. I still respect this movie for being low key, but that is just my opinion. So, yeah, I actually still love ""Mission: Impossible"" and I don't think it was as bad as some of the negativity that I've read. It is a suspenseful film with a premise that keeps you interest. I give it an 8 out of 10.",Mission - Impossible
192,no-skyline,Thrilling Thriller,6,7 February 2006,"Brian De Palma delivers a kinetic live wire suspense filled espionage thriller to open the Mission Impossible franchise. The camera work is exceptional with De Palma's trademark sense of motion applied to suspenseful heists and an amazing train ride sequence during which you really get the sense of speed and danger. Also created is one of the most iconic images from any thriller of recent times Tom Cruise suspended mid heist inches from a pressure sensitive floor. Cruise lives up to his star billing and for me really nails the Ethan Hunt character, Jean Reno, Ving Rames and the stunning Emmanuelle Beart provide able support.My one problem with this film and unfortunately quite a big problem is that the twist in the tale can be seen coming a mile off. Which is a real shame as this film is inventive, fun, stylish and everything a main stream thriller should be.Fun but the twist in the tale doesn't have enough of a sting 7/10",Mission - Impossible
193,TheGreatMarkukini,A spy movie that constantly goes out of control,8,18 June 2019,"After decades of James Bond movies, the new promising franchise decided to arise and show something bold and more fast-paced. The result stunned me and gave a start for never-ending discussion about Tom Cruise's abilities as the actor and as a stuntman.Right of the bat it is worth noticing the cast of the initial mission. Tom Cruise, Jon Voight, Ving Rhames, Jean Reno and the list keeps on going. The teamwork is just gorgeous and the emotions fit to the situations as the final piece of the grand puzzle.I heard a lot about 'Mission Impossible' being a rip-off of the James Bond movies but with all respect the statement is completely wrong. The concept of the spies might be the same but then the similarities run out: incredible and convoluted teamwork that from time to time stops even your heart just not to disturb the air around the characters when the events go sideways. Impossible tricks reinforce that brave title and the attempt to have some plot twists deserves a pat on the shoulder. Oh, and what a soundtrack!All that mysterious and treacherous spy atmosphere is still flying around me, so I would like to say that the kick-off has been very successful. My attention is fully with Ethan Hunt now, who, for what it worth, in my eyes is standing higher than some of previously mentioned agents with a license to kill.",Mission - Impossible
194,smashattack,"Thrilling espionage, action, adventure, and mystery!",6,3 July 2002,"With Mission:  Impossible, the sky is hardly the limit.  An intricate plot with a great cast and excellent action and adventure.Tom Cruise plays as Ethan Hunt, who, like most of the IMF team, is new to the Mission:  Impossible story.  Jim Phelps is back as the leader of the IMF team.The plot revolves around the NOC (non-official cover) list, which contains the names of every single secret agent in Europe.  A mole, inside the CIA, is trying to get this list and it's up to the IMF team to keep the list from getting into the open.From there on the plot twists more and more and Tom Cruise delivers one of his best performances.  He is so perfect for this character, and the other cast members do very well in portraying their characters.  The storyline is great and hardly gets repetitive or boring, and the music, composed by Danny Elfman, is much better than Zimmer's M:I-2 composition.  Elfman gets the whole espionage sound, with the light drum cadences and quick beats that will help keep the movie in a strong suspense.There is no reference to sex, the violence is not overwhelming, and the language remains fairly decent.  It's a must see for all members of the family, since it's just a straightforward action movie that goes deeper than one would assume.This is one of my all-time favorites.  I would definitely recommend it.",Mission - Impossible

You can't hate this movie and yet you still can't call it a great thriller. It is a very good movie with charming and suave Tom Cruise. I have to say Cruise has done some very unique and vibrant movies in his career. Minority Report, Oblivion, A few good men, Edge of Tomorrow and many more.This movie was a little rushed and few points weren't made clear, but not much could ne added in 1:50. It could have been a little longer. I don't regret saying that I am a newbie for Mission: Impossible series as it was 2020, and I haven't even seen one. Well, now I did.

196,blairgallop7,The most Impossible of missions turned out to be the best,10,2 October 2007,"Out of all the Mission:Impossible movies,this is my favorite as instead of lots of action like the next two sequels,this one instead is more of a mystery/thriller and has the best plot out of the trilogy as it twists and turns so fast that you wouldn't even know who the main villain is. Tom Cruise stars as IMF Agent Ethan Hunt who after an operation gone wrong,he suddenly finds out he was framed for the murder of his five teammates by a mysterious individual known as Job 3-14(later revealed to be Jim Phelps who is played marvelously by Jon Voight who was the mastermind behind the botched operation and received help from Franz Krieger) but Hunt is instead led to believe it was Eugene Kittridge(played by Henry Czerny) who presumes that Ethan Hunt is the mole as he is the only surviving member of his team. Ethan then learns that Clair Phelps(Emmanuelle Beart)who is/was Jim Phelps' wife also survived the mission and then Ethan begins with correspondence with an individual known as Max which is probably short for Maxine as it is a woman(played by veteran actress Vanessa Redgrave). Max then tells Ethan to get her the Non-Official Cover(NOC) list for her in exchange for the identity of the mole(Jim Phelps) as the list stolen from the US Embassy in Prague was a fake and the real one is in the CIA Headquarters in Langley,Virginia which is outside Washington,D.C and then Ethan would need two people from the Disavowed list. Ethan would recruit Luther Stickell(Ving Rhames) and Claire would recruit Franz Krieger(Jean Reno) who would later be revealed to be assisting Jim Phelps. But besides the great cast of this movie and the complex,brain-teasing script,another great thing about this movie was the plot,stunts,special effects and the director Brian De Palma who directed such movies as Scarface,Carlito's Way and The Untouchables. Great job by everyone involved with this film and it is now one of my immediate favorite spy/action/thriller films.",Mission - Impossible
197,NikkoFranco,The best in the entire franchise,8,28 May 2018,"So our dear Mister Tom Cruise found himself a golden goose by making a franchise of their borrowed, highly successful title. However in all those 5 or 6 ? parts, the very best for me is the very first one. Why - because it has many unforgettable elements that are still being re-enacted in comic acts, satire, action etc. Also the cast is able to showcase that mystery , that air of suspense that isn't there anymore in the sequels . What happened is that everyone has shifted their expectations of a flawless story into flawless stunts. It became a victim of its own succcess, just like with many other blockbusters. Tom Cruise , with all his running here, there and everywhere, has been and always is eye candy. Jon Voight as the ultimate nemesis is no surprise as the man has plenty of character. Vanessa Redgrave as Max has to be crowned as the queen of scenestealing because she owned the character, Max and Max owned her.

I can start by saying that I was not a fan of the original series, so I'm not comparing it to anything... I just didn't like it. I found it very loud and confusing, way too intricate and convoluted plot-wise. I didn't care about any of the characters... that's usually the test I give a movie just before I turn it off in the middle: how would I feel if all these characters died in the very next scene? If the answer is that I wouldn't care one bit, I go ahead and turn it off, which is what I did here.The three stars are for the special effects, which looked pretty good but weren't enough to keep me interested for two hours.

Without these I would have been in some severe pain for the entire movie.Everything else in the movie, such as the script, acting and special effects seemed pretty packaged. It was a successful marketing venture, with excellent financial support which ensured huge gross earnings. No more, no less.

201,tstudstrup,Like watching a bad play.,1,24 February 2019,"Considering how truly awful this movie is, itys a miracle, it ever became a franchise. And I love these movies. Up untill now I've always thought the second movie was the worst one. They didn't truly get it right until the third movie, which is still the best in the franchise.But back to the one that started it all. It sucks. Plain and simple. First of all, there is no action for the first half an hour. The team actually sits around a table and talk about how bad the coffee is. And Ethan is shown how some plastic explosives is disguised to look like chewing gum.The movie is filled with these scenes where the characters talk and talk and talk. And then talk some more. And the way its filmed, its like watching a bad play.
When the action finally comes its done really bad. You know how Tom Cruise always does his own stunts on location? Well not in this one. It's clearly done in front of a green screen with a big windmachine. And it looks awful, even for a movie from 1996.Considering it was directed by Brian Palma, who can do action very well, this feels like some amateur made for tv movie with a very low budget.You get the feeling from the very beginning of the movie, that they didnt know how to make the movie. Like they just edited some scenes together in a way that doesnt make much sense. The badguys are cliche. And they dress in long trench coats and hats like its a movie from the 1960's.I really wanted to like this movie, but I can not think of a single good thing to say about it. Im just glad Tom Cruise later on gained control of the franchise and pushed it in the right direction with lots of action and great stunts and great stories and great acting.

202,andrewmerritt-31652,Good start to the Mission Impossible franchise,8,7 January 2019,"Mission Impossible is based off of a popular T.V. in the 60s until Hollywood decided to turn it into a franchise. In the first of the franchise we follow Ethan Hunt played by Tom Cruise as he is framed after his team gets killed after a plan goes wrong. I haven't seen the T.V. show so I can't compare the two, but if I did get around to watching the T.V. show I don't think I would make one bit of difference because I like what they've done with the franchise. This Mission Impossible felt like I just finished a Tom Clancy meets Robert Ludlum book. Because this is the first one in the franchise this movie we get to see what Ethan Hunt is and how he operates as this movie is very cloak and dagger and it doesn't feel long or tiresome at all. In fact I was really engrossed in the first ten minutes of the movie after the mission goes completely out of control and from there Ethan uses his spy skills and training to clear his name. The movie is also directed by Brian De Palma who directed Scarface and other movies. I think Brian read as many Tom Clancy and other spy novels as he could so he can get a refresher of how spies operate. Then he decided to take all that knowledge he had and put it in this movie. The middle half of the movie is where things start to heat up and that's where you'll be on the edge of your seat. I wont spoil it for you but you'll know what I'm talking about. Overall, I will say that this is a great start to the Mission Impossible franchise and I will review some more Mission Impossible movies in the future.",Mission - Impossible
203,darkjosh,Exciting and Surprisingly Intelligent,8,7 November 2000,"Mission:Impossible is a tightly scripted, taut, very suspenseful update of the old TV series that not only proves to be intelligent, but also has some adrenaline-pumping action sequences.Tom Cruise stars as Ethan Hunt, a member of the IMF whose team is killed in a bungled attempt to recover a list of the true identities of many secret agents.  When he meets with his agency, they suspect he is the culprit behind their killings and must flee to attempt to prove otherwise.Brian DePalma, a director known for providing involving, deeply rooted stories about conspiracies and ruthless factions, such as Scarface and Carlito's Way.  In a film that just screams for non-stop, mindless action sequences, shootouts, and explosions, DePalma instead delivers an involving, complex film with action sequences both quietly effective and amazingly intense, as well as a great performance from John Voight and a charming, likeable, and witty performance from Tom Cruise.  Danny Elfman's score is also effective in building tension throughout.While certainly not as breathtaking a thrill ride as other actioners, Mission:Impossible succeeds in delivering a satisfyingly complex, intriguing story and interesting, thoughtful, slick characters.  It may falter sometimes in implausability, but the engaging story allows the suspense of disbelief.  Thoroughly entertaining.8 out of 10",Mission - Impossible
204,saint405,"Don't worry about the plot, just go with the flow",7,15 June 2006,"Enter the mind of Ethan Hunt, a slick and clever spy working for the IMF. He's the James Bond of the new century, getting cool gadgets and working with a crack staff of team members. Mission Impossible, based upon the hit TV series, gives us a new look at spy's. Unlike Bong who gets all the girls and kills the bad guy in a matter of minutes, Hunt gets no women and can't even pin the villain in a matter of three days. Brian De Palma gives the spies in Mission Impossible a more human shell, which whom they really are and not some Super-Man hit-man. Mission Impossible, though unfaithful to the series it's derived from, sets itself up as a intelligent spy franchise. The only problem a person can have with this movie is it's confusing plot. But the only way we can get past the plot is just go with the films flow, and we do.Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt, the point man spy in a group of agents under the control of their leader Jim Phelps, played by John Voight. They are assigned to crash a party and photograph a man who is said to have a computer disk containing every name of every IMF agent in the embassy and their aliases. Hunt and his team go to the party undercover and retrieve the photographs only to have each member of the team picked off one by one. Even Phelps gets knocked off and Ethan is the only one left alive. Ethan is then told the mission was a fake to flush out a mole who's been paying an arms dealer and they suspect Ethan of being that mole. It's now up to Ethan to find the real mole and save his name with the help of a few suspended operatives, including Ving Rhames. Now this plot may sound simple, but that's because your reading it. I had to watch the movie twice to fully understand the plot.Mission Impossible may have this overly thought out plot but you forget all about it. Tom looks cool, the gadgets are cool, and the action is neatly done to give us a nice ride through a spy mission without even remembering what the plot was about. Tom's acting is perfectly done to give Ethan the on the run spy. Ving is awesome as Ethan's partner and Mrs. Beart as Claire Phelps is a nice touch. The special effects are nice. A little hokey looking though, especially the final chase scene on a train being fallowed by a helicopter. And the bad guy, even though there feels like there's three of them, is a clever plot twist that leaves us satisfied. Plus the gadgets are awesome. Exploding chewing gum, fluid spewing pens, exploding video cassettes, it's all here and not over used like any Bond weapon.The only real beef with this movie is that there wasn't enough action. De Palma acts out by directing this movie with more brain then brawn. We have too much plot but little action. The real movie's blunder doesn't even pick up till half way in when we have the memorable shot of Ethan dangling about an inch over a pressure padded floor trying to retrieve the disk of aliases. With the name Mission Impossible, we expect plenty of action sequences but instead we have a warmed over plot going three different ways. Even the ending battle isn't that memorable and it leaves us with a feeling of, not awe, but shallowness. But that doesn't mean De Palma didn't do a good job. He does a great job giving his Hitchcock touch to the movie, giving us smart characters and a real atmosphere. Mission Impossible gets a 7 out 10 from me. It was cool, but does't get our attention right away. And if you had to choose one M:I movie to see, go see part 3. Part 3 was best, easily beating out this brain scratching film and John Woo's weepy sequel. Mission impossible= B.",Mission - Impossible
205,mrbluto,A smart underrated movie,8,8 April 2002,"Mission impossible is a smart yet vastly underrated movie, a good story with lots of action and the fact of no less than 7 great actors in the cast makes it even better.

206,AmyJenson1995,The best Mission Impossible,8,12 August 2015,"To me this is the best movie of the entire series for several reasons.First, unlike the 4 sequels, this thriller is more cerebral. There is less action and the story is holding up. There are maybe not many spectacular stunts but what it lacks about it is regained by the deepness of the characters. Tom Cruise is playing a manipulated man, betrayed by his own boss and who is resolved to get his reputation back by taking down the mastermind who killed his entire team to frame him. The suspense is present all the time and we discover the real villain at the very end of the movie.The second asset is the cast. You wouldn't expect better actors to star in this movie: Tom Cruise, Jon Voight, Emmanuelle Beart, Vingh Rhymes, Jean Reno, Kristin Scott Thomas. This is a five star casting and it serves the plot to the perfection. We're feeling a chemistry between those actors and they play their parts genuinely which was not sometimes the case during the sequels.The third good point is the directing and editing. It's dark and tense just like it should be. There is no time out sometimes we are lost but we always are able to keep up with the story thanks to the directing. I never felt out of the movie I was kept in and interested in. Not only because of Tom but mostly because it's so well shot, keeping us in the story. It's something the sequels lack. They are so focused on the action sometimes I'm wondering if some stunts are really necessary to the plot or it's only to satisfy Tom's ego. I would have wished the sequels would have kept the same spirit than Mission Impossible. Less action but more story instead of a stunts piling up to cover not such a good story.",Mission - Impossible

209,mdewey,The best of the three,8,28 September 2007,"An engaging piece of Cold War histrionics set in fine motion by DePalma and his stellar entourage of fine actors. To me, it stands far ahead of the two sequels, primarily because it is more subtle and cerebral and less visceral than the others. The cast itself is not laden with merely young hot-shot actors inserted into screenplays for box office appeal. Rather, it is almost too politically correct in its casting as all the demographics seem to be represented here: young, old, Black, White, male, female, American, European etc. Yet each of the principals and the supporting cast fits into his/her respective role quite well, with little wasted motion. It's as if they each have their own ""raison d'etre"" as it pertains to the overall story line.The sophisticated spy-vs.-spy plot line is not only enhanced by the thespian talent, but also the inventive camera work that allows us to revisit ""flashbacks"" of prior scenes that are taken from perspectives other than the original. To wit, the Jon Voight bridge scene gets a few once-overs, if you will. Also, the European locales are well shot with no gratuitous indulgence, which helps to embellish the story line. Lest I forget, a sweet job by Danny Elfman adapting Lalo Schiffrin's ""MI"" theme to the soundtrack, especially during the ending credits where he shifts the theme's normal 5/4 tempo to a funkier, bluesier 4/4 time signature!Tom Cruise takes a nice turnabout from some of his earlier more ""cutesy"" roles. His role here demands of him technical expertise as well as strength of character in order for him to merely stay alive. J. Voight and V. Redgrave are in fine form in their complex and beguiling portrayals.In summary, this episode of the ""MI"" series characterizes what I consider to be a triumph of substance over form, of subtlety over the obvious. Maybe this attitude is a ""no-no"" for modern audiences, but it remains one philosophy that I will always endorse.",Mission - Impossible

211,TimBoHannon,A good idea that is its own worst enemy,5,11 June 2007,"The plot of ""Mission Impossible"" is like a defective fireman's trampoline. It is painstakingly stitched together, reinforced and strengthened. Like a faulty apparatus, however it stretches and breaks under the sheer weight of what it is supposed to support.I can explain the entire plot of this movie. I viewed the movie recently after seeing it five or so times before, but the difference was that it had been four years since my last viewing. With the aid my previous experience, I was finally able to connect all of the dots and see the whole picture. Contrary to popular belief, every facet of the story is explained, but not clearly so. In the end, it is like somebody viewing a complex tapestry through a pair of fogged glasses.I noticed a curious coincidence when I watched the theatrical trailer. A point was made to show all of the violent moments of the film. The images include mid-air acrobatics, fights, chases in the street, gunshots, exploding cars, guns being loaded, a woman being slammed against furniture, people clinging to the outside of a bullet train and an exploding helicopter. The impression is that of an exciting action film; the movie itself is not. The trailer even makes Henry Czerny's character look like the villain when he is not.The Impossible Mission Force, or IMF, is the most elite branch of the CIA where failure results in the repudiation of all knowledge of the operation. Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt, a member of an IMF team led by Jim Phelps (Jon Voight, in the role originally played by Peter Graves). Phelps is absent for the first operation, an elaborate deception used to coerce a confession. Jim's wife (foreign film actor Emmanuelle Béart) is under anesthesia for the act, and the team is worried that she will die from being under too long. It seems logical that the IMF would not risk the life of an agent without an anesthesiologist present, but never mind.The team's mission, which they choose to accept, is to catch a traitor attempting to steal the NOC List, which matches undercover code names with the agents' birth names. All but Ethan are killed, and the director of the CIA (the aforementioned Henry Czerny), believes that Hunt is an agency mole since he is the only one to survive, although Claire is soon discovered to also be alive. After his escape, Hunt contacts the list's potential buyer (Vanessa Redgrave, highly respected international actress) and agrees to steal the real McCoy so he can discover the identity of the man who betrayed him and his team.The problem is that the plot does explain itself thoroughly, but does so in such a convoluted and roundabout fashion that it leaves heads spinning like tops. There is one section where the mole is lying and trying to shift the blame to another. During this time Hunt is saying and thinking competing versions, and the result is confusing so nobody is sure what to believe. If you want see films that have complicated plots but explain them with marked clarity, watch ""Star Trek VI"" or ""The Maltese Falcon."" It is bad enough when the casual moviegoer is baffled, but when Roger Ebert says he cannot pass a test on the plot, the script has some serious problems.The other issue is the movie's inability to define itself. Despite the sales pitch of the preview, there is little action to speak of. It is really more of a suspense film, but by misrepresenting itself, it limits its potential. The two famous scenes involve the theft of a computer program from an impenetrable vault and the finale when a helicopter is attached to a bullet train and gets dragged into the Chunnel (an underwater train tunnel connecting England to France, for those who do not know). Only three bullets are fired, and none of them by Hunt.The acting is mostly pedestrian. Only Czerny and Voight, and to a lesser extent Ving Rhames and Jean Reno, stand out. Czerny is deliberate and Voight is especially effective with the delivery of two lines, ""if discovered, they'll be executed,"" and ""They stamped it didn't they? Those damn Gideons!"" Yet, for some reason, I enjoy it. It is probably the ingenuity of the vault theft and helicopter finale. Despite its significant flaws, it has a real sense of fun and some wit in the dialogue. It will disappoint fans of the original series and people expecting lots of action, but it is just good enough to rank a six out of ten.",Mission - Impossible
212,michael-3204,Rebooting done right,9,2 May 2016,"This fast-paced thrill ride is a master-class in how to revive, extend and enhance a fondly remembered (if slightly cheesy) property that, in lesser hands, might have seemed time worn. Director Brian De Palma evokes espionage classics like ""The Third Man"" to lend some -- but not too much -- flair to a twisty narrative full of double- crosses that the story and screenplay writers manage to render coherently. It has aged unusually well for a story that relies so heavily on what was supposed to be cutting-edge technology in the mid-1990s, with only the rendering of Internet communications looking silly (that email address!). The concluding action set- piece, which was one of the first to depict the newly opened ""Chunnel,"" strains credulity still, as it did at the time, but packs a punch nevertheless.

215,SebMoz,A great action classic,8,25 November 2020,"This was the movie that made Tom Cruise the action icon he is today, and it's easy to see why. This movie is well paced for the most part, and the characters are pretty solid, even though they're not super compelling. The performances are good, with Cruise delivering one of the better ones in his career. The movie is also very well directed, and the action scenes are great. The heist scene is one of the best and most tense action scenes I've ever seen, and it is definetly the highpoint of this movie. I also like the twists and turns the story take, although there are a few inconsistencies and plotholes here and there. I also think that the villain is pretty forgettable, which mostly comes from the fact that he doesn't get a lot of time to develop. Overall though, this is a great, entertaining action-movie that I highly recommend.",Mission - Impossible
216,crash21,Unbelievable but somewhat entertaining,5,9 December 2016,"I will admit, I am entertained by this movie, but the whole story is rather unbelievable, from beginning to end. The beginning scenes in the movie are rather strange. Then, after the chaos event, how Ethan gets his own contact with Max all by himself is rather laughable. Although I did like the character Max, she was involved in some of the more interesting moments of this movie.I love how the top secret computer desk in the security office simply has a pullout seat instead of a chair in front of it, because that would probably nail the security system right there with just a rattle. Plus all of the room's security system really needs to prevent the computer broken in is either disconnection from the computer when the person goes out, or even something people had in their home security at the time; motion detectors. You can even have security cameras in the room without direct vision of the computer. It's just ridiculous.The scene when they are on top the TGV is rather interesting, the part with especially with Jim being chased by Ethan towards the rear of a train going at around 360mph, this is rather unbelievable. Especially considering that Ethan's only hanging on with his hands, that's just laughable.I have to say, an earlier movie based on the country's top secret defense, ""True Lies"" was a lot better than ""Mission: Impossible"".",Mission - Impossible

The idea behind M:I is that the IMF team and the audience know what's going on, but the villains don't. Here, the script turns this basic principle on its head.There is another major problem with the Jim Phelps character here. It might have been safer to have called him Dan Briggs and explained the change in team leader in 1967.These elements combine to make the M:I movie one of the most disappointing and frustrating movie experiences - but only if you have seen the 1960s originals.

Lots of good gadgets, I liked the exploding chewing gum and the TV camera glasses. Good title graphics and music. Sequence on top of the train was excellent.Bit of a travelogue, could have done with being a little longer, say 10  15 minutes. The ending in the Channel Tunnel could have been more spectacular although this sequence did get a little ludicrous (the helicopter blades and Tom Cruise's neck).

Every time one of those perfectly choreographed action sequences started and the iconic theme song came on, I couldn't help but smile. And, of course, as the predecessor of all good spy movies, it's pretty much dripping with suspense, especially during scenes like the iconic heist one. It's the definition of a badass spy movie that can only really be referred to as a guilty pleasure.The movie hasn't aged *that* well, but I suppose that's what plays into how enjoyable it is. Sometimes there really is nothing like some old-fashioned spy action to kill an hour or two.I mean, the plot is a little bit all over the place but as far as incomprehensible plots go it really isn't that bad. It's not confusing in a deep art-house way, it's confusing in a wait-who's-backstabbing-who-and-wait-that-guy-is-a-double-agent way. And, yeah, that can be annoying, but as I mentioned, this is a movie that's less about the plot and more about its face value of entertainment.If you only watch artsy and deep movies 24/7, your brain gets tired, and you just need a Mission Impossible or two to loosen up.-Sasha.",Mission - Impossible
221,tom-456,So much is wrong with this movie,2,11 August 2020,"So much is wrong with this movie that I don't know where to start. I'll start with Tom Cruise. It goes without saying that he was selected for the part of Ethan Hunt because of box office draw. Or maybe he had enough money to buy the role in effect, which is what happens when a leading actor is listed as a ""producer"". Cruise had been acting for fifteen years when this movie was made, and yet he was every bit the awful actor that he was when he started. No true acting ability whatsoever. Then the script, which is beyond awful. Then the director, Brian De Palma. Granted, this thing was doomed before he got involved in it, but whatever hope there may have been of salvaging this movie was lost once he was chosen as director. Okay, to be fair to Brian De Palma, he has actually made a few watchable movies, but the great majority of the movies he's directed are utterly unwatchable, and this is one of them. A good director would have identified the problems with the script and would have found ways to make up for the problems with the script. But not Brian De Palma. I've watched this movie several times and one of the scenes I find particularly annoying is the scene where Ethan Hunt meets Kittridge after the failed, phony mission in Prague. What's the deal with those crazy camera angles? And why is the actor playing Kittridge (Henry Czerny) behaving in such a bizarre, flippant manner, that isn't remotely like how a real person in this role and situation would behave? ""Bizarre"" isn't even a strong enough word. This is the scene where Hunt learns that the mission where most of his coworkers died was a phony mission and that he is now suspected of being a mole. Cruise's acting is particularly awful here. Both men are talking and behaving in a way that is not the least bit plausible or believable, and the camera keeps sinking lower and lower, looking up at Cruise, then Czerny, then Cruise, then Czerny, back and forth and it just keeps getting sillier and sillier and it seems like it isn't ever going to end. Seriously? What a joke. The old TV series was a MILLION times better than this silly joke of a movie. This movie was made the way it was made because moviegoers have decided they like Tom Cruise and they like movies directed by Brian De Palma. It is a bad, bad, bad movie.",Mission - Impossible

A silly premise (someone is killing off MI team members) leads to a silly theme (Tom must find out who is doing it - all by himself, except for a small army of superspies who he conjures out of thin air join him), which leads to a silly plot device (the CIA has a super-duper secure room, with man-sized ventilation ducts that lead right to it, so Tom and his people use them, then drop a smoke bomb, and conjure up a fire engine out of thin air, and then just walk out of CIA headquarters, while the security alarms are going off -- yeah, right), which leads to a silly climactic scene (in which one of the bad guys is stupid enough to try to fly a helicopter into the ""Chunnel""), and a silly unmasking (superspy Jim Phelps is fooled by superdoofus Tom Cruise). What it adds up to is not an homage, but an unintended parody of ""Mission Impossible"". What is it about Tom Cruise's generation that must try and rewrite (stupidly) their forebear's work?

Basically Tom Cruise (Ethan Hunt) has been framed for the murders of his colleagues and for being under the employment of max, an arms dealer. Cruise decides to work for max to find out who frames him and this results to one of the best scripts of the year. There are basically no plot holes and you need required viewing to see it. Danny Elfman's score is basically his best since Dick Tracy. It has memorable scenes, for example Tom Cruise hanging inside the Black Vault. The last 20 minutes has to be basically one of the most exciting in recent years. Most critics hated this movie but it gets better with age and repeated viewing. Kudos has to go to Brian De Palma for his fancy camera work and directing. The twist in the end is brilliant and Jon Voight is a fantastic villian. My favourite character in the movie has to be Gene Kittridge. Emmanuelle Beart fans hate this movie because she is basically there as eye candy for the guys.

It has also not aged well at all.-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Directing: The story is relatively engaging throughout most of the film, but the twists seem more forced than they need to be. Brian De Palma knows how to direct action, but does not do as well with drama and suspenseful twists. *Cinematography/Editing: These are two of the weaker aspects of the film. Stephen H. Burum is a capable cinematographer, but he does not prove that with this film. Much of the film looks like home video. The editing is also quite weak with many cheesy moments. *Dialogue/Acting: The entire flow of the film feels a bit off. The dialogue is classless and thinks it is much more clever than it is. The delivery does not help, either. Tom Cruise holds his own, but much of the supporting cast is less than impressive. Even Jon Voight delivers a sub-par performance. *Music/Sound Design: While iconic, the soundtrack is not powerful or helpful in the film. The main theme is recognizable, but that is about all that can be said about it. The sound design is yet another less than average part of the film. It does not feel as grounded as it should. Everything seems to be over the top. *Production Design/Special Effects: The set design, costumes, and props are all a bit boring. Some of the gadgets are interesting, but they do not make up for the poor effort of the rest of the film. The special effects are not yet mastered in this film. It all feels rather cheap.*Conclusion: ""Mission: Impossible"" feels like a testing of the waters for modern spy films. They have not yet figured out how to pull it off, but they are still working on getting acclimated to the water temperature.",Mission - Impossible

Take trashy movies such as Cocktail and Far and Away or great movies like The Firm and A Few Good Men and imagine anyone other than Tom Cruise in the lead role. Hard to do, isn't it? His brash, cocky attitude was once appealing. Now that he feels he's an intelligent spokesman with something to say, he just comes across as an arrogant a**hole. Fortunately, the first MI falls into his earlier stage.This movie would have been just another action flick without Cruise. Sure we have a stellar cast, but did not Mr. Cruise steal every scene? He is perfect in the role of Ethan Hunt, a spy whose whole team is rubbed out in a convoluted cover up at the start. It is up to Ethan to uncover the plot behind the failed mission. The movie is a series of unveiled plot twists that becomes implausible after a while. But that's not the fun behind Mission Impossible.

I understand how someone would like this movie more than I do, and I can see myself liking it more on a future viewing, but as it stands now, I just think this movie is okay. I think Tom Cruise does a pretty good job as Ethan Hunt, but, and you won't hear me say this often, I thought the movie was shot poorly. The way it was shot, and just the general look of the movie made it look like it was made in 1960. Maybe that's what they were going for, but it kind of threw me. Another thing that threw me, and I get that this was intentional, was that there was almost no fighting. There are suspenseful scenes, which I will get to in just a minute, but there aren't any shootouts, and there is only one brief fistfight and a chase scene, that's it. I like that they tried to make a different spy-thriller type movie, but they could've included a bit more action, though I do think this was an interesting idea. I'm not saying it was necessarily bad, I'm just saying I expected something... different. Despite my complaints against this movie, I can't deny that I had an absolute blast watching it. The break-in at the HQ building was very tense, but also very funny. The two don't sound like they'd work well together, but I think they mixed the two styles very nicely in this scene. The investigation was rather confusing to me, maybe I just missed some crucial plot point, but I was lost for a large chunk of this movie, which might have hurt my opinion a bit. This movie also doesn't really have a villain, exactly. It's more about Ethan on the run, and trying to figure out what's going on, but the villain, Job, is in the movie... maybe ten minutes, and it's not like he's even an opposing force when he's not on screen, there's just... no villain. The fight on the train though, that was an excellent scene. Action- packed, suspenseful, and very entertaining. Unlike 2 and 3, this movie is certainly not playing it with a straight face, this is obviously going for a humorous tone, and I think they pulled it off well. In the end Mission: Impossible was a fun movie, despite my problems with it, it had good characters, some good tension, and a smart, if confusing story.",Mission - Impossible

The mission turns out to be a decoy, all for the purpose of tracking down the mole within the CIA. Suspicion is naturally cast on Hunt, who sets out to uncover the mole's identity and clear his name.The action scenes and camera-work were amazing, from Hunt hanging from a vent and nearly hitting the ground when the rope suddenly loosened, to the helicopter and train chase scene. Just as importantly, the plot made sense and all the action scenes had a legit purpose, which isn't always the case with quite a lot of action flicks.

What really makes this great though is De Palma's direction. Unlike the later flicks, key scenes are drawn out: there is a real Spense of suspense that is rarely achieved.

247,srivardhanms,A nice movie,7,27 June 2007,"Mission Impossible is a good entertaining movie. The +points of the movie are 1. Tom cruise: Tom cruise performance is awesome. 2. Stunts: Stunts are really very good. especially the one while copying the file from computer. Even though the story is ordinary one, presentation is good. Its just like Bond movies. But U cant find Mr. Cruise's wonderful performance there. Its Bond movie-Bond+Tom Cruise. But climax is not well framed. Looks comical where agent Hunk fighting on the top of super fast train and Helicopter following. Climax could have been formed better. Overall its good and entertaining.

It's because, in regular movies, someone explains the plot outright, so the audience doesn't have to think about it. You really had to pay attention to the details to figure it out. Let's see how accurate I am.Voight was a mole working for the CIA and was trying to steal a special list of secret operatives to sell to the enemy. To cover his tracks, he killed everyone on his team and made it look like he died with them. Cruise was taking the fall, but was determined to prove his innocence. Keeping tabs on Cruise was Voight's wife, Claire, who he happened to fall for (even though he had figured Voight wasn't dead).So, Cruise wins the trust of a criminal ready to pay top dollar for the list and gets a new team to steal the other half of the list. He and the criminal meet on the train to exchange the list and the money, but Voight wants the money. And I'm sure you can lay everything over from there on.It was a good movie with good actors, and nice story, and excellent action sequences.

The film's title is true to its history, totally impossible, 100% of the action scenes are impossible to perform in reality, I read in the book by Robert McKee about the script that all films must comply with the rules of their own established universe, this movie is set in a universe where these things are possible so I don't see any problem there, the biggest problem of the movie is that the scenes of the movie without action are empty, there is no interesting story to tell and it seems impatient to jump to the next sequence of action so that the film entertains us again.",Mission - Impossible

Sure, later installments would have a bigger budget and better production, but Cruise still manages to pull off incredible action scenes even without that.

263,cameron-burn,It begins as it means to go on: with a bang!,8,3 September 2007,"It begins as it means to go on:with a bang. A fuse is lit and the credits literally explode in a rapid-fire barrage of images and music. A re-visitation of the famous 60's TV series with that impossibly cool theme tune and a cachet of catchy catchphrases(""This tape will self destruct...""etc), this treats it's inspiration with just the right amount of respect, while at the same time managing to reinvent the premise of a group of undercover agents, working in what is now the cold war-less 90's. The plot is a contortionist's delight:a spider's web of stolen computer discs, moles, mayhem, double-crosses and murder that begins in Prague with Cruise's Ethan Hunt and his impossible missions force(including Beart, Emilio Estevez and Kristin Scott-Thomas), under the direction of Jim Phelps,(Voight in the Peter Graves role), called in to intercept a traitor and a disk containing the identities of every Western spy in Europe. When the mission goes awry and his team is annihilated, Cruise suspects he's been set up, only to find himself accused of being the mole. As Washington, London and finally the channel tunnel all go by in a blur, the rest of the film is taken up with Cruise, aided with Beart, all lips and tits, out to prove his innocence.There are, of course, gadgets galore, Cruise peeling off various cool disguises, and that piece of music at regular intervals. De Palma, undisputed master of the set-piece, pulls out all the f-stops this time around, with edgy camera angles and a series of extended tension-building nerve-jangling sequences- including one in a white-walled vault resembling something out of 2001, a space odyssey, where Cruise is suspended on wires above a touch-sensitive floor. At a little under two hours this fairly zips by, but when the script, by David Koeppe and Robert Towne, moves from action to plotting and concerns itself with upping the levels of paranoia, you'll be left scratching your head trying to decipher the twists within twists within twists. ****/*****",Mission - Impossible

The film deals with a changing world and how people cannot always change with the world around them. Sometimes the decisions that have to be made lead people to new careers while some people are able to adapt to the changing world within their lives.Over time Mission: Impossible has held up to be a successful example of a film adaption of a television series. Though the production of this film was troubled in finding it's direction and focus. Once Brian De Palma was brought on as director, he was able to alleviate these issues. The production team was able to take a concept and vague character profiles from the television series from the 1960s and translate into an engaging espionage thriller.The story follows an American espionage agent (Tom Cruise) who is framed after his team is killed during a mission. He has to unravel the plot against him and prove his innocence without the support of his government. The film also features Jon Voight, Vanessa Redgrave, Ving Rhames, Jean Reno, Kirsten Scott Thomas and Emilio Estevez. The film's plot is in constant motion. It does not stagnate for long and the film does not stop telling the story to hold the viewer's hand to keep up with the plot twists.This film was the first time that Tom Cruise displayed his action star potential. It not only solidified him as an A-list actor but also someone who could be the forerunner for a franchise. He had to display a different range of acting, as at the time a movie such as this was unexplored territory for him; as well as learn to develop physical abilities for his roles which has continued to the present day.. While the direction of the franchise has been doubted throughout it's course this installment set it on it's path.",Mission - Impossible

275,Mike_Wiggins,Inexcusable revision of a classic TV series.,5,1 February 2006,"I haven't seen this movie for a while, but I do remember that when the movie ended I was livid. It wasn't that the production was poor (it was quite well done) or that the acting was poor (no Oscars, but good solid performances by all). The problem was with the screenplay.For those of you who did not grow up watching the Mission Impossible TV series, I can understand why you liked this movie and its sequel: you have nothing to base your opinion on except the movie. But for someone who has seen almost every episode of the Mission Impossible TV series, there were two fatal flaws in the screenplay that made me want to force-feed the screenplay back to the writers (David Koepp and Robert Towne) or at least force them to create an UNABRIDGED, G-rated screenplay for James Joyce's ""Ulysses"" before they are allowed to write anything else.The first sin has to do with teamwork. In the TV series, Jim Phelps would receive instructions on his next task, and after the message had self destructed, Jim would go about selecting those individuals who would be needed to complete this particular ""impossible mission."" After Jim Phelps met with the members of this team to discuss what needed to be done, the show would go about showing how each individual or groupings of individuals would go about with their assigned tasks (i.e. how DO you get tons of gold bullion out of a heavily guarded and surveilled vault without arousing suspicion?). This movie ended up ONLY being about Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise's character). As a matter of fact, MI2 was, once again, ONLY being about Ethan Hunt. This is so out of character with Bruce Geller's original TV series that I felt that the only thing the movie and the TV series had in common was the name ""Mission Impossible."" I think the reason for this is that in this day and age of movies like ""The Bourne Identity"" (which I liked, by the way), the Bond movies, and others, where there is only one person who seems to have his act together, and can fight off a small army of highly trained assassins without getting scratched, the idea of the individual hero is believed to be more palatable than one showing teamwork (other than movies depicting sports or war). In the TV series, I cared about the characters  in this movie I was hoping Ethan Hunt would slip on a banana peel or something.*** SPOILERS FOLLOW! *** *** YOU'VE BEEN WARNED! *** The second sin was where the writers had Jim Phelps as a double agent. While it's true that a writer can do just about anything he/she pleases for the purposes of writing a good story, you are not supposed to make major changes to an established character for the sake of the story. For example, what if there was a remake of ""Forrest Gump"" where Gump becomes smart enough to receive the Nobel Prize for Physics? That would be a major turn-off for me. How about Harry Potter teaming up with Valdemort to become drug overlords? How about Wallace and Gromit being ax murderers and using the victims as a spread for Wallace's ""cracking toast""? You get the idea. In the Mission Impossible TV series, there were plenty of opportunities for Jim Phelps to be indicated as suspicious. But guess what? He was someone that was so committed to his team members that when one of them got captured in one episode he came up with a hastily made plan, using the remaining members (including himself), to get that member back. In other words: he was never a turncoat! Making him one in this movie was lazy and sloppy writing, was just as ridiculous a premise as the above examples, and was inexcusable in my estimation.*** END OF SPOILERS *** For those who liked the movie, I really do understand why you did. But due to the writing I could not enjoy the movie at all. Because of this I rate ""Mission Impossible"" (the movie) a 5.------------------------------------------------------ For those of you who haven't seen the TV series, take a look at a couple of episodes. I'm sure the 60's technology will be a turn-off to some, and many of the plots DO strain the limits of believability. But many of the plots also embodied a spark of originality and creativity that I embraced and always had me wondering how in God's name they were going to pull off THIS one. Getting the gold bullion out of the vault was one such episode (mentioned above). Another episode that is seared in my mind was how they managed to get a criminal to reveal the location of a stolen stash of millions of dollars before the statue of limitations expired. Yet another episode (the one mentioned previously about the IMF (Impossible Mission Force) team member who was captured) was frightening in the way it portrayed the captured member being interrogated with special emphasis on trying to discover what this members' worst fears were and how to exploit them. When the captors found out this fear happened to be of enclosed spaces they used it to maximum effect. You were shown how the sanity of the member started to unravel and how that member started to crack, almost giving away the existence of the IMF. In other words, the TV series was about SO much more than just one character ""whuppin' ass"".",Mission - Impossible

First let's get rid of the Jim Phelps character so that Tom Cruise's ego has no competitors and he can take over the lead spot in any unfortunate spin offs from this mess. Second let's forget clever story lines and substitute ridiculous unbelievable special effects. Cruise must have been made of asbestos to survive the train explosion scene. Brian de Palma ""directed"" this ? The (original)I.M.F force was a team effort lead by the uncorruptible Jim Phelps and they relied on brains plus meticulous planning to succeed in their missions. Each member had his part to play in order for the team to survive and they were the good guys saving us from the bad guys. This movie will do nothing for de Palma's reputation.

I've never seen helicopters flying in tunnels despite oncoming trains, and I've not seen people break in to the CIA headquarters as firefighters.But the film starts off well, and I very much enjoyed the idea of having a mission that messes up to start everything off. From then on, Ethan (Cruise) tries to find the man responsible for the ambush and death of 4 of his agents. He does this whilst being hunted by his own organisation which suspects him of being behind it. There are plot inconsistencies - why does Ethan decide to infiltrate the CIA's vault just to arrange a meeting with a cyber-terrorist who knows who the mole is? Why when he knows who the mole is, does he not go after him? Some loved the final sequence of a helicopter attached to a train, but it was that kind of enthusiasm that led to scenes like Boeing jumbo jets being split in half by lasers in later action films!

The strength of the MI team is precisely in their team. The beautiful synergy of unique talents, always contribute in outsmarting their opponents. We have such a usable cast from beginning, what do we do with them? We kill them all from the beginning. Why? So that entire script, story ( for lack of the better word) could serve one purpose only : Tom Cruise's EGO. The second movie is what I consider pornography of such exploitation. But lets go back to the first one. This is one of those scripts that is precisely tailored to one man's vision.

283,realalbertbarrios,Mission Impossible starts strong!,8,9 April 2020,"Mission Impossible is a very energetic action flick that sometimes becomes much better than average action flicks during the 90s. First of all, this film would've been a 7 star movie. But since the wonderful Tom Cruise is in this film, this is a 8-star movie for me. One of the issues of the film is the plot. It's entertaining of course, but it becomes convoluted. Now I just came from watching the Pirates of the Caribbean and its convoluted storylines and I couldn't stand it. The other issue is the CGI at the end of the film. It just looks fake. The CGI makes this film look like a Spy Kids film. Overall, it's a fun action film with great performances by Tom Cruise and Jon Voight, thrilling action sequences, and a story that may not make sense in the end, but will keep you thrilled nevertheless.",Mission - Impossible
284,bdiebold,Ego vehicle,2,9 April 2004,"It's disgusting Tom Cruise turned a clever, fun, ensemble show into yet another big effect vehicle for his mammoth ego. I could hardly believe my eyes when in the first few minutes Cruise (his movie, I hold him responsible) kills off his entire team (which consists by and large of far more talented actors) just so he can do his lone wolf vengeance thing (""this time it's personal!""). In those few minutes, he destroyed any relationship the movie had to the show. It's a disgrace. I've never liked Tom Cruise, but his astonishingly arrogant appropriation and destruction of the Mission:Impossible theme is a new low.Aside from this, the movie itself is utterly formulaic, uniting the implausible with the predictable. Jean Reno is good in anything, but no one can save this.",Mission - Impossible
285,Howlord,A Refreshingly Smart Summer Movie,9,23 April 2002,"After seeing Mission: Impossible back in 1996, I couldn't stop singing the film's praises.  Here, finally was a film with some great set pieces and an incredibly complex plot to carry them.  Sure the film was lacking in character.  I didn't care, I was too busy trying to piece together the labrynthine series of double crosses and backstabs.  Apparently, a great many people thought the movie made no sense.  I find that to be a rather disturbing trend resonating from audiences who no longer wish to have their minds entertained as well as just their eyes.  This movie's plot is so well constructed that it likely takes more than one viewing to piece together completely.  The general impatience shown towards this film's narrative is a bad sign for the future of intelligent thrillers.  It's too bad too.  Here was a summer film that actually trusted its audience's intelligence, only to learn that its trust was misplaced.  9/10",Mission - Impossible
286,BLDJ,Fun.,8,30 December 1999,"CONTAINS ONE SPOILERFor those who have ever watched the old good series, get lost- this movie has absolutely anything to do with them. If you liked Jim, the IMF boss from the old series, also get lost- he's the bad guy now. But if you don't really care about matching the old series with this movie (like myself) then give this baby a try- you won't regret it.It is a very good movie as a thriller (""WHO THE HECK IS THE BAD GUY AROUND HERE?!!"", ""HOW THE HECK WILL HE INFILTRATE INSIDE THE CIA BUILDING?!!"", etc) and very entertaining. I also liked that chewing gum that is in reality a bomb.I only found three problems in this movie:1- No movement detector in a top-security CIA computer room??? Give me a break!2- An helicopter... in a tunnel??? Too impossible to be true. You may find it ridiculous.3- The plot is a little bad.So I give this movie a 8/10. I think I am going to watch the Mortal-Kombat-styled Mission Impossible 2, but I doubt it is going to be better than this one. Tom Cruise fighting Kung-Fu or something? I guess he will, who knows...

Yes, this film was complicated, but to those of us who could follow the plot, it was enthralling. If you didn't like it, it's because you didn't understand it (although many don't want to admit this).

Yes, it's true, the plot doesn't make much sense when you are watching it or even when you think back on it.  BUT WHO THE HELL CARES!!!  It's a brilliantly filmed, stylish, and original piece of work by a true master of cinema, Brian De Palma.There are several sequences in this film that blow my mind.  1) the first job near the beginning...2) the ultra-stylish, eye-popping, breathtaking, nail-biting, brilliant computer room break-in sequence, with Tom Cruise hanging from a cable on the ceiling---woah..3) the scene in the restaurant with the fish tank (notice how the angles on the characters when they're talking get increasingly more crooked...)  4) and the mind-boggling finale on the bullet train, you won't believe your eyes.Don't watch this movie and expect it to be realistic, because it isn't.

Most puzzling is that many of the actors in this movie have done GREAT movies. Thus, I have to wonder, were they improving in this piece of crap? Was De Palma just like ""Meh, f*ck it, let the special effects guys write this garbage."" Don't get me wrong, Tom Cruise is an awful actor anyway but Christ it was a so-called all star line-up!

291,MovieNewsAndUpdates,A Great Start To The Series,7,13 November 2012,"The decade of 90's has always been my favorite. Some incredible movies has also made it to the list of top 250. Although this one hasn't it remains to be one of the very good movies of that time. Well, so far i have seen all the for parts of this franchise and i have enjoyed all of them. Mission Impossible series has always been a lot of action with a decent story, so the intention of watching these movies are more to enjoy and less to think. However, the first part of this series, this one, really contradicts the other parts. MI1 has a really interesting story which when seen for the first time can be a little bit confusing due to the interesting twists in it. With actors like, Jean Reno, Jon Voight and Tom Cruise the performances are engaging and convincing to build up on a good script. The movie has very convincing action scenes especially considering it was made in 1996, and so i loved the action scene in the end which is on the roof top of the train. My favorite part is the piece of background score which begins when Ving Rhames asks Tom Cruise ""You really think we can do it"" on which Tom Cruise replies "" We ARE going to do it""",Mission - Impossible
292,haela,This one will never go out of style,10,16 September 2012,"You could look long and hard, and never find a film more fun to watch than Mission:Impossible. It's classy, stylish, and heart-pounding.First, let me address the frequent complaints about an overly complex plot. This is not true: there are a few lines you shouldn't miss, but pay attention as you watch and you will be fine (i.e., don't wander off to get popcorn).Ethan Hunt is an American agent who has been framed and falsely accused of treason and the murder of his team. He strikes out to clear his name with a group of similarly disavowed agents. Together they must prove that Ethan was set up, and prevent a dangerous weapons dealer from accessing a list that would betray the identities of every American deep cover agent alive.The story is well constructed, without the typical action movie plot holes. The film is well balanced between action and dialog. But the best part of M:I is Ethan Hunt, whom Tom Cruise not only portrays, but lives and defines. A rare action hero with a brain, Ethan is quick, fit, savvy with both a computer and a gun. Driven and determined, he thinks quick on his feet and doesn't look back. But the most rare (and valuable) trait he possesses is his powerful magnetism and charisma: he makes you like him, and instead of coming across as arrogant, his confidence and assurance draw you to him.I almost never give a film a 10/10 rating, but Mission:Impossible is one of those rare films that gets every detail right. There's nothing to dislike, and everything to enjoy...highly recommended!",Mission - Impossible
293,Oro-Indiano,Mission: Irrelevant,10,13 June 2000,"Like many others, I was disappointed with the fact that for the big screen, almost all the elements which made the tv series ""Mission: Impossible"" so entertaining - the team ethos, the complex con-tricks, etc - were jettisoned in favour of a huge ego boost for the one man show that is Mr. Tom Cruise. It is particularly annoying given that the ""plot"" chosen to replace it is so bog-standard and predictable.  An honest hero is framed for something he didn't do and spends the rest of the movie trying to clear his name and out the real spy... This seems to be the plot of every third blockbuster these days - two titles released just before ""M:I"" using exactly the same storyline spring to mind: ""Judge Dredd"" and Schwarzenegger's ""Eraser"".  It was also totally un-necessary to take the hero of the original series and make him the villain of the movie - can you imagine a film version of ""The Untouchables"" with the cops hot on the trail of the evil gang boss Eliot Ness?  There is also the fact that the movie is deeply insecure; one feels that it would like to be a cold-war style espionage picture but does not have the courage of its convictions so tacks a cheesy and implausible action sequence onto the end.  I could go on, but at the end of the day, my list of criticisms are all are all pretty subjective, and don't really point to this being a bad film, simply one that I don't like. But then suddenly it struck me.  The reason I find this movie so intensely pointless, and the reason I think it's no good, is that so many scenes are so stupid, or just completely extraneous.  Take for example the films most memorable moment - the break in to the CIA building to steal half of the 'NOC' list.  We are told that this is the most secure room in the entire world, that it has every security system known to man.  Except, it seems, a plain and simple good old CCTV camera!  Sure, the scene is well directed and a fair amount of tension is wrung from it, but if you take a step back to think, it's preposterous.  Besides, by my reckoning there is no reason for Hunt even to have the real NOC list if he is planning on double bluffing simply to smoke out the spy, so the scene shouldn't even be there.  Why would he endanger all those agents by handing over the real list? 
Nit picking?  Certainly, but it sums up for me why the whole thing is a waste of time.  There are plenty of movies one can enjoy by checking ones brain in at the theatre door; but when a movie cloaks itself in a supposedly complex plot and encourages the audience member to engage his or her brain, and then doesn't even stand up to scrutiny, I find the whole process deeply depressing - more so when the film takes itself as seriously as this one evidently does.  I can't even be entertained anymore, because I am acutely aware of how shallow, empty, and ultimately pretentious it all is.  So sorry folks, but if you ask me this is a red herring wrapped up in a Macguffin, wrapped up in a shaggy dog story with fleas, all designed for the sole purpose of making Tommy look good.  It's a real shame that the supporting cast, production values, direction etc are all so high, since the film itself is so thoroughly worthless.  At my most generous, I'd give it...(4/10)",Mission - Impossible
294,jabaw1,Dumb movie with stupid plot.,5,17 November 2006,"I am a huge fan of the director Brian De Palma and I have to say that this is his worst movie yet (apart from Mission to Mars). Tom cruise is incapable of doing a good performance in all his movies, and this is no exception. I seriously don't see what everyone sees in him. Why other good actors like Jean Reno and Jon Voight would waste their time with this is absolutely beyond me. The only good thing that ever comes out of this movie is it's awesome theme. That has to be one of the most memorable pieces of music of all time. What amazes me most about this piece of schlock is that it managed to get TWO sequels to it.

Its insanely difficult to make even an okay movie I think nostalgia is winning the day with the old fans of the show. The show was cool but let's face it..its not all that its now cracked up to be by the fans. It hasn't aged well at all and is hokey at times. the sequels to this film are a fun watch but ultimately crappy. Ill agree with that assessment. This film is superior to the sequels, however.I'm sorry, I disagree with the people that have a heightened sense of nostalgia regarding this material. I can understand. At least be fair, though. Also, Tom gets a bad rap from the older gen born in the 60s. I grew up as a child in the 80s to early 90s. From my perspective he is a fine actor.. always giving it his all. I of course watched him as an impressionable child so my perspective will be different. I'm sure people are justified in their not being fond of him and even I was initially hungry to judge him down a notch when he went all nutzo in front of the nation. His ego I can imagine is quite huge considering he's been so privileged for so long. Just the same.. we don't have to be friends with him do we? I think its cool that perspectives can be so different and its very telling. I say tom is worthwhile from where I've been sittin and I refuse to pass judgments on the man. This movie is great. Id rate it a 7.8 or 7.9 easily if I could. I don't know about an 8 so ill put down a strong 7 as my rating. Maybe ill change my mind.",Mission - Impossible

Speaking of the action, it was brilliant. The gun play, a frickin helicopter in a train tunnel, brilliant! John Voights villain was an unexpected one.

Unfortunatley, once the team members are systematically eliminated one by one we leave ""Mission:  Impossible"" behind and instead stumble into a high tech version of ""The Fugitive"" with Tom Cruise again playing himself as he so often has in so many of his films.  This is a shame considering the strong supporting cast and the potential it had to be an intelligent and intriguing update of the original series.

300,THFC,A tense thriller that is not (despite popular belief) impossible to follow.,8,8 December 1998,"I would like to reiterate what ""Anonymous of Derby, England"" said about this film (20th November). The fact that so many people have complained that they ""didn't get it"" is proof that our brains are being atrophied by so many movies that do all our thinking for us. I had no trouble in following the plot and found the fact that I actually had to concentrate and think things through quite refreshing. Okay, so a lot of the stunts were a bit far fetched but what does it matter when they were so entertaining? After all, it is only a movie; nobody expects us to believe that these things could really happen any more than they expect us to believe that King Kong really existed or that there's a Volcano ready to errupt in L.A. Besides, with the inspired casting of David Schneider as the train driver, Brian de Palma must have had his tongue in his cheek for at least some of the time. He's created a masterful boy's own adventure story, an original ""ripping yarn"" and that brilliant comic touch added to this perfectly.""Mission Impossible"" is a visual and cerebral treat. Tom Cruise is excellent as Ethan, Vanessa Redgrave makes a superb villian and Jean Reno is watchable in ANYTHING he does. The only weak link is Emmanuelle Beart, who did a good job of looking beautiful but very little else. What a shame Kristin Scott Thomas couldn't have taken a more central role; she makes the gorgeous but bland Beart look like a waste of space.I give this 8 out of ten and it would have been more if it wasn't for Beart's character.",Mission - Impossible
301,James McK,Just a bit different from your average action film.,8,5 July 2000,"Action films, they come and go, thrill you while you sit there in the seat and when they're finished, they're gone from your mind. Some however, stick in your mind a little longer, and some you can even watch again, and again, and again.Mission: Impossible is one of those action films. What is it that first made it stick in my mind? Well, it starts off as a typical, though rather high technical, espionage thriller, albeit one with a flashier than usual opening credits sequence. But from this the film plays on your expectations, bred by years of action and thriller movies that have run together on the same clichés, and of course, the original series, and within 40 minutes the audience is left bewildered, breathless and with absolutely no idea where this thing is going to go next. And it lives up to these expectations, throwing the audience into increasingly complex situations, casting questions on the morality of all of the cast members, even Tom Cruise. It delivers surprises right until the end.Of course some of these things are big no-no's for Hollywood, and a lot of people are left confused and in the dark by this movie. Yes, there are some problems with dialouge, and it does sometimes go a little over the top and a little ""Yeah Right!"" but, hey, it's Mission: Impossible isn't it?OK so riveting on first viewing, but what would make us want to see it again once you know all the surprises waiting? You could argue for director Brian De Palma and Screenwriters excellent build-up of paranoia, but then of course there are the set pieces, the trap at the start, the CIA break in, and of course, that train sequence, implausible, but brilliant stuff.",Mission - Impossible
302,stu-bell,"Good and bad, thrilling and frustrating.",7,29 July 2015,"Mild spoilers ahoy. Can one really spoil a 19 year old film though?I very much enjoyed this film when seeing it on its initial release in 1996, at the fabulous Empire, Leicester Square, London. Whilst never a die-hard fan of the TV series, I had been entertained and absorbed by it, and I liked that they attempted to introduce many elements of that series into the big-screen incarnation whilst broadening it out with big action sequences (notably the Channel Tunnel finale) to cater for the 90s Blockbuster audience. And this is why the film both thrills and annoys me. The throwbacks are all nice (the masks, the intricate con-job set- ups etc), but ultimately undone by the decision to make an action- leaning set-piece laden film. They were largely jettisoned as the franchise progressed, which is fine, but I felt short-changed here. This may be petty, but having Jim Phelps (for those that don't know, the protagonist and hero of the series from its second series onward) turn out to be the villain was just plainly unforgivable. Imagine if the ""Star Trek"" reboot had cast James T Kirk as the antagonist. That left a real sour taste in the mouth.I'm surprised that the screenplay was handed in by writers as esteemed as David Koepp and Robert Towne, because much of the early dialogue, notably in the session where the team are briefed, seems forced and unrealistic - Hollywood quippy rather than natural. It's not helped that Tom Cruise's performance oscillates wildly between stern, serious, and meaning business, and toothy grin, over keen to quip and be liked. Maybe it was intended for the character, but it's at odds with how I felt it should be played, and different from the later portrayals of operative Hunt. I like Cruise in the latter films but he's too ""Jerry Maguire"" here for me. I did love his ""disc disappearing"" trick in Liverpool St though, and the rest of the cast were all solid. I'm glad Ving Rhames (as Luther) has become a mainstay of the franchise, Henry Czerny fits the mould of every disgruntled MI team boss throughout the series to a tee, Emmanuelle Beart is HOT, Reno is... well, he's Jean Reno, only with more attitude. Kristin Scott Thomas adds a welcome touch of class, and the Lithuanian lady playing Hannah is also one not to KooBoaCN. And of course there's the sublime Vanessa Redgrave... very watchable all round.The plot is not difficult to follow, despite common perception. It's just, frankly, a little silly. The idea that all this confidential information about non-confirmed agents would be stored in one place (even in the most secure room in the world, but with lousy server security) just doesn't ring true. And, incidentally, if it's the most secure room in the world, have they not thought about putting in a simple CCTV camera as well? But that's by the by. DePalma is an infamous admirer of Hitchcock, so I'm not surprised he's happy to hoist such a heinous MacGuffin on which to hang his outlandish, stylized, and highly engrossing set-pieces without too much concern for credibility. But those set pieces are impressive. The Prague setup, the raid at Max's, Langley (despite being so goofy), the train (London Terminus on the TGV - bless!), are all expertly staged and enticing scenes. There's just that niggling sense of ""this could have been more"" haunting the picture.M:I 2 I'll give a pass to, M:I 3 I think hit the mark completely and utterly, and is still my favourite of the bunch. GP is fun too, and I look forward to RN next week. This first one, I keep thinking about though, because it's not bad, by any stretch of the imagination, it's just not as good as it could have been.

303,sazo-2,Impossible scenes with style,7,8 January 2007,"In contrary with its sequels this film is not based only the visuals and action sequences. The director tries to put emphasis also on the storyline and evolution of the characters and resulting in a very good ""spyish"" atmosphere. OK, also John Woo tries to give style to Tom Cruise, but this results in a ridiculous smooth-macho superman character spiced with white pigeons... This movie also has some ridiculous scenes (like the ""I am gonna' kill you with the helicopter rotor, by smashing and cutting you, while you are holding desperately to the back of the train and speeding with 200-250 km/h in the tunnel"" scene). But it also has scenes which remained famous and were taken or parodized by other movies (think to the rope scene in the computer room). The movie also delivers a great remake of the famous MI sound theme. The acting is good, Jon Voight, Jean Reno and Tom Cruise are giving stylish performances. Overall, the movie is enjoyable and deserves an above average ranking because the good sound score and it's impact on the action film industry.",Mission - Impossible
304,fishpoo,A comparison of M:I-1 & M:I-2,7,7 May 2003,"Mission: Impossible 1 is a movie about an agent getting framed and then solving a mystery. It's more of a Thriller than an Action movie. Mission: Impossible II is a completely different kind of movie. It's just like every other average action movie: Lots of action, not much plot, a boring bad guy and a good looking woman.Mission: Impossible 1 is definitely a much better movie than M:I-2. But it does still have quite a few flaws. I often have trouble following plots. But after watching Mission Impossible twice I still don't understand all of what's going on and I don't think I'm the only person who has this problem. This doesn't stop the film from being entertaining, but it's a bit annoying. I think I understood everything in M:I-2, not that there is much to understand.What annoys me the most about Mission: Impossible 1 is the fact that Jim (Jon Voight), one of the most important characters, isn't around for most of the movie. So his character didn't really get very developed. As for Claire, I don't think the movie would be any different if she weren't in it.The characters in Mission Impossible II are more traditional. The villain is someone who used to work with Ethan but has now turned bad. He has a Scottish accent, to let us know that he's the bad guy. If Ethan's boss hadn't said anything, I would have never guessed that the villain and Ethan worked with each other. They seem like complete strangers.My favorite part of Mission Impossible 1 has got to be the bit where Ethan and his gang steal information from the computer in that room with all the high security. I've seen it spoofed in quite a few other things. M:I-2 doesn't really have anything like that. Except Ethan Hunt retrieving the disease. But that wasn't really the same thing and it just turned into a big action scene with lots of guns. Stuff like that isn't very entertaining these days. Most of the action scenes in M:I-2 also involve loads of slow motion. This is just annoying and not cool.Overall I give Mission: Impossible 3/5 and Mission: Impossible II 2/5. I hope Mission Impossible 3 will be more like the first film.",Mission - Impossible

You got Tom Cruise and Jon Voight, some cool action, it looked pretty entertaining. What really got my attention, unfortunately, was the backlash that it got from actors of the original series, with one walking out of the theater and still proclaimed it as a terrible movie until his death. This...this should be fun.There is one way to describe the effects of this movie: dated. Really, really dated. The effects, especially during the train sequence don't look good or convincing today. Plus, I'm convinced that the IMF is either blind or stupid. The whole movie is set off due to one plot point about the leadr (Voight)getting killed, though we later found out he did it himself. I think everyone in the audience could tell that his hand was curved. Who are you fooling, really?With that said, I will give it credit that Cruise was really good in this (even though he looked like Wynona Rider from Alien Resurrection) and the one scene that everyone remembers (the highwire scene) is DEFINITELY the coolest. No effects were used and to this day, it will still make you clench your buttcheeks and pause your breathing.

M:I also teams a score of brilliant actors, albeit briefly.My problems with Mission: Impossible are purely based on an actor's egomania.Mission: Impossible was a pet project of Tom Cruise for a long time. The film was doctored by Robert Towne. The character pieces involved were brilliant. But they were too few and too brief. Tom Cruise has attempted to define himself akin to Sean Connery in his role as James Bond. Unfortunately, there is no Ian Fleming here. If Tom Cruise had let go a little bit... but he didn't. And so the film is what it is. Sadly, it is not Mission: Impossible. Brilliant performances by Vanessa Redgrave and other supporting characters. Tom Cruise would be an excellent Superman. But his Ethan Hunt is no replacement for the patronly Jim Phelps we have all spent so long growing with and growing to love.You do not take the fanbase from Star Trek, pack them into a theatre, and then show James Kirk killing his crew slowly and meticulously and then destroying the Federation from within. With Luke Skywalker you could pull it off, but not with James Kirk. Not with Jim Phelps. And the computer graphics show so many tells that it distracts from the film.This could have been a great film. Unfortunately Paramount wanted a summer blockbuster and Tom Cruise was more than willing to supply.
YOU DO NOT CARE ABOUT THIS YOUNG, RECKLESS PUNK THE SAME WAY YOU ALWAYS HAVE FOR THE GROUP OF SUAVE PROFESSIONALS YOU HAVE GROWN TO EXPECT FROM MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE. Vanessa Redgrave has delivered an Oscar-worthy performance, once again. But one comes to expect that. But this film is not what it could have been. Still good.A success, undeniably, for Brian De Palma.A failure for Tom Cruise.",Mission - Impossible

311,Luvfilms-2,Star Vehicle VS. Ensemble,6,30 November 1998,"What I enjoyed most about the series, Mission Impossible, was that the characters in the story could never succeed in their mission without the others to back them up with their various types of expertise and steely nerves. It was suspenseful wondering if one person might not make it or slip up.The entire team is killed off in the beginning of the movie and Tom Cruise recruits a few people to support him ever-so-slightly while he carries out his personal mission for the truth. Not as tense and exciting as it could have been.",Mission - Impossible
312,Vmax,Sadly crosses the thin line between the almost possible and the truly impossible,4,21 September 1999,"As almost an oldtimer, having enjoyed the original TV series, I rushed to the theater to remember  some of the old feeling. Flawed casting, an unbalanced script, hesitating acting and over-the-top special effects made me grind my teeth in anger and close my eyes tight shut in shame. The plot, the effects, the relations, the triple treason etc all have a distinct smell of the improbable. It has several moments you feel like saying ""yeah right"" to the screen to indicate what you see is truly and utterly impossible. And as always, that kills the movie. And that's sad.",Mission - Impossible
313,apuluvmanjula,Why I absolutely despise this film...,5,10 November 2001,"The answer is in the first twenty minutes of the film.  Being familiar with the wonderful television show that this film was based upon, I was grossly horrified that so many people were senselessly murdered in the first twenty minutes of the film!  The entire team sans Tom Cruise is killed, and there are some big names in that list (Emilio Esteves, Kristen Scott Thomas, and Joh Voight as Jim Phelps).  I always thought that the appeal of the original television show was the ensemble cast working together on these very complex and often convoluted plots.  This film flatly contrasts with the one thing that made the show so fabulous and action-packed.  When I first saw this film in the theatre, I was horrified.  I couldn't believe that anyone could have let this film be made.  It's just so different from the television show.  While I can see the point of making a film based upon a television show drastically different from the show itself, the very fact that Jim Phelps is the villain of this film is reason enough to ridicule the film.  It just doesn't fit!  It's almost as if Tom cruse didn't have enough of a role as the IMF's ""team leader"" he also had to become the head of the IMF at the very end of the film as Jim Phelps is killed at the end and everyone that was involved on the very convoluted plot against the IMF is killed.  I like Brian De Palma.  Unlike most people, I think his style of paying frequent homage to his predecessors should be quite flattering, not an insult or a sign of an inexperienced, unoriginal director.  This time, though, what we have is a very good action movie that falls flat when the film becomes a single character vehicle rather than an ensemble piece similar to the original show.  The ensemble would have made the film all the better, even if the writers did have to rewrite the entire film in order to get a new plot.  (BTW, I think it is interesting to note here that ""Mission: Impossible"" managed to receive a Razzie nomination for ""Worst Screenplay for a Film that Made Over $100 Million.""  Just a small tidbit to back up my point)",Mission - Impossible

Also, the plot was a little, well, boring. Digital tech was overused, as it was in the second. As for the actors, they did well. I liked Cruise as Ethan Hunt, and Jon Voight made a good Phelps, if he hadn't been a villain, that is. But to kill off Emilio Estevez so quickly just seemed...abrupt, not to mention cold-hearted. And Phelp's justification of it was not nearly convincing enough. After all, these were people with whom he had worked for decades! However, if someone saw this who had never seen the original, they may enjoy it as an introductory movie. But without the sequels, this would have been terrible. As a launch to the sequels, especially the third, this was halfway decent. Halfway. That's why I give it a five.",Mission - Impossible

Wrong. I put this into my VCR last night (I bought it for about a dollar at a used store- it was much cheaper than renting it) and I expected the worst. Normally I try to stay neutral, but knowing Tom Cruise, and knowing the kind of films he does- such as Top Gun (thats right, I said it) I just didn't know what to expect, or remember enough of it to pass judgment on it. However, I am a huge DePalma fan, and love his style (which is just a LITTLE different than Hitchcocks, I understand). Well anyway, This is about a crew of spies, namely the point man named Ethan Hunt. While on a mission, every one of his members are killed, and he is framed with being a corrupt agent. Hunt, to clear his name and get his parents out of jail, sets out for the real mole by way of the book of job. Overall, this is a film is one of Tom Cruis' best. He doesn't have many, mind you, but this is one of the few. Brian DePalma DOES NOT disappoint either. This movie looks and feels awesome. The direction is awesome, and it has the little ""DePalma"" trademark that we all love (or just me?). If you want a mindless action flick, watch mission impossible 2- if you want one with a semi-complex storyline (I don't even know if I would call it that. Not that hard to follow, but certainly more hard to follow than Mission Impossible 2)- watch mission impossible. 8/10",Mission - Impossible

Classic tale of pure good and pure evil, plus saving the world, plus wolf turned into sheep, I mean into a beautiful woman burglar with whom the main hero evidently falls in love, plus redemption through self-sacrifice, plus obliterating all bad guys with a casual ease, plus.... And all these pluses add up to a terribly big minus. This is a spy flick even worse and lamer than James Bond. It is as far from being realistic as it gets. Virtually nothing that TomCruise does smells like reality. Watch it, if you think that magnificent stunts and burning kerosene and pleasing your twisted need for grandeur are what a good movie is made of. The two good things about the movie are the stunts, bravely done (but absolutely unrealistic for the setting); and the soundtrack that is quite decent. For these two, I give this movie a weak 3.

INTENSITY, nearly every frame and moment bleeds with this, this film has a good chunk of people sitting around and talking for an action movie but it all feels great with such a courageous set up. The set pieces are all incredibly memorable and perfectly executed with smart cinematography, editing, acting, and music!I will say that it does drag at just a few times and that the characters could definitely be developed a bit better, especially Ethan Hunt. Other than what plot has been engrossed upon him, we don't know much about him that gives him a realistic human character feel.If you haven't seen this yet...what are you doing?! Watch it now!

325,wsg31987,The film that started this idiosyncratic spy franchise,8,1 February 2016,"NOTE: This review contains major SPOILERS, do not read if you've never seen this film but would like to. The first film in the Tom Cruise produced/starring ""Mission: Impossible"" film series is still one of the best in the franchise. Though a huge box office success when released in 1996, the film was (I would argue) misunderstood and unfairly maligned by contemporary critics. The 90s were a period where adaptations of old TV series started to become en vogue. Most were more parodies of their source material than adaptations (The Flinstones, The Brady Bunch, and The Adams Family spring immediately to mind). Mission: Impossible doesn't so much parody it's source material as flip it's middle finger at it. It's perhaps one of the most irreverent adaptations of anything I have ever seen, to the point where it's not clear who the target audience was. Criticized during it's initial release for a convoluted and hard-to-follow plot, revisiting the 60s' TV series is perhaps the best way to understand what the writers were going for here. See? Most Mission: Impossible episodes involved the Impossible Missions Forces team leader, Jim Phelps, learning the details of his latest mission, assembling his ensemble team of spies, and thwarting an enemy through disguise (with life-like face masks being a preferred method) and misdirection. The series was an ensemble, held together by Mr. Phelps but anchored by the idea of teamwork. As the film opens, Phelps learns that someone is planning to steal a disc containing the names of all the IMF's undercover operatives and sell it to an arms dealer. His mission, should he choose to accept it, is to replace the list with a fake one, and photograph this enemy agent committing the crime so he can be brought to justice. His team is assembled, and the mission is a go.So far, so faithful. But that's when things take a turn. Unlike in the TV series of the same name, the mission does not go as planned. Most of the IMF agents on the case are brutally murdered during the operation, leaving only Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt, and Phelps wife Claire alive. A smarmy CIA agent named Kitridge (Henry Czenry) reveals the thief was a plant, and that the real objective was to uncover a mole in the IMF. Since at this point in the story the only known survivor is Hunt, he is believed by the CIA to be the mole. Hunt escapes his meeting with Kitridge, and the story takes off in earnest. This is where the film (and it's first 3 sequels) reveal their true motivations: to create a star vehicle for two people—Tom Cruise and Brian De Palma (or whichever director was hired). The trappings of the TV series are little more than a gateway to what is in many ways unmistakably a Brian De Palma film, filled with double crosses, murder, some strange sexual politics, and much mystery and noirish atmosphere. Jim Phelps, the hero of the TV series, is later revealed to have survived the opening operation and is in fact the villain of the film adaptation. Most of Hunt's second team (other than Ving Rhames' Luther Stickell) are revealed to be turncoats, leaving Tom Cruise to save the day all by himself atop a speeding train in a scene that doesn't hold up very well 20 years later. What are fans of the TV series to make of this? The film was deeply unpopular with them on its initial release, and later sequels wouldn't so much subvert the trappings of the TV series the way this film does, as just ignore them. The point of this film is to be a starring action vehicle for Tom Cruise, with De Palma making the type of neo-noir he is mostly known for, using the TV series only as a vessel to do what he typically does. Using the ""Mission: Impossible"" name for a director to stamp his auteurist sensibilities all over it would become the hallmark of this series for it's first four installments.Despite alienating the show's fan base, this film actually works exceptionally well at what it sets out to do. The film looks gorgeous, bathed in shadows and old world architecture. The plot twists are enjoyably outrageous. The performances are largely good, and Cruise gets to shine in what would become known as his ""Teflon franchise"", which has managed to stay successful even after his star power self-destructed on Oprah's couch in 5 seconds. The film is also worth commending for having a script where the writers actually seemed to care about the story. This is where my criticism of its initial critics comes into play, and I noticed I'm not the only one who's taken to IMDb to point this out. Despite being maligned as convoluted and muddled (the film was actually nominated for a razzie award for worst adapted screenplay), the film deserves credit for assuming you'll be smart enough to figure out what's going on without overexplaining the action. It also deserves much credit for subverting it's source material to such an extreme degree. No, it's not muddled, you simply need to pay attention. How nice that in 1996 a summer blockbuster assumed you wouldn't turn your brain off while watching. How nice a film based on a well known property didn't pander to it's fans, but subverted their every expectation. That's rather rare these days, and now our multiplexes are filled with ginormous budgeted schlock who's plots are, well, muddled, and filled with cheap ""fan service"". David Koepp and Robert Townsend wrote a smart script and were unfairly maligned for it. In the end, this film was the starting point for a series that took at least 15 years to truly find it's footing and hit it's stride. But it's a great start, and well worth watching.",Mission - Impossible
326,theveneficus,The ending needs work.,6,24 May 2016,"Tom Cruise always brings his best in any action role he plays, and this is no exception. This is the start of a great franchise. Unfortunately the final act is more than disappointing, its ridiculous. It ruins the entire tone of the film. It involves far too many betrayals, randomly appearing skin masks, and an over-the- top, unsatisfying action sequence. Like all action films it ends with a fight scene. But this one just doesn't have enough weight to be enjoyable. It involves a helicopter following a train through the tunnel connecting Britain to France. How a pilot would ever be able to avoid crashing is god's work. And overall the way Ethan Hunt (Cruise) deals with the bad guys is annoyingly too linear. He sticks a 'chewing gum bomb' onto the front of the helicopter jumps towards the train before it blows up, propelling him safely on board whilst his enemies burn to a crisp behind him. I wish the film had a more intelligent ending. Because despite the bewilderingly convoluted story it is a clever film. Mine (and most peoples) favourite scene, has Cruise suspending from a wire, whilst breaking into the most highly guarded building in Langley, Virginia (guess which place that is). That scene has everything, tension, humour, ingenuity and strong performances. There's two reasons I didn't give this film I higher score, 1. The ending is, by definition, impossible (maybe that's what they were going for, but I still find it a mistake), and 2. The plot is overly complicated (which trying to make intelligent) ends up being rather stupid. However, its still an enjoyable 110 minutes.",Mission - Impossible

The only thing that occasionally picks up the ball is Ving Rhames who seemes to provide the slick feel of the recent MI movies, nevertheless if you still feel like waiting around to you get to the vault scene and a few scenes here and there it's enough to get your pulse to pound and forget that dreadful ball and chain.",Mission - Impossible

I am a fan of the old Mission:Impossible series of the 60s and 80s and therefore I think the plot is ridiculous at best. Why should Jim Phelps do what he did? He was always loyal through the many episodes of the series and there he could have gotten much more money if he had betrayed his team.The reason why Peter Graves (Jim Phelps) did not star in this movie is because he did not agree with what I have just said.Anyway this movie is NOT for fans of the series because there is nothing left of the teamwork spirit of the series.

Ving Rhames and Jean Reno gets wheeled in, and I'm thinking 'okay, now we really got a movie here!'. Sadly I was disappointed. Ving Rhames spends his critical role in a back room somewhere, and Jean Reno is just a muscle henchman. I can't tell if I saw the plot twist coming or not, but it didn't surprise me or shock me even in the slightest, nor did the ending chase sequence, which was just all kinds of boring. The only redeeming quality this movie has, is the infamous break-in scene that has been copied to death at this point.What makes this a little strange is that this isn't a BAD movie. it's just that I found myself thinking after the movie was over, 'was that it?'. I don't need to be wowed with woosh-bang-massive explosions to enjoy a movie, but this plot seemed barely ankle deep.I don't know, maybe spy thrillers just aren't for me.

Someone is trying to kill off the original Mission feeling and replacing it with thick Hollywood effects, lightweight, conceited actors like Tom Cruise, and girls with fake boobs. Too reminiscent of James Bond or any other typical Hollywood wanna-be spy film. I'm so glad Peter Graves and most of the original actors didn't get themselves involved with this depressing movie.

However, it really missed the point of the original series. Mission Impossible was about a team of quirky and talented individuals, working together to overcome impossible odds. This movie is all Cruise, Cruise, and more Cruise. Taken by itself, it's great cinema. But it really has nothing to do with the group dynamic that made Mission Impossible such a special series. Maybe that's a sign of the times, which still continues today 16 years later - it's all about the superstar individual, rather than the team.

Also, some of the acting was sort of below-average, but Tom Cruise's performance of course made up for it. Its those type of things that make me dislike a film, but nevertheless the Tom Cruise-led spy flick was overall pretty enjoyable. The over-the-top stunts added suspense to the thrilling sequences. The action was pretty well-done. I will say that the stunts/action are unrealistic and sometimes even physics-defying, though. But Mission: Impossible was a very entertaining film, and I am looking forward to seeing the rest of the franchise. :)",Mission - Impossible
342,nickpal1983,Not great,6,17 July 2005,"There's no Bond in Mission: Impossible. Instead, the lead character is Ethan Hunt, the point man for Jim Phelps' IMF (Impossible Missions Force). Phelps (played by Jon Voight, not Peter Graves) receives assignment messages from his boss, Kittridge (Henry Czerny), via video transmissions rather than old-fashioned tapes. His group's latest job is to prevent something called a ""NOC list"" from falling into the hands of an international arms dealer (Vanessa Redgrave). If placed on the open market, the NOC list would put every United States deep cover agent in danger of exposure. However, when they embark on this mission, the IMF runs straight into an ambush where everyone is killed except Hunt and Phelps' wife, Claire (Emmanuelle Beart). Because he survives the carefully-orchestrated massacre, Hunt is suspected of turning traitor.Fans of the TV series expecting a faithful translation may be disappointed. Except for a few nods to its small-screen predecessor, this Mission: Impossible is a vastly different, autonomous entity. Nine years ago, director Brian DePalma used a similar approach for a superior version of The Untouchables, but lightning hasn't struck twice. Teetering on an uncertain edge between action flick and thriller, Mission: Impossible doesn't succeed well as either. There are some high-energy moments, but none offers more than a moment's edge-of-the-seat excitement. Too much of what happens in Mission: Impossible comes across as fait accompli.The predictable plot generates little interest. It's pathetically easy to guess the mole's identity despite the screenwriters' attempts to obscure the issue. The overall storyline contains a legion of gaping holes -- the more you think about it, the less sense it makes. Weak character identification allows Twister to seem like a masterpiece by comparison. In fact, taken as a whole, Twister is a significantly more involving spectacle.",Mission - Impossible

I wanted to see the last movies like Rogue Nation, but I've decided to start with the first.When you watch a movie like this in 2016, 20 years after it's release in 1996, you'll find so many things funny, not a lot of explanation and unrealistic, impossible scenes, but if you remember that this was the way movies were made back then, you'll enjoy this film.Almost everything is predictable in this movie, the plot, the action.

350,lyoz,best spy movie,10,20 February 2003,"IMHO this is the best spy movie ever. The movie derives its power from a fine mix of action, suspense, thrill, special effects, and an amazingly crafted *impossible* mission. All the characters fit in their roles well. It all starts as a regular spy mission movie, but the unbelieveable turn of events leave the viewers as much amazed as the main characters. The slow recovery from this initial shock, the pursuit of truth, the missoin, the revelation, the hope/love/belief, and the grand finale; all of it has been well knitted in a single fully flowing hellufa movie.This movie is far better than its all-action'n'stunt-jon-woo MI2.

Theres a lot more to it. The second film is all hyped up on tricks and stunts and special effects, which can be appealing, but the first film makes you think.

352,incrediboy-4,Not bad!,6,5 December 2008,"Not too long ago, I finally watched this film. If you want to know, is it worth to watch it, then the answer is - yes. The genres of this film: Adventure, Thriller, Action...It's not funny, people. There HAS to be only one and main genre ""Fantastic"", not in Sci-Fi meaning, but only as a fantastic. The scene at their first impossible mission was very badly filmed, I laugh a lot, while watching it. The technology for their time(which is in movie), is something unbelievable, and in this meaning this movie is also Sci-Fi. But the most greatly filmed, played, created and funny was the last scene with the helicopter. Mother God, how could something like that come to someone's mind...Really, I laughed a lot! The only thing, this film should be proud of, is a story and scenery(with everything, except the last scene, of course!), it could possibly be a greater movie, than it is, if it was filmed a little bit better and in some moments, not only ""a little bit""...Because the playing of actors were really good, I liked it. They can bravely go, and take their cockies from the shelf. And one more thing, in this movie is not much music, not so much, as it wanted to be! But that's only my opinion. If judge the film by the three main things : ""story, actor playing and by how movie is filmed"", then, I think it is worth of 6 stars! If you haven't seen this movie, watch it, and hope you'll like it!",Mission - Impossible

But I want to like this action franchise so here I go. Watching MI again, it wasn't as bad as I remember. Reminded me a lot of Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit. It's more of a espionage drama than a shoot out. It's also amazing to see how far this series has come over 19 years. The wire scene is still tense as ever and the final train battle is pretty cool. Ving Rhames is the tech guy which is really weird now since Simon Pegg is the tech guy. Watching them all go crazy over a floppy disc is funny. Tom fell right into the roll of Ethan which fits him perfectly. The film slows down in some parts but overall it's a solid action flick.",Mission - Impossible

355,consultant_liz99,Good film,7,27 January 2012,"Brian De Palma is known to be a wildly inconsistent filmmaker. From the over-rated Carrie, to the under-rated Snake Eyes, the classic Untouchables and the downright hideous Mission to Mars and Scarface, he's been through just about everything. But Mission: Impossible was his first true mega-hit. Movies from TV shows are a dime a dozen these days and are rarely taken seriously, I mean look at trash like S.W.A.T. or Dukes of Hazard, but M:I is actually supposed to be a continuation of the show, rather than a spin-off.Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt (no, not cockney rhyming slang) an IMF agent who's entire team is killed in a phony sting operation in Prague. Accused of being a traitor he legs it before they can nab him and assembles a team of rogue operatives to find out who the REAL traitor is. Many double-crosses and double-double crosses ensue.For those who cannot follow the plot there are some really good set-pieces with enough tension and excitement to carry the whole movie. You'll know by now the dangling scene in the top-secret room but the best scene in the movie is the high-speed train rocketing through the English countryside. While other directors might use this as a chance to show off, De Palma keeps it as realistic as possible which makes it infinitely more cooler.Parts of the movie may seem a bit dated now and it's weird seeing Tom Cruise look like a little boy even though he was already 33. He even sounds different. And what kind of supervillian uses floppy discs? They could have tried something a bit more high-tech there.The M:I franchise could be a heck a lot better, I suppose. The second film was terrible and the third merely average. But they're still better than the last few Bond outings, though it ain't quite up to the rugged quality of the Jason Bourne movies.",Mission - Impossible

This isn't an easy story to follow but it gets high marks for keeping it interesting despite that problem.The interesting characters, good cinematography, fun James Bond-like gadgets, just the right amount of action scenes and one very memorable heist scene with Tom Cruise dangling from a wire all make this an enjoyable two hours of entertainment. That scene with Cruise trying to break into this vault-like room remains as the one of the better tension-filled scenes I've ever witnessed on the big screen.The final action scene with the speeding train and helicopter also is very memorable. John Voight, Emmanuelle Beart, Henry Czerny and Jean Reno make it a fun cast to watch, too. Note: stick with this film and forget the sequel. D",Mission - Impossible

It's twenty-twenty-one, more than two decades since I last saw this film. I'd broken something inside my body, and wasn't feeling good; was meant to be resting, was meant to be in bed healing. I found this film, thought it was something I could start watching, start traipsing down memory lane with on my way to snooze land.Here's what happened...
I didn't traipse anywhere! And I'm still wide awake.There's a really strong story-line in this film, aside from a couple of clunky bits, but they're so easy to forgive when the cast is this brilliant, and its got Tom Cruise deep in there looking his boyish-cutest ever.And aside from Tom, this film's got the impossible to break-in to room, and lots of rubber faces, invisible cameras hidden in glasses, brilliant double bad-guys, and the scene in the... oh, ha-ha, that'd be a spoiler. No spoilers.No spoilers.The story raced - not a dull minute - and by the time I needed a bathroom break there were only twenty minutes to go. I would have visited the facilities but I knew, if I did, I might have got distracted and might have bailed on the rest of the film. I didn't want to bail, so I held-on against nature and saw the film through to the very end.And I got rewarded. I got a heart-thumping, fist-pumping, laugh-out-loud, cheering for the good guys finale. Yeah, I got a cliche, but it's great.So. To conclude.

Watching it a second time with that in mind, what was surprising to me was that all the pieces of this puzzle fit together somehow...despite a few minor plot holes and improbabilities, the basic thrust of the film retains a certain logic and solvability.  What's less surprising is how little this all matters. ""Mission: Impossible"" remains an average film dominated a few remarkable setpieces.  The film moves rather impatiently and hurriedly through its scenes of intrigue and doublecrossing (the real source of so much audience confusion) in order to set up its action scenes.

I have been a huge IMDb fan/supporter for some time now. That being said, I cannot believe how insulting you guys have been to Brian DePalma in your ratings of this movie. When one goes to ""Mission: Impossible"" reviews page, we see ""rating:6.6/10"" and ""user comments: In a word- Disgusting!"" According to your ratings system, ""The Punisher(re-make)"" is apparently on par with ""Mission: Impossible."" Are you kidding me? For those people who could not understand the plot of the movie...watch it again for the love of God and try paying attention (that helps). You have simply conformed to what you heard everyone else was saying before you saw the movie by saying you didn't understand the plot. Its OK. I forgive you. See it again and try to have keep open mind. The editing and the incorporation of the musical score is breathtaking, as is the directing and writing. Tom Cruise, Ving Rhames, Henry Czerny, and Jean Reno all deliver stunning performances. Between your ""6.6/10"" and ""In a word- Disgusting!"" the common movie fan who has not seen ""Mission: Impossible"" would get the impression that this is just a crappy re-make that is not worth watching, when in reality, it is a work of art.

The story, acting, and directing all are first class. I read that many people who have seen the movie for the first time were confused by the plot. So was I, but after screening it a second time I was pleasantly surprised at the many subtle nuances to the story there really were. It's a story that doesn't treat you like a child. So many movies (directors) think they have to go out of there way to spell everything out for the audience. Scenes that have no other purpose than to drive home an obvious point. Not this one. If I had my way Brian De Palma would have been involved in the other three. De Palma was the only one who captured the feel and the look of what I thought the movie should have been.

Also created is one of the most iconic images from any thriller of recent times Tom Cruise suspended mid heist inches from a pressure sensitive floor. Cruise lives up to his star billing and for me really nails the Ethan Hunt character, Jean Reno, Ving Rames and the stunning Emmanuelle Beart provide able support.My one problem with this film and unfortunately quite a big problem is that the twist in the tale can be seen coming a mile off.

In other words: it is very constructed, and you can sense it. For example, the way in the terminal room is MUCH too easy, I think in a TV episode the writer would have invented much more ""tricks"". The thing that might make the film hard to understand may be the way how the simple story is told...

In thought Sarahs death was lame. I didnt expect her to just keep walking towards the body. She was on the other side and had plenty of room to escape but still ended up dead. It wasnt a waste or anything because her character didnt have much to offer, but if it had been a character i liked, Id be disappointed in that lame death.
During the CIA invasion, Claire was so smooth and blended in great. Man when she injected the mans coffee I was impressed by how stealthily she did it and by her special pen.

The plot is too thick and twisty for an action movie (hence, all the confusion for the people who wanted an action movie), and there's too much mayhem and uncontrolled improvisation to work as a tight, suspense filled caper like the original series. For those who wanted an action movie, I'm told De Palma dumbed down the other MI movies, thus moving it further yet from the spirit of the original series.As far as an action movie goes, it's got plenty of action, but it's hard not to roll your eyes at Cruise surviving that bomb blast towards the end. Yeah, real good IMF-type planning there, Cruise. You planned on surviving that bomb blast and getting catapulted up to the next car all along, right? But what REALLY blows is the way De Palma ruined the premise of the series by making Phelps out to be the baddie. Don't let De Palma get a hold of ""Columbo"", or he'll have the lieutenant become a serial killer, with Tom Cruise, his partner, tracking him down in a car chase and killing him in some fiery explosion at the end.

We have followed him from when he formed the unit & his fatherly caring for his fellow agents, I feel that it was totally wrong & outside the character for his betrayal of IMF & his country. A way for the makers of the movie franchise to redeem themselves was to make a new movie in which it turns out that the Phelps that was killed in M.I. in fact was an infiltrator and that the real Phelps had been held captured thus the new mission was to rescue him and destroy his captors plans to implement their own perverted version of IMF. If Phelps was killed it really didn't matter as long as he was still a hero. He might die saving Hunts life thus there would be no conflict with a returning IMF leader.

The team consisted of Jim Phelps (Jon Voigt), his wife Claire Phelps (Emmanuelle Beart), Sarah Davies (Kristin Scott Thomas), Hannah Williams (Ingeborga Dapkunaite) and Jack (Emilio Estevez). The mission, to stop an American diplomat from selling off a NOC list filled with the identities of covert agents. With Ethan the only one of his team that appeared to be left standing found that the real mission was the attempt by his unofficial CIA organization to smoke out a mole. He is left to seek the truth by making some unlikely alliances and commit to steal the real NOC list and sell it off to the initial buyers to do some smoking out of his own.The theme of the movie revolves around the idea of the world closing in around someone and in the face of adversity to face it head on and see it through to the end. This can be shown in many action packed sequences in the film when Ethan takes a piece of exploding gum to narrowly escape situations where the audience is felt like he is backed in a corner with nowhere to go. There are other situations in the film where he is trying to prevent the world from closing in around him by placing his own traps to warn him of impending danger. Ethan the hero always tries to stay one step ahead of everyone so that the same repeat of misfortune doesn't rear its ugly head.Mission Impossible falls in the lines of action packed movies like The Bourne Identity or even James Bond movies, smart and inventive keeping audiences on their toes, trying to guide the viewers to think one step ahead with the main character. To emphasize the action in the scenes Mission Impossible incorporates both slow motion and fast paced motion. When Ethan escapes the restaurant after meeting with Kittridge (Henry Czerny), the stick of exploding gum is thrown against an aquarium creating a diversion that follows a slow motion scene of him escaping unharmed. When Ethan is chasing the villain trying to escape from a high speed train to a helicopter, he stops at nothing to make sure that good prevails. Once again the exploding gum saves the day when the helicopter pilot tries to decapitate Ethan with the blades of the helicopter. This sequence, as unrealistic as it seems, is made realistic with the wind whipping the actor's clothes and hair while the background zips by. The sounds are brought to life with the thunderous noise of the train on the tracks, the wind and the helicopter following close behind.The movie isn't a part of my favorite genre and sometimes find myself having to see these action films more than once because there is so much going on. I did like the movie but I can't say it's one of my favorites. It definitely is a must see and recommend it to anyone who wants to see a good movie with a good plot and action packed.",Mission - Impossible
384,Jinglheimer,I could not stop laughing at the opening guy hanging onto the mountain by his little finger,4,14 November 2008,"Be HONEST. Was I the only one laughing??? After I started laughing and others could tell that I sincerely found it hilarious, the entire theater was filled with laughter. I think however if I had not started the ball rolling with the laughs and chuckles in that theater, (finding this beginning so preposterous that I honestly did not even try to conceal my inability to believe it), the folks might have just dumb-foundedly sat through the rest of the picture as usual. Had a real good time but I do believe that the director was just a little over the top with what he was trying to convey in that opening scene (probably that and this is what the guy does just for fun). The saving grace here is the title. On the whole, the movie was of course very good however and does deserve all of those stars. I'm a big Jon Voight fan since ""The Champ"" which has to be one of the best movies and performances of all time.",Mission - Impossible
385,Ted-liebert,"Rename this movie, it has nothing to do with Mission Impossible series",1,30 May 2013,"Can you imagine seeing a Star Trek movie where Captain Kirk becomes a traitor? Or how about The cookie monster a child abuser, or Luke Skywalker becoming evil? What about Mr. Rogers on the 10 most wanted? That's the kind of nonsense this movie peddles. It is total garbage. And is not a mission impossible story at all. Sure the movie is fine but give it a different name and don't steal any themes from the true mission impossible story. If you are not a mission impossible fan you will find this movie exciting.....but not if you are a true Mission Impossible fan. This is worst then terrible, and obviously not written by someone who understood the series. Rather promoted using the IMF name, music, themes, but not the heart and soul of this great series. I can't imagine the outrage if they did this to Star Trek or had a sequel to the Walton's and now John Boy turns into a death row criminal. The fact someone tried this with our beloved series just goes to show that double espionage can be tried, but we know better and know this is not really mission impossible but an impostor!",Mission - Impossible
386,Doots12,I loved it!!!!,10,6 November 2005,"this was a great film and especially with tom cruise in it!! :)i thought they did a really good job with all of the stunts that he did.also, they did an excellent job with the masks. all they really did need to fix was the part when the guy sneezed because that always happens and it is way to predictable if they do that.another reason that the movie was so good was because it had twists in it so that made it hard to figure out what was going to happen.some of the weapons were pretty good to like the bomb that was in disguise as an ordinary piece of gum. the only unrealistic part in it was when he was on the train and the helicopter went skidding and just missed him. it would take much longer for something that huge to slow down.",Mission - Impossible
387,ben-latimer,Not at all complicated,10,14 July 2005,"People always complain about how excessively complex this film is but it ultimately just boils down to a simple betrayal story. People seem for some reason to have particular difficulty with a fantastic scene in which Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise)verbally agrees with someone trying to deceive him as to earlier events in the film, whereas what DePalma presents us with visually are the images going through Hunt's mind as he pieces together how the events actually occurred. Very original, great directing and acting. People moaning about how difficult this film is probably led to the atrocity that is MI2 - all action, and a stupid, dumbed-down plot",Mission - Impossible
388,chrissmith-67493,Very good movie,9,29 December 2015,"A very good movie of which was very well crafted. For an older movie there was some very good action scenes and also some scenes of tension within the movie. For example Tom Cruise dangling on a wire in a vault. Also the ending scenes with the chase, was very tense and made me sit on the edge of my seat which is very rare for me, it just makes you want them to succeed at the end, and you can really feel what each of the characters are going through, which in my opinion is key to a great movie. After watching this movie it just makes me want to watch the next one and the one after that as if it can live up to this movie they will be just as good. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes action and tension as it has plenty of this.",Mission - Impossible
389,navtejthakkar,comment on the robbery of NOC list sequence,4,26 November 2005,"Hi saw the movie a few times in bits and pieces.. will try and get hold of the transcript...on of these days.. last week again had the opportunity to catch the movie on HBO.. while watching it a doubt occurred to me.. though I am wondering why it didn't strike me earlier..Now, I am talking about the robbery of the NOC List. This sequence where TOM Cruise is suspended in the air by means of a rope. The area is a high security area to which access is available to the authorized official only after thorough checks of voice, eye retina etc. of course the access cards. The point is that its a high security zone.Now me doubt is if its such a high security zone owing to the presence extremely sensitive data, why aren't there any cameras in the room..Or is that the cameras have been de activated which I probably missed.indeed if there are no cameras, why is that so..I mean even in a Small grocery store, we find cameras which are being continuously monitored to avoid cases of shoplifting..can any one throw some light.thanks",Mission - Impossible
390,alto_saxophone,I was very disappointed,1,30 May 2006,"I'm a huge fan of the original Mission: Impossible television series on which this was based. When it was announced that a movie version would be made, I naively got very excited with anticipation of seeing it. I read every scrap of information published about the movie before its release. However, when I saw it, I was very disappointed. This wasn't Mission: Impossible at all but a Tom Cruise action vehicle. I never bothered to see any of sequels. It's too bad that a whole generation of movie goers will think that THIS is Mission: Impossible without ever having seen the brilliant television series. It doesn't surprise me that Greg Morris walked out in the middle of this film and said ""It's an abomination."" Because Tom Cruise has tainted M:I's image so badly, no one will ever make a television show or motion picture that faithfully captures the essence of M:I... at least not during Mr. Cruise's lifetime or mine. Thanks a lot, Tom.",Mission - Impossible
391,alexmemus,The vault scene is still amazing.,8,28 June 2018,"This movie is not really smart, with oversimplified characters and CGI that didn't age well. 
But it's still so fun to watch. Tom Cruise often breaks the character, but his energy is simply amazing. The vault scene is filmed with precision and visual flair (it almost has Kubrick's vibe). And the train scene is so stupid and still fun (now I get why later Tom Cruise would do his airplane stunt). 
And the main theme. Marvel, just learn how to create a memorable tune.",Mission - Impossible
392,rish-96900,Best Detective Franchise,10,18 September 2016,"It is one of my favorite detective movies where the journey of Mission Impossible begins. Tom cruise is pretty amazing .

The picture contains a bit of romantic scenes too.The movie is full of suspense too.Tom cruise name ""Ethan Hunt"" has been copied from a police officer in the United States.His fighting skills are awesome. #best is yet to come MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 7.",Mission - Impossible
393,mathiasknutsson,Worst movie ever,1,29 June 2021,"Growing up in the eighties mission impossible (the remake) was one of the most exciting and enjoyable shows shown on TV. Peter Graves charachter, Jim Phelps, was responsible for assembling a team of professionals and execute various kinds of dangerous missions involving disguises, stealth and you name it. It was ONLY thanks to every single team members skill that they were able to pull the missions off.Thus expectations were high when going to the theater to watch this film. And they totally blew it! It seems they were out to destroy the legacy of the two series on purpose. Not only does the entire team, except Tom f-in Cruise, die within minutes and then the rest of the movie turns into a one man show. The main antagonist turns out to be Jim Phelps, no longer played by Peter Graves (though he was alive at the time). Instead Jon Voight plays a character with the same name but none of the traits held by the original character. There is no way the loving, care taking charachter Jim would off his entire team for monetary reasons. Having completed so many extreme missions in the past he would surely already have more money than king Midas. What a f-in disgrace and insult this movie is!",Mission - Impossible
394,jonnyjew,Takes a few times watching to fully grasp it,7,20 June 2017,"Maybe I just don't know the inner workings of heist jobs... but I was confused on some of the details until I watched it 3 or 4 times. Its a complex, very interesting story... The thing I liked about it even the first few times (even though it was confusing), is that I felt like I was thrust into the spy/heist life overnight and had to try and keep up. Which made Tom Cruise's character feel even more in charge and smart to me as a viewer. None of the other mission impossibles come even close to touching this one! MIght even go as far as to say its a masterpiece of this genre. Only marking it down to 7 instead of 8 or 9 because of my forced multiple viewings to fully grasp it!",Mission - Impossible
395,mizuryusquirtle,I liked this movie,9,28 February 2006,"I Really liked this movie. It's the only one of the Mission Impossible series that I've seen, the plot was sort of hard to understand at first but it had me entertained the whole way through. It has some great scenes, for example early on I really enjoyed that first mission in the fancy ballroom. Later on when they lower Tom Cruise in from the ceiling is definitely memorable, too. I'd compare the camera work to Alien, but filming spies instead of spaceships, of course. The music is great, the beloved theme song is widely known but really fits it's source well. I recommend this movie for watching at home, it's got plenty of action but it never made me uneasy, just in awe a bit. A great movie to watch casually.",Mission - Impossible
