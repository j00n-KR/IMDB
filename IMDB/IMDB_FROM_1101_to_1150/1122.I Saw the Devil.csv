0,Leofwine_draca,One of the grimmest films ever made,8,15 January 2012,"I'm a huge fan of recent South Korean cinema (THE MAN FROM NOWHERE is one of my favourite films of all time) so needless to say I jumped at the chance to see I SAW THE DEVIL, the film everyone is talking about. Surprise, surprise, it turns out to be every bit the fantastic thriller that everyone says it is, and also one of the most explicit films I've ever seen in its depictions of sex and violence. Definitely not a film to watch with your auntie, then.Byung-hun Lee (A BITTERSWEET LIFE) is well cast as a government agent who finds himself on the trail of a supremely sadistic serial killer when his pregnant wife is murdered. Said killer, Kyung-chul, is played by OLDBOY's Min-sik Choi as one of the most disturbing killers I've ever witnessed: this guy is the embodiment of evil, an utterly heartless, cold and calculating pervert who thinks nothing of raping and murdering on a whim.What follows redefines the cat-and-mouse thriller genre, with the good guy on the bad guy's tail and moralities shifting and blurring as both are drawn into a deadly game from which nobody can come unscathed. It goes without saying that the writing and direction are flawless. Graphic scenes of torture and various other unpleasantness litter the film like roadkill until the powerful, inevitable climax, yet somehow the violence never feels gratuitous. While I didn't find this to be quite as good as THE CHASER – that's the film which introduced me to modern Korean cinema, so it has a special place in my heart - it's certainly up there as one of the most unflinching serial killer movies of all time.",I Saw the Devil
1,SnoopyStyle,blood splattering fun,7,16 July 2016,"Minibus driver Jang Kyung-chul (Choi Min-sik) finds Joo-yeon, daughter of a retired police chief, stranded on the road. He offers to help but kills her. Her ear is found by kids. The police find her body chopped up. Her fiancé Soo-hyun is an NIS agent and gets the names of 4 suspects. He brutalizes the men to get them to confess while Kyung-chul continues to kill. He finds evidence of Kyung-chul's guilt. He fights him but lets him go. He had put a tracker in Kyung-chul.The first part is solid serial killer movie. When Soo-hyun lets Kyung-chul escape, it confused me about his motive. It goes into a fascinating confusing mayhem. It has some splatter fun. It's a little bit of Saw. I still don't understand why he let the killer go. It seems like a complicated revenge plot. He should at least chop off his hands or something fun. He's giving the killer too much of a chance.",I Saw the Devil
2,claudio_carvalho,The Personification of Evil,8,23 September 2016,"When Joo-yeon (San-ha Oh) has a flat tire on the snow, she calls the tow truck to help her and calls her beloved fiancé Kim Soo-hyeon (Byung-hun Lee), who is a secret agent, to kill time. Out of the blue, a man offers to help her and Joo-yeon refuses. But the man breaks her car, abducts her and dismember her body. Her father, who is a retired chief of police, gives the data of the four prime suspects to Soo- hyeon and he asks two week off to his chief. He hunts the men down and when he finds that Kyung-chul (Min-sik Choi) is the killer, he promises a dreadful to revenge against the killer to make him suffer as Joo- yeon did. Soo-hyeon becomes a monster and begins a cat-and- mouse game, capturing and releasing Kyung-chul wounded many times. But the serial-killer is the personification of evil and makes Soo-hyeon regret for not killing him when he had the chance.""Ang-ma-reul bo-at-da"", a.k.a. ""I Saw the Devil"", is a brutal South- Korean thriller with a story of revenge. The plot follows the creepy line of ""Seven"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"", but Kyung-chul makes John Doe and Dr. Hannibal Lecter seem to be in the kindergarten of crime. The viewer does not feel the 2h 21min running time of the suspenseful and haunting story. The direction, performances, cinematography, camera work, locations, resuming, everything is top-notch in this film. Fortunately there is no American remake of this film. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Eu Vi o Diabo"" (""I Saw the Devil"")",I Saw the Devil
3,nogodnomasters,Korean rape slasher,7,16 April 2018,"The soundtrack starts out like this is a cheap Italian movie. It gets better.The movie starts out with a woman stranded on a highway in the snow. She has a wrecker coming and is talking on her cell to her husband, a secret agent who watches Liam Neeson films. He is also conducting business. At one point he excuses himself to go to the restroom so he can sing to her on the phone. The next thing you know she is bludgeoned and dragged to a location where she is stripped and chained. The man doesn't torture her, just simply kills her. We find out that not only is he a psycho, but generally socially dysfunctional.Her husband takes a leave from work and goes and plays ""Dirty Harry"" on every Korean pervert until he finds the killer in the act of raping a girl. Apparently the killer disrobes, rapes and then murders his victims, although he kills men too. He stops the rape and beats up the killer, but lets him go. The killer now has a bug and tracking device on him. Our Korean Dirty Harry is able to follow him around. When the killer/rapist is in the middle of an act, our Korean Dirty Harry shows up, beats the guys up and cuts on him. He is now wearing a soccer jersey so he can claim he got his wounds playing soccer in order to get medical attention, perhaps intended as a joke.Nudity and rape, although the rape scenes are far less graphic than our 70's films. The translation was rather smooth and kudos for some originality.",I Saw the Devil
4,kosmasp,Evil inside,9,4 December 2011,"How does the Devil look like then? I'm not sure I can paint you a picture or that you will be able to paint one, after watching this movie. The (ambigous) experience you'll have, will either leave you with a bitter aftertaste or ""overjoyed"" because of the movie experience you just had. I know it is a difficult film (starting with a troubled lead), that might not speak to you directly or show your point of view. It may offend you (probably), but it won't leave you without thought!It's another Korean masterpiece, with superb acting, great plot points and a visual style (and violence) that take it to another level. A very tough watch that is well worth your time!",I Saw the Devil
5,rmax304823,"""Revenge is for the movies.""",7,18 October 2017,"A beautiful, young Korean woman has car trouble on a deserted road at night. A car stops, the driver offers to help then breaks through the window, bludgeons her with a hammer, takes her to his filthy room, tortures her. ""I'm pregnant. Please don't kill me."" she manages to gasp. The middle-aged maniac looks puzzled for a second, then asks, ""Why not?"" The police find her dismembered body in a creek. Her husband is a detective on the police force and gets two weeks leave, during which he captures the killer two or three time, beats him half to death, severs his Achilles tendon, and commits other unpleasantries.So far, in abstract, so lousy. I dislike slasher movies generally, especially those that are handled as if murder were a joke, and I hate the emerging genre of torture porn. It wasn't THAT long ago that ""Dirty Harry"" shot a suspect in the leg in the middle of Kezar Stadium and then stepped on the wound in order to squeeze out the location of a young girl the suspect had buried alive. That was nothing compared to this.Yet, dare I say it? Despite the bathtubs of blood, the screams of horror, the terrible poundings, this is pretty deftly done. It avoids the usual clichés of horror and suspense. When a glass crashes and there is a loud sting on the sound track and it's just the cat, or when a hand reaches out for someone's shoulder and she jumps in fright and there is a WHAM on the sound track, or when a helpless woman takes a flashlight and investigates some curious noises in a dark and dangerous place -- well, none of that is to be found in ""I've Seen the Devil."" Nor does this young, handsome Korean Dirty Harry (Byung-hun Lee) come away from his plan with any taste of victory. His extra-legal pursuit and torture of the maniac has led to the murder of his wife's family. He'll be fired, taken to court, and he's accomplished nothing that could not have been accomplished with much less bloodshed and tears. Aside from the initial discovery of his wife's body, the only time he shows any emotion is in the last shot when, standing alone in the middle of a road, he breaks into searing and cathartic sobs.I think I'll give this one a pass, even though I loathe seeing people suffer. It's well acted, for one thing. The serial murder (Min-sik Choy) has the juiciest part and handles it with some originality. With the exception of one or two scenes, the hero is wooden in comparison. It's also neatly directed -- nothing fancy, just some scenes that make you realize the director knows what he's about.",I Saw the Devil
6,BA_Harrison,I saw I Saw The Devil.,8,22 January 2011,"For your common or garden movie avenging angel, a bullet in the head is payback enough; others might go so far as to break out the meat-grinder or flamethrower. Nothing quite so simple for secret agent Dae-hoon, whose plans for revenge take vigilantism to a whole new level: after his pregnant wife is butchered by psycho killer Kyung-chul (Min-sik Choi), Dae-hoon vows to make the murderer experience ten-thousand-fold the pain suffered by his missus. Taking a fortnight off work, he plays a deadly game of cat and mouse with Kyung-chul, catching the sicko and torturing him, but letting him go afterwards to repeat the process time and time again.Directed by Ji-woon Kim (A Tale of Two Sisters, A Bittersweet Life), I Saw The Devil is quite possibly the most ferocious revenge drama that I have seen. From the initial abduction of Dae-hoon's wife, which involves the poor woman being repeatedly smashed over the head with a hammer, to the shocking climax which sees the emotionally shattered secret agent finally putting a very bloody end to his brutal game, Ji-woon Kim's film is a relentless display of human savagery designed to spark its audience's most primal emotions, something which it succeeds in doing brilliantly.Min-sik Choi gives Anthony Wong (The Untold Story) and Ben Ng (Red To Kill) a run for their money as the ultimate Asian nutjob, abducting, hacking and slicing his way through a series of victims with relish, and his convincingly demented performance will have viewers right alongside Dae-hoon as he dishes out his special brand of justice, not just to Kyung-chul, but also to a cannibalistic couple who share his passion for killing.With his film's running time clocking in at well over two hours, director Kim can be accused of spinning things out for a little too long, but with oodles of no-holds-barred gore, and even some sleazy sex thrown in for good measure, there is no denying that this film packs a powerful punch that won't be forgotten in a hurry.",I Saw the Devil
7,paul_haakonsen,And the devil looked back...,6,29 December 2015,"From the high rating on IMDb and Amazon, as well as the many praises, I had essentially expected a bit more from this movie. Now, don't get me wrong here because I am not saying that it is a bad movie. Far from that, actually.Story-wise then ""I Saw the Devil"" (aka ""Ang-ma-reul bo-at-da"") was a bit too simplistic. It is essentially just a revenge movie, and didn't have that many layers or complexity to it. It was bordering on being a bit too difficult to believe in the storyline events at times though.What made the movie enjoyable, watchable and worth spending time on was the phenomenal acting performances by the two lead actors, two of the heavyweighters of South Korean cinema - Byung-Hun Lee and Min-Sik Choi. These, to each their own, are amazing actors, but they really complimented each other so well on the screen.But not only the acting was the pulling point of the movie, but the raw emotion and brutality that permeated the entire movie, both visually on the screen and in the script and story.The effects in the movie were also quite good and very realistic. For example, the decapitated head found in the river was amazingly life-like and realistic. And the scene that includes a scalpel and a heel is likely to have you cringing in phantom pain.A different and brutal movie that might not fall well into everyone's taste. Good entertainment, although the storyline was a bit on the simplistic side and often appeared too scripted.",I Saw the Devil
8,Coventry,The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was linking his name to this stupendous horror/thriller!,9,11 July 2021,"While the Western half of the world (and Hollywood in particular) was still focused on making torture-porn horror movies with as sole purpose to show as many sickening, repulsive and shocking sequences as humanly possible, the Eastern part of the world (with South Korea as the usual pioneer) evolved to the next level already with ""I Saw the Devil"". In this fantastic film, perhaps one of the 10 best since the year 2000, the extremely explicit and uncompromising violence is only secondary to the character development and to writer/director Ji-Woon Kim's main message that revenge - contrary to popular belief - doesn't taste sweet at all, but sour instead, and that it leaves a horrible aftertaste in you mouth. You won't see that intensity and genius in a random ""Saw"" or ""Hostel"" sequel anytime soon...Both Choi Min-Sik and Lee Byung-Hun give away stupendous and almost unsurpassable performances. The former as a mad dog serial killer of the cruelest and most disturbing kind. The latter as a special agent turned avenging angel, and at least as cruel and disturbing as the killer. The difference between them is that young Soo-Hyun is driven to blinding rage when his pregnant fiancé falls victim to the sadist serial killer Kyul-chul. Her death so agonizingly painful that Soo-Hyun pledges that her tormentor will suffer just as much and just as brutally as she did. And so, an unspeakably tense game of cat and mouse ensues.""I Saw the Devil"" isn't entirely without flaws, though. The script often requires an enormous dose suspension of disbelief, and according to all laws of human anatomy and pain-endurance, Kyul-chul should have been dead 2 or 3 times. Personally, I really don't like it when horror/thriller movies have running times of more than two hours (which is also why it took me 10 years to finally see it), and even though the film is never boring, it wouldn't have hurt if it was 30-40 minutes shorter. Still, based on the numerous amount of powerful sequences, the nail-biting suspense highlights, the pure evilness of the lead character and the realistic (and often downright nauseating) gore effects, ""I Saw the Devil"" is one of the most unique films out there, and an absolute must-see for genre fanatics with nerves of steel and a stomach of concrete.",I Saw the Devil
9,michaelRokeefe,Revenge with no mercy.,8,8 June 2012,"Acclaimed director Ji-Woon Kim presents a revenge movie like no other. Intense, gory and over the top of decency. A serial killer flick that shows you what evil looks like. Secret Agent Dae-hoon(Byug-hun Lee)is late getting away from the office. His young pregnant fiancée having car trouble takes help from the wrong person. The attractive young woman becomes the latest victim of a vicious serial killer, Kyung-chul(Min-sik Choi). The secret agent takes two weeks leave of absence in order to track down the psychopathic killer and administer his wrath; going over the fine line between good and evil to revenge his fiancée's brutal death. Vowing the killer will feel all the pain she did and more.You will flinch and cringe and my even come close to losing your last meal. Revenge is liken to violence on steroids. Graphic scenes of slaughter. This white-knuckle thriller will take you on a grotesque and scary ride. Body chopping and plates of guts for dinner; this movie is not for the squeamish.Min-sik Choi portrays a villain you will not likely forget anytime soon. The average movie-goer is forewarned. But personally I enjoyed seeing the DEVIL; one Hell of a picture.",I Saw the Devil
10,morrison-dylan-fan,Tribute to Guy Morgan:I Saw the Devil (2010),10,11 March 2021,"A month before he suddenly passed away from a brain aneurysm at just age 46 on March 11th 2019,family friend Guy Morgan told me how he had just gotten into the ""Korean Revenge Thriller"" genre,with his favourite title from that genre being this one. Along with watching Guy's all-time favourite film The Thing (1982-also reviewed) again,I decided to pay tribute on the anniversary of his passing,by seeing the devil for the first time.View on the film:Crossing every moral line in the sand he had made in his years working for the secret service, Lee Byung-Hun gives an astonishing turn as Soo-hyeon, whose stomach Byung-Hun has weighed down by the sorrow from his loving fiancé Joo-yeon being killed, which drives his merciless line of revenge, that pulls Soo-hyeon deeper into the darkness left behind by Joo-yeon's murder.Cackling as he tortures his next victim, Choi Min-sik gives a chilling performance as Kyung-chul, whose brutality Min-sik has laughing back at those with compassion, with Min-sik wonderfully bouncing off Soo-hyeon's lone thread of moral standing, as Kyung-chul drags him into his darkness.Reuniting with cinematographer Mo-gae Lee & regular lead actor Lee Byung-Hun, co-writer/(with debut writer Park Hoon-jung) directing auteur Jee-woon Kim displays a startling, unflinching eye to the murder set-pieces, with Jee-woon and Mo-gae presenting each of them with a murky, visceral appearance, that cuts open across the screen the psychological torment Kyung-chul unleashes on his victims.Offering no easy answers to the heavily conflicted morals that Jee-woon would continue to explore in the excellent The Age of Shadows (2016-also reviewed),the screenplay by Jee-woon Kim and Park Hoon-jung superbly pair the harsh violence with psychological horror weaved from the blunt force mind-play between Soo-hyeon and Kyung-chul,as Soo-hyeon finds himself face to face with the devil.",I Saw the Devil

Ooo eee, ooo ah ah ting tang, walla walla, bang bang.",6,19 July 2019,"I Saw the Devil is certainly a unique experience, it doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense though.It's a decent foreign serial killer film, the characters good all round, though none exceptional. Some reasoning behind Jang's actions would be nice. The police are totally useless, five guys always standing there with stupid looks on their faces. I'm assuming the boss wanted Jang to be captured again, when he tells his unit to wait for no reason. Why pretend all of a sudden though, when they've done nothing all film.",I Saw the Devil
12,zetes,Dumb but a lot of fun,7,10 July 2011,"Demented thriller about a serial killer and the the man who is stalking him. Min-sik Choi of Oldboy plays the killer, a truly psychotic man who likes to pick up stranded women and beat them half to death before taking them home and dismembering them. Byung-hun Lee plays the secret service agent looking for revenge for his murdered fiancée. The twist here is that he discovers the murderer almost immediately. Oh, but he doesn't want plain old revenge. Far too good for such a man. No, instead he beats the everloving crap out of the guy and then lets him go - so he can seek him out and beat the crap out of him some more. It's incredibly stupid, really. Lee has to be the most irresponsible law enforcement agent ever. Sure, he's monitoring the guy (via a tracking device shoved down his throat while he's unconscious), but he always seems to arrive three seconds before the guy is about to kill someone else. So basically he's needlessly risking the lives of innocent people, not to mention his own - as soon as Choi discovers he's being followed, all he needs to do is get a gun - just to get off on some admittedly pretty sweet revenge. As dumb as it is, though, it's pretty friggin' entertaining. Sure, you have to have a strong stomach to take it - the film is extraordinarily brutal - but, if you have that, it's worth a look.",I Saw the Devil
13,trashgang,masterpiece,9,19 November 2012,"This movie was on my 'to watch' flicks for almost two years. Why I didn't watch it earlier I don't know. I watched of course the full uncut version to see it in full bloom and what a flick this was.A Korean horror directed by Jee-woon Kim who already knew his stuff with A Tale Of Two Sisters (2003). This is a must see for all fans of serial killers and who wants it the brute way like Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer (1986). Forget all so-called Hollywood flicks like Seven (1995) or even Silence Of The Lambs (1991) two smashers that look ridiculous against this gem. Naturally, it's the acting that makes it worth watching and the effects. The two main leads are done by Choi Min-Silk (Oldboy fame) as Kyung-Chul a serial killer and Lee Byung-Hun (A Bittersweet Life fame) as secret agent Soo-Hyan.When the daughter of the police commissioner Jang is being killed in brutal way by the psychopath Soo-Hyan promises for himself that he will take revenge. It's from the first moment until the end that you are taking a wild ride and one that isn't for the squeamish or easily offended because the killings and torturing are all done on-screen in full gore. This is really gore galore and some scene's are really for gorehounds because heads will take a lot of smashes in this flick.I was rather surprised that a lot of nudity was seen here in I Saw The Devil and even some blurred porn. If you can stand for example Irreversible (2002) or A Serbian Film (2010)or the French gore flicks made a few years ago then you sure will ove this one. Even as it clocks in over 2 hours it never becomes boring.For me this is a real gem.Gore 5/5 Nudity 1,5/5 Effects 5/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5",I Saw the Devil
14,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: I Saw The Devil,10,9 September 2011,"Heartthrob Lee Byung-hun (who was here in June recently for ScreenSingapore) plays Soo- hyun, an elite secret agent whose wife suffered the misfortune of being under the crosshair of serial killer Kyung-chul (Choi Min-sik of Oldboy fame), who brutally assaults and hacks her up. Promising that her killer will suffer an equally unsurmountable amount of pain, he embarks on a one man vigilante mission, with the help of his father-in-law, an ex police chief, to narrow down the list of suspects upon whom he delivers punishment without remorse, even for those who were not the culprits, but nasty people nonetheless.It's plays on the notion of how it takes a thief to catch a thief, and here, just what would one do when you have someone who has done you great wrong and caused unforgivable pain, in your sights and in your captivity. In most revenge flicks, the score's settled in one scene. Here, there's allowance like the monologue of any villain of a B-movie, where it's allowed to continue repeatedly, just so that one can dish out punishment repeatedly as well, thinking it can help to ease the pain, or does it? Maybe Batman fans will come to appreciate Soo-hyun's behaviour, and understand the thin line that the hero treads on, vying dangerously close to the tipping point where it's so easy to become the monster one is set out to capture, and how the act of vengeance alone cannot change anything.And what more when the villain is a sick psychopath with absolutely no morals, values, nor remorse felt, taking pride in taunting and boasting the sick things he had done. Choi Min-sik plays his character Kyung-chul to perfection, a live wire that can become explosive at any minute, armed to the teeth with weapons he doesn't wait to utilize, and a modus operandi that's effectively simple to execute, preying on beautiful nubile women just because he can. Choi Min-sik succeeds in making you hate the character, yet cringe in fear each time he appears on screen. It's the suspense built by the director which is top notch, allowing plenty of riveting moments where you'll be secretly hoping for Soo-hyun to show up each time, and save the day, only that Soo-hyun has his own hidden agenda to let the sickness continue, in order to deny the killer (just who is the killer and the devil here?) the pleasure that he seeks to gain.Which is what made this film pretty amazing in my books, as it explores how one doesn't necessarily get to win outright in this brilliant cat and mouse setup, where one doesn't know when to stop and let up, of getting into the kick of being in power and calling the shots. It presents this moral dilemma of how overconfidence and underestimation sets someone up for a fall, of trying to go one up against the other that nobody wins in the end, with what I felt was a terrible lose-lose situation either character suffered because they got in each other's way through fate, degenerating into the final act in pretty much tit for tat fashion. It's never conventional the way things develop in this story with its fair share of collateral damage in the story, which allowed for a number of side and supporting characters to extend the narrative a little bit longer, such as Kyung-chul's cannibal buddy entering the picture.Some may take a little offense at how indulgent this film can be with its violent scenes, since there are lingering, unflinching shots at some of the most gruesome ways one can violently pummel another human being in very direct methods which you'll rarely see on screen, and makes the Saw series look tame in comparison. Take a long a barf bag if you must, since there are many scenes of mutilation, bashing ins, dismemberment and the likes that will make you feel terribly uncomfortable, enough to put you into the shoes of the victims and feeling the kind of pain that is inexplicably caused, all just because you happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time, and trusting a stranger all too easily sometimes no thanks to circumstances.The edition shown here is the Director's Cut, or the International Version which is a lot more gorier than the Korean theatrical release which had to be tapered down, although the latter version did have a sex scene (which is one of the primary reasons for its longer run time) that added a little dimension as to the allegiance and clarity of a small supporting character who pops up midway through the film. It's a complete package of thrills and spills, with excellent production values all round and some of the best character actors in Lee Byung-hun and Choi Min-sik going up against each other already making the ticket price worthwhile, especially with Choi Min-sik coming out of self imposed exile from films will tell you something unique he sees in this film to want to do it.I Saw The Devil opens here on 15 September. Do not miss this, even if you have watched it somehow before, nothing beats experiencing it on a big screen. Definitely highly recommended as it goes into my books as one of the best in its genre, and of this year.",I Saw the Devil

Even the length, but that's forgivable considering just how good, all the time, this is. From the beautiful snowy opening that manages to combine magic and menace, to the thoughtful and anguished ending, this is one hell of a ride. The violence is truly awful yet impressively awesome in its magnitude while the invasive and uncompromising scenes of sexual depravity cannot but help to convey an appalling ambiguity. As I suggest, the length would normally inhibit me but I can assure anyone similarly put off, this is that good, bad and really weird you will not object.

17,namashi_1,A Bloodbath!,5,31 January 2014,"'I Saw the Devil' isn't really a film, its a bloodbath. The problem doesn't lie in its writing material, but the fact, that this film celebrates violence.'I Saw the Devil' Synopsis: When his pregnant fiancée becomes the latest victim of a serial killer, a secret agent blurs the line between good and evil in his pursuit of revenge.'I Saw the Devil' opens spell-bindly, but the brutal killings/torture sequences & rapes get on your nerves after a point. The protagonist's way of taking revenge is innovative, but is dragged a bit too much. Also, the excessive violence restricts its audience. Its strictly not meant for the faint-hearted! Park Hoon-jung's Screenplay is interesting in parts, but overall, is disturbing. Kim Ji-woon's Direction is no-holds-barred. He's made one of the most bloody films of all-time. Cinematography is atmospheric, while the Editing lacks sharpness.Performance-Wise: Lee Byung-hun & Choi Min-sik battle it out most convincingly. Lee is excellent as the revengeful hero, while Choi is despicable & fearsome throughout.On the whole, 'I Saw the Devil' relies primarily on violence.",I Saw the Devil
18,KineticSeoul,"Some great acting and lot of violence and some shock, but sort of a dull plot",7,25 December 2010,"Despite Byung-hun Lee's great acting, I didn't really find this film all that great. The most going for this film, is the shock you will get from the violence of this movie. I also never hated a villain this much so far until I saw this movie, maybe cause Min-Sik Choi did a excellent job. But I really despised the character so much that I enjoyed every minute he had to endure suffering. But despite the blood and violence of this movie, I just couldn't really enjoy it that much. Mainly cause the plot isn't very original and kinda dull at times. But it was very satisfying to watch little by little how the psycho rapist killer gets what he deserves. Overall this isn't the best revenge flick I seen from Korea, but it's alright.7.4/10",I Saw the Devil
19,Hellmant,One of those movies that really has you questioning 'what the heck you're watching'!,8,15 June 2011,"'I SAW THE DEVIL': Four Stars (Out of Five)South Korean slasher film from director Jee-woon Kim, the man responsible for such genre faves as 'THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE WEIRD' and 'A TALE OF TWO SISTERS'. Kim re-teams with actor Byung-hun Lee (who also starred in Kim's 'THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE WEIRD') for this tale of a secret agent bent on revenge against the sadistic madman who murdered his fiancé. The film also stars Min-sik Choi (of 'OLDBOY' fame) and was written by first time film writer Hoon-jung Park. It's relentlessly violent and extremely hard to watch but also very cleverly made and bizarrely fascinating. For fans of the filmmaker or horror movies in general it's a can't miss. Lee plays special agent Soo-hyun, recently engaged to marry Joo-yun (San-ha Oh). Joo-yun is the daughter of retired police Squad Chief Jang (Gook-hwan Jeon) and is expecting a child. When she's brutally murdered by a serial killer (Choi) Soo-hyun promises her father he'll stop at nothing to make the killer pay. He decides in order to accomplish this task he must become as vicious and relentless a monster as the killer himself. The line between right and wrong of course becomes very blurry as Soo-hyun goes down a path that will forever change him. The movie is even more disturbing than it sounds and about as violent a movie as any I've ever seen. It's also like nothing else I've ever seen before as well. Some will dismiss it as exploitative schlock but the filmmaking is breathtaking at times. The directing, cinematography and acting are all superb and the story takes you down a path you've most likely never been on before. I had no idea what to expect from one scene to the next or had any idea where the movie was going and I was quite shocked at how it all unfolded. It's one of those movies that really has you questioning 'what the heck you're watching'! I think that's a good thing.

21,Pjtaylor-96-138044,And the devil saw me.,7,5 September 2020,"Not for the faint of heart, 'I Saw The Devil (2010)' follows in the footsteps of 'Se7en (1995)' with its unrelentingly oppressive atmosphere and unflinching portrayals of the consequences of violence. The film follows an agent who goes after the serial killer who butchered his fiancée, performing a series of vicious captures and releases in the hopes of achieving 'true revenge'. The serial killer in question is one of the most diabolical ever put to film, so it's no wonder that things don't exactly go according to plan for our protagonist. Is he responsible for the deaths that occur after he releases the villain? Is it possible to 'break' a monster? How much of your humanity are you willing to sacrifice in order to try? These questions course through the core of the flick. You're never exactly aligned with the hero because you see the consequences of his questionable decisions, yet you most certainly want to see the villain punished in the most powerful way possible for his absolutely vile actions. This is the tug-of-war that exists at the heart of the picture's cat-and-mouse dynamic. It isn't explored subtly - in fact, nothing about the affair is subtle - but it is explored rather satisfyingly. Ultimately, it's left for the audience to ponder. The movie itself is almost always gripping; it sinks its claws into you early on and won't let you look away even when you're desperate to. Its violence truly is affecting. It isn't overly gratuitous (the most horrific things occur just out of frame), but it is absolutely harrowing. It really makes you aware of the brutality and, even, inhumanity of things you see in films all the time. As such, it isn't exactly a nice experience. Yet, it's exciting and engaging throughout. Sometimes, it almost feels like it's going to become too much to handle. This dynamic makes it difficult to rate; the fact that you genuinely don't like watching it is the very thing that makes it so well-achieved. It wants to make you uncomfortable, to get under your skin. In that, it wholly succeeds. It's potent. 7/10",I Saw the Devil
22,bowmanblue,I got this eventually,7,30 June 2015,"I'll admit it that it took me a little while to fully 'get' 'I Saw the Devil.' Perhaps I've been watching too many 'classic Hollywood' films lately and forgot that other countries do things differently.It's no easy ride and you're going to need a strong stomach to watch it all the way through. A serial killer, already wanted by the South Korean authorities, abducts and murders a young pregnant woman. However, this time he's gone one step too far, as the woman in question is related to South Korea's top secret agent. Okay, it was about here when I wondered how much I was going to enjoy this film. But, I overlooked the sheer convenience of this plot point and simply went with it.It doesn't take long before our South Korean James Bond has located his man, but he doesn't just kill him – too easy. He decides it would be much more fun to generally torment and torture him in a series of dangerous 'cat and mouse' games.Again, I did wonder why the secret agent didn't just kill the killer. Of course this would shave about 80% of the film's runtime off its total length! But, again, I overlooked that and went with it. And, I'm glad I did. Yes, it is a horrible film and full of very nasty moments, but it is certainly atmospheric and the serial killer is certainly someone you'll be dying to get his comeuppance. There's even a few moments of social commentary thrown in there to show that it's not just a mindless revenge flick.Naturally, it has subtitles, so you'll have to be okay with that if you're going to watch it. But, if you're in the mood for something dark, sadistic and violent, stick with it. It's a bit longer than most similar films, but you may just find it's worth it.",I Saw the Devil
23,gbill-74877,I saw the devil...,7,11 January 2021,"... but maybe I was looking in the mirror. This tale of cat-and-mouse revenge between a serial killer and a special agent whose fiancée was one of the victims plays out like male fantasy. One of the things it tries to show is that the overriding desire for revenge and bloodlust perverts the morality of the agent, but I don't think it probes this in a particularly deep way, which is unfortunate. It also gets in a few jabs of the ineptitude of the police (a head being fumbled out of a box comes to mind), but these punches are few and far between. Instead the focus is more on grisly torture, dismembering bodies, cannibalism, beheading, and various other forms of cruelty, so if you watch it, brace yourself. The action rarely lets up and it's engaging for all of its 141 minutes, I'll give it that. The performances from the two leads, Choi Min-sik and Lee Byung-hun, are strong, and director Kim Jee-woon tells the story with a certain flair. What keeps it from being great is that its story is too simple and its characters are too undeveloped. It seemed like it wanted it both ways - to revel in the violence and to be cautionary about how violence begets violence - and I think it ended up doing more of the former.",I Saw the Devil

Yet there is twist to this formula which i won't spoil. Killing were extremely visceral and brutal, so i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone with weak stomach or heart - be warner.Overall, although ""Ang-ma-reul bo-at-da"" was one of the most violent movies i have even seen, its also a good story and serial killer movie but with an interesting and well realized twist.

25,ironhorse_iv,"This devilish South Korean horror movie scared the hell of me! It's really, really disturbing.",7,19 January 2019,"Written & directed by Kim Jee-woon with some help from screenwriter, Park Hoon-jung. This psychologic thriller movie follows the story of NIS agent Kim Soo-hyun (Lee Byung-hun), whom vow to track down and seek vengeance on fame serial killer, Jang Kyung-chul (Choi Min-sik), by physically and mentally tormenting him, when his fiancée, Jang Joo-yun (Oh San-ha) was brutally murdered. Without spoiling the movie, too much; you really need a strong stomach to sit through this motion picture. It's really, really gory & unpleasant to look at. It's has a lot of glorification of violence, notably brutal cruelty against women. Because of that, the film had to be recut, several times, in order to have theatres be able to show it. A total runtime of eighty and ninety seconds of material was removed; including some explicit references to cannibalism & human bodies getting mutilated. Nevertheless, in international releases of this film, all of these bloody imageries were added back in, making this version of the demented cat & mouse game, a little more nauseating. I have to agree with some people, that it does borderline overwhelming exaggerated torture porn, a little too much. Certain scenes made me want to vomit. Nevertheless, with all these add ups, you would think the International version would be longer, however, surprisingly, it's still the Korean version. Why, because the international version did away a lot of sequences that the director deemed unnecessary like long establishing shots, some talking scenes and close up views of the protagonist and antagonist's emotional faces. However, I don't think, all these cuts for Western viewers, work within the film's favor. It kinda subdue the emotional weight & suspense, a little bit. Parts of the western version felt a little bit, emotionless & dry at times. Not only that, but scenes that supposed to be taken serious, are made to look silly, such as the moment, where the cops drop his fiancée's loose head, in front of him. While, the Korean version hold on the scenes, a lot more. Thus, allowing the depth of the crime, coming across, more naturally & tragic. Regardless, it's still, the International version that has the more powerful ending. While, the Korean cut focus more on the film's ending score, the international version shows the emotional heartbreak that the hero had to go through, as sounds of him, laughing, and crying is interlock with the music. You can tell by this version that the agent went too far with his game with the killer, that it broke him. Revenge cannot heal the inflicted pain. Regardless, both are viscerally engaging & beautifully filmed. The gore special effects and make up work were amazing. The murderous brutal actions look very realistic. It had that eerily voyeurism effect. Everything looks and feels painful. The action scenes were also top-notch. It was nice to see the NIS agent kick the living hell out of these evil beings! It was the only thing exhilarating in what is a downright dark & gritty depressing movie. Nevertheless, I just wish, the motion picture would had lightened up, a bit. Not everything in this world needed to be seem dangerous, sleazy, dysfunction, upsetting and downright bleak. Honestly, for good example, what was the purpose for the taxi ride from hell, scene? That battle with the thugs, felt like, really out of place & unrelated filler. Seeing a bunch of criminals, just so happen to pick up the killer seem a bit out there, too coincidence and somewhat unrealistic. Not only that, but one of the most hard to believe set ups in the movie, had to be the medical center scene with the nurse. The idea that the murderer can have one on one time with her, without any assistant, no other patients, no other doctors, bothering them, seem bewildering, not possible. To add on that, I doubt any rape victim would be willing to help heal her rapist & allow him to escape, just because the cop said so. Parts of the plot makes no sense! Not only that, but seeing the agent caught the killer again & again, just to let him go, got repetitive & tiresome quickly. Regardless of that, the acting in the film is pretty damn good, even if some of them, like Choi Moo-sung as Tae-joo does come across, as a bit over the top & corny. As for the two main stars; they really do seem to fit, their roles. Highly believable that one was special trained secret agent, while the other is a vile murderer, despite some moments of illogicality & inconsistency decision making. In the end, while, the movie is not that enjoyable. It did stand out, a little bit from all the clichés common slasher films; by introducing a game of one-upmanship. However, it could had been a little better. It's no 2003's psychologic film like 'Oldboy' that's for sure. Despite that, it's still worth seeing for some deranged artistic level. No wonder, why this South Korea movie was remade in Bollywood in 2014 as 'Ek Villain' and soon enough in America with the same name. It's one film, worth enduring for. It will surely freak you out.",I Saw the Devil

When one imagines taking the Law into one's own hands, one often finds one's self faced with the very likely harsh reality of doing some hard jail time; so, one hesitates, then reasons things through and, ultimately, foregoes vengeance. Movie characters, however, unhampered by Real World concerns, are able to dish it out with wild abandon. While I've never heard of a Real World avenger who followed through the way screen heroes do, it's always fun to imagine what it would be like. But I SAW THE DEVIL makes us squirm because it drives home the point that he who battles too long against dragons becomes himself a dragon in the end. The final, poignant shot of the hero leaves no doubt whatsoever.",I Saw the Devil
28,SAMTHEBESTEST,A monstrous psycho-killer thriller with the equally diabolical and matured revenge.,7,24 June 2021,"I Saw The Devil (2010) :
Brief Review -A monstrous psycho-killer thriller with the equally diabolical and matured revenge. I Saw The Devil is much better revenge drama than a thriller. It doesn't have much suspense to be called a good thriller but as a revenge drama it has much more in kitty than any other film of that genre. It's difficult to mange both the things Thrill and Revenge, somehow it's like a miracle which only happens once. That happened with 'OldBoy' (2003) and then there's nothing left for other thrillers to match the level. I Saw The Devil is a brutal revenge drama with that Korean realism which includes lots of blood-shed, violence, sexual material and unbearable cruelty. But additional element here is, it's not just about monstrous villian but it also provides the equally devilish properties to the main Hero who is hunting for the equally brutal revenge. The film is about a secret agent who exacts revenge on a serial killer through a series of captures and releases after the brutal murder of his beloved wife. Bollywood made 'Ek Villain' on the same story but failed to match the maturity and brutality so it was nothing but a fairly decent film. I Saw The Devil is 20 minutes longer than what it should have been. But thankfully it doesn't bore you with regular scenes. It has gripping screenplay and plenty of action to keep you hooked for 140 minutes. Coming to the acting departement, the pair of Lee Byung-hun and Choi Min-sik is absolutely brilliant. Forget rest of the cast, these two are treat to watch. You will remember this hero vs villain face-off for some time. Director Kim Jee-woon has done an amazing job as he kept the brutality intact with lots of entertainment, unseen psychosis and emotional connect. Overall, little less as a thriller but overwhelming as a revenge drama.RATING - 7.5/10*By - #samthebestest.",I Saw the Devil

I had to look away at many scenes. The violence is it's weak point of this movie, because this story didnt need to be this violent ALL the time, to have an effect. There has to be a balance between action and a story with characters. I would have rated this picture higher if it werent for the CONTINUOUS use of extreme violence, for which this director is known.This movie is a moral tale about revenge. Or isnt it? I hope it is, otherwise it would be nothing else but a rampage of revengeful violence committed by a man, whose wife was murdered by a serial killer.Direction, acting, editing, soundtrack are of the highest standard. The story in itself is shocking, but reasonably good, although it has got some silly credibility flaws, which might annoy the more attentive viewer. The continuous use of violence is way too much too handle though. There is just TOO much of it.

32,jtindahouse,A tense and gruesome ride not for the faint of heart,9,15 November 2020,"I read the IMDb synopsis for 'I Saw the Devil' - a secret agent exacts revenge on a serial killer through a series of captures and releases - and thought to myself if that isn't done right it could be very frustrating to watch. And it was frustrating. Probably the only thing that I didn't like about the movie was that I couldn't understand the protagonist's actions. There are so many ways to get revenge on someone, why do you have to release this man over and over and risk innocent people getting hurt? There, I've got my negative out of the way. Now let's talk about how great this film was.The opening scene in this film is incredible. The tension is palpable. Every time this movie tries to draw suspense, it does so in impeccable fashion the likes of which most horror directors could only dream of. It never feels like a horror movie in any way (you could maybe make an argument for it similar to 'The Silence of the Lambs' I suppose) but there are some moments that will make you jump out of your skin. Then the second scene in the movie is absolutely brutal as well, and from that point onward we as an audience know we are in for a ferocious experience.I love how detestable the bad guys in this movie are made to be. Nothing is done in half-measures. When you are dealing with a revenge flick it is so important to make us hate them as much as humanly possible. Every extra bit of hate we have equals extra satisfaction down the road.'I Saw the Devil' is so wonderfully made it's just a joy to watch. The film is admittedly very tough and gritty and won't be for everyone for that reason. But if you think you can stomach it then see it immediately, because this is a terrific film.",I Saw the Devil

34,dfranzen70,Do you love the sight of blood? Tune in....,7,20 March 2015,"The fiancée of a secret agent is tortured and murdered by a serial killer, and her would-be husband pushes the boundaries of his moral compass in order to exact his revenge. This South Korean horror drama is definitely not for the faint of heart, but it's very stylish and visceral. It has a lot of heart...and guts, and brains, and decapitations.Kim Soo-hyeon (Byung-hun Lee) takes a leave of absence from his job and sets out to find his girl's killer. With help from the girl's father, Soo-hyeon's retired chief, the agent is able to narrow the list to four suspects. He hits paydirt with number three - Jang Kyung-chul (Choi Min-sik), a horrific psychopath who kills for the hell of it and has cannibals for friends. Did I mention this isn't for the faint of heart? But when Soo-hyeon gets a hold of Kyung-chul, killing him or otherwise bringing him to justice isn't near the top of his to-do list. What follows is a grisly cat-playing-with-its-food game: catch and release, catch and release.This isn't about doing the right thing anymore, at least not if you're a normal, rational human being. It's about doing unto others as they themselves have already done did to others. Well, something like that. But Soo-hyeon and Kyung-chul have underestimated each other's tenacity and resilience - as well as the ability of either to disregard morality and collateral damage. Which is something you'd expect the veteran killer to do, but not really the secret agent man.Choi Min-sik starred as the victim in the classic Oldboy (not the Spike Lee abomination, the original), but here he's a nasty piece of work, a man with no problem with rape, murder, pedophilia, and so on. Say what one might about Kyung-chul's evil attitude, he's certainly not interesting. Never a dull moment with either of these characters, even as gallons of blood are spilled and bones are cracked and heads splintered. All in the name of good, clean revenge! I Saw the Devil is a transcendentally violent trip, with just the right amount of over-the-top horror that South Korean cinema has come to be known for. It's an unrated film, and it's almost two and a half hours long, and time seems to zip right by. Certainly not for all tastes, particularly those of a squeamish nature.",I Saw the Devil

36,MBunge,I'll definitely think about this film the next time I hail a cab,7,20 June 2012,"A coldly sick and violent meditation on limitless evil and all-consuming revenge, I Saw the Devil is made up of scenes chilling and electrifying. It also makes South Korea look like a place where you can't swing a dead cat without hitting two or three serial killers, something which can't have pleased the Seoul Convention and Visitors Bureau. With gorgeously menacing cinematography, a story that drills ever deeper into murderous darkness and a mesmerizing performance by Min-Sik Choi of Oldboy, it drags the audience into a universe of suspense and blunt depravity. There are a couple of unanswered questions that float through the story which might bother some viewers, but not enough to ruin the unnerving experience.Kyung-chul (Min-sik Choi) is a serial killer of women who makes a serious mistake when he butchers the pregnant fiancée of Soo-hyeon Kim (Byung-hun Lee), a government secret agent. Kim hunts down Kyung-chul, beats him, breaks his wrist and makes him swallow a tracking device. He thenreleases him. Then he catches him again, beats him, cuts Kyung-chul's Achilles tendon andreleases him. He catches him again, beats him andreleases him. Kim is pursuing a trail of vengeance that will force the killer to understand what his victims felt, but that gives Kyung-chul too many chances to outwit his enemy, with fatal results.Let me start with the two unanswered questions that might trouble people about I Saw the Devil. You've probably already figured out the first one from my description of the plot. How precisely is this revenge plan of Kim's supposed to work? Yes, he's trying to turn the hunter into the hunted but to what end? As the story unfolds, Kim never appears to have any actual idea of how his revenge is supposed to work or where he's ultimately leading Kyung-chul. The ending of the movie comes entirely out of Kyung-chul turning the tables on Kim. If that hadn't happened, how long was this game supposed to go on? And what was Kim planning to do with his fiancée's killer at the conclusion?The other unanswered question is, what's the deal with Kyung-chul? While the performance of Min-sik Choi is pretty awesome, he's playing an undefined and amorphous character. Is he crazy? Is he simply evil? Is he an amateur killer? Is he some sort of gangster tough guy? There's a reference to him being a militant of some kind and him abandoning his family, but no explanation of either. And if he's supposed to be the ""big bad"" of this film, why does he keep running into people who are more insane than he is? The movie really hinges on the relationship between Kim and Kyung-chul and if the latter is unknowable, it complicates the narrative.I consider those minor quibbles, however, that don't do much damage to an otherwise very good motion picture. You want gore and graphic violence? You want dynamic action scenes? You want emotionally affecting acting and confounding moral dilemmas? You want a film that just looks damn good? All of that is in I Saw the Devil. It's hard to say that watching a movie this dark and twisted is ever a good time, but that's what it was. There's a knife fight in a taxi that is one of the most incredible things I've ever seen in cinema. If all the rest stunk on ice, I'd still recommend it for that scene alone. I Saw the Devil is genuinely scary, creepy, unsettling and artistic. If that's your sort of thing, this is your kind of flick.",I Saw the Devil
37,kluseba,A perfect tale of revenge,9,13 June 2011,"This movie is probably the heaviest one I have ever seen in terms of mental and physical brutality even though I know movies that touch me even more. Anybody that has problems with torture scenes, cannibalism, violations and explicit sexual content as well as repetitive harsh language should stop reading here and lock for something else. Anybody else is invited to watch a movie about a monster you have never seen before.The movie turns around the question if one can and if so, how one could fight a monster. If two monsters fight each other can there be a winner and what are the consequences for other involved people. The movie hides in fact a lot of philosophical content and depth beneath the surface of blood and gore and is less superficial than it might seem at first sight.The movie is comparable to the story of the great Korean vengeance trilogy around ""Sympathy for Mister Vengeance"", ""Oldboy"" and ""Lady Vengeance"". It has the same harsh language and great acting as the Korean crime masterpiece ""Memories of murder"". It has the same philosophical content as the Canadian ""Les sept jours du talion"". Those movies can be references but this flick isn't comparable to any Hollywood production. This movie is also much heavier than any of the mentioned movies and something like that could only be a success in a country like Korea because it would be cut or banned in Europe or North America. Be sure to catch the uncut version no matter how high the price because it's really worth it.This movie doesn't only live from its shocking and gripping story and the numerous brutal scenes but also from the amazing acting. Choi Min-sik is one of Korea's greatest actors as he proved in ""Oldboy"" or ""Lady Vengenace"" but this time he is even more perfect than I expected. He plays his role with so much credibility and precision and is easily the best interpretation of a serial killer I have ever seen in a movie. Lee Byung-hun plays in a credible way a man that must become a monster to realize his promise and his revenge and he perfectly plays a broken person that goes through extreme changes. The other actors also deliver a more than solid job and remain credible. I must underline the acting of the weird cannibal friend of the monster and his strange wife (you should absolutely check out the deleted scenes).The director also did a great and very detailed job. The acting is perfect, the settings work very well and a great atmosphere is created. Kim Jee-won already created the dark, calm and mind-blowing masterpiece ""A tale of two sisters"" and he shows in here that he can also create a heavy, pitiless and extreme movie like this. I happen to estimate him higher and higher and want to check out the rest of his movies.In the end, this movie isn't maybe as gripping and stunningly original as my favourite Korean flicks ""Oldboy"", ""A tale of two sisters"" or ""Memories of murder"" but it surely is a movie you should check out if you like modern Asian cinema and if you liked the movies I've listed up in this review. It's a little masterpiece you won't forget after you have seen it and it's probably the best movie of the year to me. I would say that this movie underlines my opinion that the Korean cinema has become the best in the world during the last years.",I Saw the Devil

Kim comes perilously close to becoming the thing he hates.Some of the scenes are hard to take as Jang does not discriminate between adults and children, and there is cannibalism involved as well as a lot of blood.Naturally things don't go as planned, and there is a twist at the end.Outstanding drama.",I Saw the Devil
43,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,I Saw the Devil (2010),8,31 December 2011,"Korean's and revenge movies. They just keep joining forces. Here's the basic plot for I Saw the Devil, man kills woman, woman's fiancée comes after man. That's simplifying it, because this soon takes us into new, if fairly brutal territory. Our supposed hero quickly and easily finds the man responsible, and after beating him senseless, he leaves him in a hole with an envelope of cash. He's also placed a tracking device upon his person and this leads to our protagonist repeatedly hunting down the murderer and beating him again and again. This really emphasises the man becoming the monster that all revenge films kind of hint at. Here it is spelled out, in what we see and the dialogue of some of the supporting characters. As Soo Hyeon continues to release Kyung Chul, Kyung Chul is able to hurt more and more people. Soo Hyeon doesn't care about this, as long as his thirst for vengeance is quenched. Making Soo Hyeon so reckless in his revenge is what keeps us apart from him. Though he never really becomes a monster, just selfish. Rather than completely criticising revenge, it at times seems to suggest that you should just get the revenge over with as quickly as possible. Like many Korean films it has a wicked sense of humour, which is used to shock and also satirise the police. Once again they are incompetent, dropping a box with a victim's head in front of journalists and photographers. The film is brutal to begin with. I kept expecting the torture to end, but then calmly, it would cut back to the murder or clean up. This calm sensibility puts us in the mind of the killer. Lee is fantastic in his kickass role. You feel the anger and emotion and do care for his safety at first, but once he becomes too self absorbed you lose your connection to the film. Choi is incredible as always. He is terrifying without becoming a lunatic. His control over those around him is perfectly believable. It's an engaging film overall, though its morals are fairly mixed up at times, which is probably the point. It's biggest problem is being too long and repetitive and using too many plot holes as escape routes to further the plot. I could have done without the cannibal house scene, as this just made it seem like some fantasy serial killer forest where they all get together for parties.",I Saw the Devil
44,lewiskendell,Not for the faint of heart.,9,30 May 2011,"""Don't act so weak. This is just the beginning.""I Saw the Devil is a fantastic South Korean revenge flick. It's relentlessly dark, violent, suspenseful, bloody, and brutal. Not for everyone, but an excellent ride for those who can appreciate it. The movie is basically a cat and mouse game between a police agent and a sadistic serial killer. The agent loses his wife to the killer at the beginning of the story, and wastes little time tracking him down. But instead of taking him into custody or simply killing him, the agent has a much more elaborate plan for revenge. He lets the killer go and catches him repeatedly, inflicting more and more damage each time. Unfortunately, though, collateral damage quickly spirals out of control as the killer becomes more dangerous than ever as a result of the chase. I Saw the Devil isn't flawless. The performances are perfect (especially from Min-Sik Choi, the guy scared the crap out of me), and the cinematography is memorable, but the plot takes a few infuriating twists for the sake of drama that hurt the movie much more than helped. With that said, this is still probably the best serial killer horror/drama flick that I've seen. It's just relentless, and often immensely satisfying.",I Saw the Devil
45,bkrauser-81-311064,I Saw the Devil and I Didn't Like What I Saw,2,13 November 2011,"""I Saw the Devil"" has got to be one of the most violent, grotesque and masochistic films I have seen in a while. The film is less an experience than it is an endurance exercise for your stomach. Supposedly the point of the film is: revenge is destructive and inherently evil yet it takes great relish in exposing every gory detail of its outlandish story.The story begins with a young woman waiting on the side of a snowy road for a tow-truck. As she calls her secret agent fiancée Soo-Hyun (Lee Byung-Hun), a mysterious man offers help. What occurs next is an episode of violent assault and brutal murder that never skims on the gory details. After her body, or rather body parts are recovered, Soo-Hyun takes a few weeks out to track down the supposedly elusive killer. Once he catches up to him however, instead of informing the authorities or killing him, he puts a ludicrous master plan in motion that can be best described as a farcical indictment of ""catch and release."" The stunning amount of violence and gore especially towards women is repulsive. Instead of letting the audience use its imagination or letting the cameraman use discretion, jugular spurting, tendon slicing and mounds of mutilated body parts are on full display. The victims of such bloodletting are treated so harshly and diminutively that even the survivors are disrespected and discarded like rag-dolls. At one point Soo-Hyun, after beating serial killer Kyung-Chul into submission, tells one of his victims, a nurse ""don't leave you'll need to heal his wounds."" Excuse me?! I doubt a rape victim would be much inclined to cauterize the wounds of her rapist then leave him in the middle of nowhere to strike again.Soo-Hyun is so focused on his plan for revenge that he ends up paying a terrible price thus the moral of director Jee-Woon Kim's story; revenge is bad. But how strong is that moral when those interested in watching want to for prurient amusement? When I watched ""I Saw the Devil"" I did so with a friend. He had a much different reaction. While I was disgusted with the film, he thought the bashing of a victims skull with a pipe was worth a clever comment and breaking a man's jawbone was oddly hilarious. As the credits rolled he claimed I just didn't ""get it."" A statement that I find oddly hilarious.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",I Saw the Devil
46,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""I Saw the Devil"" is a deeply disturbing portrayal of vengeance and heartbreak that wows the audience and delivers a fantastic tale, despite some big flaws...",8,30 May 2012,"The 2010 South Korean film ""I Saw the Devil"", as directed by Kim Ji-woon, is one of the strongest revenge-tales in cinema of the past decade. Through incredible visuals, outstanding performances, and effective use of music, it is an absolutely awe-inspiring visual piece, that delivers a compelling and emotional story, despite some obvious large flaws.Soo-hyun (Lee Byung-hun), a South Korean secret agent, learns that his fiancée has been murdered by a serial killer who stashed her body all about on a field and in a stream. He vows revenge to her police-chief father and sets out to find the killer. After following the leads to several other suspects that he tortures for information, Soo-hyun finds the real killer- a deranged man named Kyung-chul (as played devilishly by Choi Min-sik of ""Oldboy"" fame). Soo-hyun finds Kyung-chul and beats him within an inch of his life, crippling him and implanting a GPS tracking device in his stomach. He gives Kyung-chul the news- he will continuously torture and disable him, then eventually kill him.What follows is an incredibly tense game of cat and mouse, as Soo-hyun continues to track Kyung-chul, and the tables are repeatedly turned as both men continue to gain the upper-hand on one-another. In addition, Soo-hyun's own moral ambiguity is tested and he is forced to face the consequences of his quest for vengeance against the man that killed his fiancée.The performances are all knocked out of the park. Lee Byung-hun is a revelation as our sort-of anti-hero, and he is able to bring a lot of subtlety and pathos to the role. While he is very quiet, calculated and stoic, you get these fantastic moments where you can see his inner-turmoil sort of ooze out of his subconscious for brief instances, and it gives a lot of power to his performance. Choi Min-sik as Kyung-chul is yet another perfect performance for Min-sik's catalog. Everything about Kyung-chul is disturbing, loathsome and purely evil. He ranks up there with Heath Ledger's Joker and Denzel Washington's Alozo Harris as one of the best villains of the past 20 years.Kim Ji-woon's visual direction is near-perfect. The film makes great use of camera placement, moves and style to the use of textures and lighting. This is an expertly crafted film from a visual standpoint. In addition, the music and the mood it sets perfectly compliment to those visuals, elevating them to an unseen power.That praise having been said, there are some problems with the film, which do drag it down a point or two.The main problem with the film is the pacing and the way the script moves. The film is around 140 minutes, and of that, nearly two hours is spent on the intricate cat-and-mouse game between the two leads. And while it is genuinely suspenseful and masterfully crafted, it does have a degree of redundancy that becomes grating. For much of the film, the same basic format is followed- Soo-hyun finds Kyung-chul, there is a tense confrontation, and a fight breaks out. Soo-hyn manages to beat Kyung-chul, dumps him somewhere, and the scene is repeated again. It almost felt like a demented Road-Runner/Coyote cartoon at times. There is little change-up to the formula over the runtime, and it became a little tiring seeing this sequence of events play out a good 4 or 5 times. However, as the film continues, and the power shifts and evens out between the two men, this redundant cycle is eventually broken, thankfully, and without spoiling anything, the climax is refreshing and terrifying, making the trip worth it all-in-all.Despite some large flaws, ""I Saw the Devil"" is one of the best revenge-thrillers in quite some time. It is an outstanding film, and is well-worth-seeing for those with a strong stomach. I give it a very good 8 out of 10.",I Saw the Devil

(R)After his fiance is brutally murdered by serial killer Min-sik, secret service agent Byung-hun goes rogue on a quest for revenge, but that is only the beginning of the unsettling, unpredictable, and insidiously sad story. Director Jee-woon brings some of the same wild shifts in tone and framing that made his ""The Good, the Bad, and the Weird"" such an outlandish entertainment to this film (like a detour into the home of a cannibal), but he mostly plays it for tense, visceral discomfort. Surprisingly (almost compellingly) watchable, despite the grisly sights in store; it's expertly crafted, structured and photographed, and Min-sik's performance leans on subtle blandness to make the skin crawl more effectively than unhinged teeth-gnashing would. At almost two-and-a-half hours, though, the relentless sadism can become tiresome, even numbing, muting the effect that the final shot would have had if it capped off a tighter and more restrained film.

48,Foutainoflife,Realistically Intense,9,19 July 2018,"I loved this movie! I know this came out in 2010 but I'm just now watching it and I can say that this was one of the most awesome thrillers I've seen. I rank it right up there with Seven. I've seen where some folks have said that OldBoy (2003) is the better than this but I think this surpasses OldBoy. One of the best things about this is how you are easily lead into feeling for these characters. That has to be established, in my opinion, if you are going to have a real thriller experience. The acting was great. The speed was great and the story kept you interested. My only drawbacks were that we didn't get to hear a bit more about our killer and a few flashbacks scenes from the couple's life would have been a great addition towards showing the viewer just how wonderful the relationship had been. You clearly feel the love this man had for his fiance but she just got so little screen time that I would've like to have seen her character with a bit more depth.Some of the negative reviews have complained about the brutality towards women and the gore of that and it makes me wonder why they chose to watch it. It's one of those things like ""if you don't like the heat, stay out of the kitchen."" I can appreciate the realism portrayed here. This stuff really happens and the hurt, anger and desire for revenge is something everyone can understand. I loved it. Can't wait to watch it again.",I Saw the Devil
49,oneguyrambling,Apparently every second South Korean is a serial killer.,7,27 December 2011,"I Saw the Devil is an extreme film. Probably not as 'extreme' as crap like The Human Centipede or A Serbian Tale, but it is doubtless a film streets ahead of both because it is all vaguely plausible.Vaguely A serial killer is operating in remote areas of South Korea. He is vile, thorough and entirely cold-blooded. Seemingly driven to degrade, humiliate and abuse his victims, he is a repugnant, disgusting machine purpose built to inflict pain and suffering.Kyung-Chul preys upon women of various ages, and once they are in his clutches he calmly explains to them what is going to happen, because once they get that far they don't get away This detestable piece of work is named Kyung-Chul, he is played by Choi Min Sik of Oldboy renown.(This is not a John Doe from Se7en revealing spoiler, we are introduced to Kyung-Chul within minutes and he is never far from the screen throughout the film.) The reason we follow him at all is that on this occasion he has chosen a victim whose death brings repercussions. To paraphrase the 'Who shot Mr Burns' episode of The Simpsons ""Dozens of people are shot every day in Springfield, until now none of them was important."" So when Special Agent Soo-Hyun (Byung-Hun Lee) and the Police search party find enough evidence to realise that his pretty, pregnant wife is the latest victim of Kyung-Chul, Soo-Hyun shelves all other plans and decides he will find this man and seek his vengeance. As if having one highly trained, extremely p*ssed relative wasn't enough, Soo-Hyun's father in law is the ex-Police Chief. He immediately green-lights Soo-Hyun's plan of retribution and Soo-Hyun takes a list of four potential suspects and gets to work.Now with time of the essence and the rage at boiling point, Soo-Hyun ignores your 'standard procedure', heading straight to torture and other brutal intimidation tactics. Not surprisingly these work pretty well, and he ploughs through the first couple of names on the list. The third is more difficult to track – it is in fact Kyung-Chul, but once located the fun really starts Soo-Hyun decides that merely killing his wife's tormentor is hardly sufficient. Upon locating Kyung-Chul he sets about providing his own systematic brand of incremental torture. He beats Kyung-Chul senseless, only to repeatedly spare him the finishing blow, at which point he releases him once again from his clutches.Kyung-Chul is understandably perturbed by this turn of events, and openly wonders just how Soo-Hyun manages to continually be one step behind him as he attempts to elude his pursuer. Worse still it seems that Soo-Hyun has no quick fix in mind, he wants to keep his intricate and prolonged revenge on his terms, and a deadly 'catch and release' game ensues.The film is exceptionally violent – definitely not for the easily squeamed – but the two leads make it work. Soo-Hyun and Kyung-Chul inflict massive punishment upon each other, with each having the upper hand at various points and with the stakes steadily rising. Choi Min Sik has made a career of playing roles on the edge of reality and he is most definitely called upon to do that here, his Kyung-Chul is a man repugnant enough for the ages, not only does he eventually realise why his assailant is haunting his every move, he relishes the challenge, and being defeated at his own game is apparently worse than his own death.Byung-Hun Lee is also believable in a role that starts out as slightly more straightforward, but delves into darker territory when it appears that Soo_Hyun is perhaps getting a little too happy with his work.Before I watched I Saw the Devil all I knew was that it was a serial killer movie and had a lot of high-end violence, which leaves endless possibilities.I Saw the Devil is indeed violent, it is indeed unnerving at times and may test your moral compass. It is not the most striking film that I have seen this year, nor anywhere near the best. That leaves it in the unenviable position of being worth watching, but not much more than that.I can recommend I Saw the Devil as a quality film, but I can't say that it will change your life or make your jaw drop like others have claimed.It is powerful at times but a little silly in others, and if you believe the events here apparently about one guy in seven in South Korea is a serial killer. That might be more disturbing to me than the rest of the events.I wonder how the remake will turn out in a couple years? Final Rating – 7 / 10. Another original piece of work from South Korea. I saw the Devil might not wow you, but it might give you something different to talk about at work next week.P.S. Don't say I didn't warn you about the violence: the Achilles scene alone made me squirm more than a dozen Saws could.",I Saw the Devil
50,Prashast_Singh,I Saw The Devil: Revenge served hot...and cold!,9,16 October 2016,"Movie: I Saw the DevilRating: 4.5/5I don't prefer watching foreign movies at all. By chance I got to know about I SAW THE DEVIL, a South Korean action thriller that had garnered praises all over. This made me excited to watch it, and I couldn't resist myself from watching it. I later came to know that there are two versions of this film: Korean and International. I watched both of them, but missed a few scenes of the Korean cut. Despite of this, having watched it in English (dubbed) and Korean (English Subtitled) both, I found it to be pretty interesting and gripping.I SAW THE DEVIL is a kind of revenge story that one would hardly have seen before at all. It's really very gripping from the moment it begins. One gets to see the bare minded madness of what one can do. Sadly, since in India we never got exposed to such films, the initial reaction was ""it's amazing but too explicit."" But as I realized the real intention behind this film, I found I hadn't exactly seen the real intention of violence, profanity etc too. It intended to show everything realistically. And that's why it engages you fully.The film has some minor flaws, perhaps not really flaws because they don't hinder the progress the film makes from the beginning. But really, a few sequences needed to be a bit shorter and a few subplots could've been avoided. But what takes over these flaws is the performance by the lead actors, Byung-hun Lee and Choi Min-Sik. These two men drive the story to an extreme and keep you interested all the time.I SAW THE DEVIL is well adapted and executed by its director Kim Jee- Woon. I don't have problem with violence, since I have been habitual of seeing such kind of violence in many action movies and being an action film lover, I couldn't resist myself from watching the fight scenes again and again. But due to the excessive obscenity in a few scenes, I recommend it's better to watch this film alone or with someone of your age group who is interested in such films, not family. It's definitely not for kids, unless they grow up of course.There are a lot more positives to list here. The film is well shot with good production values, due to which it's recommended to catch the film on Blu-ray instead of DVD. The visuals are excellent. The film is never hindered by any songs and the BGM is terrific, especially in the action and dramatic scenes. It has brilliant action, but it also has a riveting drama. Byung-hun Lee is very handsome and a brilliant actor who fits the role. Choi Min-Sik as the villain is a total firecracker. He gives a brilliant performance close to perfection. Other actors do their part well.Overall, I SAW THE DEVIL is a good action thriller that nevertheless keep you riveted despite of mild editing flaws as the overall film is very gripping. It's recommended for those who like dark action thrillers and without minding the language barrier. I know it's not 100% perfect, but then who gives 100% perfection always? For movie lovers who can see a lot more than just violence and vulgarity, this film is a must watch and definitely thought-provoking. In other words, an action packed thrilling delight!",I Saw the Devil

His pregnant wife got killed and her severed head was found in a river. He immediately finds the house of the killer by himself and finds his wife's ring the the drain. He catches him in a greenhouse while he's raping a high school girl and beats him and leaves money to him (why is that umm who knows?) with a contraption in his stomach so that he can be tracked assuming he'll be constipated the whole time. Then he catches him again in the house of two girls killed by a cannibal man and his girlfriend and the killer stays overnight. The main character shows up and becomes a real ninja again and beats the cannibal and the other and leaves him in a tunnel. He wakes up and goes to a pharmacy to be able to defecate. In the toilet he finds the device and puts it in the mouth of the man he beat in the toilet. The main ninja shows up and sees he's gone. He goes to the hospital asking where's his friend and kills him and just walks away. The killer goes after his father in law and his sister in law. He's injured and the girl was out there wrapped in sth but it's not clear if she's dead or not. The least credible part is when the killed turned himself in in the middle of a road, the ninja shows up and kidnaps him with his jeep and takes him to his house known by everyone but the rest of the police officers can't just know it.

It's an interesting concept which is mostly executed well, but I felt that it a little bit too long and the idea of developing the villain more than the protagonist didn't always sit too well with me. As the movie unfolds, there are times when you almost begin to sympathize with Min-Sik Choi's serial killer. And with the exception of the the fiancée's family, there are no likable characters.

However, those anti-hero thoughts were quickly dashed away - he's straight up evil. Always the reliable actor, Min-Sik may have out-done himself; he successfully transformed into one of cinema's most memorable serial killer/villains.

Cue a game of cat and mouse, where both ruthless agent and ruthless killer try to outwit each other.""I Saw the Devil"" is an extremely violent movie, with a plot that doesn't make much sense (it is full of holes) but that keeps going by sheer force of its inherent purpose: show to how depths hate, anger and pain can make people fall into.

56,meddlecore,Intensely Explicit & Extremely Shocking.,7,30 October 2014,"I Saw The Devil is another extremely gory, brutally violent, and sexually explicit shock-horror feature from South Korea. While not as exhaustingly ""realistic"" as The Butcher (which I reviewed earlier), it's effectively just as disturbing (probably even moreso), with a twisted undertone of (very) dark humour.It tells the story of a misogynistic, sociopathic, serial bludgeoning rapist named Kyung-Chul (portrayed, hauntingly, by Min-Sik Choi of Oldboy fame). From the very first scene this monster violently attacks, kidnaps, rapes, tortures and dismembers a number of beautiful, young girls. But he doesn't limit himself to this preference, as he's clearly ready, willing and able to kill any and everyone he comes into contact with. The very thought alone, that such people exist in this world, is enough to make you sweat.The remains of the girl who dies in the opening scene are discovered by a young boy; dismembered, and dispersed across a barren field. She turns out to be the daughter of the local Police Chief; and girlfriend of a spook named Soo-Hyun.The killer's misogyny stems from a lifetime of rejection- which drives his violent rage. He's never been good enough for any woman, and now he's lashing out on the world without remorse.When Soo-Hyun becomes privy of his girlfriend's fate he quits his job; choosing instead to walk the path of hell and seek revenge for the death of his beloved (who also happened to be pregnant with their child).To achieve this, he utilizes his security connections to identify and track the 4 major suspects in the case. After violently vetting two of them...he manages to narrow the list down to one man: Kyung-Chul.After following a few of leads, he is eventually able to track Kyung-Chul down and confront him with a timely intervention. During the brawl that ensues, Soo-Hyun succeeds in knocking the sick bastard out. But instead of killing him...he plants some sort of tracking device inside him. This device not only tracks his position; it also provides an unfettered audio feed directly to a smartphone application.Soo-Hyun now has the ability to listen in on all of Kyung-Chul's conversations, while tracking his every move. And he plans to use this power to intervene in every situation where Kyung-Chul believes he has the upper hand on an unsuspecting victim. However, it is evident that Soo-Hyun is not intervening specifically to save these women; rather to punish Kyung-Chul, by preventing him from engaging in the one activity that will satiate his hunger.By the halfway point it becomes obvious that the hunter has become the hunted. Though...for some reason this new alpha predator prefers to play with his prey...rather than swiftly put it out of it's misery...An intense, action packed ride from the beginning to end. There is an extreme amount sexual exploitation and violence going on in this film, so if you can't handle watching people be violently molested and gorily tortured...then this certainly isn't the film for you. In the end, it's about having to become a monster in order to defeat a monster. In this way, it is thematically quite similar to HBO's True Detective. The subtle strand of dark humour threaded throughout is particularly intriguing- especially considering the disturbing nature of the content matter. However, it works (much in the same way that Kim Ki-Duk's bizarre, twisted and hilarious Moebius does). At about 2 hours and 20 minutes, it's a long film. But the awesome special effects and violent saturation make it hard to turn away. If you are looking to be simultaneously shocked, disturbed and entertained...then I suggest you check this one out.7 out of 10.",I Saw the Devil
57,KnightsofNi11,Thrilling to the core,8,25 June 2011,"How far can the revenge thriller genre go? Well when you have a film of this genre helmed by twisted Korean director Jee-woon Kim it can go pretty far. I Saw the Devil is about a secret agent who blurs the line between good and evil as he hunts down his fiancée's killer to enact some particularly gruesome revenge. His lust for revenge sends him to the brink of insanity as he begins to become a more despicable human being than the serial killer he is chasing down. The film is brutal, intense, and haunting. It is unapologetically graphic from start to finish and is absolutely not for the faint of heart. But, for anyone who can stomach its brutality, I Saw the Devil is quite the movie.It seems this film's primary goal is to shock and disgust. It more than excels in this area, but it also works very well as a psychological thriller. There is this constant struggle of what is good and what is evil throughout the film. The distinction grows more and more faint as Kim Soo-hyeon grows more and more obsessed with catching and defeating Kyung-chul, the serial killer. He is disturbingly brutal and endlessly vicious in his revenge against Kyung-chul. The film has a somewhat repetitive nature once it gets going. Kyung-chul hides somewhere, is about to torture a victim, but then Soo-hyeon stops him and beats the hell out of him before leaving him in misery and pain so that he may track him down and torture him once again. But the repetitiveness works because it is a constant escalation in brutality and a loss of humanity. Plus every fight between Soo-hyeon and Kyung-chul is incredible.Jee-woon Kim shoots this film with a brutally precise eye for visual integrity. His camera-work allows the film to succeed as a haunting drama as well as a fast paced action thriller. The fights are choreographed excellently and the violence in each duel only increases. This isn't a film for the squeamish as Kim finds every possible way to disgust his audience with the bloodiest and most malicious forms of torture possible. It is all shot so intensely that you just want to scream in pain and disgust at the horrors you are witnessing. And yet at the same time there are calmer and more subtle scenes of the film which are shot with haunting beauty in the framing and camera movement. Plus the film has a disturbingly beautiful score that will leave you mystified as well as terrified. I wouldn't go as far as to call this an art house film but it certainly has some qualities that might lead it to that.I Saw the Devil is a fantastic film in all of its bloody glory. It is the kind of film that will only appeal to those with an appetite for maliciousness and a stomach for horrific amounts of blood and gore. This film is so disturbed and yet so excellent in its execution that if you can handle it you will be treated to a very worthwhile film. Expect the unexpected with this film and be prepared to look away in horrified disgust.",I Saw the Devil
58,gregsrants,Best serial killer movie since Se7en,9,15 September 2010,"Prior to my screening on I Saw the Devil at the Toronto International  Film Festival, all I knew about the film was the one sentence provided  to me by IMDb.com: A secret agent tracks a serial killer who murdered  his fiancée.  But I did know that the film was directed by Ji-woon Kim who helmed  last year's brilliant, the Good, The Bad and The Weird. And on the  strength of that resume entry alone, I secured tickets to I Saw the  Devil.  To say that I wasn't prepared for what I was about to screen was an  understatement. And I certainly wasn't prepared to comment that I Saw  the Devil is the best film about a serial killer since Se7en.  The film begins with the serial killer abducting a female victim. After  nearly destroying her head with a hammer, he dismembers her and  disposes of the various body parts.  A search ensues, and her head is found is shallow waters. We learn that  the murdered young girl was the fiancée of Kim So-Hyun who happens to  be some kind of Special Service bodyguard. She also was the daughter of  the former Chief of Police.  Kim So-Hyun abruptly takes two weeks off work and begins a manhunt for  his finances killer. He has narrowed it down to four possibilities and  after roughing up the first two (multiple wrench blows to the nuts) he  focuses on his third suspect named Kang.  We know from the opening scene that Kang is indeed the killer and when  Kim So-Hyun breaks into his home, he realizes he has found his man.  But instead of turning Kang over to justice, Kim decides that he will  beat, torture and then release Kang over and over again tormenting him  without peace. A transmitter swallowed unwillingly by Kang allows Kim  to follow his every move.  The next reels of film will follow as Kim dispels some incredibly  violent and bloody vengeance on Kang. Using everything from rocks to  plastic bags to fire extinguishers and fish hooks, Kim will enter  Kang's life, beat him near death, then leave him to his wounds only to  hunt him down and beat him some more.  The scenes of the beatings are not for the faint of heart as I Saw the  Devil is not for the squeamish. I scalpel to the foot and the cutting  of the Achilles tendon got the biggest reaction from the crowd, but  there is enough blood and torture afflicted here to give anyone  nightmares.  Ji-woon Kim brilliantly weaves a tale that has not been shown in film  before. Our two leads meet each other early in the film whereas most  serial killer films don't pit the law and the maniac on the screen  together until the final act. Kim clearly has the upper hand until a  turn of events allow Kang to again strike back. It's like two  heavyweight boxers standing in the ring going toe-to-toe in a crowd  pleasing match of heavy blows.  And just when Kang takes control again and tries to surrender to  police, Kim again finds a way to avenge his family.  Byung-hun Lee as Kim and Min-sik Choi as Kang, are brilliantly cast and  bring an energy to the screen that is maintained through the 144  minutes of the uncut edit. The supporting cast which essentially  involves further Kang victims or unsavory characters that deserve their  fates, do just enough to distract us from the brutality of the  one-on-one battle and allow us to catch our breath (barely) before the  carnage begins anew.  It's been a while since I have been so invigorated and involved in a  film such as I Saw the Devil that I wanted to climb the highest  mountain and sing its praises, but this film delivers the goods. Rarely  do you find an audience involved with that much violence on screen,  cheering and applauding when a character utters, ""I'm far from done""  during a blood soaked frenzy of activity.  I didn't just see the devil. I saw the best serial killer movie in many  years and clearly one that goes in my Top 5 serial killer films of all  time.",I Saw the Devil
59,Vivekmaru45,The Greatest Serial Killer Film Ever Made. And The Most Disturbing Film I have Ever Seen.,10,30 May 2011,"The South Koreans are RANK #1 in the serial killer genre. I have seen many serial killer films, and much to my delight this one captivated me from the start and till the disturbing ending scene.This is also one of the most beautifully directed films of its kind. Plot: Kyung-chul (Choi Min-sik) is a dangerous psychopath who kills for pleasure. He has committed infernal serial murders in diabolic ways that one cannot even imagine and his victims range from young women to even children. The police have chased him for a long time, but were unable to catch him. One day, Joo-yeon, daughter of a retired police chief becomes his prey and is found dead in a horrific state. Her fiancé Soo-hyun (Lee Byung-hun), a top secret agent, decides to track down the murderer himself. He promises himself that he will do everything in his power to take bloody vengeance against the killer, even if it means that he must become a monster himself to get this monstrous and inhumane killer.The film is directed by veteran director Kim Ji-woon, who has also directed The Quiet Family (1998) and A Tale of Two Sisters (2003). Choi Min-sik gives his best performance in the film, deserving of an Oscar. Lee Byung-hun complements him wonderfully. This film is also not suitable for younger audiences and family viewing as it features graphic and unrated violence. Verdict: BUY THIS ONE.",I Saw the Devil

Meanwhile we watch some great scenes of gore, with lots of blood but also very well shot. The humor is also present with some great jokes of black humor that are well connected to the plot. In fact is with little details this movie makes the difference, like some scenes where the camera work is great: the stabbing inside the cab is one of them.

A cat and mouse chase between a killer and a man on his path of vengeance.Although it's not the most suspenseful movie, it is one of the more brutal and uncomfortable. Lots of violence and gore, too. Because of these factors, this movie is not for those that are weak against blood, body parts, cannibalism and multiple stabbing scenes.However, these violent and uncomfortable elements showed the bad side of vengeance, and the collateral damage of taking it too far.

A few spasms of technically excellent hapkido choreography notwithstanding, ""I Saw the Devil"" is perhaps the most artistically bankrupt film I've seen in a decade; but, hey, at least it was offensive! Torture-porn, serial-killer worship and sexism at its absolute, blood-spattering worst. And it's one superbly directed, stunningly shot and amazingly acted ride that only gets more tense and gut-wrenching as it keeps falling faster and faster down the abyss.",I Saw the Devil
63,DonFishies,"An uncompromising, unsettling and unforgettable thriller",8,24 September 2010,"This movie is not for the squeamish, or the faint of heart. Censors claimed it was offensive to human dignity. These were the kinds of things they told the audience at the world premiere screening of the Uncut Version of I Saw the Devil at the Toronto International Film Festival last week. I had heard the movie was pretty graphic, but I never expected that it would push any boundaries. I turned out to be only half right. After finding out his fiancée has been brutally murdered, secret agent Dae-hoon (Byung-hun Lee) is at a loss. With the help of his father-in-law, he sets out on a revenge plot to find the man who did it. He quickly finds the culprit, Kyung-chul (Min-sik Choi). He beats him pretty badly, but instead of killing him, he leaves him alive. He wants to stalk his prey, and exact his revenge slowly and increasingly more painfully.Going in with very few ideas of what I was about to see, I was startled and thrilled at the tenacious audacity on display from the opening scene all the way until the final frames. The film is a gritty, merciless experience that could never be truly recreated in North America. This is the kind of hard-boiled revenge thriller you could only find in Korea. And to hear that even the censors there could not handle Kim Ji-woon's complete vision makes the film all the more uncompromising and astounding. It has taken me well over a week to try and come up with the words to describe and review the film, but never once have I forgotten anything I saw. It is quite simply, unforgettable.I was right in assuming the film would not push the boundaries of what can be shown in regards to graphic violence and gore. But it comes really close. It makes Park Chan-Wook's entire Vengeance Trilogy look about as violent as the Toy Story Trilogy. Blood sprays, flies, drips, gushes – every verb or way blood can possibly flow out of the human body occurs over the course of the film. It relishes in it no matter if the shot is raw, unflinching and real, or hyper stylized and completely over-the-top. One sequence involving a brutal double murder as the camera swoops around the scene in a circle is simply magnificent to watch, both to see how much blood is spilt and for how wicked and incredible a shot it is.The revenge tale at the core of I Saw the Devil is not all too original, but it is the story and idea around it that is. Very rarely do we see a film with two characters that start off completely different, but very slowly become all in the same. Dae-hoon and Kyung-chul are both very stubborn individuals, who will not back down from each other. They just keep at each other, and even as Kyung-chul is continually beaten, abused and victimized, he never once lets up. I keep coming back to a comparison with Batman and The Joker in The Dark Knight, and how those two menaces push each other to their physical limits, and that is exactly what happens in this film. While it was easy to pick sides in Dark Knight, Ji-woon makes it increasingly difficult for the audience to figure out who they should sympathize with here. It is a haunting and blatantly moral-defying story, and its raw and emotional undertones are more than difficult to swallow.But the key problem I found with the film is Ji-woon's lack of ability to know when to cut. There are easily twenty minutes that could be chopped right out of the film, and none of its edge would be lost in the process. I was glued to the screen for the majority of the film, but found myself checking my watch more than once because I was totally baffled as to why it runs over 140 minutes. There is only so much revenge one can take and comprehend, and having the film run so long makes it all too easy to call out as being self-indulgent. I respect the film, and I respect Ji-woon as a filmmaker (I wanted to seek out the rest of his film catalogue immediately after the lights came up), but it just makes such an incredible movie feel a bit sloppy and weakened as a cohesive package.Another inconsistent element is Lee's Dan-hoon. We never learn much about him outside of his being a secret agent and wanting to inflict as much pain as he can through his revenge scheme. So how are we to assume he was not a sick and twisted individual in the first place? How are we to know this is not his first time inflicting such a painful revenge? He rarely speaks, and his cold, calculating eyes never once give us a hint of any further development. It is a great performance by Lee, but it is one that feels very underdeveloped – outside of some rather obvious sequences.But then, anyone would look underdeveloped when standing next to Choi. The man gives a performance that is the stuff of legend. He was incredible as the lead in Oldboy as the man who was wronged, and is even better as the wrongdoer here. He brings out the monster in Kyung-chul all too easily, and his riveting performance is unmissable. The transformation into this disgusting, psychopathic creature is nothing short of amazing. He chews up scenery at every turn, and is magnetic on screen. Nothing even comes close to equaling the power, intensity and dare I say authenticity he puts into this character. He is the stuff of nightmares.I Saw the Devil is a great revenge thriller, but is far from perfect. Choi's electric performance alone should become required viewing for anyone with any interest in film.8/10.(An edited version of this review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",I Saw the Devil
64,mahmus,Brutal,9,14 October 2020,"I Saw the Devil is one of the most upsetting, violent and graphic movies I've ever seen. It's like Prisoners meets Martyrs. Times a thousand.It's insanely brutal, and not in a fun way; Not even close. My heart stopped in more than one ocassion. It's also beautifully shot, but seriously, this movie is messed up. Like, really messed up. And I love it.It's right up there with Oldboy as one of the craziest revenge thrillers ever made.Also, Choi Min-sik beats someone with a hammer and the Oldboy fanboy inside me just couldn't contain himself.",I Saw the Devil
65,LoneWolfAndCub,By far one of the best movies I've seen in many years,10,14 September 2012,"Personally I believe South Korea have been making the best films over the past few years. The movies they make take simple stories and create wholly original pieces driven by well-written characters, fantastic scores and directors with more talent than the majority of America's combined. I Saw the Devil just proves my theory without a shred of doubt. What sounds like a typical revenge thriller is just so much more and by the end of this movie I had to pick my jaw up off the floor. What I thought would be a good way to kill a couple of hours ended up making me laugh, cringe and ultimately move me.Jee-woon Kim, who has previously directed A Tale of Two Sisters, A Bittersweet Life and The Good, The Bad, The Weird, all excellent movies that would have been hard to top has done just that. With a simple story involving a federal agent (Byung-hun Lee) hunting down a serial killer (Min-sik Choi) for murdering his fiancée one would think it would be standard revenge-action fodder. But the two leads, who are two of the greatest actors at the moment, pull out amazing performances. Byung-hun Lee who is probably one of the best actors I've seen grace the screen in a long time is just so good it's hard to believe as he goes from a seemingly good guy to a completely tortured soul. Min-sik Choi plays the roll of serial killer almost too well, creating a cinematic villain to rival that of Hannibal Lector or Norman Bates.Watching these two clash is fantastic, but that's not it. There are few scenes in this film that are just mind-blowing and one that comes to mind (and is always mentioned in a review) is the scene in the taxi cab when three criminals face-off as the camera does a 360 degree spin for a good 30 seconds. Another is a face-off between Byung and three other crazy psychopaths in a secluded retreat home to a cannibal couple. THe other thing I need to mention is the fantastic score, in particular the final piece over the credits which is so moving I shed a tear.At 141 minutes long it seems like it may be overly long but the time just flies by. The film balances character-based scenes and drama with glorious action set-pieces and unflinchingly graphic violence not for those with a faint heart. Heads roll, jaws rip, flesh is consumed and bones break...no part of the human body is safe in this movie.I can't say enough about this, just go see the damn movie, you will not regret it. An easy 5/5",I Saw the Devil
66,asda-man,I saw a masterpiece,10,4 February 2012,"I was preparing myself for the worst with ""I Saw The Devil"" after hearing all the massive hype surrounding the film, I tried to focus more on the rare negative review, just so that I wouldn't be disappointed. I was expecting a slow serial killer revenge film, but I only actually got part of that. Korea is easily one of my favourite countries for producing horror/thrillers that are absolutely stunning, ""Oldboy"", ""The Chaser"", ""Lady Vengeance"", ""Thrist"" and now this. ""I Saw The Devil"". Which probably blows all them out the water, as being not just one of the finest Korean horror films I've ever seen, but simply one of the best horror films I have ever seen. ""I Saw The Devil"" wasn't slow at all! At 2hrs 20mins I was left wanting even more from it as it delivers a fast-moving, action-packed and emotionally charged revenge thriller, which I just found utterly absorbing.""I Saw The Devil"" doesn't contain the most original story. We've all heard of a man who murders another man's loved one and then he goes on a usually bloody revenge. We've seen it done before, but ""I Saw The Devil"" puts on what seems to be a fresh take. It goes back to the basics and which is probably why it's so stunning. It doesn't get too over complex like ""Lady Vengeance"" it goes to its serial killing roots and delivers a straight tale of revenge. The film focuses on two memorable characters. The first one being our very own ""Oldboy"" who plays someone very different (well strictly speaking that isn't true because he played an extremely similar character in ""Sympathy For Lady Venegence"".) He plays a complete monster who is obsessed with killing, he doesn't care who he's killing or raping, if he wants it, he has it. Someone said that he's a really bad character because he's not fleshed out, he's just a caricature killing machine, but I think that's actually done to serve a purpose here like, The Bride in ""Kill Bill Vol.1"" The director doesn't allow us to feel any compassion what so ever about him, so we're completely on the detective's side. I was left wanting revenge, and he didn't even kill any one I know of! And let's not forget here, that he is the devil! He wouldn't be the devil if he had a sympathetic background story.The other character is the detective (sorry for labelling the ""Killer"" and ""detective"" I'm just not very good with weird Korean names) who is an extremely level-headed and cool, likable character who simply wants revenge, but ends up doing it in the wrong way. It's his actions that really carry the film along, as he makes one decision after the other, thinking that he's doing the right thing when actually he's making things a whole lot worse. It's very thought-provoking and a lot of care and attention has obviously gone into the screenplay. The characters are thought about in the right way. The execution is also every horror lovers dream! When you want something to happen, it does and so there is no viewer frustration! The film races along perfectly with no glitches at all.The directing is also mind-blowing. There are some scenes that just look sensational, such as the 360 degree taxi scene and the electrifying first encounter in the green-house and the suspenseful overload in the manor house. It just looks amazing and sometimes my jaw actually fell onto the floor! The fight scenes are some of the best directed scenes I've ever seen. And fight scenes are very hard to get right. It sometimes feels like Quentin Tarantino is behind the camera (you can look at that in which ever way you like.) There's also fantastic use of setting and cinematography with the beautiful snow falling and then the hideously bloody outcome. The directing also makes sure that you're gripped every step of the way. It's more like an experience, where we're going on a journey with the detective, which is why we feel so emotionally invested in his character.""I Saw The Devil"" isn't afraid of turning up the gore meter either. Like most Korean horror, it doesn't shy away, yet it doesn't sink into torture-porn territory. The sometimes unholy amount of blood always serves a purpose and a meaning. It's intense. By the end of it, there's also a great moral to the story in their as well. Revenge isn't always the answer which is a theme explored brilliantly in ""7 Days"" as well. It left me speechless. ""I Saw The Devil"" is one of the best horror revenge films I have ever seen, and it should leave all horror fans drooling. It's perfectly executed with some idiotically amazing directing. Combine this with fabulous music, superb acting, an absorbing script and awe-inspiring cinematography and you have one of the greatest horror films ever made. I saw the devil, and he wasn't pretty.",I Saw the Devil
67,doctorsmoothlove,Watch the Devil,6,9 June 2011,"Kim Ji-woon is a good director, fluent in film history and how to adapt it to his own literary vision, which has given us many interesting movies over the years. His A Tale of Two Sisters was one of the most effective genre horror films of the last decade, so even his mediocre new film I Saw the Devil is more meaningful than just about any contemporary thriller. I can't pinpoint if its shortcomings are lamentable self-indulgence or unfortunate exuberance, yet either results in tedium and de-sensitizing (more on this later). Still, it's too well conceived to be shunned by the mentally mature.What mainstream media has indicated about the film's violence, bloodshed, and depravity should not be understated. It's a visceral experience that is acted out as seriously as it should be. Still, many viewers and critics have made the mistake of assuming the film actively glorifies its grisly subjects, which isn't true. The violence is instead utilized for storytelling purposes and is necessary for the narrative. The antagonist Kyung-chul is a psychopath whose targets are young, attractive women. His motivations are primarily sexual, and he prefers to quickly finish his victims. He enjoys his victims' agony and quizzically ignores their pleas for mercy. Their humane logic is incapable of moving him. As the movie starts, he abducts a woman stranded by the side of the road and does his business with her. Her dismembered body is located the next day, and her fiancé Soo-hyun vows revenge. Soo-hyun works as an agent in the Korean equivalent of the FBI and discovers the suspects in the case. The discovery process doesn't take long, though there is some humor in his ""interrogation"" of incorrect suspects. Soo-hyun finds Kyung-chul, disrupts another murder, and beats him badly before forcibly inserting a tracking device down his throat. He makes sure not to kill him. What follows from this first segment is a cat-and-mouse chase where Soo-hyun stalks his victim and continues to pester him. After many losses, Kyung-chul retreats to his genre-nodding cannibal friends' house and gets some helpful advice: he and his pursuer are the same. If he wants to win this conflict, he must not let Soo-hyun kill him, and the only way to guarantee that is by surrendering to police.I Saw the Devil is reminiscent of Stephen Spielberg's Duel (1971), albeit removed of a strong Hitchcock influence. The outcome of either is generally known, and the filmmakers have to find some other way of making it interesting. Spielberg's version is appropriately light on story and should be inferior to Ji-woon's movie. I Saw the Devil is less organic filmmaking with only the viewer's possibly incorrect interpretations of its plot to compensate its shortcomings. Unlike Duel, this film's protagonist is hardly pitiable. He spares no effort in assaulting his prey, violating his governmental role, hurting others and himself, and even helping Kyung-chul evade capture. He still doesn't kill him, leaving him in a scaffold until passersby activate a guillotine. Soo-hyun, as the title suggests, ""sees the devil"" while simultaneously assuming that role. The film could work both as a sly critique of masculine violence or a subversion of Duel and its ilk even if it isn't shot as well. There is some certainty within the moral ambiguity. The plot is a series of repetitive short films that induces the same perversion in the audience that it reveals of its characters. There is some black humor within the cannibal hillbilly segment, but sadism should never be this boring.Recommended",I Saw the Devil
68,shark-43,Brutal & Brilliant,9,14 August 2011,"I SAW THE DEVIL is a brutal, bloody, shocking and very effective crime drama. A psychopath has killed many young girls and when one of them turns out to be the pregnant fiancé of a government agent - the agent takes matter into his own hands to track down the killer and make him pay. Now in many American movies, the hero would spend the whole movie tracking the guy down then finally have him cornered on the roof of a skyscraper or the edge of waterfall, etc and then he'd say a corny quip and blow the guy away. But in this amazing Korean film, the agent finds the killer early on and injures him badly and then says ""this is just the beginning"" - planting in this killer's mind the fear that he will come back for him - he doesn't know how or when. The psychological aspect of the hunter and the hunted is very powerful and the performances are incredible. One of the best actors of the planet (Min-sik Choi) who was so brilliant as the lead in OLD BOY, is once again, fantastic as the twisted killer. This movie might not be for everyone - the camera never flinches from any brutality and violence.

73,MattBrady099,Brilliant crime drama,9,17 June 2015,"Detective Oh: ""He can't become a monster to fight the monster"".The story is about a pregnant fiancé is viciously murdered by a serial killer, a detective plots an elaborate and intricate revenge plot for the man responsible. The one thing that always bugs me when I watch some movies is some the over the top violence's. It happens in most Hollywood horror movies were they try to show how brutal and dark they can get, put it just comes off torture porn. I think it's best for movies to have a reason for the use of gore and not make it mindless. The Human Centipede movies are a perfect example of what not to do with mixing gore and story. Until I sawed the 2010 film I Saw the Devil in which it has it's gory parts but it never felt like it's over doing it, and that's what I wanted for dark movies like this.The director of the movie Ji-woon Kim who directed such movies like: The Good, The Bad and the Weird and The Last Stand. I only seen two of he's films and that's this movie and The Last Stand, but I haven't seen The Good, The Bad and the Weird yet. But anywhere Ji- woon Kim directed this movie with that sense of cold revenge which set up the tone perfectly for a film like this. Every shot in this movie is shot excellently and it's sometimes beauty and sometimes ugly, I mean this movie dose have a serial killer killing dozen of people and of course it's going to be ugly unless your Hannibal the TV show that you can make that ugliness into art, but it can be beauty with the open shot view of Korean even if it takes place in a environment of snow falling which is beauty to see or just outside. Ji-woon Kim directed the action scenes really well and smoothly and I got to say it's much better than most action movies are filmed today and I always love fight scenes from Korean or different kind of countries, because they fight scenes are quick, well performed, it get's you glued to the screen because it's that good and it's just awesome, and Ji-woon Kim did a excellent job directing at matching the tone and the action scene together perfectly.Byung-hun Lee who I have seen before but not in such good movies like: The G.I Joe movies and Red 2. But in this movie I actually sawed him delivered a solid and heart breaking performance that Byung-hun Lee really humanist he's character that I can feel he's pain and fury against this killer who ruined his life. But without spoiling anything Byung-hun Lee crying at the end was hard not to laugh I mean he looked like he was smile or something, if you seen the movie then you know what I mean. Everything else was good but that cry at the end which made me laugh a little. Besides that Byung-hun Lee gave a strong performance that even I forget that cry at the end.Choi Min Sik the main serial killer of the movie delivered both treating and a uncomfortable performance that at times made me think that he wasn't acting at all he was that good. He played the devil like serial killer so well that I can picture him in real life doing all these crimes. Choi Min Sik did a excellent performance in the movie that's chilling and unforgettable.Now this movie does have a strong hold of blood and little bit of gore that some viewers may be turned off by. This movie isn't for everyone and I understand it may not be they type of movie to watch. I would only recommend this movie to people who love a dark gritty revenge film.Now for the problems: What really took me out of the movie is how many times the serial killer get's smashed in the head by a metal object or by anything that can knock your teeth out or kill you. I'm not kidding you this guy is evil but still human and some many times he get's tortured a little bit and get's brutally injured in the head which starts bleeding, but somehow he's okay after that. I know it's a small little problem but to me it's big enough for me to talk about it.Overall I Saw the Devil is a gritty crime drama that it's sometimes hard to watch and hard to take in with the level of grittiness that's in the movie, and that's what made this movie both great and brilliant.",I Saw the Devil
74,JakeBrinkman,"Amazing concept, solid acting, and an unnecessarily unrealistic plot",5,1 March 2020,"The concept is a unique twist on the crime genre with amazing, exhilarating, and sickening takes on revenge. Unfortunately the concept is where the good ideas stop. I usually appreciate realistic gore, not because I'm a gore fan, but because it opens my eyes to see how horrific the events truly are. However, this movie has plenty of gore just for the sake of gore, which completely breaks immersion. How realistic is it for a dozen serial killers to be active in the area, and what are the odds that they all know each other or all happen to meet each other in a handful of days? The movie's believability could be greatly improved by completely removing the taxi scene and rewriting the dinner scene to be with a normal family. Finally, this movie had room for many powerful emotional scenes, but it somehow kept the emotion as a subtext rather than a primary focus.Even as a subtext, the emotional acting does help carry the film. Choi (the killer Kyung Chul) acts exceptionally well throughout the entire film. Lee (the rogue cop Soo Hyeon) has a powerful opening act and closing scene, though he's far too stoic and reserved throughout the 2nd and 3rd acts.",I Saw the Devil
75,gab-67599,Intense Thriller!,10,26 September 2021,"I truly loved this story and the fact that I have not seen it done by any other director. I also got frustrated because you just want the bad guy to pay at some point and it feels like it drags on. But there was never a dull moment in this movie, don't get me wrong. This movie had a bit of every emotion tied to it, except happiness. Gory and at times a hard watch, this movie will be in my thoughts long after.

76,avik-basu1889,Does monstrosity beget monstrosity?,8,24 September 2016,"""He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster . . . when you gaze long into the abyss the abyss also gazes into you""I think the above Nietzsche quote summarises the themes revolving around Kim Jee-woon's 'I Saw the Devil' in the most compact and succinct manner possible. The story itself is nothing new and maybe perceived by some people to be a bit thin. But 'I Saw the Devil' offers a classic example of a director elevating a thin-ish script and making an exceptional film out of it. In a basic sense, this is a classic revenge tale. The male protagonist's fiancé gets killed by a serial killer, so he embarks on a journey that ideally will have revenge as its destination. But that's just the cursory summary. The film is as dark as it gets, because somewhere along the way Kim Soo- hyeon, the protagonist's conception of what amounts to proper revenge shifts from just killing the serial killer to finding pleasure in torturing him. The theme that the film explores is that maybe evil and darkness under proper circumstances has the ability to engulf innocent people. When someone faces the worst forms of tragedy and is staring at evil in its most despicable form, he/she can easily fall apart and the person's thirst for revenge can make a monster out of him/her. The film portrays this shift, this journey into darkness in the most ultra-violent fashion possible. There are moments which will make the viewer squirm and cringe with disgust. Now when a director makes a decision to go hell for leather with the violence, it can very easily go wrong and the violence can become gratuitous like the violence portrayed in the so-called 'torture porn' films. However the violence in 'I Saw the Devil', no matter how brutal and graphic, serves a purpose. I think the violence needed to be strong, graphic and uninhibited to portray a genuine descent into evil. The filmmaking and camera-work in the non-violent scenes is pretty stellar too. Jee-woon has the uncanny ability to make even the most horrifying images like a decapitated head in the water slowly turning around to reveal the face, look like a work of art. There is a scene involving a taxi where Jee-woon uses frantic 360 degree shots and those shots are just unbelievably executed. There are two distinct scenes where Jee-woon uses the frame within a frame shot (inspired by Mizoguchi and Renoir) in juxtaposition to each other, one involving Kyung-chul and the other involving Soo-hyeon. Both these shots look brilliant and work thematically too. The lighting in the film has to to be admired a lot as well.If there is a criticism that I can lodge against the film, it will probably be a slight lack of character density. I understand what the filmmaker is going for here and maybe in the context of the theme, a little mystery about the character of Kyung- chul is justified, but I personally would have preferred a bit more insight into Kyung-chul's origins and his own reasons and motivations for becoming a serial killer and his reasons for descent into evil would have complemented Soo-hyeon's descent. There are subtle hints here and there that maybe Kyung-chul feeds off any sense of rejection and judgement in the eyes of his potential victims which makes his violent side take over. The acting is stellar. Of course special mention has to be given to Choi Min-sik. He shows range, presence and uses his eyes brilliantly to create this despicable and evil character of Kyung-chul. Lee Byung- hun also gives a good performance as the revenge hungry Soo- hyeon.Yes, 'I Saw the Devil' lacks a bit of character density, but it is still a very engaging exploration of a character's transformation triggered by an experience of great personal tragedy. The film's moral ambiguity I think actually is intended to put the viewer in the hot-seat. I think every person who watches the film will have conflicting thoughts from a moralistic standpoint. On one hand, yes maybe a serial killer who loves to torture and kill women deserves to be punished. But at what point does this vengeful urge to punish this man go beyond the limits of acceptability? And even if the execution of the revenge is successful, is it worth losing your humanity in the process? These are the questions that 'I Saw the Devil' asks and it does so really well.",I Saw the Devil
77,Li_85,Makes Hannibal look like bambi...Best Villain in movie history,10,25 September 2012,"Quite Simply one of the Best Horror films I've ever seen..and I've seen 1000s.I have seen many violent films and have a massive collection of Hollywood and Hong Kong films. Untold Story and Dr Lamb are classic serial killer films that shocked me. I cam across i Saw the devil which stars the legend himself Oldboy. Wow Wow Wow, I was shocked and disturbed by the extreme violence but at the same time the film was gritting yet entertaining and kept me glued all the way. Superbly directed and Brilliant performances by the hero and villain. The Villain (Oldboy) was Amazing, what a performance. If this was Hollywood, he would of been on the top 10 all time villains list. Also the other supporting role serial killer cannibal was good to. Some people may hate this film for its brutal violence and rape, but the sad truth is, there have been and are serial killers and this movie shows the horrible experience the victims go through. I can understand people may not like a vigilante but its only a movie so chill out. Highly recommended. This movie definitely makes it to my list of favourite films of all time.",I Saw the Devil
78,Rockwell_Cronenberg,Relentless.,7,8 May 2011,"I'll start off by saying that after everything I had read about the film, I was expecting it to actually be even more brutal. I mean, don't get me wrong, the violence here is absolutely relentless and easily some of the most intense I've ever seen, but I was expecting more. There was never a moment where I considered turning away from the screen (although, poop is gross), which I was expecting to have plenty of. It didn't have an impact on my appreciation of the whole piece though. Like I said, the violence was still relentless and some of the best I've seen from recent years. Relentless really is the perfect word for the whole thing; once it gets going about twenty minutes in, it just never stops. Neither character is allowed to pause and take a breath, it's just this nonstop battle that escalates and escalates. Every scene has an intensity that few directors are able to achieve. You know this battle will continue going, but you never know what's going to happen in each scene and that's rare.There's so much violence right off the bat that it enters into this realm where anything is possible and thus every scene keeps you on the edge of your seat. The violence is probably the most positive aspect of the film, but it also contains that theme of ""when does one stop being the avenger and becomes just another monster hunting a monster?"" which is one of my favorite themes in any medium. There's something so compelling about that to me, this exploration of right and wrong and when does the just cross the line and become just another animal. Monsters turning righteous men into monsters. It's a theme that will never get old to me and this film captures that all expertly. Of course it really helps that both Byung-hun Lee and Min-sik Choi deliver sensational performances, the former being the perfect choice for the man decaying into darkness (his breakdown at the end was devastating) and the latter just being the most disgusting, detestable, terrifying monster imaginable.Throughout the film I really felt that there should have been more of an emotional strength to it, a resonance that comes with losing a loved one, but our main character boils all of that inside and when he finally lets it all out, that emotional strength comes pouring out in one riveting moment. That final scene between the two of them, where Kim Soo-hyeon realizes that no matter what he does, he can't take that boulder he spoke of off his chest and put it onto Kyung-chul's, delivers more of a punch than any scene of violence could have achieved. My one and only complaint is that the film goes on a little too long, but even that hardly makes a dent in a final product that is so compelling. I've always had a bit of a stigma against Asian cinema because, for whatever reason, it's never been able to really engage me, but this one had me hooked from about five minutes in.",I Saw the Devil
79,MovieGuy01,Movie Review: 'I Saw The Devil',9,22 May 2011,"I watched this film last week on DVD and i found it to be a excellent film. the violence was really brutal at times and i had to look away on several occasions, which is very rare for me!. Apart from that it was an absolutely fantastic movie. It is about a secret agent who finds out that his fiancée has been brutally murdered. He begins to set out on revenge to find the man who has done this to his fiancée. Soon after he finds the man who is the culprit he beats him as hard as possible. Instead of killing him he slowly tortures him alive and wants to make it as painful as possible for him. The amount of graphic violence and gore in the movie was incredible, I think some of the violence was some strongest that i have actually seen in a very long time on film. It was quite a long film to watch as it ran about 140 minutes in total. But the story was so gripping it did not feel that long at all. I was gripped to the screen throughout the entire movie where it was so good. I would really recommend this film to anyone who is able to stand watching this level of violence on screen. I absolutely loved it so much and cannot wait to see it again sometime!: My Rating 9/10",I Saw the Devil
80,flicklover,Brutal revenge film,10,30 November 2018,"I had seen very positive reviews about this film but I had seen that it was very violent. It is indeed one of the most violent films I have ever seen, but is so expertly made and acted that it all works.The film begins on a very disturbing note. A young woman on the side of a road in South Korea that is having car trouble is approached by a man that offers help. She refuses, but he comes back brutally beats her. The killer takes her to a secluded place and kills her. When the police find her remains in a river her boyfriend Kim Soo who is a secret agent is so disturbed by this loss that he vows to find the killer and get revenge. The basic premise of this film has been done many times before, but rarely as effective as this film. The film is very much a cat and mouse set up in that Kim Soo doesn't want to just kill the man who took away his love, but make him suffer. He brutalizes the killer, but let's him live, only to go after him again and again to cause as much pain as possible.This film is very intense and disturbing. The violence shown is very explicit. The difference here is that it also shows the negative effects of Kim Soo's actions. He is told that nothing that he could do can bring his fiance back, but he continues to go after his prey. Director Kim Joe Woon keeps the tension at fever pitch but doesn't ignore the human element in the story. The film gives as much time to Kyung Chul, the killer as to Kim Soo, so we get to see his point of view. He's a twisted, evil man who hates and get pleasure out of killing women. It is a long film but it's so involving that the running time is not an issue. The film asks: Is Kim Soo the same as Janh Kyung? It is an unrelentingly violent and ugly film. But it has a true sense sorrow and loss that set apart from other films of it's kind. A great film if you have the stomach.Grade: A",I Saw the Devil
81,Rendanlovell,If Taken and Saw had a baby it would be this movie.,8,6 May 2016,"If 'Saw' and 'Taken' had a love baby it would be 'I Saw The Devil'. The story is, a serial killer takes and murders a young girl but he didn't account for her future husband. Special agent Hyeon. Shortly after learning of his fiancés brutal murder he goes on a rampage looking for her killer. What Was interesting about this film was it doesn't play like the cat and mouse thriller you'd expect. When I first started watching it I almost turned it off thinking it was going to be like any old thriller. Then, within the first hour of this two plus hour film, special agent boy finds the killer and leaves him alive after shattering his wrist. This is when I really realized what I was in for. No, this is not like any other cat and mouse thriller out there. Instead of using this genres tired formula 'I Saw The Devil' creates its own. Instead of constantly on the hunt for this murderer our main character is always a step ahead of him. He follows him and lays in wait for him to go for his next victim then Mr. Special agent swoops in and beats the crap out of him.By doing this the film creates an incredibly interesting and accurate take on what evil can be. It shows us a heartless killer murder innocent people then it shows us a man avenging his bride to be. But when does it start to become inhumane? This is what really drove the two and a half hour long film. Even if you do have the stomach for this film it will still be a brutal watch. This is because the film never glorifies what it's main characters are doing. It knows that what it's showing is repulsive and doesn't hold anything back. It understands that the only way to give these characters the depth they need is to show exactly what they are doing. And this makes everything feel more gritty and realistic.It gives the story and characters added depth. Even with its mature content the film feels almost intimate. You understand why Hyeon is doing what he is doing. If you had your pregnant fiancé taking away like that it would be difficult to not at least think of doing this to the killer.There are a lot of other positives here like the production design and cinematography but the last one I'll talk about is the performances. Which are fantastic. Especially Min-Sik Choi who plays our sociopath killer. Everyone does a great job but he is no doubt the stand out. His performance feels about as honest as it could playing a character like this. He is scary, insane, and intimating all at once.That being said there are a couple of hiccups here and there. There are some kinda dumb things like the fact that Choi has his murder dungeon connected directly to his house. Another is unfortunately the length. A lot of films can still be great despite being this long but this film just drags sometimes. It's crazy saying this with all the brutal imagery but there are a couple scenes that just slow the film way down.However this is a great film. It's brutal, uncompromising, and well rounded. It puts an interesting spin on cat and mouse thrillers by making a compelling statement. Saying that, sometimes there can't be any good guys. And where do we draw the line between treating someone inhumanely? 'I Saw The Devil' is definitely worth the watch if you can stomach this level of violence.",I Saw the Devil
82,christian94,Jee-Woon Kim's Revenge and Seung-ah Yoon's missing scenes,8,18 May 2015,"Hoon-jung Park (who will later write and direct the excellent New World) writes this dark screenplay of descent into madness. Jee-Woon Kim takes on the directing challenge to honour this psychological and physical revenge genre and show his different vision than Chan-wook Park's acclaimed Revenge Trilogy.The revenge elements are there, but the audience is not necessarily cheering for the victim. Min-sik Choi who played the protagonist in Oldboy (2003) now plays the arch-villain to perfection and the screenplay allows for nuance and question on the blind quest for revenge.The scenes are atmospheric and the thriller elements are spot on. The mind of the murderer and menace are masterfully explored. Kim understands and reinvents the genre like he had with his previous film The Good, the Bad, the Weird (2008) for the Western bygone era. A Tale of Two Sisters was his successful take on horror. Kim also has shown equal mastery in some of his shorts like Coming Out (2000) where he explored vampire mythology in a modern way and later in ""Heaven's Creation"" section of Doomsday Book (2012) where he nails science-fiction and philosophy in one take.The movie is 140+ minutes but does not feel long at all. The pacing and editing are adequate. However, due to censorship, some scenes were cut out (even in the uncut version) or altered and both the Korean and International versions are missing some elements. In the international version, the deleted scenes in the cannibal's house are really what would have made a difference. The cannibal's girlfriend played by model/actress Seung-ah Yoon who does not talk in the film has some good dialog to dig into her character even if slightly. Her character without those deleted scenes remain unfortunately unidimensional otherwise. However, the scene that should have been kept at all cost is the exquisitely shot hot adulterous sex scene she has while her cannibal boyfriend is preparing the meat. The scene is one of the best sex scenes ever captured on film and is crucial to the story and characters and was unfortunately not included in the international version.So bottom line is that Jee-Woon Kim is still one of Korea's best director. I only hope that amazing scenes are never again left on the editing floor unused.",I Saw the Devil

84,akash_sebastian,One of the Greatest Stories on Revenge ever told!,8,7 September 2012,"An utterly-gripping and gut-wrenchingly violent suspense thriller. The movie is consistently uncompromising and merciless. Here, Revenge is not just 'eye for an eye' or just end the life of the person who caused the pain. It is of going to the depth of torturing the person and not letting him die, making him endure the pain again and again, until he has suffered enough. There's no good guy in this movie. To hunt and kill a monster, one has to become a monster himself. The movie takes your mind to a lot of dark places; shows the madness which every human being is capable of.Kim Ji-woon (from 'A Tale of Two Sisters') spectacularly directs another Korean Masterpiece. The screenplay is tight and gripping, and the action sequences are well-executed and well-shot. Choi Min-sik (from 'Oldboy') gives another power-packed performance as the ruthless and inhumane Serial-killer Kyun-chul. And the other lead, Lee Bung-hun (from 'The Good, The Bad and The Weird'), is terrific in the role of the widowed Secret-agent, Soo-hyun, seeking revenge. Their bloody action-packed interactions are a real treat to watch.The cinematography and background score are brilliant, as are in most good Korean thrillers.Note: People with a weak stomach for blood and gore, or who are new to the genre of Korean revenge thrillers, should abstain from watching this movie.

87,noahgibbobaker,Held down by one aspect.,7,8 October 2020,"I saw the devil was brilliant for the most part. But one huge issue ruined some extremely important moments for me.There was so much to appreciate here. The acting was amazing from everyone involved. The music was great, it often changed pitch and instrument's without feeling jarring which is incredibly impressive. The brutal violence feels so real and is absolutely justified, I don't like when something is explicit just for the sake of it. Violence is an integral part of the story and characters though so I loved it. People often survive a lot of blows to the head from blunt objects but it's not the biggest problem.My favourite thing about I saw the devil is the realism, it's not a very realistic story, well I could happen but realistically it's not a realistic story. What made this movie so scary and disturbing was how real it felt during some truly horrible moments. Speaking on a story that is believable this was heavily inspired by no country for old men, and it wears this on its sleeve. It even goes so far to have subtle details involving shoes, just like in no country for old men. I saw the devil isn't as good as the Coen brothers film but I would never expect it to be.So, the issue I think made certain scenes borderline unwatchable, the way some of the fight scenes were executed. Don't get me wrong there were some great action scenes, the one in the car is just fantastic and the buildup to it is extraordinary, but others were not good. The way the fight in the greenhouse and the fight at the doctors were filmed and edited was atrocious. It was so choppy and poorly shot, I couldn't figure out what was happening until the end of both of these sequences. The build up to these fights is so tense, but as soon as the fight broke out I lost interest until the fight was over.This might just be a me thing but it really made my experience much worse. I would still recommend I saw the devil it is mostly genuinely fantastic so if you like violent revenge stories absolutely watch it.",I Saw the Devil

90,nesfilmreviews,Heads will roll.,7,4 April 2013,"Most serial killer thrillers would end with the cop catching the bad guy but that part comes just when ""I Saw the Devil"" is getting warmed up.""I Saw the Devil,""is skillfully constructed by director Jee-woon Kim and is the one of the most artistically, yet gruesome South Korean vengeance flicks to date. It's inventive and darkly funny — you'll enjoy it with a nervous chuckle. However, the main criticism of ""I Saw the Devil"" is that it doesn't know when to quit while leading the viewer into a much darker realm for two and a half hours.Ju-Yeon (San-ha Oh), the daughter of a retired police chief is brutally murdered by the serial killer Kyung-chul (Min-sik Choi), spurring her fiancé Soo-hyun (Byung-hun Lee), a secret agent, to seek revenge. But, he doesn't just seek revenge, he indulges in a violent and bloody game of catch and release with Kyung-chul, each time making him live through the torturous pain he caused Ju-yeon to endure. It's a voyage that puts him on the edge of evil, just like the man he's been hunting.Pushing the concept of revenge to its most extreme limits, Jee-woon Kim transcends the police procedural/serial killer genre in exhilarating fashion. Unfortunately however, the approach taken eventually compromises plausibility and it goes on far too long. Allowing Kyung-chul to escape time and time again becomes repetitive by the third act, and the narrative grows tiresome. Kyung-chul continues to roam while being chased for the duration of the film, and allowed to add onto his already prolific body count simply to even a score. It unquestionably makes for gruesome entertainment, and fans of South Korea's infamous revenge genre will be more than pleased. For anyone else who might be interested, come prepared to clean up the blood splatter.",I Saw the Devil

I'm not talking about most of the beating, gore, torture and whatsoever, because that I can endure, but to watch that one perverted Kyung-chul living and doing what he does was sickening to me (props to actor Min-sik Choi for his performance). And that's the whole plot! That's why the movie focus so much on Kyung-chul! Because it tries to make the audience to feel like Soo-hyeon; to want revenge too. Some acts are way over the top and I kinda disliked it. You see someone take a huge beating, I mean, HUGE, and the other day he's walking around like he just fell out of the stairs.

If however a white lie. The synopsis states ""...through a series of catch and releases."" This is misleading. There are two instances of this, I'd not really call that a series.Also, there's hardly any torture; you'd think that with what the bad guy did (and continues to do, thanks to the protagonist's negligent idiocy), not just to the pregnant fiancee but countless other girls, he'd warrant more torture, yeah? So, he gets beat up a bit, broken wrist, sliced Achilles, and stabbed cheek. That's it. The Achilles thing was intense but I expected a lot more.The ending was a total letdown. Guillotine? After he was begging for instant death? Come on. The dialogue following it was silly. ""I don't know pain."" Clearly he did; pain isn't in the mind, it's physical. So there could've been more done. ""That one scene"" in Law Abiding Citizen will probably never be topped. This was child's play in comparison. Oh and at the end, yeah, let's traumatize the hell out of his whole family.

As a matter a fact, the plot has a lot of holes as its neglected due to completely dedicated work on pathological mutilation of human flash which was much more American movie trade mark than Korean. Most of Korean movies are great because they keep your attention by clever plot and suspense, not by amount of bizarre scenes collected. In one recent interview director John Carpenter said that it is pretty easy to imply shock on the screen but it doesn't give the final shape of the movie. It is much more difficult to imply suspense because it informs us about the characters and with that information we exactly now why our character shouldn't do this or go there ... and this is what nails us to the screen. We can't see much of that here except in one moment when movie has one twist point but everything else is pretty much expected and as good old John says - we are just staying shocked. I don't get 8 grade for this movie while some real gems of Korean cinema stay completely ignored on IMDb.",I Saw the Devil
99,deastman_uk,New boy,8,22 April 2011,"Oldboy indicated that there was a new genre on the block. A film full of violence and revenge, but very much trapped in the human mind. No attempt to shove the viewer into the supernatural or the spiritual. Asian cinema often learns style from Hollywood but never taste. I saw the Devil has a less inward feel than Oldboy; the scenarios are more familiar to audiences fed on modern thrillers and horror tropes. This leaves the mechanics of the head to head battle between the two main characters more exciting - think Infernal Affairs.The violence is relentless, but it is obvious early on that violence stands in for desperation - not some ersatz authority. This is what gives the film its unique track. Everyone is a victim.This is a gruesome ride; fast, often unpleasant, with no reliance on tricks or twists. Because of the attention to detail, it is more than the sum of its parts. At the end you will be satisfied, though probably not enlightened.",I Saw the Devil
100,quinimdb,I Saw the Devil,7,18 March 2016,"I like what this movie was going for. I like that it delivers a protagonist who's actions are all morally gray. I like that in trying to be a hero, the protagonist might just have become a villain himself, and I like that it suggests that we all have the potential to be as ruthless as the characters in this movie. The cinematography is very good, the action scenes are well shot and edited, the acting is great and the depiction of the brutal violence is very well executed (see the infamous car stabbing scene) and necessary for a film like this. But this movie has one fatal flaw.As much as I like all of what it was going for and how it was executed, the ideas in the film are simply dragged out for too long. In my personal opinion, I think this movie could have been 1 hour and 45 minutes long and had the same impact, or even more so. The problem is that about 1 hour and 45 minutes into the film or so, the point has been made and it's been made well. But the rest of the film is still there, and it definitely drags. Also, once one has sustained so much brutality over that period of time, eventually the effect begins to wear off with the violence. After that much of it, it doesn't seem as brutal as it originally did. I just think had the film ended 20 or 30 minutes earlier, it would've been a better film.",I Saw the Devil

It is violent, but also has twists and nice ending, and is fun and memorable and original. It also shows the price of revenge, but also various kinds of depravity.

102,ThreeGuysOneMovie,Beautifully shot and incredibly brutal,8,3 June 2012,"On a snowy night on an isolated road, a woman sits and waits for a tow truck to fix her flat tire. A stranger drives by and volunteers to help. The woman declines but by then it is too late. She is brutally beaten and dragged off by the stranger. He takes her to an abandoned building tortures, kills, and dismembers her.Unfortunately for the killer, what he doesn't realize is that the woman he just murdered was engaged to a secret agent with a propensity for violence that matches his own. The agent gets a list of potential suspects and starts working his way through the names brutalizing them as he goes. Eventually he finds the man that killed his wife and rather than kill him right away he begins to hunt and stalk the killer slowly. Getting his revenge through a series of increasingly brutal tortures.Well all I can say about this one is just wow. I am going to throw out a bunch of cliché movie review term now because they are all applicable: Unrelenting, visceral, brutal, gritty.The story itself is pretty interesting as the lines between good and evil, hero and villain, become blurred. But what really makes this movie great is the performance by Min-sik Choi as the serial killer. His is outstanding and just oozes evil and menace. You may recognize him from Old Boy. If you don't, then you should add that movie to your DVD queue as well. Byung-hun Lee also does an admirable job playing a character who is conflicted by his desire for brutal revenge and at the same time, horrified by what he is doing.I Saw the Devil is a beautifully shot and at times incredibly brutal. This is not a movie for everyone. If you are not a fan of the genre you may be getting yourself in way over your head. There is a ton of violence and definitely some scenes that you will not easily forget. There is a taxi cab sequence that was like nothing I have seen in a long time.My only complaints are that at two and half hours the movie seems to run a bit long.During some of the final scenes the plot starts to get a bit out of hand. Also, at times the violence seems to be there purely for the shock value and the movie could have stood on its own without it.I Saw the Devil is a clever revenge movie with some great performances. If you are a fan of the horror genre then this movie is a must see. Others may find this one to be a little bit more than they can handle.check out our film site at 3guys1movie.com",I Saw the Devil
103,cadillac20,"One of the ugliest, most gruesome revenge films in a long, long time",8,30 March 2011,"Korea really knows how to take a genre and push it. They did so in horror with my all time favorite horror film, A Tale of Two Sisters. They did so last year with The Man From Nowhere, a revenge film that gives Taken a run for it's money. And now I Saw The Devil, which takes revenge and torture to new heights. Similar to the aforementioned Man from Nowhere, Devil tells the story of one man's quest for revenge after a brutal and psychotic serial killer murders his pregnant wife. That's about all there is to it, but it's certainly enough. The film does a good job of questioning what makes a monster. Kyung- Chul, our insatiable psychopath, is certainly an irredeemable killer. And we're all along with Soo-Hyun, our hero, to get his revenge, as any man would want it after what befalls him. But his method, while a fun play with the standard revenge fantasy formula, is far too brutal, even for us, and becomes so similar to Kyung-Chul, that you call into question your own reasoning. Suffice to say, this isn't a fun film to watch. It's unflinchingly brutal in it's execution, as the camera doesn't often turn away until just after the most squeamish of moments. In this sense, it's almost a relief, and it doesn't pad around it's audience trying to be fun and suggestive. It's more realistic and ugly in it's deal, hammering it's point across hard.That may be a problem for some, but at the same time, it's a bit like a glorious train wreck. You shouldn't enjoy watching this, but the cat and mouse aspect is interesting and fascinating to watch. It's a bit like watching two chess players go at each other, only their both men using psychotic means to hurt one another. And it's a good lesson. When Soo- Hyun goes to far with his revenge, you know he's bound to pay the price eventually. The film could have gone far south, as it might if produced under the same banner as a film like one of the SAW series. However, it's well produced, acted, and it looks great. The colors are nicely desaturated to give it that feel of something ugly and sick. The actors both do a terrific job, both acting as monster in their respectful ways. While we don't learn as much about these characters as we probably could have, they still remain fascinating, particularly Choi-Min-sik, who plays Kyung-Chul as a psycho should be played: ruthless, spontaneous, and without remorse, pain, or fear. He's a fascinating character to watch and a model for any villain who wants to be truly terrifying and disturbing.I Saw The Devil is another winner from Korea, whose film industry seems to revel in the ugly and horrific. It's the first film I've seen from the country in a while that truly stands at the industry's top and hopefully we'll get to see it take on the same kind of iconic status as other well known Korean films.",I Saw the Devil
104,jonnyfendi,Will Shock You to the Edge of Your Seat,8,1 March 2011,"I challenge you how many times do you have to cover your eyes with your hand during thiz film? The movie is so fertile, it makes ""The Last House on the Left"" (2009) and ""I Spit on Your Grave"" (2010) look like plastic trees. The violence level will shock you to the edge of your seat. A secret agent found his fiancée brutally murdered by the hand of a psychopath serial killer. With all the power he has, the agent hunts down the killer and avenge him through the mercilessly pains he could possibly do. The power of thiz movie doesn't come from its story which is predictable but still it leaves you a little twist in the ending, but how the Director describes it so well and brilliantly gritty. The fact is Korea Media Rating Board had forced the Director (Jee-Woon Kim) to cut and edit the violent contents in thiz film. Although after the re-editing, in some scenes it still will mark something in your mind, especially the killing scenes and violence against women. It's not a recommended film for viewers with weak heart. Kim is known for his previous works such as ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" (2003) and ""The Good, The Bad, The Weird"" (2008). In thiz revenge thriller, the image is colorful with precise lighting and stunning cinematography. The throbbing Score works along harmoniously through every scene. However, the focus of thiz movie undoubtedly is on two main characters. Both bring a depth of emotion in their character developments. As NIS agent, Byung-Hun Lee (who is previously known as Storm Shadow in ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"" {2009}) gives a resolute and complex character, on one side he performs the vengeance without platitude, and on the other side we could still see his brittle emotion. As the killer, Min-Sik Choi (who is previously known for ""Oldboy"" in 2003) provides a convincing crazy psychopath character that is not afraid of anything. It's a perfect role for Choi. Nothing will prepare you for some atrocious scenes. In the end, after seeing thiz film entirely, something will make you realize who the real devil is, is it the killer? Or is it the man who takes revenge on him? Since both of them bring unmerciful heat to their actions. Although they come from different direction and motive, finally they meet in the middle anyway, they are the same. It's a good contemplation. Every person has the devil inside them. The difference is how far we can tame it? Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",I Saw the Devil
105,80sHorror,"Gritty, Raw and Engrossing: What a film!,",10,23 March 2012,"I have been really looking forward to 'I Saw The Devil' and boy, did it deliver the goods. I've found in the past that some of his work has been a little patient, in that everything takes a while to get going. Whilst 'A Tale of Two Sisters' is simply brilliant, it is an example case to some extent.On the contrary, you won't have a minute to catch your breath with 'I Saw The Devil' as it explodes into life in no uncertain terms, with a very violent and gut-wrenching murder. The pace never slackens and the running time slips by as your thrown from one gripping situation to another.Revenge is the main theme, but there are a lot of clever 'is he doing the right thing' questions posed to the audience throughout. The acting, especially from 'Oldboy' himself and Lee Byung-Hun (A Bittersweet Life) is faultless. The tearful breakdown of the main character (Byung-Hun) in the final scene is as much a release for the character as it is for the ultra tense viewer. Again, a very provocative ending, one that is becoming a trademark of this superb director.It's worth stating the obvious by saying that this is not 'easy' viewing; there are some pretty brutal and graphic scenes, but importantly, all are justified and all are used to heighten the sympathy/hatred for each of the respective lead characters.'I Saw The Devil' is in some ways more sophisticated than many similar films in it's tight genre. Gratuitous it isn't, but brutal, intense and utterly brilliant it most certainly is.A stone-wall 10 Stars.",I Saw the Devil

107,MattBirk,A Must see for Thrill Seekers! *Incredible*,9,31 March 2016,"I'll say this now, as far as thrillers go, I Saw the Devil is one of the best of the millennium. It's heart-wrenching, unpredictable, scary, and oh so tense. The movie is incredibly violent and draws a ton of tension through said imagery and if you can muster the courage to watch, it's incredibly enjoyable.Devil is not only incredibly bleak from a story standpoint but also, the cinematography takes things to the next level. It's incredibly stylized and vivid (reminiscent of Fincher), it truly looks fantastic. Also, Choi Min-sik is amazing as the serial killer, as well as Lee Byung-hun as the hunter. It always irks me when we see the bad guy as incredibly one dimensional and devoid of emotion. Here, we see a ton of the movie through the killer's perspective so we get to see some great acting from Choi Min-sik. He's a loose cannon ready to go off at any moment.The story sounds somewhat simplistic, a serial killer murders the wrong women and the husband comes looking for him. But instead of turning him over to the police and having the movie be one long manhunt, the husband slowly and methodically punishes the man for his misdeeds. But what makes the movie so exciting and satisfying is that the serial killer simply does not learn from his mistakes. He goes from one bad decision to the next, all the while he is being hunted down and consistently maimed. It's simply, incredible.Anyone with a short attention span or someone who needs bloodshed to be entertained should find a lot to like about this movie. It's very fast paced, visually entertaining, and unpredictable (cannibalism may or may not make an appearance). I Saw the Devil is one of the tensest movies I've seen in years. Again, if you can handle extreme violence and can enjoy a very mean-spirited movie, this is a must see.",I Saw the Devil
108,imdb-19548,"Dark, smart and original.",9,7 July 2011,"This starts of with a clichéd attack but moves from there into much more interesting territory.The plot starts off as a serial killer film, angry husbands hunts for his wife's killer, but then moves into a more unusual revenge film.The acting is excellent; Byung-hun Lee has less to do as the dark and mostly silent husband but he is convincing, Min-sik Choi is superb as the killer, he comes across as creepy and disturbed and his performance carries the film, the other actors all deliver reasonable performances but they have little to do.The violence is shocking in it's simplicity, although there are a few martial arts scenes and chase scenes most of the violence is simple and direct and fa more convincing for that, and in some ways that directness is more brutal than the torture scenes.There is some comedy, mostly from the meetings with other killers, but this is fundamentally a very dark film.The ending sticks with the uncompromisingly dark theme, no clichés here.",I Saw the Devil
109,trnjamesbond,I got him! Oh wait I'll let him go! Oh wait got him again! Oops gone!,3,12 January 2012,"This film was apparently made by Koreans. Well that's fine and all...But..We start off with a Texas Chainsaw style film, mixed with a little FBI style ""The Fugitive"" hunting. With a little bit of ""Enemy of the State"", with the tracking device that the ""Fugitive"" poops out.Then the ""Cop"" goes and turns into the monster, by capturing and recapturing the suspect. Boring!!!! Did the Korean film board ever hear of the term called editing? Not everything has to be ""EPIC"". It feels like I'm watching a Godzilla film, filling the boring spots of the story with unneeded drama!I really love the story of this film, I love a lot of the the shots and directing, but it's the fact that this story should of been edited down to about an hour and a half, not a running time of two and half hours. Come on! How many times did this guy catch the killer?!How boring is this idea, it started out great, the good guy caught the bad guy then he let him go, he caught him again then let him go, he then caught him again and let him go.. How repetitive is this?It's like there is to many Chiefs trying to have a say in all the writing. Ya I get it, the main character gets revenge against the cannibal family.. But why all the mundane bull crap in between? Yes I get that the good guy is turning into the ""MONSTER"". But come on!? How many times do you have to catch a guy? It's like watching a cat torturing a mouse. If this happened to Tommy Lee Jones in the ""Fugitive"", I think his and Harrison Ford's career would have been over by now.I just expected more from the Korean film market, not this garbage.Yes I give three stars, because is was nicely shot, a great beginning, and the actors and actresses acted perfectly for what they had to deal with in the script. But for the most part, this film is way too long, not edited properly, and just bored me to death after about an hour.This film seems to me like they wanted to play the audience of the world like we have no idea what good film consists of and the remedy to make one. Anyone that is into films on this site, knows that it was a bit too repetitive.Anyone that watches this and likes it, is simple minded, and loves too much drama, and also loves to relish in the moment way too often. This person also must repeat the same mistakes in their own life without learning from them.Just because it's foreign, new and pretty, doesn't mean it's good. The people that vote this so highly are just as fake and stupid as this film was shot, being all downtown, artsy fartsy! blah! I say to you! Get a life! Instead of sitting in your little downtown ""Cafe's"" listening to your favourite poetry or your favourite local band! Get a life, and quit trying to be someone your not. 7+ rating?!

I loved the fiancé's idea on how to punish the serial killer, after all death is too quick, it'd be too easy an escape. The only thing I'm wondering is if he had the parents find their serial killer son because his own father in law saw his daughter in a similar manner...but also, I think he made it that way because the killer knowing his parents and son are there brought him true fear. They'd see him in such a vulnerable state and also because the door was rigged. Either way, the main character finally got the closure he needed. I don't think it completely eased his pain but it was something he was compelled to do in order to being the grieving process and to make things right.

117,d_art,Movie Review: 'I Saw The Devil',5,1 April 2011,"In I Saw The Devil, Kyung-chul (Choi Min-sik) is an embodiment of evil, a serial killer who mutilates his victims, many of them women. One night, Ju-yeon, daughter of a retired police chief and pregnant fiancée of elite special agent Dae-hoon (Lee Byung Hun), is brutally murdered by Kyung-chul. Obsessed with revenge, Dae-hoon decides to track down the murderer, even if doing so means becoming a monster himself. When he finds Kyung-chul, turning him in is the last thing on his mind. He will make him pay.I was really split on this one. The voyeuristic nihilism of it all was too gross to watch. First off, let me add that this isn't a poorly made film by any technical standards. It's just that it was incredibly unpleasant to experience. I watch films (as long as you pay for them) for entertainment purposes. It is a transactional medium after all. Artistic merit aside, if a person is asked to pay $12 for a movie, the film is asking to be judged on its monetary value. I tend to side with Alfred Hitchcock when he said, ""A good film is when the price of the dinner, the theatre admission and the babysitter were worth it.""Director Kim Ji-Woon is a stylistic director of genre films. From his horror film, Tale of Two Sisters, to action films like A Bittersweet Life and comedic adventures like The Good, The Bad, And The Weird, his films tend not to be complex in plot nor deep, but are visual marvels that are extremely entertaining with maybe a twist at the end. I Saw The Devil is a much darker, depressing, and unsettling departure from his previous works. I felt the director focused too much on shocking the audience. The visuals have richness in color that is typical of his work, but the many scenes of stomach-churning gore and extreme, realistic violence can really dull the senses. Heads and limbs are cruelly cut up, and/or realistically hit with blunt objects or stabbed. Too much for me. Seeing women being cut up and/or raped by a serial killer is depressing and well, too voyeuristic. True, the killer gets his just desserts (boy, does he ever), but I'm more of a fan of the cerebral, ""showing less is more"" style of filmmaking. I like Hitchcock. AdvertisementLee Byung-Hun's acting is pretty amazing here as Dae-hoon. As the husband of a murdered wife, one can truly feel all that is going on in his mind through his restrained expressions and words. He can't cry because he has essentially lost all feeling. He has become like a machine with one purpose—revenge. He has great charisma and screen presence (he played Storm Shadow in G.I. Joe). Throughout the film, he becomes more of a monster as he tries to make the killer pay for his crimes. Choi Min-Sik is absolutely despicable as the serial killer, Kyung-chul. Choi Min-Sik is like Gary Oldman (or probably closer to Russel Crowe in popularity) of South Korea. It's freaky to see him play such an unsympathetic character, which he has no problem doing. The plot itself isn't very complex. The film is more about the characters and their mindset. Kyung-chul has no regard for human life. Dae-hoon has no regard for Kyung-chul's lifeor is there something more? Throughout the film, more details are revealed about Kyung-chul as well as Dae-hoon's vengeful plans.Watching this film was like drinking acid. And, experiencing that may have been the main point of this film. But, c'mon. One doesn't need to constantly be tortured to explain the mercurial, horrifying nature of vengeance. The news is depressing as it is. The film outdoes Park Chan-Wook's Vengeance trilogy quite a bit in terms of shock and gore, but not in its theme. Have we become so desensitized to this stuff that we must always push the boundaries? This version I saw appeared to be uncut. Things do come together in the end, but the painful journey was what stayed with me.",I Saw the Devil

Three times a week you've seen the body recovery scene. Police tape off an area reporters surround taking pictures shouting questions, its mandatory in every ""LAW & ORDER"" episode. Except this director turns it into a scene from ""GLADIATOR"", With the POLICE playing the legions, detectives playing centurions, CSI playing the cavalry, and reporters as the barbarian menace. Instead of just carrying body parts to the CSI van the investigator gets jostled b y the reporter police melee the head goes flying and reporters are admonition for taking photos. A woman calls her boyfriend from the side of the road. Her car has broken down and a stranger wants to help. He plays it off and she disappears. Problem is her dad is a retired police inspector her boyfriend is a high up detective. Not only do they want revenge they want their pride back. The killer the Detective is all-unrepentive in their actions, no apologies in the evil they do, motivated not by passion or justice but by evil. Instead of putting two in the killer's head or arestimicating him the detective follows and harasses him, like a cat playing with a mouse. Allowing the killer to forcibly sodomize a nurse under his watch. Then forces her to treat the killer after he hands him a beating.

127,TheMovieSnob247,Just a fantastic movie!,8,19 June 2014,"This is an awesome film and one of the best I saw in 2011. It's creepy, raw, shocking, dark, twisted... I'm out of adjectives. I really didn't expect much from this, so it was a pleasant surprise, to say the least. It contains the best film maniac I've seen since Javier Bardem in No Country for Old Men; the same actor who was brilliant in Old Boy, Min- sik Choi. This is a wonderfully acted revenge film which is guaranteed to leave an impression. It's probably the best film in the genre since the Kill Bill movies. Be warned though, it's not for the faint of heart; there are quite a few gruesome scenes in this film. Regardless, do yourself a favour and see this as it's not to be missed!Enjoyed my quick review?

This movie gets you right from the get go and doesn't stop. The movie is absolutely relentless, as a viewer there are times you would hope that the movie would give you room to breathe but it doesn't.The movie is clever, dark and very violent. It explores the wickedness of men. This movie is not for the weak of heart.All the actors did an amazing job but the kudos must go to the director for having the guts to make a movie like this.For very deliberate reasons I am not going to go into the story of the movie as I don't want to ruin any surprises this movie has in store for its viewer, all I would say is watch this movie but be warned watching this movie requires a strong stomach.",I Saw the Devil
131,iReviewFilms,Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: I Saw The Devil,8,12 May 2011,"I Saw The Devil follows Kim Soo-hyeon (Byung-hun Lee) who is a highly trained agent. One night while stranded on the side of the road after her car breaks down, Kim's pregnant fiancée is attacked and brutally murdered by Kyung-chul (Min-sik Choi). This isn't the first time he's murdered and it's sure not to be the last. What he doesn't reckon on though is Kim hunting him down for retribution.Both killer and fiancé are continuously interlocked in a game of wits and ever more sadistic acts on both each other and bystanders as they slowly converge towards the end of the movie. As Kim is dragged ever downwards into the world of violence, he treads a fine line with turning into the monster that he is hunting and it is fair to say that many of the scenes in this film will have you feeling slightly uncomfortable if you're not well prepared.Choi impresses as the masochistic killer who is a complete opposite from Lee's calm and collected demeanour. Both actors bring breathe life into their characters that only seem to become more complex as the film unfolds. Having started out as two opposites, they slowly merge into one and it becomes increasingly hard to distinguish who should get the viewers support.I wasn't exactly sure where this movie was going to go especially after an hour when it could quite plausibly have finished with a few tweaks but continue on it did and I am all the more happy because of it. There is plenty of action and fight scenes split in between the character development and where normal revenge films seem to keep both protagonists apart until the end, Jee-woon Kim (the director) was on a mission to bring them together into every scene. The music perfectly suits the mood and is only trumped by the cinematography which was exemplary.As mentioned, this is not one for the faint hearted or squeamish but the performances are fantastic and it really gives an insight into the minds of a serial killer and a man so stricken with grief that he can only comprehend vengeance. This ranks up there with my other favourite Korean movie Oldboy and although I Saw The Devil's plot may be based on a tried and tested idea, its execution is very refreshing and keeps you guessing right until the very end.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com",I Saw the Devil
132,unemployedvirgin,funny and entertaining = brilliant film making!,10,7 November 2011,"amazing storytelling, loved the soundtrack score throughout. min-sik choi has a cape fear style approach to this role which makes it all the more fun to watch. the irony of a man becoming a monster whilst chasing one is something that's been attempted a lot in the past, but this is a true example of it going picture perfect.the gore, vulgarity and obscene all came across to me as a comical mixture of dark humour, which made it all the more palatable. solid acting, good picture from beginning to end. highly recommended for horror fans searching for an alternative.since i have to have a minimum of 10 lines of text..the only thing i can really add is: when first i saw the trailer it actually put me off wanting to invest time in the movie, but now i realise that by giving little away it provided such me with such a good visual experience!",I Saw the Devil
133,robinhio84_,"Definitely worth watching, but know that the first hour is best",7,6 December 2020,"I SAW THE DEVILWow, mixed feelings over this one. To review this movie imo it's best to split it in two parts with a bridge between both parts.PART I - Horror / Thiller
Takes place in the first hour. From the first scene, you will be hooked. We get presented the psychopath killer from the get go. Ruthless and totally crazy. The movie really shines here, without giving away anything of the plot, you can expect original takes on a normally fatigued plot/genre. I would rate it a 8.5.But part one doesn't end with the finishing/incarceration of the murderer. And actually continues. There is bridge scene between the two parts that felt out of place. From there the movie goes in a different way, that is totally separate from the first part. We continue the movie in a string of bizarre and very unrealistic events, which is not always satisfying and it can sometimes lead to confusion.PART II - Action / Psychological Thriller (let's dub this part: I TURNED INTO THE DEVIL)First of all the women that survive / are saved: what happens with them? They exit the movie in a way where you see the disregard from the main character. Unless the narrative is that the lead character was set up to be a sociopathical murderer himself from the beginning, it doesn't make sense the just cut the ladies from the movie without a dialogue.If we hold the theory that Kim Soo-hyeon was ripe to be a killer himself it answers the question WHY he would let him go.In part II we get to know two more characters from which the girl acts well, but barely has any substantial role. What we do see there is that Kim Soo knocks her down and doesn't look back once at here (mmm, while writing the review I start to think aboutt Kim Soo's sociopath tendencies). And this would explain my biggest annoyance of the movie. Towards the ending Kim Soo wouldn't even call to warn a people who is in clear danger and after their disappearance he doesn't even inquire about them. They will just be gone??Overal the probably tries to tell a story where each time Kim Soo encounters and mutilates Jang Kyung-chul he also turns more into him. Which by the end of the movie has the climax where Kim Soo set up a guillotine trap which is activated by opening a door. Jang Kung is decapitated by the innocent and sweet family of him. Yeah not really likably for Kim Soo right?And there is this loose end which just don't make sense:
Why is Kim Soo not turned in by the police when he show up at the house, since he clearly has some involvement. Not to speak of his own guilt from the collateral murders. Even after the taxi deaths, Kim Soo intervenes very late at the doctors practice. Anything could have happened to both the doctor and the nurse lady. And how could Kim Soo get away with Jang Kyung without having every police car if not a helicopter chasing them around. The killer even manages to call the head police guy on his mobile and traces people without really explained how he got that information...As you can see by the length of this review, I do care and maybe too much. If the movie is just to sit down and be entertaining it probably is quite good. But for me, someone who really appreciated the first part for being so strong and realistic part II just didn't live up to that. Because I was never bored It would still give the move a 7. Why still a seven? The acting, screen play and the way it is filmed is absolutely perfect. Very very wel done. I can totally see why some people rate this as high as they do, but for me it has to go further then that. Especially since the director did show a movie close to perfection in the first part.If you watch the movie/or already have done so. My questions is what do you think we messages from the director is. Is it related to what is allowed or being accepted and or might it be on how far people can go with taking the right in their own hands or is it something totally different?",I Saw the Devil
134,joben-525-633946,A film I knew nothing about happens to be the greatest of its genre I have ever seen...,9,26 November 2012,"Inexplicably violent and unnervingly disturbing, 'I Saw the Devil' is a superbly crafted Korean revenge flick with a stunning leading cast and it stands out as one of the best in the genre. Kim Soo-hyeon (Byung-hun Lee) is a secret agent with a vengeance following the brutal torture and murder of his pregnant wife Joo-yeon (San-ha Oh). As he narrows his suspects down to just four men, Kim is soon able to track down his wife's murderer Jang Kyung-chul (Min-sik Choi). Kyung-chul is a seriously deranged psychopath who is perfectly portrayed by Min-sik Choi as he and Byung-hun Lee begin to steal the show as latter attempts to make the former feel true justice.The premise and plot may seem familiar however this is much more than other films with similar characteristics such as 'Taken' and 'Kill Bill'. There is a much greater characterisation complexity in the form of hero/villain whilst the film's believable harrowing ability to disturb is what makes it a cut above the others.As the duration tailors off, we become gripped in this powerful action/drama and the personality change within the main characters is thoroughly intriguing.Action and gory moviegoers will get their just deserts with Jee-woon Kim's movie however 'I Saw the Devil' is much more than a 141 minute bloodbath - although it could be called that! 'I Saw the Devil' is a brilliantly thrilling and unnerving Korean movie for many aspects as well as the obvious.",I Saw the Devil
135,kikoydaba3,relentlessly haunting and arresting,9,16 July 2019,"One of those revenge thrillers that can make even the most hardened viewers squirm, I Saw the Devil is a brilliant tale about revenge and loss delivering cinematic goods alongside a twisted human drama.The direction of the film is a standout from the cinematography, editing and action set pieces. Director Kim Jee-woo and cinematographer Lee Mo-gae establishes a moody set with dazzling camera movements. Violence is portrayed without reservation for visceral effect. Scenes are presented to let viewers absorb the emotions and conflict between the characters. The action is breath taking in every word as the gore and violence blend to perfection.Unlike other similar films, the story resonates because underneath the spectacle is an arc of grief, loss and retribution. The main character, Kim Soo-hyun, played by Lee Byung-hun is driven by the death of his wife at the hands of a serial killer, Jang Kyung-chul, played by Choi Min-sik. As the story plays out his revenge comes not only at Jang but also to innocent people and those close to him. Kim intends not only to kill Jang but to torture him and feel the agony his wife endured at his hands. Despite the unrelenting violence, it never fails to be contemplative and introspective and both Lee and Choi dazzle as men with twisted motives. The ending basically sums up the entire point of the film. After his revenge, Kim does not have his wife back. He could only break down crying.I Saw the Devil is a must watch for its entertainment and artistic values.-8.5/10",I Saw the Devil
136,supadude2004,"I Saw The De...eply boring 'Death Wish' Inspired, Violence Fest.",3,1 April 2011,"I'll give nothing away which you can't already know from reading the promotional blurb to this movie.And still, this movie really stands as an insult to one's intelligence. So, let's again examine what this movie is about..Well it is indeed (as you know already from reading its promo material) loosely based upon your standard vigilante ""Death Wish"" (from 1974) formula. Accordingly, do you sincerely expect to see a nasty bad guy who does bad? Do you sincerely expect to see a handsome good guy who does bad in revenge? Do you accordingly expect to witness a nasty bad guy who does bad more than once? Do you expect our vigilante to give up easily? And what about all those beautiful actresses who were just innocently standing around Mr. Jee Woo Kim's film sets? Nice girls...Well, if you don't think you know the answers to such questions, you'll just have to watch the movie to find out. Won't you? Albeit, I would advise as follows, if you are of any sensibly intellectual disposition.Let's just say, without giving anything away, that nothing in this movie surprised me - save for the fact that this reviewer expected a lot more from this director, than this unintelligent drivel, which could only appeal to society's lowest common denominator: Violence addicts may, that is to say, love this movie.Anyway, the leading girls were very pretty. The bad guy antagonist was very nasty. The handsome vigilante protagonist, Byung-hun Lee, is one of South Korea's very best known stars. And in his other movies you can see for yourselves that he is, quite usually, a very talented actor. But alas, if you've seen one ""Death Wish"", you've (...even if this is in a slickly updated Korean based production) seen 'em all...Quite honestly, this was a pathetically 'low brow', waste of production and directing talent. 3/10, unless your IQ is under 110 - in which case it's a must see 'gore fest'!

138,druss44121-1,This movie was a massive disappointment,6,19 March 2011,"Spoilers ahead, folks...I wanted to like it, I really did. And it's very well directed. There's some great shots, such as a rotating shot in a car during an attack. But if you took the exact same script and it was an American movie, it would be laughed out of theatres. The arc of the main character makes no sense. Worse, I don't even know what his purpose was. He devises a plan that's supposedly some ""awful"" torture for the serial killer, but it's so obvious it will go off the rails. Even ignoring moral questions, it just seems stupid on all levels as far as exacting successful revenge. It's like it wanted to go A Clockwork Orange and have it be about conditioning a sadist to no longer be able to hurt and kill, but it never really takes that idea anywhere. Min-sok gives another great performance, but again the script...*MAJOR SPOILERS* Why catch and release? Why? What possibly point or purpose would there be to do that? It's nice to see a film not go all Hostel, but since the only time the serial killer really gets it is through physical torture, what was the point? He just makes it so things are out of his control and others can be hurt and, eventually, even his own family can be harmed. It's just stupid.If they wanted to do a conditioning thing then add some plot device (since the guy's basically Korean CIA) where he has a shock device or something surgically put in the killer so he can stop him dead in his tracks at will i.e. Clockwork Orange. But as it is, it's like... a) how is this worse torture or the ideal justice? and b) there's so many ways this can go wrong and c) aren't you worried about whoever else might come into this guy's path? To me, a movie can unrealistic (like the heightened reality of Oldboy or near Looney Toones nature to some of Leone's stuff) and still make sense WITHIN its world.I mean, in I Saw the Devil you're already making a great leap that this CIA guy is immediately gonna go all rogue and beat up whoever and be able to track down the serial killer fairly easy (he just happens to be on the list of suspects) and all of that. And that's the stuff I can buy. There's also a lot of suspension of disbelief in all the serial killers we meet during the film. I felt like, gee, is South Korea just made up of serial killers?But when you get to a character motivation, a character's point of purpose, even in an overdone or fantastical setting, I still need to buy that. To use Oldboy as an example, in Oldboy, I'm with Oh-Deasu. I want to know what happened. In The Good the Bad and the Ugly, we see why all 3 characters want to find the treasure, and how they all get involved, and why what they're doing to get to it makes sense for their own motives. Yeah, it's not ""realistic"" and it doesn't need to be, but character motivations, or at least - what characters HOPE to get out of doing something - is clear. Why THEY at least think their plan should be successful makes sense.In I Saw the Devil, it's like they're trying to use the same fancy logic to explain a gaping plot hole. If the film was really about the emotions of revenge, we probably would have gotten more than just ONE emotion, as well, which is rage.Even just one change, like a shock device put into his body surgically, or some government stuff like that, and the story would have made better sense as to why the main character thinks he has ""control"" over the serial killer, and then the serial killer has more of an uphill battle and it's more of a true cat and mouse story. You know, take a page from Clockwork Orange. And if they do remake this (which if you have to remake a Korean film, do it to something like this rather than near perfect films like Oldboy or A Bittersweet Life), please, use something like A Clockwork Orange for inspiration. Because as is, this just doesn't work. The entire time you're just thinking, ""stupid, stupid, stupid!"" If you're not with the character taking that journey with them, in a revenge film like this, what's the point?In conclusion: Oldboy this ain't.",I Saw the Devil

Given the severe beatings, to the head, that are delivered, it's hard to imagine any of the victims survived them.
I was also surprised that the detective never seemed to give any thought to those people victimized by the killer after the detective kept letting him go. There were at least a half dozen of them. In my mind. And, when the police finally became aware of what the detective was doing, they didn't seem to care. Except for a brief outburst by the police chief.

142,jrwygant,you can't make this acceptable by calling it art,1,5 March 2012,"The acting was good, the cinematography was good, the directing was good, but the theme is unremitting glorification of violence, notably brutal violence against women. If this movie had left out the women and the sex, and pitted the bad guy against other men, I suspect we'd find fewer favorable comments here. Being able to overwhelm the viewer with graphic scenes of rape and mutilation does not constitute art. This is porn, no matter how nicely it is dressed up. With regard to the narrative line of this film, it makes little sense, as someone else has already pointed out. Catch and release is good in fishing, not in a serious film.",I Saw the Devil
143,kangarooconnor,Just Bad,1,9 June 2021,"There is no logic to any of this, not a single moment of this film was enjoyable. We have numerous amounts of gore and violence for no real reason, violence is used drastically when it makes little to no sense for the sake of the plot, multiple rape scenes that only serve as time wasters for the protagonist to reach the antagonist.The moment that annoyed me most was when our antagonist, for the second time being released, goes and has a chummy meal with his cannibal buddies. What? We go from a catch and release thriller to a goofy over bloodied and bizarre 1993 slasher film. To enter a countries secret service agency one must be quite intelligent compared to the average man, and our protagonist shows that he must have been a part of the special people's class in the academy. What did he think was gonna happen by letting him go, sure it allowed him to find and kill multiple other murderers and killers but purely by chance. The insertion of other murderers and killers only act as a justification for the protagonists idiotic decisions to let Jung escape. This weird secret world of Korean murderers is like the end of a bad joke the story writers made up in the board room.Now for what I believe is to be the most controversial point of the movie, the violence. I've heard many complain that those who dislike these movies but like say John wick or other revenge action movies are hypocritical. However I'd like to counter with the simple phrase of ""John Wick wasn't trying to make some point."" John wick was literally ""you kill my wife's dog and beat me up, I kill you."" This movie and many others like it try and link some point about ""making the bad guy realize he was a bad guy"" or ""the protagonist must become as bad as the antagonist."" No, this is a movie with a lot of blood and gore for the sake of having a lot of blood and gore, there is no ""point"" to be made except that monsters exist and must be wiped out.There's no sympathy from me towards the protagonist because he caused 70% of his pain, instead of just finding the man and killing him and being done with it he allowed the bad guy to escape multiple times and cause further havoc. And, what was the point of the ending? Why make the son and parents suffer seeing their (albeit POS son) die? It only makes the protagonist even more unlikable. There was no point, no goal and no justification for creating a movie so inept and uncle Ed while also filling it with excessive amounts of amped up gore for shock value.",I Saw the Devil
144,TheOnlyOwen01,One of the best Korean movies I've seen,9,1 November 2020,"I rewatched this last night and I was surprised by how well it held up. It wasn't as good as I remember it watching it for the first time in 2019 but it's still very good. The premise of I Saw The Devil is simple: the wife of a cop is brutally murdered by a crazed serial killer and the cop seeks revenge but with a twist: when he first captured the killer, he put a tracking device in his body so he could find him and beat him up some more to make his punishment worth it but in the process becomes what he's after himself: a monster.I never considered this a horror movie like a lot of other people have but more of an action thriller but there are definitely terrifying moments in the film, the opening scene being a prime example as it plays out almost like an 80s slasher flick. This film is insanely violent. The gore effects are incredibly convincing and the violence can be pretty realistic at times but it doesn't glorify it as it all serves a purpose to the plot and fits in with the characters who are played by actors who give fantastic performances.Despite all of blood and gore and intense action sequences, the narrative is very strong. The plot may come off as goofy or generic at first but how it's executed makes it original especially considering that the movie is pretty long yet it never bores in the slightest although I could feel the length towards the end. cinematography is also fantastic as everything looks mucky and grey which fits the tone perfectly.Overall, I Saw The Devil is one of my favorite Korean films. I wouldn't quite say it's my favorite but it's up there. The film has great acting, great effects, an interesting story and immaculate pacing. This movie is terrific. It's rare whenever I rewatch movies but this film has a surprising rewatch value to it that most other movies don't have and I say that about a movie then it's something special.",I Saw the Devil

Kudos for that bloodbath.Aside from a good plot and crazy cat and mouse play between the killer and Byung-hun Lee's character that does kind of get a bit out of control after a point, it has a pretty good ending that's not been done before and I applaud that too. Camera work has some nice saturated colors and scenes--such as the greenhouse scene with the kidnapped schoolgirl--and the acting is very, very good.

It delivers on a whole other level, talk about pain and suffering manifested in the most horrific and gutwrenching way, I've seen my share of revenge films, and many of them lose focus on what's important, which is the emotions, this film highlights that in a significant way, to a point where you find yourself invested in the story, you expect a certain feeling, you crave it, the need for satisfaction is overwhelming, what it essentially does is awaken this deep-rooted primal need for revenge that I'm sure that every one of us possess, it is absolutely amazing to see a film provoke such a reaction from its viewers.
Let's talk a little bit about the characters. This film has fantastic performances across the board, from the minor characters to the leads, you can tell that the director invested a lot towards the cast and it pays off, but what stands out the most here is the depiction of a psychopath, Choi Min-Sik who plays the antagonist performs flawlessly as he dives in his diabolical persona, this by far one of the best showcases of a psychopath in recent years.This film left me in a state of awe.

148,Icedooitle,No Satisfaction,8,13 December 2015,"Few films that are saturated with violence use it as a theme. Even the most blood drenched revenge films don't explore action and carnage beyond glorifying them as a necessity to bridge plot checkpoints. Protagonists are forgiven brutality in the name of justice, and villains rarely provoke sympathy because their success is often dictated by how bad they can be. Never have I seen a movie that so honestly offers revenge as a false motivation to inflict violence as ""I Saw the Devil.""Kim Soo is your familiar hero with ""a particular set of skills."" When his fiancé is discovered dismembered in the river, the motivation for vengeance is set and the wheels of a formulaic plot start turning. If this film were 30 minutes long, it would have been just that. There comes a moment of revelation when Kim has his fiancé's killer, Kyung, dead to rights. Kim is in a premium position to end the man's life and avenge his beloved, but something holds him back. The finality of Kyung's death won't bring enough satisfaction. The prospect of revenge leading to closure has been proved false too many times for this character to fall into that trap. Instead, he leaves him beaten without even a word of warning. This is only the first act.For the rest of the film, Kim uses his resources as a government agent to play a game of cat and mouse that is closer to ""Hostel"" than ""Heat."" Kim rationalizes his releases of fury by intervening with Kyung's attempts at murder and rape. Kyung catches on quickly to Kim's mentality and welcomes Kim into his world of monsters by being his victim. The psychology of their dynamic grows grayer and murkier with each encounter until power roles shift and violence stops being justifiable from any party.There are classic themes about hubris and vengeance at the core of ""I Saw the Devil,"" but it is unmistakably original in its execution. With the obstacles that Kim has to overcome, there is still never a sense of perseverance. His struggles are self-inflicted after the moment he lets Kyung walk free. The violence is senseless and the film is making a case to prove it.",I Saw the Devil

It was a good decision that I started it at 7PM as its a 2.5 hrs long movie!!! So the movie starts with the killer kidnapping and killing a girl. A very normal move for serial killer movie. And, if the last movie u saw was ""THe chaser"" this is even more normal.Then her husband starts looking for the killer and within 15 minutes finds him. I thought the movie might be on the search for the killer (other than that I could not imagine how they might be able to build a suspense). Now that the killer is found and 1hr 45 mins is still left I was surprised what is still left.Well I WAS surprised by the later offering!!! The movie I realized is actually a revenge drama and the brutality only reminded me of ""Sympathy for lady vengeance"". At times ISTD surpassed the violence of that movie but failed to build the suspense. It failed to make me angry enough to the killer to kill him like ""The Chaser"" did. It failed to make me one with the protagonist of the movie and if can't be one with the protagonist u fail to enjoy a movie.At times it really bored me and then there is the unnecessary plot of friends of the killer. What was their contribution in the plot? Nothing! The plot of the movie is good. Punishing the killer every time he tries to commit the sin again. But I've one question, our protagonist was a cop and he took the decision of keeping the killer alive...did he not ever realize that in this process he's risking the lives of more people! In the events later at least 4-5 more people died because he kept him alive. May be that was the intent but that is the reason I lost sympathy for him and his reason.Then the climax. Again gr8 starting but the punishment was not apt. Keeping him alive for days and then just killing him in front of his parents! What does this achieve?!! He's already dead!!! He's not going to feel shame, guilt or pain but his old parents and an innocent little kid has to go through the trauma for the rest of their life.If he had to be punished and to make him beg for death everyday...I had something in my mind... cut his both palms, one leg, tongue, pen1s and leave him near a hospital... for the rest of his life he would be forced to beg and pray for death. Our hero can visit him everyday, insult him, beat him and then leave him to live.The movie deserves 5.8 to 6 out of 10 for what it is but the extra 1.5 points is given only for the violence and brutality and the realism in them.Watch ""Sympathy for lady vengeance"" for a good revenge movie. And the chaser is best in this category any day.",I Saw the Devil

154,patbradley435,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible",1,11 February 2015,"I cannot believe how bad this excuse of a movie is. It is chronically bad and I cannot understand why it has got such a high rating on IMDb. Some have compared it to Se7en and Silence of the Lambs. That is just pure ridiculous. The serial killer is simply plain stupid and ludicrous in the utmost extreme. The script is dire and the person responsible for it should be sent to North Korea for a long holiday. The story is dumb and an insult to anyone's intelligence. A total waste of time. I truly felt cheated big time by this incompetent mess that truly staggers the imagination. It's just a gore fest and one that's not even done well. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!! WHAT A PURE DUMB PIECE OF RUBBISH THIS TRULY IS!!! This will set South Korea's movie-making credentials back in time. Total DRIVEL.OK, when I wrote the first part of this review (all of above) I gave up watching after 1 hour and 6 minutes because of its dire screenplay - utterly stupid. So I decided to switch it back on and see if it could get any worse. I was shocked at how bad it became. The two serial killers are pure and simple imbeciles. There is also a rape sequence that is the stupidest and most laughable thing I've ever seen. Also the beatings that the serial killer takes and repeatedly survives defies belief. The whole story is total nonsense and one of the stupidest screenplays I've ever had the misfortune to have seen. I am now staggered to see so many good reviews about this crazy film. It's making me suspicious about some of the reviewers on here. Some get mediocre reviews, such as Eden Lake (6.9), which is 100 times better than this tosh. This is film making at its very worst. Hollywood would never consider doing a remakes of this as it would bomb because of the stupid story and how really crazy it is. I just can't believe people think this is a good movie. The gore is overdone, but overdone gore doesn't make a good movie, a story well told does. This has no semblance of one. Pure and utter tripe. The main protagonist cries at the end of the movie. I now understand why. Really, really BAD FILM.",I Saw the Devil

Eyes Without a Face, Silence of the Lambs, Se7en, Oldboy all told fascinating stories with the use of extreme violence, but sadistic violence - especially against women - has become so commonplace that it depresses me. Shot of a young woman. The murderer approaches. Realization on her face. Abduction. She's raped or tortured as she begs. He kills her. Corpse disposal.Shot of a young woman. The murderer approaches. Realization on her face. Abduction. She's raped or tortured as she begs. He kills her. Corpse disposal.Shot of a young woman. The murderer approaches. Realization on her face. Abduction. She's raped or tortured as she begs. He kills her. Corpse disposal.I disliked this about Luther, an otherwise very fine series. But none of its depictions even approached I Saw the Devil, which is a parade of brutality without end.I Saw the Devil is the movie you'd make if you thought The Chaser was good because it had shots of a woman's blood spraying the face of the guy who's destroying her skull with a hammer.Women don't exist in this movie except to be brutalized. Shot of a young woman. ... Corpse disposal. To its credit, the filmmakers cleverly play on expectations by stopping the process halfway once in a while. A young woman may be approached by the murderer, realize she's being abducted, then get raped or tortured without getting killed because he gets interrupted.People defend this by saying, ""these things exist in our world, and movies are brave for showing them!"" Actually, no, they don't. Special agents who bug serial killers to play a catch-and-release game? Don't exist. An advanced nation with no visible law enforcement or mass media? Doesn't exist. Let's get this out of the way - this movie doesn't have a whiff of realism. It's an extremely stylized parable that has confused sadism with profundity. If you want to see people get murdered ""authentically,"" go watch a jihadist video.Shot of a young woman. The murderer approaches. Realization on her face. Abduction. She's raped or tortured as she begs. He kills her. Corpse disposal. And for 2 and a half hours!Last night I saw The Raid 2, which is another 2 1/2 hours of mutilation and murder. But at least it was a straight-up action movie about a battle between criminals. Watching a psychopath dominating a helpless person and eventually taking their life is an infinitely sicker experience... and there's so much of it in this movie. So much of it.I've always liked horrors and thrillers. But I Saw the Devil is so drenched in hideousness, that whatever trite moral point it makes about ""becoming the monster,"" it was not worth watching another young woman tortured as she begs for her life, or the dull sound of her meat as the killer butchers her and throws the chunks into a bin.The characters in this thing may have immersed themselves in barbarism, but we don't have to.",I Saw the Devil
156,FullBush,One top-notch Thriller,9,6 February 2017,"Well, there is no doubt Quentin Tarantino praised the movie. When a movie is great, it is great for everybody. This thriller kept me strapped till the very end and for some time after that. Well, genres are limited but perspective can be new. And this movie has catered a very fresh one. This movie has become one of my most favorite revenge movies. The thing I liked the most was that gravity of the situation didn't require any emphasis. None of the actors had to convince the audience for empathy. The overall cast was subtle about it. Starting with acting, this movie has Min-Sik Choi, the guy in Old Boy and Lucy. He knows his job and like always gave a godly performance. The protagonist was completely in the match with Choi and so were the girls.Coming to music, it was absolutely mesmerizing, defined the scenes better than dialogues and bound all the factors together. Direction is of the highest order, with use of a very succinct conversation formula, he has managed to bring out the correct intensity at correct moments. Climax can be anticipated but that doesn't make it any less of a thriller. Movies like these have made Asian thrillers the best ones in business. The word ""Asian"" excludes Bollywood, which has again done a disdainful job in copying and making a crap like movie titled ""EK VILLAIN"". Watch ""I Saw the Devil"" and get hooked.

The problem I have with this is that the story does not justify the well over 2 hour run time. Had some of the useless filler been taken out the story and entertainment value would have been better. There are a number of issues with how some of the characters are developed. Mostly the police are rather dim when it comes to solving crime. Our ""hero"" makes some questionable decisions as well. Why allow a serial killer to keep going out and killing more people? I get the whole revenge angle, but to have others die for his revenge makes him seem like he is no better than the other killers.There is a fair bit of blood and gore with this movie which could be off putting to some people.

161,imdb3-3,South Korea silences the lambs,10,22 March 2016,"This might be one of the greatest horror films I've ever seen. What's frightening is that the characters are real people and not the caricatures that they are such as Hannibal Lechter, who somehow knows everything as if there is some secret computer and pipeline that feeds him knowledge he could never know. This movie is about the transformation of a police officer who is traumatized in the process of hunting down a true psychopath. And in the course of his transformation, the righteous transforms into the righteous hunter seeking revenge and not only justice.Everything from the script to the music to the production is at the highest level. And let us not forget the actors who are top notch. Gripping, edge of your seat and rewatchable. This is one of those few international films where reading the subtitles is mandatory because voice overs will not suffice. And you simply get lost in the tale as it moves along and gets more complicated and ugly.There really isn't anything I can compare the film to because it stands alone. And thankfully there is no prequel or sequel. And the best part is that the film provides the kind of ending that is visceral, satisfying and certainly not cliché.

162,Tralequang,Quite disturbing but extremely engrossing,9,9 April 2020,"I saw the devil is, first and foremost, a revenge story, and it has done well in this aspect. Although there exist a few plot conveniences, the plot is captivating with endless action and twists.
The centre of discussion, however, is the sheer amount of graphic violence portrayed. The movie, with all its blood and dismemberment, chills the audience to their visceral core. However, the idea is not to scare the audience away by sight, but to terrify them by thoughts. The violence looks beautifully real, and we cannot help but to feel the pain the victims are going through, as well as wishing revenge on the callous criminal.
The protagonist, a secret agent, is the boyfriend of one of the victims. His indescribable loss evolved into his desire to revenge in the most satisfying way. As he constantly captures and releases the culprit, he wanted the monster to experience what the victims went through: immense pain and desperation.
Things get philosophical when the secret agent steps to the blurry line between exacting revenge and drawing sadistic satisfaction out of it. It becomes even more thought-provoking when we, as the audience, also wanted to see the criminal suffer incessantly. Is this kind of vengeance right? If yes, where is the stop mark? And just who are we to make such judgement?

Just like Code of Hammurabi. But I wonder why I feel uncomfortable with this movie showing this psychotic mad murderer Kyung-chul openly got punished to death. I guess this is because that was too much. The film described it excessively brutal. Furthermore, there are lots of victims due to Soo-hyeon's revenge. Revenge calls for another revenge. It was a good and fresh ending that Kyung-chul got beheaded. On the other hands, I was sorry for his son. What if the son realized he killed his father? That might be the completion of revenge, but innocent people hurt.

Cinematically, I enjoyed the cinematography, as there were certain times where I would notice the uniqueness of a shot set up. Also, the sound – or lack thereof- was very powerful in moments.

We just now that it's cinematic pacing is going to be excellent. I think that is the reason why this movie is so engaging. Each scene has it's own musical score and it's intensely acted. Lead actors Byung-hun Lee who plays Kim Soo-hyeon the protagonist, displays a brilliance yet tactical urgency for his planned out revenge and eventual torture of the man who threw his life upside down.Lead antagonist Min-sik Choi who plays the Devil Kyung-chul is one of the better villains in the last few years that we have seen in cinema. His ruthless, pure brutal disregard, and lack of emotion really set him in a league of his own. Even under immense pressure and animosity does he stay true to his role and executes it with precision. His acting is in a league of it's own, even his presence is chilling to the core, his witty word play is unmatched in intellect and delivery. For me without a doubt this was the movie of the year of 2010, at least in the horror genre. It's plot, gorgeous cinematic pieces, top-notch acting, and some of the most brutal scenes we have seen in a long time. Leave an imprint into your skull that I Saw the Devil is truly a notch above the rest. In a year without tons of outstanding flicks we must thank director Jee-woon Kim and everyone else who worked on this project for their ultimate precision to detail, complete lack of censorship, and a movie raw to the core with honesty. We ""the fans of horror"" are truly appreciative of you and your art form. Your brilliant pacing has people hooked from the very beginning, and leaves us hanging on the edge of our seats until the very last second, and even beyond. As your brain takes time to comprehend what you just saw.In no way is this a movie for everyone. But if you have read this far, I'm sure you can already get the picture if you would enjoy this film. It contains some of the most realistic murder and rape scenes that we have seen in quite a while. It's violent and gory to the core. It's also filled with an amazing rendition of musical scores to either darken, brighten, or heighten the films mode. Everything is top notch and this gets my ultimate stamp of approval. Please do yourself the favor and watch the ""uncut"" subtitled version in 1080p, view the movie as how it was meant to be viewed. You won't regret it. I Saw the Devil will not only remain one of the best films of 2010, it will be watched 10 years from now with the same relevancy and brutality that it has brought us this year.

It has elements vaguely similar to a clockwork orange, with the villain being thrown into the world as a wounded animal.The problem is that the story quite simply falls apart midway. The killer miraculously recovers from a wound that would leave him barely able to walk, if at all. He also has a broken wrist but somehow is able to use it. The protagonist's family are then brutally raped murdered by the killer as he gets an upper-hand, which borders on absolute absurdity if you think about it.The director obviously did not bother to think through the realities regarding the condition of the antagonist, but it's too obvious for me to suspend my belief.The story is very grim, as the antagonist is a completely despicable serial killer, which is a credit to the actor, but the overarching theme of the movie about revenge's cost is just slapshod over the second half of the movie is just forced and simplistic.This movie could've gone several different ways that I would've preferred, but I didn't make the movie now, did I? 5/10",I Saw the Devil

He wouldn't cease killing everybody in range although this must have brought unwanted heat on him. The special agent doesn't care about casualities although he tortures the murderer in the name of his wife (or fianceé?), which is totally inconsistent and makes no sense. The police is totally inept and don't get me started on the victims behavior.After killing the first ""release"" the whole plot became ridiculous and messy, the violence pointless and as the motivations and deeds of the characters were revealed as fantastic, stupid and inconsistent, I stopped caring about the movie completely and was just waiting for the end, which came way slower than I hoped for.

186,GoldmundX,I saw a bad movie,3,27 June 2011,"Many reviewers who give this movie a good rating assume that most critics are put off by the violence and the bloodshed and then proceed to support their appreciation for the movie by explaining that one needs to look through the (apparently necessary) gore and appreciate the deeper layers of the movie. Well, I wasn't necessarily put off by the gore, although I don't appreciate gore for the sake of gore (I don't like the Saw movies). I think Old Boy was an excellent movie for example. That movie went far beyond violence and gore and covered themes like pain, loss and revenge in a wildly original, meaningful way. 'I saw the devil' attempts to do something similar (at least, that is what I assume), but it fails miserably. The acting is actually quite good, Min-Sik Choi and Byung-Hun Lee are very capable actors, without any doubt. And the story starts off very promising. There's a good build up the first 45 minutes, but after that the story unravels into an inconsistent mess within no time. I deduct that the supposed moral of the story is that revenge cannot heal the inflicted pain, even if you try to live out your revenge in installments. And that in the end revenge backfires and the moral borderline between victim and perpetrator starts to dissolve. Fair enough, I've seen less illuminated morals in movies. But the execution of the idea undermines the whole purpose. A couple of examples: GPS-capsules are solid poop-proof and only flush out with diarrhea? And exactly at what level of mushiness does the capsule decide to go for the exit? These may seem like trivial questions, but are essential to the story development. And mind you, Kimchi tends to be pretty spicy. The first time the serial killer is set loose (temporarily) he happens to catch a ride with two killers (with a dead body in the trunk) - oh, what a coincidence. And of course he kills them, in a moving car. The secret agent discovers the 3 bodies, but somehow this does not convince him that his gamble to keep the serial killer on the loose may harm innocent bystanders (or are we supposed to believe that he knew they were killers and that justice was somehow done, despite the fact that he should know that the killer doesn't just have an appetite for 'guilty' victims as he butchered his fiancée). Many more people end up dead or traumatized because of this gamble. And don't tell me that his hatred and urge for revenge have already completely taken over his rationality and morality at that point - why then proceed 1,5 hours to portray this disintegration? The other cops are supposedly completely incapable and do nothing to stop the carnage. Our cop gone rogue uses his cell phone a number of times to call with the police but they have no way to track him down? Despite the fact that they have GPS capsules with microphones in their arsenal they cannot track down a mobile phone? And even when they meet him at his father in law's house they don't apprehend him? Moreover, when the serial killer decides to surrender to the police, about 50 cops are waiting at the agreed meeting point. Then, our rogue cop comes driving by and while driving pulls the serial killer (waving a knife) into the car and abducts him. And the other cops just stand by, doing nothing. What? All 50 cops came on bicycle or using public transport and cannot pursue a driver who is struggling to subdue a serial killer with a knife while driving? And so on, and so onI'm willing to accept a (tiny) bit of illogicality, coincidence, inconsistency and even plain stupidity in a movie, but a movie should not be build on that. At least, that is my humble opinion. The rating this movie gets on IMDb shows that most viewers don't agree.",I Saw the Devil
187,seanebuckley,Style and Substance Abuse.,4,29 April 2012,"Director Jee-Woon Kim has had a spotty career to date. His breakout, A Tale Of Two Sisters, was a muted, cruel and often confusing tale. It was a case of style over substance, a film that was to ignite the messages boards rather than the average film goers brain. His follow up however, A Bittersweet Life, was thrilling yarn, taking its ques from the coveted American styled thriller. The film concerns an 'enforcer' who is told to do the one job he wont do, obviously this doesn't make his boss very happy. Like i said we've seen this before but these thrillers set up their premise early and the fun is had watching our main character stumble over the finishing line. With 'I Saw The Devil' there is no such care taken, it sees the director plunge head first into the murky and depraved world of torture porn.As an audience we should be asking ourselves what the point of given scene or character action is but the violence here is gratuitous and without merit. Even something as shallow as Saw (Darren Lynn Boussman) which arguably ushered in this new fad to the masses, has a (slightly) veiled point, that some people deserve to die because they don't know how to live. In one scene in I Saw The Devil, our 'hero' is told that 'revenge is for the American movies' it would seem then the notion has been processed for all its hyper real absurdity but still the film makers are intent to make us watch the senseless breaking of limbs and bludgeoning. Just while we are on the point of the bludgeoning (of which there are many), why are these characters still alive after 30 blows to the head with a metal pipe? The answer seems to be so we can have a nice little coincidental expository scene or indeed so the person can be tortured further for our (dis)pleasure.Firstly, the idea of redemption through revenge is one that doesn't sit with me at all. That's not to say i cant have fun watching it, films like Black Rain (Ridley Scott) set up the ensuing redemptive violence with care making the idea of Michael Douglas's impending bloody revenge more appealing. Or take Oldboy for example, with Oldboy, the fun of the revenge is in the complexity of the web spun in its honour. We get nothing here except for the death of his wife (who just happens to be pregnant) and this is surely enough right? Well, no its not. I need to care about the characters first, so i therefore feel for them, if anything further happens to them whether it be directly or indirectly. But that's what the film deals in, actions. Our hero never verbalises his anger, he just acts this leads to a disconnect from him. This fact coupled with the over use of the films killer (Min-Sik Choi) gives the film an uneasy weight toward the dealings of the killer, the film revels in his depravity. Its almost like watching one of the vacuous major horror franchises in which the killer is the main star and the audience come to watch him work. By the end of the movie, i didn't care whether the killer was punished or not, rightly or wrongly. There was nothing holding the movie together, people cried but there is no emotion, this movie is completely soulless. A good juxtaposition to this is The Chaser. The Chaser walks similar lines, we have a depraved serial killer and the man who stop at nothing to exact bloody revenge. The difference here being that the incentive for the hero is not just to kill or maim the bad guy, which is completely uninteresting, our hero learns that there are more important things in the world other than his nihilism. Neither men here have anything real to live for, they are both as bad as each other. Watching as Byung-Hun Lee bludgeons suspected serial killers is not fun, its just wrong.If you want morally murky then Joe Carnahan' s excellent Narc is a fantastic example of good person doing terrible things, under extreme circumstances. In that film, Ray Liotta goes to illegal lengths to gain a conviction and tough justice on the criminal underworld after his partner dies. We really get a sense of character in the film, and you really get a feel for Liotta's choices, however wrong they might be. So what we end up watching isn't nasty or irrelevant, its heartbreaking.I honestly couldn't help but be appalled by this movie. I didn't want to be, i don't want to be the killjoy. i saw nothing in this movie that justified its 2hrs 20minute runtime and I'm a person that likes to try and take positives out of negatives. I think that the vast majority that will see this movie will be looking for the torture porn elements or just because they heard how 'bad' it is and for that, they will enjoy it. Those who, like me, were looking for something with abit more meat (forgive the pun), something a little more in the vein of A Bittersweet Life, Oldboy or The Chaser, i would strongly recommend staying away from this tripe.",I Saw the Devil
188,glock38_110,"An enjoyable film, if a little on the shallow side.",6,2 March 2011,"Having just watched an excellent Korean thriller (Memories of Murder), I had high hopes for this film. It follows a top secret agent who hunts down and tortures a sadistic killer who murdered the agent's wife. He wants to deliver the ultimate revenge, even it means becoming a monster himself. After this fairly simple plot is established about an hour in, the film then tries to bang it into your head for the rest of the running time with endless scenes of violence, rape and torture. So much so that I was bored with it by the end. The two main characters were flat and one dimensional, nothing about them was explored so instead of actual depth and interesting characters, we're left with an ultimately shallow revenge flick that doesn't really do anything to set itself apart (besides the profound, mindless violence). On a more superficial level, I can't say the film wasn't entertaining, visually it looked great, was well acted for the most part and the action was extremely well directed. That's as far as my admiration for the film went though which is a shame as the film could have been a lot better had they concentrated less on the violence and more on the writing. If you're a fan of Korean cinema, check it out (although I'm sure there are much better films to choose from). Otherwise, you'd probably be better opting for something like Old Boy or Kill Bill instead.",I Saw the Devil

It's not because it's disgusting (Taxidermia is also disgusting but it is a great movie) nor because it's too violent (there are so many good, yet violent movies around), but probably because it has no artistic element in it and the plot is so ridiculously plain and simple that it is almost an insult to the viewer's intelligence.I cannot state the much I got disappointed in this Jee-woon Kim film, considering he is the same director of one of my favourite of all times, Janghwa, Hongryeon, which is a masterpiece, nor the much my heart ached to see Min-sik Choi, who I consider to be a great actor, to play such a silly role that seemed to be conceived to sound like the Coen Brothers.Not good at all - actually that's the Korean film that I liked less so far - and I sincerely hope I'll be able to praise next Jee-woon Kim's movie, because he certainly can do much better than this.",I Saw the Devil

Her fiancée, Intelligence Agent Soo-Hyun, sings Happy Birthday to her on the phone, as she waits. Soo has to run as people begin filing into the conference room, as Joo- yun (Soo's Fiancée) hangs up there is a tap at her window, an offer of help. She politely tells the kindly stranger no thank you, but it seems he had something far more devious planned than helping. Violently ripping her from the car, he drags her unconscious to his, and next we see she is naked, bound, pleading for her life as he prepares to hack her to bits. Putting the pieces in place for one of the most intense, epic revenge driven stories I have ever watched. It turns out not only is her Fiancée an Intelligence Agent, but her father is a Squad Chief, and they both want vengeance in its truest form! Soo receives a file, from his almost father in law, that shows the top four suspects, all of them violent offenders. Soo begins to track and question each one until he finds the evidence needed to be sure who the killer is. Thus begins a cat and mouse game that is really almost indescribable, epic in acts, characters, and finally conclusion!There are numerous moments of brutality that will make you want to almost pull away, but the story is so well written and tightly put together you cant stop watching.The pace of the film is perfection, generally in a film of this length at some point you are going to be longing for the end, but not once was I waiting for the finish. I was completely hooked into the characters, and their struggle against one another. Its engrossing on every level! The violence is just as driving as the story, and comes in these grand waves that are so disgustingly realistic that they are literally painful to watch, but so well balanced that they don't overwhelm the story at all, and just brilliantly executed. We watch as Soo becomes more and more like the man he is hunting, spiraling through this dark slippery emotional blackness that is sorrow, guilt and self loathing, while never loosing focus on his supreme goal no matter the cost.This is just an absolute MUST WATCH film. Granted its a bit of an investment time wise, but it is so beyond worth it.

198,ivan-caldarevic,Revenge is a dish best served cold!,9,23 May 2011,"Well where to startAnother exquisite piece of cinematography from Asia, once again proving that Asians can make more than horror movies. Story starts in wonderful winter night, relaxing and easy, but with well know feeling which accompany you from the beginning saying: ""Something will go wrong in here"". With rather long runtime of 141 minutes, I expected the story which will unwrap slowly, with action now and then, and plenty of scenes ""important for the story"". Because of that I ignored that ""well known feeling"", story and wonderful winterish night tucked me in and I prepared for the long and rather slow movie. I was so wrong! After only few minutes the ""well known feeling"" just takes you and harshly plucks you out of the condition you fell into. And I really mean after few minutes! Something starts to happen, the story starts to build, and from that point on the journey begins and holds you for whole 135 minutes of the movie left! All the time there is something new, some action, something that holds you tense and in expectation what will happen next. I started asking myself ""Why he didn't do that instead of that?"" and similar questions . Main topic of the movie is almost traditional for Asian cinematography – revenge!The movie is enhanced with PERFECT soundtrack in the background which really raises the overall atmosphere, and just fits the situations and atmosphere. Honestly I haven't heard such a good soundtrack long, long time! It is really on the world-class level.I deliberately didn't mention Mr. Min-Sik Choi, who should be renamed only for this movie into Mean-Sick Choi! What a performance! He impersonated a cruel psychopath so flawlessly, this role really fits his face and physical appearance. Well done! I would even say – better that Oldboy. You should expect a great movie which will make you think: ""What would I do in that situation? Is it possible that wrong can be right in some situations?"". This movie is a must for everyone who knows and respects the value of Asian cinematography.

To be frank, there is no suspense in tracking down who the actual killer is. However, the film revolves around how a family guy turns into a monster and competes with another monster. It is like predator Vs alien story. But I am totally in fan of the movie for certain reasons. First, they should have made the identity of the killer at least suspenseful for some time. If not, they should have made the identity of the killer unknown making the chance thrilling. Next, there is no need for unnecessary chasing and killing in the later part, which is just pure cinematic. In fact, they should have made the film short like 90 minutes, and made the story line thrilling. Finally, theatrics in the final science, which again is unnecessary in a movie where the script is Monster Vs Evil. It should have been more like Taken climax.

As in, has a cell phone to sit calmly & passively talking to the protagonist while this creepy guy is bugging her - but doesn't think to call the police or anyone else when creepy guy doesn't leave. She doesn't hear, see or sense him going behind the car or getting his weapons although she's in the middle of nowhere, with no apparent sound or movement of any kind. I mean, I was yelling 'Cell phone!' at least twice as I watched the first in a 2- hour stream of passive/witless victims who supposedly live in a curiously underpopulated modern age (no one else is ever around when these things happen). One of the most hard-to-believe set-ups was a doctor's office with one assistant, no other patients, no other doctors... I don't mind - and am probably unhealthily addicted to - thrill rides, through various genres including 'thriller' & 'horror,' along with films documenting real-life horror. But there has to be a strong central point of interest/engagement ( a cause; one or more characters, a history lesson) for me to suspend disbelief through even half of Hoon-Jung's strange plot turns, which often feel as clumsy & amateurish as those in a student film. There was no character depth or development. The serial killer is completely creepy/un-charismatic, making it unlikely he drove for a school or was able to get close to his victims. The protagonist is fabulously handsome but very wooden in his acting, which isn't helped by the lack of expository dialogue. I ended up giving up in disgust by the cannibalism scene, angry I'd wasted any time on this tripe. Violent scenes - especially so many toward women & others weaker than the killer - should not be wasted on a film that serves no purpose - not scary, not funny, not making any sort of point other than the overdone, obvious one cited by many reviewers, that revenge is a mess.

213,oagawin,Beyond Revenge,9,22 January 2015,"Director Kim Ji-woon's I SAW THE DEVIL (2011) is a psychological thriller that weaves a disturbing theme on violence and revenge, that it eventually passes as a horror film. Using vengeance as it's core, its characters go beyond the limit of imaginable violence, and presents a dreadful realisation that getting one's payback is already a tragedy in itself. Ji- woon carefully handles each scene, however violent, and masterfully executes his characters' emotions for the screen. Byung-hyun as the vengeful Dae-hoon, depicts a strong character of subtle violence overpowered by his hunger for payback. Min-sik's psychotic Kyung-chul, on the other, with his unapologetic, killer-mania stance, tops our ranks of villains in the serial killer genre.At face value, I SAW THE DEVIL is gory, unthinkable, and extremely violent, but at the heart of its core is a much horrifying form of revenge. You may want to think of your worst enemy, while journeying with Dae-hoon as he goes on a cat-and-mouse chase, and silently swear and feel his remorse, and eventual regret.This horror film presents a separatist's perspective to the horror that we know. I SAW THE DEVIL doesn't need white ghosts and long black hairs to give us that run-of-the-mill cinema thrills. It's demons are in the heart of its characters, horrifyingly devouring their souls and transforming their spirits. It's the kind of horror that can believably happen, even to us. Reminiscent of OLDBOY (2003), I SAW THE DEVIL argues that retribution is a fulfilling, yet dangerously self-destructing, cycle; an inevitable price at the end of the journey we wouldn't want to have.",I Saw the Devil

And its not some campy cheesy horror flick, its meant to be a deadly serious drama/thriller which makes the violence stand out even more.But if you can deal with the most extreme levels of gruesome violence imaginable, you might find this enjoyable. Its definitely suspenseful at times. But I do think it goes on much too long (the catch and release thing gets a little ridiculous) and the debilitatingly violent things that happen to certain characters to the point where they should really be in a wheel chair or in traction for weeks or need their skull pieced back together again but are up and about and being violent again shortly after, is just too much to take seriously after a while. Imagine a real serious bloody version of Home Alone where the criminals keep getting hurt by the kids traps only to get back up, moaning and groaning and happen all over again minutes later. Its a little much... and it undermines the hunting aspect of the film which is the long middle portion. The cat and mouse stuff at the end (when the psycho gets the upper hand and the chase is on again) is entertaining and clever but at that point you are just so overwhelmed with the previous 2 hours of dark depraved brutality in repetition, that its hard to truly enjoy it. And the end is a little confusing.Nevertheless, it is definitely thrilling and intense and gripping for a lot of its run. And if you enjoy gore and go into it knowing this is really a drama with a VERY bloody gory movie wrapped inside of it, you might find it worth while.",I Saw the Devil
218,Tysoncarter,An incredible film - simply a must see,10,9 June 2012,"I Saw The Devil is a Korean film about a serial killer who is on the loose and committing some of the most diabolical crimes the police have ever seen. No one is safe as the body count rises and the killer continues his evil odyssey of sadistic butchery. But when the fiancée of an elite special agent becomes one of his victims, a personal investigation becomes a merciless and brutal game of vengeance.The serial killer is played by the superb Choi Min-Sik (Oldboy) and Lee Byung-Hun (A Bittersweet Life) plays the special agent. These 2 actors really push it to the limit and the film excels in every possible way. I Saw The Devil is reminiscent of other serial killer films such as Seven but with a level of violence that far exceeds anything that most directors will make. The violence whilst extreme really adds to the experience. It really is all about showing how far one man will go to get the ultimate revenge.Minor spoilers.Another Korean masterpiece I love is Oldboy, and seeing Oldboy's Choi Min-Sik in I Saw The Devil in a very different role as a serial killer shows just how good an actor he is. He really is a horrible character, and you almost want him to get caught and get tortured due to the things he has done. Rather than just capture the killer, Lee Byung-Hun captures, tortures and then releases him again and again committing the maximum amount of pain possible without killing him as he seeks revenge for his fiancée. And boy does he go to town in the torture stakes. Every time you think the shot is about to cut away as it normally would with a Hollywood produced film it doesn't, and you see everything. Any fellow Asian cinema fans will already know this as films produced in the eastern side of the world don't do toned down violence.Visually it looks superb, featuring some top drawer cinematography and the choreographed fight scenes are incredible, but again this is not surprising given the calibre of the actors and director involved. The subtle soundtrack, the supporting cast, just everything about the film is pretty much perfect. And without giving it away the ending is very satisfying.I cannot recommend this highly enough. It may not be for the faint hearted, but it deserves to be seen. This was the toned down version, the director had to take some violence out just to get it release. Staggering really as I can't picture a more extreme version! However, if you can look past that (or through your fingers at it!) you will be rewarded with an incredible film which gives us a villain as memorable as Hannibal Lecter and an anti-hero special agent who you will root for to get his revenge.For more reviews please visit me at http://headinavice.wordpress.com/",I Saw the Devil

I was sucked into watching this movie by some higher reviews and was disappointed. What on earth seriously! cheap gore scenes, naked women and a stupid detective driving around mindlessly letting this killer guy pile on the bodies, Very smart move! It is so irritating to see the guy get loose again and again to go and affect some more innocent human life. Totally defies the purpose of a revenge when you have actually helped the guy to kill some more innocent people (Yes there were a couple of criminals too but as if he planned it).",I Saw the Devil

Still, the story deserves more respect than a typical horror or action thrill ride, despite its emptiness.

It sends chills to your spine!! The Violence can be unnerving at times but there is nothing done for fun!! It just shows what a psycho serial killer usually does and how when the victim becomes the aggressor the line between right and wrong tends to fade.The premise of the movie of revenge and how a person transforms into the monster himself and stoops to the level of the criminal to inflict the same pain and instill fear in his mind before killing him hits you really hard.
Choi has delivered a performance that I haven't seen till now. His personification of the serial killer is frightening. He turns from composed to insanely violent in one instance and makes you cringe in your seat.
Lee expresses his anguish mostly through the sorrow in his eyes.No Hollywood or any other movie in my mind comes even close to this.A MUST WATCH (again reiterating if you can tolerate some gore and blood)!!!",I Saw the Devil

It's disturbing me because this movie will take you to the darkest places of your mind. Also, just to clarify. This movie is EXTREMELY VIOLENT. As someone who is pretty immune to film violence and desensitised. This made me squirm, and that's a good thing. It means I am not completely desensitised and more importantly it means that violence is horrible. Whether it's a serial killer doing it or a man on a seemingly righteous rampage. So critic complain about the violence? I will tell you why. Because they don't understand it. This isn't 'Kiss the girls'. This is real, the very very scenes are extreme and shows torture of a young lady in graphic ways. Why graphic? Because it's important we feel and understand the revenge of the main protagonist. That my friends makes it more disturbing. Not the violence but the fact that we're now involved in the revenge and you could argue almost complicit. As the revenge gets more and more brutal the director clinically removes us from the revenge aspect and we get more distant about the actions. The lines between right and wrong get blurred. I won't reveal the ending but I can't think of a better ending of a movie. Overall, this movie will become a classic of the serial killer genre. It's what a serial killer movie should be like.

On older man stops to help her out, He is driving a small school bus. While she is waiting for the Towtruck she calls her Fiancée. He tells her to not get out of the vehicle and wait patiently, but the older man has other plans. He smashes her windows and drags her through the snow to his school bus. He takes her to his home where she is tied up. She pleads ""please don't kill me I am pregnant"". A very brutal opening to a movie that becomes relentless in violence. Unfortunately for the Serial Killer, he has chosen poorly in this latest victim. Her father is a retired Police Chief and her Fiancée is a Secret Agent. The Fiancée finds the Serial Killer very easily and then sets out to hunt and track him down. Soon you are not sure which character is the evil one, as lines start to blur. The Fiancée does not only want to just catch the killer, but to play an evil cat and mouse game with him. For he wants him to feel true revenge for what he has done. This Thriller is gory and action packed with characters that you really start to care about. You really get to know the Serial Killer in particular, as he seems to be the main character in the film. He truly is the Devil personified and seems to be the stronger personality of the two characters. The final showdown between the two is brutal and hard to watch.

231,pizza0,Brutally profound,8,15 September 2010,"Just came back from the TIFF 10 screening of the UNCUT version of this film, and after reading the very first review posted here, I feel somewhat compelled to leave a short comment.the movie is about revenge. a woman is murdered by a serial killer, the woman's soon-to-be husband, who happens be a highly trained special agent, takes revenge on the serial killer in some of the most gruesome ways ever presented on film.The ""TAKEN""-esque plot is fairly straight forward and even predictable at times, for some people, this unfortunately exposes the violence and turns it into a dominating theme, hence remarks of it being mindless and unnecessary are brought up.But fans of this genre can easily see past the violence, and be drawn back to the noir nature of the film with each passing violence ""segement"", in the end, you can feel the main character's will for revenge, and that simply transcends the violence, and ultimately turns the film into an imaginative commentary on the human condition.the film would also remind you of classic Fincher films, namely se7en, however, the theatrical construction of plot is a signature Ji Woon Kim style, the mise-en-scene, the soundtrack, you see it in every single film of his, especially bittersweet life.after watching this film I found myself immediately comparing it to another masterpiece sympathy for mr.vengeance, so for those of you who have seen chan wook park's revenge trilogy and loved it, you should find time to see this film.",I Saw the Devil

233,unitythroughterror,Thinking Man's Torture Porn,10,2 June 2014,"This movie is not normally my cup of tea. Sure, I've seen a lot like them - horror and the gore fest to me should not be labeled as the same genre. I prefer psychological horror and paranormal horror movies anyway over gory horror, but this movie still blew my socks off. It's a genuinely unique, thoughtful, and even torridly touching gore fest. After his wife is dismembered while pregnant, a man sets out to avenge her death by torturing her killer to the point of redemption, or of death. The killer (the obvious Devil, although the title is far more complex and open to interpretation) clearly isn't repentant, and so begins a journey through hell. You'll meet weird cannibal siblings, a man whose balls are literally broken, young women with no gumption or sense of empowerment, helpless victims, a female assassin who dies within seconds of her assassination attempt, a man with a barbell rammed through his eye, among others. The only thing that holds this whole gory story together is the flawless execution, while blood soaked, it is still a moving drama while presenting us with some of the most offensive and obscene images I've seen in a while. Some of the things presented here will give Dario Argento a run for his money (and are on par with his film Mother of Tears). I'll give this gobbler a good 10/10 for sheer excellence in execution, and for truly haunting and harrowing themes that will stay with you long after the last, blood-soaked reel has finished.",I Saw the Devil

235,richardmeadfsu,A Woman Breaks Down on the Side of the Road,9,6 November 2017,"Every Halloween, the average movie goer seeks out fun and scary movies to fill their wait for whatever acts of immaturity they will commit that night.But the films they tend to flock to are the Para-nauseating Activities and anything with a bloody pumpkin on the cover of the DVD case. These types of movies have almost systematically gutted (get it?) the horror genre with their insipid take on what they think people are scared of.Jump scares are not scaryso stop it.As you look for a film to re-sensitize your adult self looking for an adult movie to watch this Halloween, don't look any further than Kim Jee-woon's ""I Saw the Devil."" This 2011 Korean-language film sits in the category of crime thrillers, but is less David Fincher (""Zodiac"") and more Mary Harron (""American Psycho""). ""I Saw the Devil"" follows a trained secret agent, played by Byung-hun Lee, as he searches for the psychopathic taxi driver who murdered his fiancé while she was broken down on the side of the road during a winter night.If this sounds as fun to you as it did to me, does that make us bad people? Probably.What ensues is a perfect representation of thriller meets filler, as the film uses immaculate cinematography to present hard-to-watch, bloody confrontations. Each scene is set up beautifully, with the fantastic use of nighttime a noteworthy attribute. Unlike many films where someone walking around in the dead of night has their face perfectly lit for some reason, ""I Saw the Devil"" injects you into the scene as nighttime is actually as dark and foreboding as you would imagine it.The performances are also perfect for the film, with Min-sik Choi (""Old Boy"" — the good one) putting to screen one of the most unsettling antagonists ever. He comes across as the dirtiest person in a very dirty place, with his facial expressions telling you exactly what you need to know about his murderous tendencies. Lee's portrayal is equal parts heartbreaking and enthralling as he flips his entire world upside down to hunt down the one who widowed him.""I Saw the Devil"" is presented whole-heartedly as an unflinching film, not shying away from axing any character at any time. People die, and they die often and in the worst ways, but it never becomes campy or cliché in the slightest. In short, blood is spilled in an honest fashion.It's also much more action packed than most horror films, which is fun without becoming ridiculous. It presents its action in the same manner as ""Old Boy"" does, with fighting tweaked just enough to be stylized without becoming phony.If all of the aforementioned hasn't made it apparent, this is not a film for light of heart or for any child. Like, at all. ""I Saw the Devil"" was released without an MPAA rating, so it's safe to assume if you can't buy cigarettes, you shouldn't watch this movie.But if you can buy Big Tobacco's Taquitos, then please seek out this visceral experience as I did. It's available in almost all rental stores and can even be viewed in full — with English subtitles — on YouTube. On an ending note, this film also has a very well-made trailer. So if you like what the trailer shows, then you will like ""I Saw the Devil.""",I Saw the Devil

The main difference is that the viewer has no investment in the extreme violence that takes place on the screen, because the characters are never developed. In The Chaser, we meet a prostitute with a fever and a kid to look after. She is forced to work, and suffers at the hands of a serial killer for it. We care about her.In I Saw the Devil, we see a woman in a car talking to her fiancé, who is a secret agent (not kidding). She is then murdered. Who is she? We have no idea, but you can imagine that her husband is upset. He will track down the killer, using ANY MEANS NECESSARY, including his own extreme violence. Does this sound familiar? It should--it's a boring adolescent revenge fantasy, and I expected better from the director of A Tale of Two Sisters and The Good, the Bad, and the Weird (which didn't appeal to me so much, but had some flair).Very disappointing.

A good example is if you've seen the revenge trilogy, as most fans of korean cinema have, and thought it was either too violent or dark, this film is much worse. To my surprise the murders are more graphic due to the sexual nature of some of them, which while dealt with in films like memories of murder and the chaser, the sexual side was often off screen and hinted at but in I Saw the Devil though the majority of the violence is off screen, the director shows enough to create a true monster played effortlessly by Choi Min Sik who steals the show as the serial killer. The story is a cat and mouse between the protagonist and the killer, I've already forgotten their names, but never plays out as you'd expect and when the tables turn, the conclusion is as satisfying as it is unpredictable which will no doubt leave a few plot holes on the way. It will have you gripped and is often relentless with the violence but ultimately another excellent example of korean cinema which may be too graphic for it's own good, the majority of the sex and nudity could have been avoided and kept off screen yet it adds to the dark charm of a film that succeeds in being unique in a old genre",I Saw the Devil

There is some pretty fake visual effects, when the protagonist smashes a man's penis it looks very fake, as well as a part towards the end of a man getting his face hit with a object (you'll notice it). I'm not sure why they just didn't the entire face maybe, just a part so the effect won't be as noticeable. There also seems to be a lot of questionable logic, including how the protagonist found the killer. The protagonist found the killer by going to his parents then talking to his son, which he told him the address pretty much right away. How did the police not do that? Clearly the killer was wanted they made a big deal of saying that he's turning himself in. This film follows a lot of stereotypes and cliches of most revenge crime movies, including a scene where a woman sneaks up on the protagonist and yells before trying to stab him which only results in a scratch.I would have rated a 6, which is decent in my book, if it wasn't for the great aspects. Including the incredible performance by Choi min-sik.I rate this a 7/10 which I consider good. It has it's flaws but I believe the great aspects of the film outweighs its flaws",I Saw the Devil
254,julio-m-henriquez,This film is overwhelming! It's violent and passionate altogether.,8,15 June 2011,"This film is overwhelming! It's violent and passionate altogether. Director Kim Ji-woon and writer Hoon-jung Park guide us through a yet simple but intense story in the eyes of a monster and a hero simultaneously. Thrill by thrill, we experience the terrifying fear of a victim of brutal violation, the ""Black Hole"" that is left in the chest of someone who lost what he loves the most, the apathy in the gestures of a butcher that chops human meat and the delicacy with which he prepares his ""working space"" or combs his hair when he is done. This story is cruel in many ways, but also human on its very nature.Now lets talk about the film. To a certain degree this is a vendetta thriller. Vengeance triggered the plot, it's also our hero's motive but true vendetta is difficult to achieve and even worst sometimes, useless. And therein lies the key.Our hero is Kim Soo-Hyeon (Lee Byung-hun), a secret agent whose path is crossed with the incredibly sick, psychopathic serial killer Kyung-chul (Min-sik Choi) when this offered to help the beautiful Ju-yeon (San-ha oh), on a desolated street, when her tires broke down. Then suddenly attacks her and (possibly) rapes her. ""Don't kill me, please"", She says. ""Why?"", he asks. ""I'm carrying a baby"", his knife goes down. Needless to say, this is the pregnant fiancée of Kim Soo-Hyeon. ""I'm sorry Ju-yeon, I couldn't keep the promise. I was late and couldn't keep the promise. But Ju-yeon, I'll promise this: I'll give him pain that's a thousand times—no—ten thousand times worse.""This pretty much describes his intentions and basically the rest of the film. I couldn't say much about it without taking away part of the fun. But I'm only gonna say this : Kim Soo-Hyeon has the motives, the tools, the training and the experience to go in his endeavour. He doesn't wanna kill him, at least not immediately, so he starts some sort of catching and freeing game with Kyung-chul. Giving him more pain every time, loosing more and more of his humanity in the way.About the violence on this film, some people ware very shocked with it. Even comparing it to Hostel, something I considered a little excessive. I'm only going to say it was essential to complete the picture. It was a fundamental part of the imagery, necessary so we can see how determined our characters ware.I really loved this movie, I was able to identify myself with every character on it. The acting from Min-sik Choi is simply incredible. He undertakes his role in a way that only an experience actor could. I still haven't seen any other film from director Kim Ji-woom, but his past works had been received very pleasantly by the audiences, and this one is no different. What I like the most is he makes the characters look like real people. Some of them feel, some don't feel anything at all. And thats why this film works, people can really be like this. Sick people, maybe but people at the end.",I Saw the Devil

My view its best not to over read the story line and just watch it! I will say one thing. This film has found a place inside my head and thats always a sign of a good movie. Why was has this movie Jammed inside my head? Well maybe thats down to 1 of 3 reasons. 1st being the brutal violence. (Alot of talk over this but to be fair i think hostel and the Saw series are worse and is put in simply for shock value, i didn't really feel that here) 2nd because of the unique story and the way it was wonderfully captured 3rd. Because of the acting. Answer? well I have to say its all three. All the actors play there part but its Min –Sik –Choi from the excellent ""Old boy"" who steals the show here he is simply immense here. One of the greatest screen villains portrayed on film. He is perverted, depraved and simply never knows defeat. He is a joy to watch if you can stomach him. However it is not without its faults. For example people seem to keep surviving horrific beatings to the head that would kill rocky. But who cares, just leave your dinner till after the movie, sit back and enjoy the ride.

The catch-and-release type of revenge makes this an interesting and different approach. It's very gory and brutal but I also found myself laughing at certain parts. Some of the things that happen are ridiculous and hilarious.This isn't a horror film or even a thriller, I would say more of a Crime/Action/Drama. The subtitles are easy to read and it's a very stylish South Korean film. The director/writer Jee-woon Kim obviously has a warped mind. Choi Min-sik absolutely nails his part as the stone cold murderer. He was brooding and just didn't give a F00k about anything or anyone. Definitely the standout performance. His friend who is also a killer and a cannibal made it even more funny by their outlandish banter.This is definitely a must watch for any crime buff or gore hound.",I Saw the Devil
258,chrisfoster99,45 minutes too long. Overly dramatic. Plot holes abound.,4,29 April 2020,"The film is visually satisfying. The use of colours is pleasing and scenes are well - if overtly - lit.The dialogue is melodramatic and this and the acting become more so as the film progresses.However, there is little horror or suspense here. As each set piece opens, it is fairly obvious what will happen and the running time of the film is a give away as each plot point unfolds. The film feels like a vehicle for Lee Byung-hun as much as a film in its own right.I feel the film would have benefited from better editing. By the final half hour we felt we had to continue watching just to see if it ended as we thought it would at the start.Spoorloos (The Vanishing, 1988) did this so much better and for a quality Korean thriller with none of the melodrama and vehicle like qualities, I recommend The Wailing (2016).",I Saw the Devil
259,nti_darren,Well done movie undone by enraging ending,6,5 March 2021,"To put this review simply; ""He got off too GD-mned easy"". The bad guy in this movie didn't suffer NEARLY enough to make it worth it.Right from the get go in this movie, you already basically have one of the most evil characters in movie history. Makes Hannibal lecter seem charming and friendly by comparison. The villain in this movie is maybe the biggest scumbag in movie history? Safe bet he's in the top 10. So boiling this guy alive in acid still wont keep you satisfied.And you are already wanted that fate for him, after the intro of the movie. But the last 20 mins really did this movie in. Did they really have to go there with the other daughter as well? Pushed it past the point of no return. Now boiling in acid isn't good enough , and this guy will never be able to feel enough pain. They scumbag partner of his in the hospital even implies he rapes them before killing them (which we already kinda knew based on the kidnapping scene at the greenhouse). So the evil this villain has done can never really be equalized by ""revenge"" in this movie. The bad stuff just goes too far.On top of that, he even admits in the end, that he's not really scared, or remorseful or feels any pain. He did in fact, as he states , win. And his final exit? Quite possibly the fastest and easiest way to die known to man.Super depressing movie. Already almost impossilbe to be happy with ANYTHING this guy could suffer ..and becomes impossible after the 2nd daughter thing.Acting, direction, villainous scumbag: A

FDo you want to see a good revenge movie where the protagonist gets major revenge, without the main characters suffering beyond the point where too much damage is done?

263,thebathroomsinger,A question to Kim: All this trouble...! Why??,3,14 November 2012,"Revenge.. is an easy theme for one to work with and to weave a thrilling story around and Jee-woon Kim makes a confusing contribution with this film - even the name in English makes no sense if u look back! And look back I do with a lot of disappointment at having been led on by the high rating on IMDb! What is wrong with the film-viewing community these days that they give high ratings to any pretentious junk that comes their way?This film is not the least bit realistic in any way in terms of the situations and the incidents.. it is just too surreal while it attempts to be anything but that! Like just how does the good guy with the pin- up-guy face and boy-band-crew haircut get away so easily from the cops AND the bad guys! And going by the ease with which the 'bad guy' does away with humans, one would think that living in Korea is really dangerous - and young girls dressed in expensive-looking clothes wouldn't wanna be caught dead waiting for a bus in the middle of nowhere - especially after dark! Its like the script-writer sat with a bunch of his drunk friends discussing women and they went, ""..yeah, let's put this girl here in this scene, strip her naked, and then another girl here, get her molested, and another one there and get her raped! Yeah, that's the secret to attracting a large audience!"" So at regular intervals - what could have been hinted at, was explicitly displayed, in not anywhere near artistic shots. Purely gross stuff shown to gross u out.. without any emotion involved at all!Very lackluster performances too.. bah! None of the actors in this film seem really fit for their role and instead look very uncomfortable playing their part and eager to finish the job and move on! So i'll not waste any more of my (nor your) time with this film and would like to make this review brief, in concluding that besides the casting and the plot, there were just too many flaws in this film in dealing with psychology, physiology, etc. Cheap thrills in shock- sequences and an overly-cold cold-blooded 'bad guy' who is thrown into pointless gory scenes make this film a senseless ordeal!3 out of 10 for the not-so-terrible music and the bare effort taken by Kim to make this film a 'thriller' with OK cinematography (A tale of 2 sisters - also by Kim - had better visuals).

266,nerdy88,Not a good movie,1,11 December 2010,"I can't remember ever being put off by violence and gore in a movie. Irreversible came close, but its virtues were always greater than the violent scenes. That movie was far more disturbing than this one, but was helped by a director with an actual vision and an interesting story to tell. I even think that, when done right, violence can lift a movie up. I love Peckinpah, Scorsese, Kubrick and even Miike.Now here is a movie that is totally ruined by the sheer violence of some scenes. The film itself has a standard, Hollywood-type serial killer story and is shot in a very slick way. Without the exaggerated gore, the film would be quite fun, with the violence in it it becomes silly and sickening. The movie has an extremely unrealistic plot and its direction is slick and (litterally) beautiful. The only aspects of the movie which were raw and realistic, were the gore/murder scenes.. Problem is that the movie's violent scenes are in no way connected to the overall movie. Why did the director make the violence so extremely raw and realistic in a movie which was neither? For me it means that the filmmakers were only interested in out-goring violent movies of the past. The ultra extreme violence simply has no purpose, other than to make the film appealing to certain types of audiences: without the violence there wouldn't be much to talk about.I really hate this movie. I love Miike and movies like Oldboy and The Chaser (the latter being the movie this one wanted to be), but here the filmmakers ended up making a gore porn movie. A movie with no really interesting aspects, other than the tittilating scenes.

Of course the gore, why and how is still relevant. We are engaged in wanting to know why the murder is doing what he is doing we are interested in his background and what he is gonna do next. The start is very much interesting as to how the protagonist is going to go about this and the end with an absolute twist that is a possibility but not one that anybody would wish for.

But enough of that .Back to the movie.The movie is well-done build .If you're expecting any Hollywood predictable scenes , you're gonna be surprised . The way that the movie was filmed brings a thrill to all the newcomers in Korean cinematography .The viewer has a lot of close-ups with the main characters as well as the fight between them .

He's symbolizing Vengeance,Vengeance taken to extreme .His Will to keep his promise and destroy his wife's assassin is bigger than his will to live and protect the ones he love .A fatal mistake which will be his tombstone .His lack of emotions is showing that he changed .He lost everything : his wife , his life and even more .You may think he lost his human part , but you'll have a surprise in the end .

285,travisk-11-189335,An eye for an eye is just the beginning...,8,27 March 2011,"I SAW THE DEVIL begins by taking the viewer on a snowy winter drive down an isolated rural road. The driver is an attractive, young woman. That woman happens to be the daughter of the police chief and the wife of secret agent Kim Soo-hyeon, played by Byung-hun Lee.Kyung-Chul is played by Min-sik Choi, best known here by his unforgettable performance as Dae-su Oh in OLDBOY. Choi is cinematically magnetic, an on screen presence similar to what Roy Orbison did for music not very pretty to look at, but his talent more than makes up for his lack of the typical star look. Choi displays one of the most convincingly evil and intelligent characters since Anthony Hopkins first dawned the Hannibal Lector mythos. Choi's appearance in I SAW THE DEVIL may best be described as a stockier, Korean Benicio del Toro, the actor whom I would cast in the American remake, if I were willing to support such a thing which I do not.Yes, the violence is graphic, difficult to watch in places, but its not gory so much as being unflinchingly realistic and brutal. Many filmmakers would choose to cutaway just before impact, or to imply the severity of the torture, but Jee-woon Kim refuses to skirt around the reality of violence. This makes many of us uncomfortable, which is actually the point.I SAW THE DEVIL combines the calculated suspense of Alfred Hitchcock with the gritty appeal of the film noir. The story does not succumb to the shallow notion of a purely good hero and a purely evil villain, instead showing both sides of both men. In the end, revenge is served, but not without great cost to both men.

Becomes too unbelievable and women victims are unrealistically helpless.,6,5 August 2021,"I really enjoyed this when it was first released. 11 years later, not so much.The highlights of this movie remain the acting, Choi Min-sik is just brilliant and evil and his presence overshadows the protagonist. The score complements the scenes very well, even during jump scares. Technical qualities such as the makeup, gore, and locations are also great.However, the script has serious problems. The protagonist is Bruce Lee powerful when convenient, but for unexplained reasons he delays intervening repeatedly. So, women victims are first subjected to harm and violence for his delays and then the camera work gets problematic when this happens multiple times. Also, a ridiculous and unbelievable coincidence occurs in the middle of the movie with a taxi that would make its own entertaining short film. Finally, the ending makes no sense since the only people hurt are innocent victims.Overall, this is worth watching because there are moments throughout the movie that entertain.",I Saw the Devil

I love revenge flicks and this one has the usual set-up killer murders a mans wife the man goes to the ends of the earth to avenge the murder. But from the get-go you realize this is going to be done with style and hard violence lots of it. The opening scene at the side of the road puts you in a state of tension and from there on the film never lets you go. One of the best parts of the film is how far our hero will go to get revenge. He's not out for an eye for and eye, he's out to punish the killer, over and over and as much as he can. He's out for and eye for an eye and arm and a few legs. This a film with no humor and no sunshine, happy moments are nil, but isn't that the best way to make a film like this? Korean cinema does it again.",I Saw the Devil

I wanted to give 8 stars for great actor and plot but the main character acted by Lee Byung-Hun is just NOT very smart.

But this is a must watch like the original oldboy, train to Busan, parasite are some of the more known Korean movies but believe me there's a lot of great movies from Korea (South Korea)",I Saw the Devil
292,masoperez,A gore-fest that showed a lot of promise but ultimately floundered due to its lack of character and realism.,6,31 May 2018,"I had heard this was a film to rival Park Chan-wook's ""Oldboy""-and to some it might, as I'm aware many did not enjoy Oldboy as much as I did-but in all honesty I found it wanting in substance and gruelling in pace. It's a superficial and unsubstantial horror film that mainly sticks in the mind due to disturbing content, not disturbing themes.SPOILERS WILL BE INCLUDED BEYOND THIS POINTLet's handle each aspect of film itself to break down what I feel didn't work about the film:First, our Protagonist, Agent Soo-hyeon. What can be said about him other than his occupation and relationship with the victim? Well, very little. He is given a bit of extra characterization with a more vulnerable side at the beginning phone call, but after that point he becomes singular in his goals and shows next-to-no personality besides hesitance and blood lust. This would be fine if his plan made any sense. Don't get me wrong, I understand the concept of catch-and-release torture and why he might pick it, but not only does it immediately make him into an unlikable character, subjecting multiple women to horrifying conditions because he was continuously sloppy with his surveillance of his target. But also a lot of his choices are not only medically impossible to sustain (like constant knock-outs actually leading to brain damage) but also he makes ridiculous action-movie level choices that make the movie seem like a cartoon. The final death scene for the villain also seems hilariously out of theme, with him inflicting horror on the villain's family...a family the villain doesn't even care about.Speaking of Kyung-chul, he was mostly fine. See, in the movies there's always an ongoing attempt to explain a serial killer's reasoning or to make them refined/attractive to make them more horrifying. However, reading the real cases of killers reveals the vast majority of them are brutal simpletons who commit horrible crimes for no reason besides they can. I respected the decision to make Kyung-chul more in line with this type of thinking, but he's ruined in the final scene by trying to make him care about a family he outright abandoned to become a serial killer. It's very confusing.When it comes to the plot itself, it's structured well but is bogged down by ridiculously unbelievable set pieces and repetitive actions. The only thing to keep up continuous engagement is the shock value of the gore, which doesn't affect me personally all that much. The structure is mostly good but the choices of some characters (mainly our inconsistent protagonist) are too stupid to feel justifiable. All-in-all I was thoroughly disappointed.",I Saw the Devil

296,balefulregards,I expected Better,6,13 May 2011,"I was deeply disappointed. Without having to go blow for blow with others who have reviewed this film, all I can say is that the story was no where near as original as others I have seen ( and loved). Even the Chaser was more original in its story arc. As far as acting, after my love of his performance in OldBoy, I expected More from Choi. But is this the fault of the actors? I doubt it. The story line was so thin and derivative that I could practically predict the lines before they were said. (Um, Handphone anyone?) I found the characters to be undeveloped and even cartoonish in their reactions and dialogue.The gore and sex scenes were needlessly long and drawn out. I actually ended up apologizing to my husband for this as my choice for movie night. I realize that others may love this, and I ""got"" where the story was going...I just think they could have told a Far more compelling story if they fine tuned the story rather than finding new ways to showcase blood spurting or ways to rape women or dismember them.Go Watch Old Boy again rather than invest the 2.5 hours in this film.",I Saw the Devil
297,mason-dredge,"Never Have Rape, Mutilation, and Serial Killers Been More Beautiful",7,7 July 2014,"I Saw The Devil is one of the strangest movies I've ever seen. Even though it has some of the most disturbing, hard to watch, sadistic, and sometimes outright disgusting sequences of violence in any movie I've ever seen I couldn't help but keep my eyes glued to the screen for it's entire run time because of how beautifully and masterfully the whole film was shot. The plot for this one is simple. When a secret service agent's fiancé is brutally murdered by serial killer, he makes it his personal mission to track down the punish the man who did it and along the way, his shocked at far he will sink to deliver that punishment. The films central characters, the secret service agent and the serial killer, are both very interesting and serve as great focal points for the film's main question which is what's the difference between us and the worst part of humanity. The acting is great with Min-sik Choi making my skin crawl every time he was on screen as the film's villain. The movie, as I said before, is beautifully shot with a lot of dark, atmospheric shots underscored by the films very basic but effective soundtrack. The films only downsides are that is does drag from time to time and some of the moments early one dealing with the secret service agent's grief felt a little hooky and underdone to me. Besides that, I Saw The Devil is a solid, beautifully crafted film with a deep message that is just dripping with entertainment value....as long as you can get past the brutal, gut-wrenching violence of the film.",I Saw the Devil
298,Barkha,"a movie to endure, not enjoy",3,9 May 2011,"A Bittersweet Life is one of my favorite films of all time and The Good The Bad and The Weird is one of the funnest, coolest looking movies ever so I scoffed when I heard this film referred to as ""torture porn,"" thinking someone is probably just not used to Korean violence.But I think torture porn pretty much sums it up. Yes it is beautifully filmed, yes there are amazing, imaginative set piece fight/car chase scenes. But where is the humor, where is the humanity of the director's previous films?If the point is supposed to be that vengeance turns you into the kind of beast you are avenging, the point gets pounded into you, and not in the interesting/challenging way it was in The Vengeance Trilogy, but in a tedious and extremely unpleasant way.I love Byung-hun Lee, but every other man in this movies was offensively ugly to have to watch and every woman was a plot device, not a character.

The cinematography is haunting, the action is hypnotic and the murders are savage and unrelenting.
The throbbing score works harmoniously through every scene.
As the violence escalates, the lines become blurred on who the real devil of the piece is. While one might argue that the extremes of both violence and bloodshed serve to cheapen and degrade this Jee-Woon Kim film, I have to disagree. The movie deals with a dark subject matter unflinchingly with little compromise. It is never exploitative or disingenuous. It is, at times, hard to watch, but it is certainly worth the trouble.
I Saw The Devil will implore you to evaluate your own moral compass.",I Saw the Devil
301,orchard6,Revenge done right,10,5 March 2014,"Kim Jee-Woon's 2010 film I Saw the Devil, is a relentlessly ultra-violent tale of revenge. A look into just how far a man is willing to go to hurt someone who has hurt him. South Korea seems to have an infatuation with revenge films (The Chaser, The Vengeance Trilogy, Bittersweet Life) but that's fine by the rest of the world because they do them right.I Saw the Devil's plot revolves around secret agent Kim Soo-hyeon (Byung-hun Lee), whose wife's life is taken by a deranged serial killer Kyung-chul (Min-sik Choi). Kim Soo-hyeon and Kyung-chul play a sort of cat and mouse game throughout the film, as it is Kim's plan to instill fear through constant unexpected violent attacks.Overall, everything about this film is done well and with precision. The fight scenes are realistic and gritty, the characters are interesting, and the plot will most certainly keep you hooked. If there is one thing that Korean cinema does correctly, it's revenge-based thrillers.The most brutal part of I Saw the Devil is the harrowing reality in which each death is depicted. These are not flashy Hollywood film deaths. These are people getting killed in cold-blood by a man who lacks all empathy. There is no motive to his killings and it brings to light the fact that a small percent of our fellow man can be capable of evil rivaling the most prolific horror movie antagonists.",I Saw the Devil

You will never see another thriller without thinking back to this one. There is some beautiful scenery that makes you just shake your head with what is going on. That could be deliberate. I thought sometimes that with tragedy there is always something that pulls you away from the stark reality of what you are seeing. This film is full of that. Occasionally unbelievable and then totally believable. I will always suggest to people, see this film first. You may save yourself hours of watching unnecessary others. It's hard to stomach at times but throughout you know that you are watching something that will never be done again so well. At least not for a while.",I Saw the Devil
304,sinssmo,"I saw the devil, and it was not pretty",7,1 May 2018,"A dark and violent fast-paced Korean thriller, I saw the devil does not compromise. Violence is graphic, and there's not much left to imagination: chasing a serial killer is not meant to be subtle.
The scenario revolves around a brilliant idea, going down the path of a serial killer for revenge. Nothing elaborate there, though the few twists come at good time and serve the global uneasiness of the movie.
Dialogues are not especially deep or subtle, but they match the atmosphere of the movie. Which is what really shines here. The constant tension, with peaks of mental pain in front of harsh torture scenes, while you watch the everlasting downfall of the vigilante towards the path of evil. The photography serves also the same purpose of instilling this queasy feeling inside of you, with a brilliant mix of absolute beauty and profound horror. Some plans are a sight to see.
Overall a great movie, well-served by a unique atmosphere. Second-role actors sometimes hinder the full bloom of this movie, but this remains a must-see.",I Saw the Devil

Even though this movie has some gnarly scenes that will make you cringe, it's not even close to the violence in ISOYG. Good or bad, you decide. What you get instead is a classic revenge movie with a twist. The actors and especially the villain, are played very well.Story is interesting but it has one major flaw. It's waaaaay too long. At a running time of 141 minutes, it's about 45 minutes too long. Considering the outline, you want to keep the storytelling tight...which it is not. Character development is kept to a minimum. You have no idea what drives the the villain and why he chops up women. What drives our hero is pretty obvious but we have no idea what he does in the real world except being in the intelligence service. Is he a bodyguard, is he an assassin? Other than that it's a good movie. If the movie had been shorter I would have given it a 8. Now it's a 6.",I Saw the Devil
308,sakimura_chan,Another great psychological thriller from South Korea.,9,17 July 2014,"Some minor spoilers, mostly vague.Like Oldboy, The Chaser, and The Man From Nowhere, I Saw the Devil is exciting and action-packed, as a thriller should be. It is sometimes disturbing, sometimes almost humorous, and it will give you plenty of situations with which to feel satisfied seeing justice be done (in some form). The emotional parts of the movie are a bit down-played and not as dramatic as some other movies in the genre, but the gut-twisting sympathy for the struggles of the main character is the same. I Saw the Devil is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen, definitely one of the most fun ones. The ending may leave something to be desired for some viewers. Even after seeing it several times, I still don't know exactly how I feel about it.The fighting scenes are perfect. The actors chosen for the main roles were spot-on. Choi Min-Sik in particular makes a very convincing and creepy villain with a darker vibe and more imposing attitude than his performance in Oldboy. Finally, it was immensely gratifying to watch a psychological thriller that has moments both of frustration AND satisfaction, rather than more of one or the other.That said, the supporting characters were a bit weak (not in acting, but in their involvement with the plot). The movie also suffers from some of the same annoying pitfalls as so many other thrillers, especially from lack of realism in certain circumstances.For these reasons, I rated the movie 9/10. I would highly recommend this movie, especially to those who liked other South Korean thrillers.",I Saw the Devil
309,dkeller522-242-31684,Hold on tight. This is one hell of a ride,10,4 June 2015,"So I had heard a lot of praise for this movie before finally sitting down to watch it, praise to the point where I had become worried that no matter what happened this movie could never live up to the 5 years of hype I have heard. I was wrong in the best possible way. From it's brutal and exceptionally uncomfortable opening to the long exhale you're finally allowed to take 140 minutes later when the film comes to it's end I Saw the Devil has made itself the standard bearer for revenge thrillers. The filmmakers here know that the central plot line of husband seeking revenge for murdered wife isn't exactly new territory and instead of trying reinvent the genre they just made the best and most extreme version of it, much the way Funny Games did with the home invasion genre. What made Funny Games so memorable was the fact that it punished it's viewers, giving them the violence they were expecting but in such a brutal manner that that it struck a nerve even with those that considered themselves desensitized and I Saw the Devil does the same thing. You know you want revenge, you want to see the husband strike back against this vicious killer, but to what length? How deep into the rabbit hole are we going to encourage our protagonist to go? These are the questions forced on us once the film proceeds past the greenhouse sequence. Thankfully our villain never relents or gives us reason for sympathies, he's as unflinching and imposing as Bardem in No Country For Old Men. Overall this film is probably one of the easiest 10/10 ratings I've ever given, it's both brutal and beautiful, and while ultra violent it never feels forced or unnecessary.

The fact that the dead of the family-in-law wasn't clear and the emotional hit from that never came from me because i thought that the still have his father-in-law, at my first viewing i thought that the father survive, nothing indicate that he was dead, the little sister i kinda suspect that but nothing came oficial, until my 4 viewing and i look it up that time.",I Saw the Devil

I saw the devil is just another stupid slasher.I m not too sure what the director's intention is, and i'd be curious to hear what he has to say - but I suspect it is a big joke. When you compare I saw the devil to Park Chan Wook's work or to the Chaser there is no comparison possible.

It wasn't a snoozer since it has plenty of gory action scenes but it could have been better if they tried to build the characters' histories a little bit than putting in more violence in this movie.The role of the protagonist in this movie is stupid. Why would he let the antagonist who is a dangerous criminal, run around again freely every after he tortures him thus killing more innocent people? Why don't he just tie him up and then torture him until he is satisfied with his revenge for his fiancé? Due to the movie's lack of focus on the character's background, one would not know the reason why this killer abducts, kills and butchers women. And why women? Give this movie a try if your a fanatic of this type of genre. The lighting is great as well as the overall ambiance of the film as it adds more intensity at every scene. It's worth watching with your friends as there really are lots of ""cover my eyes"" and ""OMG that hurts"" scene here so I believe you would still enjoy it even though it fell short on some aspects.",I Saw the Devil
322,PeterRoeder36,What a crock of nonsense,6,28 January 2013,"It's an OK movie there was just some things I really disliked about it *spoiler alert* which was the investigation. There are just no clues. How does he find the murderer? No clues. Moreover, how does he follow the killer around? If he had some tracking device on him he could simply remove it. Where is the tracking device? Other than that, I think it's pretty good. A bit long but that's the point because he takes revenge again and again. Moreover, it's obvious that this movie is sort of like trying to portray a Ted Bundy type of serial killer and it does a pretty good job although I think some of it is a bit unrealistic and the victims would have fought more back. It seems a bit silly. Anyway, if you like perverted movies like a Serbian Film and stuff you will really like this one.",I Saw the Devil
323,marklechmancem,"Finally a suitable heir to the classic ""Ichi the Killer""",9,2 January 2018,"""I Saw The Devil"" was a return to the Asian revenge niche for me after being disappointed by my last few incursions into the genre. To be honest I was thrilled the first times I saw classics like Ichi, Oldboy and Sympathy for Mr Vengeance but got bored after seeing too much of the same stuff all the time.This feature by Jee-woon Kim inserts itself into the heritage of previous films of the Revenge niche all the while making a place of its own with a different take on the whole classic dynamic of guy gets wronged, guy vows to avenge lost one, guy finds villain henchmen and beats them up one by one until he gets bloody fight with big bad guy in the end.Without spoiling anyone let's just say the sadistic psychopath in this movie really did mess with the wrong guy when he chose 
young Kim Soo-hyeon's girlfriend to quench his violent fantasies.I gotta admit the whole premise felt a little dreamy faky but things pick up after half an hour.

333,jinhoo7653,I dislike this movie.,6,28 May 2011,"I usually don't write reviews on movies, but I felt compelled to write a thing or two about this movie that I disliked immensely. I honestly am having very hard time trying to understand why this movie got such a high rating in IMDb. First off, The story was very boring and predictable, and protagonist was probably one of the most despicable character I've seen in a revenge flick. It can probably be argued that he has probably done more damage than the serial killer through all the suffering he caused for innocent people. He appeared to show zero remorse for all the trauma he caused innocent victims by letting the killer go every time and seemed to enjoy the suffering he caused around him. At least for me, he had zero redeeming quality and made me want to root for the psycho killer (which I assume was not the director's intention). Further, Lee byung hun's lack of emotional range can be clearly seen in many crucial scenes as his acting definitely feels forced from the beginning to the end, and there is absolutely no character development for both the protagonist and the killer which I found very disappointing. They were simply one dimensional characters most frequently seen in Hollywood movies. Lee byung hun's dialogue seemed forced at times, and I could not feel a single genuine emotion coming from him in any of the scene. Not only that, the plot of this movie simply baffled me. Kim Soo Hyeon(Lee byung hun's character) makes many (and I mean many) illogical decisions in the movie. After he let Kyung-chul go for the last time, why would he go to the hospital to ask his brother(?) what Kyung-chul is up to. I would have to assume that he has to be intellectually compromised to not see where this is headed. Kyung-chul pretty much gives it away by saying that he will get his revenge, which have to mean that he is probably headed for someone close to him. Further, why would his brother know where Kyung-chul is headed, and how on earth did he wake up from a brain trauma with few slaps in the face. Further, why on earth would he provoke someone who nearly killed him? None of these actions made sense. I'm assuming that his brother was there for some kind of comic relief , but this was neither amusing nor relevant to the plot. He could have probably stopped Kyung-chul from killing his father in law, if he used his brain for just one second. Further, I'm confused as to how Kim soo hyeon would put his hand in someone's mouth and rip one's mouth open, without getting seriously bit. Even Kyung-chul's action doesn't make much sense as it would be more logical for him to go for Kim soo hyeon's parents instead of his father in law. Next, how did he retrieve the GPS device after Kyung-chul made a random civilian swallow it in the bathroom(he used the device at the end of the movie so he can hear his family suffer which I find very unnecessary and over-the-top). Am I to believe that Kim soo hyeon actually retrieved it somehow from a civilian's mouth when he was in a hurry to find Kyung- chul (just so he can use it at the end for dramatic effect?) Also, I hated the part when Kyung-chul's wife was getting killed. I feel terrible for saying this, but making a female victim pregnant is such a hackneyed and clichéd way to make the viewer feel emotional connection with the victim that I honestly found myself laughing through this part. Fight scenes were also pretty corny and no where near as gritty as many top Korean thrillers I've seen (old boy, chaser...). It was just some pretty-boy doing his very best not to dirty his leather jacket for the most part (again reminiscent of many Hollywood films). Kim soo hyeon honestly seemed to try so hard to preserve his ""cool"" image that it definitely overshadowed any kind of emotion coming from him. I could go on and on, but I think I'll just stop here. Aside from few beautiful scenes (especially the beginning sequence when soo hyeon's wife gets dragged away in the snow), this movie was weak in its plots, dialogues, and character developments and had so many flaws. I do not believe this movie deserves the 7.9 rating it has, and, in my honest opinion, this is probably on par with ""I spit on your grave."" Also I am not a troll trying to provoke people. I genuinely want to know what most people here sees in this movie.",I Saw the Devil

337,saadyoussefi,Very engaging and powerful revenge movie,9,17 January 2012,"I have always been impressed by Korean cinema - so emotionally engaging and powerful. Revenge is a common theme in the best Korean movies... and this one definitely keeps the bar high...It is interesting to show the change in the protagonist (victim)'s character/personality as he becomes colder and more violent. He wants to try and make the serial killer suffer and experience the same emotions and fear that his wife and victims have... while this seems to be a straightforward goal, and the protagonist knows that it will take time. He unfortunately has a ruthless and insensitively cold opponent. This naturally brings the worst (torturer, inhumane) from him. While he realizes that he will never be able to bring his wife back, he nevertheless, embarks and pursues his promise until the very end in a strikingly bold fashion to make the killer breakdown. Once again Min-Sik Choi delivers a fantastic performance, as well as the protagonist. This movie reminds me very much of The Chaser, which I thought was amazing too and Min-Sik Choi's performance is comparable to my all-time favorite movie, Oldboy. While there are similarities between Seven and I Saw the Devil, I think the analogy ends with the common revenge theme. Seven is much more about the criminal investigation and dynamics between Morgan Freeman (experienced and retiring officer) and Brad Pitt (fresh and (over)confident new officer). I Saw the Devil does not have those themes, its crude violence and limited dialog (esp. the protagonist) is relied upon to show the extent of his sorrow and animosity. A large part of the movie revolves around the protagonist's antipathy against himself for having put himself and family in the situation he got into.",I Saw the Devil
338,jenka-3,"Dark, Horrifying, Excellent.",10,12 March 2011,"First off, a lot of people reviewing are missing the point to this film. They write a lot of things about the violence and obscure scenes and they totally miss the point of the movie. You cant summarize this movie with what you see, it needs to take a count for what it makes you feel.Yes the movie is very violent, very bloody. It will make you cover your eyes of obscenity. Those scenes set up the movie to the emotions you the viewer needs to be in to understand the point of the movie. I think the writer wants to make your mind go to dark places, very dark places. It want's you to scream ""REVENGE"" and ""MAKE HIM SUFFER"" and the beauty of the movie is that it does this, perfectly. When the movie comes closer to a conclusion the main point of the movie is revealing it self. You can't get revenge, all you have done to try to get revenge has made you loose even more. All the suffering you inflicted to the villain wont make him regret what he did or ever fear what you will do to him. ""You lost already"" is the line that says it all.The movie is a breath of fresh air, one of the best movies i have ever seen.

341,changdaekim75,Just another bloody movie,4,17 August 2010,"I was visiting some friends in Seoul and we decided to see a movie. They said let's see ""I saw the devil"" because we just wanted a horror flick. I also saw a very popular actor as the protagonist in this film. So I was like ""hey, why not?"". Big mistake.The beginning was a decent start off with a good, expected scare. Basically, a woman is stuck in the snow waiting in her car for a tow truck. In the meantime, a car stops-by and a creepy guy comes out and offers to give her a ride. She is talking with her fiancé, who is, interestingly enough, a South Korean C.I.A. agent, and she refuses to go with this creepy guy. The creepy guy disappears, but... the car doesn't leave. You can guess what happens, and the C.I.A. agent begins his hunt on his wife's murderer. It goes downhill from then on. The plot is fairly weak. The movie is pure gore, body parts, and blood. The complete dehumanization of women and the practice of cannibalism. The protagonist finds the guy in due time, but instead of killing him right away, he decides to make him suffer every time he attempts to do a bad deed; trust me, this guy won't stop committing disgusting crimes. The movie does have its funny moments, but the previous grotesque scenes refused to let me smile. Lee Byung-hun reminds of the ""hulk"" in this movie. His anger won't let him stop, and in the end, it gets the best of him. Don't get me wrong though, I still think he's a good actor, and he did his job, but I still don't know if this was the right film for him. During the movie, my friends that were girls left after 30 minutes. Many other women also left afterwords. The guys, including me, were just trying to bear it. At one point, we thought it was over, and we were happy, but no, still over an hour left. It was like an attempt at a ""snuff film"". I heard that in the original film even had body parts set out for dinner being eaten. Oh god, i hope an ""unrated"" version does not come out because there were quite a few scenes removed to get it reduced to NC-18 (NC-19 in Korea since age is counted differently from the US). I feel as if the director made an attempt at matching, even surpassing, the gore and scare in the Hollywood horror market. The scare? Not so much. The gore? Yes, I don't want to see it again. If you want a scare, go see the ring. If you want to see something full of intesnse images without a good plot, here it is. 4 out of 10. (Lee Byung-hun is the still awesome)",I Saw the Devil
342,inkgrenade,Haunting but beautiful.,10,18 November 2010,"Whenever I see a negative review of ""I Saw the Devil"", the critic always mentions (scornfully) that the movie is ultra violent and portrays women in horrifying circumstances. Yes it is, and yes it does.But this isn't a Hollywood slasher flick. The kills in this movie are not gratifying and aren't meant to be. The women being killed are not scantily clad models running through forests from men wearing masks. There is nothing pleasant or ""cool"" about these scenes; they make the viewer uncomfortable, they unsettle, they bring one's mind into very dark places. It gives us a peek into the madness that every man is capable of, and does so realistically and without pulling its punches. This brutal realism makes people uncomfortable, and prompts negative reviews. This is understandable, but unfortunate. I believe that a movie should be judged on more than the amount of blood the viewer is comfortable seeing on-screen. To these people, please, do not watch Korean revenge thrillers if you are uncomfortable with torture or blood.But enough of that rambling. This movie is excellent. Beautiful cinematography contrasts the stark, dimly lit scenes where the murders, or gritty fight scenes, occur. The camera work is simple but effective; the viewer is often treated to close-ups of both Byung-hun Lee and Mik-sik Choi, and their facial expressions tell us more than dialogue ever could. There is also contrast between Lee and Choi. Lee, clean and stoic, and Choi, filthy and madly expressive. They compliment each other very well, and play off of each others strengths effectively.The story itself is typical of revenge films, but fantastic in its execution. Lee's character experiences a profound loss at the hands of Choi's character, and in the process of seeking revenge begins to resemble the man he so hates. The line between ""victim"" and ""aggressor"" becomes blurred between both characters. This is where the film shines. There is no black and white in ""I Saw the Devil""; the viewer is left with shades of grey.As for the acting, it was all done very well. As I mentioned, Lee and Choi work well together, and all supporting cast members did an excellent job. Choi portrays his character in an incredibly convincing manner, shifting suddenly from calmness to manic anger, but never in a way that feels unnatural or forced. Lee's character is quiet and much less expressive, but he does very well in showing immense amounts of emotion through just his eyes or subtle movements of his body. A memorable performance from them both.As for flaws, the only thing I can think of is the strange, perhaps unrealistic behaviour of the police. Lee is a member of the NIS, and is very skilled when it comes to remaining hidden, but that shouldn't make him untouchable when directly provoking police officers or driving on the wrong side of the street. Still, though, it's a very trivial complaint that isn't worth a deducted point.A confident 10/10 from me. If you are comfortable seeing serial murder portrayed realistically, and are able to appreciate more than just gore, please, do yourself a favour and watch this film.",I Saw the Devil

This brutally violent, dark revenge thriller comes from a country famous for violent and dark revenge thrillers, yet manages to set itself far above the pack not only by being a masterpiece of direction and cinematography, but by never loosing sight of the reality of the situation and the fallout that our protagonists actions cause; blurring the line between good and evil.All actors give very solid performances, excellent in some cases, but special mention must go to Min-sik Choi as the psychotic serial killer Kyung-chul. A very different character to that of Oldboy's Oh Dae- Su, he never-the-less delivers an equally exceptional performance, creating one of the most disturbing movie villains since Hannibal Lecter.Some truly incredible action scenes, weaved amongst some genuinely emotional moments derived from great chemistry between the two lead actors; this movie has a lot to offer, providing the violence isn't too much for you.

359,feyzahatifarslan,It gave me a stomachache but I'm not sure in a good way.,7,18 October 2020,Really solid revenge story made beautifully and very thrilling. Storytelling was one of the best ones out there but sometimes it got hard for me to watch especially at the beginning of the movie but I think that's what the movie tried to.,I Saw the Devil
360,kevintanhssd,"Haunting, but ruined by bad script",6,22 April 2018,"There are many good things about this movie, unfortunately, it has just as many problems. 
First of all, this is not a movie for a faint of heart. It's gory, shocking, and will make you uncomfortable. However, these scenes were there not for pure shock value, but rather, to serve as a bold, direct look at the absolute worst of humanity. For the most part, this direction worked, and helped set this movie apart from other horror, thriller flicks. The direction and cinematography were also gripping and competent. Every actors did their best, and the two main characters, particularly Choi Min Sik's murderer, were very well performed. All of this created a powerful, brutal, and almost impossible to look away movie. However this only maintain for about 2/3 of the way.
This movie has a major flaw, and that is the script. The basic idea is an interesting one, and the execution was competent. However, the script as a whole lacks gravity in many parts, things happened that feel forced and unnecessary, and toward the end, it slipped into zone of stupidity (Characters that set up to be ""smart, cool"" yet didn't see the most obvious things that would definitely happened. The police was a complete and utter joke...etc...) In fact, the last 20 - 30 minutes of the film was so poorly written, it almost single-handedly killed all the goodwill that it has been building up for over an hour. Ultimately, I left with a rather bad taste in my mouth.",I Saw the Devil

362,barnezboi,"Exquisite, effective and merciless",8,18 August 2010,"First and foremost, much of this movie borders on, for lack of a better word, the obscene. There are plenty of scenes that bring to mind soft-core pornography, and the violence is incredibly gory and at times, over the top. Some of the actions performed on screen will make most viewers squirm uncomfortably, while a vast majority of those that aren't will let the audience's mind drift to some very, very scary places. In short, its a visceral thriller. The movie is essentially driven by both lead characters trying to inflict as much pain and terror in one another as possible. Unlike most serial killer/crime thrillers, both the two characters collide (in violent, brutal fashion) with one another many, many times, leaving each other bloodied and eager for the next encounter. During these scenes, the movie takes on an unexpected action tone, with plenty of engaging fights that include knives, scythes, screwdrivers and in one scene, a fire extinguisher. In between these scenes the audience is shown the full depravity of the serial killer's psychopathic nature, who pretty much succeeds on setting the bar for on screen insanity.If this sounds like a mindless action/thriller summer film, you'd be mistaken. Both Choi M.S and Lee B.H deliver great performances, with Choi in particular acting disturbingly convincing as a completely unhinged maniac. The plot, although somewhat predictable, is nonetheless entertaining and once set in motion, incredibly gripping. There are plenty of cheap ""boo! gotcha"" scares, but some scenes are masterfully crafted to generate a LOT of tension. Believe me when I say that there were plenty of scenes where you could literally see that the rest of the audience wasn't even breathing, much less moving. As mentioned earlier, the action scenes are shot surprisingly well, and there's a certain pleasure to be derived from watching the hunter become hunted... and in such an exquisite, effective and merciless manner.On an aside, the movie seems to have remake potential with Hollywood production. Perhaps starring Will Smith and Robert Downey Jr. (as a serial killer? wouldn't you be terrified?), with maybe... Danny Boyle at the helm? Hopefully the movie does well enough in its release to receive any considerations.",I Saw the Devil
