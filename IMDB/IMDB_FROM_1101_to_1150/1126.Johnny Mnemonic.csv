0,Leofwine_draca,More like Johnny Moronic,4,8 August 2016,"In terms of creating the futuristic society of 2021, JOHNNY MNEMONIC is pretty good. A combination of complex sets, computer graphics, and some bizarrely-dressed extras make up a grungy and dirty universe of pollution, disease and violent death. Not exactly an original idea, but at least some of writer William Gibson's influence wears off and the film has a realistic setting for once. What a shame, then, that as a thriller, JOHNNY MNEMONIC is so flat. The interesting, original concept of data transference via the human brain is used only as an excuse for some flashy computer graphics - dated already in the seven years since the film first came out - and some techno-babble which sounds cool but has no meaning. Instead the film becomes a series of poorly put-together action sequences which are badly-edited and lacking in excitement. I never thought a film in which a guy wields and decapitates people with an electric whip would be boring, but it is, for the most part.The film has loads of characters and none of them are really developed, other than being ""allies"" or ""enemies"". There's some weak comic relief and some bad emoting and acting from Keanu Reeves but otherwise no attempt is made to examine the various characters or their motivations. Take Ice-T's man of mystery, for instance; what do we learn about this badly-dressed citizen of the future? Nothing, other than he's a resistance fighter or something like that. Of course one of the film's biggest flaws is in the central casting of Reeves as a desperate hero; this is at the opposite end of the movie quality spectrum from THE MATRIX and about a tenth as entertaining. Reeves is wooden, wooden, wooden, and quite pathetic at times. His supporting players don't help, either; seemingly a cast of well-established talents, from all areas of the field, were brought together for this movie and then utterly wasted in rubbish parts.Dina Meyer (STARSHIP TROOPERS) should be sassy, agile and sexy as the female sidekick, but she just appears dull and self-centred. Similarly Takeshi Kitano exudes menace and evilness just from his face alone but his villain is a weak, rather stupid man who gets betrayed by an obvious enemy. Even good old Udo Kier appears in a stupid comic/dramatic role as ""Ralfi"", but is again wasted in what amounts to little more than a cameo. That leaves Dolph Lundgren in one of his most bizarre turns as the 'Street Preacher' a hired killer who spends the latter half of the movie tracking Keanu Reeves down and attempting to kill him. After his villainous turn in UNIVERSAL SOLDIER (which made the film, as far as I'm concerned), it goes without saying that Lundgren can be menacing and nasty with the best of them, but he has little to do here, gets stupid dialogue, and isn't nasty enough. JOHNNY MNEMONIC is an often visually interesting film to watch but lacks excitement, intelligence or originality in it's oh-so-predictable chase thriller storyline.",Johnny Mnemonic
1,SnoopyStyle,Great Concepts need better visual effects,7,9 October 2013,"It's the year 2021, and the whole world is suffering from the Nerve Attenuation Syndrome (NAS). Johnny Mnemonic (Keanu Reeves) has an implanted memory chip, and much of his memory erased to create space to store computer data. He's been hired to transport important data while trying to escape from the Yakuza. On his journey, he's helped by bio-engineered muscle Jane (Dina Meyer), and anti-government group led by J-Bone (Ice-T).The similarities to The Matrix is astounding. I'm not saying there's any copying, but I'm sure the Wachowski brothers had a lot of this in mind when they cast Keanu Reeves. He's basically playing the same cool emotionless hero. There are guys in black trench coats. They're dealing a lot of issues with computers. There is a lot of Asian motif. In the end, they are not really the same. I like to call this the trial run for the Matrix. You can see some of the problems. The budget isn't big enough. The real effects are too clunky. The computer FX and graphics would vastly improve in the Matrix. Overall there are all kinds of ideas in this movie that a real world setting just won't do it justice. The story is simple enough. It's a quest and a road story. There are good guys and bad guys. What this movie really need is a better visual effects department.",Johnny Mnemonic
2,gavin6942,Not As Bad As...,6,30 October 2017,"A data courier (Keanu Reeves), literally carrying a data package inside his head, must deliver it before he dies from the burden or is killed by the Yakuza.Author William Gibson said, ""Basically what happened was it was taken away and re-cut by the American distributor in the last month of its pre-release life, and it went from being a very funny, very alternative piece of work to being something that had been very unsuccessfully chopped and cut into something more mainstream."" That is a fairly understanding position from the author.Truthfully, this is not that bad of a movie. While maybe not as great as it could be, it works well as a 1990s futuristic thriller. The ideas are interesting, and it is even more interesting considering that Reeves went on to star in ""The Matrix"", which has a similar feel in many ways.Interesting note: This was Dolph Lundgren's last theatrically released film until 2010's ""The Expendables"". What an unfortunate 15 years that was for all the cinema fans.",Johnny Mnemonic
3,Tweekums,Okay if rather dated Keanu Reeves Cyberpunk,6,11 August 2014,"In a future where data is power, protagonist Johnny makes a living smuggling the data in his own brain. The upgrades enabling him to do this meant removing some of his own memories and now he is ready to retire and wants them back inevitably he must do just one more job first. The job involves carrying stolen data from Beijing to Newark, New Jersey. There are two problems though; firstly there is more data than he is equipped to handle so he will die if it isn't extracted in forty eight hours and secondly the original owners of the data want it back and have sent Yakuza killers after him to retrieve his head! Once in Newark he learns that his employer has double-crossed him; he is forced to go on the run with cybernetically enhanced bodyguard Jane to find somebody else capable of extracting the data and delivering it to those who need it.This film had promise but unfortunately ends up fairly average. The world shown is a cliché dystopia; the corporate elite live the good life and dress in sharp suits while everybody else seems to live in a wasteland in rough clothes and sporting facial tattoos. Keanu Reeves is okay as Johnny, and Udo Kier is amusing as his agent but Takeshi Kitano is wasted as the corporate bad guy. The computer special effects are fairly dated now. If you can ignore these flaws or even enjoy their cheesiness the film isn't too bad. Overall I'd say it is an okay way to kill an hour and a half but if you want a really good cyberpunk film from that era watch 'Ghost in the Shell' or 'The Matrix'.",Johnny Mnemonic
4,wes-connors,Bring Me the Head of Keanu Reeves!,5,28 February 2010,"In the year 2021, ""Keanu Reeves is a space-age courier who's plugged in, turned on, and buffed up to deliver the most important data of the 21st century, wet-wired directly into his brain,"" according to the DVD sleeve's description. What Mr. Reeves doesn't know is that his latest download may be connected to the cure for the computer era's most deadly disease, a malady called Nerve Attenuation Syndrome (NAS). Everyone in the future seems to be at risk for NAS - something like this will probably happen in real life. Even Reeves' bodyguard, sexy Dina Meyer (as Jane), is afflicted. Needless to say, our hero and Ms. Meyer find themselves in mortal danger.Nasty Takeshi Kitano (as Takahashi) is willing to chop off Reeves' eyebrow-plucked head to get the valuable data loaded in the handsome courier's brain, but he'll have to beat dangerous street preacher Dolph Lundgren (as Karl) to the punch. Rapper Ice-T (as J-Bone) and rocker Henry Rollins (as Spider) join Meyer in trying to keep Reeves' from losing his head. Director Robert Longo brings writer William Gibson's story to the screen with some arresting visuals; but, their ""Johnny Mnemonic"" is disappointing. The bigger names in the cast seem unfocused, with only Mr. Lundgren and some of the minor characters providing focused characterizations.***** Johnny Mnemonic (4/15/95) Robert Longo ~ Keanu Reeves, Dina Meyer, Ice-T, Dolph Lundgren",Johnny Mnemonic
5,BandSAboutMovies,WOAH,4,12 April 2021,"The Turing test is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit the same intelligent behavior as a human. It often shows up in cyberpunk movies, so I've devised my own test. The ancient future test is one to determine if the movie that you are watching fits into that genre, a time when books like Neuromancer were being strip-mined for ideas to make high concepts films that were five minutes into the future in the 1990s but are now hopelessly mired in the past.Let's give Johnny Mnemonic this test.Does it have the title of a Philip K. Dick book but not really have much to do with it?Nope, but it was based on the story of the same name by cyberpunk godfather William Gibson - who wrote the aforementioned Neuromancer - so it's the next best thing.Is there a lot of rain?It doesn't have to rain all the time, unless you're in this movie.Does the male hero wear dress clothes and/or a trenchcoat?It's Keanu. Of course he has on a black tie.Do Keanu Reeves, Ben Affleck, Dolph Lundgren or Udo Keir appear in it?Beyond Keanu, Dolph and Udo show up.Does the internet do something it can't do yet, yet look dated AF?It's 300 baud in a 5G world, baby.Are Stabbing Westward, KMFDM, Ministry or God Lives Underwater on the soundtrack?Oh man, does it ever. You get Stabbing Westward twice, KMFDM, God Lives Underwater and Orbital, as well as Helmet and Rollins Band for the kids who like it loud. And oh yeah. Bono and The Edge for some reason.Is it a crappy version of Blade Runner?Actually, it's a crappy version of William Gibson.Are there numerous Asian-influenced scenes?This movie is so Japanese that it debuted in Japan and has Takeshi ""Beat"" Kitano in a major role.Do people use future terms that make no sense?Bleep boop yep.Are there a lot of whirring sound effects?The movie is mainly people making whirring sounds at one another. I'm joking, but it feels like it.Do people stare at the camera as it moves through a neon-lit strip club?This movie takes place in numerous neon-lit strip clubs and drinking establishments.Are there rock stars are in it?Are there ever! Ice-T and Henry Rollins!Is there a feral child?This is a trick question. A feral child means that you are watching a post-apocalyptic movie and not a cyberpunk film.Director Robert Longo is a real artist, making everything from music with his band Robert Longo's Menthol Wars to creating a series of drawings called Men in the Cities (you can see some of them in Patrick Bateman's apartment in American Psycho), who found his way into making music videos for New Order (""Bizarre Love Triangle"") and R. E. M. (""The One I Love"").After directing ""This'll Kill Ya"" from the TV series Tales from the Crypt, he started talking to Gibson about making a low budget art film for the story Johnny Mnemonic. He told Wired in 2010 that the film ""started out as an arty one-and-a-half-million-dollar movie, and it became a 30-million-dollar movie because we couldn't get a million and a half.""The movie is quite different from the source material - a common ancient future/cyberpunk trope - particularly because the Molly Millions character didn't belong to the film's producers, so Johnny had to become the action hero. Plus, well, this was cyberpunk's mainstream debutante ball, so rough edges like drug addiction had to be deleted.Gibson would say, ""Basically what happened was it was taken away and re-cut by the American distributor in the last month of its pre-release life, and it went from being a very funny, very alternative piece of work to being something that had been very unsuccessfully chopped and cut into something more mainstream.""The Japanese version of the film is much closer to the original cut, if it helps.This film takes place in 2021, a time when everyone is on the internet all day, something that could never happen. All this overuse has led to NAS (Nerve Attenuation Syndrome), a disease that causes hostility and black outs. One company has figured out the cure and has hired memory courier Johnny Mnemonic (Reeves) to allow them to hack his brain and transport the information.Oh man, this movie. The images in Johnny's head are wanted by everyone, like the Yakuza - of course - and Japanese and Chinese corporations. One of them, Pharmakom, is run by Takeshi and he's sent a man named the Street Preacher (Lundgren) to cut off our hero's head and get his brain.Luckily, a cybernetic bodyguard named Jane (Dina Meyer) saves him, along with the Lo-Teks gang led by J-Bone (Ice-T) and a cybernetic surgeon named Spider (Rollins). There's also an AI ghost inside his brain and, of course, a psychic Navy dolphin that is ready to help him hack his own brain.Sony went all-in to market this movie, with video games, soundtracks, a pinball machine and one of the first web experiences that offered $20,000 in prizes. Gibson referred to their web promotions as ""kind of cute.""Johnny Mnemonic disappeared from theaters but hasn't gone away. The mega-hyped release of Cyberpunk 2077 had you play a character with information in your brain that everyone wants, as well as the avatar of dead rock star Johnny Silverhand, played by - you guessed it - Keanu Reeves.",Johnny Mnemonic
6,Theo Robertson,Try And Imagine The Matrix During A Power Cut,4,1 August 2013,"I've got a bit of a problem writing this review because immediately after seeing JOHNNY MNEMONIC I can hardly recall a thing about it . If I remember correctly it involves Keanu Reeves playing Keanu Reeves getting something downloaded in to his head and going somewhere to download it in to something and constantly bumping in to foul mouthed non actors every ten minutes . Have I got that right ? The screenplay is written by William Gibson , the purveyor of a science fiction of sub-genre called Cyberpunk which was very popular in the late 1989s and early 1990s but didn't translate at all well in to cinema . Without doubt the most successful Cyberpunk movie was the original version of THE MATRIX and as the sequels even the success of that film was probably down to a case of style over substance . The problem with JM is that too is trying to be style over substance and there's very little style to it It's a film trying to emulate the look of BLADERUNNER but director Robert Longo is no Ridley Scott . He also doesn't do his cause any good by casting Henry Rollins and Ice-T who give the impression they think they were going to be appearing in a cool hip movie only to find they weren't and reacted by giving disinterested performances . The worst aspect is the cinematography were everything is so dimly lit that it's impossible to see what is going on in the background or indeed if there is anything going on the background . Add to this a storyline that is often confusing then you've got a film that fails to hold the interest and is difficult to remember moments after seeing it",Johnny Mnemonic
7,LeonLouisRicci,UNDERRATED CULT-MOVIE...EXPLORING INTERNET INFORMATION...FIRST-WAVE OF CYBER-PUNK,7,17 August 2021,"Author William Gibson, a Leader in the ""Cult of Cyber-Punk"" World, Wrote the Screen-Play from His Own Story.Kneau Reeves, in an Exercise Exploring the Possibilities of Becoming a Better Actor,Shouts Lines with Over Gesture.More Lessons in the Art of Acting Needed Forth-With.The Computer Graphics, circa 1995, are State of the Art, and Look Like Painting with an Electric Brush.It has a Sort of Retro-Charm Today.The Story is a Simple One.Reeves Mnemonic, has a Brain that has been ""Wet-Wired"" with a Device to Store Memory.This Makes Him a Cyber-Courier.He Overloads on the Data Causing Him Impending Death and Immediate Convulsions.The Yakuzi have been Hired to Retrieve Reeves' Head (literally), because the Information is in High Demand from ""Take Over the World"" Types.The Info Contains a Cure for a Current Spreading Virus NAS, that was Caused by Electronic Pollution from all of Society's Plug-In Demands.Dolph Lundgren Shows Up as an Apocalyptic Preacher Stereotype and Almost Steals the Show from the Real-Life Actors,Chanting ""Come to Jesus"" as He Ministers Death and Destruction.An Underrated, Little Appreciated Stab at Turning the Quickly Evolving Internet and Computers that was Very New in 1995.Certainly Not as Good as the Sum of its Parts.

8,CinemaSerf,A chip from the old block...,5,25 September 2021,"Perhaps back in 1995 the year 2021 did seem like it was an aeon away, but now that we are all actually here, this film really does struggle to resonate on just about every level. Keanu Reeves is a good looking star, but that's about the height of it. The scenario is nothing new - mankind is dependent on technology and about to be subject to a criminally backed corporation's attempts to dominate us. This time, it falls to our hero and his semi-luddite pals to access a micro-chip embedded in his brain to save humanity from oblivion. It's quickly paced, to be fair, and the star does an adequate job trying to keep one step ahead of his deadly, if not terribly effective, Yakuza pursuers but the dialogue is flat (and not terribly audible) and the supporting cast - drawn from a collection of B-listers, musicians and featuring the discobolus-like Dolph Lundgren as baddie-in-chief just follows a join the dots pattern. Maybe it's unfair to look back on it after 25 years with today's eyes - but sadly, like so many of these films, neither the talent not the visuals really stand the test of time at all well. It wasn't great then, it certainly isn't now.",Johnny Mnemonic
9,Calicodreamin,Cool concept,4,1 November 2021,"Certainly a cool concept for a movie, but just too goofy. The acting was mediocre and storyline gets lost midway through and struggles to the end. The CGI is bad, even for '95.",Johnny Mnemonic
10,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Not too memorable,6,15 July 2006,"I've been a fan of William Gibson for a few years... I've read his Cyberspace trilogy and Virtual Light. This film is easily recognized as a work of his... the body-upgrading implants, the visual representation of cyberspace and the dystopic future world are among the trademarks of his work that is seen here. They might not be terribly well-presented, but at least they're there. His creativity is also all there. In expanding his short story to fit feature length, Gibson puts in too many subplots, too much symbolism and in the end, it just feels to ""big"", especially with all the un- and underdeveloped material. Sad, considering this man coined the term Cyberspace and basically predicted what we're moving terribly close to in terms of everyday life(superficiality reigning, and technology as part of us human beings). I'm impressed with his writings, and I may look for the original story behind this film. I might even try my luck with the one other feature production based on his work. The plot is interesting enough, takes off as it should, and develops fine. It's somewhat predictable, though, in spite of some good surprises, early on. The pacing is fairly good, though it slows down somewhat near the very end, and at one or two other points throughout the film. The action is OK, though quickly forgotten. The cinematography is pretty... Longo may not know much, but he knows how to assemble nice-looking shots. The acting is so-so. The dialog ranges... at times, it's really good, but some lines are downright embarrassing. For the most part, it's at least fair. Gibson's sense of humor and social commentary is clearly present, which is nice. Also, for any other fans of him reading this... there is, in fact, some hacking in the film. It was definitely what I enjoyed most about the film. The effects are fine, if dated today(obviously, since the film is a decade old). The DVD has a few special features, which are fair. All in all, you're probably better off reading the short story. OK for a rental or if you can watch it for free, and you're a big fan of Gibson or someone else who had a lot of creative control on this film. I recommend this only to the biggest fans of William Gibson and possibly others who worked on it. 6/10",Johnny Mnemonic
11,view_and_review,Johnny Mnemonic a Predecessor for Later Tech Movies,7,25 August 2020,"It seems ""Johnny Mnemonic"" was a warmup role for Keanu for ""The Matrix."" ""Johnny Mnemonic"" is a dystopian future in which he had to jack in and out through his head. More specifically, ""Johnny Mnemonic"" took place in the year 2021 (next year folks) and a disease called NAS (Nerve Attenuation Syndrome) is killing most of the population. Corporations run everything and LoTeks are the poor resistance fighters. The corporations use the Yakuza to hunt downJohnny (Keanu Reeves) is a data smuggler. He's been outfitted with a brain implant that's been wet wired into his brain. The mnemonics have quite a bit of storage capacity (at least per 1995 standards when the movie was released), but if they exceed that storage limit it will kill them.On Johnny's last mission he uploaded 320Gb of data to his 160Gb brain implant, so death was imminent for him if he didn't get the data out of his head within 24 hours.The 90's is when we saw a big uptick in techy movies: ""Lawnmower Man,"" ""The Net,"" ""Johnny Mnemonic,"" ""Ghost in the Machine,"" ""Virtuosity,"" ""T2,"" and others. They were very primitive compared to today, but they were important. They paved the way for tech movies of the 2000's.""Johnny Mnemonic"" was primitive, but I could see the improvements over movies like ""Lawnmower Man."" Some of the stuff in this movie can be seen in ""The Matrix"" and ""Minority Report."" The action was somewhat disappointing. The fight scenes looked as if each fighter was patiently waiting to be hit or kicked. The acting also wasn't the greatest: Keanu is Keanu, he picks good movies to be in, but he's not coming close to winning an Oscar and the same can be said about Ice-T and Dolph Lungren. As a story, the movie was above par (or is that below par). Never mind. It was good, it only needed the other elements to be better to help it out.",Johnny Mnemonic
12,Uriah43,A Film with Enormous--but Unrealized--Potential,5,27 August 2020,"This film begins in the near future with a plague known as ""the Nerve Attenuation Syndrome"" causing widespread damage to the economies of the world resulting in the major corporations assuming control over everything. And to further strengthen their grip on their spheres of power the corporations hire the Yakuza to ruthlessly enforce their control over all technological data to keep it away from their rivals. This secrecy subsequently produces a new method of espionage in which an electronically enhanced person stores vast amounts of data into his brain and is therefore able to move from one corporate sphere to another to deliver this information for a certain price. One such courier is ""Johnny Mnemonic"" (Keanu Reeves) who is offered a generous sum of money to download an extremely large program in Beijing and deliver it to another corporation in Newark. However, the data that he agrees to accept is many times larger than his storage capacity allows and as a result his life is put in serious jeopardy if he cannot have it extracted within a few days. Needless to say, the corporation he stole the data from desperately wants it back and immediately puts out a lucrative contract on his head-literally. To complicate matters even more, what he doesn't know is that his agent, ""Ralfi"" (Udo Kier) has betrayed him to the highest bidder and as a result he is forced to go underground where all manner of criminals and misfits are waiting for him. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a film with enormous potential but was badly served by some of the rather ridiculous characters displayed--with the ""Street Preacher"" (Dolph Lundgren) being especially annoying. Likewise, the lack of chemistry between Johnny Mnemonic and his bodyguard ""Jane"" (Dina Meyer) was also quite noticeable. Be that as it my, as stated earlier this film had enormous potential. Unfortunately, it failed to live up to it to a great degree and as a result I rate is as only average.",Johnny Mnemonic

Pursued by Yakuza agents and a crazed cyborg, Johnny must deliver the data or die in twenty-four hours......Everyone in the world knows that Reeves isn't the best actor in the world, but the man has more screen presence than half of Hollywood. He's a bonafide movie star, and although there are times when you cannot help but laugh at his delivery of lines, you couldn't imagine anyone else as Neo, John Wick, and we all secretly know Speed 2 would have been a huge hit if he was in it.This though, isn't terrible because of Reeves, it's terrible because despite co I g from a decent source, it's narrative is clunky, there are far too many characters giving Basil Exposition, and in the end, it becomes very incoherent.But Reeves, he is really bad in this, and considering this isn't long after Speed, it's surmising he didn't go for something more mainstream.Seriously, the best thing about this film is Dolph Lundgren, and he's barely in it, as this really bizarre Jesus loving, robotic assassin.So we spend the entirety of the film with Johnny being told the plot,of the film by Udo Kier, Dina Meyer, Ice T, and Henry Rollins.Every now and again we get a VR sequence where Johnny turns into the slender man, and it all leads up to a dramatic showdown with Takeshi Kitano, a man with an electric whip, and a cyber-dolphin.But the film has to be seen for Reeves alone.

There is just something about this movie that appeals to me and it is the fact that it is just like a live anime movie.  Much more so than the ""Matrix"" which other than a couple of points is not as much of an anime movie as some have made it out to be.  Here the scenery and the characters and everything is very colorful like most animes are.  We have the plot that goes here and there just like an anime.  We have good looking gals that kick butt just like an anime.  We are not sure who is the main villain just like a lot of animes and then there is the villain that seems really strong and looks like he is important to the plot who ends up being a non-factor (Dolph's character) just like in an anime.  This one has Keanu as a courier who plants information in his head and delivers it.  Only there is a snag of course and he ends up being chased by all sorts of characters.

In this world, there is such an overload of technology and instant information from the Internet, that no one's secrets are safe online. For this reason, some men, like Johnny, have had part of their brains removed so that these anatomical parts can hold microchip data. Thus, they are modern couriers who deliver important documents to and fro. Also, the disparity between rich and poor is very prominent, with lots of street people and a few big wigs. Johnny is lucky to be sort of in the middle. One day, Johnny's head is loaded with information from a Japanese firm but there is trouble straight away. First, as Johnny goes to the bathroom, the men who gave him the data are assassinated. Our John barely gets away. Needing the help of some street folks like Jane (Dina Meyer), Spider (Henry Rollins) and J-Bone (Ice-T), the courier learns his brain is way overloaded and he will die if he can't find someone to accept the data. Naturally, the information is ultra-important for the world's health. His boss (Udo Kier) is a double-crosser, so he's no help. Also, a demonic street preacher (Dolph Lundgren) is put on his trail and told to eliminate Johnny. Who will be the last man standing? This story is really intriguing and science fiction fans would love to embrace it wholeheartedly. Unfortunately, the violence is over the top and damages the final product. Reeves does a fine job and looks great while the others do nice work, too, so the viewer does want to keep watching for their sakes.

All the characters are simply so so, and the story is very uneven, plus while i am a very big fan of Keanu Reeves, he looks really bored here and sleepwalks through the whole thing. Dina Meyer is probably the best character here, and while i am also a very big fan Of Lundgren he was way way too OTT here for my liking, plus The action is also rather bland. There are some moments, that were fun to watch, and the story was really quite intriguing and had a lot of potential, however, it just does not work. At times it seems like a dated poor man's version of The Matrix, and i really could care less about what happened to the characters here, plus Ice-T looks extremely bored here, and was laughable in his role. The ending was kind of cool, and the set pieces were quite cool as well, plus it takes way too long to get going and even when it does, it's still inconsistent. This is an average Reeves flick, that's very uneven and rather dull at times, with decent enough effects, but bland performances, i suppose it's worth the watch, but you could do a LOT better in my opinion. The Direction is so so. Robert Longodoes a so so job here, with good camera work, great angles, lots of stylish shots, however the pace is extremely inconsistent. The Acting is quite bland. Keanu Reeves is not his usual amazing self here, because he looked very bored, and basically sleepwalked through the whole thing, his chemistry with Meyer was OK though, it's just there was no life in his character, he still did OK though(Reeves Rules!!!!!!). Dina Meyer is very hot, and did excellent with what she had to do, she was my favorite character here, and had OK chemistry with reeves i really liked her. Ice-T is terrible here, he was extremely bland, and looked very bored and i don't blame him. Dolph Lundgren is also not his usual amazing self, he was way too OTT, and was simply laughable, and a result i found his character to be bland as well, he also had some terrible lines.

I've watched this movie many years ago so glad it's available on Amazon prime cause I haven't known where to find this treasure for way to long. Keanu Reeves was an exceptional actor in the 90's and still is just as famous nowadays which is an impressive aspect that not enough embrace especially better since he's in amazing shape. I love this movie for being ahead of its time and quite an entertaining experience!,Johnny Mnemonic
19,Thanos_Alfie,"""Johnny Mnemonic"" harbinger of ""The Matrix""...",6,16 August 2013,"""Johnny Mnemonic"" for many people considered as the harbinger of ""The Matrix"", but in any case we must not compare these two films. ""Johnny Mnemonic"" is a really different film from ""The Matrix"" with a lower budget and a lower improvement from the side of technology.It's a nice movie with a good performance by Keanu Reeves as Johnny Mnemonic and wonderful Dina Meyer as Jane. Ice-T as J-Bone and Takeshi Kitano as Takahashi made a good performances too.The story of this movie regards a man who use his mind as a hard drive and his self as a data courier to deliver packages from one man to another. One package is too big to deliver it but he gets this risk, so he want to deliver it as fast as he can not die from it.",Johnny Mnemonic
20,Dr_Coulardeau,The Brain as a ROM grafted on a RAM,9,9 August 2008,"A fascinating film that brings together several genres and also several influences. First the technical level of virtual reality and computerized graphics. Interesting though not exceptionally original (see for one example The Lawnmower Man). Second the Japanese, Chinese, Honk Kong, Kung Fu type of action. There it is in a way renewed because it is grafted onto, into or under another type of post-apocalyptic vision that is typically American: underground resistance (with one of the archetypes being the Terminator trilogy, or The Running Man) or people who refuse the modern slavery imposed by the corporate trust that governs and controls the world, through dependence on data-processing machines that create a nervous disorder that is both incurable and catching. The models of this underground vision are numerous. Here he sets it in the guts of an old decaying bridge, so over-ground and over-water, in between two banks it does not join any more. Great. The film adds to that a small dose of brain manipulation, mind torturing with elements that have been made famous by The Matrix trilogy for example. The most original element is that the brain is used as a data transporting device that cannot be hacked or pirated since it is not going through a digital network. And the last load of data comes from China (the future of the world?) though it is ridden with riots and rioting crowds (the anti-Chinese-communist element?) and has to be taken to the USA, Newark mind you, to be offered to the world for its own salvation by the underground resistance (the American boy-scout do-good syndrome?). Then the other interesting elements are more isolated elements here and there than structuring elements. The dolphin that this poor Johnny obstinately calls a fish is a nice piece of animal and mammal lore that makes the dolphin the saving intercessor of humanity. The criminal Christian preacher who crucifies his victims in the name of Jesus and God is a wink against the fake Christians who are selfish and interested, even greedy in money and power bigots. And the final liberation with a final scene of natural vegetation and landscape with real natural colors is very similar to the end of the third Matrix. But this time the intercessor, messenger or courier did not have to be sacrificed and he finds a new lease in life with some restored memory. Interesting indeed, but within a full background without which it looks slightly dry and sterile.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",Johnny Mnemonic
21,helpless_dancer,"Very, very dumb, boring film",1,9 April 1999,"I have no idea what took place in this movie. It made no sense, was pitifully acted, and the story was totally idiotic.

22,Polaris_DiB,Camp Prelude,7,24 July 2010,"Look, there is no arguing that this movie is dated and is rapidly becoming moreso. However, that does not change the fact that this cyberpunk gem stands firmly between Craig Baldwin's underground Spectres of the Spectrum and the Wachowski's mainstream hit The Matrix as a camp rebellion of digital overload in fetish costuming and grungy spectacle. Gibson provides the meat, Longo provides the gusto. From there, it's only a matter of wishing the acting was better and the graphics more advanced. However, digital effects had to develop somewhere between The Crow and Avatar. Hell, there's still an audience for this: why do you think cult filmgoers are turning out in droves for Repo: the Genetic Opera, arguably the musical version of this? Keanu Reeves plays an unknown prelude to his Neo role via postlude to his Bill and Ted role. To me, this works. For others, I can see what their problem is. But even beyond that, you still have Takeshi Kitano and Henry Rollins to contend with, and they take to their roles without any hesitation, and the result is good. You also have the, in my mind always appealing, assets in radiowave revolutionaries who fight the corporate machine in dirty reverse-engineered hacker lairs while still finding time to put on fantastic make-up and pleather over mesh clothing, Yakuza gangsters with katanas, guns, and lazer-strengthened piano wire, and tripped out mercenaries looking for a client while desperately staving off a tweaked-out race against time. Oh, and hacker dolphins. YEAH YOU HEARD ME. Hacker dolphins.So hate this movie if you want but this is the roots of all cyberpunk entertainment to me.--PolarisDiB",Johnny Mnemonic
23,strong-122-478885,That Does Not Compute!....,3,8 June 2014,"Like - WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED HERE??!! This Sci-Fi/Action/Thriller sure could have been about 10 zillion times better.Johnny Mnemonic certainly had oodles, and oodles of potential. I think that it could've easily been considered a kick-ass contender for a prime position right up there alongside The Matrix. But, unfortunately, this flick went nowhere. And it went there, fast.Set in the year 2021 where filth and ugliness prevails - Johnny is a 'Mnemonic Data Carrier' carrying 320 gigabytes of ultimately crucial information contained on a memory chip that has been surgically implanted directly into his brain. At this point, Johnny's information storage capacity is dangerously overloaded.Pursued by ruthless agents and deadly cyborgs, Johnny must deliver this all-important data to Newark within 24 hours, or else he must die.Johnny Mnemonic, most certainly, had a truly fascinating premise that if handled properly could've ranked it right up there with some of the best Sci-Fi films of all time. But, instead, all we are offered was a film that ranked right down there with some of the worst from that genre, ever. I'm not joking.Johnny Mnemonic is an utterly forgettable flick filled to overflowing with totally uninteresting characters mouthing laughable dialogue set against the back-drop of a hideous landscape of urban hell.",Johnny Mnemonic
24,dee.reid,"Helped to set the stage for ""The Matrix"" (1999) and beyond",7,14 March 2016,"""Johnny Mnemonic,"" released in 1995, had a lot of things going for it, with just as many things working against it. ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" (1991) had made a critical and commercial breakthrough in CGI special effects, and the visually dazzling ""The Lawnmower Man"" in 1992 helped to continue the trend. ""The Lawnmower Man"" was one of the earliest cyber-thrillers of the 1990s, picking up on the increasing relevance of computer technology and the nascent Internet craze (as well as the rising popularity of Japanese Anime'), thus paving the way for CGI special effects-laden cyber-thrillers like ""Johnny Mnemonic"" to make another breakthrough.""Johnny Mnemonic"" was a critical and commercial disappointment, but the film has nonetheless gained something of a cult status - again due largely to the underground cyberpunk sub-genre of science fiction, and, of course, the landmark breakthrough success of ""The Matrix"" (1999), which brought all this stuff together (amongst other influences from disparate genres) in one epic 136-minute feature and effectively legitimized cyberpunk and science fiction for the new millennium.In that regard, ""Johnny Mnemonic"" wasn't so much a failed effort as it was a premature one. Put simply, despite the underground popularity of cyberpunk and the increasing visibility of the computer hacker subculture, critics and audiences simply may not have been ready for this film - and aside from the usual quibbles with hammy dialogue and spotty direction. I was 10 in 1995, and vaguely recall the previews for this movie, and not paying any attention to it - because my mind was focused elsewhere. But I've seen the film off and on over the years, and after seeing ""The Matrix"" and reading up a little bit on cyberpunk, it becomes much easier to make the connection to ""Johnny Mnemonic"" (as well as the Anime' classic ""Ghost in the Shell,"" which came out the same year as this film, and 1982's ""Blade Runner"").Science fiction author William Gibson - who wrote the seminal cyberpunk novel ""Neuromancer"" in 1984 - wrote the screenplay for ""Johnny Mnemonic,"" which is adapted from one of his short stories. Robert Longo directed the film, and it stars Keanu Reeves, who at that time was hot off the success of ""Speed"" from one year before in 1994. Reeves may have been this film's other hindrance, which critics most likely picked up on, too.I've been saying for years that Reeves is an actor who knows his strengths and his weaknesses, and knows what he can and can't do as a performer - yet not everybody, critics and directors alike, seem aware of that. That doesn't necessarily make him a bad actor, but it shows that he's honest, and that he's more aware of his abilities than most people are willing to admit. But that's just my opinion; I'm sure others feel completely different about it.The film is set in January of 2021 - just five years from now - and is set at first in Beijing and later Newark, New Jersey. Reeves plays the title character, a ""wet-wired"" data courier (basically, a human hard drive) who is able to carry digitized data via a computer chip implant in his brain. At the beginning of the film, Japanese businessmen hire him to carry a large, classified data package to New Jersey, but just as the process is completed, assassins working for the Yakuza (Japanese mafia) come in and kill the executives. Johnny manages to barely escape with his life.Johnny then learns that the classified data that was downloaded into his head is too much for his brain to carry (320 gigabytes, which is apparently double the amount he can safely handle), and will kill him in two or three days time if it's not removed in time. Hounded by the Yakuza, who are led by a ruthless assassin named Shinji (Denis Akiyama, who carries a very lethal weapon to do his kills), as well as a crazed Street Preacher (Dolph Lundgren), Johnny has nowhere to turn to - with everyone, wanting his head served on a silver platter, literally, to Japanese pharmaceutical executive Takahashi (Takeshi) - except for a wannabe-bodyguard named Jane (Dina Meyer), an ex-doctor named Spider (Henry Rollins), and rebel leader J-Bone (Ice-T).There are action sequences and there are special effects - most of which would be considered laughable with today's advances in CGI technology, but were pretty state-of-the-art at the time of this film's release just 21 years ago. The film is by no means perfect, but it's really impressive to see Keanu Reeves in a cyber-thriller made just four years before he took the Red Pill in ""The Matrix"" and would change everything as we know it. But he's not Neo yet, and he can't defy gravity in ""bullet time"" - yet.""Johnny Mnemonic"" works best as a time capsule, and as perhaps a launching pad for future ideas, the same ideas that had been popular in cyberpunk science fiction for years by that point, but would not reach popular, mainstream acceptance for another four years.^ Whoa, at that last statement.P.S.: That Anime' film that the Japanese businessmen are watching at the beginning of the movie is ""Demon City Shinjuku"" (1988). LOL!7/10",Johnny Mnemonic
25,mattkratz,decent,8,9 January 2011,"I agree with Leonard Maltin's assessment of this movie-it's an intriguing idea that really doesn't get anywhere. The year is 2021, the internet has everyone trapped, and people are suffering from a disease called NAS. Keanu Reeves's character has a chip implanted in his brain that carries the cure, and the bad guys are after both him and it, trying to hunt them down, and a mysterious lady and some other characters are helping him. The movie was OK. Not bad, not great-just OK. My favorite scene was in the junkyard when the helicopter bad guys tried to bomb him, and Reeves gave a speech with some great lines.

End of the day, I'm a sucker for a solid dystopian movie with some crazy tech nonsense as long as it follows the rules of the universe and I feel like Johnny does that. Stuff's bonkers but it all fits within the realm of this film and I'm on board with it.That said, this movie is not for everyone and there are a lot of people that wont like this and have very good reasons not to.

28,PredragReviews,The Future Looks Disappointing...,5,20 April 2016,"Johhny Mnemonic's biggest enemy wasn't the Yakuza, PharmCom, NAS, or Dolph Lundgren. It was the dreaded bad sci-fi movie script that seems to plague a large number of otherwise promising films. The plot is more subtle than the instant, intense visuals let on (and this is where a lot of people seem to trip up as they do not see past the cheese) and the movie stands up well to multiple viewings. The performances in the film are pretty descent, with Henry Rollins who is on top of it, as the doctor Spider. Dolph Lundgren is at his psychotic best as the mercenary Street Preacher, and Ice-T is righteous and driven as the rebel leader J-Bone.All in all, this movie tries to do a lot of things and fails. It fails to be the feature-length version of the short story. It fails to be epic. It fails to be soul-searching, but succeeds at being preachy. And it also fails to be entertaining..Overall rating: 5 out of 10.",Johnny Mnemonic
29,philip_vanderveken,An uninspired movie that gives us a very dark view on our near future.,4,24 January 2005,"I guess the best way to describe this movie is to call it a mix between Sci-Fi, a comic book and an action movie. Apparently this is also called a cyberpunk movie. I have to admit that I didn't really know that genre yet, but if this is what all the movies in this genre look like, than I'm not a fan of it.It's 2021 and everybody is connected by the Internet. But almost half of the world's population is suffering from the Nerve Attenuation Syndrome (NAS). Johnny Mnemonic is a data courier. To become a data courier, he had to give up some of his long term memory that contained all his childhood memories so a memory chip could be implanted into his brain. He now can store a large amount of data right into his brain, but when the maximum capacity is exceeded, he can't keep it in his head too long, or he will die.He has been ordered to carry 320 gigabytes of crucial information from Beijing to Newark. The information has been stolen from the Pharmacom company and is the cure for NAS. Of course the corporation wants to stop him and with the help of the yakuza they try to capture him alive, because they don't want to loose the information. But then he gets help from the Low-tech group led by J-Bone. This group helps him, because they want to spread the information about the cure for free, but first they will have to try to break the missing code to download the information.Even though I'm not the biggest fan of Sci-Fi, that doesn't mean I can't enjoy it. But than it needs more than only a good story. Good acting is an absolute must as well and that's where it goes wrong. While Dolf Lundgren is very interesting and sure must have had a lot of fun as the lunatic preacher, all the other actors aren't all that great. Keanu Reeves really doesn't give away a good performance and the other actors' performances aren't really mind blowing either.In the end this is a very uninspired and disappointing movie with a very dark view on our near future. I hope it won't be the way they show it, because then I guess it would be better for us to end it all right now. I give this movie a 4/10.",Johnny Mnemonic

Having said that, this isn't a horrible movie, but it could have been so much better. Some blame Keanu Reeves, but I like him much more in this than in the overrated Matrix films. Johnny is a carrier of info. His time and mental space are purchased, and he goes and has it downloaded wherever. Only something bad happens, his release key is lost and he has a certain amount of time to get it out of his head before it goes BOOM!

31,mentalcritic,So stupid it is brilliant!,1,31 October 2006,"Having read many a review of Johnny Mnemonic on websites that concern themselves with films that are so bad they become good in an unintentional comedic sense, I knew I had to see it. And having watched it through the magic of online rental services, I was instantly floored by a howler of a stupid film. And what makes it really ironic is that the revered William Gibson not only wrote the story upon which it is based, he also wrote the screenplay. Allegedly, he also wrote a screenplay for Alien 3 that was rejected in favour of the version that appeared in theatres. Make of that what ye will. Given that no other writers are credited for this mess, it is hard to place the blame anywhere but on his shoulders. Then again, JM was the last thing Robert Longo apparently directed after an illustrious career involving two music videos and an episode of Tales From The Crypt, so I cannot say he is entirely blameless. To put it simply, this entire film smacks of everyone involved making the wrong decision at just the right moment.Kicking things off is the hilarious presentation of the story. The opening crawl is a very tricky thing to pull off, especially as it always entails comparisons with everyone's favourite episode of Star Wars. There are opening crawls that can compare well with Star Wars, but Johnny Mnemonic features one of the most poorly-presented in history. Among its cavalcade of sins is setting a specific date for the events of the story to occur. The events themselves are not entirely implausible, but in an information technology market cornered by a company interested only in repressing the product for the sake of its profit margin that said market would take two decades to recover from if it went out of business tomorrow, setting a date for the ability to carry data within a human brain as early as 2015 destroys what little believability there is. This year is less than a decade away now, and yet we are still using televisions that use a vacuum tube to project an image from one end to the other, if that tells you anything.Not helping things any are some truly hideous performances from a miscast cast. About the only actors who truly fit their roles are Dina Meyer and Dolph Lundgren, for various reasons. Dina is playing a character so generic that any woman capable of faking an epileptic fit would suit (and that is not as easy as it sounds) while Lundgren is playing a mercenary who uses his skills as a fighter, along with an unnerving self-confidence, to track down his quarry. Hardly a stretch for either actor, to be quite frank. Not to mention that anything with a curvy body or a height somewhere in the range of two metres could play these two roles adequately. Keanu Reeves seems to think the film is called Ted Carries Info In His Head, Udo Kier is totally out of his element when the film requires him to be something other than a pimp, and the extras cannot get over how ridiculous the fight sequences seem on paper. Not to mention how they seem on celluloid. And in case you have forgotten it since the last time he demonstrated this fact, Ice-T cannot act.Not helping matters any is the special effects used to realise Johnny's technological world. I realise that elaborate steps have to be taken to realise a world in which information is fought over like land and therefore human mercenaries have to transport the data within themselves, but even George Lucas has recognised at one point in his career that sometimes less is more. The Lawnmower Man had come out three years earlier and proved to the world that while feats in special effects are impressive, storytelling feats are far more so. The exact same problem exists with Johnny Mnemonic. In trying to show us a world that exists entirely within a network of computers, the film overloads the senses with images, leaving us confused when we should be able to follow the action from point A to point B. The fact that the film throws us into the deep end with regards to suspension of disbelief does not help matters. In the first five minutes we are meant to accept a world in seemingly perpetual night where not only can people have a hard disk implanted into their brain, but they can upgrade it at will for ludicrous sums of money.The miscellanea is a lot like the endless array of minor flaws in every version of Windows that adds up to one big problem. Johnny Mnemonic's best possible actor to play the titular role is relegated to playing a doctor who nudges the plot in a new misdirection. The method of resolving the story, well, it involves a dolphin with what looks like a set of headphones, virtual reality (which was pretty much abandoned as a computing concept in 1995 anyway), and a severe misunderstanding of the nature of computer virii. In fact, this last point is pretty funny in context. At several points we hear statements like ""unleash the virus"". Given that a virus in the data sense is self-replicating and designed to exploit holes in the security of systems (which exist no matter how well-designed they are), the last thing any responsible IT manager would want to do is send one into the open. Using one to attack a possible intruder in the system is somewhat like trying to kill a rabbit with a nuclear missile.For all these reasons, Johnny Mnemonic gets a one out of ten from me. If you like your films to be serious, then avoid it like the plague. If you are like me and like it when a film is so stupid its sheer genius, look no further.",Johnny Mnemonic

36,ivo-cobra8,Underrated Sci-Fi Cyberpunk decent Action Flick from the 90's,9,30 July 2015,"My review of the underrated cyberpunk film, Johnny Mnemonic(1995) starring Keanu Reeves, Dina Meyer, Ice-T, Takeshi Kitano, Denis Akiyama, Dolph Lundgren, Henry Rollins, Barbara Sukowa, and Udo Kier. Johnny Mnemonic is a 1995 American cyberpunk sci-fi action film directed by Robert Longo. It was loosely based on the short story ""Johnny Mnemonic"" by William Gibson.Keanu Reeves plays the title character, a man with a cybernetic brain implant designed to store information. The film portrays Gibson's dystopia view of the future with the world dominated by mega corporations and with strong East Asian influences. Seriously this movie kicks ass. Keanu Reeves and Dina Meyer are awesome. I love when An assassin try's to kill Johnny he aim his gun on his back and says ""Time to die"" and Johnny says ""Time"" and he switch's his watch and the bomb explodes. Dina Meyer as body guard Jane throws a grenade and kills a few assassins. Dina Meyer also co started in her latest movie in the 90's Starship Troopers unfortunately her character in that movie was killed. I really love Dolph Lundgren as Street Preacher ""It's Jesus time!"" ""HALT SINNERS!"" Dolph shows up after next 45.mins. in the movie I wish he would have showed earlier. He's acting is still pretty good. Ice-T and Udo Kier did a great performance in their roles. This movie is very underrated an solid Action flick I wish there would be more Action flick like are this today. In my opinion The Matrix and Johnny Mnemonic are my top 2 best Action Sci-fi flicks from Keanu Reeves of the 90's. Movies like are this don't exist today anymore. The film was shot on location in Canada, with Toronto and Montreal filling in for the film's Newark, New Jersey and Beijing settings. A number of local monuments, including Toronto's Union Station and Montreal's skyline and Jacques Cartier Bridge, feature prominently.The film premiered in Japan first on April 15, 1995, with a longer version (103 Min's) that is closer to the director's cut and features a previously composed score by Mychael Danna, different editing, and more scenes with Japanese star Takeshi Kitano and Dolph Lundgren notably. Val Kilmer was originally set to star, but left the project after he was offered the role of Batman in Batman Forever.The character Molly Millions, from the original story, was changed to Jane for the film. They are very similar characters except that Molly had retractable razor blades under her fingernails and augmented vision. It is believed that the change was due to the ""Molly"" character being attached to the rights for any possible future Neuromancer film adaptation.The script was rumored to have been dumped on the doorstep of Keanu Reeves' house, a tactic that piqued his interest and led to him accepting the role of Johnny.B.J. Rack, one of the producers, is still credited although he left the project due to creative differences with director Robert Longo First of all, the prologue is different and more poignant. Here it is, in this exact form:""New century. Age of terminal capitalism.The armored towers of multinational corporations rise above the ruins of the democracies that gave them birth.Soldiers of the Yakuza defend them.Hackers, data-pirates, LoTek media rebels are the enemy, burrowing like rats in the walls of cyberspace.A new plague convulses the cities: Nerve Attenuation Syndrome, incurable, fatal, epidemic, bringing fear and misery as old as the species itself.But the most precious data is sometimes entrusted to elite private agents, wet wired to function as human data banks.Mnemonic couriers.""10/10",Johnny Mnemonic

It has an interesting idea, one that maintains a good level of interest and suspense, but unfortunately doesn't stand up as much as it could due to its implementation. It might have been due to technological limitations, taking into consideration the production year, but you cannot miss the final product which simply doesn't provide a credible and truly dramatic atmosphere. The dialog also doesn't do much service to this movie, as its lack of complexity and average sound prove to be quite a letdown. In terms of plot, it is pretty coherent, but also simplistic and predictable, leaving almost no room for any interpretation. Thus, it is linear and doesn't do much to lift the quality of the movie. The actors did a decent job but also nothing out of the ordinary, while the characters portrayed are on par with the rest of the movie, being basically described and unsympathetic, their fate leaving little to care for from the viewer. Overall, it's a movie set in a futuristic world, one which could have provided a lot more, but failed to do so from every point of view. It leaves the impression that it was rushed, that it wasn't given enough time to fully accomplish what it had proposed to do, thus the result leaves much to desire.",Johnny Mnemonic

The differences will probably annoy Gibsons fans. The biggest problem is that the movie feels like a bunch of ideas thrown together with no real connection. This is a movie with Yakuza killers , fanatic priest , a data decoding dolphin; some girl's soul stuck in a corporate computer system and laser whips. Some of them are cool and work , but most of them don't work at all. The story doesn't really tell anything deep or interesting about the future world.The movie is badly directed by Robert Longo who isn't a professional director , but a painter (!). Keanu Reeves can't act and the other actors (including raper Ice-T) are on his level of bad acting. There is one surprisingly good performance here – Dolph Lundgren who plays fanatic priest. He's a colorful , funny and memorable character , even if he feels out of place here.There are some cool CGI special effects sowing ""what is going inside in the Internet"" , even if they feel pointless. The action elements are weak .I give it 2/10. Better watch ""Strange days"" instead.",Johnny Mnemonic
39,kuarinofu,I have never seen anything quite like this,5,3 August 2020,"I remember seeing parts of Johnny Mnemonic in around 1997 but I was too young of a kid (9 y. o.) to understand what was actually going on.Giving this a more mature re-watch in 2020 (almost the date of the film's setting) provoked a series of emotions that I wasn't ready for.First of all, the acting was very bizarre. Everyone was so weird in this, I'm pretty sure this was intentional, but Reeves' acting made me laugh so many times I just...wasn't prepared for that. Henry Rollins was actually great in this, and Takeshi Kitano looked like he has no idea what was going on. In some scenes it looked like some of the actors were not even in the same room.Secondly, at first the film feels like it has a very tiny budget, and it doesn't. It becomes obvious later that most of the money were spent on making some of the later sets and some of the CGI (that obviously doesn't hold today). Sometimes these cheap looks hurt the atmosphere and the overall feel of the film. It's not as cyberpunk as it could've been. Most of the music was great but it was very misused and misunderstood, looks like it was made for a dark sci-fi, but ended up in, well, Johnny Mnemonic.Thirdly, while the story was supposed to be weird and satirizing many things of the time, it really doesn't hold so well today. They filled the film with lots of technical aspects which just don't translate well and only date the film more. I understand that the short story was even older than 1995, and for something that old, their idea of cyberpunk wasn't even that bad. When thinking about their idea of cyberpunk made to life in the day, it's not even that bad.Today we have lots of cyberpunk movies and videogames (especially the upcoming Cyberpunk 2077) which work on various grounds, some depend deeply on the characters (Mute, 2018), some on the atmosphere (Upgrade, 2018, Blade Runner, 1982) some do both - Blade Runner 2049. Our perception is very different now, but I still think that this film would've worked much better if they went in either dead serious and dark, or much more relaxed, funny and satirical, but this in-between approach just doesn't work so well. Maybe the story did this better and this was a directing failure, I can't really say, but this film is not built on anything, it's not that atmospheric and there are not memorable and interesting characters or ideas.Overall, I can only say that Johnny Mnemonic is a very odd and bizarre film in almost every way, it was fun to watch only because my mind wondered on what to expect next, but in the end, the story was not good, the acting was all over the place, and the visuals didn't hold up.",Johnny Mnemonic

41,chrisbrown6453,JOHNNY MNEMONIC is a mind-numbing mess that goes nowhere fast.,4,28 May 2002,"Bad career choice for the newly bulked-up Keanu Reeves, coming off the phenomenally successful Speed. He plays the 21st-century hero of the title, who has a computer chip installed in his skull, the better to smuggle vast amounts of secret data from country to country. Coming back from Asia, he has been greatly overprogrammed and his head will surely burst if he is not downloaded in a hurry. There are, of course, numerous complications, so we are never quite sure if and when we are going to end up with a lap full of Keanu brains. Our hero, wearing a cheap white shirt with a funny collar, eventually makes it back to the desolate Free City of Newark. He is being pursued by all sorts of bad guys, who want the information in his head. Some just want his head. One of the bad guys has a weapon that could decapitate Johnny in a second. It looks like infrared dental floss, and we've already seen it work in deftly removing the arm of an opponent. Ice T and Udo Kier are in the cast, as is Dolph Lundgren, playing the villainous Street Preacher, who carries a crucifix that doubles as a stiletto. Needless to say, the technology outperforms the humans. The oddest touch is a fake-looking, all-knowing dolphin named Jones that seems to control the world from a fish tank while connected to a number of electronic devices. He's no relation to Flipper, that's obvious.",Johnny Mnemonic
42,freakfire-1,The Pre-Neo Neo,3,25 June 2008,"What can be really said about Keanu Reeves throughout his career? I can't find anything for him to be really proud about except The Matrix Trilogy. And while certainly this has many of those pre-Matrix type kernels, it just didn't go over very well.Keanu plays Johnny, a data smuggler. He loads information into his head and smuggles it. Trouble is, he loads too much into his limited capacity and has to unload it before it kills him.So Reeves goes on an adventure where he meets a woman, of course, and together with another character discover what he is smuggling and how important it is for humanity. Sounds like the Matrix? Yeah to some degrees, but this is loaded with bad directing and corny acting. I wish this did have more intense acting when it had it, but I guess that would have messed up Keanu's hair.This had some good special effects, but not much else to be proud about. Bad acting and bad script are just that. It wasn't a bottom of the barrel script, but it needed lots of improvements.Overall, this was poor. ""D""",Johnny Mnemonic
43,culwin,Good premise...,6,3 February 2001,"I guess I don't dislike this movie as much as most people.  It could have been better, but it's not that bad.

44,TheMarwood,"There's 320GB of data in Johnny's brain, but not much else.",7,30 June 2014,"This silly cluttered cyberpunk landscape is woefully dated and really just a backdrop for a man on the run picture. Like a B noir, Johnny takes a job that finds himself in over his head, where that head of his is carrying 320gb of data(!) that the Yakuza wants to tear off his shoulders. Keanu Reeves and Dina Meyer add to the cheese with their bland presence and occasionally funny/bad acting and we get some weird scenery chewing from Udo Kier and Dolph Lundgren, who is a Jesus freak bounty hunter also out for Johnny's head. Takeshi Kitano is wasted in a role that doesn't do much, except sit around waiting for others to retrieve his data and his casting seems motivated only for foreign sales. Ice-T plays the lead Lo-Tek, an anti-tech group trying to bring down the system and his role is practically the same (minus the kangaroo makeup) in his other 1995 sci-fi film Tank Girl. Even though Johnny Mnemonic is pretty damn stupid, it is entertaining no matter how misguided it may be and it is one misguided movie. There's a data decoding dolphin; some girl's soul stuck in a corporate computer system; a long and pointless opening credit scroll - since there's loads of expository dialogue explaining everything anyway; laser whips - which seems as dangerous for the user as the victim; and a trip inside the internet, complete with awesome mid 90s virtual reality effects - think Lawnmower Man fx, just slightly less embarrassing. Gibson and director Robert Longo damn the studio for re-editing the film before release, but I can't imagine this footage working no matter what was cut out or shifted around, but as it is, this is dumb pulpy fun.",Johnny Mnemonic
45,PeterRoeder,This is a very good story,7,29 January 2010,"I was born in 1976, so I sort of grew up with Wiliam Gibsons cyberpunk stories. This particular movie would maybe have benefited from being ""Neuromancer"" instead which, after all, was Gibsons big hit. It is a good story but I think all the violence and fights ruins it a bit. It is clearly inspired by ""Blade Runner"", and it is made before ""The Matrix"". Anyway, Keanu Reeves is very good in the lead role, and there are interesting parts by Udo Kier, Dolph Lundgren, Henry Rollins and Ice-T. It is a good fantasy story which anticipates some of the things that has all ready happened now in 2010, so it is highly recommended if you are a fan of the fantasy genre.",Johnny Mnemonic

I know accurate predictions of the future aren't actually the metric on which films should be judged, but with the benefit of foresight, it's hard not to see this movie as totally hilarious. Keanu is essentially a walking hard drive carrying the same amount of data that's currently on my phone's SD card. At one point he puts on a power glove and VR headgear, just to scroll through files on an over the top techno internet, illustrated through amazingly dated 90s CGI effects. Not one but two musician cameos, both playing up their public image with Ice T as street wise bad ass and Henry Rollins as angry nerd. Otherwise it's a simple, serviceable action movie. The set design is quite well done outside the graphic effects, and Keanu delivers his quintessential dead pan. Can be a good time if you're able to laugh at the silliness.",Johnny Mnemonic

48,Mitch-38,THIS MEGABITES,1,23 January 2001,"*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* This critique will be short, attempt to be creative and guaranteed painless, in other words, everything this reprehensible film was NOT. Keanu Reeves, having just hit the ground running from a hit (SPEED), crashes and burns in this turkey involving cyber information carriers in the far off future. Johnny takes on the beat-to-death cliche of a company man doing ""one last job."" He jets off to Beijing where the formula to cure a pandemic disease is downloaded into his brain. Without a doubt, the only active mind in this whole production.International baddies, in the form of (who else?) a colossal Japanese conglomerate want the data at any cost. The cliches are too many to keep up with in this badly edited fiasco. Reeves character goes strictly by the numbers formula. He starts out apathetic and self-serving. Gets a girl, and somehow a conscience. Feels bad and wants to sock it to the bad guys. (yawn). At least the special effects made up a little for the tedious acting. Reeves looks positively bored, and probably could have phoned this one in from the corner callbox.Ice-T, who seems justifiably embarrassed to be in this, is wasted as an intelligent, street smart renegade. In JOHNNY MNEMONIC, he's relegated to playing the supportive, second banana. An interesting twist, and better casting choice, would've been to star Ice-T in this vehicle. Just a thought.This two hour exercise in masochism finally concludes, when a quick thinking, telekinetic porpoise saves the day.

But there's something great about this- whether it's Keanu's performance (which sure is Generic Keanu) or Dolph Lundgren's cybernetic'd up Preist Warrior, this movie would've (and still would) be a much, much better videogame, and is cyberpunk, well not quite at it's finest (like Bladerunner) but is certainly better than the first Judge Dredd Movie.",Johnny Mnemonic
50,ivko,dude should've bought a Sandisk,6,24 January 2020,"Somewhere deep, deep down, there's the core of a good idea in this movie. Cyberpunk, before most people understood Cyberpunk. That idea of a decayed society stripped of anything joyful and replaced with cold hyper-consumerism and dehumanizing technological augmentation. A young, charismatic lead literally fighting for his humanity against that dystopian backdrop could have made a really compelling movie. But the film is weighed down by plot shortcomings and misjudgment about how technology would shape society in the future.I mean, serious misjudgment. The smart move would have been to avoid getting too detailed about how things worked, like Bladerunner, but instead they decided to try and guess about how technology would evolve, providing a bunch of specifics they hoped would make things feel authentic but instead made the film appear aged a decade after it was made. For almost every future technology idea they took a swing at they missed wildly. Images are transmitted by fax, the ""huge"" volume of data he risks his brain to store would fit on something you could buy at your local supermarket for the price of a pack of gum, and phone calls are made via television sets with not even a whisper about smartphones, which is especially galling as they were already starting to be a thing when the movie was made.But in fairness to the movie, few people guess correctly about technology decades into the future. Unfortunately, the script has serious flaws beyond dated tech. Combat scenes are confusing and poorly choreographed, so they feel unsatisfying, which is a huge issue since the action is the beating heart of the film. And the film has few surprises plot-wise since they telegraph important points well in advance of later reveals that were meant to be climactic moments. If you can't figure out what's in Johnnie's head, literally the secret at the heart of the movies plot, before the end of the first scene you aren't paying attention.It can be easy to forget the rocky beginning of Keanu's career which now has so many iconic films. as you watch the cringe-worthy scenes here. But for all that you can still see the shadow of his now considerably refined charisma at times, and a glimpse of how much better the film might have been in better hands. Not a great film, but it makes for an appetizer while you wait for him in Cyberpunk 2077.",Johnny Mnemonic

Its only loosely based on the William Gibson short story, and whilst the look of the film isn't too bad, and there are a few ok performances (eg Henry Rollins as the doc), in the main the acting is poor. The tough guys facing off don't look at all tough or intimidating just stupid; the scenes where characters are meant to be revealing their motivations just make them seem bratish and unsympathetic - even if they are meant to be anti-heroes. Other elements have been added in to make this a wider story (about a disease and its cure which could save the millions as a main story arch, and the character of a assassin Preacher) than the simpler short story, and not to its benefit. The film essentially tries to cram in too much, and is a bit of a mess as a result. Even without knowing the simplicity of the original story, this just doesn't really work.

The others just seemed to walk on set and say their lines at given times. The portrayals lacked credibility. Dina Meyer is no Milla Jovovich; she was not convincing as a bodyguard. I wouldn't have trusted the guy playing the doctor to remove a splinter much less do brain surgery. It seemed strange to see Detective Tutuola (Ice T) show up once in a while with a weird hair-do.The sets were minimal but the special effects (at times) were entrancing.

Lo Teks brought up out of the story (et al.) and located in a milieu where they could broadcast back, using technology that, by then (1995), would be familiar to filmgoers? Methinks there was more than a sly hint or two up Gibson's sleeve as towards pushing the audience a bit ""left-of-center"" and more towards a sustainable future that didn't entail asking corporations in their benevolence or governments in their competence and infinite wisdom to look after us. Radical chic don't work if it ain't ""got that swing,"" though, and this movie's a hoot and a holler (""All ...

60,GHCool,Gibson debunked: cyberpunk junk,4,3 September 2007,"In the 1980s, a writer named William Gibson wrote a short story called ""Johnny Mnemonic"" about a futuristic courier that uses his brain as an external hard drive. In 1995, following Keanu Reeves's success as an action hero in Speed and right as the start of the dot com bubble, TriStar released a film adaptation of the short story. I read the short story in freshman English class in university several years ago and saw the movie on television several more years ago.Both the film and the short story were instantly forgettable. In fact, I forgot I had even heard of Johnny Mnemonic until I popped in an old VHS copy of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (the Kenneth Branagh version) that I bought for 99 cents. They had trailers for theatrical releases that were upcoming at the time of the VHS's release. One of them was for Johnny Mnemonic.It was amazing how completely out of date almost every major idea in the film is. The story takes place sometime in the early 21st century. Johnny (Reeves) downloads important, confidential material onto his brain in Japan and is chased down and almost killed by the Yakuza (Japanese mafia) all the way to the United States. He must get to the United States in 24 hours or else his brain will die from all the excess memory stored in it or something. In order to free up space in his brain for computer data, Johnny had to dump some of the memory that was already there: his childhood memories. In the trailer, Johnny boasts that he can carry ""almost 80 gigs"" in his head. (I just bought an external hard drive the size of my wallet for about $100 that can hold 80 gigs.) There have been some technology movies that now seem a little dated (WarGames is a good example), but I can't think of anything that has been rendered utterly meaningless in such a short amount of time.

61,ejonconrad,Entertainingly awful,8,20 March 2018,"First, let me make this clear: I'm giving this good marks as a fun, B movie, NOT as quality cinema.You have to remember that William Gibson wrote novels about technology while admittedly knowing absolutely nothing about technology himself, so yes, the movie starts with an absurd premise and runs with it, but parts are at least a fun ride. First and foremost, it's fun nostalgic to catalog the ubiquitous post-apocalyptic sci-fi tropes from the era:
Rich people wear suits and live in high rises, while poor people dress in rags and wear face paint. People in between hang out in nightclubs and wear lots of makeup.Trash can fires! Lots and lots of trash can fires.There's no daytime. Everything happens at night - in every time zone.Asians run everything.Interaction with computers and the internet is done through virtual reality. Ice-T, Henry Rollins, and Dolph Lundgren give great, campy performances, while Keanu Reaves delivers a Keanu Reaves-like performance a role which was almost certainly written with Keanu Reaves in mind. There's an interesting mix of weaponry, including high-power automatic weapons, and this weird light-saber laser whip thingy that for some reason only one person gets to have. One the other hand, these are no match for cross-bows, throwing stars, and knives - and of course, there's the magic (spoiler redacted). So crack a beer, sit back, and enjoy what people once thought now would look like.",Johnny Mnemonic
62,Ken-208,Stupid Movie -- don't waste your time,2,31 October 1999,I loved the Matrix and so I rented this movie because Keanu Reeves was in it.   This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  Usually I watch a movie to the end but this is one of the few I couldn't stand.  I watched about 80 minutes of it and it kept getting worse.  It was so bad that I fast forwarded through a few sections to see if the ending justified wasting any more time -- it didn't.Probably the dumbest thing was a scene were a Keanu Reeves brain is hooked up to a dolphin to help him unload some data he has in his head.  I guess they were trying to show that dolphins were smarter than anyone else in this film.  And they were probably showing that dolphins are smarter than humans -- probably no dolphin wasted their time watching this really really really stupid movie.,Johnny Mnemonic
63,MackMonMay87,Keanu tries in a relic that won't require too much hardrive space to enjoy,6,14 December 2020,"The best sci-fi can imagine the future while commentating on the present. Watching 1995's Johnny Mnemonic in 2020 is a strange experience for sure. We have a then-future setting that's now only a month from now that depicts a global pandemic, a greater integration of technology into our daily lives, and even scenes of protests in China and Asia with people wearing masks over their faces. It's eerie to notice how many of these images, or images and ideas similar to these, actually happened this year, and what the movie gets wrong about our current times also.Johnny M features 90s-style CGI and effects that actually hold up fairly well considering the advancements that have been made since. Instead of a mundane, never-ending feed of social media posts meant to spark outrage, emotion, and deliver information without context meant to get a response, the internet is depicted as a colorful and unpredictable cyber-landscape that people can fully interact with virtually, digital highways and cities your mind flies through, with hacking and computing actions represented by digital avatars like you often see in many fictional depictions of cyberspace in the 90s.What the filmmakers couldn't have predicted is how present something like the smartphone would become, and how digitized all information would become. There's brain-computer interfaces, but physical photographs, letters, documents, and discs are still vital to the plot. Ice-T in his supporting role even has a line referencing VCRs, which would be obsolete within the space of a decade of this movie's release.Overall Johnny M has a young Keanu Reeves trying his absolute hardest to play a worldly cyber courier that gets sucked into a world of cyberpunk noir intrigue. Aside from the cyberspace sequences, the movie intelligently uses mostly practical effects and sets to tell a fairly standard yet serviceable noir story using the tropes and setting of a high-tech future. The movie has its camp and silliness in characters like Dolph Lundgren's over the top killer cyber priest, or a hyper-intelligent dolphin that dictates the strategies of a group of underground rebels.In the end, everything in the story wraps up neat and clean. It feels a little overly convenient that when Johnny retrieves the cure for the deadly pandemic sitting in his brain, he also somehow recovers the memories of his childhood. Maybe I wasn't paying close enough attention, but I didn't feel the mechanics or rules of that were as well-explained as they could've been. Compare this to only 4 years later when Keanu was in one of his biggest roles ever, The Matrix, and Johnny Mnemonic while not horrible, isn't as well remembered and groundbreaking for a reason. The Matrix might not have had some of the strangely prescient predictions Johnny M does, but amongst other things, it explained the rules of its sci-fi world very clearly, which is crucial to this genre.Johnny Mnemonic is a worthwhile watch to catch the flavor of a past-era and a fun watch for an afternoon with nothing else to do. It's not true ""bad movie"" territory, and not great either. It sits a little bit below Demolition Man for me, another future-set movie from this era with predictions about current society and an underground sect of goggle-wearing rebels (seriously, I feel like this trope was used in even more movies other than these). Hopefully our current pandemic can be cured as easily as the one in this movie.",Johnny Mnemonic
64,batzi8m1,I want my shirts pressed like they do in the Tokyo Hilton,8,3 November 1999,"Everyone I know refused to see this because they thought Keanu Reeves is a t***.  Well being the Gibson fan I am, I thought that was perfect casting - Johnny is a Tool and his speach about $2000/night hookers and pressed shirts from atop a garbage pile brought to mind Gunther Grass's Rat explaining why humans are extinct.  Dolf Lungren, giving one of his finest performances with more lines than in most of his staring roles, Ice T as a lo-tech is even better than as the fighting kangaroo with Keruac's brain in Tank Girl and Henry Rollins as a doctor are more examples of casting genius.  This movie is for fans of William Gibson's obscure Sci-Fi, it's ""Cyberpunk"" and mixes elements of the short story by the same name with elements of his groundbreaking first novel _Neuromancer_ with several new characters and plot twists that deviate enough from both stories to make it interesting while keeping the best elements: like HAL in software, the junkie dolphin and Yakuza hitmen. Lots of killer-fu, buckets-a-blood, gory death - no naked breasts. Check it out for guy's night drinking as a warmup to Blade Runner or if you get tired of seeing that or The Matrix.  Apologies to Joe Bob Briggs, but Keanu's line about hookers and pressed shirts deserves and academy award nomination for both acting and writing.

A couple of weeks later I went out to pick up a copy of this movie for myself, and ever since I've been watching it every now and then. Not every month, but at least once every 4 or 5 months. Sometimes more. There's just something about it that I like. Well, lets start from the beginning:It is the year 2021 and the world has been taken over by large coorporations that do pretty much what they want to. Most of them are out to make money, however, and will do anything to achieve that goal. One of these coorporations is PharmaCom, a coorporation that deals in medicine and exists pretty much all over the world. From Beijing to Newark. 'Johnny' is a Mnemonic courier who carries an implant in his brain which allows him to carry a large amount of data there. But when he accepts a job where he is overloaded with data, he is not only experiencing trouble with getting rid of the data, but also finds that several bounty hunters and crime organizations are after his head and the information stored within. Over 24 hours he jumps around in the city of Newark, trying to find a way to get rid of the data and the bounty hunters.A touch in this movie that many might recognize from the film 'The Matrix' is that in this movie they tend to hook themselves up to the internet, which has become a virtual reality like, àlà The Lawnmower man. But in the end of the film, Keanu's character completly hooks himself up to the internet for a short amount of time, walking around in it and controlling his actions as if he was in another world. Pretty much like he did in the Matrix. Wierd, huh?The film presents a very interesting vision of the future. Coorporations, crime syndicates, virtual-reality, futuristic weapons and the like. The sets look authentic and the look and feel of the film is top-notch. The music seems to fit the mood at all times, too, which is a big plus. The characters are likeable and unique in their own way, but with one exception. Keanu Reeves plays 'Johnny' without any life or energy put into it and delivers his lines flat and in the most boring way. His worst acting job ever? Perhaps. You could tell he didn't like this movie very much.
Overall, its a very interesting sci-fi flick which has its ups and downs. The upsides is the setting, the music, the vision of the future etc. etc. while the downsides are Keanu Reeve's acting and sometimes lack of interest in what happens next in the movie. I give it a 7/10.",Johnny Mnemonic

67,pjdickinson-27822,A terrible lead performance and script but it's not entirely bad,5,21 August 2021,It's not good either. Keanu Reeves delivers an amazingly wooden performance even for him. Most of the time it's like he's saying lines and not reacting to anything. The script is partially to blame but so is he. It is still watchable and Reeves did later find his niche as an acceptably wooden actor in the right sort of film. Without this sort of movie he wouldn't have made the leap to not unbearable that would become his trademark style. It's not a long film and it has its moments but it's all a bit meh.,Johnny Mnemonic
68,Psycho Mantis,Embarrassing sci-fi,1,28 December 2001,"Based on the comic books by William Goldman, ""Johnny Mnemonic"" takes place in 2021, when the world looks like one big trash can. The title character has a computer chip in his head, which allows him to smuggle important data there, at the expense of his childhood memories. But one time he gets information stored in his head that a big, bad corporation wants badly. So they send some goofs after Johnny to take his head off.Science-fictions always fascinates me, because they don´t certainly need a strong story to entertain. Impressive special effects might just as well do the job. But they are nowhere to be found in ""Johnny Mnemonic"", which beside disappointing effects also offers a messy script which doesn´t get anywhere. The action scenes aren´t many, and they aren´t anything to write home about either. Keanu Reeves has never been an actor who carry films on his shoulders, he needs bombastic productions like ""The Matrix"" and ""Speed"" to blend in better. Here he runs around and looks very confused, and he utters his lines with no empathy at all. Dina Meyers is pretty to look at, but she isn´t much of an actor and works much better in smaller roles, and not as the heroine. Supporting actors here are rapper Ice-T and rock star Henry Rollins, and we all know what mostly happens when artists decides to try some acting. Especially when their parts are as badly written as these. The movie´s only treat is probably Swedish muscle-man Dolph Lundgren, as a fanatic priest. Yes, his acting is as wooden as ever, but I at least found some interesting things with his character. And you can´t do anything but smile when you see Dolph trying to kill Johnny, while bawling embarrassing lines like ""Halt sinners!"" or ""Behold your Saviour!"". 1/5",Johnny Mnemonic

Johnny Mnemonic the short story was really good, but how do you take a few page story and turn it into this movie. I don't know, but somebody did. I know its a cult classic and all, and I will admit that it is an entertaining movie in parts, but some of the scenes drag on and are acted so badly that it pains me to watch it. (thank god for chapter skip) Had it been made later and in a different way, we would all be saying how it is very Matrix-esqe and how it was the greatest movie ever made. But it wasn't, and we're not. This is the type of movie you watch on USA at 3am in the morning while working the grave shift during a 12 hour work day when you WANT to go to sleep.

71,greenforest56,"Predictable, mediocre, clichés",2,22 July 2005,"I recommend you watch this on DVD as you can easily fast forward through most of its tedious predictability. The plot itself is based on the tired, well-worn Hollywood cliché of ""big, rich corporations: bad - poor ghetto dwellers: good"". The producers then add to this excitement by finding the worst acting cast money can buy. How bad? A mechanical fish that plays a bit part is one of the most engaging characters. Keanu Reeves doesn't give his best performance but, compared to the rest of the cast, you hardly notice. At least he is actually doing some acting.However, if you think Ice T is one of the great Thespians of the Modern Era, then you will be entirely satisfied with the cast.There is one predictable romance of so little passion or consequence you wonder why they bothered. There is a lot of profanity which only manages to elevate the picture from bad to worse. Like the picture, the profanity is without believable passion or artistry.This picture is not without miracles. One gentleman has several high powered bullets pass through is heart, lungs and organs and appears to die. However, a few minutes later he revives long enough to hand our hero an important message, then finally expires.

73,midnightmosesuk,A forgotten future.,6,19 September 2018,"When the whole Cyberpunk thing broke I was in my early 20's. It made a big impact on me and others like myself. This was, to us, a future that was all too horribly possible. Multinational corporations with more power than a nation and defended by private armies. Corporate executives becoming a new elite in society but who's position could change in an instant based on one bad decision. A massive divide between rich and poor being made wider day by day. And gangs of desperate people, banding together for self protection and mutual benefit.And running through it all, like the wires in a machine, the technology. The hackers and data runners, the cybernetically augmented humans being more, but somehow less, than human. And, of course, cyberspace. Never had the future seemed so exciting and so horrific before.So when Johnny Mnemonic arrived at the cinema I was really stoked about seeing it. I went into the cinema with a couple of friends and we came out again later feeling rather let down. How could it have happened? A film about Cyberpunk which William freakin' Gibson was involved with was....bad? It did little to quash my enthusiasm for the genre but I avoided seeing the film again, until tonight.It happened to be playing on the Horror channel and I couldn't sleep so I thought, why not? I was transported back back nearly 25 years as I saw things represented on the screen that I hadn't thought about in years. How quaint some of it seems now and how far we've come. The exciting high tech dystopian future never quite arrived. Some bits made it, virtual reality is finally taking off and computers are getting smarter every day. But people walking around with memory enhancing implants? No. And 80gb seems woefully unambitious, even if it can be doubled, when we now have devices capable of carrying terabytes of encrypted data.I watched it and realised exactly what I was seeing. This was the modern equivalent of a Jules Verne novel or H.G. Wells. An imaginary future that never quite was and was more of a reflection of the time that imagined it than a prediction of anything to come. The threat of unrestrained capitalism profiting at the expense of the vulnerable was there, the moral implications of man's relationship with technology. Will we become too dependent upon it, and will that doom us? Will society become better or worse under the influence of the internet? We were just realising that things were going to change drastically in the 90's, Cyberpunk reflected that.So, is Johnny Mnemonic a good film? It really isn't as bad as I remembered it. You could do a lot worse with your time and it's a decent sci-fi actioner. But, to me at least, it's an interesting historical document. A snapshot of society just before the millennium and before technology had infiltrated so many aspects of our lives. We were worried about the future. And rightly so it seems.",Johnny Mnemonic

This however, was hardly its forerunner.  It looks very good, but is slow, incoherent and unbelievable. Keanu is his cardboard self, but Dolph Lundgren is absolutely awful.  I guess producers wanted some of Lundgren's video fans to pick this up, since nobody else will.  That is unless you want to see a curious 'Matrix'-like film that even has Keanu!",Johnny Mnemonic

80,Alan One,Easy to forget. . .,3,9 December 1999,"I'm no great fan of William Gibson, but surely this movie is well below his standards.  Instead of fruitfully exploring the sometimes fascinating techno-dystopia that is Gibson's trademark, Johnny Mnemonic spares no time in boiling down to yet another chase-driven plot.It's tempting to view this film as a conceptual dry run for The Matrix.  In both, the increasingly technological context of life is seen as threatening to humanity.  Johnny Mnemonic, however, poses the conflict in significantly weaker terms.  In it, the people of the future are afflicted by epileptic seizures, which, according to a doctor in a fit of machine slapping, are caused (in some unexplained way) by the inescapable presence of electronics. But the concept falls flat: we're supposed to fear the medical effects of the encroachment of machines on our lives in the future, when the negative psychological and societal effects already seem formidable.  I mean, which idea scares you more: catching a disease from your computer or getting your brains blown out by some twitchy Quake addict because you looked at him the wrong way?The film is full of this sort of symbolism-so-plain-it-really-isn't-symbolism stuff.  The protagonist is a human data courier with a hard drive in his head.  We discover that he has jettisoned his childhood memories to make room for extra digital memory.  (I won't even speculate on how plausible a cognitive scientist might find this.)  The message, in case you missed it, is that our hero has been dehumanized by his job.  Whatever his flaws, Gibson's best stories seemed to avoid such simplistic characterization.  A strong dose of Gibson's moral ambivalence would have made Johnny Mnemonic a better film.",Johnny Mnemonic

One of my favorite characters was Dolph Lungren's street preacher, a role almost tailor-made for him to play. Keanu Reeves has more data in his cyberpunk head than he can handle, and he needs to get it out of his system before it fries him for good. Dina Meyer, now playing the paralyzed Batgirl on the WB series 'Birds of Prey' does a good job as the sexy Jane. ""Johnny Mnemonic"" is the ultimate cyberpunk/Shadowrun movie.

82,danxo,"Pretty Good Film, but has errors",7,1 June 2015,"""Johnny Mnemonic"" has its moments. It is actually pretty good. It received terrible reviews, mainly for moving too far away from original story, and film critics just hated it. Its funny at times, with comments like calling Johnny ""Just Johnny"" (by character ""spider"" played by Henry Rollins)after Johnny (Keanu Reeves)says his name is just Johnny. The data-carrying story is near OK, and the action pace is great. The film does have errors though - some pretty big ones. The writing is not very good. The year is supposed to be 2021, yet J-bone (Ice-T) tells his viewers to get all their ""VCRs"" ready.. VCRS? Really? In the year 2021? Nope. Also When Johnny is telling the Pharmakon underground that when the Data is transferred into head he tells them ""you will fax a copy to Newark"" FAX? There are no Faxes in the year 2021. The writers were using 1990s terminally. Otherwise, the film is okay, especially the action and special effects. The Japanese version is longer with more footage of actor Takeshi Kitano (character of Takahashi)as he is very popular in Japan. The Killer, (character Shinji) of the Yakusa Japanese mafia does a great job with his skills (or lack of ""english"" skills)....",Johnny Mnemonic
83,clauzy82,Brain Overload or is it a case of the NAS,5,25 July 2021,"If this film was setting out to give you the same experience of brain overload as Johnny, then it succeeded. A lot of cyber-punk doesn't translate well into film, especially if they try and cram too much tech into 90-120 mins, and this film falls victim to that.Johnny (Keanu Reeves) is a mnemonic courier, the mnemonics transport information that is uploaded into an implant in their brain. This time he has been overloaded with invaluable information with a lot of dangerous elements looking to take his head and scoop out the information for themselves including the Yakuza and the Corporations. Johnny who has been double-crossed is himself looking to get the cybernetic brain implant out of his head before the information overload kills him, well something along those lines as you are bombarded with characters (Villains), plots, subplots and tech it becomes tough to follow, or maybe it was just me.Not bad mouthing Keanu Reeves as he actually acts the part well, but his character is lame and for the lead protagonist this can make the viewing tedious at times, the addition of J-Bone (Ice-T) and the Lo-Teks doesn't help the film as they are pure cringe. Even though you are waiting for Johnny's head to explode, it's not all negative a few shinning lights keep the film flowing at times, his sidekick Jane (Dina Meyer) puts in a good performance and her character gives the duo life. The doctor Spider (Henry Rollins) is a breath of fresh air when he hits the screen but the stand-out is one of the villains (nomination for villain or character of the year) Street Preacher played by none other than Dolph Lundgren. With some other familiar names as Udo Kier, Denis Akiyama and Takeshi Kitano.The film is so-so in all, the acting, the action, the plot and the characters are all hit or miss. If you are a fan of sci-fi, cyber-punk, action or Keanu Reeves then give this a watch. It's no Minority Report, Matrix, Point Break or Total Recall but if you like those films and you're in the right frame of mind you might be able to take this on.For the fans of cheese: It's all about the Street Preacher (Dolph Lundgren) he is the essence of the melt in this movie.",Johnny Mnemonic
84,Autlan,"""If Keanu's brain was a computer, how much information do you think it could hold?""",3,25 August 2006,"What started with a salesman wickedly musing over a manhattan shared with the stranger to his right is here recognised and thoroughly explored. The frivolous or uneducated reply -- one-hundred and sixty Gigabytes -- brings into question why more of that ample brain power hasn't been put to better use in the cine-classics predating this one. Fortunately, this time, Pinocchio is intentionally typecast as someone whose mind is elsewhere.There's only one description big enough for this production and that's purposefully capitalised, ""Truly Abysmal"". Serious writers get turned off the motion picture industry for a fraction of this cruelty. It took Gibson three years in a bottle -- I'm not alleging alcoholism, just that he drifted for a while, aiming his glass bow at rocky coastlines, more than once -- to regain some courage and return to the screen. Admittedly with similar results, but comparatively unnoticed. A tattered but hardened man, he refused to be driven far and resurfaced sometime later on the boob-tube. If only the director had been that fortunate.Enough about consequences though. The basic story for those of you blissfully unaware involves the adventures of a dimwitted scarecrow who trades the majority of his already limited cranial padding for one-hundred and sixty million million eights of ones and zeroes. The idea being that transporting digital information inside your head is more secure than carrying it around on your person. Unfortunately, or maybe by good fortune, everyone seems to know where the information is hidden and they're all taking turns with the walnut crackers.Now you're thinking this sounds good. Sadly, it could have been, but this anomaly swallowed any effort or cash incentive thrown at it. Appearances by Takeshi Kitano, Dolph Lundgren, Henry Rollins, Ice-T and even a cybernetically enhanced talking dolphin all failed to save the day.

This movie does have that mid-nineties hacker movie quality about it, it focuses on a dystopian futuristic world where corporations own everything--no surprise there. What I was surprised about, though, was how underrated (again, recurring word in this thread) this movie is. I found it a decent and original piece, and surprisingly fun.

""Johnny Mnemonic"" has the unique distinction of having a rather bad first half being saved by the second half. There were moments of badly delivered lines and situations, which I fully blame the director for. There were cuts where the demeanor of Keanu Reeves changed confusingly. Again I blame the director and continuity supervisor. There was, IMHO, more gore than necessary. But that's a matter of taste. And, to make matters worse, I wasn't sure of what I was watching.There was a LOT of good things about the movie. It told a sci-fi story about a dark and bleak future....somewhat similar to ""Blade Runner"". And it did it well. There were an amazing amount of sets, extras, and really well done computer effects. There was even one really well filmed shot in a hospital that reminded me of the long scene from ""Gone With The Wind"" showing the dead and dying in the Atlanta train yard. Many of the secondary actors (especially Henry Rollins as ""Spider"" and Ice-T as ""J-Bone"") were surprisingly good and helped to raise my rating of the film from an initial 4.0 to an overall 7.0 rating.If you aren't into a lot of foul language and/or gore, I'd steer clear of this film.

88,applejosh1991,one of the best underrated films of the 90's,8,3 February 2016,"Johnny Mnemonic has probably the strangest production history i ever heard of. originally planned as a low-budget art-house film with acclaimed sci-fi writer William Gibson to write a screenplay based on his short novel by the same name and Robert Longo new york artist and painter to direct this feature despite having little to no experience with directing films. unable to get the funding but and somehow they struck a deal with sony pictures under their sister company ""Tristar"" for a budget of 30 million to make a cyberpunk action blockbuster.Gibson was forced to sacrifice his original screenplay to appeal to wider audience and changing major plot points from his novel. which ruined his reputation in Hollywood. Johnny (Keanu Reeves) is ""mnemonic courier"" data storage device implanted into his brain to carry classified or useful information for his buyers, but everything goes wrong when he makes a deal with a bodyguard agent (Udo Kier) to get an upgrade for more storage for him which later reveals that information that Johnny received links to the Yakuza's operation lead by Takahashi (Takeshi Kitano) who wants Johnny dead before they uncover the truth about a their operations related to a lethal disease that cause many deaths. the cast is surprisingly good, sure Keanu's hockey dialogue and stupid moments are here, but he's hilarious, delivering funny lines of dialogue sometimes. Dina Meyer's major film debut is probably the best actress/character in the film she's likable, bad-ass, strong female lead and helps johnny more times then the other way around which is rare for mainstream blockbusters.Legendary Japanese actor Takeshi Kitano in his only English speaking role in Hollywood feature film which is also very minor, playing the main villain, despite given very little screen-time and dialogue he's performance shows how great he is. rebel-hacker J-Bone (Ice-T) also gave a good performance an improvement in terms of his acting and let's no forget the best character of the film Karl (Dolph Lundgren) the psychotic street preacher, delivering his lines is gold mine of awesomeness. despite the criticism the film received over the years, it's not a bad science fiction film at all, i had a lot going for it. it suffered from poor direction, pacing and a lot of studio interference. the US version (97 min.) does not do the film justice at all, the out of place music, some plot points and characters development scenes have been cut, and some of the violence have trimmed for an ""R"" rating. thankfully there is a ""Japanese Cut"" (103 min.) a much better version, slightly better pacing, much better music, character development, Takeshi Kitano and Dolph Lundgren's characters scenes are restored (in the US version both are barely in the film, almost all their scenes have been cut completely despite Lundgren getting top-billing in the credits!).",Johnny Mnemonic

I just thought it was a bad choice for a title. Fastforward twenty years and I have finally gotten around to watching this film and . . . actually . . . it's NOT that bad. Of course, it's completely wrong about what the future world will look like. (It's set in 2021.) Yet, its view of the future is lushly told. Someone clearly went to a lot of trouble to make this dystopic world look real. Unfortunately, the storytelling is the problem. There's clearly so much more that could have been told in addition to the requisite running around, fighting, and shooting at people. While you can tell there's a ""story"" here, Robert Longo, the director, just doesn't tell it. This is too bad, because this movie actually tantalizes with details of relationships and other encounters that could have made it a classic sci-fi film in the vein of ""Blade Runner."" Oh, well.

90,Mansilla,Avoid at all costs - this is p*** poor.,1,25 April 1999,"Johnny Mnemonic was a dreadful film. The idea is that Keanu Reeves plays a kind of Data Courier who carries the information inside his brain, having had it transferred there by a fibre optic link.The idea is not too bad, and could make a reasonable film with a decent scriptwriter and some actors. But neither of those was in evidence. As well as Keanu we get the 'talents' of Ice-T, Henry Rollins, and Dolph Lundgren. My gods! They really went all out on the third rate actors on this one. Dolph plays Jesus, in an unintelligible move. There are also a load of Hong Kong Action people, including Takeshi Kitano, who are passable.As other users have said the computer scenes are awful. You would think Hollywood would have realised that people who are into Sci-Fi also tend to be into Computers, but evidently not.The plot is jumpy, and very difficult to follow. There are various almost totally random bits in there. Visually the film is quite nice, and I seem to remember the trailer being pretty good, but the promise was not fulfilled. It looking nice does not excuse it from its other numerous faults.This is one of only 2 films of the god-knows-how-many I have rated on here that I gave 1/10.

As always in Sci-fi movies with in a awful future, we have the hero who is figthing for justice and against the evil companies (or just the villains) that doesn't seem to have any morality or kindness in them. You can compare it to Terminator or to Alien, which both shows a future that has gone wrong.2) Like many other sci-fi movies, as The Matrix, we see high Tec equipment at the villains side, and extremely Low-Tec at the heroes side. Again, this is as every other sci-fi movie (almost) and again, there are NO new ideas to this side! 3) The characters are awful! johnny is a person that doesn't trust anyone (which is VERY ""understandable"" (if such a word exists)) but every time he doesn't want to be a part of it, he seconds later is going back TO BE a part of he good team! WHY cant we see a character who tries to be on his own, or is told (by the other ""good"" or friendly people) why they can help. The people who is supposed to help him, doesn't seem as they WANT to! Example: When Johnyy and the girl (forgot her name) is looking for ""Jones"" at the old Bridge, we see Johnny yell and Yell ""Jones"" or ""Hello!"" a lot. The strange is, the girl (who knew who Jones is) isn't helping him in any way! She just stands there, and do NOTHING to let them inside the facility!!!! Why didn't she help Johnny if she knew the area AND the people? Why did she let him stand there and yell, and let him almost die (when a car was accidentally dropped at them)? a very strange helper i must say! Dolph Lundgreen plays a very strange Christian-contract-killer, and enjoys to let his victims suffer the way Jesus did. But why do the villains hire and old, fanatic, killer and not send a elite force after johnny? In The Matrix we have the Agents as the evil ones, and NOT and old stupid religious fanatic!!! That is again making this movie so bad! And by the way: WHY DO THEY HAVE A DOLPHIN??? thats a question i cannot solve! To make the story short: The movie sucks with lousy characters, stupid plot, stupid actors and a lot of unsolved questions.If you have seen Matrix, you can clearly see some similarities!",Johnny Mnemonic
93,Playitagainsam,Cyberpunk at its best and worst,9,8 March 2006,"I must start with a personal statement - I'm amazed at the silliness of those who bombastically declare this to be the worst movie of all times and so on... Really? Is it really that bad, worse than ""Manos - The Hands of Fate"" or ""Cocoon - the Return""? I think most of the people who diss this film fall, broadly, in three large categories: 1) those who are so attached to the original short story that they can't stand the idea of an eponymous film with a different vision (although, again, its Gibson himself who penned this script!) This is not ""purism"", but acting like brats - just like those who criticized the film ""Resident Evil"" for not ""sticking closer to the original games"". 2) then, there are those who have a personal dislike for Keanu Reeves, and they follow him over the 'net, criticizing him for ""wooden acting"". It doesn't matter to them that the Johnny character is exactly what Keanu portrays - an egotistic, self-absorbed bastard, who only cares about his posh clothes, cold Mexican beer and hookers (and there are already so many out there like him, in the real world!). Then 3) there are those who are simply too stupid to actually watch what's going on on the screen, because of personal convictions, education or background (i.e. those who mention Grenpeace and anti-capitalism as if they are capital crimes, or those who think PharmaKom is a Japanese company). I was particularly amused at the user who launched a furious diatribe against the idea of the Lo-Teks being so visible in the ruined bridge, despite the fact that the only time in which they actually identify themselves as the source of anti-establishment activities is the very end, when they also announce they'll be going off the air. The list could go on. But this is supposed to be a review, not an answer to those who dislike the movie so vehemently.I believe this is *the* film which, despite its occasional artistic shortcomings, connects ""Blade Runner"" to ""The Matrix"". It was a courageous endeavour, portraying an all-too possible near future, and reminded me of another picture, similarly vilified by simpletons who couldn't see beyond the surface - ""Starship Troopers"". The sad fact is that the movie was mistreated, and what we ended by seeing on DVD in most of the world is not what the director intended. There is an alternative version (briefly mentioned on this site) which makes some significant changes, and it's available only in Japan. First of all, the prologue is different and more poignant. Here it is, in this exact form:""New century. Age of terminal capitalism.The armored towers of multinational corporations rise above the ruins of the democracies that gave them birth.Soldiers of the Yakuza defend them.Hackers, data-pirates, LoTek media rebels are the enemy, burrowing like rats in the walls of cyberspace.A new plague convulses the cities: Nerve Attenuation Syndrome, incurable, fatal, epidemic, bringing fear and misery as old as the species itself.But the most precious data is sometimes entrusted to elite private agents, wetwired to function as human data banks.Mnemonic couriers.""In this day and age, in the post-Enron, post-9/11 world, all the above doesn't seem so far-fetched anymore.The film is more somber in the Japanese version. We see more of Takahashi's inner desolation, and there are some added bits of gore and violence in the Beijing fight. Johnny himself is much more of a corporate puppet - we see it from a longer dialogue with the hooker in the hotel room, or in the scene in which he acquires the memory doubler. We see J-Bone sticking a syringe in the dolphin, sadistically commenting how the creature is a junkie.There is also more realism involved (Spoiler alert!): the hero doesn't somehow miraculously recover his childhood memories after being connected to Jones. And we see how Johnny, exhausted, decides to get it over with, despite a dire warning that the ""looping"" procedure through the dolphin will most certainly kill him. That is a moment of pure redemption, sadly lost in the official European and North-American film versions.Last but not least, the extended cut gives more screen time to Lundgren's ""mad preacher"" character. We see him sermonizing in his church, in front of a rapt audience, using words and gestures that are scarily familiar to anyone who has watched an Evangelical TV channel. He discovers along the way that Johnny's ""load"" is the miraculous cure for NAS, and he covets it for himself - he even shouts he wants to ""become (like) God."" It's easy to see why ""some circles"" decided to eliminate all this potentially uncomfortable content... but we ended up with a caricature, instead of a cunning and shrewd film villain.Johnny, we barely knew you.",Johnny Mnemonic
94,darkpatriot85,I've Seen Worse,6,26 March 2007,"For a while I thought this was along the lines of Ishtar or Gigli, but then after watching it all the way through it's not as bad as advertised. If you want to see a bad sci-fi movie, go watch Battlefield Earth, if you want to see a really good sci-fi movie then watch Stargate, if you want to see a semi-good sci-fi movie then see this or Dune.For me, I had to keep an open mind while the first twenty minutes of the film passed. The parts where I hear were the worst parts (such as the dolphin) didn't make me cringe but more of a ""Hmm, that's different"" kind of emotion.Other than what I have mentioned Johnny Mnemonic is far from Blade Runner or The Road Warrior but it is also very distant from Lawnmowerman 2.",Johnny Mnemonic
95,poxpalace,Under Rated,8,19 September 2020,"The main plot and idea was quite original when it came out and had since been used multiple times over including by Star Trek DS9. I admit the acting isn't always the best, but the sets and general speed of the movie make up for that.",Johnny Mnemonic
96,maj-solo,A innovative classic .... A must see (just so you know what you are talking about),7,31 December 2008,"You are all silly ... all of you!!! This is a great movie, a classic, just like BladeRunner.I don't understand how can anybody miss that!!! I watch this movie like 30 times each year. Easier now when computers easily hold a DVD movie.My favorite movies: Johny Mnemonic, The Right Stuff, Contact, Matrix I, Starwars II, Titanic, Alexander, Gladiator, Back Room Window, Memoirs Of A Geisha, Howard The Duck, The Hidden, Alien I, Predator, 2001 Space Odyssey, Saw IV, Gettysburg, X files series, Twin Peaks series ..... and so on But definitely this movie, might not be the greatest, but just as revolutionary as BladeRunner. And just as Bladerunner no later movie has built on the BladeRunner, Johny Mnemonic or Total Recall, or Operation Outland and so on, simply because their stories didn't allow any sequel. But still, they could have been built upon but it has not happened.I don't plan to go through all reviews, but to not give this movie more than a seven .... it just proves how lost some people are and that they don't get that jolt, kick, or whatever that tells them this movie is special. In fact the movie is very special, innovative, and just glimmers there all alone by itself on the movie star sky .....Also, some people don't like Reeves acting. Well, I think it worked well even if he was into this movie or not. Johny had to remove ""a chunk of long term memory"" ... ""a chunk of what?"" .... ""my childhood"" ... ""your childhood?!?"" ... ""what a weird ass thing to do!""... ""I needed the space for the job"".... Simply, Johnny is depressed. Removing such a big part of your identity, the foundation of your identity should make your soul hollow, should cause psychological problems. And the mess he ends up in this movie he is simply very frustrated. He is also a very intelligent very focused computer hacker and that is probably why he don't break down completely and sit down crying. The frustration and the anger is whats left that drives him. In any way he is easily irritated.He probably is paid extremely well, but because of the psychological problems, and even social problems (since he don't remember his family,childhood, friends, just a big hole there), make him addicted to drugs which is often the case. And drugs can be of any type, alcohol, narcotics, shopping, distract you with computer games, gambling, hookers, clothes. So he earn a lot but probably burns the money just as fast.So I am sorry for those who didn't get a character to identify with, or someone who is pretty and glowing and vibrant. Instead you got this angry introvert shallow self absorbed depressed character on screen. Reeves acting, intensional or not, and the story, worked well together.It may be low budget, I don't know, but it sure is special. I am a Johny Mnemonic Junkie .... if that has escaped anybody .....Also I don't rate movies after their budget or visual effects, I always look between the lines and fill in the gaps myself ... and that is why books are the best and why you usually get irritated when you watch movies made from books. If the book was great the movie can only fail. But by working on the story and make changes you can make bad books great as movies. movies are for people who are lazy and I am lazy.",Johnny Mnemonic
97,rodental,One of those films that could (and should) have been better.,5,24 May 2003,"All things considered, this film probably does exactly what it sets out to do. Unfortunately the people behind it set their sights too low. There is so much movie-making potential in Gibsons writing, that this film could very easily have been both entertaining AND carried the depth of his literature. I was left with the feeling that Gibson thought: -""Well, this is going to be my one chance at getting my work on the big screen. So I'd better stick a little bit of everything I've made in it."" Too many of the characters taken from his fiction get mistreated by the script: Ralfi, Molly Millions, the-guy-with-the-monowire-thumb, Johnny. Whereas the new ones, like Spider and the Street Preacher are much more entertaining. For example: One of the central ideas in the short story was that Johnny is ""a very technical boy"" - totally reliant on technology - and therefore actually needs Molly's muscle-power to protect him. Aside from one initial rescue, Johnny actually saves his own bodyguard more times than she helps him (with anything!) Maybe Keanu has a ""Heroism Clause"" of his own, like Kevin Kostner... :) A pleasant surprise though, was the appearance of Takeshi Kitano (even if it was a small part.)My favourite scene is Johnnys rant on the rubbish heap. I know it is contrary to the intent of the scene, but I sympathise completely with his feelings. He had sacrificed something that most people hold sacred, in order to live a certain lifestyle, and it gets taken away from him completely undeservedly - no wonder he feels cheated.If you really want Gibsonesque cyberpunk, go for _New Rose Hotel (1998) _ instead.",Johnny Mnemonic
98,emaan,The computer graphics stole the show,3,14 September 1999,"I can't say how disappointed I was when I stepped out of the cinema. I had higher hopes for director Robert Longo, especially since I was a fan of his avant garde video efforts for techno music pioneers New Order.Basically the original Will Gibson story was stripped of most of its vital human dimension and given over to actors who didn't understand what cyberpunk was about. Even badass Ice-T who usually drips with attitude was wearing the wrong emotional wardrobe.From the looks of the pitiful sets it seems the producers forked over so much of their capital to the CG houses that they couldn't built any really interesting places that were true to the settings in the novella.Where was the Low-Tec killing arena with the dancing floors? And most of all, where was Molly the ice-cold assassin who's supposed to have saved mister ""Ultimate Hard Drive's"" butt? All we got was a whiney, frazzled looking and helpless dame in distress.Commendable ONLY for it's impressive computer graphics work from Sony Imageworks (among others) that still rivals some aspects of The Fifth Element. I guess The Matrix did it better... a lot better. *sigh*",Johnny Mnemonic
99,spamflux,One crappy movie.,1,4 September 1999,"Before I comment, I have to comment on the users who wrote that you have to check your brain and enjoy watching the movie, or just watch the movie for action and not the story line or actual character developement. And I'm sure they would point out to me that I shouldn't be critical of this film when I wasted 1 hour and 45 minutes hoping it would have alot of sci-fi action, I know whose got the higher IQ. I expected the usual sci fi action in this movie after renting it from Blockbuster, and it did say sci fi action on the vhs tape as well. However during the movie, I noted that the characters are like a bunch of stick figures just waiting for some cue man to tell them what to do next. Everyone acted so freaken stupid in the movie, and most notably Keanu Reeves p**s poor acting, The Matrix made him look really good with the fighting. Peace I gave this movie rating a 1.",Johnny Mnemonic
100,grayure,Collapse of the American Dream,5,19 December 2008,"One of the most telling things about this film is its depiction of North America and the Sprawl. I've always thought of the Sprawl as being part of a single country, rather like MegaCity One in Judge Dredd, but since part of it is referred to here as a ""free city"", clearly it has now become city states, leading one to speculate on the fate of the US. This is key to Gibson's vision of a failed American dream.The atmosphere of the film itself hearkens back to Bladerunner and Mad Max in that something has failed and the future is old. It differs markedly from Mad Max, however, in its level of technology. The other, really big thing about it is its iconic depiction of the internet of the 2020s which occurs about half way through. I think all of us who have been influenced by Gibson's work, and since we're here on IMDb that does literally mean _all_ of us, would recognise this depiction. It's exactly as i imagined it in 1982 when i read ""Burning Chrome"" when it was first published.Johnny himself is played vacuously by Reeves. Whether this is intentional, it works on the grounds that he has no past, making him shallow, a detail borrowed from Philip K. Dick rather than the original story, but it works.One thing which doesn't work is Jones, but it's hard to see how that could have been done well and, ironically, that probably works better in print than in any other medium.Rather too much action for my cerebral tastes, but a good effort which is quite seminal and, oddly, early cyberpunk in cinema after the end of cyberpunk in written SF.",Johnny Mnemonic
101,eroblesp,Garbage,1,21 October 2005,"I agree with all reviewers that think this move is awful. My two cents : from all the things they ruined from the original story, I cannot forgive the two characters that made the William Gibson short story a showcase of the cyberpunk universe : Molly! instead of the ultra-cool and lethal street samurai, with surgically implanted lenses and other gadgets, we get a common hysterical and drooling mess. The other is the Yakuza assassin : instead of the quiet, polite, cloned (and VERY lethal) ninja, we get a common karate thug. I don't understand why they mixed elements from several Gibson books, only to get a confusing mix. The bridge converted to a outcast-city is taken from Virtual Light, the cyberspace run is taken from Neuromancer, it is no mentioned in the original story. Johnny is only a data storage device, he was never a hacker.Avoid at all costs and read ""Burning Chrome"" instead (for the original short story).",Johnny Mnemonic

We all laughed thru the entire movie .... it is HYSTERICAL! The whole movie is like watching a parody of other really bad movies! It is worse than the Saturday Afternoon Kungfu Theater style movie where the voices do not like up with the actors words!

103,aballyTKD,Really disappointing effort!,2,9 November 2013,"Admittedly after having read the short story of the same name along with a number of William Gibson's other books I approached this film with some preconceptions which I'd resolved to shelve and actively ignore if possible. I think I did this reasonably well.The reason I give this film three stars is because it is a bad film even by the rather dubious standards of the action genre in the 90s.The Jane/Molly character is just plain irritating and seems to be suffering from some sort of meth-created paranoid funk most of the time - certainly not somebody who would inspire confidence as a cool-as-ice razor-girl bodyguard. Keanu Reeves, who I generally like despite his limited acting range, is unusually wooden and seems to be going through the motions for a big fat pay cheque both on and off screen. The rest of the cast turn in performances fit for a straight-to-video/TV movie directed by teens. The only exception is Udo Kier as Ralfi who is typically convincing as a sinister Peter Lorre like fence\agent\pimp because of his appearance.I was inspired to watch the DVD on the basis of other reviews which suggested 'tweren't too bad. Maybe if you haven't read the story, it's tolerable as a piece of rainy day, diversionary drivel. Otherwise approach with extreme caution.",Johnny Mnemonic

By and large, it is really bad. I like Keanu Reeves a lot; his limited acting abilities make him paradoxically a great hero (as in ""Speed"" and ""Matrix""). One really wants to believe in him, but here he is acting against his clothes: somehow the suit does not match the shirt collar, and the collar is too narrow for the tie, and the suit hangs rather than sits. And someone gave him a terrible haircut. I am always amazed that actors survive this sort of nonsense, so well done, Keanu!",Johnny Mnemonic

Geesh. The concept/storyline is good, the acting? Not so much. Some scenes are 'groan worthy'. Keanu Reeves is still relatively young in this. What blew me away is the relation to what happened in the movie to what is happening now in the world (2020/2021) regarding an illness/cure vs virus/vaccine and the fact that the movie takes place in 2021.

I could not believe how bad it was.The story was good enough. I mean, seriously. Its an action movie. What can you expect? The movie had potential, but whoever wrote the dialogue is the worst writer in history. It actually seems to me like the person who wrote the dialogue didn't speak english, and had someone translate the script for him after he was finished writing it. I can't even describe it. Don't watch this movie if you're looking for quality filmmaking.The action sequences were super-cheesy. The dialogue was awful. And can someone tell me - what did the filmmakers think was so cool about a laser-string that you can cut people up with? It's the gayest weapon ever. The script tried really hard to be emotional, and failed. It tried to make the bad guys out to be bad-a*ses, but they came across as moronic cartoonish villans. There was no character development at all. Johnney and his bodyguard go from arguing a lot and not being friendly at all to making out. It was that sudden. It was like 'Woah.

113,damalfieri,"Haha,,,",6,9 September 2009,"Again, how many people saying this is such a bad movie... I haven't read all the messages, of curse, but I read nothing about the art direction. A great work, for a commercial - standard movie, in creating a barroque and decadent future - yes, it was many years after Blade Runner, but still, all the secondary characters, veichles, extras etc. were built with care (in art-direction terms)... a lot of work. Not a very low budget movie, and if it is, well, I would say ""well done"". Computer fantasy are dull, OK. But the premonition of a virtual-reality based computer is OK, in itself. The final virtual battle is just a bubble of visual effects, but... everyone I saw are. As in many science-fiction movies, one knows that ""in the book, there were much more things"". But it happens to most movies: The Lord of the Rings in the first place. And Star Wars, despite all, is just a very simple story, remade from a lot more (ah, how I would like an Asimov's Empire movie!). And few say they are bad because of that. Here comes the spoiler: Johnny recovers his childhood memories at the end, and someone asked how could it be. It is funny. When I first saw the movie, I assumed that he was the son of the corporation's founder, the woman that was ""in the computer"", that helps him to decode the information providing the missing image. This is a normal filmic way to express things: when possible, use visual instead of dialog. So, in the process, she ""dies"" but gives Johnny his childhood memories (he is shown to be born in a very, very rich family, with a blonde mother that could very well be this woman). Now, the funny thing is maybe it is NOT the author's idea, but it gives coherence to the entire film. The problem is nobody / nothing confirms this. But it is so common to see how movies don't ""explain"" things, that it didn't surprise me. I just enjoyed the right dose of originality, action, and, yes, Reeves' acting. People who criticize him don't take into account the crisis under the bridge, that was at least OK, and, on the contrary, don't mention the movements he makes in order to re asset himself after the overload, in the very beginning... that can be easily seen as ridiculous. As an actor, to perform such ""ta-chi like"" movements is a risk, and I respect that (even if them DID seem kind of ridiculous to me!).By the other side, we admired a lot of ""stone face"" characters, like Reno in his wonderful ""the assassin"", to mention a single example among thousands, without complaining...

Nope, they stick some random T&A in it called 'Jane', what's that about?They stick a load of stuff that didn't happen in the short story in it, take out a lot of what happened in the short story out, and we have a different film by the same name.Rent 'Strange Days' instead, it's the film that 'Johnny Mnemonic' should have been. It's not the Gibson plot, but then neither is this movie.

The implant is too large and Johnny only has a couple of days to get it out. Unfortunately, the Yakuza (Japanese Mafia) are after the information in his head. Although the plot is somewhat odd and there are many really stupid scenes, it does not hide how expertly they portray a post-apocalyptic world. Don't see it for plot, see it for the action.",Johnny Mnemonic
118,jesper_sommer,A must-see for the sci-fi fan !,10,7 May 2001,"The first real cyber-punk movie ever with commercial success. The movie is certainly NOT full of clichés, since it is the first of its kind - a trend-setter for all cyber-punk movies to come. Although the manuscript could benefit from a few extra hours of work, the movie itself and the concept behind it, is the perfect school for Keanu Reeves to learn his role as ""Neo"" in ""The Matrix"". Set your mind free, and allow your imagination to take over... just for a little while. This movie is certainly no less realistic than ""The Matrix"", and a `must-see' for any science fiction fan !!!",Johnny Mnemonic
119,FranklinsTower,Matrix prequel?,2,3 July 2006,"This is a bad movie. The screenplay and direction are horrible. Note that, according to IMDb, this is the only screenplay work that Gibson has done and the last film (thankfully) that Longo directed. There is barely any character development. The action scenes are miserable; the scenes where Johnny gets angry are highly exaggerated; there are few, if any closeups or alternate camera angles -- it just feels like rank amateurs made this film, and on a shoestring budget too.Why see this movie? There are some neat concepts and a cool computer scene. Readers of Larry Niven's ""Ringworld"" get to see a ""monofilament"" wire in action (a single-molecule wire that's incredibly strong and slices through anything). The computer scene features 3D goggles and data gloves with a neat graphical user interface. The computer graphics in the rest of the film, however, reminded me of Tron.Another reason to see Mnemonic is that there are some parallels to The Matrix, a film in which Keanu Reaves stars four years later. Both take place in a dark, futuristic world, with the protagonist holding the key to save humanity. The opening scene is almost a direct match with a scene in the Matrix: Johnny's computer wakes him up. Johnny has a device in his head which he uses to ""jack in"" to a computer system to upload / download data. There's an iconoclast leader of the underworld resistance that helps Johnny fight the ""powers that be."" Finally, the most striking visual parallel may be the character ""Jones,"" who lives in a tank and is permanently connected to a computer, just like the people in The Matrix before they eat the red pill.If you like this sort of genre (dark, oppressive futures where people struggle against powerful forces who treat them like chattel), you'll probably like Soylent Green more than this film.",Johnny Mnemonic
120,frankbj,Precursor for the Matrix with bad acting,3,24 May 2003,"This movie looked interesting in the TV programme, but I was utterly disappointed by the bad acting and the incoherent plot line, especially the illogical motives of the characters.The environment is a dark and gloomy future, with some cyberspace scenes. They are generally well made. As usual as a techie, I have some objections against what will never be possible, but this is not as bad as some I have seen, perhaps owing to that the original author knows his technology.I gave it a 3/10.",Johnny Mnemonic
121,flibs,Terrible,3,11 October 2003,"This could have been a good movie.  The story line is reasonable, but much better use of it could have been made.The 'technology' depicted in the film is laughable.Keanu Reeve's acting is awful.  Thank god he learned to act before starring in The Matrix.  His bad acting isn't offset by the bad acting of his co actors.",Johnny Mnemonic

I cannot, in clear conscience, tell you to watch this movie unless you go out and read the works of William Gibson first.",Johnny Mnemonic

125,MarkoSchuetz,Very good cyberpunk movie,9,5 March 2010,I saw it shortly after it was released and I really liked it. At the time I had read several cyberpunk novels including some by William Gibson and to me. the movie seemed to capture the atmosphere of some of the novels very well. I found young Keanu Reeves highly credible as a surgically enhanced human (he'd be credible as a projection of artificial life...).I enjoyed the movie a lot and to this day I think it is a great adaptation of a cyberpunk novel to cinema. I did not give it a 10 because at times it seems too slavishly following the book and some reinterpretations for cinema might have benefited the movie.I have watched it maybe every 5 years since it was released and liked it a lot every time.,Johnny Mnemonic
126,pberghuis,Classic Cyber-Punk,4,23 October 2004,"You know, I may give this movie a 4, but I really suggest you watch it and I have to admit that I own it. This is a classic example of the cyber-punk genre, and this is one of those movies that is so bad it's good. This movie is like ""Blade Runner""'s fat slutty sister. It has everything, bright neon lights, a huge corporate society run with the help of the yakuza, and a group of rejects who neglect technology and help save the day. Some of the other things in the movie are just hilarious. Who do you call on to take out Keanu Reeve's when the going gets tough? They called on some badass agents in ""The Matrix"" but in ""Johnny Mnemonic""? A bionic street-preacher/mercenary who hands out sermons while he is busy crucifying his victims.",Johnny Mnemonic
127,laureanogomez,"Shadowrun, Cyberpunk and all of look alike",6,25 July 2005,"When this movie first came out to my acknowledged i didn't see it all. At that time, i was heavy involved in cyberpunk movement and i was an avid player of shadowrun (sorry, in my country you couldn't get cyberpunk rpg-just shadowrun). So I loved this movie. I always complained playing shadowrun that why on gods earth the game has magic and demi(semi)humans in the future? Well in the movie they just keep the tribal aspects. I loved this movie even i didn't watch it complete. Soon, a kind of popular movie appear on theaters everywhere. Some film with Keanu called the matrix. But in the cyberpunk movement the matrix is the evolution of internet so i was kind of ""why the bleep the Hollywood people throw away the good stuff like cyberpunk and make bad movies that don't follow the rules established. So i never when to see the matrix. Years later, I was a grown up adult with a clean head and the capacity of criticize objectively the things. So I saw both films, and let me tell you, i give a nice 6 out of 10 to johnny, just because it makes a beautiful collage of cyberpunk concepts. But, even being a Keanu fan, the acting is poor (i want room service (?))and the story was good when it was released but it lacks validity even in 1995. If you like cyberpunk, and related, take a peek. Otherwise, it's probably not worth the time.",Johnny Mnemonic
128,Ak3ndah,"Still timely, yet utterly villainizing",4,11 July 2021,"From the concept of sending information packets around through digital means to the borefest that is that obsession the western imperial forces have with always demonizing and villainizing others especially immigrants. This movie didn't chose a different path in regards to the expected moves of imperialists. Making the Yakuza and poorer Guerilla anticapitalist crews into your movie's baddies is too tried and tired because it derives power from turning others into a caricatures while removing the onus off the corporations or in this movie's case, inflicting more pain on the Russian religious extremist (mind you, they're a symptom of the system but was used for violent effect to which the viewer can place their ill received rage on the ""oh so bad crazy Russian"") by having them (TW), electrocuted and burned alive then tossed in a river when the sources of their pain was the imperialist corporations allowed to exist by way of corrupted government. Anyway, Keanu was okay in this movie, he really tried his best but this script seemed like a tool for anti-Asian sentiment (any time Asian culture was presented was through the antagonist lense). Ice T as the revolutionary to the Guerilla crew from ""the heaven"" was an awesome take on words because of the lack of blackness in many of our religions so to place these in a movie so far back I do give it kudos to that.On the topic of using other's image in order to create faux ""boogey people"", they seem to also do the same for people with disabilities. As with many of these so called science fiction futurist films they always seem to be devoid of disabled community input as seen by how much is allowed to be shot in film.I did love the graphics that showed transitional periods between their actual reality and the one where the transferring of the packets was taking place. It felt like one of my favorite 1990s-2000s tech magazines in the video format. No complaints on that.Overall, I did enjoy the initial narrative of being able to send and receive compressed packets of data in biological form for the purpose of say, search and rescue or other emergency situations requiring that communication. But this movie took the first bit of that and turned it into something a bit less useful when it decided to tell its stories by, as me and my fellow blacks say in the hood, cutting ass on folks for their culture and appearance. The movie used black folks revolutionary image for the white savior to plow through the angry Asians and angry Russian (everyone's anger seems misplaced except the white savior). Black folks and their allies after saving the day then are placed back in the background to give platform back to the white savior trope. I think we've all seen these movies before. It was an interesting ride though.",Johnny Mnemonic
129,bbgrlshock44,"A truly AMAZINGLY BAD film, props to everyone involved.",1,8 October 2006,"Keanu Reeves acting performance in this film was one of the worst ever in Hollywood HISTORY.This mindblowingly, disastrous film combines horrendous acting, horrible directing, horrible dialogue, horrible EVERYTHING. Johnny Mnemonic is worse than a B-movie. I remember wanting to see this in the theaters when I was a kid, I probably would have liked it back then. Having seen this recently, how was this even released in the theaters?I'm a fan of cheesy movie (and the early 90's was filled with cheese) so I was able to sit through this...I did enjoy it somewhat thanks to it being unintentionally funny. Let's not kid ourselves though--Johnny Mnemonic is one of THE worst movies of the 90's. Batman and Robin has company.btw, Ice-T is truly a no-talent a$$clown.",Johnny Mnemonic

133,Kzug,"If you thought ""Hackers"" was a pile of poop, you're in for a real feast here.",1,23 June 2004,"This movie is honestly the worst movie I've seen all year. It features all the futuristic crap you'd expect from an ""Internet movie"". If you thought ""Hackers"" was a pile of poop with all its cyber-space mumbo jumbo, you're in for a real feast here.First of all, Keanu can't act. He's quite possibly the worst popular actor of our time. We all agree on this. It also has horrible and too long and boring computer animations of what goes on ""inside the Internet"", and an arguably ridiculous plot where the hero must upload twice his capacity into his brain in order to afford to get his childhood memories back. Wow!I might've rated this movie a 0 if it was possible, but a scene including a dead guy near the end made me smile, earning it a single point from me!1/10",Johnny Mnemonic
134,pas_si_simple,Not THAT bad.,7,13 June 2003,"Johnny Mnemonic isn't that bad.  Sure, I was 13 when I really liked this film and watched it whenever it was on USA (a cable channel) in the afternoon during my summer vacays--but this movie isn't so bad that it would make people cry our pain.  I've seen worse, and I've seen a lot better than Johnny Mnemonic.  I think that, at the time, Johnny Mnemonic was an interesting film.  It had an anti-corporate message, love conquers all, and anti-hero themes... sure these are always the themes being rehashed now, but I thought it really worked in this movie.  The major thing to change would be Keanu Reeves.  That guy cannot act, and he was all wrong for this movie... 'whoa' just doesn't cut it.Plus, I liked how they would introduce the different subcultures of Johnny's world.  I thought that was tops and gave you information that helped in the understanding of the environment where this story is taking place.  Sure, it was a wee bit unorganized, but if you really just sat down and let it soak in (which I had a lot of time to do during the lazy afternoon in the summers when I was a tween) those little details really add to the world where Johnny and Jane live.I can't believe that ppl recommended Strange Days over Johnny Mnemonic... at least Johnny Mnemonic had a story that relatively held together as the film progresses and an ending that didn't seem forced.  As a 13 year old who was getting to know what Cyberpunk was, Johnny Mnemonic was a great film (of course, at the same time I thought Tank Girl was off the hook too.huy :P). I suppose people will either hate it or like it.  I just can't see why people hate it with such a passion that they have to flame on IMDb.",Johnny Mnemonic
135,Sempai1,The closest to a Shadowrun movie I've seen so far.,8,4 August 2004,"I just saw Johnny Mnemonic for the first time and I have to say I liked it a lot. The story is compelling, the action is good and the effects are still enjoyable.But what makes it even better is that it captures wonderfully the atmosphere of the pen&paper-Rpg Shadowrun. The only thing that's missing are the trolls, orcs, dwarfs etc.Even the energy-whip seems to come straight from Seattle 2060.Somebody who does not like Shadowrun might not get as much out of the film but it's still very good. Keanu Reeves does a good enough job and Udo Kier is excellent as usual, being the only legitimate replacement for Peter Lorre. All in all a lot of fun, 8/10 from me.",Johnny Mnemonic
136,serenajanepersonal,I expected this movie to be terrible... It isn't.,7,19 June 2016,"OK, by no means is this movie perfect, but it's not the sh*t show people make it out to be. I watched Johnny Mnemonic for the first time a week ago, and I loved it. The beginning is a bit rough, some of the actors with small roles did over-sell their reactions, but those with the bigger roles did a decent job. Keanu isn't an amazing actor, and his performance in this movie isn't stellar, but it's just enough. It has a great story and original concept . The humour in this movie is bizarre, weirdo, and sometimes just plain silly, but it works. Keanu and Dina had great chemistry in this movie, I really enjoyed watching them together. This is one of those movies that gets better over time; the 90s look and feel made me warm and fuzzy on the inside... Don't tell me didn't make you feel some type of way. TL;DR It's not a bad movie. It has some flaws, but none major. Big role actors/actors played their parts well (even Keanu Reeves, who was nominated for a Razzie). Awesome story and original concept. Weird and bizarre, but great humour. Nostalgic as f*ck.",Johnny Mnemonic
137,jonathanasmall,An odd collection of actors,5,16 January 2006,"Sort of Mad Max/Matrix hybrid. Not a bad film for the genre, but the thing that might catch your eye is Takeshi (the chief bad guy), who is none other than the host for Most Extreme Elimination Challenge (MXC), as well as musicians Ice-T and Henry Rollins! The edited (TV) version misses a few gruesome scenes, and indeed the film is a bit on the graphic side. The premise, about a guy who can smuggle information downloaded into his noggin, is a bit of a stretch, and the references to his storage capacity date the film (given that an iPOD Nano holds more these days). However, Keneau Reeves is a god fit for the mostly mono-syllabic protagonist.",Johnny Mnemonic
138,JellalSlayer,V? Never heard of her.,7,23 December 2020,"First of all, a bit of a personal message: I first ran across this movie in a review of Cyberpunk 2077, where the critic said the game's story reminds him of this movie. After playing the game, and watching the movie for myself, I have to say - Yes there are a lot of similarities. It's clear CDPR took a lot of ideas from Johnny Mnemonic, such as the chip in one's head killing them overtime. And the news anchorman in the car radio reporting on scientists wiring up a dolphin might have been a reference to this movie as well. That being said, I wouldn't call that game a copy of this movie, more so the continuation of the same ideas / concepts. Which, god knows, this movie needed. There is only so much you can show in a feature length movie.
Now, onto the movie itself - For it's length and budget, it grasps the themes and vibe of cyberpunk fiction, even if it can't utilize all of it. The story in itself is very promising, and if someone would sit down and reimagine / remake this movie today, with modern technology (like how CDPR tried) it'd be a much larger success. The problem here aren't the themes, the writing or the acting in themselves - These were great, but I still had a hard time taking this movie serious. And not just because it sets in January of 2021 (3 weeks from me writing this review), but because of how insanely over the top and honestly deranged this movie can be at times. I know, it's almost a trademark of both Cyberpunk fiction and the late 90s, but there were scenes especially those with Street Preacher in it that honestly reminded me more of The Fifth Element than Bladerunner or Ghost in the Shell.
Is it a bad movie? No, more so an insane one.
Is it a Sci Fi Masterpiece? No. But still pretty entertaining. Especially if you just roll with it, and don't take it seriously.
Would recommend if you love the Cyberpunk genre or over the top fiction.",Johnny Mnemonic
