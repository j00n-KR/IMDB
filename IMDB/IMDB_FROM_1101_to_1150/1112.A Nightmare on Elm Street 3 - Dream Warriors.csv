0,TheLittleSongbird,Dreams and nightmares,8,30 December 2017,"The original 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' is still to me one of the scariest and best horror films there is, as well as a truly great film in its own right and introduced us to one of the genre's most iconic villains in Freddy Krueger. It is always difficult to do a sequel that lives up to a film as good as 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' let alone one to be on the same level.'A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors' has often been touted as the best 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' sequel (or one of them) and one of the best of the series. Couldn't agree more with this. For me it is the best sequel, and while it is not quite in the same level as the original it is the closest the follow-ups get to having what made the original the classic that it is and is much better than the second film. 'Dream Warriors' may not be perfect. Maybe it could have done with having a few less characters, Neil could have been more interesting and stronger developed, and the support acting is variable though none terrible.However, Heather Langenkamp fills her role very well and Robert Englund is terrifying once more as Freddy (cannot imagine anybody else). Chuck Russell's direction is some of the best of the series in by far the best directed sequel. He is not afraid to stretch genre boundaries and does it in a way that feels fresh, a lot of it is remarkably imaginative for an 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' sequel and the execution is great.As are the special effects, particularly the snake and the TV set, the darkly comic humour with cracking one-liners and the truly frightening scares with the marionette scene being one of the highlights of the series.Very little is shoddy in the production values, the production design being both dream-like and nightmarish and the photography is stylish. The music looms ominously, while the Edgar Allan Poe quote and the Ray Harryhausen montage are inspired touches.In summary, very well executed and the best of the sequels. 8/10 Bethany Cox",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
1,Leofwine_draca,Imaginative attempt at a sequel; both different and the same,6,5 September 2016,"The third entry in the Freddy Krueger series still manages to walk the fine line between comedy and horror and pull it off successfully in what is a fun but rather formulaic movie, typical of the late '80s teen horror in that it features lots of cheesy action and close scrapes with the killer, some goofy but amusing one-liners on the part of the villain, and lots of gooey and impressive special effects, with Kevin Yagher and Doug Beswick teaming up to deliver a range of imaginative and often stunning creations for the film. The casting is pretty good too, packed as it is with familiar faces and welcome returns from the first episode in the series (incidentally the first sequel is totally ignored for this one). The setting for the film this time around is a dark and creepy mental asylum in which an assorted bunch of teenage clichés (including the swearing streetwise black guy, the nerdish Dungeons & Dragons player, the scared mute kid, and the pretty blonde victim) find themselves picked off one by one by the killer with steel claws.What this means is that there's a series of staged deaths for the teenagers in gory and usually spectacular ways, followed by retaliation and an overdone conclusion. The film really benefits from the atmospheric and creepy nightmare sequences which highlight some great moments, including my favourite in which Freddy is revealed as a huge, slimy Lovecraftian worm creature who then proceeds to half eat one of the heroines! A later moment involving one sleepwalking boy being used as a puppet with his veins for strings is memorably grotesque, whilst a buxom stripping nurse fantasy turns into a literal descent into the pits of Hell for one victim! The film also benefits from some surprising use of stop-motion animation, including the best skeleton fight seen on film since JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS! To make things even cooler, the man fighting the skeleton is none other than genre icon John Saxon, returning from A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. John Saxon + stop-motion skeletons = a darned good time in this viewer's book.Also returning from the first film is Heather Langenkamp giving a fairly matter-of-fact performance as grown-up warrior Nancy, although fans of her in the first will be disappointed that she lacks the same bite this time around. Patricia Arquette does kooky and disturbed very well indeed but her character is somewhat underdeveloped. There's also a key role for the underrated Craig Wasson as an investigating doctor who proves to be a little bit more open-minded than most. Other familiar faces include Laurence Fishburne (still 'Larry') as a hospital orderly and Zsa Zsa Gabor in a hilarious cameo appearance, playing herself as an interviewee who gets attacked by Krueger! Robert Englund returns to his most famous role and once again invests it with a pleasing level of dynamism and enthusiasm. Not to be described as a great film, this is however a good attempt at a much-maligned genre movie and quite watchable. The series went notably downhill from here.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
2,SnoopyStyle,good recovery after inferior second movie,6,13 December 2014,"It's six years after the original movie. Kristen Parker (Patricia Arquette) has been having awful dreams about Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund). Her mom thinks she attempted suicide and sends her to the Westin Hills Psychiatric Hospital. Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) is the new intern at the hospital. Neil Gordon (Craig Wasson) is the doctor in charge of the kids. The kids all dream about Freddy Krueger and Kristen has the ability to pull others into her dream. Laurence Fishburne has a smaller role as an orderly.The franchise is revived after the inferior second movie. Nancy is back and so is Wes Craven. The kids are interesting and so are the kills. There is actually a plot. Patricia Arquette has a nice central role. The pacing is a bit slow at times and the production is still a bit lower grade. Nevertheless, it is really nice to have Nancy there to tie it back to the original.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
3,claudio_carvalho,My Favorite Sequel,8,30 March 2009,"When the teenager Kristen Parker (Patricia Arquette) has nightmares with Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund), he cuts her wrist and her mother Elaine Parker (Brooke Bundy) believes her daughter wants to commit suicide. Elaine interns Kristen in an institution for therapy with teenagers with dream disorder, where she meets other youngsters having trouble with Freddy Krueger under the treatment of Dr. Elizabeth Simms (Priscilla Pointer) and Dr. Neil Gordon (Craig Wasson). When the intern of dream therapy Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) arrives in the hospital, she discovers that Kristen has the ability to draw other people to her dreams, and she convinces Dr. Gordon that Freddy Kruger does exist and needs to be destroyed. Nancy uses Kristen and the other teenagers together in a group session to join forces against and destroy Freddy Krueger in their common nightmare. Meanwhile Dr. Gordon meets Sister Mary Helena (Nan Martin) that tells him who is Freddy Krueger and how to destroy the evil character forever.""A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors"" is my favorite sequel of Freddy Krueger's franchise. Written by Wes Craven and with the return of Nancy Thompson, the story explains how the evil Freddy Krueger was generated. This movie is also the debut of the gorgeous Patricia Arquette and Jennifer Rubin. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""A Hora do Pesadelo 3: Os Guerreiros dos Sonhos"" (""The Hour of the Nightmare 3: The Warriors of the Dreams"")",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
4,gavin6942,Some of the More Memorable Freddy Kills,7,22 October 2012,"Survivors of undead serial killer Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) -- who stalks his victims in their dreams -- learn to take control of their own dreams in order to fight back.One thing I like about the ""Elm Street"" series is its continuity. While my favorite horror series is ""Friday the 13th"", you have to give them credit for continually bringing back Heather Langenkamp and Robert Englund. ""13th"" rarely used the same actor to play Jason, and only vaguely tried to use the same survivor twice.What makes this one of the better ones in the series? Dokken. Not only the ""Dream Warriors"" song, but the rocking tune of ""Into the Fire"". (I have heard not all versions of the movie use this song... but when I saw it on the big screen at the Portage Theater in Chicago, it rocked our collective butts.Some of the more memorable Freddy kills appear in this movie, particularly the sleepwalking scene. Although I recalled relatively little else from having seen this film years before, that scene stuck out as if I had seen it yesterday. Very, very creepy using a kid's veins as puppet strings.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
5,lee_eisenberg,in dreams,5,11 February 2006,"More of Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) killing teenagers, but this time Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) returns to help fight him (John Saxon also returns as her father). Patricia Arquette appears in an early role, as does a still young Laurence Fishburne. No doubt you'll really like the TV scene - that'll teach 'em to watch too much TV - and the marionette scene. You gotta figure that they must have fun making these movies. I know that in ""Scream"", they said that only the first ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" was good, but ""Dream Warriors"" is pretty harmless.Do you remember that time that ""Mother Goose and Grimm"" portrayed Freddy Krueger and Edward Scissorhands meeting? They made the mistake of shaking hands.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
6,jboothmillard,A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors,6,20 May 2013,"The first film is a classic scary movie, but the first sequel was absolutely dreadful, thankfully the concept and ideas put together for the iconic villain had improved much more in this third film, from director Charles 'Chuck' Russell (The Mask, Eraser, The Scorpion King), written by returning Wes Craven (The Hills Have Eyes, Scream). Basically six years have passed since the brutal events on Elm Street, and one night teenager Kristen Parker (young Patricia Arquette) is building a papier-mâché of the infamous house on Elm Street, and she refuses to go to sleep, but she does fall asleep and dreams of being inside this constructed house being chased by a psycho killer. Waking from the shock of this bad dream and finds her wrists slashed, her parents assume she attempted suicide and she is admitted to Westin Hills hospital, and there she meets dream specialist Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp), former victim to previous terror now a new intern. Nancy realises she is dreaming about child murderer and razor handed killer Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund), recognising her reciting the nursery rhyme about him, ""One, two, Freddy's coming for you. Three, four, better lock the door. Five, six, grab a crucifix. Seven, eight, gonna stay up late. Nine, ten, never sleep again!"" But Kristen is not the only one in the hospital suffering these chronic nightmares, other inmates having them are talented puppet maker Phillip (Bradley Gregg), Roland Kincaid (Ken Sagoes) who is a tough guy with attitude problems, former drug addict Taryn White (Jennifer Rubin), Joey (Rodney Eastman) who stays silent following trauma, formerly suicidal and now wheelchair bound Will Stanton (Ira Heiden), and wannabe actress Jennifer Caulfield (Penelope Sudrow). Of course one by one these patients fall asleep, despite some attempts to stay awake, and in their dreams they fall victim to Freddy who kills them, meaning that they die in reality as well, so with the advice of Nancy they try using pills to eliminated their dreams all together. Somehow Nancy and Dr. Neil Gordon (Craig Wasson) find out that the bones of Krueger were never buried after he was burned to death by the parents of Elm Street, so she asks her father Donald Thompson (John Saxon) to retrieve the remains of the killer and that a way to destroy him one and for all would to bury them in the ground. Meanwhile she tells the remaining patients of the ward that they have the power to combat Freddy in their dreams, especially with the psychic like powers of Kristen, Nancy and Don are killed encountering the monster, but Neil does manage to bury the bones causing Freddy to explode. In the end a funeral is held for the Thompsons, with Kristen and the remaining victims attending, and Neil notices nun Mary Helena (Nan Martin) there, who he met earlier, in fact she is Amanda Krueger, Freddy's mother, and when Neil goes to sleep he has the papier-mâché house by his side, and inside the lights come on, suggesting Freddy is not dead and will return. Also starring Laurence 'Larry' Fishburne as Max the hospital porter and Priscilla Pointer as Dr. Elizabeth Simms. Langenkamp is a welcome return as the more mature and educated original victim helping the others out, Arquette proves a good choice in her part of the psychic girl, Englund returns to form with his cheeky one-liners and vicious kills, and little known Fishburne charms in his moments. The story is much more thought out than the film before, the death sequences are just as inventive as the original film, e.g. veins used as puppet strings, the dream world having no limits is used well, and the homage to Ray Harryhausen with a living skeleton is fun, and moments with a Freddy snake, a possessed television and tongues pinning a victim are cool, it is a most watchable horror film. Good!",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
7,Tweekums,Freddy is back again and this time so is Nancy,7,28 June 2017,"As this instalment opens teenager Kristen Parker is making a papier-mâché model of a house; the house that featured in the first two films. When she sleeps she finds herself in the house where she is chased by Freddy Krueger. She flees to her own bathroom where Krueger attacks her. Her mother finds her with bleeding wrists and a razor blade in her hand. Her mother has her committed to the Westin Hospital. Here it becomes apparent that she isn't the only teenager who is there who has been plagued by nightmares. The staff believe that the nightmares are a way of projecting their own guilt; the fact that the dreams are so similar don't seem to concern them. A new member of staff does believe them though; Nancy Thompson the girl who faced Krueger in the first film has grown up and become an intern therapist at the hospital. She learns that Kristen has the power to pull people into her dreams a power that she will attempt to use to help the teens battle Freddy. Meanwhile Nancy persuades Dr Neil Gordon to try some experimental treatment. He also has a run in with a nun who tells him the story of Freddy's origin and states that if he is to be ultimately defeated his remains must be buried in hallowed ground.This is a pretty good sequel, which is closer to the original than the previous sequel; once again Freddy's attacks take place in the world of dreams and Nancy is the protagonist once more. These dream sequences feature some highly inventive and well executed special effects; they also provide some decent scares. The story is interesting and the setting adds to the feeling of oppression. The cast does a solid job and includes some well-known actors including Patricia Arquette as Kristen and Laurence Fishburne in a relatively minor role. Even though it was only a small part of the overall story I liked the fact that we learnt more about Freddy Krueger's origins. There are a few surprises, most notably at the conclusion. Overall this was a good addition to the franchise; if you thought about dropping the series after Part Two but enjoyed the first film I recommend giving this a go as it is much closer to the original.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
8,ma-cortes,Again Freddy Krueger killing teens in macabre and gruesome special effects,6,14 July 2008,"Nowadays, a teens(Patricia Arquette, Jennifer Rubin, Eastman, Gregg, among them) jailed into a psychiatric hospital start to be haunted in their nightmares by scar-faced and dream-hunting Freddy Krueger(Robert Englund), a kind of spectre with horrible burns and large knives. He enters their dreams at will and again kill them. Nancy(Heather Langenkamp), the survivor from the original movie is a psychiatrist, and along with another medic(Craig Wasson) help the troubled adolescents to attempt to stop him . Furthermore, appears a nun who has a dark secret about those who originally burned him to death.This is a reworking upon first film's plot by screenwriters Wes Craven, Frank Darabont and Chuck Russell. It's one of the best sequels from successful original film by Craven. Special effects realized by Dream Quest are the spotlight and startling make up by Kevin Yagher. Young casting and special appearance by John Saxon, Zsa Zsa Gabor and Larry Fishburne. Creepy and imaginatively made musical score fitting to terror movie by Angel Badalamenti-Twin Peaks-. Colorful and atmospheric cinematography by Roy H. Wagner. Followed by a handful of sequels, as 'Dream master'(1988) by Renny Harlin, and 'The dream child'(1989) by Stephen Hopkins, besides a Television series 'The Freddy's nightmares'. The motion picture is professionally directed by Chuck Russell. He's a horror movies expert, such as proved in 'Bless the child',and 'The Blob' and action movies specialist,' Erased',and 'the Scorpion King' and in production, 'Mandrake' .",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
9,BA_Harrison,Thoroughly entertaining third chapter in the Elm Street series.,8,29 April 2007,"After the totally awful crap-fest that was Freddy's Revenge, the only way was up for the next film in the series. Wisely dispensing with any notion of scaring the audience (Freddy had well and truly lost his aura of menace after Pt.2), director Chuck Russell amped up Freddy's mischievous wisecracking persona and pitted him against a group of teens who have learnt to master special powers within their dreams. The result is a pleasing popcorn horror laden with impressive special effects that, if anything, is certainly never boring.Patricia Arquette plays Kristen, a young girl who is suffering from horrific nightmares featuring you-know-who. Eventually, she winds up in a hospital with others who are also experiencing similar bad dreams. When the kids start to die, Dr. Neil Gordon (Craig Wasson), aided by Freddy's old adversary, Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp), sets out to defeat Krueger once and for all.Once again, the plot makes little sense if studied too closely, but fans of gory, inventive and tongue-in-cheek horror should have a great time as Robert Englund quips and slices away at the terrified teens. Victims die in a variety of silly ways, from being turned into human marionettes (controlled by the veins ripped from their arms and legs), to being pushed head first into a TV set, to having their arms pumped full of drugs via Freddy's special set of syringe-fingered gloves. There's even a welcome touch of T&A in one scene in which a young lad is seduced by a hot blonde nurse with a mighty fine rack, only for her to turn into Freddy during a torrid topless tonguing session!The daft ending sees Dr. Gordon and Nancy's dad (John Saxon) battling with Freddy's reanimated skeleton in a deserted junkyard, whilst the 'Dream Warriors' (Kristen and her pals) attempt to rescue one of their own (the aforementioned teen who gets it on with the 'nurse'), who is trapped in a nightmare.Only the most timid of movie-goers will find this instalment at all scary, but with its innovative visuals and constant action, most fans of the genre should have a great time with this one. After all, any film with a character described as 'the bastard son of a hundred maniacs' has got to be worth seeing!7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
10,Quinoa1984,One of the better ones in the series,8,12 July 2000,"This film in the series isn't as great as part 1, but it is a hell of a lot better than part 2, 4 and 5 (am I still with everyone here). In this film, Craven returns as co-writer and so do stars Heather Langenkamp and John Saxon (they wouldn't return again until part 7). But it isn't just that, it is also the breakthrough performances by Patricia Arquette and Laurence Fishburne. They bring the plot about a group of kids in a mental home, who have sleep deprivation thanks to the Fred man (Robert Englund). But luckily, Langenkamp comes to the rescue by adding her old expertise in the problems. Very smart, and very cool (definatelty the best horror film of 1987), just not as good as some of the other parts. Still very watchable.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
11,BandSAboutMovies,The best of the entire series,10,29 October 2018,"After the much-criticized second installment (I actually really enjoyed it, as it has a lot of European flair and its subject matter seems like a middle finger in the face of teenage boys who would seem to be its biggest audience), Wes Craven returned to write the script, which was inspired by the phenomenon of children traveling to a specific location to commit suicide (think Japanese murder forests).Frank Darabont and Chuck Russell took that direction and convinced New Line that the series should go further into Freddy's dream world. The success of this film proved that A Nightmare on Elm Street would be a franchise, as this film made more than the first two movies put together. The team would go on to create 1988's remake of The Blob before Darabont went into making Stephen King adaptions and Russell would direct The Mask, The Scorpion King and Collateral.Kristen Parker (Patricia Arquette) is obsessed with the abandoned house on Elm Street (which one assumes is the last house on the left), making papier-mâché sculptures (which makes for a great compressed credit sequence, showing headlines of what has gone on before) and dreaming of Freddy chasing her. She awakens from her nightmare to discover that she's slicing her own wrists as her mother Elaine (Brooke Bundy) has to interrupt her sleepover dare to save her daughter's life.Kristen ends up in Westin Hospital, run by Dr. Neil Gordon (Craig Wasson, Body Double), battling the orderlies and doctors who want to sedate her. Check out a young Laurence Fishburne here as orderly Max Daniels! She's eventually helped by the new therapist - Nancy Thompson! - who recites Freddy's nursery rhyme to her. Continuity be damned, Nancy's grey streak is now on the opposite side of her head.We meet the rest of the patients, who will soon become the Dream Warriors: Phillip the sleepwalker (Bradley Gregg, Class of 1999), wheelchair-bound Will (Ira Heiden, Elvira, Mistress of the Dark), streetwise Kincaid, actress Jennifer (Penelope Sudrow, After Midnight), the silent Joey and Taryn, a former drug addict.The Dream Warriors is pure entertainment. Freddy makes his move toward being more of a joking character while transforming into a snake, a TV set, a gigantic puppet master and even turns his fingers into drug-filled hypodermic needles. Kristen can pull the rest of the teens into her dreams, which they'll need as Freddy and all of their doctors are pretty much against them.Enlisting Nancy's dad (John Saxon returns!), Neil digs up Freddy's bones, which are stilly deadly, while Nancy tries to save as many of the kids as she can within the dreamworld.The film puts an end to Nancy's saga while setting things up for a new cast of characters to do battle with Freddy. At least that's what you're supposed to think, as A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master pretty much wipes the slate clean within the first ten minutes.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
12,Coventry,The bastard son of a 100 maniacs!,7,13 September 2005,"This third installment in the ""Elm Street""-saga immediately became my favorite, simply because the story ingeniously adds a whole lot to the Freddy Krueger mythology! Somewhere halfway into the film, we're informed about the tasteless and sickening details of Krueger's conception and it right away explains the nature of his violent persona! In case you too like your horror as morbid as possible, it's guaranteed that you'll consider this part 3 the best entry in the entire series. Arguably even better than (or at least as good as) the 1984 original, since the ultra-morbid twist definitely makes up for the surprise element of the original that, of course, no longer features here. Even without the better scenario, ""Dream Warriors"" is a vast improvement over the mediocre part two, since it has more tension, likable characters and more imaginative killing sequences. This time, Freddy Krueger terrorizes an institute of dream-disordered teenagers and he makes their deaths look like suicides. Nancy Thompson, the heroine of the original, stars as the only doctor who understands the teenagers' fear of falling asleep and even her father (the almighty John Saxon) helps with putting Freddy in his grave for good. The hospital/mental institution makes a great, atmospheric setting the visual gimmicks are quite impressive. Good acting performances by Patricia Arquette and Craig Wasson also contribute to the higher quality of this third chapter and Chuck Russell's surefooted directing is much better than Jack Sholder's.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

15,hitchcockthelegend,The bastard son of a 100 maniacs.,7,5 September 2009,"Nancy Thompson, survivor of the Elm Street murders is a psychiatrist brought in to help troubled kids at Westin Hills Psychiatric Hospital. All of these teens have one thing in common, their dreams are being invaded by someone Nancy knows only too well, Freddy Krueger.After the abomination bore that was A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge, New Line Cinema set about making a better and more truer sequel to 1984's excellent A Nightmare on Elm Street. Recalling series creator Wes Craven, who had bailed after the first film claiming he didn't want a franchise born, and installing the first film's scream queen Heather Langenkamp in a more mature role, New Line meant business. With more budget to hand and Craven aided in the writing by Frank Darabont, Chuck Russell and Bruce Wagner, the end result is arguably the best sequel of what was to become a money spinning franchise.With a sharp elaborate story focusing on troubled kids, and dealing in themes such as teen suicide, heroin addiction and dream suppressant drugs, all that was needed was authentic location work and the skill to formulate horror sequences worthy of the name. Thankfuly we get both. Some of the disturbing and gruesome methods used by Freddy as he cruelly goes about offing the last of the Elm Street children, are some of the series best. Puppetry, TV and needle point rushes are just a few on offer, while a skeleton sequence harks to the work of one Ray Harryhausen. There's even a nice plot thread involving a nun that puts a bit more meat on Freddie's troubling back story.But some problems do harm the film. Heather Langenkamp, bless her, was suitably cast in the first film, here she is not. Badly out of sorts trying to convince everyone she's a mature psychiatrist, she's even out acted by the almost worse Craig Wasson as Neil Gordon. One glance at the subsequent post Elm Street 3 career of Langenkamp sadly speaks volumes. She isn't helped tho by the exuberance of the young and upcoming cast around her, led by pivotal Patricia Arquette as Kristen Parker and boasting cool in the form of Bradley Gregg's sleep walker, Phillip. It's with the youngsters that Elm Street 3 is ultimately remembered for, well that and the ingenious ways Krueger tries to off them of course. Laurence Fishburne is also in it but is underused as Max, a hospital orderly with a heart.This was the last time that an Elm Street movie had some nous about it. Before Krueger became a caricature of a caricature, where a quip became more important than an effective, and intelligently constructed kill. Craven wanted out, but after making a $40 million domestic profit on part 3, it opened up scope for further ventures. Ventures that sadly took the franchise, and its main character down hill fast. 7/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
16,Hey_Sweden,One of the best in the series.,8,15 December 2012,"Thoroughly entertaining entry in the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" franchise introduces new twists to the standard story, and gives us a larger than usual group of main characters to be tormented by the dream haunting psychopath Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund). The last of the Elm Street children are now confined to a psychiatric institution, but nobody will take their claims of a nightmare bogeyman seriously until original survivor Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) comes there to work. She works with nice guy doctor Neil Gordon (Craig Wasson) to help, and encourages the teens to band together in the fight against Freddy. Co- written by Frank Darabont and debuting director Chuck Russell, based on a story by series creator Wes Craven and Bruce Wagner, is appealing for giving our protagonists more hope than usual, and giving them each distinct personalities. There's the mute Joey (Rodney Eastman), the tough-talking Kincaid (Ken Sagoes), and the recovering drug addict Taryn (Jennifer Rubin), among others, while the vulnerable Kirsten (Patricia Arquette) takes centre stage as the girl who has the ability to ""pull"" other people into her dreams. The top notch cast also includes Laurence Fishburne as Max the orderly, Priscilla Pointer as hard headed doctor Elizabeth Simms, Nan Martin as a helpful nun who gives us some more back story on Freddy and his origins, Brooke Bundy as Kirstens' bitchy mother, John Saxon reprising his role of Lt. Donald Thompson, and Dick Cavett and Zsa Zsa Gabor in cameos as themselves. In this sequel, we can see Freddy was already being taken in the direction of being a one liner spewing anti hero (""What's wrong, Joey? Feeling tongue tied?"") and he's still a cool character but just not as scary. The set pieces and special effects are among the best for this series, with Freddy-as-snake, a living marionette manipulated by his ripped out veins, and a nifty stop motion skeleton standing out; Freddy's makeup this time around is the work of Kevin Yagher. The cast is fun to watch, with Wassons' doctor required to go through the biggest character arc as he's forced to put aside everything he's already learned and to open his mind. The iconic house is just one of a couple of excellent, stylized sets (gotta love that automobile junkyard), and Angelo Badalamentis' music score is quite good if not as memorable as the Charles Bernstein themes of the original. And it's impossible to knock any film with a theme song as kick ass as Dokkens' ""Dream Warriors"". All in all, this is well worth watching and ranks up there with Nightmare 1 and ""New Nightmare"" as a highpoint in this succession of films. Eight out of 10.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
17,poolandrews,One of the best of the whole series.,7,9 April 2007,"A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors starts as a young girl named Kristen Parker (Patricia Arquette) has a horrifying nightmare involving the child killer Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) which ends up in her cutting her wrist with a razor, she is hospitalised at the 'Western Hills' psychiatric institute with various other teenagers with sleep problems. Run by Dr. Neil Gordon (Craid Wasson) the institute has a new employee, a certain Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) who immediately uses her own experiences of Freddy to try & comfort the kids, but Freddy is determined to take the last of the Elm street children...Co-written & directed by Chuck Russell this is one of the better entries in the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. The script by Russell, Wes Craven, Frank Darabont & Bruce Wagner completely ignores the events of A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge (1985), some would say wisely including me, & is more of a sequel to the original as it goes back to Freddy the boogie man stalking the Elm Street kids in their dreams, it's certainly an improvement over Part 2 & is a pretty decent film in it's own right. This one also introduced the extravagant set-piece murders & the jokey one-liners spoken by Freddy that would pretty much shape how the rest of the series & further sequels went, the kills are pretty imaginative & I loved the scene when Freddy uses a guys veins from his wrists & feet to control him like a string puppet. The film moves along at a decent pace & it also follows on from the original & explores Freddy's origins in some detail. On the down side there's a very modest body count of five & there are a couple of points where it does drag a bit.Director Russell does a fine job & there's some nice scenes here. The body count is low but the kills themselves are pretty cool & the special effects are impressive too. There's a nice atmosphere to it & there's some gore but not much, someones stomach is slashed, there's a decapitated head & the bloody vein death. There is also a cool stop motion animation skeleton that reminded me of the ones from Jason and the Argonauts (1963).With a healthy sounding budget of about $5,000,000 this looks good with pretty good & ambitious special effects, it's well made with decent enough production values. The acting was OK & it was nice to see John Saxon return.A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors is a good sequel that wisely forgets Part 2 & takes it's lead from the original A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), well worth a watch. Followed by A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master (1988).",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
18,utgard14,"""Let's snuff the sucka!""",7,26 October 2015,"For my money this is the best Elm Street sequel. The story has Nancy Thompson from the first Elm Street film now an adult and working at a psychiatric hospital where teenage patients are being stalked in their dreams by Freddy Krueger. One of these teenagers (Patricia Arquette in her film debut) has a special gift that becomes the key in defeating Freddy once and for all (or at least until the next sequel). Nightmare 3 has a lot going for it. It has the return of Heather Langenkamp as Nancy, a smart script written by Wes Craven, a memorable theme song by '80s metal band Dokken, and some impressive dream set pieces. The movie also has more going on in the story department than just about all the other sequels put together. The teens here are interesting characters rather than the usual cardboard cutouts that are there just to annoy us until Freddy gleefully slaughters them. I actually liked most of these kids! That by itself is pretty amazing for a horror film, where unlikable supporting characters are the norm. As I said the script is great, as is the cast. In addition to Langenkamp, Arquette, and (of course) Robert Englund, the cast includes Craig Wasson, Jennifer Rubin, Rodney Eastman, Bradley Gregg, Laurence Fishburne, and John Saxon reprising his role from the first movie as Nancy's dad. Special mention for Ken Sagoes as the foul-mouthed tough kid, Kincaid. Chuck Russell's direction is solid, if not as stylish as Jack Sholder's work in part 2. That's about the only thing part 2 has over this one, believe me. As far as quality Elm Street movies go, there's this, the original, and maybe New Nightmare. Everything else is varying degrees of suck.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
19,lastliberal,Let's snuff the sucka.,7,16 April 2008,"Writer/Director Chuck Russell did a really good job on Wes Craven's story and, although I have not seen but one other in the series, this was an enjoyable film and I could easily see why some think it the best in the series.Heather Langenkamp did a great job as Nancy and really made this more than just a slasher film. There was a good story behind it and you really wanted to see how it turned out, even though you knew that he would be unkillable.Seeing Patricia Arquette (""Medium"") in her first screen appearance was a real bonus. She also did a great job.Seeing Laurence Fishburne (What's Love Got to Do with It , The Matrix) was another bonus, as I always like him.And, who was that nurse!",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
20,Boba_Fett1138,"A pretty good movie,",7,1 October 2009,"For a third movie in an horror franchise, this movie is simply a surprisingly great one. Of course it's not as good as the first, mostly because of the reason that it doesn't has the same originality and freshness over it but the movie remains a perfectly watchable one.I have always liked ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors"". It's perhaps the only sequel in the long running franchise that is actually solidly written and is also being original, along with the 7th part ""New Nightmare"".The story also really works out due to its nice settings and also good characters involved. The movie isn't just simply written as an horror movie set at an haunted mansion, the horror is made more psychological, when the movie for most part gets set at a psychiatric institution. The horror mostly involves its characters and their fears for their dreams, in which Freddy Krueger shows up, at night. The writing doesn't simply rely on the standard shock and gore effects but actually spends more time on its story-telling and development, which works refreshing and effective.The movie also had the good fortune that it had some good casting involved. Heather Langenkamp reprises her role from the first movie and of course Robert Englund is also present again as Freddy Krueger, who's past and origin also gets developed more this time. Further more the movie also features some young yet-to-be-stars, such as Patricia Arquette and Laurence Fishburne. Patricia Arquette actually made her screen-debut with this movie.What makes the movie also great to watch are its effects. Normally special effects and horror don't blend in very well with each other but in this case it truly adds to the horror and overall feeling of the movie. For 1987 some of the effects are simply good looking, though by todays standards it's certainly a bit outdated to watch.Really a good movie within the series and its genre.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
21,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,About as bad as I feared,5,1 August 2010,"The original didn't need and shouldn't have had(just ask Wes Craven) any sequels. It was an excellent concept executed beautifully. The problem is that the idea behind it, when someone is desperate enough for a follow-up, can lead to... *this*. Yes, Krueger is terrorizing a new group of teens. By... scaring them. They go to sleep, he appears, and he doesn't kill them. No, that's what is apparently happening leading up to the beginning of this film. And he doesn't need to worry, because there are plenty of people who want to ensure that the kids, all placed in a hospital ward, sleep. Enter Nancy, who thankfully helps keep this from getting any more ""we don't know what we're dealing with(even though every member of the audience does)"" than it, well, does. Oh, and these guys have abilities in their dreams. No, you read that right. And if you ignore(as the makers of this did) that horror is best when the villain and the victims are *not* equal, the skills are stupid and exceedingly lame. How anyone thought this would be good is beyond me. Honestly, if it's straight fantasy/adventure, maybe, but don't bring supernatural stuff into it controlled by the protagonists when we're meant to be terrified. Unlike the first one, this doesn't evoke the feeling of being in a nightmare. It tries, on occasion, and awkwardness ensues. Freddy(who is now vocal, taunting, using cool one-liners) doesn't chase as much, and when he does, it's less effective. Like the second, it's bizarre at times when it attempts to be creepy. It manages to be eerie at times, and the FX tend to be well-done(especially the clay-mation), if the creative gags are few and far between. Actually, this seems to strain itself trying to produce them, with there being absurdly specific stuff based on who the toasted antagonist is going after. The characters are mostly obnoxious or dull; I didn't really care about any of them, they weren't developed enough. Fishburn delivers a solid performance, but he's just about the only one. The acting is decent for the rest, if no one is necessarily shockingly poor. This was Arquette's movie debut, and it shows. It's directed by Chuck Russell, of The Mask, Eraser and The Scorpion King. That list ought to tell you that he can do well at effect-laden flicks... as well as, you know, *not* well. Yeah, this is another case of the latter. Well, in his defense, in the three cases, the script is to blame. This provides backstory, and that part is OK. The climax is unexciting, and this has the weakest ending of these three. There is a moderate amount of bloody, gory violence and disturbing content, as well as a little nudity and strong language in this. The Ultimate Collector's Edition 7-Disc DVD set comes with the feature Jump To A Nightmare, the trailer, and the music video for the awful, inappropriate pop song of the same title as this picture. I recommend this to anyone that this sounds appealing to. 5/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
22,view_and_review,Dreamers Fight Back,6,26 August 2019,"After a poor showing in part two, Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund), made a strong comeback for part three: Dream Warriors.In this episode there are a group of teens that are all in Weston Hills Psychiatric Hospital. The one thing they all have in common are their nightmares-Freddy is in all of them. When Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) comes to offer her expertise the kids all now have a name for their tormentor. These last children of the Freddy Krueger vanquishers, led by Kristen (Patricia Arquette), will have to band together in order to fight the dream killer.I thought this was a significant improvement over part two. There was no ambiguity of who Freddy was and very little real world interaction. Towards the end they stretched a bit but it wasn't a huge transgression.I actually like the idea of the youngsters fighting back in their dreams. If you think about it, all of us are able to do things in our dreams that we can't ordinarily do in the real world so why not be able to fight back a monster?Part three was a creative addition to the franchise and got the nightmares back on track.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
23,Uriah43,An Improvement Upon the Previous Film in the Franchise,6,26 May 2020,"This film essentially begins one year after Freddy's last visit with a young teenage girl named ""Kristen Parker"" (Patricia Arquette) having nightmares which eventually cause her to be committed a psychiatric hospital. While there she meets other teenagers who are having similar nightmares. Not long afterward, a new intern named ""Nancy Thompson"" (Heather Langenkamp) arrives and gains their trust by revealing that she has also had encounters with Freddy and recommends that they all band together to fight him as a team. Unfortunately, one prominent psychiatrist by the name of ""Dr. Elizabeth Simms"" (Priscilla Pointer) is outraged by these suggestions and does everything she can to not only separate them but to administer medicine to help them sleep-which is exactly what ""Freddy Kreuger"" (Robert Englund) wants. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I thought that this third film in the series sequel was a step up from the previous picture in that it was more imaginative and had better action and CGI. Admittedly, the graphics at the end were a bit preposterous but other than that I thought it was rather entertaining for the most part and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
24,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Original entry in the series,9,2 May 2016,"When her nightmares start proving injurious, a teen's admission into a psychiatry clinic puts her in contact with others who share her delusions about a a razor-gloved killer stalking them and must band them together to fight him off for good.This one is actually really good and quite surprisingly holds up real well. As with most of the movies in the series, this one gets quite a lot right here when it's filled with some great dream moments. The opening is one of those, as we are just repeatedly thrown one horrific image after another throughout the house which scores nicely at generating lots of action and tension as well which really help out with the scene, a fantastic effort where they get sucked into a dream where the Freddy worm begins attacking them and the results of the group hypnosis session that features their burgeoning realization of their situation, the discovery of the missing patient and the changing room before his big break-out makes for a wholly enjoyable series of events here, which all go hand-in-hand with the impressive kills along the way. From the shredded-tendons human-marionette to the TV screen face-plant and the different cut-ups with his clawed hands, there's plenty of impressive kills here that come along with all the different effects work in the dream-world. It's all done quite nicely here with the way this one presents the dark and demented world of his dreams quite well as there's plenty of dark, demented work here in creating not just the atmosphere but also the different props throughout the sequence which is so much fun with the action involved in such a setting as well that it really scores nicely. Along with finally getting a reason for why he's still coming back, this is the start of comic Freddy, so he has some okay lines for his kills that provides some chuckles for some. There's a few small problems here with this one. It does have some pretty bad lines, but it is still the start of him turning into a comedy star so some are quite groaners that can lead to some real moments of agony as you wait for the next kill. As well, the middle part of the film is pretty slow, which is quite the opposite of the thrilling intro and ending, so the middle is a bit hard to sit through. Despite the reappearance of Nancy, she really isn't given a lot to do other than tell what Krueger can do to the children. For someone who had firsthand experience with dealing with Freddy, she should've had a larger role in the film, especially billed third on the top. Still, this is one of the better entries in the series.Rated R: Graphic Language, Graphic Violence, Nudity and drug use.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
25,FlashCallahan,I've killed you once before......,6,22 January 2015,"Nancy has grown up and become a psychiatrist specialising in dream therapy. She meets a group of children at a local hospital facing Freddy Krueger, the same demon she once encountered in her sleep. One of them is Kristen, who has the power to draw other people into her dreams. Working with a male doctor assigned to the case, Nancy helps the kids realise their special abilities within the nightmare world. When Freddy captures one of her charges, she leads a rescue attempt into Krueger's domain, in hopes of putting his spirit to rest once and for all.....Out of all of the sequels, not counting the New Nightmare, or anything after, this has to be the most fun of the series. Nope, it's not scary in the slightest, and it sticks a huge middle finger up to the original film, but this is where Freddy came into his own, and the one liners were more exciting than anything the film had to offer.It's basically the Marvel comic book version of Elm Street. By day, they are just normal kids with a jagged, haunted past, but by night, when finally asleep, they are heroes with their own unique powers.And after twenty eight years, it's amazing to see how well the film holds up compared to the other movies, and amazingly, the special effects are still pretty awe-inspiring.The cast are the usual Krueger fodder, and you can almost guess which ones will get it first, and who will survive.All in all, its a fun, forgettable entry into a franchise that time forgot.Only in the eighties.....",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
26,movieman_kev,Wisely pretends that the horrid part 2 ever existed,6,10 October 2005,"Kirsten Parker (Patricia Arquette), after suffering a perceived suicide attempt, is sent to a institutionalized hospital where Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp reprising her role from the first film) is a new psychiatrist specializing in dream therapy at. It isn't long before everybody's favorite demonic pedophile (no not Victor Salva), Freddy Krueger is up to his old games. This film VERY wisely pretends that the homo-erotic part 2 never existed, instead opting to expand the mythos and personality of Freddy. I, of course, enjoyed the former while ignoring the fact that Krueger was slowly turning into a bad stand-up comedian and less a menacing force of Evil (this film isn't guilty as much as later entries would be, but you could see the seeds being sown). Almost as good as the first one and what it lacks in genuine scares, it makes up for in plot line and sheer inventiveness.Eye Candy: Stacey Alden reveals her 'twin talents' My Grade: B DVD Extras: Cast and Crew Bios; and Jump to a Nightmare option (more extras for the film can be found on the seventh disc of The Nightmare Collection DVD set) DVD-Rom content: Trivia game; Screenplay; and web link",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
27,Wuchakk,Effective second sequel,7,15 June 2016,"Released in 1987, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors"" picks up where the original 1984 movie left off. Fresh from college, Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) is now a psychiatrist specializing in dream therapy. She gets a gig at a psychiatric hospital to help a group of teens who face Freddy Krueger, the same supernatural psycho she encountered in the original (Robert Englund). One of the kids is Kristen (Patricia Arquette), who has the power to draw others into her dreams. Hooking up with a male doctor (Craig Wasson), Nancy tries to equip the kids and strategizes a rescue attempt into Krueger's domain, with the hope of putting the fiend to death forever. Laurence Fishburne is on hand as staff security at the institute.Some people feel that ""Dream Warriors"" is the real follow-up to the original movie, which benefited by bringing Wes Craven back to the fold for the script. They feel the actual first sequel, 1985's ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge,"" was just a rushed attempt to get a sequel out as fast as possible to capitalize on the still hot hype of the original. They say it wasn't well thought-out or paced and therefore seems out-of-sync. I disagree. I found it a perfectly fitting and effective continuation of the story. We know from part 3 (this movie) that Nancy was off at college during the time of part 2 so what was wrong with showing what was happening back on Elm Street with a new cast of characters?In any case, practically the entire story in ""Dream Warriors"" takes place in or around the psychiatric hospital, and you really get the feeling that the staff and patients are real people. You sense, for instance, that Max (Fishburne) really cares about the kids; moreover, the warmth between Nancy and Dr. Gordon (Wasson) is palpable. Like the original, Heather makes for a quality protagonist and Englund is charismatic as the sinister psycho.The movie runs 96 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles (the psychiatric hospital is at UCLA in Westwood).GRADE: B",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
28,Aaron1375,DREAM WARRIORS...DON'T WANT TO SLEEP NO MORE...,6,14 February 2004,"Yes, this was the first ""Nightmare on Elm St"" to have its own theme song if you do not count the one two Freddy's coming for you one.  This was also the start of a trend of Freddy becoming more of a comedian rather than a really creepy and spooky killer.  Despite that though, I still like it quite a bit. He still maintains a bit of spookiness here and his kills are still rather good before they would become kind of goofy in the next installment (the roach motel).  Here a bunch of kids are in a ward because they believe Freddy is coming for them and for that reason they are really quite sleep deprived.  The girl from the first one returns too try and help them as she is one of the few who knows Freddy really exists and by golly he is going to kill them.  She and the kids plan...learn to manipulate the dreams and fight Freddy at his own game.  One guy turns into a wizard in the dream world, another gets super strong, and one gal turns into a punk rock girl.  Of course, no of these powers are really all that helpful and in the end it takes some guys out of the dream world to stop Freddy, or is he stopped. Laurence Fisburne of ""The Matrix"" is apparently in this, but I don't remember him unless he was the strong guy, but I don't think he was.  Also, I always wondered if the guy who wouldn't talk was supposed to be the guy from part two.

30,StevePulaski,Reinvigorating a franchise that went off course quickly,8,22 October 2015,"A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors is a more complete and well-paced film than both of its predecessors, much more consistent in its narrative and its creation of the laws by which Freddy Krueger abides. The first Nightmare on Elm Street focused on a setting that was largely eerie and a slowburn narrative approach whilst the second film largely abandoned the logic of the previous film and had Freddy serve as a metaphor for an insecure, homosexual teen's repressed side. The third installment in the franchise continues playing ""musical directors and writers,"" switching up who occupies the director's chair and who holds the pen, for the better, this time allowing Chuck Russell to direct and a quartet of writers - among them the series' original creator Wes Craven and The Shawshank Redemption writer/director Frank Darabont - who finally emphasize the fear and vulnerability that Freddy places on each of his victims.Our new troubled protagonist is Kristen Parker (Patricia Arquette), who is haunted by the burnt-faced, sweater-clad figure Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) in her dreams, much to the dismay of her mother. Following an instance of alleged self-harm, however inflicted by Freddy while Kristen was in her sleep, Kristen is taken to a mental hospital, where she meets a slew of other troubled souls her own age: Philip (Bradley Gregg), a marionette puppeteer, Kincaid (Ken Sagoes), a short-fuzed, humorous loudmouth, Jennifer (Penelope Sudrow), an aspiring actress, Taryn (Jennifer Rubin), a recovering drug addict, Joey (Rodney Eastman), who has taken a vow of silence due to the terror his nightmares have given him, and Will (Ira Heiden), who is wheelchair bound following a failed suicide attempt.The curious thing about these teens is all of them were haunted by dreams of Freddy before ever having met each other. As a result, they are counseled by Dr. Nancy Thompson (Heather Lagenkamp), who was haunted by prolific nightmares on Freddy in the first film. The film revolves around the teens being imprisoned, not only by a mental hospital and the faculty who don't take them seriously, everyone except for Nancy, in addition to being held captive their dreams and recurring nightmares. The rules of Freddy's game have reverted back to the rules of the first film that were abandoned and stretched in the second installment: if you die in your dreams, you, in turn, die in real life.A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 has a plethora of interesting characters, even more-so than the original film. These characters carry personality and their frequent group meetings, where they talk about the previous events of the day and, specifically, their nightmares, further develop them as more than just young, fresh faces soon to be victims in a horror film. Their personalities shine through brightly and the screenwriters etch enough of a balance between comedy and humanity in these characters to make their deaths actually send meaningful pangs of shock and disappointment through the audience.This installment is also the point in the series where the dream sequences started to get much more elaborate and realized, in return, making them creepier and more effective. The specials effects give the feeling of being trapped within the endless boundaries of a frightening and unrelenting lucid dream, and Freddy remains a universally frightening presence that manipulates and slowly takes over. He doesn't work too fast in terms of killing his victims, nor does he spout endless quips and pop culture punchlines as if he's a standup comedian. He's pure, unadulterated evil, and the fantastic, decorated dream settings give him all the power and make us feel just as helpless as the innocent souls on screen.A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 is a lot of fun as a horror movie, not too self-serious or meta to be taken seriously, nor too bleak and dreary to be considered monotonous or uninteresting after an extended period of time. It reinvigorates the franchise with a commendable amount of emphasis on scares and set-decoration after a film that was too concerned with forming a metaphor and rejecting the fundamental rules of the series' newly instated playbook. We go back to the basics with Dream Warriors in a way that sets everything up anew in a thoroughly entertaining manner.Starring: Patricia Arquette, Robert Englund, Heather Langenkamp, Larry Fishburne, Bradley Gregg, Ken Sagoes, Penelope Sudrow, Jennifer Rubin, Rodney Eastman, and Ira Heiden.

31,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Not as good as the first, but better than the 2nd",7,11 November 2003,"A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors is the third installment of the Nightmare on Elm Street series. It's actually one of the better sequels that I enjoyed. I was lucky enough to get the Nightmare on Elm Street series boxed DVD set for my birthday. So I've now seen all the sequels and A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors is a decent sequel. Not to mention it was pretty cool to see Patricia Arquette's first big role, I can't believe a lot of these movies how many stars started out in this series. It was also a nice touch that they had Nancy back for this film. The deaths are gory and Freddy is back and meaner than ever! This time he's after the kids in the mental institution and he's not going to go easy on them at all.Nancy has now grown up and she's become a therapist for dreams, she starts her work at the mental institution where she meets Kirsten, a girl who has the power to pull other people into her dreams. Kirsten is a bit scared of her powers though and knows that Freddy wants to use her so he could pretty much squish several bugs with one stomp. But Nancy knows that Freddy is up to his old ways and wants to help Kirsten along with the other teenagers at the hospital that Freddy is after, but hopefully she can do it before it's too late.A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors has one of my favorite nightmare sequences. I loved the puppet on the strings, only, well, I won't spoil it, you're going to have to trust me when I say that this was a very cool death scene. This is a must see for the Nightmare on Elm Street fans of course, but even you're just looking for a good scare, I promise you that you'll get a few chills from watching this nightmare.

Led by survivor Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp), who is now a dream therapy psychiatrist, she leads a charge with her patients into Freddy Kruger's world and attempts to rid him and his evil once and for all.This movie has a more in-tact plot that brings us a little more action, excitement and intrigue; just the plan by the protagonist to defeat Freddy already gives this film a suspenseful good vs. evil element. The human puppet scene was the most gruesome and gritty part in the movie, definitely might make you grind your teeth.This movie, though, still has those campy dialog acting as in the first two movies and still has that dreary feel; I know it's supposed to be dreamy since these are movies about nightmares, but I thought the cinematography and surrounding atmosphere could have been made a less dull and boring. The cheese factor is still there. Overall, it's an OK film. Good for a little scare, but there are more entertaining horror movies out there.Grade C",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
34,thesar-2,"Welcome to Prime Time, Freddy!",8,10 January 2010,"Oh, thank God someone had faith in Freddy.I mean we start with the great A Nightmare on Elm Street and follow that with an abomination, A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge. Not only did they believe there's more story and more depth they can explore, they made A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors much better than most of the other 1980s horror franchises.Usually in the said horror series, especially in the 1980s, a part 3, 4 through 10 was inevitable due to the low cost to produce and return, even if small, was enough for the big wigs (see Saw series of the 2000s.) So, this part 3 was probably going to be made anyways, but wow, did they make an actually good movie.Freddy's back to take the remaining ""Elm Street Children."" He supposedly dies in both part 1 and 2 – though they ask you kindly, as any rational human would, to forget part 2 existed. I absolutely love it when series do that, when they made some bad sequels (Also see: Superman Returns that said to heck with parts III and IV.) But due to some of the souls (explored more later in the series) gave him enough power to continue.Now, the remaining teens, coincidentally enough, are all sent to a psych hospital due to ""attempted suicides."" One of them is (very high-pitched screeching) Kristen (Arquette) who has the power to bring people into her dreams and she starts with Nancy (Langenkamp,) the only teen survivor from the first movie, who begins to work there, apparently not coincidentally.Nancy rallies the rest of the team and a suspicious, but obvious love-interest doctor, to fight back in the dreams with their own special gifts before they are picked off one-by-one. Oh, and there's a mysterious nun that aids the good doc in their quest.The movie's not perfect; it does have its share of inconsistencies, such as Kristen is the only one with the power to bring people into her dream, yet, they all join her later on their own. On a side note, laughably, half the movie her name is ""Kirsten"" while the other half it's ""Kristen."" Also, Langenkamp played the teen somewhat or fairly well (ok, just ""okay"") in part one. Apparently, she does the teen role mucho better than the adult, because, I'm sorry; as much as I liked seeing a familiar face (after the dreadful part 2,) she was just plain awful here. (I'm talking about the acting, not to mention the disappearing & reappearing act of her white hair streak – it literally has a mind of its own.) And finally, even though 97% of the special effects and inventiveness was good, the claymation/Clash of the Titians skeleton in the climax was a bit laughable – especially the men's reactions.With that out of the way, I really, really liked this movie. Freddy, though not all the way out of his shell, came out mostly and was funny, actually scary and proved he was worth more visits in sequels to come. The dreams were good – not just the back alley way, or bedrooms, they actually took us places, namely to what would #1 scare the victims, but use their fears against themselves.The soundtrack was good, the depth they gave – finally some sort of Freddy background, was very interesting and the jokes were actually funny. Also, you never knew (if you haven't seen part 4) who was going to live or die, so the suspense was up, as well. For example, most of these horror sequels have bad tempered/mannered/villains that are sure to be offed due to making the audience reel in their demise, but this has plenty, yet they remain unharmed. That's part of its originality and showed the movie was focused on what it was – killing the teens of the parents who killed Freddy originally.Even if you're not a fan of the series, you should see this 1980s horror throwback. Though recommended to watch #1 first (always, ALWAYS skip #2) and then this, it gives you enough background to see this as a stand-alone feature.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

Of course they were going to franchise the series and eventually remake it. They followed the first film with a deplorable sequel that was just a huge mistake. So thank goodness they actually came back and made a third film that was far more of a worthy sequel to the original. Is it as good as the original? No. But it does give us what we actually want from a good horror sequel. Bring back the original scream queen to fight the big bad, a new cast of young hot actors that are actually good in their roles, a decent story, some good deaths and some really great and gruesome special effects. This is what A Nightmare On Elm Street is known for and what we want to see. You could literally skip Part 2 entirely and jump to Part 3 and miss nothing. A Nightmare On Elm Street 3 is just entertaining and fun and gives us even more back story into Freddy. In fact we finally discover Freddy's horrifying origins and the story gets more interesting opening more doors for future sequels. If nothing else A Nightmare On Elm Street carries a better than average story for a slasher flick.Heather Langenkamp, our original heroine, returns for this instalment, a little older, a little wiser and a psychologist in the making. She is as campy as ever. Some of her expressions in the film are downright hilarious but in a good way because you believe that she is really trying to be serious and that makes it campy in a good way. I love when a hero returns to fight their killer enemy. Craig Wasson is the newcomer as a concerned doctor. Although there is never any actual romance between his character and Langenkamp's Nancy there is some chemistry there and it helps move the story along. He does play his character very seriously and you do relate to him. Patricia Arquette is probably the scene stealer of this film. In her very first performance she is terrific as the terrified Kristen Parker with a mysterious power to pull people into her dreams. Arquette is really good and its a shame she didn't come back for future sequels. Ken Sagoes, Rodney Eastman, Jennifer Rubin, Bradley Gregg, and Ira Heiden are the Dream Warriors. The last of the Elm Street kids who are mentally disturbed for various reasons. They are all decent and you'll be able to find your favourite warrior easily enough. Some of the scenes in this film are really kind of silly once they're in the dreams but they make it fun! Honorable mentions for Lawrence Fishburne who plays a hospital staff member that truly cares about the kids and also John Saxon returning as Nancy's Dad in a small but important role. I still think Saxon is one of the best actual performers in the series.Also in his first big screen job director Chuck Russell seems to do well behind the camera. He seems to have a good handle on the dream world and what we, as fans, want to see. As I said in my review of the first film the great thing about A Nightmare On Elm Street is that nothing is off limits because Freddy exists and attacks in the dream world. That's why we can suspend belief and watch the silly antics of the warriors in their dreams because anything can happen in dreams. This instalment also features, in my opinion, one of the best death scenes when Freddy leads Phillip to jump to his death by leading him like a puppet using his veins and inside guts like marionette, gross, creative and original. Another unique aspect of A Nightmare On Elm Street series is they never bother to explain how Freddy comes back. Freddy just is. They stop him for awhile but he's unstoppable. He's raised from hell. This is definitely worthwhile leading to a solid series of horror flicks. 7.5/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
37,bowmanblue,Full of holes (but fun anyway!),8,14 August 2014,"I watched the Nightmare on Elm Street saga when it first came out. And I loved it. Now, some years later, I can see all the – many – things wrong with it. But I still love it anyway.It's fair to say that if you're into your horror movies then you probably enjoyed the first Nightmare film, about a child-killer who continues his deadly activities by invading the dreams of his young victims. However, most die-hards hated the first sequel (which had no input from the franchise's mastermind, Wes Craven). So, in Part III, Craven returns to take creative control. And it helps.We meet the last children from Elm Street, now traumatised and in a mental institution, still being picked off by Freddy Kruger. The title of 'Part III' is 'Dream Warriors.' This relates to how the kids are banding together to use their 'dream powers' to help defeat their nemesis. However, I find that title a little misleading. They aren't what I'd call 'warriors!' They're a bit useless really. And bland. In fact, the film's 'star' is easily Freddy himself, who steals every scene with his delicious evilness.You can either pick the film apart for its shortcomings, or just enjoy the imaginative dream scenes where Freddy pops up and 'offs' another teen. It's silly and fun – not scary, but there are a few 'yucky' moments (the 'puppet scene' still looks pretty grisly to this day!).http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
38,ericstevenson,My favorite in the series,8,11 October 2017,"While most people consider the original to be the best, I'd have to say that this is my favorite entry in the series. I think it's mostly because it takes places at a hospital and it features all the characters interacting with each other in such a realistic manner. The pacing of this film is great. It starts off with the first two deaths, both of which are quite creative before moving onto the big conflict. I love the idea that these characters all have their unique personalities and their own ways of dealing with dreams. Sadly, most of them still can't do much against Freddy.The special effects are quite nice too. It's kind of weird to see a girl whose main power is cartwheels be the one who seems to be the strongest. Freddy is defeated not by the actual dream warriors, but instead by the man who destroys his skeleton. It probably would have been cooler to see him get taken out by them, but it still makes for a good movie. I think this is the point where Freddy starts making puns. It's too early for this to become a huge personality trait so he doesn't come off as annoying. ***",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, grab your crucifix
Seven, eight, better stay up late
Nine, ten, never sleep againIn the third film of the ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" series Heather Langenkamp reprises the role from the first movie. The surviving girlfriend of Johnny Depp has in the meantime become a psychiatrist specializing in dreams, so she comes to a mental hospital to try to help the remaining teens from Elm Street in their struggle against Krueger. Among them is a young Patricia Arquette, for the first time on the big screen. Of the famous faces, there are also John Saxon, again in the role of Nancy's cop father, the cameo appearance of the legendary Zsa Zsa Gabor, and of course Robert Englund, for the third time in the role of Freddy Krueger. The music was done by the genius Angelo Badalamenti, best known for his music for the series ""Twin Peaks"", and the title song ""Dream Warriors"", as well as ""Into the Fire"", is signed by the cult American band Dokken, well known to all lovers of the glam metal of the eighties. Although all movies in it are based on the same premise, the franchise, for the time being, manages to make the story in each film original and completely different than in its prequels. Special effects are better, and the gore, although there's significantly less of it than before, is fairly effective. The scene with ""marionette sleepwalking"" turned my stomach inside out, and for a brief moment, I covered my eyes with my hands, like a little kid. ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" still holds its ground and the third installment stands shoulder to shoulder with the previous two. I hope it stays nightmarish in sequels to come.9/10""Sleep.

This is one of the scariest movies made before 1988. There are scarier movies. A nightmare on elm street 4 the dream master is scarier. A nightmare on elm street 5 the dream child is also scarier. Freddy's dead the final nightmare is also scarier. W.e.s Craven's new nightmare is also scarier. But still this is a very scary movie. It has a great story line. It as great acting. It as great special effects. Freddy is a ghost so I consider this horror fantasy. If you do not get scared off this movie then No movie will scary you. This is a great movie.

42,paulclaassen,Not as good.,3,2 July 2018,"The last of the Elm Street kids are in a psychiatric hospital. Good visuals, but the story is fragments of ideas put together. The eeriness of the original is gone.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
43,Rodrigo_Amaro,One Flew Over Freddy's Nest,6,8 June 2013,"Possibly the funniest film in the series (of the ones I've seen). Funny in a great way, let us not jump to conclusions and say this is a ridiculous flick cause it's not. Some of its choices certainly are and for its own sake it should be sold and advertised as a comedy rather than a horror film because...let's face it, it doesn't scare at any point. It's what we call here as being a ""Terrir"" (a Portuguese cross between the words terror and laughs, given to laughable horror movies). It has its horror elements but it doesn't cause any effect on you except hilarious laughs. ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors"" has some new victims for Freddy Krueger (the eternal Robert Englund) and some old ones too. And they're all gathered in this group therapy of a psychiatric hospital after seeing Krueger in their nightmares. One of the poor kids is a girl (Patricia Arquette) who seems to be able to control part of her dreams and make connections with the other suffering teens through their dreams. Who's gonna help them besides her? A dedicated doctor (Craig Wasson) and an intern (Heather Langenkamp) which we know as being one of the very few survivors of Krueger insane attacks, she was right there in the first film. Not much of a fun idea seeing these unfortunate kids being sitting ducks there in the hospital just waiting for the horrifying creature to haunt them in their sleep, but it's really creative the way those kids were composed, you care for them and their disabilities. There's truth in their performances as crazy as it may sound. Craig Wasson, we all know from ""Body Double"" has never been better than in here, and Laurence Fishburne steals the show as one of the hospital nurses. Highest point comes to Dick Cavett and Zsa Zsa Gabor cameo which turns into another trick created by Freddy. Had me laughing for a long time. The only genuine horror element that truly deserves appreciation comes from Patricia Arquette. If she was the one who did all that screaming, boy, she has some powerful lungs. But other than that, the third Nightmare on Elm Street is flawed in its horrific purposes. Englund as Freddy isn't much special in here, except for some hysterical lines here and there. Making a puppet out of a kid or the television killing (just to mention a few) might be a good and original way to present as Freddy's casualties but it doesn't work much due to its poor special effects. We're not scared, we're laughing and loudly of those. But still. Kudos to Frank Darabont, one of the writers of this, already showing his ability to leave us concentrated in one particular place, sort of trade-mark more successful in his Stephen King's adaptations of ""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""The Mist"" and ""The Green Mile"". Something tells me it was this special touch that really kept me going in watching this, feeling pity for those kids locked in that facility not knowing how to fight evil.See it as a very humored picture and you won't be disappointed. It had me very entertained and that is something to acknowledge. Way better than seeing the awful and embarrassing follow ups like ""Freddy vs. Jason"". 6/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
44,Dr_Coulardeau,An army is rising against Freddy Krueger,10,2 February 2007,"New director for this third episode. The modern world is growing and we are starting to have the information highway coming into the picture. The new architecture is very striking and powerful. We come back to a girl as the center of the film, but at once that girl is living with her mother and her male guests. But also at once she is moved to a hospital where she meets a whole gang of young people who are Freddy's victims. Freddy does not try to make anyone kill the others. At first he tries to terrorize them into committing suicide. Society reacts as can be expected : the kids are calling for some attention and their dreams and suicides are nothing but the symptoms of their guilt. A junior doctor reacts positively when a psychiatrist comes into the picture, and this psychiatrist is the surviving girl of a preceding episode. This leads to a psychiatric ward in a hospital with all these kids, and group therapy. This time Freddy has a group against him, a group that can remain united, or at least the survivors can, and they can start a war against this Freddy. The film also densifies Freddy Krueger with a mother who was a medical personnel in the old psychiatric ward of the very hospital in which we are. This wing of the building was closed when this young woman was by accident left behind in the ward surrounded by all kinds of crazy criminals. She was raped and many other things and Freddy is her son. Even worse she lost her head, though not completely and could then dedicate the end of her life to religion. She became a nun. The father of the young psychiatrist who has survived Freddy was one of those who burnt Freddy to death when he was caught after kidnapping and killing twenty children. His remains had never been buried. The father will finally accept to tell where the bones are. During that time the kids and the young psychiatrist are getting into the dream to save the others who have been taken and to get rid of Freddy. They will not all come back, but they will come back after Freddy's destruction by the junior doctor burying the bones and sprinkling them with holy water before covering them with earth. It is the first time the Christian theme is brought in with holy water and a crucifix, hence with a parallel to vampires. The film then is a new twist in the general fabric invented by Wes Craven and it is quite effective. We must go on in this saga to see where we are going, where we are taken to. Be sure Freddy will live forever and ever, ever after the end of each film.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
45,filipemanuelneto,It match the original.,7,21 April 2021,"I really liked this film, as it seemed to me a sequel that honors and resonates with the original film. In this film, Freddy Krueger goes back to attack the dreams of the Elm Street teens, but this time they're able to give him a fight. The film does not disappoint the franchise fans and brings everything that is required, including blood, gore and rather macabre scenes, especially towards the end.The cast does its job satisfactorily. Robert Englund is impeccable in the role of the iconic villain, Heather Langenkamp is perfect for the protagonist and Craig Wasson, Patricia Arquette, Ken Sagoes and Rodney Eastman secure the most important supporting characters with confidence and reasonable results. It is not an exceptional work, there are failures and moments when the actors sound excessively cliché, but I think that some of those failures may be due to bad lines and dialogues, and not so much to the effort of the actors themselves.Technically, it is a very well-made film and appears to have a lot of money invested. CGI and special effects are quite good and worked very well, especially the skeleton. Englund's make-up also looks more realistic and detailed than in other older films, and that makes it clearer, more disturbing and impactful. There is some room for pleasant black humor, but the film is genuinely tense and the suspense was built in a coherent and skillful manner. Dark cinematography with strong colors helps, at the right times, to accentuate this tension, and the soundtrack also plays an honorable role.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

Then, we have the return of Heather and Badalamenti on the soundtrack ! The story is original as it happens inside of a psychiatric ward and the locations are beautiful ! This team of dreams warriors is cool : each teen has its personality and it was funny to hear again about role playing games !! the story is really believable and gripping and the special effects are just awesome ! Sure we know it's fake but there is so much craft behind that we really care about them ! For example, the veins puppet is too horrifying for me ! So this part really develops the story and it's a real tense horror movie that doesn't sounds like a spoof !

47,BaronBl00d,Dreams That Can Fight Back,5,17 December 2005,"While in no way a great or particularly good movie, Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors helps one easily forget that the dreadful Part 2 was even ever made. It is not nearly as innovative or suspenseful as the first film but leaps and bounds above the second installment. This time we go back to the original source material and characters from the first film. Pretty Heather Langenkamp is back as young psychiatry intern(did anyone really buy that?)Nancy Thompson. It seems that a group of troubled teens are in a mental hospital for various reasons - most dealing with attempts at killing themselves at some point. Doctors Craig Wasson(giving his standard performance) and officious Priscilla Pointer haven't been able to help these teens, but newcomer Langenkamp has just the right medicine. Or does she? No one was dying until she arrived which is exactly what starts to happen in the hospital. Anyhow, the film becomes rather predictable and pedestrian at this part but manages to stay above the material at times in terms of storytelling, direction, and even to a much lesser degree acting. Director Chuck Russell shows why he received lots of jobs after this(such as The Blob and Bless the Child). He is competent behind the camera. With the exceptions of one dream sequence with John Saxon and one with Zsa Zsa Gabor on the small screen, most of the dream sequences were creatively conceived - still silly but done with some flair. The special effects were much, much, much more realistic than those used in Part 2. The script actually brought home the meat, well, some meat. We get an explanation of why Freddy is the way Freddy is. I found this parallel plot interesting. We get a mysterious character - a nun who has some insights to Freddy. And yes, we get the obligatory death scenes, the tongues wrapped around bedposts, and Freddy cracking out one-liners like he is at the Improv. Before I make this sound too much like fillet mignon, let me make sure I am very clear that it is just a regular, somewhat over-done steak. On the other hand, it's not chopped liver either. As for the acting, Robert Englund does his usual serviceable job. Wasson, Pointer, and Nan Martin stand out as ""adults."" John Saxon is back giving this film some credibility. Lovely Patricia Arquette is an important teen in the mental hospital, and Langenkamp cannot act.She floats through the whole film like a fallen timber. If you like Freddy Kruger, then Part 3 will please you. I was surprised - not because it was only an average film at best, but because it almost obliterated the sour taste in my mouth left by Part 2.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

Revisited it recently on a dvd which I own.
The events of this part takes place one year aft the events of the previous one.
Here the action takes place inside a psychiatric hospital consisting of kids suffering from Freddy's nightmares. Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) from part one joins the hospital as a new intern therapist n she is well aware about the dreams n the kids' turmoil.
The set up of the hospital n the old abandoned junkyard were both creepy n surreal.
The film has brutal n innovative onscreen kills, a decapitation for the first time n one very violent offscreen kill of that of cutting off the eyelids to stay awake.
Surprisingly the film has nudity for the first time.
We r also told about Freddy's origin which is again very shocking n creepy. The film has a cameo appearance by John Saxon. We have two very young fellas, Lawrence Fishburne n Patricia Arquette.
But one of the best stuff is Freddy's dark humor n one liners:

52,insomniac_rod,Have you ever thought about using special powers in your nightmare?,8,25 December 2003,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** THE BEST FREDDY KRUEGER FILM!.""A Nightmare On Elm Street 3 : The Dream Warriors"" apart from being the best film in the ANOES franchise, it's one of the best horror movies of the 80's. Seriously, for a 3rd. insalment this movie is very good. Also, it had the big responsability of returning the originality and quality factor the series after the mid success of part 2. Part 1 is a horror classic, it's almost perfect and that  means big problems when it's intended to create a franchise because it's very hard to match the opera prima. Part 2 did quietly good but never stood a chance compared to the original. ""The Dream Warriors"" was produced with the intention to capitalize the Freddy Krueger phenomenom of the 80's. The film created a strong image for Krueger and gained him a place in the horror icons haven.The good things about THE DREAM WARRIORS:1. Likeable characters with a developed story. Probably the best character development in the series. You can say that you feel sympathy for the children. The actors did a great job by giving life to disturbed children that were afraid for falling asleep, in concrete, they were hugely threatened and scared of Fred Krueger. You feel sorry when one of the dies, it's like you are part of their group. Join Kincaid, Taryn, Brian, Joey, Jennifer, and Kirsten for the ultimate fight between the Elm Street children and Krueger. Kirsten Parker is this time's heroine, she'll be Freddy's deadliest enemy and the key to discover where to attack him in order to defeat him. I want to add that the acting is top notch for the series. I mean, Patricia Arquette, John Saxon, Heather Langerkamp, Laurence Fishburne, Craig Watson, Ken Sagoes, and of course Robert Englund deliver great performances, the best cast in the series.*SPOILERS* 2. A great story. Frank Darabont (which years later was involved in the 94's masterpiece ""The Shawshank Redemption""), and Wes Craven created the PERFECT ANOES script. The best, hands down. Have you ever thought what would be your special powers in your dreams? In this movie these thoughts materialize and you feel related to them. Having powers in your nightmares now it's a more serious issue and it's well treated in the movie. The children know that everytime they sleep their life is in risk, so that means they have to fight for their life using their abilities. Freddy is back and he has to eliminated the last Elm Street children. Freddy attacks them in their dreams, that hasn't changed but now these children are internated in the Westin Hills hospital. The children receive medical attention in order to stop their nightmares and conduct disorders. The doctors don't believe their stories about this skin burned man with a hat, and they attribute their dream problems to a massive psycosis. The Dr. in charge, Neil Gordon    aided by Nancy Thompson believe the children's story and research about Freddy Krueger. Kristen Parker is now Freddy's new victim. Kristen has the special ability to call people for help in her nightmares. This ability is the way to end for once and all with Krueger. Dr. Gordon and Nancy use Kristen's ability to fight Krueger; the children, and Nancy against him in the same nightmare.At the end who will survive? How will they use their special powers against Freddy?The return of the favorite ANOES character, Nancy Thompson was a great addition to the film. Nancy is the first person to ever defeat Krueger and this time she won't be alone. Nancy encourages the Dream Warriors to don't fear Freddy and stay alive. Also, bringing Freddy's mother to the story was a nice and scary element at the same time. Mother Mary Helen is a dark character in the series, and surely plays an important part in this film as she's the key to defeat Freddy. This time Freddy Krueger is not as mean as in the original, but still he knows how to scare and impose his presence. Krueger has gained more abilities and this time he's stronger than ever! That means a difficult job for the Dream Warriors.3. The direction/Score/F/X Visually THE DREAM WARRIORS is perfect for being a horror film. Chuck Russell's direction in no way  matches or is better than Craven's but still it's fantastic, he gave it a fantasy and sci-fi touch to this horror feature. The F/X are great! The puppet death, Jennifer's death, and Freddy's demise are the best scenes where the F/X were needed. The Krueger make-up is decent, but not the best. The score is great, mixing 80's metal pop tracks with the characteristic ANOES themes. It's the perfect soundtrack in a horror movie, a mix between scary themes and rock 'n roll.
4. The best scenes... The puppet death, Freddy's demise, when Kincaid, Joey, Alice, and Nancy escape from Krueger; overall all the deaths. The ending is chilling and in my opinion, is the best in the series. *END OF SPOILERS*Overall this is a great horror film, you can't ask for something better. It's not HALLOWEEN, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, EVIL DEAD, or THE EXORCIST, but still THE DREAM WARRIORS matches the fun factor and the quality.I'd say that this is the best in the series without a doubt.This film inspired in great amount the script, and settings used in FREDDY VS JASON.Watch this film even if you're not a fan of the ANOES series, watch if you are hungry of a good horror film with some dips of sci-fi.Very recommended, 8/10. 10/10 IN THE ANOES SCALE.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
53,arfdawg-1,Horrible,2,20 December 2018,A really poorly written sequel.

The story line is dumb and the acting is miserable.,A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
54,Anonymous_Maxine,"Hey, what ever happened to that music video?",4,28 April 2004,"Unless I'm sadly mistaken, I rented A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 several years ago and there was a music video, I'm pretty sure which was called Dream Warriors, at the end of it, and I rented this one on DVD hoping that the video would be there because it was one of the funniest things I've ever seen. It's amazing how stuff from the 80s is so funny now, but nothing is funnier than 80s rap videos. There was this rap group singing that song Dream Warriors on the VHS version of this movie after the credits, and they're all wearing like denim jackets with no shirt underneath and form fitting jean shorts that are all frayed at the bottoms like Daisy Dukes. What could make a rap group look more foolish I can't imagine.(spoilers) At any rate, I was disappointed in looking for that video on the DVD version, so all I had was this mediocre installment in the Freddy Krueger series. The movie sort of starts off with the same idea as part 2, with the main character witnessing all kinds of gruesome murders and then sort of coming out of a trance and finding himself with the bloody hands. Kristen Parker (Patricia Arquette) has a nightmare about the infamous house that Nancy Thompson used to live in, then runs to the bathroom, the sink's handles turn into Freddy's hands and attack her, and then she wakes up standing in her bathroom having slit her own wrists. From there, the movie turns into the usual mental hospital installment. `Larry' Fishburne, tired of always playing the bad guy in his roles, was happy to take on the role in this film as a nice-guy orderly, stern but accommodating when the patients want to bend the rules a little. Not surprisingly, he turns in what is by leaps and bounds the best performance in the movie. Arquette later goes on to become an accomplished actor, but had not perfected her acting skills when she starred in this film. The characters in the movie are mostly all patients at the mental hospital that Kristen is placed into after cutting her wrists. All of them are cynical and uncooperative, almost none believing that they really belong there at all. Eventually, they realize and are able to convince the staff that they are all having dreams about the same man and it's not just some kind of group hysteria.Heather Langenkamp has returned in her famous role as Nancy Thompson, this time grown up into a dream researcher as a result of her childhood experiences involving Freddy Krueger. Not surprisingly, she is able to quickly relate to the hysterical Kristen and the rest of the patients, since she had experienced exactly what they're going through. There are some interesting murders in this installment, and the technology used for the special effects have taken a huge jump. There is a gigantic, worm-like Freddy that tries to swallow Kristen whole, there is a scene where a television turns into Freddy and with mechanical arms he picks up one of the patients there for some late night entertainment and punishes her for sitting too close to the TV, but there is also an unconvincing go-motion scene where a couple guys have a fight with Freddy Krueger's skeleton, which has been rotting in the trunk of some car in a car junkyard. And one of the more groan-inducing scenes was one where Freddy attacks one of the patients in his dream (the one famous for sleepwalking), tearing the muscles and tendons out of his arms and legs and leading him around like a puppet. Ouch.We get a peek into Freddy's past in this installment. Not only do we meet his mother, but we also find out the circumstances that led to Freddy being fathered by more than 100 maniacs. In fighting Freddy, the patients all band together and, in their dreams, use their special powers (most of which reflect their shortcomings in real life) to fight him. One student, bound to a wheelchair, is able to walk in his dreams, another has the hilarious powers of what he calls the `Wizard Master,' another is `beautiful and bad' (she has lots of makeup, her hair stands up in a foot-high Mohawk, and she has knives). Clever, but the movie falters when it has only one of the patients, the one who can't speak, not have any powers in his dreams until the climax of the movie, when he suddenly realizes that he can talk in his dreams (at just the right moment to save the day). His dream power was a little too obvious to have been left out for that long, but collectively, now you see why the movie was subtitled Dream Warriors.
Altogether, this is not an entirely weak entry into the series. The acting is pretty shoddy, but it's actually pretty good for a horror movie. Larry Fishburne vastly overshadows the rest of the cast, displaying wonderful acting skills early on in his career, and the movie is not simply a rehash of either of the first two  a problem that plagues the Friday the 13th movies much more than the Elm Street films. The characters are never developed enough to allow for the later creation of much tension, which is why most of the deaths come across more as creative ways to kill off someone in a horror film than the tragic loss of the life of one of the characters that we've come to know and root for their triumph over evil. But then again, not a lot of horror movies take the time to really develop their characters to the point where you throw up your hands in defeat when they are killed, or are on the edge of your seat as they run for their lives. But it's important to note that the few horror films that actually do that are almost invariably the best ones",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

56,FiendishDramaturgy,Craven's back!!,8,2 April 2004,"Well, they obviously realized where they went wrong with NOES2 and brought back the wizard of weird, Horror Maven Wes Craven. And just in the nick of time. I don't think this franchise would have survived another screen play by David Chaskin.""Dream Warriors"" original screenplay was written totally by Craven, and he was he executive producer this time.Dream Warriors definitely puts Freddy back on the right track with a solid story and innovatives in both effects and story ideas.""Sleep. Those little slices of Death. How I loathe them."" Edgar Allen Poe. This is how we are reintroduced to the Nightmare.A common element between the first and this chapter of the NOES franchise is that of distant mothers. Nancy's mother was distracted and detached from her child, as is Kristen's mother. I find that to be a particular contrivance, as it allows the story line to flow without a high level of interference from the parent gallery. Otherwise, these kids would have been restrained, sedated and institutionalized.Speaking of institutionalization. Just when it becomes apparent that there is no more story to keep this franchise going, Craven and the other writers pull the fat out of the fire, so to speak by introducing the ""Dream Warriors."" Very nice premise which I won't spoil here, but this is the installment in which you begin to put together the why's and wherefore's. This chapter also has a purpose; a goal, if you will. As Craven begins the methodical rebuilding of the Freddy Bible, some rules are laid down, giving this segment the structure which was so sorely lacking in the second.Celebrate the return of both Heather Langencamp AND Wes Craven and return to the Nightmare the way it was meant to be with great performances, a hideous villain and a lovely dark story line. But this movie also offers some strong, convincing and realistic effects; not enough to overshadow the story, but just enough to properly enhance it. (I, personally, LOVED the barking pig!) While there are a few slow spots, they are few in number and brief in duration. All in all, I have to say that A Nightmare on Elm Street III: Dream Warriors is a most worthy sequel in the Freddy Franchise. (Just forget they made a second one. They play very well 1-3. You never even miss the second one.) Did this one scare? This one actually had the jump on the first one a far as scares. Several seat jumps were experienced.It rates an 8.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
57,Stevieboy666,Dream of a sequel,8,27 July 2018,"After the somewhat disappointing part 2 this, the second Elm St sequel, steps the franchise up to a new level. The sets and special effects are awesome, plentiful, inventive and fun. In particular I liked a scene with a fighting skeleton, certainly a nod to Ray Harryhausen. Great to see Heather Langenkamp & John Saxon return, plus it marked the debut of Patricia Arquette, and Lawrence Fishburne can also be seen. 
Dream Warriors marked the point where Freddy became humorous, something which I felt got taken too far in further sequels, but thankfully here he balances that with still being a scary, bad ass. This, in my opinion, is the second best entry in the series, the first being numero uno. I can remember first watching this when it came out on VHS as a teen and thinking how lucky Joey was when the sexy blonde nurse hit on him. All these years later I still think the same!

58,kevin_robbins,This is an all time great,9,23 July 2021,"A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987) is movie I recently watched on HBOMAX and tells the tale of several children locked in the same ward that are experiencing similar dreams. Lucky for them Nancy from the first Nightmare on Elm Street recently got a degree in the sleep field and is here to help them conquer their nightmares...literally. This movie is directed by Chuck Russell (The Mask) and stars Robert Englund (Hatchet), Heather Langenkamp (Hellraiser: Judgement), Patricia Arquette (True Romance), Ken Sagoes (The Bernie Mac Show) and Laurence Fishburne (Boys in the Hood). The storyline and characters in this top to bottom are excellent and this is right there with the first film as the best in the series. The primary storyline followed by surprise reappearances by Nancy and her father are so well done. The casting is perfect and the script and dialogue is way better than it should be. There are three iconic horror classic scenes in this - the television scene, the ""let's get high"" scene and the tongue scene that all go in the horror hall of fame. Kincaid is also one of my all time favorite horror movie characters. This is another one in the series I'd score a 9/10 and consider an all time great.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
59,dee.reid,"""Dream Warriors"": Better than the average horror sequel?",7,17 October 2009,"Wes Craven's ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" (1984) is unquestionably one of the greatest horror movies of all time. It's my favorite slasher movie of all time, and Fred Krueger is my all-time favorite slasher movie villain. ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" has been followed by six sequels, a television series, a 2003 cross-over flick (""Freddy vs. Jason""), and a 2010 remake. Like most horror film series, the sequels got worse with each subsequent entry; the ""Nightmare"" series is no different.The worst thing to be said about the ""Nightmare"" sequels was that as time went on, the image of the series chief antagonist, Fred Krueger (Robert Englund), was softened in an attempt to appeal to a mass audience. A spectral, razor-fingered night-monster who stalked teenagers in their dreams, he was first presented as a humorous sadist who took pleasure in torturing his teenage victims. He didn't hide behind a mask - one of my favorite characteristics about him - and if he was going to kill you in your dreams, he wanted you to know it was him. But as time went on, his image was softened and he became more comical and less scary; he later became known as ""Freddy Krueger"" (as opposed to the more menacing ""Fred Krueger""), he cracked dark-humored jokes, he got somewhat sillier, and he got more screen time.It was interesting to note that in the first film, he was a true force to be reckoned with; he redefined modern horror villainy. And he got very little screen time. Craven's inventive use of shadows, his focus more on characters and story rather than gore and special effects, and blending of dreams and reality made ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" a new standard for the slasher genre in the early '80s.Wes Craven parted way with the series after the 1984 original, but had some hand in writing the screenplay for 1987's ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors""; some other notable future talents also had a hand in developing this film's script, one of whom was none other than Frank Darabont (director of ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" ""The Green Mile""). Director Chuck Russell also worked on the screenplay, which has some moments of ingenuity, but still falls into being a typical horror sequel with some inventive flourishes.Krueger is still haunting the dreams of teenagers and offing them in some pretty creative and gruesome ways while they sleep. Here, he's systematically eliminating the last of the Elm Street children, all of whom are sharing the same collective nightmare while staying inside a psychiatric hospital. The hospital staff are cold and distant, and disbelieving the teens' assertions that someone is trying to kill them in their dreams. Only Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp), sole survivor of the original ""Nightmare"" film, believes their story, and she forms sympathetic links with some of the patients, including Kristen Parker (Patricia Arquette), the violent loner Kincaid (Ken Sagoes), the mute Joey (Rodney Eastman), recovering drug addict Taryn (Jennifer Rubin), and the nerdy paraplegic Will (Ira Heiden). Nancy also forms a close bond with Dr. Neil Gordon (Craig Wasson), the doctor assigned to look after the kids, and Max (Larry Fishburne), the orderly with a lackadaisical attitude about his job.Nancy eventually teaches the kids, including the most gifted of all Kristen, to turn the tide of their life-and-death struggles by unlocking their ""dream powers,"" special abilities only available to them in their dreams so that they can battle Krueger on his own terms and turf. And somewhere in there, we eventually learn of the horrific origins of Fred Krueger himself.This is not a bad film, even though it tends to get a bit silly at times, which I guess is part of the package, being that it's a sequel and all. Many fans consider this film and ""New Nightmare"" (1994) to really be the only sequels worth watching and for some reason, I agree fully. I was glad to see Heather Langenkamp back in the series as Nancy Thompson. She was by far the best thing about the original film, with her girl-power attitude to fight back against an unspeakable evil, and her quick-thinking resourcefulness also won me over. Without her, I don't think I even would have bothered with this film.It's also interesting to note the number of future Hollywood talents here, including Patricia Arquette, who would go on to star in my favorite movie of all time, ""True Romance"" (1993), and would also appear on the television show ""Medium."" Larry Fishburne would also go on to be a top Hollywood talent as well, most notably starring as Morpheus in the ""Matrix"" films. Director Chuck Russell would also make ""The Mask"" (1994) and ""Eraser"" (1996).All in all, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors"" is not a bad film, nor a bad horror sequel. It's just a sign of the times of what the slasher genre had become by 1987, old and stale. But it's nowhere near the disaster it could have been, like many of the other sequels in the ""Nightmare"" series.7/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

It also tells more of Freddy's back-story as the child of a nun who is assaulted by dozens of mental patients.This film also has the return of Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) from the first movie.

64,Foreverisacastironmess123,"""You should listen to your mother!""",9,31 October 2018,"This is my second favourite film of this series, right behind the first one. It was such a strong return to form following the bizarre, off-putting nonsense of ""Freddy's Revenge"", and unlike that movie, it was a sequel that was very much worthy of and stayed true to what was so brilliant about the original, bringing the focus back to the hellish dreams via outlandish nightmare scenarios that creepily seep into reality, as well as Nancy's conflict with Freddy, and in its own way I think it expanded on and nicely wrapped up what Craven had started. This would have been a great place to end the Nightmare movies on, as it does have good closure, but uh no way Jose, by this point we had a bonified horror movie pop culture legend on our hands, and that unquiet spirit weren't going nowhere! This movie mostly plays like a very dark fantasy and just oozes with that awesome old 80s magic horror flair, and I love it for the highly effective and distinctive music score which gives it a lot of added depth and creepy atmosphere as well as a unique feel within the series, the characters, and most of all definitely the nightmares! It so greatly added to what Freddy was capable of in such a spectacularly visual way, and for me those dazzling dream death sequences are the definite highlight. When I was a kid several of those scenes like the killer sink, snake, melting tricycle, just about scared me to death, and watching it recently I see that a lot of effort was put into those scenes to make them feel more surreal and unsettling, with the most disturbingly effective one for me being when Freddy spends several sweet seconds as the most damn bone-chilling puppet ever before tearing the tendons out of an unfortunate guy's arms and legs and making him march to his death like some kind of grotesque human marionette! The injuries are horrifying enough, but the way the sequence is edited with the distorted music and that ghastly ""woo woo woo"" pulsing sound makes for a phenomenally nightmarish visual and that whole sequence still genuinely gives me the creeps! I think it has a great balance between the fun and the horror, it has the sillier moments but it's all juxtaposed very well with a more serious undertone, and things don't get too overly silly and campy, that would come later as the movies progressed! This movie is responsible for beginning the more clownish showman Freddy that became such a firm horror icon, and to this day some don't like that approach to him, but I personally think that Robert Englund had such a naturally mischievous and animated face that it was really somewhat inevitable that Freddy Kruegar would evolve in such a way. He may not be as menacing, but he sure was a lot you're entertaining, and I do personally like the wisecracking Freddy better just because it's plain to see how much more Englund enjoyed playing him that way. Anyway I find it such a visual appealing film and the cinematography of it is terrific, contrasting the coldness of the institute with the twisted dream netherworld, to the bright daytime exterior scenes that mainly take the form of the saddening graveside funerals of the young victims. Said victims are actually all pretty good and likeable characters who each have their own personalities and are not just kill fodder, you care about them because they're just messed up kids who are stuck in an institute because of Freddy and are trying to look out for each other, but are losing. You feel the sadness of their deaths and that's a real rarity with these kinds of movies. I liked her a tiny bit more the first time around but it was so cool how they brought back Nancy and how she had the same great quality about herself that really made her character someone you could root for. My favourite character though was actually Craig Wasson as Dr Neil Gordon, a skeptical man of science, who with the help of the grave spirit of Freddy's mother in an excellent and haunting subplot, becomes a believer as the film unfolds and eventually banishes Freddy by performing the last rites on his charred bones as the action of the dreamscape and the real world cleverly converges... In the spooky final scene, when the light comes on in the model Elm Street house as Neal sleeps, I think it's Nancy's spirit watching over him not Freddy coming back, because her dream doll is in the shot. So in closing, while there are some elements that work a little better than others, I still love the hell out of this movie, and I find it to easily be one of the very best Freddy pictures, and to me a real 80s horror classic in its own right.

The look and feel are so EIGHTIES that it's almost like watching back something I'd forgotten I had seen. That said, I thought the movie was way more complicated than it needed to be. Freddy became an icon, and part of it was because he started using sarcastic one liners beginning with this film. But even though it was a success at the time, I disagree with everyone who found this a satisfying sequel. Not being a fan of ""kills,"" or Freddy in general, I was looking more for a well told story. The movie built fairly well, but the final sequences were over complicated. It tried to pack too many twists and revelations into the ending, so that it just became a mess. I'm also deducting points because of how some of the characters end up--I wanted it to turn out differently.

69,aidanratesmovies,"Uneven, but has its moments",7,23 May 2020,"Uneven in total, but with some admirable qualities, A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 is easier to take seriously than the second film in the franchise, but ultimately is too messy to prove to be anything than just an average sequel. The film does start out strong, and continues that strong nature until about halfway through the film. During that first half, writer Frank Darabont (writer of The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, and many other classic films) presence is uniquely shown as his atmosphere of the film is brilliantly captured and provides quite a suspenseful and interesting nature that no film like it dared to try before. However, about halfway through, things begin to fall apart, and the film begins to lead on a predictable and quite tedious journey to its closing credits that is truly not very fun to watch. I struggled to pay attention during the second half, as the pacing took a major dip, and I began to wonder why one film felt so different as it went on. The film is written by 4 different people, and I assume it is because of this reason, and many other production circumstances, that the film doesn't hold together well as a whole. However, that isn't to say it's terrible. Besides the atmosphere in the film, there are plenty of redeemable qualities that are the heights of the franchise. The acting is the best in the series so far; with Patricia Arquette, Jennifer Rubin, and Laurence Fishburne providing the most notable performances of the film. It's set designs can be a bit dull at time, but in the first half of the film, the tone of the film is captured just right, and the script in that half is also very tightly written, and even somewhat inciteful. In the end, A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 is far from perfect, and is not as good as I heard it to be.

71,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Strong Sequel to my Favorite Villain,9,2 April 2019,"This sequel was one that I had originally seen growing up on the movie channels. The original terrified me and this one really helped me handle the series at a younger age as it brought the comedy. Before getting into that, the official synopsis is a psychiatrist familiar with knife-wielding dream demon Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) helps teens at a mental hospital battle the killer who is invading their dreams.We start off with a young woman building a papier-mâché house. She is Kristen Parker (Patricia Arquette). Kristen is doing everything that she can to stay awake and this draws the attention of her mother. She scolds her for still being up and gets her into bed. We hear that she has a guest and we get the idea that Kristen could be acting out. After falling asleep, she goes to the house she was making which is Freddy's. In the nightmare she flees from him and wakes up. She goes to her bathroom to find out she is still asleep. Her mother comes in after hearing the screaming to what looks like a suicide attempt.The film then shifts to a mental hospital where there are a group of teens that are seeing the same figure in their dreams. The doctors in charge are Neil Gordon (Craig Wasson) and Dr. Elizabeth Simms (Priscilla Pointer). Helping them is an orderly Max (Laurence Fishburne). These teens are all from different walks of life, but dealing with Freddy. The staff thinks it's a group psychosis. Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) is a grad student who thinks otherwise. She wants help them find a way to defeat Freddy once and for all.I will lead off here stating that this is my favorite film in the series behind the original. Part of that is Freddy isn't as scary in the first two, but this one is the balancing of horror and comedy. The setting also helps to build that fear. They are stuck together in a mental hospital where they can't get out and Dr. Simms makes it worse by not only locking their doors but sedating them, making them helpless against Freddy.There are a group of diverse characters which I also like. The film states that they are the last of the Elm Street kids, which I can take or leave there. This really only comes up when they are referring to Nancy's father Lt. Thompson (John Saxon). This actually makes sense with later mythology though that Freddy can only spread through fear. Now all of these teens were seeing him before coming in, but if they live in the same area it would fit.Pacing for the film also helps this out as well. Kristen is attacked in the first fifteen minutes. From there we move to the hospital and every night someone else is attacked. The fear builds and we gets layers of it. The teens are terrified to fall asleep for fear of what will come with their dreams. The doctors are worried that the children not sleeping are causing them to go crazy and kill themselves. Nancy knows that Freddy is back since Kristen pulled her into a dream with him. There is quite a climatic conclusion to all of this that I thought was pretty solid as well. I love the way that Freddy is defeated in this one. It would have been a perfect end to the series, even though by introducing Sister Mary Helena, it gave the start to build even more mythology.This film also included a new angle of the Dream Warriors. When we sleep, we often have abilities that we don't have in the real world. Kristen becomes quite important here as she can bring other people into her dreams, which they believe will give them an advantage against Freddy.Acting in this film I think is good. Langenkamp gets a lot of grief and I'll admit that she isn't great. I think a strong part of this film is that I don't think she is the star. She is more of the wise person who gives knowledge to the heroes. I would say that the two stars of this film are Wasson and Arquette. Wasson is great because he doesn't believe, but he sees how passionate everyone else is. The more that happens, the more he realizes the truth. Arquette does disappear as the film progresses, but her power is important even until the end. Englund was great in this film. He wasn't as scary as previous installments, but he really embodies the character. The rest of the dream warriors are interesting in their own way and add their touch to the film. I want to shout out a young Fishburne and Pointer. The latter was great as the woman who is really out to help these teens, but doesn't realize what is really happening.The effects for this film are great. They were done practically and some of the things that were done did not look easy. The attacks on people are great and do look quite real. I personally am a firm believer that what makes this film scary is that all the deaths should look like suicides. As the film progresses, it does get away from that, but the longer they keep that going, the better. Some of these deaths have me cringing, even after this last viewing. There are a lot of people who hate the stop motion of the skeleton at the end of the film, I personally don't mind it. It isn't as good as films from even before this, but I have a soft spot. I do have to point out that I love puppet Freddy, Taryn's (Jennifer Rubin) death and Phillip's (Bradley Gregg) death as some of my favorite effects.Score for the film is also pretty interesting. The rhyme about Freddy is used quite a bit. It is always nice to incorporate that. The rest of the score didn't really stand out. It does fit the scenes for what they needed though, I will give it that. I love the theme song to this film though, it is so 80's hair metal which is great.Now with that said, this film is great. It isn't perfect, it does have some flaws to it, but I think they are minor. I love the concept of these teens who are trying to stay awake to stay alive going to a mental hospital. The deaths looking like suicide making the doctors think that it is just them descending into madness. Freddy becomes the icon he is today, which is good even though we lose some of the terror. The acting is good and the pacing is as well. The effects for me were great. Score for the film didn't really stand out, but the use of the Freddy rhyme is great as is the theme song. Overall I'd say this is a good film. I recommend this whether you are a fan of the franchise or not.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

The doctors in charge are Neil Gordon (Craig Wasson) and Dr. Elizabeth Simms (Priscilla Pointer). Helping them is an orderly Max (Laurence Fishburne). These teens are all from different walks of life, but dealing with the same entity. The staff thinks it's a group psychosis. Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) is a grad student who thinks otherwise. She wants help them find their inner strength to defeat Freddy once and for all.I will lead off here stating that this is my favorite film in the series behind the original. Part of that is Freddy isn't as scary in the first two, but this one is the balancing of horror and comedy. He really becomes the icon that we all know today thanks to this film. The setting also helps to build that fear. They are stuck together in a mental hospital where they can't get out and Dr. Simms makes it worse by not only locking their doors but sedating them, making them helpless against Freddy by not being able to wake up or stay awake.There are a group of diverse characters which I also like. The film states that they are the last of the Elm Street kids, which I can take or leave there. This really only comes up when they are referring to Nancy's father Lt. Thompson (John Saxon) and when Nancy is telling the kids in group. This actually makes sense with later mythology though that Freddy can only spread through fear. A gripe that people have with a lot of horror films is when the killer is toying with them. Being kept alive by fear, Freddy would have to do this. Now all of these teens were seeing him before coming in, but if they live in the same area it would fit. It is curious they don't know each other though.Pacing for the film also helps this out as well. Kristen is attacked in the first fifteen minutes. From there we move to the hospital and every night someone else is attacked. The fear builds and we get layers of it. The teens are terrified to fall asleep for fear of what will come with their dreams. The doctors are worried that the children not sleeping are causing them to go crazy and kill themselves. Nancy knows that Freddy is back since Kristen pulled her into a dream with him. There is quite a climatic conclusion to all of this that I thought was pretty solid as well. I love the way that Freddy is defeated in this one. It would have been a perfect end to the series, even though by introducing Sister Mary Helena and Amanda Kruger, it gave the start to build even more mythology.This film also included a new angle of the Dream Warriors. When we sleep, we often have abilities that we don't have in the real world. Kristen becomes quite important here as she can bring other people into her dreams, which they believe will give them an advantage against Freddy.Acting in this film I think is good. Langenkamp gets a lot of grief and I'll admit that she isn't great. I think a strong part of this film is that I don't think she is the star. She is more of the wise person who gives knowledge to the heroes. She is better in this film though than the original, I will say that. I would say that the two stars of this film are Wasson and Arquette. Wasson is great because he doesn't believe, but he sees how passionate everyone else is. The more that happens, the more he realizes the truth. Arquette does disappear as the film progresses, but her power is important. Englund was great in this film. He wasn't as scary as previous installments, but he really embodies the character. The rest of the dream warriors are interesting in their own way and add their touch to the film. I want to shout out a young Fishburne and Pointer. The latter was great as the woman who is really out to help these teens, but doesn't realize what is really happening.The effects for this film are great. They were done practically and some of the things that were done did not look easy. The attacks on people are great and do look quite real. I personally am a firm believer that what makes this film scary is that all the deaths should look like suicides. As the film progresses, it does get away from that, but the longer they keep that going, the better. Some of these deaths have me cringing, even after this last viewing. There are a lot of people who hate the stop motion of the skeleton at the end of the film, I personally don't mind it. It isn't as good as films from even before this, but I have a soft spot. I do have to point out that I love puppet Freddy, Taryn's (Jennifer Rubin) death and Phillip's (Bradley Gregg) death as some of my favorite effects.Score for the film is also pretty interesting. The rhyme about Freddy is used quite a bit. It is always nice to incorporate that. The rest of the score didn't really stand out. It does fit the scenes for what they needed though, I will give it that. I love the theme song to this film though, it is so 80's hair metal which is great.Now with that said, this film is great. It isn't perfect, it does have some flaws to it, but I think they are minor. I love the concept of these teens who are trying to stay awake to stay alive going to a mental hospital. The deaths looking like suicide making the doctors think that it is just them descending into madness. Freddy becomes the icon he is today, which is good even though we lose some of the terror. The acting is good and the pacing is as well. The effects for me were great. Score for the film didn't really stand out, but the use of the Freddy rhyme is great as is the theme song. Overall I'd say this is a good film. I recommend this whether you are a fan of the franchise or not.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
73,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,More of what A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge (1985) should have been,7,17 May 2015,"It's a rare case when a sequel makes a comeback in a franchise that begins going downhill in quality. Unfortunately with the law of diminishing returns it's not easy for that to happen. When audiences start figuring out that the connections between stories are not being regarded and nothing new is being added to create a cohesive part by part saga, they begin to ignore and not support the cause. Once that happens, it becomes very difficult for the name to come back with something that'll make everyone forget the bad taste that was put in peoples' mouths. Yet for horror franchises, it's much harder for this issue to occur since many just went to view the picture for the kills. But this is a unique case where the third entry (which usually is the worst in a trilogy) ended up being better than the second.However, the only big problem this installment has is where it lies in the timeline. The title suggest that it takes place after A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge (1985) yet throughout the running time, nothing is mentioned about the events of this film's first predecessor (which also happened to acknowledge the original). Plus the original had a false ending so how did Nancy escape Krueger at the end of A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)? This makes it confusing because many Krueger fans believe that Part 2 shouldn't exist, but it was made, so with this productions four writers, something could've been quickly added in to reference the last film. Besides this though, the rest of the writing works aggressively at making sure its audience will enjoy and care more about this set of characters than the last movie. When a bunch of kids start suffering from dangerous dreams at a mental ward headed by Neil Gordon (Craig Wasson), Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) returns to help the struggling fatigued youths fight back against Freddy Krueger using the powers of their dreams.The reason behind Krueger attacking these kids is that they are all that remain of the Elm Street kids of the parents that killed Freddy. This time, the motivation for Freddy is clear. Why not for Part 2? We'll never know. Making his directing debut and partially writing for this entry is the underrated Chuck Russell. Co-writing with Russell is the return of Wes Craven, Bruce Wagner and future 3 time Oscar nominated Frank Darabont. For this alone, it only feels right that the story has more substance this time around. Having John Saxon and Heather Langenkamp reprise their roles was a major plus and the new set of youth or dream warriors as they call themselves, are certainly more charismatic than the last bunch from Part 2. The dream warriors consist of Roland (Ken Sagoes) the tough guy, Joey (Rodney Eastman) the mute, Taryn (Jennifer Rubin) the punk, Phillip (Bradley Gregg) the geek, Kristen (Patricia Arquette) the believer and a couple others all of which have a distinct personalities. Heck even Laurence Fishburne has role in this movie!Veteran actress Nan Martin plays a specific role that is pretty creepy for the story. Again Langenkamp and Saxon provide just the right amount of nostalgia for the fans so that they have plenty to fall back on from the original film. Even Craig Wasson's character is quite useful through the story. Of course we can't forget Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger himself. Like every time before, Englund looks like he's having a blast and any line that he says is darkly funny in its own right. The writing also includes more interesting scenes whether it be the dream sequences or back story information to Freddy Krueger. It additionally doesn't follow the normal horror tropes either which is commendable. The dream sequences whether it be the kills or the act of fighting back go hand- in-hand with the special/practical effects and cinematography shot by Roy H. Wagner. This makes the dream scenes and kills much more creative, diverse and gruesome than the prior entry. Lastly, the only other element besides continuity that doesn't sit well with this sequel is the musical score composed by Angelo Badalamenti. Future horror composer Christopher Young composed the musical score from Part 2 and sadly it was a let down. This was due to Young omitting the original A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) theme composed by Charles Bernstein. For this score, Badalamenti reprises the creepy main theme that composer Bernstein created. except it feels rather shoehorned in a couple times than it is effectively put into the right places. Along with that are horror cues that sound even more synth keyboard emphasized that Bernstein's score. It might be more accurate to say that it resembled that of Richard and Charles Band production quality; it really sounds cheap. This is baffling considering everything else with this entry had such better quality, the music should have received a boost as well, but it didn't.The continuity is vague in its timeline placement and the musical score sounds cheaper than usual even with the return of the memorable creepy theme. However, with better dream sequences, kills, a cast of new dreamers, the return of original characters and a story with more clear motivations, this sequel gets very close to the original.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
74,justin-fencsak,The movie that put this series on the map.,10,30 August 2020,"Three years after A Nightmare on Elm Street and its follow up sequel made Wes Craven the horror king of the 1980s, Dream Warriors came out and became profitable, forcing a fourth film to be made to be released the following year, a trend which lasted until 1989. In 1991, the first 3-d entry in the series, Freddie's Dead, came out, soon to be followed by Wes Craven's New Nightmare three years after that. It took 12 years for Freddy to meet Jason in their highest grossing movie ever, and then got rebooted for each character, each with diminishing results. The title song by Dokken is a classic, and Patricia Arquette is hot in her film debut. The effects are very good and the scares are not that cheap. It is a movie not for kids.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
75,PredragReviews,"""Sorry kid, I don't believe in fairy tales''",7,4 May 2016,"""A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors"" is probably my personal favorite in the series. It's got a decent script, great concept, and it's entertaining as hell. Both chilling and funny, this is a movie to watch if you want a good time. This particular ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" has a rather ingenious storyline; possibly the most creative in the series. The ""survivors"" of Elm Street are slowly falling victim to Krueger's violent rampage one by one (although the deaths are considered ""suicides"" by the doctors). Only a few remain alive in a psychiatric ward and they all have similar nightmares. They all dream of a man who is horribly scarred and wears a glove with razor blades for fingers. And they know that he is out to get them. However, these aren't your typical survivors. They have special powers and gifts in their dream world that makes them unique and powerful. These gifts and powers may be the only thing that can stop Freddy once and for all, before he murders each and every one of them.The acting is much better than in part 2, especially from beautiful actress Patricia Arquette as troubled but unique Kristen who gives heart to the franchise and who brings the group together when under extreme strain. Langenkamp is better too than the first film with less whining and is more brave this time around and has true moments of emotion. Another top performer is Jennifer Rubin as ex drug addict Taryn who plays as a loner who tries desperately to stay clean even when life is so hard and the strain gets worse as the nightmares do, others should look at her performance at how to play a drug addict. The other teens are all decent but not as memorable and Ken Sagoes as Kincaid is a tad annoying. Of course we have Robert Englund as Kruger again and this time is more chilling than before and uses the humor and puns when needed and there is less of a camp feel from him this time,he is still quite wooden but he does grow on you. Finally we briefly have veteran actor John Saxon returning as Nancy's father and again he brings real quality to it even if he's underused.Actually highlight of this movie, is a soundtrack which is really good and mixed in a sounds and mostly music of 80's pop rock stuff. Highlights include the opening tack ('Opening'), and Taryn's Deepest Fear, a jazz/rock influenced number played to highlight her life on the streets. Highly recommended for a fans of horror and music of 80's!Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
76,eric262003,Here's The Sequel We Were Looking For,9,31 October 2021,"From the opening scene in ""A Nightmare on Elm Street3: Dream Warriors"", I knew were in for a treat. This truly was the sequel that was really needed for this franchise which exceeded from the not-so-impressive second part, ""Freddy's Revenge"". Here we find a young teenager named Kristen Parker (Patricia Arquette in her acting debut) situated in front of the old Elm Street house that was the residence of the Thompson family. Only problem is, she's not there physically, it's all in a dream. We see a group of kids frolicing outside the house chanting the infamous Freddy rhyme. As Kristen tries to rescue a little girl on a tricycle as she enters the house, she finds herself in the basement only to end up finding herself face-to-face with the deranged Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund). The dream-stalking fiend plays shape-shifting mindgames in front of the scared teen. Kristen escapes Freddy's path, runs out of the house, with the little she's saving, and makes it outside the house. Only know she discovers that the yard is filled with dead bodies of teenagers with their necks all hung up. But her biggest shock of all is when she looks into the little girl she rescued. This is one of the creepiest introductions of any horror film out there.When Kristen does finally come around to wake up from her dreadful nightmare, she's in the bathroom, standing near the mirror with razor blades in her hand and her wrists were slit open. Her mother (Brooke Bundy) fears she's contemplating suicide and Kristen is now being admitted to a mental institution for troubled teens in hopes they could do something of those terrible dreams. Much to Kristen's shock, the other teens institutionalized have been having the same nightmares with Freddy terrorizing them while they're doing everything they can to keep themselves awake so that Freddy doesn't terrorize them or kill them. Dr. Elizabeth Simms (Pricilla Pointer) and Dr. Neil Gordon (Craig Wasson) suggest they just need proper rest and some dream reducing medicine will help them out. But when the new intern psychologist and specialist in dream pattern Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp from the original movie) enters the scene she knows very well what they are experiencing. After several patients start dying off, it's time for the Dream Warriors to to enter the dream world and defeat this monster once and for all. We also are led to belive that Kristen has a gift of luring people into her dreams which will ensure that Freddy will no longer terrorize kids ever again.What makes this sequel the best of the series is that all the essential elements work to almost perfection. The young cast of then unknowns do a convincing job of conveying fear and frustration knowing that once they fall asleep, Freddy will guarantee no one will wake up again. The dream sequeces is a fun and horrifying fantasy ride with colourful images and is not afraid to go full graphic, including the creepy puppet show. There's also a funny and macabre scene featuring talk show host Dick Cavett and legendary celebrity Zsa Zsa Gabor. We also see the return of Nancy's father Lt. Donald Thompson (John Saxon) who helps Nancy and Dr. Gordon find the remains of Freddy's body. There's also a ghoulish scene where Dr. Gordon encounters a creepy nun (Nan Martin) who eventually we discover that her name is Amanda Krueger, Freddy's mother.And of course there's the life the party himself Freddy Krueger played by the legenadry Robert Englund who not only delivers the kills with such delight, he also delivers wiity, dark one-liners for some black comedy pleasure. He also seems more resourceful in his killings and appearances as he can shift into other manifestations which inclues a giant snake and a marionette which was wonderfully executed thanks to stop-motion animation.This movie definitely stand out was the best of the sequels and the second best movie in the franchise just after the original. This movie was a trailblazer to other slasher films to follow.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
77,Sandcooler,"Little horror, lots of fantasy",7,7 March 2011,"From this entry on, the series just isn't remotely dark or scary anymore. Many have claimed that this is the one true sequel to the original, but apart from Nancy's return there are virtually no comparisons. Does that mean the movie's bad? Hell no, it's actually quite a lot of fun. The characters aren't complex but very sympathetic, which is what every genre film should probably be going for. The kills are also as creative as they've ever been, without having that annoying slapstick feel some of the kills from the later ones have. Krueger even has some non-terrible one-liners in this one, I thought I'd never see the day. The makers also try to keep things a bit occult, but to be frank that aspect doesn't really work out that well. The whole junk yard scene seems taken from some kid's movie, the makers really went overboard there. One more element I liked a lot though: the nun! The outcome to her little B-plot isn't too surprising but still, what a welcome addition to the whole storyline and dare I say, mythology. The original is my favourite, but this is probably second.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

79,moviewizguy,Freddy's just around the corner...,7,3 January 2010,"In a medical facility, seven teenagers who have constant nightmares about child murderer Freddy Krueger undergo monitoring for sleep disorders. But nothing that anyone does seems to help them -- until Nancy Thompson, the heroine of the first movie, joins the medical staff. She suggests that they try a new drug, which inhibits dreaming, on the youngsters. The gullible doctor-in-charge opposes this treatment, forcing Nancy to fight both him and a suspicious nurse in order to save the teens. Meanwhile, Freddy gleefully unleashes one horror-filled image after another to traumatize the patients...until they fear that this is one nightmare they'll never wake up from again.ANOES 3 is one of the better sequels in this ever-so-popular franchise revolving around a man who kills teenagers in their dreams. And why is that? Part of it is due to Wes Craven returning to write the script, along with the soon to be successful Frank Darabont, and Heather Langenkamp returning as a lead (or supporting) role. Compared to the dreadful sequel before, ANOES 3 seems like a masterpiece. There is so much more focus on the characters themselves and some new things being explored that keeps this movie fresh.There is, no doubt, some more elaborate nightmare sequences, which help the movie. Freddy also spews a lot more witty one-liners that has become famous in the franchise. There's also an ensemble cast to root for because all of them are really great and unique in their own way. Heather Langenkamp does a great job as Nancy, as always, along with Robert Englund. Patricia Arquette and Laurence Fishburne are probably the most well known stars in the entire franchise and they both do a great job in their roles. Craig Wasson, Ken Sagoes, Rodney Eastman, Jennifer Rubin, Bradley Gregg, and Ira Heiden are all great in their respective roles.As said earlier, what makes this film so good is that it explores more in the mythology that branches out the franchise a little more. This is also a point in the franchise that has a distinctive look. All in all, ANOES 3 is said to be the best sequel in the franchise, although not for me. That would go to part 7. If you're a fan of this franchise, this is a must see.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
80,udar55,Creative entry thank marked a transition for Freddy,7,22 January 2006,"A transitional film for the ELM STREET series, the third entry in the Krueger saga proves to be an entertaining yet somewhat uneven horror film. Featuring good performances, outstanding special effects and a surprisingly astute script this one stands out as the best of the ELM STREET sequels.The script (credited to Wes Craven, Bruce Wagner, Chuck Russell and Frank Darabont) wisely strays from the formula beginning to take shape with pt. 2. That entry featured Kruger haunting a young boy who moved into the old Elm Street house, pushing the series dangerously close to being nothing more than a stalk n' slash. Part 3 thankfully brings things back around, re-introducing main characters from the first film (Nancy and her father). More importantly, this entry advances the mythology behind Krueger with a back story pertaining to his mother (a nun) and his birth (she was raped by hundreds of mental patients). Sadly, some of the supporting characters are downright embarrassing. The two biggest offenders are dreamworld switchblade toting, mowhawked Taryn (""In my dreams I'm beautiful. And bad "") and D&D geek turned dream wizard Will. I don't think Craven ever envisioned his monster being zapped by laser beams emanating from the finger tips of a boy dressed in a wizard's cloak.Regardless of the sometimes shameful characters, the teens are played by a rather strong troupe. There isn't a bad actor in the bunch. Patricia Arquette is very good as heroine Kristen, Ken Sagoes provides comic relief with his curse laden outbursts and Rodney Eastman emotes well as the mute Joey. Bradley Gregg, one of the best of the young actors, is sadly dispensed too early in the film (in the puppet scene, the film's murder highlight). On the adult side there is strong support from Priscilla Pointer, John Saxon, Craig Wasson and Larry Fishburne (a dead ringer for Laurence Fishburne **wink**). Wasson as Dr. Neil Gordon is really believable especially given that he spends most of his time talking to the ghost of a dead nun. John Saxon does a super turn as the now drunk Mr. Thompson. The finale featuring Saxon and Wasson finding (and battling!) Freddy's skeleton is perhaps the film's strongest scene. Returning Heather Langenkamp is still a bit stilted in her delivery but it is good to see her return from the franchise.Director Chuck Russell made his feature film debut with this sequel. He did a great job with some of the dream sequences, effectively creating visuals that have a dream like quality (Dali-esque melting tricycles, murderous tongues & puppets, large human swallowing snakes). Unfortunately a majority of the dreams are lit in a way that screams 1980s rock video with solid beams of light bursting through conveniently cracked walls. He also fails to maintain an even tone as the films jumps from horror to camp comedy without warning. Following this Russell went on to helm a much more consistent film with the remake of THE BLOB (he has since moved onto budgets big enough to allow him to go by Charles).One element where the ELM STREET films really shine is the effects work and this film is no exception. Featuring work from the teams of Kevin Yagher, Greg Cannom and Mark Shostrum, the effects range from the surreal to the gory and all are executed well. There is even an excellent bit of stop motion animation involving a puppet that becomes Freddy. With a budget of roughly $5 million dollars, the effects teams pulled off a lot of great big screen moments.Sadly, this films contrasting tone reflects where the ELM STREET series was heading. The first forty minutes maintain the mystique of Freddy Krueger being a menacing boogeyman. Then we arrive at ""Welcome to prime time bitch "" It is a seemingly harmless punch line that symbolizes the point at which Freddy Krueger went from repulsive child killer to witty serial killer. After this point, all of the dark menace that Krueger displayed in the earlier film's is abandoned in favor of audience pleasing one liners. Krueger had jumped the shark as they say. Renny Harlin, who described Freddy as ""horror's James Bond,"" worked under even less demanding dramatic restraints in 1988 and turned Krueger into a full time comedy star with the fourth entry THE DREAM MASTER. Distributor New Line Cinema couldn't be happier as it was the highest grosser of the series (before FREDDY VS. JASON).",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

Best of the ""Elm Street"" sequels suffers from mostly unremarkable characterizations/performances and underdevelopment of its clever premise, but offers up some wonderfully vivid dream sequences and imaginative visual effects and makeup work. Englund gets a few one-liners, but he's still refreshingly monstrous here (the hammy wiseacre days were on their way, though). The story and screenplay were co-written by Wes Craven; it's a shame he didn't return to directing duties as well--Russell does a workmanlike job, but Craven's skillful vision might have knocked this one up a few notches.55/100",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

Containing some very imaginative death scenes, utilising some dated, yet cool effects; this movie restored my faith in horror sequels (breifly).Some good new characters, who learn to control their dreams are still no match for Freddy, except maybe one, Kristen Parker (Patricia Arquette), who has the power to pull others into her dreams, and fight Freddy with them at her side.Too bad that the death of Nancy (Nice Shock That) signalled the downfall of the series after this one.

Also, the audience is given a bit more backstory, to add to Freddy's mythology (""the bastard son of a hundred maniacs!""), which is always cool, for a franchise geek like me - I love extraneous detail!It's kind of an early forerunner to the superhero genre, since all of the kids are given special powers, whilst in the dream-state... It's still not great, but, if you discount the original, then it's definitely the best in the series; which probably has something to do with the fact that, aside from the original, it's the only other one that Wes Craven wrote!

Especially Taryn played by the amazing Jennifer Rubin (Bad Dreams). In this chapter Krueger targets the last of the Elm st. Children who have gone crazy and been put into a mental institution. Even though it was only released three years after the first Nancy is supposed to be like ten years older and a grad school therapist. A young Laurence Fishburne (Matrix) also stars. This is the entry where Freddy really became a pop villain. He's still dark but he has just a bit more humor. The kills are fantastical and involved.

86,baumer,Continues the downward spiral,5,21 January 2002,"May contain spoilers:I think sometimes, if you read enough of these reviews you may think that I sound like a record that skips all of the time.  You can probably sum up my like and dislike of horror films in the most rudimentary ways of analysis. Early horror movies good, latter horror movies bad.  And on the whole that is probably true, although there are exceptions to the rule ( Scream 1996, Blair Witch 1999, Sixth Sense 1999).  But films like Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween and Nightmare On Elm Street are paradigms of what all horror should be.  They are the quintessential "" boogyman under the bed "" stories that we were all afraid of as kids.  Like Kevin Spacey says in The Usual Suspects, ""spook stories that you use to scare your kids....tell on your dad and Keyser Soze will come and get you.""  Well that is what me and my friends dreamed about when we were kids.  If you did something wrong, it's not God ( or Keyser Soze) that will punish you, it's Jason, Michael, Leatherface or Freddy.  And Freddy was just a little more intransigent than some of the others.  It's not that Jason and the rest were pushovers but at least with them, you had a chance when you were on common ground.  But how do you beat a dream?  How do you destroy what is in your mind?  And the answer is that you can't.  Wes Craven created a monster that was born from events written about in the L.A. Times and he put his own spin on it.  According to Craven, the L.A. Times printed three non followed up articles about Korean or Asian boys dying in their sleep.  Many of these boys had complained to their parents that something in their dreams was haunting them and they begged for help, to no avail.  So in some strange way, Nightmare On Elm Street has some truth to it.  Doesn't that make it all the more surreal?  I begin the review with this long-winded tirade because this is what made A Nightmare On Elm Street the film that it was.  Nightmare 1 not only makes my list as one of the best horror films ever made but one of the best films ever made period. To watch a film which intrigues you that much is a treat.  It is films like this that create movie lovers.  1978, 1980, 1975 and 1984 were important years in my life because that is when the genesis of horror films began for me(Halloween, Friday the 13th, Jaws and Nightmare On Elm Street were the films released those years).Unfortunately, equally as frustrating as Nightmare One was dazzling is the fact that the rest of the series does not comply one iota to what the original started.  I am not quite sure how Robert Shaye slandered  this franchise to the point of it becoming nothing more than a circus act, but in his defence, this so-called circus that I so sanctimoniously refer to it as, has generated over a quarter of a billion dollars in grosses and propelled New Line from a small one roomed building into one of the giants of Hollywood.  Look no further than the studio behind Lord of the Rings.  Who is responsible for it's success?  New Line.  And who runs New Line? Bob Shaye.  And who made Bob Shaye famous?  Freddy Krueger.However, success comes with a price and the Nightmare Series is no exception.  Nightmare One was the pinnacle of greatness.  Nightmare Two is an abomination and Nightmare Three isn't much better.  Let's see if we can begin there.What is good about Dream Warriors is that it furthers the legend of Freddy Krueger.  We find out here that Freddy was fathered by 100 different maniacs who raped Amanda Krueger, his mother, while she was locked mistakenly in the psychiatric ward with the nuts over a weekend.  Being a nun, she was forced to have the baby and hence we have this monster that was born, "" the bastard son of 100 maniacs. ""Wes Craven wrote the script and there are scenes of brilliance that tease the Nightmare on Elm Street purists.  The acting in here is quite good as well with famous names like Laurence Fishburn and Patricia Arquette.  But what ultimately stains this movie is the fact that it is just not scary. Not only is it not scary, it is not really that intriguing.  And to top it off, it continues the theme of not abiding to the rules that Wes set up in the first film.  Here Freddy can still get you while you are awake, he can still hurt you in different forms and he can metamorphisise into things that can get you in ways that he is supposed to be forbidden from doing.  And that is what disappointed me with this film and with the later films to come out of this series.  Also, if you are going to have different writers for each film, shouldn't they know about the other films that came before them? This is what makes the Nightmare series a sloppy one.Nightmare On Elm Street 3, Dream Warriors is not the worst of the series ( that in my opinion has to go to number 2 ) but it is certainly not far from that lofty honor.  But to be fair, many of the people that I know that like the series say that this is one of the best out of the seven that exist. I disagree and my reason is that if you like horror and not comedy, then you will look on any of the films after the first and before Wes' last, as being blasphemy.5 out of 10-- It rates a five simply because Craven and Frank Darabont ( of Shawshank fame ) have attempted to write some clever and eerie dialogue and plot twists.  Their presence gives it a passing grade....but nothing more.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
87,DunnDeeDaGreat,The second best in the series,10,19 November 2001,The Dream Warriors is one of my favorite in the series because Freedy finally met his match in these kids. Freddy's biggest nemesiss Nancy also returned to give him his just desserts which was cool. The film also has a great nude scene which is always cool.,A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
88,mentalcritic,"The good, the bad, and the just plain silly...",5,21 September 2004,"While there has never really been a rivalry or competition between the Friday The 13th and Nightmare On Elm Street series, sometimes one cannot help but compare the two, just from a presentation point of view. What separated the Nightmare franchise, essentially an ability to go in a more fantastic direction, also quickly became its literal Achilles Heel. In 1987, however, B-level horror films were all the rage, and the budget used to realize the incredibly silly concept was enough to make it work.One of Freddy's many advantages over Jason was that he was able to speak, and therefore more interactive. This advantage served him well in the previous two films, but this was sort of the beginning of the comic Freddy that couldn't kill something without making a quip. Thankfully, the more adult tone of the rest of the film keeps this comic side in check. The quips here are more appropriate to the character.The story, where do I begin with the story? The story has a literal epidemic of teens killing themselves after sleep, with the survivors having been moved into a psychiatric facility. Given the populace of the average American town, that must be one big psychiatric facility. To the film's credit, the procedures and routines of the facility are fairly realistically scripted. The group discussions and refusal to explore anything the patient might tell the staff are still staples of psychiatry today, in fact.The problem comes when the fantasy, super-hero element is brought into the story. Giving each character something extraordinary they can do in their dreams is one thing, but the whole soul-collection thing was just plain silly. A nice effect, for certain, but I don't think it was particularly horrifying to anyone above the age of ten. A lot of the film is like this, however: the makers seem to expect the viewer to be impressed with the childish. One has to wonder if the screenwriters had to get copyright clearance from the makers of Dungeons & Dragons, in fact.Freddy's kills or shock moments here are certainly at a creative peak. It's also worth catching the film to see Patricia Arquette in a rather early role that I'm sure she pays her agent to not mention. Although the quality of the rest of the production makes one wonder, I guess every horror franchise has to have alumni who get work on a decent film, although the FT13 franchise has the Nightmare franchise beat simply because it has Kevin Bacon in episode one.While none of the Nightmare films could really be called great, this is certainly the last that could be called good. The next three episodes were an agnoising exercise in trying to make horror ""suitable for all ages"". I gave this episode a five out of ten for at least being somewhat inventive.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
89,mattymatt4ever,Superior sequel,8,3 March 2003,"I liked this movie better than the original and its predecessor.  It's a very nifty, crafty premise and the plot is just as good as the nightmares. Both the plot and well-developed characters kept me deeply engaged, and I like how Heather's character is written as a psychologist (the pupil has now become the teacher!).  The gore is not as bloody as it is in the past two films, and though the special f/x are great, it's not just the f/x I was impressed with.  The performances are good.  John Saxon makes a few appearances towards the end.  Patricia Arquette is great in her first major role.  And Laurence Fishburne is great as the likable orderly.  There's even a nice little nude scene/wet dream sequence to boot.  How many of us guys fantasize about doing the nasty with a hot-looking nurse?  Freddy's wisecracking sense of humor develops throughout the film.  Overall, this is a very fun experience and I consider it to be one of the best in the series! My score:  8 (out of 10)",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
90,Fernando-Rodrigues,The Dream Warriors,6,9 February 2021,"It has an interesting concept, that could've worked better if they hadn't made some choices (like adding more fantasy to the story, making Freddy turn to a sarcastic killer, and not keeping the mystery of not knowing when it's really a nightmare, etc...)",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

Nancy, the first film's survivor, comes to their aid and helps them to unite in their fight against the finger-gloved burn victim.Miles ahead of Part 2, but not quite as effective as the original. This film in most parts mixes well state of the art special effects and some suspense. The visualization of the Freddy dreams are at times truly spectacular, but the lack of any real chills makes this one mostly a nice try but no cigar. The performances are mostly lacking, and it's pretty badly written at times. John Saxon makes a very welcome return (a little to brief though) and Laurence Fishburne is solid in a small role. A story concerning Freddy's origin here gives the film added weight and makes for a satisfying conclusion.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
92,CursedChico,This time better,7,21 March 2021,"This time betterSecond movie was not so good. This movies is good but not like first one.This time Freedy seems appearing only in dreams but he came to save his bones in real and at first of the movies, he tried to kill after she woke up as i remember, other than those, freddy was all in dreams just like first movie. And in the hospital, wrote joey's body ""come and get me"".So nancy came back. As an intern. We all thought she was dead. Wow. It was nice to see her. She was a hero. Saved some of the kids. Maybe they will save other kids in future. Also her father died probably. I could not see there. And his father, he was alcoholic. Probably trying to forget everything.We saw Old, huge computers. 30 years before. It is a different time.Also it was good to see Laurence Fishburne. So young.Kristen seemed so familiar and at last i remembered. From tv series, medium. Same voice that relaxing and cool and same looking. She looks same :)So lots of kids in hospital. The lucky ones who freddy could not kill. But yet. Because they said in somewhere, lots of kids committed suicides. It means freddy killed but not the ones in hospital. Which had some powers in dreams.Jennifer was not sleeping for example, i dont think so. He killed while awake with dark humor. Put into TV. So again he can come to real life ias we see.There was an interesting topic also. Child abusement. But child abusement is not fault of child. Freddy tried to kill joey.Now, we learned about his mother. How bad people did bad things to his mother and maybe he was revenging this. If he knows of course the things done to his mother.Somehow while they were together, kruger separated the kids before last fight. Fingers with needles were cool. Did she die? Then Only three left but they won at last.He could always change his appearance to fake them but i think he does not like it.And jesus saved by destroying the bones :) It was interesting.In the end we waited again something absurd, to come back for example but not this time which we saw in the previous movies. There are more movies in this series so he will come back :) like candy man.I like this movie. I hope other movies of the series are like this.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
93,fmarkland32,Dream slayers...,7,1 August 2006,"Heather Langenkamp returns to the series (After not being in # 2) to help a group of elm street teenagers face off against Freddy Krueger once and for all. But how do you kill something that is already dead ?(Well you can't, being that it was very profitable) Nightmare On Elm Street 3:Dream Warriors in many ways is the best of the series, it is the most fun of the series although it's not quite as suspenseful as the first movie. Of course the best thing about this particular sequel which of course never got expanded on was the fact that the teenagers fight back and the most interesting moments are of the teenagers facing their weaknesses, such as drug addiction, being in a wheel chair and having no voice. Freddy Krueger of course takes on a more mythological figure, in which he represents mainly depression, addiction and anything that will get you to kill yourself. In this light this sequel takes on an interesting light. Plus it was nice to see John Saxon again.* * * out of 4-(Good)",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
94,ivo-cobra8,The best Nightmare on Elm Street film ever made! Dream Warriors is awesome!,10,1 November 2015,"A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987) is definitely the best sequel horror slasher film in the series franchise! It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 is my second favorite best film in the franchise that I just love this film to death! I love A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), this one A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987) and New Nightmare (1994) to death! This one is the first best favorite film of mine and I just love everything they did in this film. My awesome favorite heroine Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) is back and better than ever! She is a bad ass! I love everything about this film everything and I love it to death!:P ""Welcome to Prime time, Bitch!""This was a MAJOR improvement over the disaster part 2, The Gore FX were excellent and the story was well written. It's too bad Nancy was killed off it would have been nice to see her in future sequels. I love this horror slasher film to death it is very imaginative, entertaining, a good set of characters, some fun catchphrases/dialogue, a great Dokken song aka Dream Warriors...a lot of awesome stuff is in this one. Why I love this film? Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) returns which you already know I love the main heroine so much in the series franchise. John Saxon also returns as Det. Donald Thompson. Wes Craven is back as writer in this film, the movie is a little longer than the first and the second film. This is Patricia Arquette's first movie. In my opinion it is her first best movie alongside with Stigmata (1999) in other films she made were just awful or some sucked! Anyway I love Patricia Arquette here: She's beautiful, vibrant and has so much emotion in her lovely eyes. A really essential female lead for a film this big. This is how you correctly make a sequel. This one really felt like ""Part 2"" to me because of the continuation from the 1st movie. The hospital setting fit the theme perfectly and this one contains one of my favorite death scenes in the whole series. Also, 80's band Dokken recorded a few songs for the movie which is another reason why this is a must-see for Nightmare fans.Chuck Russell is one of my favorite directors he directed The Mask (1994) with Jim Carrey that I love, Eraser with Arnold Schwarzenegger and The Blob (1988) a year later which I also love so much. I think he made great choose of casting the actors alongside with Wes Craven the idea and imaginative of the film flick were just really awesome, how they scramble in to making a movie! Robert England is pure gold in this film, seriously I just love his imaginative and portrayal of Freddy Krueger in this film! The man is the main legend as the villain in the series!, It has a cool premise and I really enjoy The characters. To me this is the 1st best horror sequel ever made after A Nightmare on Elm Street which is the second favorite one in the franchise. I Love this film so much.I only have one major problem with the film and that is Nancy dies on the end of the film here. Even tough she dies, the death scene was awesome because it was honorable death! She stopped Freddy for hurting anyone else and Kristen Parker. The death scene was honorable to me because Kristen ( Patricia Arquette) was crying over her death and just love how Kristen showed how of a heart she has and that she is a good wonderful person and a human been. Wes Craven did not wanted to kill Nancy off. He did not like the idea that they killed her off! Jason Saxon as Donald Thompson is also killed by the end of the film which that shouldn't be in here also! The idea for local psychiatric hospital for teens in this film was just very brilliant and very imaginative praise to Wes Craven. A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) who invades the minds of a new group of teens -- and the nightmares begin again. Local teenagers start dying and only Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) knows the truth. Now a doctor at the local psychiatric hospital, she is the lone survivor of one of Freddy's previous killing sprees. Now, it's a fight against her co-workers' disbelief and a race against time to stop Freddy before he kills again. That's your basic plot. It does involve travel and invading in to the minds of a teen's dreams. 10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
95,juliankennedy23,Dream Warriors come out and play.,7,22 October 2006,"A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors: 7 out of 10: Eighties nostalgia was in full bloom as I recently watched this third installment of the Freddy Krueger series. Freddy was always a more creative and witty horror icon and Dream Warriors is when he really began to shine. (He is certainly more fun than the grungy, torturing serial killers in today's movies)The dream sequences are fresh and creative and the kids fight back in fun ways. The two standout scenes are the deaf mute who is tongue tied and the sleepwalker who gets a little help from Freddie pulling his strings. (I also have a soft spot for the Harry Potter death scene) The movie reunites some of the original films cast and while Heather Lagenkamp really isn't that good an actress, B movie regular John Saxon who plays her father gives a solid performance.As for new cast members before they were famous stars Patricia Arquette and Lawrence Fishburne handle themselves well. Other cast members (except for Robert England's excellent portrayal of Freddie of course) are passable the only exception being the milquetoast zero charisma performance of Craig Wasson as Lagenkamp's love interest who seems to drag the movie down in every scene.The special effects are excellent (Yes Snake Freddie and the skeleton were a bit off but for 1987 they still outshine many large budget movies of today.) The hair, diet coke cans and music is pure eighties (Dokken? What were they thinking?) I think as a result the film has actually gotten better over time. Never boring, often creative and defiantly fun Dream Warriors (Yes that is a dumb title) is a surprisingly good time at the movies.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
96,fernandoschiavi,"Part 3 has a terrifying atmosphere, in a bizarre and creative setting, just like the deaths, and it doesn't owe anything to Wes Craven first film (the best in the franchise)",6,19 September 2021,"Even with Freddy's Revenge's mediocre reception, its massive revenue immediately warranted the production of a new chapter of Nightmare Hour. But this time, New Line producers waited longer to start the project and got back the support of Wes Craven, who returned to help script what would become the series' best film after the original: The Warriors of the Dreams. In the hands of the then debuting director Chuck Russell (The Bubble, The Mask, among others), this third part is one of the best films in the franchise, establishing connections with the first, and creating some situations that would mark the rest of the series.In the plot we see Kristie (Patricia Arquete) struggling not to sleep, when her mother arrives and orders the girl to lie down - in her dream, there is the traditional ""lullaby"" song sung by children. Kristen follows one of them to a house, where, in a bizarre setting, she finds children's bodies hanging, and is chased by Freddy. Upon awakening, with her wrists cut off, she is taken by her mother to a mental hospital, where other young people are also tormented by Freddy. Enter Nancy (Heather Langenkamp), who survived Freddy's attacks in the first film; she returns here as a dream researcher, and is able to help the medical team understand the nightmares of young people, diagnosed until then, with a kind of mass hysteria. With the help of physician Dr. Neil (Craig Wasson), Nancy begins her mission to help young people face their nightmares. Coincidentally after her arrival, the first deaths begin to occur, which generate distrust of the hospital board, and young Joey is kept trapped in his dream by Freddy, which leaves him in a coma. Also for prescribing the drug Hypnocil (a dream inhibitor) to young people, Nancy and Dr Neil are released from the hospital and try, in some way, to help the young people, who are at the mercy of Dr. Elizabeth, who only thinks of sedating. Them.After the disappointing homoerotic fantasy in Freddy's Revenge, Dream Warriors finally understands Freddy Krueger's vast potential and the right way to exploit his abilities. By playing more with the lucidity of the dream world, the film strongly embraces fantasy and replaces the scares with an elegant amount of gore and special effects. Sure, a fantasy, but a highly dark fantasy. This is where Freddy starts to get more imaginative, yielding memorable sequences like the one where he transforms into a giant snake, his sudden appearance from inside a television (""Welcome to prime time, bitch!"") and, of course, the most elaborate The franchise's death scene - and probably one of the best in cinema, probably - when the killer emerges as a great ventriloquist and turns poor Phillip (Bradley Gregg) into a human puppet with his veins and guts. The fact that the series has never been nominated for an Oscar for its makeup effects is really scary.The psychiatric institution, where much of the film is set with its characters, was a happy choice by director Chuck Russell, where the place creates dozens of possibilities for teenagers' nightmares, like the impressive scene where Kristen slits her wrists, or to which Nancy is swallowed by an armchair. In this volume, Freddy also transforms into a giant snake. And it's the third movie in a row that uses snakes to scare; Freddy is almost a Lord Voldemort. The religious allusions are strengthened in this volume: Freddy opens a hole that clearly leads to hell, one of the most striking characters in the production is a nun. Another interesting death is that of Taryn, who confronts Freddy with his knifes, but soon, he presents in his hands several syringes, killing the girl with an overdose, and of course, making his sarcastic jokes. Also highlighted is the scene where young Joey (Rodney Eastman), leaves the group, and goes after the hot nurse, who, after seducing the young man, getting naked in front of him, holds him in bed, tying him with tongues (that's right!).Dream Warriors also benefit from a key element: Nancy shares her own experiences with Krueger with the institute's patients and, after years of studying the psychology of dreams, begins to teach them how to fight back. The element of lucid dreaming enters, that is, when we are dreaming and we are aware that everything is in fact a dream; so if this is just in my mind, i can manipulate everything to my liking, no? This is the logic of the script for the group of unbalanced young people to fight Krueger, and it's exciting. We have a duel of knives and syringes, somersaults on the wall and even a boy turning into a wizard, with Krueger manipulating his fears in a grandiose way; the syringe glove and the deadly mechanical wheelchair are some notable examples. The production also features Patricia Arquette, who plays Kristen, a girl with a special gift for pulling people into her dreams, which yields some sequels.Dream Warriors also benefit from a key element: Nancy shares her own experiences with Krueger with the institute's patients and, after years of studying the psychology of dreams, begins to teach them how to fight back.

It's interesting because of the mystery created around the nun played by Nan Martin (whose apparition can be as sinister as Krueger himself), but it results in a rather...unusual climax, even for a film about dreams. Was Freddy really some kind of demon? This theory gains even more support when Freddy reveals that he absorbs the children's souls, which strengthen him. We also learned something about Freddy's past: he is the product of a maniac's rape of a nurse in a sanatorium, which tells us that the source of his psychopathy is probably genetic. This information does not explain, however, some of his supernatural powers. The idea of Krueger's skeleton reappearing and having a duel with police officers is bizarre, but it guarantees stop motion effects that would make Ray Harryhausen very proud. And even though the boiler room is the most important environment in mythology, it is already becoming repetitive that all confrontations with the character end there; even though director of photography Roy H. Wagner bets on a stronger red coloration, turning the place into something even more hellish than Craven's vision in the original.Robert Englund, who played the villain, is once again flawless. His participation is greater within this plot, where this time, he will have to face the teenagers in their dreams. Everyone takes on a special element, such as increased strength, spell powers, or simply being lighter and more flexible. For the first time the killer faces big problems, both in dreams, fighting teenagers, both in the real world, with Neil and Nancy's father, who set out in search of Freddy's remains, to put a definitive end to the evil plans of the assassin.The effects grew in quantity and quality, with all the makeup and special effects being done in a creative and well-done way. The nightmares are more terrifying and fun, mixing elements that made it successful within the series, further increasing the field of exploration between dreams and the real world. However, we are left with the impression that, once again, the series' internal logic is sacrificed to create ""cool"" scenes that appeal to its young target audience. Even with many scenes that generate unanswered questions, this is a good chapter that deserves to be seen, especially by fans of the first one.A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 has a terrifying atmosphere, in a bizarre and creative setting, just like the deaths, and it doesn't owe anything to Wes's first film (the best in the franchise). Merits for the director, who, despite all the impositions of the production, managed to do an excellent job. This third episode of the franchise is a real gift to Freddy Krueger fans, and probably the most important movie in the entire franchise.

Freddy morphs into a much more one liner oriented, although the second nightmare did feature the ""You've got the body,(rips flesh of brain) I've got the brain!"" scene. The vague superhero aspect helps this movie stick out, but character and plot are a little lacking. I love the cheesy ""Bastard son of a thousand maniacs"" monologue.

It still scared the hell out of me but for the first time also let me see that Freddy could get beaten as the team of heroes found a way to control their dreams and be stronger.This was important for a ten year old, especially as I was having dreams of Freddy myself and needed to find a way to beat him!Thankfully, I did - and Dream Warriors became a film I would watch over and over, and still love to this day!",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
101,acidburn-10,The best sequel,10,26 June 2015,"This was actually the first Freddy film I saw, as a child discovering these gems for the first time was a real treat and also discovering Jason and Michael Myers. But to this day The Nightmare on Elm Street series always had the better quality that helped them rise above the usual low budget fare. And seeing this one first, I can honestly say that I started with the best.I'm always torn between this and the first one, but honestly I think I love this one more. After the' what's considered a disappointing part 2 (honestly I thought was decent), part 3 brought things back on the right track. Firstly bringing back the imagination was a good move and focused on the creepy, but fun aspect of the dream sequences (something the sequel did lack). This also brought something new and fresh to the Freddy story, by introducing his mother, which was an interesting back-story and doesn't feel completely made up at the last minute, you can see that a lot of thought went into it, which was great. Another great addition to the plot was that the characters can pull each other into their own dreams, which was again very interesting. Another thing that was awesome was the special effects, which still look fantastic to this day, especially the Freddy snake which was very cool and unsettling at the same time and the Freddy puppet which was also cool, and none of that CGI crap was used either, back in the good old days of practical effects, which always remain the best.Even the plot was very decent and interesting, this just had a much better story and the fact that it was co-written by Wes Craven himself, was just an added bonus. This one has a group of teens who are the last of the Elm street children, rounded up in Weston Hills sanatorium and are all being stalked in their dreams by Freddy himself. Also bringing back the best heroine in the series Nancy was another nice touch, she's older and wiser this time, playing a doctor who studies dreams and tries to help the kids fight Freddy, by discovering that they each have special powers in their dreams.Another thing that this movie got right was the casting and characters; each of them gets their fair share amount of screen time and is all relatable. Heather Langenkamp coming back older and wiser is like I said a brilliant move, and she brings depth and warmth to such a brilliant character and feels an intriguing part of the story. Patricia Arquette also truly shines as the new lead Kristen she proves a definite match for Freddy, while still maintain innocence and charm. Craig Wasson does well as the doctor and does work up great chemistry with Nancy. Ken Sagoes plays another interesting addition Kincaid, with each of his emotions feeling true and never forced. Rodney Easton also does great as the silent Joey, his expressions and emotions do more than what words can, he really shines in his role. Jennifer Rubin is probably one of the most memorable characters in the entire series, she was just brilliant as Taryn, and also just loved her punk look. Even the first 2 victims Phillip and Jen were interesting and sympathetic and were definitely sad to see them go so early. Another sparkling move was bringing back the ever amazing John Saxon, whose just great as always and even pre fame Laurence Fishburne was also cool to see. Then finally Robert England himself was just as brilliant as ever, and hasn't quite turned into the wisecracking clown yet as this point, but even then he still steals the show.So all in all this sequel takes full advantage of its surroundings and is executed perfectly, showing that everything from the cast, the story and the effects, everything was done at the correct balance and truly stands out as one of the best all-time slasher movies.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
102,Darkside-Reviewer,"Nine, Ten Freddy's back again",9,9 April 2019,A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors is the best of the Nightmare franchise and arguably the best Freddy film of them all and made Freddy truly a household name there's a reason why it's so highly rated by fans by 1987 there had been so many Slasher movies released that they all started to blend together and become predictable and many thought this movie would be the same but the film is very innovative for its time the kills in the movie are very memorable and the practical effects are very well done and the one liners from Freddy aswell as more backstory on Freddy really give his character more depth and make you laugh.I personally have seen more horror and Slasher movies than most and a lot of them are very similar in plot and the ways people are killed in the movies but Nightmare 3s kill scenes are one of a kind even today and most of them have never been copied by other movies making them memorable and one of a kind just like this movie.If your a fan of Freddy or just Horror and Slasher movies in general I highly recommend you watch the movie on Blu Ray and enjoy it at its best you won't regret watching it.,A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

105,TalesfromTheCryptfan,The most satisfying sequel of the franchise!,10,7 January 2009,"Six Years has passed since the events of the first movie, a beautiful blonde girl named Kirsten (Patrica Arquette) had a nightmare involving Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) which almost leads her to suicide as she ends up in a psychiatric ward with the other kids of Elm Street named Joey (Rodney Eastman), Taryn (Jennifer Rubin), Philip (Bradley Gregg), Jennifer (Penelope Sudrow), Will (Ira Heiden) and Kincaid (Ken Sagoes). However Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) who survived the original massacre now works as a psychiatrist who helps with patients who have dream problems and she's joined by Dr. Neil Goldman (Craig Wasson). However some of the patients seem to dream about Freddy as some of them get killed one by one, only Nancy has the answers as she wants some of those patients to join with her to battle against this evil cretin once and for all.The best sequel of the series! after the very disappointing and yet homoerotic ""Freddy's Revenge"", New Line Cinema decided to hire Wes Craven back as he co-write a script with future ""Shawshank Redemption"" and ""Green Mile"" director Frank Darabont to ignore the events of part 2 and continue off the first one. Chuck Russell makes his debut for this one as it lead him to make ""The Blob"" in 1988 and ""The Mask"" in 1994, this installment delivers all the goods that a fanboy and fangirl can enjoy. The film co-stars Laurence Fishburne and John Saxton with appearances by Dick Cavett and Zsa Zsa Gabor, this horror fantasy thriller has good scares and some gory violence abound. The special effects even for it's day are just incredible like the Freddy Snake critter and the acting is superb, this movie made Freddy more popular thanks to witty one-liners and a dark sense of humor. Greg Cannom and Kevin Yagher did a nice job on the make-up and gore effects for this production, the film also gives us a nice look into the mythology of ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" with some nice twists and turns even by the ending.This is one sequel that still holds up and rocks! i highly recommend it.P.S.: The ""Dream Warriors"" rock song by Dokken rules!",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
106,LoneWolfAndCub,Not Too Bad At All,7,3 September 2005,"A Nightmare On Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors isn't a bad sequel at all. After the atrocious Freddy's Revenge I didn't think this would be too good. I was wrong. Heather Langenkamp returns as Nancy Thompson and Patricia Arquette and Laurence Fishburne are some well known actors.This one follows Craven's a little more by returning to the original story. The last teenagers on Elm Street are now in a psychiatric hospital because everyone thinks their insane. The parents think their trying to commit suicide but they are actually having nightmares of Freddy Krueger. No one believes them but Nancy, the original survivor.This is a well done sequel. The acting is quite good for this horror movie, the dialogue interesting and the directing pretty good.The effects were a bit shoddy and the ending was a little cheesy with the skeleton fight but apart from that it was a pretty good sequel. Quite rare these days. 3/5.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
107,statuskuo,One Dreamt Over The Cuckoo's Nest,5,8 July 2021,"I once asked a friend how movies like the ones in the ""Nightmare On Elm Street""s yield such incredible talent such as Wes Craven, Frank Darabont, Chuck Russell, Jack Sholder, Renny Harlin, and so forth, whilst ""Friday The 13th"" series have...MAYBE Sean S. Cunningham.His answer was actually fairly insightful...because they can delve into surreal cinema.So, having ignored Part 2, we pick up at an insane asylum holding children who are a danger to themselves and others. By ""children"", I mean teens. They are suicidal and can't seem to find rest in their dreams. Easy pickings for Fred Kreuger.At the asylum is Nancy Thompson. Remember her from the first one? Yeah, her acting actually got worse (if that were possible). Played once again by Heather Langenkamp.Well, look...this could easily be rebooted in 2021 as a X-Men crossover with Nightmare movies. And still be fairly interesting (good going writer, Frank Darabont). But I'm not sure the comic series wants to be associated with this level of violence.Now...I'm trying to recall why I watched this so much as a teen (seventh grade at the time). I actually went over to a friends house back in middle school and watched it on Cinemax (colloquially known as Skin-O-Max) and there were the most luscious melons even to today's standards...Stacy Alden. Well built.But that was what we did back then. I think this entire movie is now grossly outdated. A few good moments in terms of atmosphere, but for the most part...VERY poor acting. I would assume some of them would've gotten really into their roles. Again, trying to remember if in 1987 people were really serious about acting. It seems to be a legit profession today. Though, look...late 80's cinema was all about acting that sounded straight from the script pages (""Mannequin"" came out this year as well...a very understated James Spader role).Here is also a very wasted John Saxon role, which seemed as if he was there just to collect a paycheck.Okay, not a COMPLETE disaster, due to nostalgia, but still...doesn't really hold up as I recall it being...a little more fun.I DO like that they add a little bit more lore to Freddy's background. Here, it's the history of his Mother. And that, I would say, is why this one stands out.Patricia Arquette is horrible too. But it's her first role so, cut her some slack.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
108,Nightman85,"Hands-down, the best Elm Street sequel!!",10,21 January 2006,"Outstanding third entry in the Elm Street movies is definitely the best of the sequels and well lives up to the excitement of the original film.Nancy is now a psychiatrist who must help some troubled youths that are in danger of being sliced by murderous Freddy!It's not surprising that this sequel was written by 'Elm Street creator Wes Craven, who chose to leave the directing to Chuck Russell for this movie. Nightmare on Elm Street 3 is a fasted-paced, cleverly written horror fantasy that's the most entertaining of the Elm Street follow-ups. The movie plays out as a gripping thrill ride that's both chilling and darkly funny. There's a number of smart twists thrown in as well. 'Elm Street 3 also has the most dazzling and impressive special FX of the series, as well as some of the greatest nightmare and murder sequences. The marionette sequence with Bradly Gregg is a big favorite. The direction of Chuck Russell is slick indeed, delivering plenty of atmospheric darkness and energetic action. Even the maze-like sets are impressive. Charles Bernstein's Elm Street theme music is used once more. In addition there's also an awesome title rock anthem by the group Dokken.Another high point in the film is the cast. Heather Langenkamp reprises her role well, as does John Saxon who appears once again as Langenkamp's father. Craig Wasson is a good hero as a doctor attempting to help the teenagers. Patricia Arquette, Ken Sagoes, Jennifer Rubin, Bradly Gregg, and Rodney Eastman all make for solid teenage characters. Of course Robert Englund is back as Freddy, who has a bit more of a cheeky sense of humor this time around.One couldn't ask for a better Elm Street sequel than this one. It's a fun ride all the way for fans and is one of the best horror-fantasy films out there.

Today 34 years later still it is. Probably I've watched around 10 times this movie and I love it.Great Fx's, storyline and beautifully executed. I love all the warriors and their powers.

110,baileycrawly,The Return of Wes Craven,9,26 October 2019,"This is easily one of my two favorite entries in this series.
Wes Craven comes back after sitting out on part 2, Heather Langencamp and John Saxon return to reprise their roles from the original, and the series is finally setting itself up for the next couple of movies.
This is where things start to come together, where characters from the first film follow through to this one and we're given a group of kids, some of which we'll follow beyond this film. It's nice to have a more linear storyline and not another one-off movie.
This is the point where the series really stopped being a couple of good horror movies and really became a franchise, an expanded universe with a decent backstory and a cast of characters you can really root for and care about. This is the also where Freddy's personality really takes a noticeable shift from the boogeyman-in-the-shadows to the wisecracking, bitterly sarcastic antihero that he's perhaps best known for.
The story in this film is the strongest and most entertaining in the series up to this point, and it's all backed by a killer Dokken song that's just as timeless as the film itself.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

Told some more of the story but lacked anything exceptional.,A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
112,kirk-246,It wasn't enough,5,12 May 2009,"I think Freddy Krueger makes a good serial killer,and the since the 'Nightmare On Elm Street'movies have a fantasy element to it,they're actually pretty cool to watch,even though I haven't seen the fourth or fifth film yet.But this one doesn't have much energy to it.Some scenes of the movie are so ridiculous that you can't help but laugh.The movie starts out OK,but then it falls into the so-so area where you might think about watching a different movie.The director tries to give fans what they want,but instead he disappoints them.Robert Englund does a great job at playing Freddy Krueger,but even he can't save this movie.It's not that bad,but compared to other great horror films,this movie disappoints.I have to give credits to some of the special effects.Sorry,Freddy.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
113,emperor_bender,The gem of the series,8,19 February 2008,"A redeeming movie to the Nightmare series is right here. This is my favorite in the whole series. I loved the storyline, characters, kills, you name it. The characters were all very good as misplaced, slightly crazy teenagers. The adults weren't half bad either. Freddy was back to being GOOD in this movie. He had no unknown powers in this film that go unexplained. Heather Langenkamp returns as Nancy. Patricia Arquette starts her acting career with this movie. Laurence Fishburn and John Saxon show up as well, however with not enough camera time. The only things about this movie I didn't like too much were how quickly some characters were killed off and how everyone seemed to know they were dead and didn't even bother to check up on them. I give this an 8/10, good horror/Nightmare movie.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
114,Gafke,One of the better sequels,8,20 December 2005,"Kristen Parker is having nightmares and all of them are the same; a burned man in a dirty red and green sweater with razors on his fingers is trying to kill her. After emerging from one such nightmare with slashed wrists, Kristen's bitchy mother commits Kristen to a mental institution. There, Kristen meets several other teenagers who are all having the same nightmare she's been having. She also meets Nancy Thompson, a young psychiatrist who has her own history of troubled sleep. Nancy realizes that Freddy is back when Kristen pulls Nancy into one of her nightmares. Using Kristen's power, she and Nancy try to help the other kids develop their own dream powers so that they can battle Freddy and perhaps defeat him once and for all. This third installment in the Elm Street series is a huge improvement over the ghastly second film. The setting of a mental institution is claustrophobic and already quite scary enough even without Freddy's presence. The kids are all perfect simply because they're not perfect. The teens of recent movies are too often portrayed as flawlessly beautiful, taut bodied and fashion savvy with never a hair out of place. The kids in this film are real - awkward, pudgy, geeky, nerdy and totally believable. Watching them discover their powers and attempt to battle Freddy is a lot of fun. New subplots include dream suppressing medication and the icky story of Freddy's conception via one hundred maniacs and a most unfortunate young girl. A scene in a junkyard featuring a battle with Freddy's skeleton is really cool and very reminiscent of Ray Harryhausen's special effects.This is probably the best sequel to the original Nightmare On Elm Street, along with the fourth movie, The Dream Master. Skip the horrible 2nd film and go right on to this one.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

I also found that this was the most entertaining film because of some good dream sequences and the expansion of characters. This is the film which turns the dark scary Freddy into more of a comical figure although he is still very sinister. It was nice to see some familiar faces such as Langenkamp, Patricia Arquette and Laurence Fishburne. The movie also a questionable plot but its pulled out fairly nicely do to interesting dream scenes and dialogue between inmates at the sanitarium.

116,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,9,8 December 2004,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!Definitely the second best in the series, part 3 brings back Nancy, the heroine of the first movie, and happily disregards the events of the awful part 2.Featuring a good cast- Langenkamp, Saxon, Fishburne, Arquette, and a good script by Frank Darabont, Part 3 should not be seen as a rubbish sequel as it has many good points and few bad ones.Nancy has become a therapist/social worker for disturbed kids, and strangelyspecialises in traumas brought around by nightmares and fantasies. The film is situated mostly in a home for these kids, and Nancy becomes a group leader to try to discuss there problems. At first they do not trust her, but she reveals that, unlike the rest of the doctors, she believes that they are not experiences some kind of group psychosis, and that she too has experienced what they have. It becomes apparent that Freddy is back, and is stalking more kids. The key to stopping Kruger this time lies with the gifts each kid has, a skillonly they can bring into the dream world with them whether it be great strength or magic powers. However, the most powerful gift belongs to Alice, who can bring outsiders into her dreams, and therefore they can all fight Freddy together. Meanwhile, another Doctor along with Nancy's estranged father are looking for Kruger's bones to give them a proper burial.Yes the plot is wildly imaginative, but that is what made the original original. Again the kids are alone and misunderstood, but it is Nancy who teaches them to have confidence in their own strengths and not be afraid. The film has many excellent effects, the series beginning to show a reliance on gore, with several of the deaths being wonderfully gruesome and effective. There are a decent amount of scares, some good tension is built up, and unlike the other films, we grow to care about these characters and want to see who, if any, will survive. Englund once again steals the show, but the one liners are starting to make an appearance-the more we get to know the bad guy, the less scary he becomes, and soon we are rooting for him and forgetting that he is a child killing paedophile. But luckily this film doesn't go too far down that road. Overall a very good horror film, but with so many ideas it could have been longer with those ideas and characters explored more.8 out of 10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
117,theshadow908,One of the better sequels,6,21 June 2006,"A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (thankfully) ignores part 2 and picks up after the events of the first film. Nancy Thompson is now a psychiatrist at a hospital for disturbed children. She ends up discovering that all of the children in her care are not suicidal, but were attacked by Freddy Krueger because they are the last children of the lynch mob that killed him. Nancy ends up teaching the children that they can fight Freddy, because in your dreams you can do what you want. The children form a small army, calling themselves the Dream Warriors, and set out to take Freddy on. This isn't a perfect movie, but it is much better than the terrible part 2.Due to the return of characters Nancy Thompson and her cop father Donald, who is now an alcoholic after the events of the first film, this movie makes a return to what the first movie was all about. The mood and the creepiness return, and Robert Englund plays Freddy the way he's supposed to be played...As a wise cracking maniac. The movie is generally creepy throughout, but unfortunately toward the end it gets a bit silly. The children become kind of like superheroes in their dreams to fight Freddy, and it gets a bit goofy, especially when one of them becomes the Wizard Master and starts pulling some Dungeons and Dragons crap of Freddy. Another silly scene is when Lt. Thompson digs up Freddy's skeleton and it climbs out and starts fighting with him.The acting in this movie is pretty good. Heather Lengenkamp, John Saxon, and Robert Englund are just as good as in the first movie, and newcomer Patricia Arquette is very good. Also look for a young Laurence Fishburne as a hospital orderly.Overall, this is one of the more entertaining Nightmare films, and should be watched by fans of the series.6/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
118,bh_tafe3,One of the standout films of 1987,7,2 February 2009,"A lot of the people involved in the production of this film went on to be rather successful in later life. Chuck Russell made the 1994 hit The Mask, Frank Darabont, who did a lot of effects scenes in this, went on to direct the Shawshak Redemption and The Green Mile, arguably the two best and most loved Stephen King adaptations. Looking at this, it's not hard to see why. It's obvious from the get go that the people involved in this see it as much more than just a horror sequel. This does what a good sequel should, deepening the backstory in a sensible way and expanding the battle ground between the hero and villain.This also has possibly the best cast of any 80s horror movie with Craig Wasson, Patricia Arquette and Laurence Fishburne all signing up. Of course Wasson and Fishburne were no names back then and Patricia Arquette, like Johnny Depp in Part I was taking on her first movie role. We also have Heather Leagankamp and John Saxon returning and Wes Craven involved in the creative process. Basically this one had no excuses, and as it turned out, didn't need any.The story here is that Freddy Krueger is continuing with his quest to wipe out teenagers and is currently having fun forcing a group of them into a mental institute through recurring nightmares, but his fun is interrupted as he targets Kristen (an adequate performance from Arquette), a girl with the ability to bring others into her nightmares. When Kristen is sent to the mental institute with the other teenagers, Nancy Thompson (Leagenkamp, the hero of the original) and she comes up with a plan to combat Freddy in dreamland by getting Kristen to drag all of the teenagers into one of her nightmares, where they will use their special dream abilities to take down Freddy.We are given further insight into Freddy's origins, he was conceived by a nun who worked at a mental asylum. And Craig Wasson is left in the real world to give Nancy's father (John Saxon) a chance at redemption, and giving the special effects guys the chance to do some walking bone shenanigans.In case you can't tell, I loved this movie. It is a standout not only in the nightmare series, but in 80s horror. There is nudity and sexual references, but this is a good movie that has aged well. Worth watching whether for the first, or hundredth time.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

Many people say that the First was the Best, as usual the Original are preferred then the sequels. Perhaps because the first Freddy movie i saw at a young age was this movie. The First has many great scenes, the second was one the worst. The fourth and fifth were average. Freddy's Dead was very entertaining. New Nightmare was another ridiculous movie. Dream warriors has the most death, since it is set in a mental hospital. You know there will be many victims being killed, in a typical entertaining way.

120,coldwaterpdh,A fun and frightening entry in the Elm St. series.,7,23 September 2008,"I couldn't take my eyes off the screen for this one. ""Dream Warriors"" starts out fast and never really slows down. It has some seriously frightening sequences and the camera work is surprisingly timeless. I couldn't really tell this was an early 90's movie. (Besides the Freddy Kruger snake...) Patricia Arquette shows early signs of greatness with her performance here. Lots of genuine scares and a few cheesy jump-outs. But it ain't ""Scream."" No, unlike Craven's later, weaker effort, ""Nightmare On Elm Street 3"" is not formulaic Hollywood junk. Maybe we can thank Frank Darabont (Director of ""The Shawshank Redemption"") for that...he co-wrote the screenplay with Craven. My only complaint with this one is *mild spoiler* how they bring back Heather Langenkamp and she is supposed to be a 'grown up' but she is clearly about 17 years young. That was ridiculous. 7 out of 10, kids.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
121,jcbutthead86,An Excellent Sequel And One Of The Best Films in The Elm Street Series.,10,28 February 2013,"A Nightmare On Elm Street 3:Dream Warriors is easily one of the best films in the Elm Street series,an excellent sequel that's filled with wonderful,atmospheric direction,great characters,haunting imagery and great special effects. It's not only one of my favorites in Elm Street series and one of my favorite Horror movie sequels,but one of my favorite sequels in general.Set six years after the first film,Dream Warriors tells the story about a group of troubled teenagers who are patients at psychiatric hospital who are all having nightmares and are being stalked by dream demon Freddy Krueger(Robert England). Now with the help of Nancy Thompson(Heather Langenkamp,survivor of the first film)and Dr. Neil Gordon(Craig Wasson)the teens are going to figure out how to stop Freddy and get rid of him once and for all.I think one of the reasons Dream Warriors is an excellent sequel is because this takes the concept of Wes Craven's(who co-wrote the script for this film)brilliant,groundbreaking first film and takes a step further with this film. Instead of having Freddy come into your dreams and your nightmares and killing you,DW has Freddy going into teenagers dream worlds and nightmares and taking the things that teenagers like or dislike and turning it against them. It's a scary concept for this film because it makes Freddy more powerful not just from a physical advantage,but a mental advantage. The Nightmare and dream sequences are effective,dark and imaginative and will have you on the edge of your seat with lots of tension and suspense that is like a tightrope and you will feel like you are inside the nightmares and dreams and you want to wake up. The first 10-15 minutes of the film set the tone for the rest of the film,showing viewers a world where teenage suicide is just a normal occurrence and happens all the time. It was pretty daring for a film to take on such a taboo subject like suicide during the 80s(remember this was 2 years before Heathers hilariously tackled the subject of suicide)and I think that's one of the things,along with the dream sequences that add to the dark and Gothic tone of the film and make the film bleaker than it is. The characters in the film are well-developed and likable and when things start to go wrong you will feel sympathy for them and root for them as the film goes on. One of the things that I've always liked about the Elm Street films and what sets them apart from other slasher films is that the characters are not just faceless victims waiting to be killed or slaughtered,but are well-developed characters that viewers can relate to and identify with and this film is no exception. The Action and violence in the film is well-done and fits the tone of this film and while the film is not as completely bloody or gory as the first two films DW has a few moments of blood and gore. The character Freddy Krueger is creepy in this film and spits out darkly funny one-liners something which has divided Horror fans for years as many have said that the film made Freddy from a scary villain to comical one I say yes and no to that. Yes because the later films made him less scarier and more of a comedian and the star of the films no because many fans seem to forget that Freddy had always had a twisted since of humor especially in the first two films that is often overlooked because Freddy was always in the shadows and dark. Freddy's an excellent character and has never been a silent slasher movie villain and the character had to evolve and do more things otherwise the series would've never gone on. I can understand most fans complaints about the Freddy character,but maybe because of his personality and one-liners Freddy's one of my favorite movie characters. The ending of the film will shock and surprise viewers because it's a twist that you will not see coming or expect and is one of the things that adds to the greatness of the film.The whole cast is great in their roles. Heather Langenkamp does a wonderful job as Nancy who returns from the first film to help the teenagers fight Freddy. Craig Wasson does a great job as Dr. Neil Gordan,the doctor who cares about his patients and Wasson has a great chemistry with Langenkamp. Patrica Arquette(in her film debut)is excellent as Kristen,a girl who has a powerful gift. Robert Englund is scary and menacing as Freddy,while saying great one-liners. Laurence Fishburne does a wonderful job as Max an orderly who cares for the patients. Jennifer Ruben does a good job as Taryn,a recovering drug addict who is tough. Ken Sagoes is great as the short-tempered,but sympathetic Kincaid. Nan Martin is creepy as the mysterious nun Sister Mary Helena. John Saxon returns from the first film as Donald Thompson and gives a good performance. Ira Helden does a fine job as Will. Rodney Eastman gives a good performance as Joey,a teen who doesn't talk. Bradley Gregg(Phillip),Penelope Sudrow(Jennifer),Prisilla Pointer(Dr. Simms)and Brooke Bundy(Elaine Parker)give good performances as well. Also lookout for cameos from Dick Cavett and Zsa Zsa Gabor.The direction from Chuck Russell is great,with Russell effective and dark atmosphere giving the film a sense of dread and energy. Great direction.The score by Angelo Badalamenti is creepy and scary and fits with the film's dark tone. Great score. The film also has great songs from Dokken including the great title track Dream Warriors and Into The Fire. Great songs.The special effects in the film are amazing especially with the Freddy make-up and the special effects hold up well.In final word,if you love Horror films or the Nightmare On Elm Street films I highly suggest you see A Nightmare On Elm Street 3:Dream Warriors a great Horror film that is one of best films in the series. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
122,jldmp1,The Imp Of The Perverse,7,27 July 2006,"This marks Craven's writing comeback from the hiccup of ""Freddy's Revenge"".By this time, the simple scares and gross outs were old, and the series had to find its center again; that is, the way Craven uses his writer 'ego' to terrorize us, while his 'alter ego', Freddy, terrorizes the victims within. The 'group' of troubled kids within is composed of exactly the sort of kids he intends to draw as a 'group' - the movie audience. The connection is much more overt than in ""part I"". Poe's 'The Murders in the Rue Morgue' and 'The Pit and the Pendulum' are suggested.This time the movie borrowings include, obviously, ""...Cuckoo's Nest"". But note also ""Vertigo"" (the bell tower) and ""Jason and the Argonauts"" (the fight with the skeleton).In this installment, we see Freddy fully lit for the first time...his trademark one-liners are fully developed here, again to simultaneously play with the victims and to manipulate us through comic relief.Where it goes wrong, I think, is from the problem that arises when Craven brings in the doctor, an adult from 'outside the story' (the adult mind has to reject this movie) and repositions him irrevocably within the story through hypnosis. It spoils what could have been a good, ambiguous structure...the kind that ""part I"" achieved.But it does have one very clever feature, an expansion on the original idea and fully matured here -- the notion of parallel worlds, and specifically that a defeat in one world spells the character's doom in the other world. Think of it as one of the early movie ingredients for ""The Matrix"" series.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
123,Rendanlovell,"Creative and fun, if a little flat",6,6 August 2020,"Lots to like here. New and old is brought together in ways that work very well. You've got Nancy from the original returning, Wes Craven is back, and Freddy is a murder machine once again! But it doesn't tread water with original. In fact, this could easily be a stand alone movie. If none of the other films existed, this would still be quite watchable.The new things here definitely give it the oomph it needed to feel fresh. You've got people actively falling asleep to fight Freddy, in increasingly goofy ways. Which is the main plot. A group of ""suicidal"" teens all share ""delusions"" of the same man. Freddy. Once they realize he isn't simply a delusion, then they become Dream Warriors, as the title suggests.Which sounds goofy, because it is. The film is quite campy but not tongue in cheek. Actually, it takes itself relatively serious. It is definitely aware of its silliness but it rarely points it out. The funny moments are mainly drawn from Freddy taking a ton of pleasure in offing his victims. He takes so much joy in killing, and thankfully, there is no lack of fun kills.This leads back to the films creativity. There are so many inspired, hilarious, or genuinely off putting murders. There's a kill where Freddy puppeteers a guy into jumping off a building, he takes the form of a snake to swallow someone whole, and even throws a wheel chair themed like a midevil torture chamber at a paralyzed guy. It's very silly but because the characters take this threat serious, so can you. Freddy holds no punches and easily lures in victim after victim. Creating a frightening, if goofy, villain.The biggest problem though is said characters. Almost all the side characters have very specific set ups to be paid off in dream land. That's all well and good. No real need to develop side characters more then that really. Yet, the main characters don't grow in the slightest. Nancy from the original is a wet blanket of endless exposition dumps. Wandering between scenes, never learning much or developing much. And the other doctor and her develop a relationship out of nowhere. Neither are interesting nor are they fleshed out going forward, making this strange romance unengaging.There's also some plot threads that come and go seemingly at random. A plot line following a certain dream suppressing drug is specifically baffling. It's set up early on and mysteriously dissappears around the half way mark. I don't know the point of it, and it isn't used later in the film, so why even have it? Plus, some of our heroes are offed in quite unsatisfactory ways. He stabs one with needles and she is never seen again and another is stab by Freddys hand knives and is also never seen again. You'd think the others would at least try to look for them, but instead, they forget they ever existed.At the end of the day, this is pretty enjoyable. It's a tight script in terms of its structure, the side characters are perfectly done, and the campiness is a tightrope masterfully walked . It's not too over the top but it also doesn't take itself very serious either. Throw in some inspired scene transitions and excellent special effects and you'd think you'd have masterpiece on your hands, but it's not that simple. The leads are easily the least interesting aspect here and some plots amount to so little It's odd they are here in the first place.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

T Donald Thompson returns also. We are introduced to Kristen Parker in the first 15 minutes she is having trouble sleeping like in the last 2 movies we had she has a nightmare so she goes to the hospital with the other kids while Nancy is trying to help the other kids and Dr. Neil Gordon is trying to help also while one of the patients does not want to help or care to help them alright so the good in this movie is pretty much all the characters I had zero problems with the characters Freddy is amazing like usual what I noticed that max character is the actor Laurence I was surprised he was in this the kills are cool like the tv kill was cool that was is my fav in this movie Robert Englund is great as Freddy I can't imagine someone else being Freddy as I learned the reboot was the Robert Englund which probably tanks that movie anyway Robert Englund the mixed elements Dr. Elizabeth is annoying all she is doing is not believing the right thing to do to take down Freddy also the ending drags again I don't why so far every film I watched in this franchise it drags that is annoying So all round a very good sequel to the franchise So I give A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors an B+,A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

126,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,"The best goriest sequel in the ""Elm Street"" series, it has the most creative deaths my number one favorite horror slasher film",10,1 February 2019,"The movie is about this girl Kristen Parker (Patricia Arquette) who is refusing to sleep and she is making this paper machete. Her mother forces her to sleep and she dreams about this house and this little girl is following her in house. Than at one point she holds the girl, she is a corpse. Kristen thinks she is awake, that she is still dreaming. She sees reflection of Freddy in the mirror, he silts her wrists. Her mom sews he and finds her and thinks she wants to commit suicide.She sends Kristen to psychiatrist hospital. Where other kids were sent there for a suicide attempt as well. They also experiencing the same nightmare about Freddy Krueger. You got Phillip (Bradley Gregg) which he makes puppets, you got Kincaid (Ken Sagoes) who is a tough guy, you got Taryn (Jennifer Rubin) a drug addict, Joey (Rodney Eastman) who is mute, Will (Ira Heiden) he is by accident paralyzed his in the wheelchair and Jennifer (Penelope Sudrow ) who wants to be an actress. Those are the Dream Warriors. You got Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) returning who become a Westin Hills Psychologist to help kids in the hospital to defend them self against Freddy's fear. In this movie Nancy uses this drug called Hypnocil so that kids want dream about Freddy. So to defeat Freddy they need to put his spirit to rest and they need to use holly water to let the spirit to rest. The only person who know where Freddy's bones are hidden is Nancy's dad (John Saxon). That is the basic story.This is my second favorite goriest slasher film in the Elm Street series it is the best sequel. I know it is people's favorite film A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors and A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) the original film are my number one favorite slasher movies they are equal. I grew up with that film. I never saw this film in my childhood only the first 2 movies and Freddy's Dead I saw as a kid.It has a lot of dream sequences in the story, so many great things, great one liners by Robert Englund. Very invented the guy who is a puppet master he uses wines as strings Freddy uses to pull the guy and throw him off the building. Will has a wizard master powers uses on Freddy and Freddy says I don't believe in fairy tales, great one liners. Really cool stuff, Freddy is a little Freddy and get's bigger and turns in to Freddy which was part of a puppet scene. Big Freddy snake try's to eat Kristen, a lot good stuff in this movie.A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987) is a really good slasher horror movie, it come out the same year as The lost Boys. I have a t-shirt about this movie so much I love it. I do have a frame poster Dream Warriors hang on my wall so much I love this film. It is tied with the original A Nightmare on Elm Street film (1984). Very invented really good dream sequences, Freddy is a bad-ass in this movie, make up is awesome, he looks really good. Special effects FX are really good. They really took advantage of the dreams, they really pushed to limits what they can do. This was definitely a well budget like the last two movies, it was improvement over the second movie. I am glad they went back to basics and that Freddy is a spirit in your dreams I am glad they went back to that.I am a big, big, big fan and I love this movie to death. Directed was by Chuck Russell who did a brilliant direction. The story was written by Wes Craven master him self with Chuck Russell, I love love Heather Langenkamp she is my favorite scream horror actress. I am huge Nancy Thompson fan and I just love her in this movie so much. Patricia Arquette as Kristen Parker was beautiful, smart, vibrant, she put how much heart and sole she has. This was Patricia Arquette's first movie and she was better than Tuesday Knight in my opinion. Jennifer Rubin as Taryn White was beautiful and bad she was A Dream Warrior and she discoveres her very own unique dream power that made her ""beautiful and bad."" When she utilized her dream power, Taryn's appearance changes significantly to a punk biker which is a bad-ass. I love Taryn White. Craig Wasson as Neil Gordon was fantastic and excellent he gaves a hypnocil to those kids so that this dreams stops. He gets holly water on the end Neil finds Fred's remains on a junk yard with Lt. Donald Thompson (John Saxon) the junk yard is my favorite sequence in the movie.A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987) is my number one favorite goriest slasher ever. Great movie, really good movie I recommend this one to Elm Street fans. It is kick ass movie with Dokken on the end of them playing Dream Warriors and of course Into the Fire I love those songs. I love this movie to death, it is an pair with the original.This is a classic and one of the greatest horror slasher movies. I put it in top 10 favorite horror films of all time.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

128,happyendingrocks,"The best sequel with the words ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" in the title... hey, at least that's something",7,30 June 2009,"I must preface this review by admitting a certain sentimental attachment to this third film in the Elm Street franchise, simply because it was the first installment I saw. However, even judging it from the strictest critical eye, Dream Warriors is a worthy successor to the brilliant original, and it certainly has the distinction of being the best sequel of the series that retains ""Elm Street"" in its title.Granted, there isn't a whole lot of competition on that front. While the concept of a maniacal killer who stalks you in your dreams was, and remains, a truly frightening and original punchline for a horror film, it's amazing how many atrocities were done with this powerful concept, as the Nightmare On Elm Street franchise is overall the worst extended horror film series of all time. While horror lore paints Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers, Leatherface, and Pinhead as modern successors to the Dracula, Frankenstein, Wolf Man, and Creature From The Black Lagoon rogues gallery of horror's classic past, Freddy's contributions are by far the most lackluster of the bunch. While the original Nightmare is a certified classic in its own right, the downward slide the series started right after it was only interrupted by Dream Warriors, and to a lesser extent, its follow-up, Part 4: The Dream Master. This duo was followed by a Part 5 that offered very little in the way of notable legacy enhancement, and this was in turn followed by Freddy's Dead, which is a largely unwatchable and pathetic embarrassment to the character. Though Freddy would be re-imagined to fantastic effect with Wes Craven's New Nightmare, which is by far the best true sequel to the original Elm Street (the fun and goofily awesome Freddy Vs. Jason notwithstanding), the Nightmare On Elm Street series boasts almost no sustainability as a franchise. Even though there have been subpar raisings of Hell, unmemorable Friday The 13ths, and massacres of Texas Chainsaws, Nightmare On Elm Street remains perhaps the most problematic horror franchise of all time, simply because so little justice was done to an original concept that seemed to promise so much.But, I'm not here to review the series (although I'm sure I'll get around to each installment before too long). Even ignoring the wretched tripe that followed it, Dream Warriors holds up as a creative and well-executed Freddy tale, and had the film-makers followed the intriguing concept of individuals having powers in the world of their dreams to combat Freddy with, chances are, we would have gotten sequels with much more punch than what stands on the record. Kids with dream powers are certainly a more worthy foil for Freddy than dreaming babies, terrible 3-D effects, and Roseanne Barr cameos.As it stands, not much is done with the idea here, either. We only get a few short glimpses at the powers hinted at in the film, and seeing how quickly a pre-dating Harry Potter wannabe and a Suicide Girls cast-away get thwarted by Freddy, these ""special abilities"" are rendered a bit mediocre.But, for pure visual and visceral panache, Elm Street 3 packs more into its 90-minutes than any other film in the series. The film is almost an homage to special effects, utilizing every trick available at the time, and resurrecting ones that were seldom used in the era. The straight-up splatter is augmented with claymation effects, stop-motion animation, puppetry, and even pure camera tricks. Though Part 4 would employ all of these elements to even more fantastic effect, Dream Warriors maintains a darkness that keeps it true to its horrific centerpiece, while the films that followed continued to explore the fantasy-based elements of the character.Some of the sequences still pack an indelible punch today, and I defy anyone not to cringe at the sleepwalking sequence. I have a friend who will not let anyone touch her wrists, and she told me this phobia stems directly from this scene. The neglect of an erogenous zone because it brings about thoughts of Freddy is certainly a powerful statement about the impact of a well-executed scare.Having Heather Langenkamp and John Saxon back in the fold certainly helps things along, and the great performance from a young Patricia Arquette and equally strong turns from her peers in the film add some credibility to the teens vs. adults crux of the story. And, while Freddy certainly has his wise-cracks here, they aren't as over the top or prevalent as those we'd find in future installments. Here, he doesn't make a quip every 10 seconds, and when he does, most of the lines are witty and morbid enough to enhance, rather than detract from, the brutality.As previously stated, it's a real shame that the series didn't progress forward in the direction hinted at here. For sure, we would have had future installments that were more scary than silly, and the Freddy character might have maintained what little menace he had left when Dream Warriors came out. A subsequent film that centered itself around the idea of actual Dream Warriors, with complementary dream powers that were fully developed and explored, certainly couldn't have been worse than what we ended up getting.In the end, Dream Warriors remains a brief ray of light in a series that degenerated into nauseating disappointment. For that, it certainly deserves notice, and those who never revisited this chapter because of the sour taste left by The Dream Child and Freddy's Dead should give this outing another shot. We'll see how much life Freddy has left in him, but if his legacy has already been largely carved, Dream Warriors deserves to be mentioned on the tombstone.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
129,Toronto85,A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors,9,22 March 2011,"A Nightmare on Elm St. 3 is definitely a step up from part 2, and just as good as the original for different reasons. Some of the cast from the original return to face off against Freddy one more time. Heather Langenkamp reprises her role as Nancy and John Saxon once again plays her father, this time as an angry alcoholic. The film starts out with a young girl named Kristen (Patricia Arquette) who has a terrifying dream of Freddy. She gets committed to the town's psychiatric hospital where we learn that all of the kids in the place are having the same dreams that involve a burned man trying to kill them. After Nancy joins the hospital staff, a few of the teens start being murdered by Krueger, each death though looks like a suicide. Nancy of course knows exactly what's going on. With the help of fellow doctor Neil Gordon (Craig Wasson), Nancy takes the teenagers into the dream world to take on Freddy Krueger.Nightmare 3 is definitely the most imaginative and creative of all the Freddy sequels. The dreams the kids have are very well done. The kid in the wheelchair who likes magic and wizards is able to walk in his dreams. Kincaid has super human strength, so on and so forth. I love the fact that all the teens have a special power in their dreams which they can use against Freddy. Some of the deaths are very well done as well with regards to special effects. One of the more memorable kills is when Freddy shoves a young girls head into the television set with shouting ""welcome to prime time, bitch"".The problem with Nightmare 2 was that it moved at such a slow pace. The characters were not interesting and had very little potential. Bringing back Nancy and her dad helped this sequel immensely. And most of the teens in the hospital are likable and have redeeming qualities, especially Kristen and Taryn (Jennifer Rubin). Freddy is also seen during much of the film, which was ANOES 2's downfall.A must see film for any horror/fantasy fan. One of the better sequels in the franchise if not the best.9/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
130,Gresh854,A Solid Follow Up That Should've Been Part 2,7,6 August 2018,"A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 3: Dream Warriors is actually a solid, competently made sequel that should've been the direct follow-up from the original A Nightmare on Elm Street instead of Part 2: Freddy's Revenge. There isn't anything awfully laughable or cringy in this movie that most horror sequels will often suffer from. It conclusively, offers an exceptional add-on story in the Freddy Krueger saga. All the actors/actresses give strong performances, however, the film suffers partially because of character development. This movie would've really benefited from a more thorough and thought-out script, so I could actually have something to emotionally latch onto throughout the movie's runtime. The film seems to be more dependent on the kills and action set-pieces-especially towards the finale-rather than the plot itself, which is massively holding it back from being ""great."" That being said, Dream Warriors is still one of the better horror sequels I've seen, and certainly provides some of the most creatively wicked kills (AND THERE ARE SO MANY OF THEM!!!) this franchise has had yet to offer. (Verdict: B-) 6.5/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
131,Mr_Censored,Welcome to primetime!,8,15 October 2008,"Making up for a lack of consistency in ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge,"" the third installment in the series switched gears, added more characters, brought some back and gave the legend of Freddy new life. With better productions values, better gore and better actors, it's hard to go wrong. But it's the return of Heather Langenkamp and John Saxon, along with creator Wes Craven that is the icing on the cake. ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors"" is bigger, bolder and badder than it's predecessor and, in short, is the finest sequel in the entire series.Freddy's influence upon the children of Elm Street (and likely, the entire town) has gotten so bad that the children are being locked away in Westin Hills, a psychiatric hospital where the patients are anything but safe. Like the kids in the original ""Nightmare,"" this group shares a dream but are united when a maverick doctor, who just happens to be our heroine, Nancy, from the first film, helps them unite and face Freddy. Overcoming their worst fears and finding their own power within the dreams, the teenagers eventually work up the courage to face Freddy one on one. In this film, we are introduced to the Freddy that has become a mainstream icon. This is the joker Freddy, the one that cracks one-liners and offs his prey in some rather ironic ways. For better or for worse, this is the rebirth of Freddy, and the turning point where he became the main character. So, unfortunately, despite some of it's grisly death scenes (human marionette, anyone?), the creepiness factor that even ""Freddy's Revenge"" had has all but vanished. No longer relegated to the boiler room, Freddy has become a star. Speaking of stars, however, look out for a young Patricia Arquette and Laurence Fishburne, who would go on to have budding careers after this film was released. Overall, ""The Dream Warriors"" is a classic 80's horror movie. It's got great special effects, a great cast, a rocking, if not, dated soundtrack and some of the best gore the series has to offer. Despite turning Freddy into a punchline, this movie helped get the series back on track and set the standard for the rest of the series to come.

A classic film and a fantastic sequel and definitely my favourite in the Nightmare Franchise. This has a fantastic story and great characters and the best Freddy in my opinion the perfect mix of horror and Comedy that suits this franchise.The story in this one is amazing the idea of people fighting back using the powers in there dreams is such a great idea and great twist for this franchise. I love seeing Nancy again and her story in this one Is amazing she is definitely the best final girl of this series.The other characters are fantasic Tanya and Kincaid being the highlights for me as part of the team. Kristen is also a very interesting character and the power she has of bringing people into her dreams is very interesting.The kills and Freddy scenes are fantastic in this one and very creative I like seeing Freddy as a giant snake and my favourite moment is definitely the Puppet Kill the effects are still great in them scenes and Freddy using someone's tendons to use him as a puppet is still creepy but great to watch.There are some dated effects and the Wizard Master scene does seem a little out of place in my opinion but nothing that ruins the movie.
And the backstory we get for Freddy is so interesting and adds and extra of terror to the character Freddy being son of 100 Maniacs just makes him more creepy. And Amanda Kreuger is a welcomed addition to the franchise.Verdict 9.5/10 a fantastic sequel and my favourite of the franchise the best mix of Horror and Comedy and this is Freddy at his best, great characters and fantastic kills and a great story make this a fun ride from start to finish.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

My favorite was TV room scene. I also find this movie being really creepy sometimes, what is not usual for slasher films, like that scene where Freddy made one of the kids fall from a window, the whole scene was kinda creepy.

134,AwesomeWolf,"Entertaining, and much much better than Freddy's Revenge",7,14 September 2005,"'A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge' is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. With that in mind, I thought that 'A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors' couldn't be any worse. Bam, 'Dream Warriors' was actually pretty good, probably due largely to Wes Craven returning as the writer and not having anything to do with 'Freddy's Revenge'.One by one, the teenagers of Elm Street have been committed to the Springwood psychiatric facility. All have been having nightmares, and all apparently attempted suicide. The senior doctors blame a mass psychosis on moral guilt and attention seeking, but the new intern is none other than Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp), the heroine of the first 'A Nightmare on Elm Street'. Nancy is now a psychology student specializing in dream therapy. When Nancy discovers that Kristen (Patrica Arquette) - one of the patients - can pull people into her dreams, Nancy resolves to take the Elm Street kids into Kristen's dream for one more stand against Freddy.'Dream Warriors' is easily one of the stronger entries in the Elm Street series. The story is far more involved in fantasy / horror than it is in horror. 'Dream Warriors' is well written, and much more engaging than the second Elm Street movie (Freddy's Revenge). Instead of attempting more of the same like 'Freddy's Revenge' did, 'Dream Warriors' is much more imaginative and expands on the Elm Street / Freddy Krueger story and explores new territory. We get new insight into Freddy's origin, and an interesting - but sometimes unsettling - new story as Nancy and the kids manipulate their dreams to fight back against Freddy. The characters in 'Dream Warriors' are far more likable and sympathetic than the characters in 'Freddy's Revenge'. I felt sorry the kids, unlike in the second film when I was hoping Freddy would off Jesse soon just so the movie would be over.Naturally, 'Dream Warriors' is filled with 80s cheese. Some of the SFX hold up today, but others are just incredibly cheesy. In between serious moments, we have dream moments in which the kids proclaim to be ""the Wizard Master"" or ""beautiful and bad"". It is oh so very cheesy. Heather Langenkamp isn't as convincing as she was in the first, and doesn't even seem to be trying while John Saxon in a brief return as Nancy's father. The soundtrack even features several songs by 80s metal band Dokken - you know you love 80s metal.'Dream Warriors' is one of the better Elm Street movies.

But its plagued by being slow, sloppy and badly acted. Once again the good moments are when freddy is onscreen. Besides that you're just wishing the movie got on with it.The script is what let me down the most. I hated how they wrapped up the Nancy + dad story. It felt incredibly out of place and just bad in general. Also, once again this movie starts by frustratingly having to go through the whole process of people not believing it. Though the male doctor turns around real quick and there's zero motivation why.Also, the lines between what Freddy can do in dreams and out of them becomes really vague. Also the group dreams are just odd in general and it's hard to follow how it all works, whereas in part 1 it was clear cut. Here it's much more messy.The directing was sloppy in general, camera's shaking, weird timings. And editing was meh overall.Yeah, this review has been pretty negative, and it might as well be a rant. But I just felt letdown.There were some creative dream sequences and some cool sets, but I'd still rate the dreams in part 1 to be much more effective.

137,HorrorFan1984,A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors,9,11 April 2020,"Freddy Krueger is back to kill the last of the Elm Street children, but this time he'll have to face a group of Dream Warriors who are ready to fight back.Kristen Parker is a teenager living on Elm Street .. which can only mean one thing. She is experiencing dreams of Freddy Krueger. After an attack by him during a nightmare which looks like a suicide attempt, Kristen's mother puts her away in a psychiatric hospital for young people. It's here we meet six other teenagers all experiencing nightmares involving the same disfigured man trying to kill him.Nancy Thompson (our heroine from the first) returns as a dream specialist, brought in to work with the youth to help them get past these dreams they all share. One night while Kristen is having a Freddy nightmare, she pulls Nancy into her dream. With her ability to pull people into her nightmares, Nancy comes up with a plan to have all the teenagers in there together to take down Krueger once and for all. She'll have to battle not only Freddy, but a hospital staff that are very skeptical of her methods to save the children.Creativity. This movie has lots of it. Way more than the sequel, and I might argue more than the original. When it comes to the dream sequences and deaths, the visuals are top notch and interesting to watch. Some of the stuff we see in Part 3 clearly paved the way for the following sequels. We also meet Sister Mary Helena who explains the birth of Freddy Krueger and that he was the son of 100 maniacs due to the rape of Freddy's mother Amanda. This storyline is further explored in parts 5 and 6 to help explain why Freddy was the way he was.The cast is young, fresh, and energized. Each bringing their own spin to their troubled characters locked away in an institution. Patricia Arquette as Kristen is the lead of the young teenagers and she is so rootable and likeable. A perfect fit to go up against Krueger. Heather Langenkamp is just as impressive as Nancy. She plays her so much more mature as an adult, and we get all the beats of her trauma dealing with the events from the first film.A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 is an excellent horror film and third entry to the series. We get Heather Langenkamp back, way more Freddy Krueger than ever before, and visually appealing and creative dream sequences. Highly recommended.9/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
138,Torgo_Approves,"Freddy's Best! ""Welcome to prime time, bitch!""",7,17 March 2007,"I liked the original Elm Street film but let's face it, most of the sequels are cheap and stupid to the point of being dull. Dream Warriors is the shining exception - it's a brilliantly fun movie which actually has a solid plot and more than passable acting. DW's plot wisely ignores the laughfest Freddy's Revenge and starts off where the first movie ended. A collection of teens, plagued by nightmares all starring the same boogeyman (guess who?), are locked up at a mental hospital where clueless doctors try to get to the bottom of their situation. When Nancy Thompson (a very cute Heather Langenkamp) - the sole survivor of the original Elm Street film - shows up, the kids finally get to talk to someone who knows what they're going through. Too bad for them that Freddy's getting bored with just scaring the kids in their sleep - soon the bodies begin to pile up and our protagonists have to learn quickly how to bend their dreams to their advantage as one of the hospital's doctors learns more about Fred Krueger's dark history...This film is far from perfect but did you really expect a masterpiece? It is a fun, entertaining movie with imaginative death scenes and an awesome use of effects. The film was made by Chuck Russell, who went on to direct the hilarious and equally SFX-crazy Jim Carrey comedy The Mask seven years later, and he does a great job maintaining a consistent mood of humour and creepiness. The acting is the best in the entire series with Heather Langenkamp, Laurence Fishburne, John Saxon and a young Patricia Arquette in the leads. Craig Wasson is mediocre but watchable in his key role as Dr. Neil Gordon. Robert Englund is as deliciously demented as always and has a lot of fun in another over-the-top performance as Freddy.The previously mentioned death scenes are spectacular and hilarious and the dialogue has some truly great one-liners in store for Freddy. Not a movie to be overanalyzed or compared to Kubrick, yet despite a few corny moments, Dream Warriors is still an entertaining and surprisingly re-watchable, wonderfully tongue-in-cheek movie for the Freddy fan in all of us.""What a rush!""",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
139,schroeder-gustavo,A lot of Fun!,8,5 June 2015,"So it's probably a guilty pleasure. So what? It's still 8x better than Freddy's Revenge and as a fan of Freddy and horror and gore films, you just gotta love Dream Warriors. First thing I love about the movie is that 80's feel, but the 80's in a good way: from the first scene with Patricia Arquette drinking soda and listening to Into the Fire, OH so good. Also, Dream Warriors has some of the best and most imaginative kills and stunts of the series. Memorable moments like Freddy the puppeteer or Freddy the TV make this a fan favorite. Also props for the amazing practical effects. They just don't do them like that anymore. If this movie would have come out this year, it would have been all CGI and jump-scares. But it didn't, and I'm a happy man. Dream Warriors works perfectly as a sequel to the original and, although definitely not better, has its own beauty.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

141,hoernkeem,"A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987, Chuck Russell) While not as good as the original the return of Craven & Langencamp is a creative boost",7,29 September 2021,"The third iteration of the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' franchise was released in 1987, two years after the first sequel debuted. 'Freddy's Revenge' was a clown show and was more tongue in cheek and silly than horror and skewed away from much of what Craven instilled in the original that made it great. It was such a failure that another film in the franchise was not a forgone conclusion. 'Dream Warriors' comes along and has a story and screenplay developed, in part, by Craven and it also returns Heather Langenkamp to a primary role who played Nancy in the first film as she is ostensibly the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' universe princess. Not only that but film features roles for future stars Patricia Arquette and Larry Fishburne. The film was directed by Chuck Russell who would go on to have a functional Hollywood directorial career working on such projects as Jim Carrey's 'The Mask' and Schwarzenegger's 'Eraser' as well as working on the Fox drama 'Fringe'.A year after the events of the previous film teenager Kristen Parker, played by Arquette, is plagued by vivid dreams of a burned man with knives for fingers. Her family, believing her to be crazy, places her in a psychiatric hospital. There we meet other similarly haunted teenagers. We also meet a new therapist intern at the hospital; none other than Nancy Thompson, the protagonist from the original film with Langenkamp reprising her role. All the kids realize they are dreaming of the same haunting enemy, Freddy Krueger. With Nancy's aid they realize they all have power within their dreams and Kristen is extra special as she can pull people into her dreams thus they can all share in her dream and attack Freddy on a united front. Freddy gets in his torments and kills, but ultimately they battle him successfully on the dream front leaving time for allies to find his bones in the real world and lay them to rest in essence ""killing"" the dream version of Freddy. Nancy is killed, however, in the battle, but she died satisfied in the knowledge that she saved some of her kids and Freddy was destroyed.While not a rival to the original film this movie was head and shoulders above the second one. This was dark and creepy and haunting. Sure it had some 80's cheesiness, but that is just the sign of the pop culture at the time rather than a truly negative underpinning of the film. With Craven's creative input and Langenkamp returning the film was able to flourish, and this movie put the idea of Freddy attacking kids in their dreams once more at the forefront which is right where this series needs to operate if it is going to be successful, and the 3rd film was quite successful grossing over $44 million on only a $4 million budget. While this film was meant to be a series finale with the financial success Freddy was soon raised from the dead once more to haunt kids nightmares. This is actually a pretty fun and entertaining entry into the 'Nightmare' series and is really the true sequel to Craven's outstanding original.Eric's Grade: B-",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
142,RickHarvey,Nightmare On Elm Street 3,5,17 April 2012,"The title to this film makes it sound like a Marvel adaption. Dream warriors is a decent enough film which will satisfy your Freddy needs. You see plenty off him compared to the 2nd film, but only this time, he is more of comedian than a child killer.When i watched this many years ago, i instantly thought how inferior it was to the 2nd film. I've changed my mind. His attire hasn't changed a bit but his method of killing and even his voice has made him adapt to a new humorous persona. Some might find this good; while others will miss the darker Freddy from the the first 2 films.Now, rather than tricking you into believing you're still awake in the real world, Freddy now has a world of his own in which he finds many imaginative ways to kill his children.Several deaths are gruesome and makes Freddy seem more eviler than he ever could in previous films but the one -liners that boast out off Freddy's seconds before the poor sods imminent deaths will either make you cringe or spill your beans.Sadly, the acting has been turned down a notch. As great as it was to see Nancy again, her good acting couldn't help the others to turn up to the game. The short-fused black kid made you wish for Freddy to kill him off quickly; the wannabe actor was horrible and it is best to leave things unsaid about the Wizard Master. The junkie girl i thought was decent enough.It's a mix bag this film. Some parts are entertaining but not once are you frightened - something you never feel in the remaining films. The final act showcases an instant bout of tremendous stupidity wash over one of the main characters which will make you scream at the TV.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

It gave the movie more continuity, unlike part II where no characters return; except Freddy.There were some creative (and nasty) deaths which could be seen as trademarks for the series. But you watch these movie usually for that, or for Freddy if you're a fan.I liked how the story developed. There was some strange hocus-pocus going on this time, but it wasn't really over-the-top. I liked the extra background story we got as well. It adds to the series' quality.In overall, I can say that Nightmare 3 is certainly a good part of the series.

145,shaun98,Surprisingly good sequel (possible spoiler),7,12 April 2002,"After the disappointing ""Freddy's Revenge,"" the third ""Nightmare"" film offers a much-needed shot in the arm to the series. It's one of these rare sequels that actually match the original. Indeed, it could be argued which one is better. Part 2 is ignored in favor of directly tying in to the original. Nancy, the heroine from Part 1, returns as a psychology student attempting to aid traumatized teenagers, who are all being stalked by the infamous Freddy Krueger.Freddy himself is beginning to emerge as a wisecracking antihero, with the one-liners that would become his trademark in later entries. Nonetheless, there are several startling nightmare scenes. Each is imaginatively conceived, with ghoulishly clever special effects.Dream Master's most glaring flaw is Heather Langenkamp herself. Her performance is surprisingly wooden, given the spunk she displayed in the original. However, Craig Watson, as the sympathetic doctor, is quite good. And of course, Robert Englund steals every scene he's in. John Saxon makes a welcome return as Nancy's alcoholic father, and Laurence Fishburne is solid in one of his early film roles, although he's a bit underused.This is the only sequel Wes Craven was involved with. Taking on dual writer-producer roles, it's obvious he was trying to put the series to rest before it could become another ""Friday the 13th"" franchise. Alas, he failed. Nonetheless, NOES 3 deserves credit for actually providing a sense of closure at the end. For once the door is not left open for a sequel.*** (out of ****)Released by New Line Cinema",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

148,toqtaqiya2,This surreal fantasy is the best of the Elm Street sequels.,7,2 November 2012,"If there's one film that matches the original A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984) this is it. The original was made on a small budget ($1.8 million) but showed once again that with creativity you can make a great horror film. A Nightmare On Elm Street 3 was made on a larger budget ($4.5 million) and it shows. The sets and the special effects are impressive. But its biggest strength is its cast of talented young actors, including Patricia Arquette, Ken Sagoes, Bradley Gregg and Jennifer Rubin. The return of Freddy's babe Heather Langenkamp and John Saxon is an additional treat. Angelo Badalamenti provided the effective score while the heavy metal band Dokken provided the film's two catchy tunes, Dream Warriors and Into The Fire. Roy H. Wagner's cinematography adds to the already effective atmosphere. In addition to all this the film is thrilling. Wes Craven and Bruce Wagner worked on the script, but the results aren't confusing but interesting. Here we get to find out about Freddy Krueger's past. Krueger kills his victims in a number of inventive ways, all of which are aided by excellent special effects. The sets in the dream world, full of atmosphere, are memorable. But my favorite set is the auto salvage yard. I can list other reasons why this film is such a treat. It's a neat product of the 80s, and it showed that sequels don't have to be inferior.

I was so excited to watch this one and see her return. This one is also cool because John Saxon returns to play her father and Wes Craven while not directing did write this one and that is why it delves into Freddy's background more than the other movies. I love how we get to see his mother and hear how he was conceived. His mother's back story for me is actually what scares me about this one, when I found out she was ghost I freaked out. I think Robert Englund did another stellar job reprising his main role, if anyone ever tries to fill in his shoes I will go insane. The Dream Warrior idea in this one was good to as it made it where the series could go on and make more movies and make sense. While part 2 is good it does not make any sense.

153,metalrox_2000,Never kill the stories hero,6,1 October 2005,"Overall, Nightmare 3 was a decent, if unremarkable entry into the Elm Street series. Freddy Kruger dispenses with the usual batch of teens with shift and cold heartedness. You even have to like some of the tongue in cheek humor in the film. It doesn't take itself too seriously, yet still provides enough chills and thrills to satisfy the horror film fan. Bringing back John Saxon and Heather LagenKamp was a brilliant move. How ever, Freddy needed a face character to feed off. Someone to be a foil to his grand schemes. Nightmare 3 had that going, and it helped the film. But, at the end, everything that was right about the film, suddenly went wrong. Killing off Nancy Thompson at the end was, without a doubt, perhaps one of the dumbest mistakes ever made in film history. No, it is THE dumbest mistake ever made. Sherlock Holmes needed his Professor Moriaty, Luke needed his Darth Vader. You need that clear battle between good and evil. Having a struggle between Nancy and Freddy take place over the next few films would have brought a justifiable end to the series. This all went out the window because some amateur, some Nimrod who does not understand what makes a strong story killed off the only character that should have had the last go around with Freddy. Hey, i wouldn't have mind if the series ended the way Sherlock Holmes did, with both Kruger and Thompson going to death with each other as Holmes and Moriaty did in the series. That would of been a better end to the series. Instead, we have to go over the top, and push implausibility with 4 and 5 until Freddy was dead. Alas, what should of been never was, and the heroine was killed off way before her time.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
154,Derek237,Easily the best of the sequels,6,1 August 2003,"Dream Warriors is without a doubt the best Elm Street sequel. The first 2 dealt with just one main character against Freddy and everyone else thinking they're crazy. But of course, after a while people start realizing they're all dreaming about Freddy. And If he can use their dreams against them, they can also use their dreams against him. Brilliant!This is where the deaths became more elaborate and Freddy started to spout out catchy one-liners. A lot of people resent this film for starting the whole 'joker Freddy' trend, but this has just the right amount of Freddy wit to still have him be scary and threatening, which really he is.This is the most exciting, thrilling, imaginative Freddy movie of the bunch.

156,The-Social-Introvert,Quickie Review: A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors,6,18 April 2016,"Nightmare 3 feels far more connected to the original film than the second one. Heather Langenkamp returns as Nancy Thompson, now a psychiatrist, to fight Freddy Kruger. She attempts through her mediocre acting skills to support a group of teenage mental patients who are all institutionalized due to the horrific dreams they have and their subsequent outbursts. This film is far creepier and downright scary compared to its predecessor. Some of Kruger's kills really gives me the willies and the use of children's screams to set the tone for the dream scenes really tells you all you need to know about the scare levels. The gruesome death scenes hold a bit of weight as you do care (even a little) about the main characters and there is one ballsy death that is truly an oh-no-they-didn't moment. It's also cool how we get a little insight into Kruger's freaky backstory.Some of it gets a little hokey towards the end (stop-motion skeleton fights and wizard battles?!) but that's to be expected with a lot of these 80's horror films. Also Nancy is a bit dumb compared to how she was in the original (there was no way she'd fall for Kruger's mirror trick). There are one or two plot holes and inconsistencies spread throughout the film, but that doesn't take away from the fact that this is a solid entry in the Elm Street franchise. Best Scene: Definitely the puppet strings kill. That heart-breaking scene really spooked me",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
157,jcslawyer,Fantastic. The sequel we deserved.,8,9 February 2020,"I think everyone can agree that this one is up there as far as sequels go. In fact, I wish they would just retitle 2 as A Side Job for Fred so that this could be the actual sequel to the first one. We rented this when i was a kid after it was released on video (didn't rent from Blockbuster, wasn't around yet). I remember it being genuinely scary and dark. It keeps that creepy atmosphere from the first and takes it to a new place....literally and metaphorically.In this one, we meet Kristen Parker who lives with her mom in the burbs in a pretty nice house. Her mom sucks and drinks, so Kristen has a sucky homelife. Of course that doesn't stop Fred from haunting her. However there's something unique about Kristen....she can interact and bring stuff out of her dreams and pull others into hers. Looking back, it's cheesy af. But it works for this movie.On one occasion, which is extremely scary for anyone with those kinds of faucet handles, she is attacked by Freddy whose razor hand manifests in a faucet handle and cuts her wrist. When her mom bursts in, Kristen appears to have slit them herself. Of course, no one's gonna believe her so they take her to a mental hospital for treatment. There she meets a group of other suicide survivors...and it turns out they all share more in common....Freddy. Now that Kristen's there, Freddy can use her to have others brought into dreams to kill. And he does...One other thing is that Nancy from the first one is at the hospital in some clinical capacity. Although she's not directly affiliated. She is able to explain what's going on a little better than anyone else, but at the end of the day it's not enough to save the kids, herself, or her dad. Only 3 survive the movie: Kristen, Kincaid, and Joey.The movie also adds a little more backstory to Freddy by introducing a weird ghost nun. She keeps appearing to one of the main characters, a counselor, just to say some weird stuff and be creepy. It opens the mythos, but doesn't go too far.Effects are pretty good. The snake Freddy is creepy, the rando door that leads down to some rando lair, the marionette kid, etc. Kills are clever. Freddy hasn't gotten too cheesed out yet, but you can tell they were trying to add some more depth, including humor.It really is a good sequel worthy of following the first. You will not be disappointed.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
158,dudedazzreviews,The third nightmare is the best dream!,7,6 October 2010,"After watching the appalling A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge, I decided to brave it out and carry on with the series and to my surprise, this was actually a great sequel. The story is very good and is entertaining but it isn't really very scary although it probably was when it was released. The characters were done very good as we see our old favourite heroine Nancy return along with some 'suicidal' teenagers, one of which is Patricia Arquette who plays the troubled Kristen. The character development is well done as yet again you see the scared teenagers turn intowelldream warriors. The acting was great as Heather Langenkamp returns as the tough Nancy and Robert Englund as the scary Freddy Krueger. Patricia Arquette should also be praised for her performance as Kristen as should the rest of the cast. The direction is done very well and the nightmare scenes were done brilliantly as this takes a more comedic turn to the previous Nightmares.I really did enjoy this one, it's definitely improved from the second one but, as expected, it doesn't beat the first one. This one isn't so scary but this is more of a dark horror comedy if anything because of the one-liners Freddy uses although the idea of Freddy Kruger is still quite a terrifying one. The special effects and the nightmare scenes were brilliantly executed and I loved how Robert Englund had truly left his mark as the only one who should be Freddy. Overall, this definitely beats the second and is very enjoyable but it's not on the same level as the first, which was to be expected.Read more reviews on: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

A very good film,compared to part 2...And is also as good as part one.The acting was stable,i really liked Heather Langenkamps performance.Part 3 didnt have much humour into it,i admire that.Freddy is bad in this one. I think Patricia Arquettes performance was fair along with the rest of the cast.This film really is set in a dark concept,and was really enjoying to watch.This film had ""mediocore"" special FX compared to the sequels.I wouldnt call this film a ""classic"",but i would call it one of the best of 87.This was where the ""Good"" freddy films ended,which is such a shame,as their are so many wasted sequels.Hopefully Freddy VS Jason may prove me wrong.Nightmare part 3 was a great film,spooky at times.Watch it. I rated this movie a 7 out of 10. ***1/2 / *****",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
162,BenTramerLives78,Welcome To Primetime,10,15 December 2020,"""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" is one of the greatest horror films of all time, and let's be honest, it is one of the greatest films of all time. Wes Craven made a masterpiece and then had nothing to do with the sequel that was released one year later. Craven comes back to the series as writer only for ""The Dream Warriors"".The third film in the Elm Street series is about a bunch of suicidal teens in a hospital who are being terrified by madman Freddy Krueger. The final girl of the first film, Nancy Thompson, is back as a psychologist, sent to help the patients through their terrifying dreams. Nancy's father is back as well and this time we find out that he's become an alcoholic after the events of the first film.As for the teens, we have the usual group; one girl is a drug addict, one is a nerd, one is a mute, one aspires to be an actress, one makes puppets, one is a tough guy, and one is having problems with her mother. The characters are stereotypical teens but as an audience, we really feel for these people and the connections they've made.The kill scenes are really interesting and the story is quite good for a horror film. Robert Englund's Freddy begins using the comical one liners he would become famous for in future sequels, but this is still a dark film like the previous two entries in the franchise.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
163,WrathChld,New Life,6,3 July 2006,"The third installment in the Elm Street series is one of the coolest in my opinion. Of course you cannot beat the original and by no means do I think it was better than the first. This one starts off with Kristin building a paper machea house of the original Elm Street house. After a failed ""suicidal"" attempt, Kristin is put into a mental hospital. Where she meets other teens that have struggled with nightmares. The hospital brings in Nancy, the girl from the original Nightmare, who helps the teens deal with their dreams. The coolest part of this when the teens enter their dreams they have special powers. The more to challenge Freddy with. There are plenty of great affects in this movie which are some of the greatest parts about viewing Nightmare movies. Plus, we have Freddy's great lines. He is a wise a$$. This movie also reveals many things about the overall story line, which is really cool.Sweet Dreams!",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
164,mattressman_pdl,The best Nightmare sequel by far,8,10 December 2007,"Chuck Russell(Eraser) directs this second sequel to A Nightmare on Elm Street, this time with a hand from the creator of the franchise: Wes Craven. What results breathes fresh life into these films and turns into one of the most crowd pleasing sequels of all time.A group of teenagers, all children whose parents vigilantism created Freddy Kruger, are confined to a mental institution. The staff feel that their shared psychosis of 'Freddy Kruger' is all made up. But when the last Elm street children start dying off one by one, it's up to Nancy Thompson and Dr. Gordon to find the secret to Freddy and stop him once and for all.The wild card in this entry is that each of the survivors can use a dream 'power' against Freddy, making them Dream Warriors. Sounds a little corny but it comes off extremely entertaining and fulfilling.Also, a new Freddy-line is born: ""Welcome to Prime Time, B****.""",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
165,Colbridge,Smartly done sequel that is much closer to the original,5,13 November 2021,"The third instalment of the Nightmare on Elm Street series gets the franchise back on track after the misguided direction of A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge (1985). Wes Craven returns to oversee the production while director Chuck Russell does a great job in delivering an imaginative horror movie that puts Freddy Krueger firmly back in dream land. Heather Langenkamp is a welcome familiar face from the original as is John Saxon who plays her dad and Robert Englund is as reliable as ever as Freddy.In 'Dream Warriors' Freddy preys on teens in a mental hospital, many of whom have sleeping disorders, and subsequently get terrorised by the evil serial killer in their sleep until Nancy, now a psychiatrist, teaches them how to use their special abilities to defeat Krueger. While the film deals with depression, anxiety and suicide it's not as dismal as it sounds, even though Patricia Arquette is often reduced to screaming her way through many scenes with little else to do.Craig Wasson anchors the film as the doctor who looks after the young patients and the film is much better cast than it's predecessor. Chuck Russel and writer Frank Darabont (who would later go on to bigger success with The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile) have crafted a Nightmare film much closer to the original and ticks all the right boxes, from the clever dream sequences and physical effects to the ambition in the script to be more imaginative and to try new things, even if they don't always pay off.All in all this is smartly done and a very satisfying sequel that honours Wes Craven's original. The Nightmare on Elm Street concept is a great platform for filmmakers, writers and actors to jump off from and to get really creative because in your dreams there are no limits.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

Which begs the question: Why is it so difficult for film makers to turn out quality horror sequels? You'd actually think it would be easier for writers to work with an established idea? Anyway, ""Nightmare 3"" is great stuff. It's great because the Elm Street kids are all very likable. Heather Langenkamp returns from part 1 as Nancy and brings a nostalgic feel to the picture. Craig Wasson, playing Dr. Neil Gordon, is absolutely wonderful and very likable. And of course, Englund, is stellar; as he spews out Kruger one liners. Part 3 is actually pretty well written, as the children are able to fight back in the nightmares using their imaginations; a wonderful concept that's foolishly abandoned after this sequel. Did I forget to mention the special effects? Because THEY ARE incredible! The rock band Dokken adds to all this greatness with the song ""Into The Fire"", which was incidentally replaced with the track ""Quiet Cool"" by Jay Ferguson on Laser-disk issues. So all in all, this is one of the better horror sequels around; it really has everything going for it. I highly recommend it.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

One thing that this film has that sequels like 4 & 5 don't have is a strong plot. I like the idea of why he after these children and not just anybody.

The new cast of teenage characters are likable and diverse and you really feel for them. Some of the effects could be considered dated, but they still have way more charm than most CGI junk these days. It's wonderful to have Heather Langenkamp and John Saxon return as Nancy and Lt.

I can't think of a better way to make a great sequel and pay so much respect to the original. I love all of the main characters in this movie. Patricia Arquette is great as Kristen, and Ken Sagoes as Kincaid is one of my favorite side characters ever. The other teens are also very good characters and entertaining to watch. I also really like Craig Wasson as Dr. Gordon in this film.The Freddy Krueger we get in this movie (played by the legend Robert Englund) is my favorite version of the famous villain in the whole series. The comedy and horror was never balanced better than in Dream Warriors. Also, the stop motion in this film is surprisingly good for a 1987 slasher flick.Now if there's anything negative people talk about regarding this film, it's that one wizard scene. I know it's cheesy and all, but I really do enjoy it, so that's not a negative for me.I think that this is the greatest Nightmare movie & horror sequel of all time because in my mind, this is a flawless movie for what it's going for. For the most part I can't say if I like John Carpenter's Halloween more than this film, that's how much I love it!Horror: A- (Some Great Horror Elements.

Robert Englund is back as the man of our dreams Freddy Kruger he has some new and creative ways to get his victims and i love him in this movie because in the second i was very disappointed and there was a return of a old character Nancy Thompson played by heather Langenkamp and man was so happy with them bringing her back and she portrayed like the first time she was awesome. the other cast members were Patricia Arquette, Ken Sagoes, Rodney Eastman, Jennifer Rubin,Bradley Gregg,Ira Heiden and Penelope Sudrow they were the backbone cast that we saw and they were new faces and that's always what we need is to see more people who will be Freddy's victims.
I have to say that this movie compared to the second and first one it was very good not as good as the original but it for me was very close so i would say early on in this series i have been disappointed and impressed but more impressed more so far..",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

It has Freddy playing his usual role and has some comeback characters. This made sense and moved at a nice pace. They managed to show Freddy at the right times with a little comedy mixed in. All the characters have good development and the ending was unexpected. All in all a good movie. My rating 6/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

The first one did not have nearly the effects budget of this one, but it was still erie and creepy. this one had a few things going for it but my main problem would have to be
*spoiler*Arquette Didn't die. Also, It gave me a bias against Dungeons and dragons that didn't go away until just recently.Good points: As I've said, incredibly better than 2 or anything that came after it. A better horror movie than any Friday the thirteenth or any Halloween greater than 2.

But the only real way to kill Freddy, it is revealed, is to give his remains a proper burial.Without doubt this is the best Nightmare sequel.

175,jhigginbotham151,We Are Dream Warriors!,8,18 May 2014,"Has anybody noticed that unlike Nightmares contemporaries like Halloween, Friday The 13th and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Nightmare On Elm Street since Freddys Revenge has practically embodied the 80s in every way. The cheesy music, the clothes, the dreams, its all 80s. Dream Warriors is definitely in the top 3 Elm street films, alongside New Nightmare and the original. It sends off the old cast while bringing in new ones and strikes a perfect balance between the eerie creepiness of the first and the over the top comedy of the latter films.Kristen is our new hero who is being haunted by Freddy. She is put in a mental hospital after she refuses to sleep and is looked after by Larry Fishburne from The Matrix. She is joined by a cast off really troubled but really great and interesting teens who all go on to be... Dream Warriors! with the help of Nancy and Donald Thompson.The film is a joy to look at, the effects, the different ways they accomplished everything is really interesting. The different dream sequences are above anything else in the original, not better necessarily, but definitely more effects heavy. Freddy as clay animation, The puppet master dream where veins are used as strings, its all very creative and very enjoyable.The cast is all really strong here, you can tell they truly care about the film their making, especially Heather Langenkamp and John Saxon who arguably had their best roles in the original Nightmare. Its a slasher where the characters actually get to fight back in their own way and the ending is sure to tug a few heart strings.Freddy has some of his best lines here, he's still cunning, he's still creepy but by god he is hilarious at points. 'Welcome To Primetime, Bitch' has to be one of the best improvised lines in film history.Overall, problems are few and far between here, I love it for different reasons than the Original and New Nightmare but it is a damn good movie and maybe the most entertaining of the original Nightmare movies.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
176,jmhammerstein-980-842586,great movie,10,10 February 2015,"This is a great movie. The best of the series. Great parts are the first Freddy part, the Freddy in the mirror part, the girl becoming a skeleton part, the line where that guy says someone cut off their own eyelids to stay awake part, the puppet death part, the tongue-tied part, the spiked wheelchair part, the talking severed head part, the crying faces on Freddy's chest and belly part, the Freddy skeleton part, and the part where Freddy disguises himself as Nancy's dead dad then kills her part. The Freddy Krueger movies are fantastic horror movies and deserve awards. Of the 8 movies with Freddy Kreuger as a major character, which are A Nightmare On Elm Street, A Nightmare On Elm Street part 2: Freddy's Revenge, A Nightmare On Elm Street part 3: Dream Warriors, A Nightmare On Elm Street part 4: The Dream Master, A Nightmare On Elm Street part 5: The Dream Child, Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, Freddy vs Jason, and a remake of the original with the same name, part 3 is the best. The rest are really good too. Don't believe any reviews that say any of these movies aren't good. Trust me. They're great! Freddy is an absurdly evil character and uses people's life situations to kill them while making wise-cracks. See this! See all of them!",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
177,NpMoviez,Last decent movie from the original line of movies.,8,29 April 2021,"This film totally respects the original film, the things which are essential to remember in this fictional universe and with that, a bit more campier and less creepier. This might put some people down, but it works for me. The two tones of the film mesh together and do not have a tonal inconsistency. The characters are more likable than in the first film. If there's something I like in any movie in this franchise more than the ones in the first film, that would be characters in this film. They certainly didn't make a better film, but did a good job in writing the characters. In particular, Kincaid, Kristen and Max. It was great to see Lawrence Fishburne in one of his earliest works. He was good but has improved a lot more in the last 30+ years.First, they did the right thing bringing back Heather Langenkamp to reprise her role as Nancy to have at least some sort of continuity from the first film and more than that I loved how they didn't acknowledge the second film at all. And her performance was much, much and much better than that from the first film. Her dynamics with each of the kids in the Westin Hospital was very good. And for the first time in the franchise, we got to see a character (Dr. Gordon) who wants to help the kids who get nightmares, even though he doesn't really know what they are going through. In the end, it does help us to feel for these characters. There are some disturbing kills in this film. Especially, the puppet kill and the ""welcome to prime time"" electrocution.I also loved the way they used Lt. Thompson in this film. He isn't there for a stupid cameo, he still has the same characterization as that from the first film, and does support a part of this story very good. Also, Dr. Thompson is given a very good character arc and a good character development. His chemistry with Nancy was also very good. It won't be false to say I liked something about each of the characters. This felt like a weird crossover of A Nightmare on Elm Steet and Disney fantasies.I must say that this movie captures the creepiness of Krueger very well, though he was a lot more goof than before. Except in some small parts, his presence was felt throughout the film. Also, we get some more backstory on the sickening origins of Freddy Krueger, which made me want to see his origin story on screen even more.It has the fantasy elements like those from Disney films, I mean those ""Abra Ka Dabra"" type of stupidity. That makes the movie goofier than it should've been. It doesn't really make us feel like there are two different films going on, and these fantasy stuffs feel like a good relief from the torments of Freddy Krueger. And the ways to give us and the characters a false hope to be superior to Freddy. This was a good idea for this film, but these ideas were what slowly made Freddy a clown in the subsequent films. So, I am a little mixed about these.And, the thing with Amanda Krueger. I don't know how popular it was then, but right from the get go, we know that the nun was a dead person, and it was obvious that she was Freddy's mother. And their decision to kill off Nancy in the movie made sense but seeing the latter films fail gradually, I feel she should've stayed. That could have made the films more connected while I don't know what other good that might have done, but there could've been something.As per the movie, Freddy isn't dead. This makes the entire film pointless. This time, it wasn't something that Nancy did in the first part. This time, it was a solid and legit defeat of Freddy. Still he is resurrected. With no explanations, that is. Again, if you are to follow what was as per the script initially, the lights in the house glow indicating that it was Nancy guarding Gordon in his dreams. So, that makes the surreal resurrection in the next movie insanely stupid. It has been addressed in Final Nightmare, fine. But that movie definitely wasn't planned when this film came out. So, I believe it was just a cash grab.It was a well directed film. I loved every single line delivered by Kincaid. He was my favorite character in this film. The parts written by Craven and Wagner, and the ones written by Darabont and Russell were distinguishable. But still, they meshed well together very well giving a good film. I don't say it is as good as the first one, but it is good.Rating : 8/10, Grade : A-",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

This time, the kids try to control their dreams and to become powerful in them, fighting with the demon, who is killing them. But Freddy is very sinister and hard to beat...

183,timefreezer7,Perhaps the best of the saga,8,5 June 2001,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** OK the first one had a good and reliable lead actress Heather Langenkab as Nancy . It also had surrealistic and twillight zone -ish dream scenes so it is regarded as a classic . But I believe that part 3 is the best of the bunch because we have a whole group of kids so we see a massive terror , ,more dramatic instead of focusing to one character . The psychological horror backlashes here to give its place to action scenes. Dream Warriors is based on a kind of horror carnival feel with a bit added colour . It could have been a failure like part 4  ,but it did not since it had reliable characters who share not only their common nightmare but their own personal demon : the drag addiction , the sleepwalking torturing etc . What 's the story ? The 7 last kids of Elm Street are patients in a mental asylum after the sleep disorders they have had . Noone believes when they say that they are stalked by the infamous dream demon with the burned face and the knife-nailed glove. The main lead is Kristen (Patricia Arquette) who is the last to join the team . The basic supervising doctor is Neil who really finds this situation a dead end especially when Freddy Krueger starts murdering the children in gorey SFX sequences . Enter Nancy Tompson from the first film . 6 years after she barely escaped she has arrived to the scene to help the poor kids as a dream psychologist , with her valuable experience . The return of Nancy as a central character is very powerful and Arqutte has such a dynamic appearance to the point you can 't decide which one is the protagonist . The old generation meets the new one. A very clever idea was the new direction the series made : the method of dream manipulation . Kristen has the special gift of bringing other people in her dreams when in danger . So the patients start massive hypnosis in order to lure the monster and trap him . The SFX are cool and Charles Russell proves himself a gifted director with a dark vision . The acting is good from all the actors but the two leads steal the show . Freddy is less scary and starts to act like a teasing Gremlin. The dramatic element is inherent not only for the children but for Nancy 's father as well . The continuation of revelations from #1 and #2 goes on with information about the background of Krueger 's family history . The movie is very suspenseful with the team spirit plot and quite dramatic . Also Krueger is killed in a very logical manner so it definately is on the peak of the series . They should have stopped right here but the producers could not resist in milking the cow to the bone. The trilogy is self dependant and should have stopped here

184,Khwaj,Brilliant!,8,14 March 2002,"Impressive, stylish and very suspenseful.This movie was certainly one of the best, more grittier and gothic. The only slight flaw to this though was the idea of making Robert Englund's character of Freddy Krueger a comedian with short wise cracks before disposing his victims.It was very rewarding to see Wes Craven offering his writing expertise since the downfall of Part 2 (""sorry, what Part II?""). The lead performances of both Heather Langenkamp and Patricia Arquette are very convincing and well crafted (hence, the relationship developing between the two).Who could've dreamt a more scarier backdrop then that of a mental ward for a bunch of labeled suicidal teenagers all sharing the same nightmare? It was also nice seeing the likes of John Saxon again. This truly should've been the sequel to the first. 8/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
185,The Bronson Fan,"""Sorry kid! I don't believe in fairy tales!"" A great Nightmare movie!",10,14 March 2005,"The third installment of the popular Elm Street series is a great one and maybe the most entertaining of the series. 3 may or may not pick up where 2 left off. The characters from 2 are never mentioned and since 2 was not welcomed warmly by the Elm Street crowd it may be likely that they acted as if two had not happened. So viewing one you can go straight 3 and not miss anything, though 2 is one of the funniest movies you will ever see. Now a girl, Kristen Parker (Arquette) is being tormented by Freddy in her nightmares. Slitting her wrist she is put into a mental hospital where all the young patients have something in common ..... Krueger has been stalking them too. Soon Nancy (Langenkamp) from part one returns, but is now an assistant who is working on groundbreaking studies in dreams. Dr. Gordon is skeptical but has to deal with her. Kristen pulls her into her dreams and finds out that she was once stalked by Freddy. As the kids get knocked off one by one, Nancy brings them together and talks Kristen into bringing them all into her dream. In their dreams they are able to now poses powers that they only dreamed of. ""In my dreams I am the Wizard Master."" Pure Cheese! To funny! Freddy breaks up the party and captures Joey. Nancy and Gordon are fired, but have to rescue the kids from Freddy. Dr. Gordon having talked with a ""nun"" finds that Freddy was the ""son of a hundred maniacs"" and that he must rest in peace if he is to be defeated. They track down Nancy's dad (John Saxon) so they can find the bones and bury him. Nancy takes the kids into the dreams to get Joey and find Krueger while Gordon her dad find dem bones. The battle ensues in the dreams some of the kids are killed, some in rather funny situations. ""Sorry kid! I don't believe in fairy tales!"" Freddy's bones come to life and kill Nancy's dad but the Dr. Manages to pour holy water on him and defeat him. Not before Nancy is killed.A Nightmare On Elm Street 3 is probably the best one to watch in the series. Part one may have better writing, but this one is great to watch with more action and better special effects. Freddy as a large worm and a puppet doll are great. This is also began Freddy's great one liners before he iced a person. Plenty of funny ones some that can't be mentioned here. Probably the best idea of the movie was bring back Langenkamp to play Nancy again and link here with the kids. Saxon is appreciated as well. Arquette is awesome and cute, it's to bad she didn't come back for part 4, but who could blame her? Special appearance by Dick Cavett and Zsa Zsa Gabor are funny, but are there for no reason. The story roles along with no boredom and great kills to boot. Especially the kid being played as a puppet by Freddy and with out a doubt when the lame ""Wizard Master"" getting his. Hahahah what a dork. For fans of heavy metal, me being one, the soundtrack is great. Dokken did the entire movie. Dream Warriors and Into The Fire are among their best songs.

189,forrestwrs,The Victims Are Bogus Characters,5,12 September 2010,"Though I thought Dream Warriors was infinitely better than the previous Elm Street movie, Freddy's Revenge, I still could not bring myself to fully like the film by the time it was over.The main problem I had with A Nightmare On Elm Street 3 is the same problem I've been having with slasher films since the first slasher film I can remember seeing: the victims are bogus characters. I really didn't like them very much at all. Granted, there was a little more depth to them than in other films, but they were still run-of-the-mill characters that I, frankly, get tired of seeing.And the acting wasn't much to watch either. Heather Langenkamp thankfully returns as Nancy, the Final Girl from the original film. But her character really hasn't gone very far from the last time the audience saw her, so though her genuine performance was appreciated, her character's presence was a little lame. There just really wasn't a whole lot to her.The film takes place in a psychiatric ward, a complete turnaround from the house that was used for the first two movies. Actually, this film feels more like a continuation of Nightmare than Freddy's Revenge did, even though Freddy's Revenge took place entirely in the same house and Dream Warriors did not. Anyway, the psychiatric ward was an interesting place to send the series, and I was ultimately happy with that change. But the characters in the ward didn't do a whole lot to establish themselves. Again, they were all very basic and didn't have too many personality traits.Something interesting that this film does is expand on its title: Dream Warriors. When the characters go into the dreams, they each have their own ""dream powers"" to fight Freddy with. They don't really make sense, and you would think the characters would be able to pretty much do anything they want in the dream if that was the direction the filmmakers were going to take, but no dice. And the whole deal with battling Freddy in the dreams did get really cheesy and really silly really fast.And then there were the puns. I hate movie puns (i.e., ""It's the chair for you, kid!"" ""Feeling tongue-tied?""), mostly because NO ONE TALKS LIKE THAT! No one starts throwing out puns when they're really mad at someone. It's stupid, it's annoying, and they're not funny or clever. So what are they trying to be? The effects in this movie were clever, though. I have to give the film that. They weren't brilliant, but they were pretty interesting. But they couldn't distract me from some of the really bad dialogue and acting. But, still, all of that was better than the predecessor. I don't put much stock in Dream Warriors. It gives us new ideas, which I appreciated, but gave them to us in a very familiar way.But I will give this to the movie: this is the first Freddy Krueger movie I have seen when I didn't completely hate the ending.5/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
190,HOPSQUIAT,Kincaid is my hero!,8,11 October 2020,"This movie is easily the best Nightmare on Elm street sequel. In fact, it is very close to the original in my opinion. It builds on the mythology of Freddy, it opens up the world, its very scary, and Freddy comes into his own as a character. He has one liners, but he's still scary at this point in the series.As far as the plot, Nancy returns to help kids in an asylum become dream warriors and defeat Freddy. I thought he was only on Elmstreet, but....who cares. I guess every town has an Elm Street.....................This movie is also innovative and well made. The set pieces are amazing. When he makes the kid a puppet..My goodness, it still makes my stomach churn. Uggggh, it is nasty, but so cool. The characters are great. Patricia Arquette, you could kind of tell that she was going to become a star. She is a powerhouse. Its great to see Nancy back and all of the characters are unique. Kincaid is my hero! I loved him in this movie. He is funny, but you can see the pain in his performance as well.Definitely see this movie. It is amazing.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
191,howellgirl2011,Nancy's last battle with Krueger!,8,13 January 2011,"I liked this movie a lot because it is Nancy's last battle with Krueger. The idea was that the last of the Elm Street kids were at Westin Hills institution due to some suicide attempts(trying to keep awake and escape their nightmare)when Kristen comes goes there(Krueger nearly had her) and sings the Nightmare rhyme(1,2 Freddys coming for you...)when Nancy comes in. She tells the rest of the children there about Freddy Krueger and her battle with him and tells them that they are the last of the Elm street kids. She trains them using their dream powers to fight Freddy in case if something happens to her. But when one of them is captured and held by Krueger, Nancy joins up with the rest of the Elm street kids to fight against him, but unfortunately Krueger tricks Nancy into thinking he is her father(he killed him while her father was trying to bury Freddy's remains)and kills her, but just before she dies she stabs him with his own glove(holy water is sprayed on him, and a cross is over his head) and then Freddy dies again. I hated that Nancy died in this film but she can always come back in another film. Overall a great film, I am a major Fred Head fan.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
192,sn319,One of the Better Horror Sequels Ever Made,7,13 December 2014,"With a somewhat intelligent plot, some amazing special effects, its own theme song, and some good actors, Dream Warriors sees the remaining kids of Elm Street banding together in a hospital setting to battle and defeat Freddy Kreuger. This movie is barely horror, more like an action/thriller. It focuses a lot more on the human characters working to defeat Freddy rather than Freddy stalking the protagonist. So as a film, it feels solid even outside of a slasher series (which I barely want to call this film. It may have the villain of a slasher, but it's like saying Hellraiser is a slasher film...it's hard to justify when there's an insistence not on murder in mundane settings but special effects and plot).There are some great, cheesy special effects that really help add a creepy air to the film.If you haven't checked this one out yet, I'd suggest you do, even if you're not into slasher films or horror movies the effects and horror won't be quite as effective to a modern audience and serves much better as entertainment.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
193,HorrorFreak1997,the best sequel of the franchise,9,31 August 2016,"a nightmare on elm street 3 is a film that manages to solidify its villain as a memorable anti hero/icon. the original nightmare on elm street was an excellent film in terms of scaring the living hell out of audiences with a truly demonic villain. this film on the other hand takes its source material and stays true to it while at the same time opening up a new direction for the character. the comedic one liners add a really nice touch to a series that could have easily grown tiresome after a few sequels. the comedy isn't exactly straight comedy but is black comedy which works very well for the character of Freddy. his character still remains scary in terms of how devilish and evil he truly is and the creative ways in which he chooses to kill the teens of the film. mostly using their fears, past experiences and lifestyles against them. very creative and entertaining to watch. this is an important aspect to keep in mind when trying to understand what makes this film as well as the original work so well. the acting is by no means great but the cast does do a solid job. I don't really have very many complaints in the acting department, john saxton returns and gives us a good performance. heather langdenkamp (I believe that's how you spell it) returns as well and gives a decent performance. here and there some of her dialogue seems a little forced and unnatural but I think she did a good job in the grand scheme of things. the rest of the cast all do well in their roles, they are after all just teenagers and aren't meant to be the most complex characters in the first place. and last but not least Robert England of course does an amazing and captivating job as Freddy. the script is honestly great! the concept of the characters all having a dream power to fight back against Freddy is interesting. it did feel slightly rushed but I don't think it really affects the film. what we get is good and I can't complain about that. we also get a bit of backstory on Freddy and his birth which is welcome, it adds to the mythos of the character and I think it makes him that much more of a dark character. chuck Russell does an excellent job directing. his way of bringing the dream sequences to the screen is great and I found myself and still find myself thoroughly entertained. it isn't world class direction like say the likes of fincher or Hitchcock but it does the script justice and is not in any way bad directing. the gore and special effects all look so good, you can tell the effects team put a lot of heart and effort in, it definitely showed. I am to this day still wowed by the effects and wish more horror films from the modern age would use practical and organic effects like the ones used in this film. all in all the film is truly great, not only is it a good slasher film, and a good sequel but it really is a great film in general. I would recommend it to anybody who likes a good time or horror films. 9.5/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
194,very_doubtful,Wes Craven brought back the quality to the series,8,31 March 2000,"Dream Warriors is a very good sequel indeed. Everything got better compared to Part 2. It doesn't repeat the mistakes of #2 like bringing Freddy to daylight. It is obvious that Craven was involved with this one. The story is not a repetition of the predecessors but adds new ideas to the series.Freddy is again very sadistic (although he was a little too comical for my taste) and he uses the fears of the teenagers to torture them. It has more spooky scenes than Freddy's Revenge and the plot has no holes or weak points this time.Heather Langenkamp and John Saxon appear in this one and give the film a connection to the original. The fact that there was Freddy's Revenge is completely ignored in this film and personally I think this is the right thing to do. Beside Langenkamp and Saxon there are other good (young) actors and actresses with Patricia Arquette being the key to defeat Freddy Krueger.In addition there are some excellent special effects, good dialogues and the characters are not as one-dimensional as in most of the other films of the series.Overall one of the three best Nightmare-films.My rating: 8/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
195,Horror_Metal,My favorite Freddy film!,10,4 October 2013,"Kristen Parker (Patricia Arquette) is a troubled teen whose dreams are haunted by the evil Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund), the ghost of a serial killer who was burned to death by the angry parents of his young victims. If Freddy kills someone in their dreams, they die in real life. After several of these horrific nightmares, Kristen is taken to a local mental hospital where she meets other teens who are tormented by Freddy at night when they go to sleep. Among these troubled young men and women are Kincaid (Ken Sagoes), Joey (Rodney Eastman), Taryn (Jennifer Rubin), Will (Ira Heiden), and a few others. The teens are visited by Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp), the main character from the first film, who is now a psychiatrist who specializes in dream therapy. Nancy is the only one who believes the poor kids as she went through the exact same thing three years ago when Freddy killed all her friends. She discovers that Kristen has the power to pull other people into her dreams, a gift she decides they all must use to their advantage. Nancy, with the help of Dr. Neil Gordon (Craig Wasson), then guides the teens and trains them to use their special dream powers against Freddy. These ""dream warriors"" may actually have what it takes to defeat the wicked nightmare demon for good and send him to hell where he belongs.This is one of my favorite movies of all time! I know I'll get lots of crap for this, but I actually like it better than the first movie! Don't get me wrong, the original is far scarier, darker, and more sophisticated but I'm afraid I would have to pick this sequel over it by a hair. There were things in the first film that never got explained and made no sense at all not to mention the ridiculously stupid ending. This movie is just way more entertaining and enjoyable to watch, with some great characters. It's great to see Heather Langenkamp return as Nancy and Robert Englund gives what is without a doubt his best performance as Freddy. This is the first movie in which Mr. Krueger is no longer dark and scary but hasn't exactly become a completely goofy comedian yet, like in later films. I love how his voice changes from quiet and sinister to deep and demonic throughout the movie. My favorite part of this film has to be when Freddy takes possession of his own charred skeleton in the real world and then buries someone alive. That scene had some great special effects! What else can I say about this movie? Well just watch it and find out why it's a magnificent entry to the Nightmare on Elm Street series!",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

197,ShadySovereign,"The best ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" sequel",9,2 January 2006,"""A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors"" is the best ""Nightmare"" sequel of all of the rest. It really explains nearly everything about Freddy, including bits of his background information.The special effects were pretty good for its time, and also alittle freaky. Freddy's makeup was almost as good as in the first film, and there is a great look at Freddy's hellish dream world.The actors & actresses were good, too. I particularly liked Patricia Arquette's performance as the troubled teenage patient at the mental ward. Fans of the first ""Nightmare"" film will love to see Heather Langencamp's return to this movie. John Saxon also returns, but has a smaller role than from the first movie.Best of all, there is no mention about the awful second ""Nightmare"" movie. I am very glad that the filmmakers of this movie didn't put in any reference to the 2nd movie (other than Freddy himself). That means this movie truly sticks to the first film's rules and ideology, and remained true to the first movie.That being said, this is the best ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" sequel. Although not as good as the original, this sequel makes use of referring to the first movie and not the messed-up second movie.I give this movie an 9/10.P.S: Look out for the sexy Stacy Alden in this movie!",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

This movie is creepy, but not scary like the first. It's more just-for-fun than it is scary, but it is a good movie. The effects are, once again, great. There are dozens of crazy battles, monsters, and dreamworlds. The acting is decent too. It was nice to see (SPOILER)Nancy(END SPOILER) back again, and the others do a good job too. The script (thankfully) is much better than Part two's. There are some pretty cheesy moments in the dream sequences, but that's about as far as it goes. The rest of the script is decent, and the plot flows well. So I would recommend this movie for fans of the original. In all it is a fun and very cool movie.

Through Nancy, they learn of Freddy's past and realise that they are the last of the original Elm Street children.Kristen and Nancy bond instantly when Nancy catches Kristen reciting Freddy's jump-rope rhyme (One, two, Freddy's coming for you). One night after Kristen pulls Nancy into one of her dreams, Nancy (who was able to pull objects out her dreams in the first movie) comes up with a plan to discover each of her patient's dream power and work together in order to defeat Freddy for good.Of course, her plan sounds absurd to the other doctors at the hospital and must convince fellow psychiatrist, Neil to take part. Fortunately, a mysterious nun who seems to know a lot about Freddy's origins is there to help her convince him. Dream Warriors was the turning point for the Elm Street series in which the movies stopped being straight forward 'horror' movies and become more like dark fantasy movies. It isn't very scary, but it is very enjoyable.I like that they took an element from the original movie, in which Nancy was able to retrieve objects from her dreams, and expanded upon it.I also like the hospital setting as it gives the movie a clinical, isolated feel as very little of the story takes place outside it.And there's that song.

203,iSkyWalKing,A.N.O.E.S. III - Dream Warriors,6,29 August 2016,"A.N.O.E.S. III Dream Warriors is a truer sequel to the original in my opinion. Some of the original cast returns as well. Of course it does not live up to the original Night on Elm St. but is a better effort considering how disappointing the second installment was. The second film felt rushed and pointless, obviously trying to bank off the success of the original as it was released just the following year. This film came out two years after the second installment so perhaps that extra year in between releases paid off, as this had an overall better flow and pacing with an interesting enough concept. But this film sort of started the trend within the franchise of overblown effects and over the top death scenes, to the point where it comes off comical more often than not. And the last act is anti-climactic and silly as in the previous film. This is also when Freddy first starts to show subtle signs of becoming a parody of himself as was the case as the franchise progressed.Overall better than the second but still very average compared to first.Pros:much darker atmosphere than the previous film with actual elements of horrorFreddy again looks pretty creepy in this like the previous film (one of the only high points of part 2)a young Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) appears in thisties into the original much better than part 2 maybe because Freddy stays within his realm, a truer sequel Cons:too many effects can lead to silly looking situations at timesstandard 80's horror flick sub par to poor acting from mostfinal act leaves a lot to be desiredSoundtrack: 8/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

With Chuck Russell directing and killer music by Dokken, expect no trouble from this comeback.Kristen(Patricia Arquette) been having dreams about a certain house on Elm Street and a disfigured man named FREDDY KRUEGER(Robert Englund).

The special effects are amazing for it's budget and year it took place in. To me FREDDY is my favorite horror villain of all time.

207,ryannemetz,DOKKEN rocks the soundtrack,10,4 February 2005,"There is no argument that this picture was the best sequel in the series. Chuck (Eraser) Russell sits in the directors chair and he gets assistance on the script by Wes Craven, Frank (Shawshank Redempiton) Darabont and Bruce Wagner. For the third installment, Freddy preys upon a group of dysfunctional teens who are all at a psychiatric ward. There, Freddy haunts these teens in their dreams. The kids then turn to help from previous survivor of the original Nancy (Heather Lagenkamp) Thompkins. Nancy, along with doctor Neil (Craig Wasson) Gordon show a genuine interest in helping these kids battle the evil Fred Kreuger. Dr. Gordon's character is really played by a believable Craig Wasson. This guy had me in awe the entire way throughout the movie. Nightmare 3 sets the precedent with all the Freddy humor and one-liners that follow throughout the series. It was something that was first implemented on this picture and it continued on with Freddy in the future killing sprees. There are also some real good fatalities on this picture, none of which I am about to spoil for you folks. Above all, Dokken cranks out the gem of ""Dream Warriors."" This song still blows me away each and every time I hear it. George Lynch, who is the guitarist for Dokken, along with Jeff (bassist) Pilson, collaborated to write this song. And while all of Lynche's guitar solos are awesome, his work on ""Dream Warriors"" is particularly searing. Along with ""Dream Warriors,"" Dokken also adds ""Into the Fire"" on the soundtrack. This song is played while Patricia Arquette is building the paper house house in the beginning of the film. Arquette's mother yells at her to turn down that music or else she'll wake the entire neighborhood. Such a statement deserves the penalty of death. ""Hey, where do you keep the bourbon?"" Although ""Into the Fire"" was not originally composed for the Dream Warriors picture, this song can still crank with the best of 80's rock. For those that are interested, ""Into the Fire"" can be found on the ""Tooth and Nail"" album. All in all, this is one of the BEST horror films to emerge from the 80's horror genre. I'd surely put it on my top 10 list for the all the reasons I mentioned. Go and check it out, and if it's not for you too bad! 10/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
208,troutman,Watchable sequel,6,15 January 2000,"I think this is where the series went down hill. The special effects (which aren't that special) starting taking over the story and Freddy starts making with the crap jokes.The first film was a classic, though today looks cheaper than the Blair Witch Project and the second one was reasonable though it has no reason for existing as there is no story. This film which brings back Heather Lankenkamp (who acts Robert Englund off the screen every scene they are in, which is not exactly difficult)who though one of the better actors in this film is still pretty wooden.However the film is entertaining enough and contains just enough horror to offset the lousy ""comedy"" (something parts 4-6 never managed). This should have finished the series but there was still money to be made.Watch parts 1-3 and New Nightmare, if your really bored watch parts 4&5, but under NO circumstances put yourself through the hell of watching Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare!!!",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
209,kenvandenbussche-2,Arguably the greatest horror sequel ever made ...,7,30 October 2007,"More often than not, making a sequel to a successful horror film ends up in tragedy. The word sequel got a bad name for itself by the huge amount of stupid and overly pointless horror films that were made to cash in on the success of the first film. But every now and then: a sequel is made that does in fact give the impression of being an original and enjoyable movie rather than a blunt and tiresome duplicate. For the ""Halloween""-series, the best sequels are ""Halloween II"" and ""H20"". For the ""Friday the 13th""-series, there is probably only one descent sequel and that's the first one namely ""Friday the 13th part 2"". And of all ""Freddy Krueger""-films, the best sequel is without a doubt this film over here: ""A nightmare on Elm Street 3"".Seeing as how the second Freddy Krueger-film was a pretty bad movie, the third one had to be a good one again in order to keep this otherwise unique series from dying off. To do that, inventor and director of the first film Wes Craven wrote a captivating story and also served as an executive producer on this movie. Whether its his influence and array of fresh ideas or the thrilling camera-work by director Chuck Russell (most famous for making movies like ""The mask"" and ""Eraser""), the third Freddy Krueger-movie isn't just a good sequel ... it's also a great horror movie!The story forgets about the second film since it added nothing new or interesting. And that's why it picks up right where we left off in the first film. Freddy's main opponent and sole survivor Nancy Thompson returns to help out a couple of troubled youngsters at a psychiatric institution who are all having the same horrible nightmares as she once did. Nancy has become a psychiatrist specializing in dream therapy and this knowledge combined with her background will certainly do a lot of good to these teens, but of course other doctors are reluctant and want to stick to their more traditional approaches. One doctor in particular will eventually start thinking outside the box and follow through.Even though this movie is good, it is however slightly different from the first one. Freddy Krueger has started uttering funny one-liners in this movie which, unfortunately so, makes him a little more of a clown than a demon. Not to worry though, because the man with the hat and the claws is still quite terrifying. The murders are also much more inventive and elaborate than ever before. The special effects have improved and the manner in which they want to destroy Freddy for all eternity is by far the most plausible one. The big twist at the end of the movie is sad but satisfying.Virtually all characters in this movie are very entertaining to watch mainly because you get to know all of them pretty well. What's also very good is the acting. Heather Langenkamp and John Saxon both return from the first movie and pick up their characters again. Both have already gotten used to playing these and it shows. Heather looks really beautiful in this movie. The friendly doctor is played by Craig Wasson. He is not really a well-known actor, but his performance in this movie is really good. Then there's also Laurence Fishburne who is certainly most famous for playing Morpheus in the ""Matrix""-movies. He plays the part of Max the janitor; a character who is bound by the rules of the hospital but definitely cares about the patients. Patricia Arquette plays the role of Kristen Parker; the most gifted of all plagued teenagers. Her acting is good. And naturally: Robert Englund steals the show as Freddy Krueger! His performance is once again spot-on!In short: ""A nightmare on Elm Street 3"" is easily the best of all Freddy Krueger-sequels! Everything feels absolutely right about this movie! There are many colorful characters to be had as well as brutal yet fun-to-watch death sequences and most of all: there is a story which guides all of this to its spectacular ending! For all I know, this great movie may very well be even better than the first one!",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

It set a premise to a great concept and a fascinating premise for a villain.. And I can perfectly understand that you'd WANT to make a sequel to the original movie.. because leaving the first movie somehow left mysteries behind and you'd want to dive into the universe to find out more about it.. The problem about the rest of the series is that they just don't work in my opinion. Elements do, but as a whole: Nope. I felt number 2 kind of had a good idea, trying to follow up the original movie.. It was OK, the point and plot was there. It just wasn't as good of a movie as the original, but a nice try at least. A mediocre sequel, but with some highlights even though. This third installation here is a whole other story. It starts off well though, presenting us Patricia Arquette in an early role... an insomniac girl not daring to sleep, but does and has a nightmare about Freddy(good scene), going crazy and is then being put into a mental-constitution where a lot of kids seems to have the same problem with Freddy occurring in their nightmare. So far so good actually!Then its _straight_ downhill though. Steep downhill! For some reason they resurrect Nancy from the first movie and she becomes some sort of squadleader and makes some kind of dream-team to kill Freddy in their collective dream. The silly thing is how its done though. The acting is not convincing, and nobody makes any sense. It turns into some sort of adventure movie... and the clichés boils over with the kids high fiving each other all the time and learning to use ""special powers"" in their dreams to defeat Freddy together. Ugh. Few things are more embarrassing. Of course they overuse Freddy as well, too. He's not scary anymore, he's just mean and sadistic without any reason. He has some quite good moments though, as the TV-movie comment and such. Still, this is the point where the series already seems to have run out of gas. One thing that can be deemed a s good thing is that they in this movie reveal more about Freddy's past.. and to one point that is a good thing.. but then there's some serious plot holes that kind of ruins it as well. It makes no sense that when they find the real burnt body of Freddy Kreuger in reality and it suddenly becomes alive and is even murderous? Huh? Everything about this movie was just so stupid when added together. Elements was quite good, but they just drowns in the misery of the wholeness. So, if you are ever going to watch Nightmare On Elm Street and haven't already.. See number 1 and try not to see the others.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
211,Dellamorte_Dellamore07,"Not only a cool sequel, but a really good movie as well!",8,12 March 2008,"A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors(1987) Director: Chuck Russell (The Blob remake)***1/2outof****ReviewArguably considered the best of the entire series (excluding one), Dream Warriors takes the series into a more fantasy oriented extravaganza. It's loaded with bigger budget, more characters, more of everything actually. The Nightmare series was on the brink of its multi-.million dollar fame and before Freddy got watered down and basically shifted into his comedian phase we had this movie. The movie has no seemingly apparent interest in part 2 and could easily be the 2 of the series since it expands from 1's origins and never once mentions the events in 2. So this could actually be the REAL sequel to 1, I think 2 was to ahead of the mythology of the series and should have been made after Dream Child (5 in the series). The plot focuses on the remaining ""Elm Street"" children all rounded up in the local mental hospital, where the skeptical staff tends to them. It seems Freddy has been alive and kicking and has been still terrorizing dreams. The movie opens with one of the children Kristen (Patricia Arquette) trying desperately to stay awake (by spooning down coffee mix) and making models of the house she's been dreaming of. Well efforts aside, she has a dream and we are basically thrown into a much different approach then the proceeded. The movie is bombarded with SFX, the Elm street house is pimped up to one spooky setting, and the first stalk sequence is a good example of what's instore for the audience. Anyway, after barely getting killed by the Fredster, Kristen joins her fellow survivors in the asylum where quite conveniently joined up by part one's heroine Nancy. She is now a dream doctor (or something) and once realizing what the kids are up against she embarks them on a mission to fight back. It is discovered that Kristen also has a gift of pulling in people to her consciousnessin order for everyone to dream the same dream. Alas, when doing this Nancy is able to have every dreamer obtain a certain power, which they use to battle Freddy. That is basically the premise as the last half of the movie is a series of event showing some do battle and fail, and some warriors team up to use their efforts while the only kind doctor tries to bury the bones of Freddy in order to stop his reign of terror.I admit I saw this movie at a young age, and doing so I easily invested a lot into the well rounded group of troubled teens. We have the easily likable Kristen, the uber cool tough Chick Taryn (Jennifer Rubin), the endearing mute guy Joey, the sympathetic chubby girl in hopes of seeking fame, the nerdy (but cool) War craft/fantasy obsessed Will(who looks like Waldo from Where's Waldo), and the bad ass Kincaid (who more or less spends most of the movie yelling), I'm missing some of the others but you get the idea. Ebert said in his review that he felt the movie gave him no sympathy for the characters and that was its biggest flaw, well I take that in stride. I had no trouble and it actually hurt when some of the kids died. Having that investment surly made the movie a much more personnel viewing. I cared. The movie also runs rampant with SFX, imagination, cool visuals, slick audio and some whacked out death scenes (with a bitter cruel streak). So many of the movies scenes stick out for me, the Freddy snake, the Freddy puppet, the Freddy TV., the Freddy needle scene, the hallway of mirrors, Freddy's basement and boiler room scenes, the Freddy demise. Any video game fanatic would appreciate the action that goes down (dreamers using skills to combat Freddy), and the mythology laid down in this entry certainly is very video game like. The mythology of Freddy is also more sketched out this time as we learn more of his origins and also discover what happens to the souls of the kids he kills (they are trapped in his chest and appear as a tormented screaming face).It seems the more souls Freddy obtains, the stronger he gets. Angelo Badalmenti (Mullholland Drive, Twin Peaks) is the composer this time around brings one of the most unique scores of the entire series. It's quirky and quite pleasing to the ears. I want it. It brings a touch of class to the movie and compliments the imagery quite nicely. The directing is quite inspiring (considering it's his first movie) and he succeeds in balancing the cheesy jokes with the movies menacing sense of hopelessness almost effortlessly. You can tell the makers must have had a blast with this. I know I would have. The movie has a hopeless and nihilistic vibe that makes the jokes more passable. Some flaws that I have to mention is that the warriors aren't never fully able to use their skills towards the end, whether this was time restraints, money, or intentional it's never clear, but it seems they could have had a bigger fight with Freddy, also after Freddy's eventual demise the movie basically ends to quickly, since I was 98% invested with the characters, I wanted to know the outcomes of all the survivors. It didn't happen, making the last frame somewhat tedious. All in all though, I consider this movie to be quite bad ass, and can proudly hold it's head up as not only a worthy sequel, but a highly entertainment movie in general. This is the sequel I show to unfamiliar Elm Street fans, and on that note dare I say we have a ""classic"" on our hands? I do.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
212,Shaithis,Wes Craven and Heather Langenkamp Come Back For The Attack.,10,11 January 2000,"I never thought of Wes Craven as the god of horror directing.  You could have fooled me though when I saw the difference between Nightmares I, II, and III!  Nightmare I of course was the original concept, II being some shoddy remake/sequel of the first (not made by Craven), and III is well basically a classic!Dream Warriors came out at the time when Heavy Metal music was popular to mix in with horror movies (i.e. Trick or Treat, Friday The Thirteenth, etc.).  The song Dream Warriors by Dokken became a hit and pushed the film in the theatres (the film helped Dokken's sales too), even though it wasn't really showcased in the movie much.  Nancy returns as a dream specialist (clever don't you think?) and runs into the Elm Street children.  Events begin occurring that look too familiar to her and she vows to help them.  The key part to this story is that each child has their own power in their dreams.  One is a Magician, another super strong and it goes from there.  Using all their skills combined together they try to fight Freddy...the Dream Warriors.Patricia Arquette, yet another unknown actress (remember Johnny Depp in Nightmare I?), is brilliant in her role.  Her power in the film makes her the most important child in the film.Freddy is at his best in this picture.  By now his fright has waned because of all the one-liners we have heard in the previous Nightmare film.  Unlike future films though, the balance of comedic relief and horror is never broken.  It fits like a glove!My favorite in this series, the music, actors, and story will always be a classic to me.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

At this point, Freddy has just begun his turn from boogeyman to second rate lounge comedian, but he's still sinister enough to supply a few scares.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

Unlike Nightmare on Elm Street 2, which deviated from a lot of what made the original so great, Dream Warriors goes back to it's roots. Heather Langenkamp reprises her role and is a welcome addition. There are a smattering of other teenagers cast with very apparent stereotypes as well.A few great/gory moments, much better special effects than Nightmare 2, and a plot that...well, let's just say it was ok. Freddy is also a bit more entertaining, and really seems to show a little more of his dark character. It's a solid sequel, I'll just leave it at that.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
215,horrorflicklover,"The best Nightmare sequel, hands down.",9,17 November 2014,"Truth be told, the Nightmare series would have done well to end as a trilogy. We would have gotten two great films, and one mediocre film (part 2) which at least had potential, and was decently thrilling and interesting. Nightmare 3 was almost perfect, aside from perhaps a TOO comedic tone in certain areas, and some CLEAR camp aspects which otherwise blotch up an outstanding entry to the series.With that, I can't lie. There's times you'll be watching this, and thinking: ""God, could it get MORE 80's cheesy?"" Unfortunately, Nightmare 3 dates itself in that regard. However, even with its flaws, it's still a good entry, and definitely worth a viewing.Nightmare 3 is the direct sequel to the Nancy Thompson storyline, as Nightmare 2 isn't connected to that plot at all (it only alludes to it). Nightmare 3 continued the development of Freddy Krueger in more than one way. Not only did we get more of his backstory, we also got a broader expansion on a key part of his character development: The bogeyman terrorizing an entire town. Nightmare 2 didn't really do either of these things, it only (briefly) retold the events and backstory of the first film. While it was focused on Freddy's terror, it was more centralized to the main characters. Nightmare 3 began to show the effects that Freddy was having on an entire town worth of children, and with that, it connected Nancy Thompson to this next series of victims admirably.It was no longer a small group of friends coping with the bogeyman of their nightmares, now it was strangers having to come together. Strangers who could never get the adults in charge to understand that it wasn't just suicidal teenage melancholy, the terror was real. Freddy started to really reach out his razor claws and touch the whole of the population. And all it took was a few of these adults to believe in them before they could make progress. The film really moved the series forward in a respectable way, and that's the key part of why it's a must-see.Freddy establishes a respectable body count in part 3, with more creative and interesting deaths as well. This is honestly both good and bad. Good in the sense that they are fun, and prove that Freddy personalizes his power based on whoever he is killing. Bad in that as the series chugged on, the deaths just got very silly. There's nothing wrong with a wisecracking Freddy, it's the incarnation of the character that we've all grown to know and love. However, moving the series in to that direction really hurt it, in my opinion. It made it much easier for bad writers to cheese out the remaining films in the series. Although, that's just another reason why I feel that Nightmare on Elm Street should have ended as as trilogy. It was a funny Freddy done well. He still presents an actual air of terror without turning completely in to a cartoon character.So laugh at a few cheesy scenes, a few thin points of dialog, what have you. Overall, you'll agree that this was the best Nightmare film since the first one. Unfortunately, it's the only one (aside from a couple of spin-offs) that was really any good. But good it was. Nightmare 2 may have had a darker Freddy, but Nightmare 3 was a better film by far.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

What a load of dribble...By reading the reviews by the fans of the Elm St series this film is supposedly better than the second. People even say on here it's the best in the series. I have to disagree. This film doesn't even touch on the first. I've just watched the film for my first time and I have to say it was so boring I struggled to sit through it. I said to myself I wouldn't bother writing a review but the film bored me so much it must have spun me into some kind of perpetual state of boredom, making me become boring myself and come on to write about how bored the film made me feel and probably bore you that is reading. I guess you can call this a horror film, yes, but it does not scare, not for one second. This is a teenage fantasy film, and this film is prime reason why franchises are bad.

There are many exciting scenes, for example the TV-scene, the bathroom scene or the scene when they try to find Freddy's oddments. But compared to the first Nightmare on Elm Street movie there is not much new. Freddy Krueger tries to kill adolescents while they are sleeping. This time the movie plays in a mental hospital for adolescents, which all have nightmares and are persecuted by Freddy in their dreams. As in ""One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest"" the nurse does not listen to her patients which is one positive element of the movie and criticizes society.

220,steelcorpfilms,This should have been number two.,8,3 September 2001,"I would say this is what `Nightmare 2' should have been.  It picks up where the first one left off, although 6 years later, and it further explores Freddy's character as well as the dream world.  If a sequel is going to be made, this is the way it should be done.  It brings back Nancy and her father from the first one, and it also brought back Wes Craven as co-writer and executive producer.I most likely always like movies that take place in mental institutions and stuff, which this movie does.  Also, like the first one, the characters are real characters not chumps you'd just as soon see dead and that helps the movie a lot.  I'm assuming that might have been Craven's work but don't hold me to that cause I don't know for sure.  The acting was once again up to speed, and there were even two up and coming stars (Patricia Arquette and Larry Fishburne) that had excellent parts and played them really well.
You can tell that New Line was putting more into the series by the number and quality of the special effects.  This movie had tons of really good effects from a barking pig's head to a giant Freddy-snake thing (which looks a lot like a male reproductive organ if you look at it).  There was one effect that was downright horrible, though, that involved a `Jason and the Argonauts'-like skeleton fighting with real actors.  Let's just say at least `Army of Darkness' had better effects than this or else the movie would have been ruined.Ah, Robert Englund, he really must like this part.  I don't blame him; it probably is one that comes around once in a lifetime.  He really sinks his teeth into playing Freddy Krueger and by the looks of it he enjoys it, too. This was the movie where Freddy got the reputation of being a wise-cracker (`Welcome to prime time, bitch!' Need I say more?), but I think it fits him. It sets Freddy apart from the more silent and slow paced killers (i.e. Michael and Jason).Great sequel and a great installment in the `Nightmare' series.  You could skip the second one and not miss much but you should definitely check this one out.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
221,utslitt,A Nightmare on Cheese Street,6,15 July 2019,"I'm a huge fan of the NOES films due to the amazing practical effects, imagery, concept, and of course, the star of the films, Englund, as well as how vividly he brings life to Freddy. When I heard about Dream Warriors, I had to see it. Even more so when I noticed Heather Langenkamp in the cast.Our setting of the film is the ""snake pit"", and that's actually quite fitting when you think about it. Children having absurd, yet realistic dreams about a homicidal maniac who wants to kill them which winds up affecting their lives more than likely would be in a nuthouse - so again - the setting fits, and it's genuinely appreciated that we're exploring this element of the story. No one believes anyone behind white walls, so all the children really have is each other. Each other, and well... Nancy.What disappointed me about this film was the irony of the name. How are you going to call the movie ""Dream Warriors"" and hype up these children as some sort of kick-ass superpower having, Freddy destroyers when they're picked off one by one just like they would be in any other NOES movie? Literally everyone who used their ""power"" (and I use that word as loosely as possible) died. Oh, and secondly, what the hell kind of power is jumping?Either way, at the end of the day, this movie is actually one of the more interesting, clever sequels out of the NOES films. To say it's one of the better ones out of the franchise as a whole, eh... you'd be pushing it. Freddy is just as sarcastic as ever, provides us a plethora of juicy, creative death scenes, and keeps the film moving along with just the right amount of nail-biting tension.It's worth a watch, but leave all your expectations at the door, and take it for what it is.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
222,Jonny-ironica,"My favorite in the series, definitely the best sequel.",9,19 April 2016,"By the time I was 10, I'd seen all of the series up to that point(born in 1989, Freddy VS Jason had yet to come out by then). Part 3, Dream Warriors, became an immediate favorite as I had a childlike fascination with the idea that a group of kids could be heroes with superpowers in their dreams. And while that fascination has died down, my love for this movie has not changed.Boasting a well-rounded cast and a return of Heroine Nancy from the first film, this sequel captured Freddy at his best. A blend between the scary, looming figure with a perverse humor and the wise- cracking, one-liner Freddy of later entries. Here, it wasn't tiresome. As funny as the ""Welcome to prime time, B----!"" line is, being strung up like a puppet by veins and muscles is terrifying. There's also something troubled teens can connect with: the suicide theme(which had more prominence in Craven's original script). The idea that you could be murdered by someone and have everyone who loves you think you committed suicide is horrifying in my mind.The atmosphere of the sets, the lighting, and the score while they're dreaming were very well done and essentially, this is one of the most original supernatural slashers in existence. I know many people complain that this is where Freddy took a turn for the worse(though I really think it's part 4 where he lost the chill factor with his stalking, manipulation, and kills), but this is the high point in the series for me.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
223,Frankaub-1,One of the best horror movie in my opinion,8,2 August 2019,I'm a huge fan of this franchise but this is the one I enjoy the most watching time to time. Freddy is very funny and the kill are awsome.

Bringing Nancy back makes this film eminently more watchable than number 2 and the introduction of Kristen (played with energy by the beautiful Patrica Arquette) was also a fine idea.  Add to this solid direction from Chuck Russell and scripting by Shawshank Redemption's Frank Darabont and you've got an exciting and thoroughly enjoyable movie.   This is the first one were Freddy cracks wise as it were, and while that added alot to the sequels it also caused a great problem.  None of the sequels are really funny enough to be comedy or scary enough to be horror. Still this one balances the two paradigms nicely and also has quite a strong storyline.   Its good to see early stuff from Patricia Arquette and Laurence(Larry!) Fishburne.  The characters in this are well thought up and you do care about them, especially the mute Joey and tough-guy Kincaid.

Heather Langenkamp is back even though she is miscast as the youngest psychiatrist on earth, it feels like we are in a good place it's sheer relief limited acting abilities or not; the identity in the series is found once again.The dreams sequences are utilized to full effect again, the death scenes are inventive (The head through the TV screen a favorite) and that's thanks to the great effects. Angelo Badalamenti is on board as composer and as thus the score is infinetly better than the previous two outings.Dream Warriors provides some fleshed out background to Freddy Krueger and it's as nasty as it should be, Krueger wasn't yet a pun machine but still he produced a couple of zingers here, To Zsa Zsa Gabor on TV as she dribbles on - ""Who gives a fuck what you think?"" a highlight. The finale as cheesy as some of it is, is really fun - it loses its tone of fear in the last 3rd unfortunately.

226,Phrankster163,Eighties horror at it's best,8,9 May 2006,"From the time NOES came out to the making of NOES 3 horror had started to change. Jason had hit his peak in Part 4, the TCM sequels had been horrible and Michael Myers had been gone for 7 years. In their place we had movies like Hellraiser, the Lost boys and the House movies. Horror was changing from brutal to supernatural, and New Line decided to add Freddy to that trend as well. So they filled in the blanks of the story by having these kids getting dream powers, so they had a chance to fight Freddy (why no one ever uses dream powers again in the rest of the series remains a mystery). This is the best of the sequels (along with New Nightmare) in my opinion. The cast is the best they had in the series at all, counting great actors and actresses like Larry Fishbourne and a very young Patricia Arquette. The effects are high-class for the time and the deaths we're both inventive and fit the characters perfectly.

They lend credibility to this sequel that was lacking in Part 2.  Revealing more of the backstory of Freddy Krueger is also a nice touch.  This one also contains, in my opinion, the most frightening nightmare of them all: the kid who is led puppet-style to his death by his veins and tendons.Unfortunately, this movie also contains the series' penchant for terrible acting.  The special effects are nice, and you can tell that they were starting to put some money into the production of these movies, but it still doesn't eclipse the original in terms of quality.Still, this is a good entry in the series, and obviously enough people liked it to warrant producing a few more.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
228,du_man,"Not a good film per se, but fairly entertaining and imaginative.",8,3 May 2006,"Six years after the original Nightmare, Nancy (Heather Langenkamp), now a psychologist, finds that the kids at her workplace are having Freddy (Robert Englund) visit them in their dreams. For a little variation, one of the kids (Patricia Arquette) has a strange ability to bring other people into her dreams. Dreams containing spectacular special effects and imagination --- but not enough.Wes Craven returned to the series as a co-writer, but direction was given to Chuck Russell. This is both a good thing and a bad thing. Good thing: Russell has one heck of an imagination, and, in spite of a minuscule five million dollar budget, he got the special effects people to put some great visions on screen in a freaky fashion that's convincing in a comic-bookish way, which is right for the film. Bad thing: Russell has no idea how to direct actors to give good dramatic performances or stage scenes where people actually talk to one another.Now, at this point in time, Craven's writing was a little weak dramatically, but that was okay when he directed, because he knew how to make it look good. Russell, however, was new at the whole directing thing, and the dramatic scenes are pretty darn stiff. And the actors don't help. Langenkamp isn't a bad actress, but she's very inconsistent here. In the dream sequences, she's fine, but outside of them, she's a little wooden. Sadly, she out-acts most of the rest of the cast. They all have energy and seem to be putting a little effort into it, but very few actors in this film do anything memorable. Craig Wasson, as another psychologist, is okay but kind of dull. The rest of the teen-agers are one-dimensional at best. Not all of them are bad. Of course, Robert Englund is wonderful as Freddy. John Saxon plays his return about right. And Laurence Fishburne is completely real and convincing. He plays the role with conviction and believability. It's too bad he's only in the film for about five minutes.But the acting isn't the real problem. None of it is bad enough to wreck or even seriously hurt the film. In spite of my complaining, the actors are at least adequate for what's needed. You don't really want any of them to die or anything. The problem is split between the writers (Craven, Russell, Frank Darabont in his pre-Shawshank days, and Bruce Wagner) and director Russell. Now Craven's basic story is good. In fact, it's a really good story that manages to be both a clever and fairly logical way to continue to series. Also, the decision to pretend Part 2 never happened was an excellent idea.However, even though Craven made up a good story, Russell throws his wild imagination into the script, and the writer of the Shawshank freaking Redemption was involved, the script is fairly predictable and two-dimensional in spite of some great ideas. And, as I said, Russell is lost when someone isn't having a nightmare or hallucination or anything like that.But then there are the nightmare scenes, some of which border on brilliant, all of which are pretty darn cool. The one with Freddy turning into a giant snake and slowly eating his prey is pretty intense, and most of the others are quite memorable (such as the guy puppeteer-ed with his own blood vessels, the Wizardmaster or whatever he was, the guy tied to a bed with cut off tongues, and the TV that comes to life very literally). The dreams aren't really scary, but they are atmospheric and freaky. And lots of fun to watch. They don't quite cross the line into truly great sequences, but they're pretty darn good.And for the most part, the special effects work. They aren't totally convincing in a literal sense, but in the context of the film, they work just fine. The skeleton at the end is the only truly failed effect.But good special effects aren't enough to rescue the film. It's still an obvious and wooden horror film that isn't scary. And yet, for some reason, I liked it anyway.It took me a while, but I finally figured out why. The answer is the same answer to many of the flaws in the film: Chuck Russell. The atmosphere and energy and imagination of the film all combine to make it work on a B-rate comic book level. In fact, on that level, it works superbly.So, in the end, I guess I had a lot of fun watching the movie. I just had to keep reminding myself to turn my brain off. I probably should have done that in the first place, but I was hoping for an intelligent horror film. Go into this film with the right expectations and you'll love it. Just realize it isn't going to work on the same levels that the original (as well as Wes Craven's New Nightmare) worked.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
229,mlwitvliet,It's not an complete waste of time,4,9 October 2010,"I saw this movie years ago and was very annoyed by it. Then I came at IMDb where I read the comments on NOES 2. A lot of people thought it was bad, but I actually thought it was OK. The main reason that most people didn't like the second movie was Jessie, who seems to have a sexuality problem. I didn't have a problem with it. What the movie did was extend Freddy's power which could be ""logic"" because Jessie was so very afraid of Freddie.The power of Freddie in part one (and which made NOES 1 an instant Classic) was that he was ""real"", and that made him so scary. He brought you so deep in your nightmare that it became real and is that not exactly why we are scared of nightmares. That they seem so real??? The second movie went on on that same line but this time, as said Freddie used Jessie. But still AFTER dreams. He had Jessie in his grip and he wasn't strong enough to fight him. That's why I liked the second movie also.But OK, a lot of people thought the third movie is THE sequel at the first so I gave it a try again and I still disagree. It goes way further down the line then the second. The story-line is OK. It goes further into the legend, I liked the plot of the Non and Nancy returned in the movie, Nothing wrong with that. But why is she suddenly so tame and hasn't she got the power to fight Freddie again. and when I saw Freddie appear as the snake again, I immediately remembered why I dislike this movie. What the hell is that??? Why does Freddie suddenly has to appear as a snake like were watching a fairytale. And then the Puppet Death! The scene was great till the end as Freddie appears as a giant and snaps the lines with a stupid grin on his face. That's where Freddie lost his strength for me an became a laughing joke.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

I like how it took place in a mental hospital and how the use of dreams came back into the storyline. Although the dream power theme is something more reminiscent of Spiderman or other cartoon teams, I enjoyed it just the same.  Some of the lines in this from Freddy were great and appropriate for the scene and then other lines from other characters definitely needed some polishing.  I love the tv scene, the faucet fixtures from hell and the puppet scene.  This is definitely one of the best nightmare on Elm Streets.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

It just creepy and dark enough to have some scares. But also started introducing the comedy that would actually become too overused in later sequels. Probably the best kills in the series.,A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

GREAT FILM!!!",10,21 May 2017,"SUCH A GREAT FILM, I love this film more than the first 2, it's a fantastic film about taking control of your own dreams. These Characters go from being terrified of Freddy to standing up for themselves and attacking that dirty S.O.B! Using their own powers to fight against him, However like always, Freddy finds out what hurts most and uses it against them, lurking one to her death as this girl walks over to the TV and tries to fix it when all of a sudden Freddy pops out and kills her and before the kill he states ""Welcome to Prime Time bitch."" Before smashing her face into the TV. It's great and I don't want to ruin anything here, so PLEASE go see this film, it's the best in the series and is one to remember. 10/10 GO SEE IT, it's a film I list as a (Must see before you die) Even if you're not a horror fan.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
234,housecountrywife,Best of the Series,9,8 August 2012,"the A Nightmare on Elm Street series is by far my least favorite of the original 70's and 80's horror franchise (compared to Friday the 13th, Halloween, Amityville Horror, etc). The original film took me a couple of times to appreciate (Yes, I am surprisingly a fan of the remake over the original, though Robert Englund will always look better as Freddy...yes I was even surprised myself when it hit me).So that being said, in my opinion ANoEM 3: Dream Warriors is the best the series has to offer besides the original (and New Nightmare, though that isn't apart of the same name franchise).It has Patricia Arquette (darling she is) and Laurence Fishburne in this film, two strong actors who never fail to deliver their parts in a realistic or at least well played fashion (something not present in a lot of the sequels IMO). Also the kill scenes are quite innovative for the time, a few times the movie tricked me as well with the dream sequences. If you are interested in the series, this one should not disappoint you.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
235,Quetzl,best sequel,7,30 June 1999,"Easily the best of the innumerable sequels in the series. Decent script, plot, and some surprisingly good performances (Patrica Arquette!) round out a good film. My only complaint is that it is pretty predictable.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
236,imnotjohncandy,Ain't Gonna Dream No More.,9,7 September 2021,"Since I already have already talked about the first two Elm Street installments I think it's time I talked about the third..and the most infamous one of all Dream Warriors, oh hell yes. This is when Freddy Fever officially kicked off and when Freddy officially became a household name. The dream demon is back and this time he's going after a new group of teens, but these aren't ordinary teens...these are teens who have powers/skills they normally don't have in their dreams. Ladies and gentlemen, meet the Dream Warriors. Each of them has an unique power/ability in the dream realm which comes in useful, such as Joey's super sonic scream, Taryn's needles/knives, Roland's super-strength, Kristen's ability to pull people into her dreams, and Will's magic. Also this movie was banned in Australia for some reason, well one particular scene was...the scene where Taryn dies via Freddy's needle-claws.The kills are very creative and some of the best Freddy deaths I have ever seen in the entire franchise, including the ever memorable scene where Jennifer dozes off in front of the tv while watching a Dick Cavett interview only for Cavett to turn into Freddy and Freddy to emerge from the television uttering his famous line...'Welcome to prime-time, bitch', this definitely is the second time i've seen someone being killed via a television, okay...the third if you count Videodrome, the other one being in Grosse Pointe Blank. Does this mean that Groccer from Grosse Pointe Blank could be her father or even her uncle? Because they both die the exact same way.I love the puppet sequence too, that's creative and has great use of stopmotion/claymation. Also it's really inventive of Freddy to use Phillip's interest in puppetry as a means to destroy him in the dream world. I also really like Joey's kill in this.... Freddy appears as a sexy nurse and seduces him only to use his freakishly long tongue to pin him down to the bed. Freddy would later kill Joey in Dream Master by appearing as a sexy woman in a waterbed. Makes me wonder if Freddy would ever consider doing that type of kill often. And you can't forget Dokken's epic Dream Warriors song. And oh yeah, the freaking Freddy snake scene..the Freddy snake.If you haven't seen this installment of the Elm Street franchise, you should..and if you don't Elm Street, don't worry you will. But if you haven't heard of it, don't worry...Freddy is going to be coming for you too, so I wouldn't bother falling asleep.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

240,DamRho,The best of the sequels,8,8 January 2003,"How unfair can a movie rating be? If you looked at these scores you would never guess that Dream Warriors is the best movie of the Nightmare On Elm Street series. Although Freddy's Revenge, the second installment on the series, was a bit lame, Dream Warriors actually take Freddy's saga to a next level. Plotwise, this movie is also of extreme importance as it starts to unravel a few of Freddy's background and the emerging of his arch-enemy, Nancy. The legacy left from this movie is also noteworthy. Films like Scream have obviously taken their inspiration from Dream Warriors' plot. If you are a fan of the Nightmare On Elm Street series then this movie is a must. If you are looking for a thrill, or just tired of failed Screams sequels, watch this movie and you won't regret it.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
241,hprobert-84928,The best of the 'Nightmare' sequels,8,9 March 2020,"'A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors' is often held on high regard as being one of the best in the franchise, and it is easy to see why.It continues Nancy's story from the original, whilst also introducing a new set of characters who are surprisingly likeable. It also introduces the idea of people having powers within their dreams which is a great concept and was surprised that it wasn't explored sooner. This one is also where the series starts to get more humorous, however it is not over the top here and overall the film rarely feels humorous.Freddy also takes numerous forms within the dreams which was also a cool new idea, from a giant worm to a little Freddy puppet which is something that the later sequels went a bit overboard with.Overall, a surprisingly good sequel and is a shame the sequels went downhill after this one.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
242,Rise2Glory,A good watch,5,26 September 2001,This movie is pretty good.  I would bet that when this one came out that many wanted to see it.  Mainly because they wanted Freddy and the Nightmare creators to redeem themselves after that extremely bad Freddy's Revenge.  I know I was hoping for a little redemption.  Even though this one was far superior to Elm Street 2 this missed the mark of the first one.  Freddy became more of a clown than a boogeyman.Grade...5,A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
243,JP_Shay,Creepy and Atmospheric With Freddy Krueger at His Absolute Best!,9,26 December 2016,"As a horror fanatic and huge fan of the ""Elm Street"" franchise, I honestly think Dream Warriors is one of the greatest sequels of all- time. It has everything - great atmosphere, fun characters and Freddy Krueger at his absolute best!!! The story takes place in a mental institution and the patients' dreams while the line between reality and dreamland is blurred and we are not always sure which one we are in. Freddy himself is used sparingly, which I believe was a good idea since he is so effective when he does appear. The cinematography is brilliant and along with the haunting score creates such a nightmarish atmosphere that feels genuinely scary. I was always impressed with how dreamlike the film can be at times. The special effects were done especially well when it came to the gore and dream sequences. The part where Freddy comes out of the ground as a giant snake-like creature and starts swallowing the girl whole looked freaky as hell! But one of the most memorable scenes has to be where the guy is used as a puppet and sleepwalks to his death. All of the sets looked great and helped create much of the film's haunting feel. The cast did very well also, especially Patricia Arquette in the lead role. Heather Langenkamp returns as Nancy from the first film and even if her acting is sub-par, her presence helps bridge a connection to the original Nightmare On Elm Street film. Of course, the true star has to be Robert Englund, who is really the only man who should ever play Freddy Krueger. He brings a wicked sense of humor to the role and provides much of the films comic relief without losing the scary. This is an accomplishment in itself since most horror- comedies tend to lean more towards the comedy side no matter how hard they try. What makes ""Dream Warriors"" great is that it doesn't have to try. It knows what it is and has all the necessary ingredients to succeed. This is a great standalone horror movie and should not go overlooked by fans of the original Elm Street film.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
244,Mike-646,I liked it,8,10 April 1999,"I really liked this movie.  It was scary, cheesy, and Freddy had some funny lines in it, although I hear that they get worse along the line of freddy movies.  I've only seen two movies in the elm street series, and they are the first one and the 3rd.  Those are supposed to be the best along with ""New Nightmare"" but my video store doesn't have that one.  They don't have freddy's dead either.  If anyone wants to tell me which is the next best in the series, I'd appreciate it.  I don't want to waste my money on a movie that sucks.

246,MistAh_Justus,Turning Point in the Series!,9,12 August 2009,"This movie was definitely a turning point in the series. Wes Craven really took advantage of the whole whole dream demon concept. This is the entry that stepped it up a notch when it came to creativity which resulted in a really entertaining movie. The nightmares are more intense as anything is possible in this one, Freddy does a lot more then just jump out at you here. Plus, we ignore the events which took place in part II (good idea) and we get to see a familiar face as Heather Langenkamp returns as Nancy Thompson. With the return of Nancy and Wes, this movie really feels like something special.In this entry, we follow the story of Kristen Parker (Patricia Arquette, who does an excellent job alongside Langenkamp) who is placed in to a psychiatric institution after slicing her wrists, but really we know it was Freddy doing it by making the taps of a bathroom sink come to life in a dream (pretty intense nightmare actually). Once in the hospital, we meet a bunch of other kids who all share similar dreams of FREDDY! It's a really good idea and setup for things to come. Also, Wes brings back Nancy by having her accept a position as a research scientist at the same psychiatric institution. Now with everything set in place, it's time for Freddy to cause some havoc.Immediately we see Freddy begin picking off the kids one by one. We see him go after Kristen first as a snake like monster in a nightmare. Luckily, she pulls Nancy into her dream to help before she is completely swallowed. This ability to pull people into dreams was another great addition to the film/series. One of my favorite kills of the series comes shortly after, as Freddy goes after a kid named Phillip Anderson (Bradley Gregg) who is known for his sleepwalking. While asleep, Freddy jumps off the wall as a puppet, which was pretty neat, and becomes himself while standing in front of Phillip's bed. I know I'd freak out if I woke up to him just standing there. Once noticing Freddy's there, Freddy begins cutting him up, and using his bloody veins to control him as a marionette, which leads to Freddy cutting the strings and Phillip falling to his death and making it look like a suicide. Easily of the most creative and gruesome deaths in the series and it looked fantastic.Another creative kill is when Jennifer (Penelope Sudrow playing another patient), the girl who wants to be the movie star and burns her own owns to stay awake, falls asleep while watching TV. The TV goes fuzzy and as she tried to change the channel, the TV grows arms and Freddy's head busts out picking her up and smashing her head through the screen while delivering the line: ""Welcome to Primetime Bitch!"". Pure awesomeness, but with this being said, allow me to introduce to you, the new and improved...Comedian Freddy, well maybe not yet, but like I said already it was a turning point, for the character and the series.The effects used in this film are great for the most part, the snake bit and puppet death both look fantastic, but there are some choppy bits as well, like when The head doctor at the institution Dr. Neil Gordon (Craig Wasson) teams up with Nancy's father Lt. Donald Thompson (John Saxon) to properly bury Freddy's human remains, but are confronted by his skeleton (ugh @ that scene).Throughout the film, we are shown more and more what can be done with dreams, as the teen patients all find out they have their own dream powers, as they team up to become Dream Warriors! This really helps build up to the final showdown as they all must use their dream powers in stopping Freddy. The 'death' of Freddy is much more epic in this film compared to the one before, as it's a combination of taking him on from the dream world and reality. Unfortunately, while making it more epic, we also see the death of Nancy as Freddy imitates her father and finally takes her out. I must say it did work well though, with Nancy passing the torch on to Kristen...for now.Dreams Warriors has one of the best casts in the series, if not the best. We get a younger Patricia Arquette and Laurence Fishburne both putting in good performances and Robert Englund back again as our burned up maniac. Also I really like the tag team combination of Joseph 'Joey' Crusel (Rodney Eastman, playing a mute until he finds his voice) and Roland Kincaid (Ken Sagoes, playing a smack talking strong man with some pretty funny lines).In conclusion, this is a fantastic sequel that could have easily worked as a conclusion to the series since everything seemed to wrap up fairly well. We see an equal amount of comedy/scares from Freddy, unfortunately for the last time before the comedy takes over. This entry is easily my second favorite in the series, but when comparing it to the original, I just can't give it that 10, but a much deserved 9.5...9.5/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

First at all, Patricia Arquette is wonderful even at 17, she is perfect in her role of the poor little crazy girl chased by an awful and terrible killer. The story is really good and we learn who is freddy (even if the 4 is better for the origins) and who is her mother. (oh my god) Nancy returns (she was so good in the first one) and is now a kind of doctor who helps the kids in a psychiatric hospital.

254,kingmattress,Incredibly Scary,9,5 April 2004,"I'll start by saying that I'm not easily scared by horror movies.  Very rarely do they scare me in the slightest, but I love them.  I'm either enjoying seeing kills in original ways or looking for one that may scare me. This movie is the only movie in history to scare the bejesus out of me.The movie focuses, of course, on Freddy Krueger, a madman who terrorizes and kills teenagers in their dreams.  He can control every little detail of the dreams, making him nearly invincible.  Freddy is easily one of the best horror movie villains ever; he even ranked all the way up at #51 on some magazine's 100 Greatest Movie Characters.  He's scary, he's got an awesome weapon, great one liners, and is truly a maniac.The movie takes place six years after the original.  Nightmare 2 took place a year before this, and wasn't great.  For Nightmare 3, they continue almost directly from the first one's story.  Teenagers start attempting suicide, with dreams of Freddy being their common link.  These teens are all checked into a mental asylum, where their doctors are clueless.  Then these teenagers start dying in their sleep.  Hope comes in the form of Nancy Thompson, the hero of the first movie returning as a dream analyst.  She knows Freddy all too well, and he recognizes her as well.  With help from Kristin, a girl with the gift to pull people into her dreams, Nancy leads a group of teens into a final battle with her old foe.I think this is the best movie in the series.  It's the scariest by far, as there are more and less predictable deaths.  The first death scene is one of the scariest and most disturbing you'll ever see.  Robert Englund really plays around with the Freddy character, making him more maniacal and terrifying than ever before.  It's also the darkest movie in a very dark series.  Several of the deaths are shockers, and the locations are grimier and creepier.  It was sadly, the last scary movie in the series, though I found them all entertaining enough.  But if you're a horror fan, give this a try.  And if you scoff at this being ""unscary,"" think about your dreams, and how many similar dreams you've had.  We've all dreamed we're falling.  Not everyone wakes up.  One character proves that.  Finally, if that's not enough for you skeptics, these movies were based on true events.Sweet Dreams.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
255,tixsr-6000,Cheesy kids adventure movie,3,30 August 2014,"This movie starts the 80's child version of Ghostbusters or a some comic book hero team like kid Avengers in the A Nightmare On Elm Street series which is repeated also next sequels. I guess I've should known that from title(Dream Warriors...) which is like a kids adventure movie name and the content is also that too. There's some good elements like mental institution as an environment. Characters in the movie are so cliché that its incredibly generic 80's childish adventure movie; one black bad ass, one handicap, one shy girl, one loud girl etc. And the most stupid thing, they become superheroes in their dreams. Together they try to save their lives and/or dreams from Freddy Kruger. Many bad ideas are first time in this movie and repeated in other sequels. Recasting Heather Langenkamp to this movie was not a good idea, her character is unnecessary to the story. There's also quite stupid ways to die like to be smashed into TV and bad Freddy jokes. From here it goes even worse in next the sequels, more and more bad jokes and unnecessarily brutal, long and dull ways to kill. Unfortunately Wes Craven's presence in writing the story and screenplay doesn't make this film near as good as the original ANOES.

Nancy (from the original) comes back as dream expert, and uses the power possesed by the unit's patient, 'Kirsten' to combat freddy. This is a lot better than the previous film, but nowhere near as good as the first. Imaginative deaths, Freddy is kinda cool even if a tad too funny (Naff funny!). It has an impressive cast, bar one (see below)If you are wondering why in the title i put 'Should Have Been Called Scream', its because Kirsten (Patricia Arquette) does nothing in this film but Scream. Most of her scenes contain her screaming more than she talks, and i don't know if it's just me but it gets right on my nerves. Scream, Scream, Scream. Freddy PLEASE kill her and save my eardrums.

258,SnipChop87,One of the best sequels in the series!,9,9 March 2006,"A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors ranks right up there with the first film. Set 6 years after the first film, the ""Elm street Kids"" have been committed to a mental hospital since no one believes them about Freddy. After a new patient named Kristen (Patrica Arquette) is admitted to the ward from what appears to be a suicide attempt, we are re-introduced to the survivor of the first film, Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp). Nancy now works at the hospital as a dream therapist and knows that the kids are being tormented by Freddy. However the other doctors are skeptical, including Dr. Gordon (Craig Wasson). After several brutal deaths, Nancy finally convinces Dr. Gordon that Freddy is real and the kids are in real danger. Nancy explains to the kids who Freddy is and why he is after them and how she barely survived being killed by him several years before. Nancy also tells them that they all have a unique dream power among themselves and that if they enter the nightmare together and combine their powers, they can defeat Freddy. However, once they arrive, Freddy starts using their weaknesses against them and it looks like this is the last dream these kids will ever have.Let me just say that this is my favorite sequel in the NOES series. Apart from the first this is the scariest most creative film. The beautiful Heather Langenkamp reprises her role of Nancy and the one and only Robert Englund plays the diabolical Freddy Krueger. Although this film can drag at some points and marks the point of Freddy having one too many one-liners, I recommend this film to anyone who enjoyed the first film and likes to see movie characters die in morbid, yet creative ways.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

First of all Freddy isn´t himself anymore (see my comments on ANOE 2 for explanation). He talks too much in this movie and isn´t nearly as scary as in the first and to some extent the second movie. And there isn´t another movie in the series where we see the good ol´ Freddy that we all know and love(?). That´s really a shame, but apart from Freddy this movie has a lot going for it, the SFX are great and there are some cool death scenes (the puppet anyone?).

260,Endology_Forever,Does Not Eclipse The Original,7,18 October 2006,"After the big disappointment of Freddy's Revenge, New Line managed to lure Craven back into the franchise to give the get it back on track. Bringing Nancy back makes this film eminently more watchable than number 2 and the introduction of Kristen was also a fine idea.The setting on this occasion is some type of juvenile centre for people who are deemed as being suicidal. At this particular centre, the roommates all have one thing in common. That's right, they're all being stalked by a disfigured homicidal bastard son of a hundred maniacs. The fact that there was Freddy's Revenge is completely ignored in this film and personally I think this is the right thing to do. The film is initially slow to start but it gathers momentum leading up to an interesting finale where the kids go to battle Freddy on his home turf. They can only defeat him, however, if the bones of his body-stashed away in a secret place-are buried in hallowed ground. What follows is a fight between the kids and Freddy Krueger-on his home turf.A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 isn't the strongest entry in the series but I have viewed it several times since the 80's and it gets a thumbs up from me. Unfortunately this movie also contains the series' penchant for terrible acting. The special effects are nice, and you can tell that they were starting to put some money into the production of these movies, but it still does not eclipse the original in terms of quality.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
261,Krueger-2,My favorite sequel of the series.,10,5 June 1999,"This movie was a very great movie. Craven returns after the disappointing Nightmare 2. My favorite character returns. NANCY (Langenkamp)!!!  I also like Kristen (Arquette) but I like Kincaid (Sagoes) better than Kristen, but too bad he plays an obviously slow adult who acts like a baby in a great movie that I have seen, ROSEWOOD.  But A Nightmare 3 has good special F/X for a movie back in the eighties and for a low budget movie.  The ending was great.  I like the part when they fight Freddy towards the end.  It wasn't much of a fight, but it got the job done. I rate this movie along with the original a 10/10.  It was great you should see it if you are a true horror fan.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

264,sonofamanandawoman,Almost Better Than The Original,8,12 June 2008,"I think I was around 6 when I first saw this movie and I can remember my parents watching it with me and they actually apologized to me after it ended because of the gratuitous nudity and the vulgarity. I particularly remember the scene when Philip gets his arteries torn out and becomes Freddy's puppet as he leads him down the halls of the mental hospital. That scene still stands out in my mind today and I still grimace when I watch my DVD copy of this movie from time to time. Patricia Arquette is excellent in this film and Heather Langenkamp is very good as well. It was pointed out in another review of this movie that each of the victims in the movie that Freddy kills have their own unique traits, and Freddy uses these to determine their nightmare atmospheres and their deaths (such as Taryn dying from Freddy giving her an overdose of drugs with multiple syringes). This is one of the things that makes the movie so good. I found that the scene where Freddy as the hot nurse seduces Joey was very amusing. The flying tongues were brilliant as well. The ending I thought wasn't the greatest but the audience needed to know there was going to be another sequel and the light coming on in the popsicle-stick Freddy house was one way to let everyone know Freddy would be back for more. I highly recommend this flick to anyone who doesn't mind bad dreams too much.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

It was watchable and as good as the first film in the beginning but from the part where the protagonists get super powers in theirs dreams, it started to become childish. This sh*t should have been rated PG or PG-13 rather than R. I expected to see some very mature stuff but it was only for the 1/3 of the film. The rest are for little kids. Plus it's focused too much on Christianity. I know Freddy's a demon but there are many religions that have different ways to fight demons. Why does it always have to be Christianity? This is total Orientalism and filled with white men/westerner's superiority. Don't' watch this, show it to little kids who loves power rangers.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

I didn't think they were gonna make another sequel that connected with the first film. Boy was i wrong this sequel ended up being the first sequel of the Nightmare series i actually enjoyed and still till this day is one of my favorite Nightmare films. Not only did Robert Englund return as Freddy Krueger but also Heather Langenkamp returned as Nancy Thompson from the first film. As well as John Saxon returned as Nancy's father Donald Thompson from the first film too. This happens to be actress Patricia Arquette sister of David Arquette of the Scream films first movie. And again like the first film this sequel had great acting and great cast. Featuring a young Laurence Fishburne who would later star as the abusive husband Ike Turner in What's Love Got To Do With It? I really enjoyed this third installment. I can watch this film over and over again and never get tired of it. I recommend that this sequel is a definitely must own like the first film for horror fans.,A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
268,tomd4ever,"1,2 Freddy's comin' for YOU...",7,17 June 2005,"This was a great movie that kept me entertained the whole way through. This is the third installment of the Nightmare on Elm St(NoES) series. The basic plot of this movie is: a child killer(Freddy Krueger), who was burnt alive by the parents of the town of Springwood comes back to get his revenge; by killing the remaining children of Springwood in their dreams. Some may think this is a stupid idea, but it made 6 sequels(with probably more to come) and 1 spin off, so Wes Craven(the original director and writer) must have done something right, because even to this day Freddy is loved and feared by many people all over the world. The amounts of scenes that didn't entertain me were slim to none.This most likely was the NoES that Freddy's comedy began. In this movie Freddy had heaps of hilarious one-liners. The kills were reasonably gruesome while still entertaining and interesting. The death scenes were quite suspenseful, and even though you thought that you knew that Freddy was going to attack his dreaming victims you were never quite sure...""Welcome to Prime Time BITCH""-Freddy Krueger-NoES 3: Dream Warriors.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

Probably the best NOES movie out there, this movie picks up where #1 left off.Nancy, now a grown woman, visits a mental hospital in order to help a new batch of teens who are being tormented by Freddy. As is true in most of these movies, the first death is the best. Philip's puppet death is probably the highlight of the movie, so if you can't get hold of the DVD, at least watch it on youtube! Sadly, this movie contains only 1 other good death, involving a head exploding. Killings were very rushed, therefore less bloody.Guys will really like this: Stacey Alden goes topless! Sadly, this is the movie in which Freddy starts spewing out crappy 1 liners. This, mixed with a nerd yelling ""I AM THE WIZARD MASTER!"" kind of makes the whole thing....... odd to say the least.I say 10/10, it kept me up all weekend!

273,iknowotudidlastsumme-1,Love the film but still not as good as number 1,9,28 December 2007,"This film ignores the elm street 2 and continues 6 years where the 1st left off. Now Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) returns as an intern for sleep patterns etc. At first she is unaware that the kids are being tormented in their dreams by the legendary Fred Kruegar, but soon she runs into Freddy in dreamland and Freddy easily recognises her and this is where the movie can become more interesting.Some downsides is this is where Freddy begins to become comedic but not to bad effect in this movie and it's not too over the top. I personally think that this film has some inventive death scenes and the puppet scene always freaks me out though i'm not quite sure why and seeing as I watch much T.V I must personally say that I think I'll give up the T.V or i just might die that way.There are quite a few memorable scenes and I honestly believe that Nancy was perfect in this movie, and the idea of dream powers was a good idea but this idea wasn't used fully or this movie could have been better but it gave the basis for what it needed to show that just because you have dream powers it doesn't mean that you have no fears and this can be shown quite well although mainly in my opinion in one scene.I believe the acting was brilliant as i have already mentioned Heather Langenkamp and others such as Petricia Arquette and John Saxon and of course the wonderful Robert Englund who portrays once again the fearsome Freddy and he does it so well that It deserves such mention as some people don't respect him in such a way and it's a shame as he is very talented.So in my words of wisdom if you've watched the 1st nightmare on elm street then should definitely watch this if you haven't already and if you haven't seen any of them then this is a great one although you may appreciate it more if you watch the 1st one before this one.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
274,ed_jamieson,"Not a great film by any means, but is vastly superior to the horrific film number 2.",4,28 December 2002,"NOES 3, penned by the now fairly famous Darabont, is perhaps one of the better entries I've seen in the series.I'm not going to suggest that in any way I really liked this film: compared to the first film, and Wes Craven's New Nightmare this comes off rather shabbily. But, compared to the atrocious Freddy's Revenge (which suggested death lay just over the horizon for the NOES franchise) this film is practically gold dust.Instead of some shabby unrelated storyline ala 2, Dream Warriors concentrates on filling in plotholes and providing background information on Krueger's origins, aa well as building on the mutual hatred, fear and yet understanding between Freddy and his nemesis. The story takes place a fair ways after the events of the first as we are introduced to a group of Elm street kids who are haunted in their dreams by the murderous Krueger, and are under treatment in a mental institution. A short ways into the film, Nancy, the heroine of the first, and now a psychiatrist, is called to the institution to treat the kids, and soon realises what they are seeing is not some illusion of the mind. Under the tutorage of Nancy, the children learn the skills necessary to fight Krueger on his own battleground: within their dreams.It's good to see Heather Langenkamp's character Nancy back, she is the strongest character of the series, as well as the focus of the first film, and it is a mystery as to why her character was not written into the second script (incidently enough, there is no reference to be seen in this film to the events of Part 2). Robert Englund, too, returns to playing Freddy as the character should be played, and though there are a few of the one liners that littered his character in many of the later films, these are rather sparse, and not too cringe worthy: Englund still comes off as scary. We also see some rather nice special effects and makeup in this film, as one comes to expect from the series (Such as Freddy's syringe glove: anyone with a fear of needles will crap themselves :) ).And yet, the film is far from without significant flaws. There is a rather abundant quantity of grotesque scenes in this film, but precious few that I found genuinely scary, as the first was. Personally, this doesn't do for me, I expect horror to be scary. Some of the acting too, is rather dud: many of the children turn in performances either over the top or bland and dull. And then, there is the return of the father figure character from the first: he turned in a bad performance in said film, and manages to usurp it in this, making in my opinion, the worst part of the piece.But hey, when looking at this film you've got to take it in context of it's competition. Certainly when compared to the abysmal 2, we can find much of value in this, and I've been told some of the later sequels are even worse (shudder....). Not, on the whole, a dreadful horror film then.And it's features Dokken singing 'Dream Warriors', a song so cheesy and over the top that it couldn't possibly be more out of place in a horror: either you'll laugh or you'll cringe.5 / 10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

You get to know a bit more about Freddy and what happened to him.This movie has horror, comedy and much more which is nice to get a bigger audience, and of course it does. As this franchise grows it kinda goes out of hand sometimes, but that's what makes it special.Overall this movie was fun to watch.

I went into it expecting nothing but greatness, but sadly left it confused as it was honestly just average at best. If this is supposed to be considered the best then the first 2 must be considered terrible. There was genuinely nothing too good about this film, in fact, it was so bland that after a while I just got bored and had to take a break from watching it. Maybe I'm just thinking narrow minded, but I just completely missed the bus with this one and don't get the hype about it.

278,mdeaston-1,Give me extra cheese with that !!!,6,8 March 2009,"I'll start by saying I am a fan of the series but this is probably the weakest of the series. This movie kind of strikes me as one of those films that could have been much better than it was. The film revolves around a group of kids in a psychiatric hospital, Nancy from the first film makes an appearance as she sees Freddy in a dream and realizes she has to protect the remaining children. Whilst there are some genuinely creepy moments (the puppet scene is brilliant) the problem with this film is that it is just plain cheesy , the idea that Freddy kills you in your dreams therefore because it is a dreamworld anything can happen is just stretched too thin, for example one of the kids turns into a wizard (complete with cloak and green fireballs), I mean this is meant to be a horror film not the black cauldron. Freddy has also become more like a game show host in this one. The characters are also very stereotypical in this film (moreso than in any other of the noes series) and some of the dialogue is pretty terrible. A real shame as this film showed potential",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

280,ctdudeuk,The second best Elm Street movie,8,5 June 2008,"As many users have said, this is one of the best entries in the franchise, and in fact I'd go as far as to say its the best after the original. While subsequent movies would find Freddy becoming cartoonish and frankly, embarrassing, 'Dream Warriors' balances the dark, tense moments with the lighter-hearted slasher style humor very well.It also has its own merits, rather than regurgitating the original story. Having a team of kids fight Freddy would be done to a much lesser effect in Freddy Vs Jason - the difference here being the kids are likable, and can actually act. You really do find yourself rooting for them.The mental-hospital idea is great, as is each of the teenager's individual traits being used in their dream sequences - i.e. the nerdy kid is a wizard and so on. If you're into the elaborate death sequences, this movie has some of the best including a creepy-as-hell Freddy mannequin and the infamous 'Welcome to primetime, bitch!' head-through-the-TV scene.In fact, one of the only disappointments in this movie is the return of Heather Langenkamp as Nancy. Don't get me wrong, she's a fine actress and its great to see her face-off against Robert Englund once more. It just seems like what should have been one of the movie's highlights is underplayed to the point of anticlimax.'Dream Warriors' isn't without its flaws, but nor is any entry in the Elm Street series.

283,vibeologyfan,Lots of Missed Opportunities,7,5 September 2001,"By the mid-1980's, horror movies were back in style.  The explosion led by ""Halloween"" (1978), ""Friday the 13th"" (1980) and the original ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" (1984) was in full blossom by the time Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) returned to the screen for the third time in 1987's ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors"".  And ""Nightmare 3"" is the second highest grossing film in the storied ""Elm Street"" series... proving that horror was indeed hip.The remaining Elm Street kids have taken residence in a local Springwood hospital, seeking help for their ""sleep disorders"".  But when survivor Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) comes on the scene, she knows who the real culprit is.  With the help of fellow doctor Neil Goldman (Craig Wasson) and teenager Kristen Parker (Patricia Arquette, ""Stigmata""), Nancy transforms the group of teens into a group of ""Dream Warriors"" and leads them into battle with Freddy on his own turf.As far as the ""Nightmare"" series goes, this entry is one of the better ones, and is a favorite among fans.  But while it does re-energize the series, it does have many flaws that fans tend to overlook.The biggest fault involves the return of series heroine Heather Langenkamp as Nancy Thompson in what is perhaps the highest point of reference to ""Dream Warriors""... but she is sorely underused here, losing the spunk and fighting spirit she inhibited in the original.  In what could have been a huge Freddy vs. Nancy rematch, she is rendered almost powerless here, and (as much as I love Heather) her wooden acting reflects that fact. (Thankfully, she redeems herself in the strong ""New Nightmare"" sequel in 1994).One of the other glaring flaws concerns the character of Freddy himself. Freddy has been accused of becoming less scary as the ""Nightmare"" series progressed, becoming less of a menacing figure he was in the original, but what most fans tend to overlook is that he became a wisecracking clown in this entry.  ""Nightmare 4"" exploited this aspect of the character to montorous proportions, but it was here in ""Dream Warriors"" where the one-liners became popular, and the special effects took center stage over the scares.This is not to say that ""Nightmare 3"" is totally without merit.  It is an exciting movie with some very innovative sequences.  But with the return of original stars (Heather Langenkamp, John Saxon and Robert Englund), and original creators (Wes Craven co-wrote the first version of this story), ""Dream Warriors"" is only a fourth of the movie it could have been.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

Very rapidly those memories disappeared until a couple of years later I plucked the courage to rent 'Dream Warriors' from my local video store, I watched it but could not follow it.But after viewing it the second time round as an adult I came to a conclusion that its second in the series only to part 1.The film from start to finish sticks to its sub-heading 'Dream Warriors' and does not go astray.Set in the fictitious Springwood town of Ohio. A bunch of secluded and misunderstood 18 year olds have fallen prey to the wrath of child killer turned dream demon Freddy Krueger. The mental/psychiatric asylum backdrop oozes out of every scene. But this time round these tormented youngsters will be more than a match for 'Freddy' who loses his dark sinister image to bogeyman who is an idiot and will be ridiculed along the way. What follows is a series of cat-and-mouse encounters between Freddy VS united teenagers/sympathetic doctors/divine intervention.The movie has some very memorable fantasy/supernatural set-pieces,decent script,crisp editing and more importantly a very-very underrated star-cast i.e. Fishburne, Langenkamp,Arquette, Wasson and a welcome return of Heather Langenkamp(Nancy).The theme of Good v Evil and fighting for a cause enhance its universal appeal. Dare I say the film has a feel good factor especially if you suffered from Insomnia while you were in your teens.Not ground-breaking like part 1 but still an excellent horror film let alone one of the best in the series.

289,LewisMorin,A wonderful entry in a not so wonderful franchise,9,29 August 2014,"A Nightmare On Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors In this film, Kristen Parker is attacked by Freddy in her dream(s). In the opening scene, upon waking up from being attacked, her mother mistakes her wounds to be that of a suicide attempt, and Kristen is sent to a mental hospital for young people located in Springwood, there she befriends the patients, Dr Gordon, and Nancy Thompson from the first film, the rest of the plot focuses on their struggle to survive and convincing the adults in the film that Freddy exists. For his directorial debut Chuck Russell does an amazing job, But this film in the series drifts away from the style that the first two films featured, instead of it being filled with suspense, it relies mostly on the amazing effects to shock the audience more so than scare them. Which in my opinion isn't really that much of a bad thing, the effects on their own might not terrify the audience, but they are handled in such a fantastic way that its still incredibly entertaining to see such amazing special effects. One aspect that is consisted with the first two films is the interesting characters, along with Kristen played by Patricia Arquette in her first film role, Dr Gordon played by Craig Wasson, Nancy Thompson returning from the first film, again played by Heather Langenkamp. What's interesting about most of these characters is the fact that even though this is a slasher film, the audience genuinely cares about them and they don't feel like cannon fodder that are only there so that they can be killed off in a creative way. Robert England delivers another great performance as Freddy Krueger, but with a lot more lines and screen time it feels distant from how we know him from the first two. Another aspect that it maintains is the amazing visuals, the production design is at its peak in this film, especially with the dream sequences. I don't have a lot of complaints about this film, the effects are great, the characters are good and the acting is good for the most part. My only complaints are that there is a bit of a lack of character devilment with a few of the characters, my other complaint is surprisingly Heather Langenkamp's performance, its good for the most part but with a few of her scenes, her performance comes across as a bit wooden and off. I was originally going to give this film a 6 out of 10, but when I watched it recently in preparation I realized its much better than I once thought, so I'm going to give A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors a 7.5 out of 10.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

So I rented it, not only because I like the concept of the NOES movies, but also to see for myself what is this movie all about.And boy, was I disappointed...It has been many years since the movie was made, so I managed to be condescending even though I believe good movies survive time.This time, and for a change we have a multi-plot storyline, where we have three main characters able to throw the story ahead, but the really one that matters, because he is the one who really solves the movie throughout is the one that never seems to interest the viewers. I'm talking of Neil Gordon (Craig Wasson), the doctor who the mysterious Nun (Krueger's mother) talks to and finally destroys Freddy Krueger's body in the end. All the rest of the characters are used to distract the audience from this story. And that's sad, because the warrior background is good material. If it's Neil who finds out how to kill Freddy and if it's him who really does it at the end, what's the importance of the other characters if not only to feed up opportunities for gore moments? Even though it never really goes anywhere with it, Nightmare 3 has a good storyline, if we stick with the wrong idea that this is really about kids who face Freddy Krueger through their powers in dreams.But if we -again - are accurate onwards the story we understand that when the characters finally know their point in the story (to confront Freddy using their powers connected as a group, to survive) and they jump into the dream to do as they think it's best, they die. They only use their powers once and lose. The first time, the wizard kid uses his powers, he dies, the first time the drug addict girl uses hers, she dies too and the others never fully use theirs against Freddy. Only Patricia Arquette completely uses her kick-boxing features at Freddy only to fall to the ground easy and if it isn't for Neil Gordon's help, they would all die.What irritates me is not the fact that the characters fail miserably when put face to face with Freddy, but the fact that this is supposed - as the title indicates - to be a story about dream warriors, so at least they could give a bit of a fight and show at least once a cohesion as a group. It never happens. So, the best idea of the movie is wasted completely upon his failure to deliver what it promises.Another annoying thing is how shallow Nancy's character has become. She seems like a doll, acting almost without expression as if she was an angel. And in fact her role is not that important in the movie if we watch it as a whole. If there was no Nancy in there, the story would go exactly where it goes, only with the five special warrior kids. So why bring back such a rich character if not to make her unforgettable in her final goodbye to the saga? The only thing she's useful for is to stall Freddy Krueger while Dr. Neil Gordon destroys the skeleton.Oh, and more... What about the rules on Nightmare movies? If there's one thing that I think about movies is that if they create rules, they can't bend them willingly without explanation. Since the first movie, the basic rule is Freddy Krueger exists only in the dreams of people, nothing more and he only has powers within that world. So how the hell can he make his skeleton come back to life if that scene doesn't take place in the dream world? Where's the explanation for that? It's lame that they never give it. They could use the whole skeleton idea which is very good in fact, but at least they could explain how it is Freddy has powers over his real-life skeleton.OK, people can refute me, try to talk back and say that this was a b movie, so it's normal that there are flaws, but I cannot accept that as an excuse. As a spectator, I want to watch a movie regardless if they spent a zillions more or not on the script or effects. It has to be logical. Especially when all of the flaws that I pointed out are storyline mistakes, and a screenwriter takes the same money if he writes good or not.But this is movie with good moments too, so it's not all about negative things for me, it has great special effects and creepy atmosphere when we are in the dream sequences. Everything within the special effects in the movie is kind of mind-blowing and overall that's what stands off in the movie (the marionette sequence, the TV eating the star wannabe or the curious penis-like Freddy Krueger eating up Patricia Arquette).This movie could have been much better if it was told with fewer characters, and that is to me, what cripples this movie. There was no need for Dr. Neil's character, Nancy could fill up his role and be more active on the storyline with no harm done to the story. And I would like pretty much to see the whole group of dream warriors fighting together as a group, and not only the small showoff scene when they go and save the mute captive. But enough is enough, for this movie stands off as a sequel better than others did (Friday The 13th, Chucky, Scream) and managing not to be a terrible movie, this Nightmare sequel has style and creativity. And that has to mean something.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors

293,hh-13366,Well done,8,18 August 2021,"Definitely an improvement over the second film, but still can't reach the heights of the original.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
294,varshae-21827,Almost as good as the original,8,19 October 2021,"This is definitely almost as good as the original film, though I will say that I wish it had been a little bit more darker and serious. It got a little to adventurous and fantastical for me.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
295,PoisonBlackV,"A Good Film, The Best Sequel",8,23 July 2008,"This movie is such a great accomplishment for the horror genre. When I put this movie on my DVD I thought to myself, ""Is this gonna be as good as I thought?"" I mean, the night before I watched Freddy's Revenge which is a film I'd give a 3.5/10 for. After one hour and a half of excellent film-making I thought wow. This delivered everything it wanted to deliver, The Scares, The Dark Humour and a piece of Awesome film-making. I watched all 7 films a year ago, summer of 2007, and to this day I still question myself this ""Is Dream Warriors better than the original?"" The original provides more scares, but Dream Warriors has a very good plot.My rating for this would be 9/10, but because this film good be better than the original, which is so rare, It deserves another point.10/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
296,HudderHawk,Excellent sequel!,8,15 September 2002,"If you've never seen the Elm Street series, what I'd do is sit down and watch Craven's classic original Elm Street and then pop this one into your VCR as it completely dismisses anything that had to do with the 2nd Elm Street (which is great!).Craven comes back to re-write what the team had destroyed in the 2nd one and produce Freddy Krueger as he should be shown. A scary, laughing madman in your dreams, in your mind, with no defence. A burnt stalker with knives for fingers, red and green sweater and a dirty brown hat. To kill the last of the Elm Street children.Heather Langenkamp returns; although not the best actress, but she is Nancy. The first one who figured out how to beat Freddy's scheme as an intern to assist teens with the terrors that live within their dreams by the name of Freddy Krueger. The other doctors think meds and isolation can beat these dreams when she knows working as a team to beat him is the answer. John Saxon also returns as the now drunkard father of Nancy.And I guess I am of course a fan of Craven and Freddy (interestingly the only Freddy movies worth watching he had a major part of, because he knew how to bring Freddy to the screen).They should have made part 3 the last in the series, but instead they felt like grabbing millions rather than leaving the death of Freddy on a believable note.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
297,The_Crimson_Idol,The best of the nightmare on elm street movies!!!,9,28 October 2003,"After seeing the original nightmare on elm street several times as well as the 3rd installment, I can safely say that this one is slightly better than the original, although many will disagree with me.  You have to appreciate and give credit where credit is due obviously to the creation of Nightmare on elm street by wes craven due to the fact that it was very cutting edge for its time and revolutionized the horror genre, great concept, but Nightmare on Elm Street 3 takes its to a whole other level by building and elaborating on the first one which I believe simply just layed the ground work.  First of all, Wes Craven wrote the third installment unlike the rest of the nightmare sequels which are all absolutely awful, thus explaining why this one picks up where part one left off bringing back the original cast of characters to once again do battle with Krueger.  This one has so much more to offer than the first in regards to the actual orgin of freddy krueger and why he is what he is.  The special effects are state of the art for the time and still hold up, the acting is superb from patricia arquette and the movie is the most entertaining from start to finish compared to the other nightmare installments, excellent and creative ways used to kill the children of elm street in this one, with a killer soundtrack by Dokken, great piece of nostalgia from the killer 80's metal era.  If youre a nightmare fan, this ones for you, see the original first, skip part 2, watch this one, and forget the ones after this one even exsist. 9 out of 10. Great!!!",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
298,oldmatthewyoung,Best Sequel in ANY Slasher Series,9,29 October 2021,"What a great take this was for a part 3, which are traditionally just money-grabbers with no real merit. Not here. Instead of the same old, lame, stereotypical teens that you only want to see get killed, this movie brings actually empowers the victims. It gives them a chance to fight back. Now, they don't all succeed and there are still plenty of gory, great kills but at least you care about these characters. AND they bring back Nancy! Frank Darabont chipped in on the writing and Chuck Russell nails it with great tone and direction. Highly recommend!",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
299,jameslechase,"Good if you like horror, Great if you love Freddy",7,8 December 2005,"I'm a big Freddy fan, always have been, always will be, so I watch his films whenever I see there on. In Dream Warriors we are introduced to the Krueger we've all come to know and love. He's still a menace, still brutal, and finally he gets to make some pretty good bad guy off the cuff remarks, (""Welcome to prime time bitch!"") that are now his trademark.The movie itself, for when it was made, how much it was made for and every other aspect you need to take into consideration is pretty good. I wasn't expecting academy award winning performances from Patricia Arquette or ""Larry"" Fishburne by any means, but I was expecting a little more than what I got, still, good for what it is.The story itself is probably the smartest idea the series has come up with, and is now all but overdone. The Dream Warriors are the last of the Elm St. kids, and they've all ended up in an insane asylum being treated for what the doctor's call a ""group psychosis."" Guess who just happens to be doing groundbreaking research in the field of psychiatry and dreaming? Heather ""Nancy Thompson"" Langenkamp. Yep, Freddy's first fling is back in the mix and she wants to train the kiddies to fight back in their dreams. Each child has a different personality, there's a stereotypical angry black youth. A dungeons and dragons type nerd in a wheel chair. The tough but confused crazy, ex-addict girl. The goody two shoes blonde that plays the part of the damsel in distress. The I want to be an actress in Hollywood girl, but I'm too chubby and not pretty enough. And of course your average everyday bad-boy with greaser haircut. Cookie Cutter stuff, I know, but it works.Each of them discovers they have a unique power in their dreams, one that they can use to fight Freddy. Yeah...The movie is formulaic and tired, but it gets the job done. I keep saying it gets the job done, or that it works, because it genuinely does. If you're a fan of the series at all you'll appreciate this. The most interesting aspect of the movie itself is the subplot between Dr. Neil Gordon (Craig Wasson) who is helped by a mysterious nun to come to terms with the existence of Freddy, and also how to destroy him. I won't say much more because I don't want to spoil anything for anyone.This film also answers some questions you may have. ""Where did Freddy come from?"" ""Why does he do what he does?"" etc. While in later installments these are expanded on, changed maybe, and easily misinterpreted, you'll enjoy the ""bastard son"" line, and the story regarding Freddy's birth.In Dream Warriors we have the first real Freddy-centric film. The kids play a big part in it, and it's supposedly uplifting, yadda yadda. Freddy really isn't on the screen that much, but everyone, and everything is revolving around his development. You can smell the creators of the series smiling at the soon to be cult icon they've created, and you feel how giddy they are that now he's got this almost lovable personality underneath all the burn damage and well, murder. I'm a Freddy guy, I am, I admit it. I think he can take out anyone in the horror world, including that retarded hockey mask wearing, machete wielding gorilla from Crystal Lake. In closing, if you're like me a devout Freddy guy who enjoys his movies no matter what, because you can't help but cheer for him, yeah, go rent it, go buy it, anything, something. Just watch it. If you don't like Freddy as much as I do, and if you kind of sort of watch horror films without much heart, go rent something like Friday the 13th part 8, it's just as funny as Dream Warriors, but for an entirely different reason. Sweet dreams everybody!",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
300,mouth101,3rd nightmare the best?,9,29 December 2004,"nightmare on elm street part 3 is easily the best film in the series! the story is fresh and exciting and the acting is shockingly good for a horror film. after freddy 3 the others just got worse, boring story lines and poor acting, freddy became a joke and his killings were nothing new or shocking. freddy verses jason is a top quality film were the horror legend got to rule again, teasing his pray before killing them and mocking them before slashing them to pieces. not only is this nightmare the best for its story-line it also has some pretty good special effects, it also gave us a glimpse of how good larry fishburne is as an actor( even if his part is small ), patricia arquette also made her film break-thru.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
301,Harvey_Birdman,Wes Craven doesn't have to be involved,6,21 October 2005,"I don't think Wes craven needs to be involved. Sure the first and last nightmares were probably the best of the series, but all of the others were good in their own little ways. Well, maybe not 2 and 5 but for the most part each movie was just as fun for me to watch as the original. The fact that the kids all have dream powers in the third movie shouldn't be thought of as stupid, but you should see that as funny. it puts a different twist on the movie and makes it something else all together. kinda like a horror/comedy. And beings that this one was successful, it opened the door for the next highest grossing of the films. The series didn't go on the down slide until 5. so all in all, the whole series was excellent and i recommend them to everyone.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors
