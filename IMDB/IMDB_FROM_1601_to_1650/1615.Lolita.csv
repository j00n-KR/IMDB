0,MartinHafer,"In many ways, very well made...but who would want to see this?",6,7 February 2008,"The only reason I finally brought myself to watch this film was because Stanley Kubrick directed it and being a cinephile, I thought I had an obligation to myself to watch it. I have to admit that the movie was extremely competently made (with one exception which I'll get to in a bit) and did keep my attention despite being a very long movie. However, and here's the problem, who exactly is the intended audience? Seeing a movie all about a pedophile just felt very, very creepy--especially since, in some ways, the film seems to rather sensitively portray this depraved man--almost making you feel sorry for him. I wonder...had Sue Lyon been a little less physically developed or if the role had been played by a boy, would people have accepted it? Life is just too short for this sort of film and I hope never to see another one like it--it just made my skin crawl at times.And, as I said above, the film was very competently made...except when it came to Peter Sellers' very bizarre and over the top roles in the film. While Sellers was great in THE MOUSE THAT ROARED and DR. STRANGELOVE in multiple roles, here it just seemed out of place and dumb. This wasn't just because of the bizarre characters he played but because in the role as Quilty, he just seemed to be overacting horribly and confused me--was this supposed to be a serious drama or a very broad comedy? I really don't think Kubrick made that clear to Sellers, as Sellers could do well in dramatic or comedic roles--but here, the role just didn't fit the rest of the film at all. Good actor--bad role.Now if you look at all the reviews for this film, most are extremely positive. I wonder (and I'll never know for sure) that if this film had been directed by William Beaudine or some other lesser-name director, would people have gone into such rapturous praise for it? Often, it seems that having the right name at the helm of a film almost guarantees critical acceptance.",Lolita
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Absolutely fascinating, gets better and funnier with each viewing",9,19 June 2016,"Vladimir Nabokov's 'Lolita' is a brilliantly written, beautifully constructed, hilarious (in a black-comedy way), poignant, luridly shocking (but not gratuitously so) and very daring for its time book.Despite me considering it one of the finest books she's ever read, when describing it to people they often give me ""is she mad?"" looks due to its subject matter. Don't let the subject matter turn you off, no matter how it sounds, to me 'Lolita' is an essential read. Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation, which saw Nabokov's involvement, is not exactly faithful and elements are downplayed, but, considering how difficult to adapt the book is and how films had to deal with censorship constraints and studio interference often, Kubrick's film is a very brave and worthy attempt.Kubrick's 'Lolita' also succeeds incredibly well on its own terms, reminding one of Kubrick's 'The Shining' where it is very far removed from the source material but was so much scarier, more atmospheric and more shocking than anything in the more faithful mini-series. It's not quite one of Kubrick's very finest (in a very solid career where to me his only misfire was his debut 'Fear and Desire) but it is one of his most fascinating. Quibbles are very few, with my only quibbles being some over-obvious back projection representing Nabokov's nightmarish vision and the Elstree locations even more so as a result of problems with the economy and censorship.'Lolita' however is brilliantly shot, lit and made with incredible atmosphere and directed with Kubrick's unmistakable masterly touch, meticulous but not as cold as some of his critics have criticised his directing and films for being. It's hauntingly and beguilingly scored too with a memorable main theme. While one does miss some of the book's funniest moments and the subject matter is a little more shocking in the book (with the age gap being more believable), 'Lolita' achieves an ideal balance of hilarious black comedy and affecting drama.The story is lurid, but in a sensually captivating way and never in a vulgar way. It is also relentlessly entertaining and has moments of genuine poignancy. The characters are intriguing and the acting is terrific. Sue Lyon, while slightly too old age-wise (only by a few years though), more than holds her own against her more famous colleagues and is positively alluring. In an incredibly bold career move, James Mason superbly brings cruelty and pathos (his begging at the end is heart-breaking) to Humbert, here a complex character rather than the total creep that he could have been in lesser hands than Mason's. Shelley Winters is riotous and surprisingly poignant, while ever the scene stealer Peter Sellers brilliantly steals every scene he's in in multiple roles, especially great as Quilty, a creepy chameleon sort of character.Overall, a fascinating film and gets better and funnier with each viewing. Not one of my favourites, but one this reviewer appreciates highly. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Lolita
2,bkoganbing,"Those flaming eyes, that flaming youth",9,2 March 2006,"Watching Lolita for the first time a couple of days ago made me think about Thomas Mann's Death in Venice. In the classic film adaption of that novel, protagonist Dirk Bogarde develops an infatuation of a pretty androgynous youth named Tadzio on a holiday in Venice. Mann kills his protagonist without any kind of consummation so the attraction remains pure and the love perfect.Lolita is the opposite side of the coin where through a peculiar state of circumstances protagonist James Mason gets the desire of his heart in Sue Lyon. But as it turns out the plot of Lolita confirms that old adage about being careful what you wish for.James Mason is perfect as the obsessed Humbert Humbert who's parents lack of imagination apparently was not passed on to their offspring. And Sue Lyon scores well as the beautiful, but extremely shallow juvenile that James Mason flips over.Rounding out the principals of the cast are Shelley Winters as Lyons obsessively romantic mother and Peter Sellers who gets to do several characters of his own creation as Clare Quilty, the man who ultimately brings James Mason's world crashing around him.Lolita does hold up well today though a newer version made in 1997 was far more explicit. Another film about obsession that should be seen in conjunction with Lolita is Love and Death on Long Island. Very similar plot line.",Lolita
3,SnoopyStyle,awkward comedic touches odd,7,18 July 2015,"Humbert Humbert (James Mason) confronts and shoots the drunken Clare Quilty (Peter Sellers). Four years previous, divorced Humbert arrives in Ramsdale, New Hampshire to spend a quiet summer before starting his professorship. His widowed landlady Charlotte Haze (Shelley Winters) is desperately sexually frustrated. He is caught immediately by her 14-year-old flirtatious daughter Lolita (Sue Lyon). Clare Quilty is connected with Charlotte and intends on hounding Humbert's relationship with Lolita.Director Stanley Kubrick is a master filmmaker but he's not necessarily a good broad comedic director. He would reunite with Peter Sellers two years later on 'Dr. Strangelove' but that isn't a LOL comedy. It's more surreal quirky. In this movie, it seems like Sellers is trying overboard to be broadly funny. At times, it comes off very annoying. I would rather he try for threatening and dark. The cot scene is slapstick and oddly ill-fitting for the rest of the movie. The movie turns into Three Stooges in the middle of a disturbed drama.On the other hand, I really like James Mason's turn into a pathetic paranoid weeping man. Even Sue Lyon's limited performance turns into something very interesting in her last scene. The subject matter is edgy even in the modern era and the character's age prevented more sexually suggestive scenes. I would prefer to lose a couple of the attempted comedic scenes and make this a lot more darker.",Lolita
4,Hitchcoc,We Like to Watch Accidents Happen,8,7 December 2016,"This is one of those films which is hard to watch. A man gets involved up to his neck with a fourteen year old girl. She is sexy and seemingly available and he wants her with him. He is old enough to be her father. He takes her on a tour of motels and towns. She, of course, is only into herself. She is confused but knows that this guy is bad. She is also willing to run off with someone who will take care of her. Humbert Humbert is way too possessive for her and she has had enough. Sue Lyon is strikingly beautiful in an almost animalistic way. James Mason is the epitome of stuffiness and certainly way too dull for a young woman to be interested in. This, of course, is based on the novel by Vladimir Nabokov. It is the story of a failed self destructive life.",Lolita
5,classicsoncall,"""Cross my heart and hope to die"".",8,29 January 2011,"Not having seen the film before, I was quite surprised with the opening scene, resembling as it did what Charlie Sheen's apartment might have looked like the morning after. Peter Sellers is maddeningly brilliant as the elitist Quilty, and by the time the picture has run it's course, you might get the idea that he had it coming to him.With almost a half century of hindsight, the viewer today might wonder what all the fuss was about back in 1962. This one made headlines with it's controversial theme, but even watching it back then, one would have noted that there was more in the way of suggestion than in actual on-screen titillation. In fact, it's not till nearly the end of the film when Lolita (Sue Lyon) confesses to Humbert (James Mason) that she 'cheated' on him because she had to. Which is the picture's way of confirming that they had their own thing going on, even when you weren't quite sure if Humbert was the creep he was made out to be.Now Shelley Winters - how good was she as Charlotte Haze? She runs the gamut here from a seven year repressed sexuality to a raging hostility upon discovering the diary. When she broke down that first time Humbert spurned her, she showed all the pathos of a woman dreading the remainder of a life left unloved.You know what was pretty slick? In Lolita's bedroom, she had that commercial ad of Quilty on her wall where he was hawking Drome cigarettes. Later on in the picture, impersonating the school psychologist, Quilty offers Humbert a Drome, then gives him the pack. That was pretty clever I thought.Besides the story, one might also take away some appreciation for the depiction of the era back in the Sixties. State roads didn't have that huge interstate highway feel to them yet, and you have a rare look at some of the leading commercial brands of the day. There's that Cott Beverage truck at an intersection, and at various points along the way you have gas stations featuring Esso, Standard Oil and Mobilgas, curiously depicting the Texaco flying horse.What I found intriguing after viewing the picture was taking a look at the theatrical trailer. It promotes the picture with scenes that make the movie seem a comedy rather than dealing with the mature and serious subject matter that it does. It leads me to consider how viewers back in the early Sixties might have felt having seen the picture based on it's ad. Of course today, this picture is rather mild compared to the original hype, and would hardly raise a brow.",Lolita
6,lee_eisenberg,a slight reference to fairy tales,7,13 September 2005,"""Lolita"" may not be one of Stanley Kubrick's greatest movies, but he did a good job with it. The plot of course concerns Prof. Humbert Humbert's (James Mason) obsession with ""nymphet"" Lolita Haze (Sue Lyon), to the point where he marries her mother Charlotte (Shelley Winters) and doesn't tell Lolita when Charlotte gets killed. But when I took a class called Stanley Kubrick's Movies, we discussed another theme: fairy tales. Humbert is like a knight protecting fair maiden Lolita from the enigmatic Clare Quilty (Peter Sellers). They even strengthen the fairy tale idea by having Humbert kill Quilty in a castle-like house, dressing Lolita as a fairy in one scene, and having them watch a monster movie. As for the frequent insanity theme in Kubrick's movies, here it is obsession: Humbert's lust for this ""nymphet"" takes him completely over to the point where he starts becoming cruel. But anyway, it's a pretty good - if disturbing - movie.",Lolita
7,jboothmillard,Lolita,8,25 March 2012,"From Golden Globe nominated director Stanley Kubrick (2001: A Space Odyssey, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket), this film featuring in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die is one that sounded interesting when I read the description, so I was certainly going to watch it. Basically, set in the 1950's, the film begins with Prof. Humbert Humbert (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated James Mason) confronting a drunk Clare Quilty (Golden Globe nominated Peter Sellers) in an old mansion, and after an almost meaningless discussion and meeting Humbert murders Quilty by gunshots. The film flashes back four years, and we see Humbert spending summer in Ramsdale, New Hampshire before his Beardsley College, Ohio professorship begins, and it is there that he is allowed to rent a house, living with sexually frustrated widow Charlotte Haze (Golden Globe nominated Shelley Winters) and her teenage daughter Lolita (introducing Sue Lyon). Humbert finds himself instantly attracted and slowly falling for Lolita, who is overtly flirtatious, for a while he has to deal with Charlotte trying to get her hands on him, until Lolita may be going away to camp, and he is asked to leave, unless he feels the same way Charlotte does, so almost out of pity he marries her. Their relationship is of course a sham, and with the absence of nymphet Lolita things are going ever more sour, and it gets worse when Charlotte reads his diary and finds out his feelings for her daughter, and without him seeing her she runs outside to be hit by a car and die. Humbert picks up Lolita driving to Camp Climax, she has no idea that her mother is dead, and they check into a hotel until he knows what to do next, and more pressure is put on him with police officers in the building attending a convention. One night a stranger is trying to make advances on Humbert, and he has very mysterious interest in his ""beautiful little daughter"", but he manages to escape this stranger, and by the next morning he and Lolita start a sexual relationship. In public, while travelling to other hotels and motels, they keep up the pretence of being ""father"" and ""daughter"", and after several days he confesses that he lied to her about her mother being sick and that she is actually dead, and after grieving she sees no choice but to stay with him. After Humbert enrols Lolita in Beardsley College, people soon become suspicious of the relationship of the ""father"" overprotecting his ""daughter"", and they even get a visit at their place from a strange pushy stranger with a thick German accent, Dr. Zempf (Sellers), and they soon hit the road again. There is a point when Lolita gets sick and is put in hospital, but she disappears when Humbert goes back for her, Nurse Mary Lore (Lois Maxwell, just before becoming Miss Moneypenny in the James Bond 007 films) says she left by another man claiming to be her uncle, leaving him devastated and with no clue where she has gone. A few years pass, and he written to by Lolia, now Mrs. Richard T. Schiller, who is pregnant and has married a famous playwright named Dick (Gary Cockrell), and asking him for money he goes to their home to see her personally. Lolita finally confesses the truth regarding her kidnap three years ago, it was famous playwright Clare Quilty, also the man who had been following them, and disguised himself as Dr. Zempf, and they also had an affair themselves, but it had in fact continued while she with Humbert. Humbert begs Lolita to leave her new life with Dick and come with him, but she refuses, but she is so happy with his generous $13,000, which was from her mother, and of course he finds Quilty in that scene at the beginning, the final text says Humbert was awaiting trial for murder but died of coronary thrombosis. Also starring Diana Decker as Jean Farlow, Jerry Stovin as John Farlow, Marianne Stone as Vivian Darkbloom, Susanne Gibbs as Mona Farlow, Roberta Shore as Lorna, Eric Lane as Roy and Goldfinger's Cec Linder as Physician. Mason gives his usual straight forward, dark and troubled performance really well, newcomer Lyons is beautiful and a young presence as the title character, Winters is also beautiful and is both sad and funny as the lonely woman desperate for a man's company, and Sellers is fantastic as the much needed comic relief and sometimes creepy character who keeps popping up. Kubrick certainly brings his own unique style to the picture, it was apparently a difficult novel to make into a film, and the older man in love with the younger girl is a good story to draw you in, it is a most watchable black comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium. Very good!",Lolita
8,ccthemovieman-1,"Nothing Like You've Heard - Nothing, Period.",3,18 May 2006,"This was supposed to be so sexual and so controversial, and I can see why the ""controversy"" with an older man getting sexually attracted and involved with a teenager but there is very sexuality in this movie....just implied, and very little of anything happens in this film.Sue Lyon, in her first shot, is very alluring lying on her side in a bikini but after that she has the appearance of any other good-looking teen and nothing extraordinary....so if men are looking to be titillated by this film, go elsewhere.In fact, an annoying and shrill Shelly Winters is seen quite a bit, too much so rather than Lyon. Peter Sellers, with an American accent, is good.Overall, this movie is Boring, yes - with a capital 'B."" People today would laugh at any of this being called ""controversial."" Just because it had that label and Stanley Kubrick directed, people automatically overrate this movie terribly. Don't believe me? Go ahead: rent it. Don't say you weren't warned.",Lolita
9,rmax304823,About the best we can expect.,8,12 April 2008,"Kubrick has done a good job of transposing the story from novel to film, with a screenplay by the author, Vladimir Nabokov.James Mason is outstanding as the snooty but distinctly human professor Humbert Humbert who falls in love with the nymphet named Lolita, Sue Lyon. And Shelley Winters is great as Lyons' mother, Charlotte Haze. The script sticks fairly closely to the book, although some collapsing and elisions are inevitable. I doubt, though, that Nabokov actually was responsible for the shooting script. It was his first and last screenplay.Having said that, it has to be admitted that the film has weaknesses, compared to the novel. For one thing, Kubrick refused to shoot outside of his new homeland, England, and only some skimpy second-unit shots are used to convey the sense of motion across the US map. The novel captures perfectly some quotidian images from American -- a red neon sign in the shape of a coffee pot blinking on and off, the shadows of poplar leaves on a small town's honor roll in the afternoon sunshine. Nabokov was a butterfly hunter and kept careful notes of these observations while traveling around the West in search of prey. Dolores, Colorado, was one of those towns. All this local color is missing from the movie.And if most of the cast consists of seasoned professionals, some of the performances fall flat. Poor Sue Lyon. I understand she was fourteen when this was shot but she looks about seventeen. The original Lolita -- the reason the story was considered shocking at the time of publication (1958) and still is by some people -- aged from twelve to fourteen while under salivating Dr. Humbert's tutelage. She was a bright but vulgar kid. Sue Lyon resembles a glossy starlet and hardly utters a believable word. (She was to improve later.) Quilty the guilty is played by Peter Sellers. He has about five roles. Some are fine, such as the psychologist Dr. Zempf (German for ""mustard""). Others, such as his faux detective at The Enchanted Hunters, sound poorly improvised -- to the point of discomfort.That just about gets the weaknesses out of the way. Oh -- there's a bit of slapstick when the hotel porter brings a folding cot to Humbert's room and the two men try to unfold it without waking the sleeping Lolita. It's like a Laurel and Hardy routine, and it's been criticized by some as not fitting the template, but I don't agree at all. The situation itself is absurd -- horny Humbert grimly determined to seduce Lolita while at the same time drifting in and out of sleep. In the novel the scene is hilarious and poetic at the same time. Humbert lies next to Lolita (no cot in the book) and listens to the night noises of the hotel -- the clattering elevator, the guy in the next room puking up his liquor into the toilet, the loud ladies in the hallway -- and if you can't have those prose jokes you can at least have a hotel porter bonked on the head by a cot that insists on folding itself back together.The novel is richly comic and Kubrick's movie comes about as close as we're likely to get to capturing some of its humor as well as its pathos. I don't know why some easy laughs are omitted from the film though. In the book, when the desk clerk mispronounces his name, Humbert replies with indignation, ""The name is not Hamburg and not Humbird, but rather Herbert -- I mean Humbert."" (Maybe nobody else finds that funny.) Compared to Adrian Lynes' later version, featuring a splendid actor, Jeremy Irons, this one is funnier and sunnier. Lynes' Clare Quilty, the villain, is a shadowy and witless heavy, while Peter Sellers is snappy and tormenting, and as bright as Humbert, as he should be, since they're brothers under the skin in their lust for Lolita.There isn't space to get into much of this but I should add that this is not a story of pedophilia. The fact that Lolita is too young, by our standards, is beside the point, the point being that Humbert has fallen into one of those traps common to most of our lives -- falling deeply in love with someone who is willing to play with you but then forgets you the moment you're out of sight. This is a love story by any measure. In the novel, the scene in which Humbert and Lolita meet for the last time is immeasurably poignant. And, really, we have to feel a little sorry for Humbert's possessiveness. Imagine being a middle-aged man with a resentful and straying wife. Now imagine a middle-aged man whose barely pubescent daughter is angrily establishing her independence from the household. And the wife and daughter are one and the same. Doubly cursed.Watch this, if you can. And then -- here's a thought -- read the novel if you haven't already.",Lolita
10,moonspinner55,"""Cha-cha-cha...""",7,9 April 2001,"All the acting in Stanley Kubrick's ""Lolita"" is top notch, but I could not get enough of Sue Lyon's sleepy/sexy gaze, the suspicious eyes and crooked smile, the flip talk and deep voice. She was given a bad rap at the time because she's of course much older than the character was in Nabokov's book (critics seemed to blame this on Sue!); however, she's more than capable in the role, at times excellent, always a presence and a very exciting one. James Mason--despite a monotone British voice which exudes masculinity but little inflection--is a decent Humbert Humbert, the lover of little girls (when I read Vladimir Nabokov's book, I pictured Rex Harrison). Shelley Winters is a scream as Lolita's mother, though the picture really picks up once she's gone. Peter Sellers is indeed overused as Humbert's walking paranoia, and the story-threads involving his character fail to come together. Still, the photography, most of the writing, Kubrick's direction, and Nelson Riddle's score are marvelous, as is Sue Lyon. What a temptress this one is! *** from ****",Lolita
11,edwagreen,****,10,5 September 2015,"Definitely a sinister view of life with outstanding acting by James Mason and Shelley Winters. Mason is the college professor who rents a room from Winters and becomes obsessed with her daughter, Sue Lyon, in her film debut.Problem is that Shelley wants the professor for herself and pulls out nearly all the stops possible before she finally gets him, only to find his diary. Shelley Winters was always good when she was a vulnerable character and there is no exception here. She also does her usual whining and it's a real shame when she exits the film unexpectedly.The rest of the film shows the relationship between Mason and his step-daughter. Peter Sellers steals the scenes he is in while playing a variety of characters in the fashion of Dr. Strangelove which would come later.A great film questioning moral virtue and the needs of individuals. Satire at its very best.",Lolita
12,wes-connors,Filling Cavities with Stanley Kubrick,9,20 January 2013,"In a bizarre opening scene, English professor James Mason (as Humbert ""Hum"" Humbert) shoots drunken playwright Peter Sellers (as Clare Quilty). The debauchery subsides as director Stanley Kubrick takes us back in time ""Four years earlier,"" we find Mr. Mason arriving in the US to write and lecture. He rents a room and moves in with shrill landlady Shelley Winters (as Charlotte Haze), a sexually pent-up widow. Mason is turned on by Ms. Winters' snotty teenage daughter Sue Lyon (as Dolores ""Lolita"" Haze), who is introduced in a sexy bikini and gives him ""come hither"" looks. Mason marries Winters, but yearns for Ms. Lyon...""Lolita"" was considered very controversial upon release, but is more tame by today's standards. Foremost, Mason's character is only technically a ""pedophile"" - and as much so as any of her other possible ""partners"" over the age of consent (which varies in the US). The only certain sex is evidenced by a pregnancy. In the original Vladimir Nabokov novel, the man is clearly a pedophile. Herein, Lyon is playing an oversexed young (high school-aged) woman and Sellers' recurring character changes the focus considerably. The opening makes it a murder mystery and, by the end, can be seen to confirm ""men"" as victims of the alluring temptress...Mr. Kubrick's revision is excellent, but could have stood some more tightening of the storyline involving Sellers' intestinal character. The film goes on for such long stretches, we forget the shocking opening completely and consider Sellers an intruder. Possibly due to the subject matter, there was only a scattering of awards for the four principal actors; Mason deserved ""Best Actor"" consideration for his portrayal. And, Winters delivered one of her many blowzy ""Best Supporting Actress""-worthy characterizations. Her line to Sellers about ""Lolita"" sums up the story in a nutshell: ""Wednesday she's going to have a cavity filled by your Uncle Ivar."" ********* Lolita (6/12/62) Stanley Kubrick ~ James Mason, Shelley Winters, Sue Lyon, Peter Sellers",Lolita
13,Doylenf,Dark comedy has its moments but overall it's a yawn...,5,1 January 2007,"If it weren't for JAMES MASON's brilliant performance and an occasional moment of truth from SHELLEY WINTERS (who manages to be annoying and poignant at the same time), this LOLITA would not be worth viewing. Supposedly controversial because of its pedophile angle, it has SUE LYONS looking more like a normal late teen rather than a twelve year-old nymphet as described in the novel, which blunts the theme of the story right from the start. Then too, the novel was too racy for the censors so Stanley Kubrick made a whole bunch of changes which manage to turn the film into a semi-successful black comedy with good performances from Mason, Winters and PETER SELLERS (as Clare Quilty).But overall, it's got a lot of dull stretches before it reaches the point where the obsessive Mason (as Prof. Humbert Humbert) tracks down the missing nymphet and finds that she is married to a pleasant if dull-witted husband in a very provincial household that is little more than a shack. This is the scene where Mason really shows his stuff, turning the embarrassingly clumsy final meeting with Lyons into a tour-de-force of polished acting and making us sympathize heavily with his situation.All of the titillation the book caused and a furor of publicity over the boldness of the theme has been obliterated by the changes Kubrick was forced to make in bringing the story, damaged by censorship, to the screen. Nevertheless, it has moments of truth and irony and Sellers, in particular, provides moments of hilarity.Still, a disappointing and very flawed film version.",Lolita

15,grantss,A classic,8,10 September 2015,"Every bit the classic and as controversial as it is made out to be. The shock value is still there, nearly 50 years on. Well constructed story, how faithful to Nabokov's book, I don't know, as I haven't read the book. The plot does drag and lose focus in the third quarter though. A bit more editing and faster pacing over that section would have made this a great movie, rather than a good movie. Great performances all round. The hidden gem, though, is Peter Sellers' performance. His over-the-top crazy egomaniacal character is played to perfection.

16,Boba_Fett1138,Another Kubrick must see.,9,27 September 2005,"This movie is typically Kubrick. It has an unusual atmosphere, subtle humor and is filled with some marvelous, unforgettable, artistic scene's, which all helps to make ""Lolita"" an unforgettable movie experience.The story is both original and daring even though the movie never really goes far or deep into things. But considering that it was 1962 when this movie was released still makes it fair to call this movie a daring one. It's a story that begins as perhaps innocent illegal love but later turns into an unhealthy obsession. The movie is about two and an halve hours long but the movie never feels dull or slow, which is probably mainly thanks to the masterful storytelling by Kubrick.The performances by the cast are really excellent. James Mason is great as the leading (gentle)man of the movie. Very good and certainly very enjoyable in his role is Peter Sellers who plays a character that can take many identities. A kind of character that Sellers always loved to play. Some other fine roles are portrayed by Shelley Winters and by Sue Lyon, in the title role.But most credit once more has to go to Stanley Kubrick who manages to create the perfect atmosphere for the movie and gives the scene's lots of style and artistic beauty. It may not be the best movie in the world, the movie has too many little flaws for that but the movie most certainly is a memorable one, which makes it also a must see for everyone.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Lolita
17,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Excellent,8,14 November 2009,"""How did they ever make a movie of Lolita"", as the tag-line goes, much repeated in the trailer on the DVD? In 1962, in the time that strict censorship of any taboo topic forced Hitchcock to film and cut the infamous shower scene of Psycho rather creatively, nobody but Kubrick had the talent or the gall to even attempt it. I haven't read the novel, so I'm afraid I cannot provide a comparison. As I understand, this has less comedy, and not as thorough insight into Humbert Humbert. Just as with the 1997 adaptation, you hear his thoughts as voice-over narration. I'm not certain which has more of it. The role, played by James Mason, you find it difficult to completely either resent or sympathize with him. He is a human being, with flaws as well as a conscience. The title character is given a soft, playful musical theme that perfectly accentuates her behavior and appearance. Sue Lyon nails it, exuding child-like innocence as well as budding womanhood. She was actually 14 at the time. Obviously, this could not get away with being overtly sexual, as the Irons/Swain version tried to; here, it is all innuendo, hints and subtlety. It remains provocative, and the core is not lost. The acting is all spot-on, and Sellers is his usual oddball self, and it really works. Dialog is flawlessly written and delivered. The cinematography and editing are impeccable, and this has some unforgettable visuals. There is disturbing content in this, and brief mild violence.

Kubrick's version of the Nabokov novel, scripted by Nabokov himself, comes as close as any film adaptation could probably come of capturing the genius inherent in the novel. It knows which parts of the novel to leave out, where to embellish, and most importantly, it retains the surreal tone and sick sense of humour of Nabokov's story. Kubrick was forced to tone down the sexuality somewhat, and Lolita's age is bumped up from 12 to 16 at the story's start, but the movie still feels shocking, and it's no wonder that it was greeted with a storm of controversy upon its release.The acting is nearly flawless, and it feels remarkably naturalistic for a movie from this time period. Sue Lyon is simply terrific as Lo, and she and James Mason have a lot of chemistry when they're on screen together. Shelley Winters is sensational as Charlotte Haze--almost too sensational, as the film seems to lose something once she's no longer part of the story. The only actor that suffers from the material is Peter Sellers. He's never less than great, but too many of his scenes feel as if they were added to give him more to do rather than because they really serve the plot of the story. They feel superfluous, and contribute to a pace that every once in a while drags. The character of Clare Quilty was left more ambiguous in the novel--Nabokov and Kubrick's attempts to turn him into a more concrete character and justify his appearance in the film provide the adaptation its only stumbling block. Otherwise, this is an exceptional movie of an exceptional work of literature.Grade: A",Lolita
19,HotToastyRag,Peter Sellars ruins the movie,5,2 July 2018,"I was haunted by stories my grandpa told me about Lolita years before I first saw it, namely how nasty the movie was and how many loopholes the filmmakers had to jump through to get the pedicure scene past the censors. Even though the Hays Code was no longer powerful, there was still a sense of decency in 1962, and Lolita practically broke it.I'm not spoiling anything, by the way. The opening credits are shown over a closeup of Sue Lyon's toes. The first scene-the scenes are punctuated by lots of ""suggestive"" blackouts, so get used to them-is of an outraged, emotional James Mason who points a gun at a hungover Peter Sellars, who tries to talk and stall for time. Peter Sellars is so incredibly annoying, creepy, and disgusting, he pretty much ruins the movie. I learned later that his part wasn't initially so large, but that he kept ad-libbing and director Stanley Kubrick liked what he was doing so much he expanded his role. I wish he hadn't. I could probably have watched it a second time if it weren't for Peter Sellars. I beg you, if you've never seen him in a movie, don't rent Lolita yet. You will hate him the rest of your life. After the first scene, the movie goes back in time; I think the movie would have been stronger if it started after the first scene. Everyone's waiting to see Sue Lyon, and they'd get to see her that much sooner! Reportedly, about 800 girls auditioned for the title role. Sue was only fifteen years old when she filmed her scenes with the fifty-three-year-old James Mason; I wonder what her parents were thinking. There's so much interesting trivia about this movie and the initial casting choices; Cary Grant, Marlon Brando, Rex Harrison, Errol Flynn, David Niven, Laurence Olivier, Peter Ustinov, and Charles Boyer were all offered the part before James Mason was freed from his Broadway commitments.Anyway, James Mason is looking to rent a room, and Shelley Winters nearly drowns in her sea of drool as she shows him the spare room in her house. He clearly isn't interested, in her or her room, but when she shows him the garden outside and he sees her daughter Sue Lyon in a bikini, he decides to become their new lodger. So starts an incredibly disgusting love triangle between mother, daughter, and lodger. James is a respectable author and professor, and with his sensitivity and restraint-yes, that word does apply to the first half of the movie-it's totally understandable why Sue would develop a crush on the handsome, older man. And Sue is so unbelievable beautiful, it's almost understandable why James loses his mind in his attraction to her. Obviously, if you're uncomfortable with this subject matter, you're not going to want to rent Lolita. And if you're just in the mood for a steamy good time, this isn't the movie for you. Maybe the remake has more steamy scenes, but this version of Lolita is much more involved in the psychological aspects of their relationship. Restraint and palpable tension are the overwhelming themes to the film, so be prepared if you rent it. Keep in mind it was made in 1962, and the mere fact that the film was made was a miracle, so there's no nudity or sex scenes that would be necessary for modern audiences.I like James Mason very much, and it's only because of my fondness for him that Lolita didn't ruin my opinion of him. If this was the first movie of his I'd seen, I probably wouldn't like him at all. There's no denying that he's a very handsome man and a very good actor, but his character is pretty unlikable. Yes, you feel sorry for him that he's dominated by inappropriate lust, but to Shelley, he acts like a jerk. Shelley doesn't do anything wrong; she falls in love with an available man her own age and gets treated unfairly. For example, she writes him a love letter and as he reads it aloud, he bursts out laughing. She's been given a very sympathetic character, and I'm sure your heart will go out to her in this film.If you really like James Mason and want to see one of his iconic films, go ahead and rent this one, but know what you're getting into. This is a heavy, psychological drama, not a steamy romance. He does a very good job, but the story is a bit disturbing, so it's not the type of movie you'll want to watch over and over again. But, at least you'll be able to say you've seen it. And you'll probably develop a fantasy of wanting James Mason to paint your toenails.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. And just as obviously, since the entire movie involves an inappropriate sexual relationship with a minor, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",Lolita
20,Aaron1375,"Interesting movie, you can sympathize with most of the characters.",7,10 January 2011,"This film is usually not the type I would watch, however it came on one of those movie stations and I thought I would watch it because it had Peter Sellers in it and Stanley Kubrick directed it. Not my favorite director, just someone who generally makes an interesting movie that also usually ends up kind of overlong. This one is no exception, as it runs a bit to long, but it was a different kind of movie to be sure. The movie's plot is about a man who falls for a very young girl. This fact, however, does not make him an unsympathetic character in my eyes because the girl may be underage, but she is very attractive. Any guy would have a hard time ignoring her. It is not like the remake in 1997, now in that one the girl is underage and looks it and you get more of a creepy vibe in that one. This one though you feel for the guy as you do the mother and of Lolita herself. The only character I had no sympathy for is Peter Seller's character, an oily kind of guy that seems to be playing some sort of game with everyone's life and he does not seem to truly love Lolita as the main character most certainly does. The movie ends how one would expect it to, making me feel even more sorry for the man in love with Lolita. Very sad to see him give her up. I am not saying the man is a saint or anything, his life and that of the mother would have been better off if he had never developed feelings for the young girl or had pursued him, but like I said I found him to be someone you could feel bad for. Though that goes for everyone in the film with the exception of the Seller's character, so bizarre that I had the most dislike for his character when he is the reason I watched it in the first place.",Lolita
21,Sylviastel,A Bit Disturbing!,9,19 April 2008,"James Mason gives a brilliant performance as Humbert Humbert, a European literature professor, who visits Ramsdale, New Hampshire where he is befriended by Oscar Winner Shelley Winters in a great performance as widow Charlotte Haze who is all over him. He marries her only to get close to Lolita, Charlotte's beautiful daughter who is way advanced for a 13 or 14 year old girl. Lolita and Humbert quietly and discretely hide their relationship which was probably why the film was banned upon it's release. It's troubling to see an intellectual professor in a doomed relationship with a girl that could stand for statutory rape. While this film breached upon a neglected subject of the time such as improper relations between adults and young teens. Sue Lyons gives a commendable performance while Shelley Winters makes your heart break as needy Charlotte. Peter Sellers CBE plays Quilty. Of course, the film was written by it's author, Vladimir Nabokov, and directed by the master, Stanley Kubrick.",Lolita
22,christopher-underwood,A very impressive film and a joy to watch for many reasons despite (or maybe because of) censorship restrictions.,9,30 July 2019,"A very impressive film and a joy to watch for many reasons despite (or maybe because of) censorship restrictions. The exquisite but unsettling image of the young girl's toe nails being painted beneath the opening credits sets the tone, even if nothing more intimate is shown. James Mason does well in the central role and certainly has to stretch himself in a much broader role than he might be used to. Shelley Winters, a much underrated actress, does especially well as the blousy, self interested seductress with a misplaced sense of morality that she sees as only applying to others. Sue Lyon at fourteen playing eleven/twelve is remarkable, with only the big hair of the period marring the dangerously appealing look. Kubrick treads a fine line and produces a convincing telling of the tale and it is only towards the end that things become a little less convincing but overall the film flows well throughout its length, always looks good and is full of real surprises. Then there is Peter Sellers. In a role much expanded for the film the man displays his genius and is a genuine pleasure to watch and enjoy. The wonder and humour of his performance(s) is ultimately all the more poignant as we get closer to the full acceptance of the awful truth.",Lolita
23,JamesHitchcock,A Work of Art in Its Own Right,8,23 August 2013,"Vladimir Nabokov's novel ""Lolita"" was hugely controversial when first published in 1955. It was banned for a time in both Britain and France, although (rather surprisingly, given the often hysterical moral climate during the Eisenhower years) not in the United States. The reason is that the central character, Humbert Humbert, is not only a murderer but also a paedophile, sexually obsessed with girls between the ages of nine and fourteen or, as he calls them, 'nymphets'. He moves from Europe (he is French in the novel, British in the film) to Ramsdale, a small New England town, where he becomes infatuated with Dolores (""Lolita""), the young daughter of his widowed landlady, Charlotte Haze. After her mother's death in a road accident he seduces her, takes her out of school and sets off with her on a lengthy car journey around America. Given the controversy which the novel had aroused, it was a brave move on the part of Stanley Kubrick to adapt it for the screen only seven years later. Mind you, it would probably be an even braver move to adapt it today. The most common modern reaction to many books, films and popular songs which fell foul either of the censors or of conservative public opinion during the fifties is to ask ""What was all the fuss about?"", but ""Lolita"" retains its power to shock even today. Adrian Lyne's 1997 film version was even more controversial than Kubrick's, and attitudes towards under-age sex have, if anything, hardened over the last sixteen years. As the Production Code was still in force in 1962, Kubrick had to agree to many changes to Nabokov's original story to make his film acceptable to the American censors. There is not enough space in this review to detail all these changes, but the overall effect was to make the story less sexually explicit and to make Humbert more sympathetic. In the film it is never expressly stated that Humbert and Lolita sleep together, although it is implied. In the book Lolita is only twelve when Humbert first meets her; in the film her age is never given, although she appears to be about sixteen. (Sue Lyon was fourteen when filming took place, but looked older). The weakest part of the book is the sub-plot involving Clare Quilty, Humbert's rival for Lolita's affections, who pursues them across America. For most of the book Quilty is a vague, shadowy presence, and when he- despite the feminine-sounding Christian name he is male- finally appears near the end he emerges as a bizarre and eccentric character whom I found it difficult to believe in. Quilty is given a much larger role in the film than in the book, but remains bizarre and eccentric, and Peter Sellers (as one might expect from that particular actor) does everything he can to accentuate this aspect of his character. The episode in which he pretends to be a German psychiatrist seems particularly out-of-place. Sellers, who was to give a far better performance for Kubrick two years later in ""Dr Strangelove"", seemed to have a fetish about German psychiatrists; he was equally weird playing one in ""What's New, Pussycat?""It is sometimes said that there are no great female parts in Kubrick, and certainly some of his films (notably ""Paths of Glory"", ""Strangelove"", ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"") are very male-dominated. ""Lolita"", however, is the exception that proves the rule, as there are two great female performances, from Lyon and from Shelley Winters as Charlotte. Both work perfectly in the context of this particular interpretation of the novel. Lyon's Lolita, older than in the novel, has a sort of provocative innocence; that shot of her in her bikini on the lawn- the first time we see her- is unforgettable. Winters's blowsy, garrulous, sexually frustrated and emotionally incontinent widow is a lot more unpleasant than the Charlotte of the novel, who only seems unpleasant to Humbert himself. The character of Humbert is also changed. In the book he was in his mid- thirties, here he is considerably older. (James Mason was over 50). The film omits any reference to his lifelong obsession with ""nymphets"" and, indeed, makes virtually no reference to his life before his arrival in Ramsdale. Also omitted are many of Humbert's more despicable actions, such as the scene where he drugs Lolita with intent to rape her. Nabokov's unreliable narrator (the book is told by Humbert in the first person) is often a creepy, sinister individual whose attempts at self- justification never quite ring true. Mason's performance also works well in this interpretation, playing Humbert as a suave, debonair intellectual, a courtly gentleman of the Old World who is a fish out of water in the vulgar cultural wasteland of the New. (Kubrick was American by birth but spent most of his adult life in Britain and could be critical of his native country). Mason's Humbert is less a seedy sexual predator than a distinguished middle-aged man undone by a foolish infatuation with a much younger girl. The novel can be seen as a pervert's progress in which Humbert condemns himself out of his own mouth. The film is more of a classical tragedy in which Humbert is brought down by a flaw in his character. Lyne, by all accounts, was no great admirer of Kubrick's film and hoped that his own would be more faithful to the book. It is that, but it is also rather dull and pedestrian by comparison. The changes Kubrick made to the story may have been forced upon him by the demands of the censors, yet it is a tribute to his skill as a film-maker that his version, with the exception of some of the Quilty scenes, reads so fluently as a work of art in its own right. 8/10",Lolita
24,DKosty123,Professor Bizarre Meets An M Dialer,7,30 August 2009,"14 year old Sue Lyon is amazing as a teenager in a bizarre relationship with 2 men. The relationship with Sellers character is only mentioned in passing but is there. The relationship with James Mason's Professor is central to the them of this film.Mason here is just as restrained in this film as he is in Dial M For Murder years earlier. He plays someone deranged in both films in the same way only this time he is into a banned relationship with a step daughter who is underage. When you picture Mason as himself, you have trouble having sympathy for him, though you almost do.This film, while not Kubricks best effort is good because of the casting. If Kubrick had been allowed to do a truly X rate version of the story baring all, it would have been better since his way of creating the X rated visuals would have taken the straight-jacket off him which is truly on him with the censorship of this era in full force.Shelly Winters & Lois Maxwell are names who have roles in this film as well. While the film works OK as a no action drama, I don't think it is the best story telling I have seen.",Lolita
25,lasttimeisaw,Lolita,7,14 August 2010,"Just finished watching this film, so I want to record what's inside my head. Kubrick is definitely one of my favorite directors, and I had also watched 1997 version of LOLITA by Adrian Lyne around 10 years ago. So without re-watching the latter, it is difficult for me to compare these two films at this moment. Obviously enough LOLITA is a tacky job for any director, because its story and characters, four main characters were all so unlovable by their own selfishness. Humbert is propelled by his eccentric lust, Charlotte is driven by her shameless desperation, Lolita, of course, she is manipulating all the male who coveted her beauty, as for Quilty, his evil side is more understandable in a franker way. So with four ""bad"" characters tangled with each other, who is the ultimate winner? the answer is our little nymph LOLITA!The acting is strong, but apart from two main leaders, I am more impressed by Shelley Winters, who delivers a more powerful punch as a lonely single mother who just needs someone to love her and chooses a wrong man by her own wishful thinking. So after Charlotte's death, the latter part of the film loses its intense gusto. Peter Sellers is dislikable and weird with his strange accent (it is said he imitates Kubrick), he shows his acting talent but annoys me. James Mason is well-captured of the goody-goody professor, but as his positive image (I still vividly remember his role in A STAR IS BORN) really roots inside my mind, I fear that he is trying too hard to elaborate the character. Sue Lyon as Lolita, no question it is a great start for anyone's acting career, she is adorable with a disproportional maturity. Frankly speaking her role actually is the easiest one, all one need is to find the right person, and Kubrick did it. Owing to the censor system at 1960s, no sex scene is shot between Humbert and Lolita, maybe that's why there is a detectable incompatibility between them, which makes all the innuendos are unconvincing. The film is largely overshadowed at the time when it has been released in 1962, without much major recognitions in Oscars, definitely not Kubrick's best work, it still shines with its contemporary wit of how one can be dragged by his uncontrollable lust deep inside him.http://xingshizuomeng.blogspot.com/",Lolita
26,Red-Barracuda,A very bold and carefully handled movie,8,23 January 2014,"Lolita presented director Stanley Kubrick with a proper challenge. How do you adapt a novel that tells the story of a middle-aged academic who develops a sexual obsession with a 15 year old girl? It's very tricky material even for a film today, far less one made over fifty years ago. It's one of those rare occasions where I am thankful for film censorship, as this is the kind of material that could be horrendous if too much is shown. As it is, the movie version has raised the age of the girl from twelve to fifteen and you have to regard this as understandable! As it is, a lot is alluded to here, although it's still pretty clear what's going on and it is disturbing.Sixteen year old Sue Lyon plays the fifteen year old title character and she is very impressive. Because of its nature it's not an easy role but she has the requisite mixture of the childlike and old beyond her years. The central character though is Professor Humbert Humbert played by James Mason. He also has a very difficult role in that he is the middle-aged man who lusts after this teenager. He is entirely unsympathetic yet convincingly played by Mason. But best of all is probably Peter Sellers who is Clare Quilty a TV personality who is in many ways Mason's doppelganger; a man who also is sexually attracted to this young girl. Quilty is an especially odd character and Sellers steals every scene he is in. Both Quilty and Humbert are introduced in a great mysterious opening scene where the latter kills the former, thus setting the scene and leaving us with more questions than answers. There is a second particularly good sequence between these characters mid-way through the film where they meet in a motel. Quilty has his back to Humbert during the entire conversation and it's very weird and uncomfortable.Despite, or probably because of, the disturbing central plot-line there is a lot of comedy in Lolita. More accurately black comedy. This does lighten things a little, even if there are occasions where it does seem out of place. Like all Kubrick movies it's very well made technically, with good cinematography. It could probably be argued that it is a touch overlong perhaps and maybe it peters out a bit towards the end slightly. But, these issues aside, it remains a strong piece of work and especially impressive when you consider the potency of the source material. It has to be considered a successful and daring movie.",Lolita
27,ElMaruecan82,"There's just something about ""Lolita"" ...",9,24 April 2011,"""Lolita"" from Stanley Kubrick is an exquisite portrayal of the debauchery inhabiting the bourgeoisie's bored hearts, in their quest of a flame that would give a meaning to their insipid lives mostly made of conventions and futile manners. The protagonist of the film is not a man to embarrass himself with futility, his quite unusual name, Humbert Humbert, indicates a heart more inclined to originality, to live a devouring passion rather than succumbing to the easy choice of being a good member of a rather despised community. ""Lolita"" is less about sex than a rebellious attitude incarnated by a forbidden passion, a passion that would make the straightest man adopt the most romantic attitude, just to conquer a lovely, beautiful, sensual but forbidden fruit  named Lolita  A man said once that ""we have the age of people who love us"", this sentence, debatable or accurate, sounds like an excuse for Humbert, the serious and straight faced James Mason, to fall in love with the beautiful blonde fourteen-year old pearl, Dolores aka Lolita. Age is not a matter if she does have a fondness for him. But we all know this is wrong. I haven't personally read the novel from Nabokov, and in a way, it didn't interfere with my appreciation of the film, or influence it negatively, so I'm only judging the movie. And from the movie, all I can say is that Kubrick once again, proved again his directing talent by casting the delicious Sue Lyon for the titular role. She indeed looks young enough to make James Mason, in his early fifties then, look like an ""old man"", but sexy enough to create a masculine empathy towards Humbert. In the memorable garden scene, where Humbert and Lolita's eyes meet after she take off her sunglasses, I'm sure every man would have fallen in love with this dolly face, full of mystery and guilty temptations, incarnated by this soft and almost erotic ""Lolita Ya-Ya"" theme.I mentioned masculine empathy, but this is would be ignoring another central character. Shelley Winters, portrays with a sympathetic poignancy Charlotte, the poor mother who felt for Humbert like he did for her daughter. Winters, as another cinematic victim of her own kindness, lives a reverse Oedipian situation, and is even more humiliated when Humbert starts using her in a complicated scheme whose only necessity is the possession of Lolita ... because this is the very effect of love at first sight, a profound desire to possess one person, that ultimately becomes obsessional. James Mason, in a brilliant performance, embodies the contradictions of a man whose apparent seriousness as a college professor is only a veil to cover the passion flamed by Lolita. The mother fell in love with the professor, ignoring how her daughter revealed the real Humbert. Doomed already, she naturally disappears, without Humbert's intervention as if God wanted Humbert to succeed. But in his long climbing to the possession of Lolita, Humbert will have a pebble in his shoe, Clare Quilty.Quilty, played by Peter Sellers, is the antagonist of the film, from this category of innocent looking villains with no less devastating effects on the protagonists' projects. The severity of his acts can only be measured by the punishment he directly received from Humbert himself, an implacable sentence to death. We don't know the character enough to feel sorry for him, and Mason inspires such trust (indeed, a perfect casting choice) that we believe there's something weird in this character and he played a role damaging enough to get this comeuppance. But the question that haunts us all through the film is why this insistence? Why is he constantly harassing Humbert? Well, I admit, I felt sorry for Humbert, and wondered what were Quilty's motives. Until the revelation made me realize the obvious: that there's just something about Lolita Lolita is like a living passion igniting men's inner perversity, she's the epitome of the innocent sexiness, the forbidden fruit that looks so juicy and delicious that even disobedience would be worse than inaction. The effects she had on Humbert are the same on Quilty, but with a significant difference, she was in love with Quilty. Humbert went from such hardship to finally get Lolita, living with a woman he was mocking, lying, using respectability to mask his pervert nature, becoming a kind of lover submitted to Lolita's every desire, painting her feet nails, that it's heart-breaking to witness his realization that all he incarnated for her is what he was trying not to be: a fatherly figure. Lolita didn't love him but respected him, when Humbert might have preferred the opposite, even if it meant being an arrogant bastard like Quilty. Humbert's tears at the end, were joined by mine, because as forbidden and sinful as it was, that was the powerful and authentic portrayal of the devastating loss of one true love, forever.The opening credits show beautiful little feet being nailed by masculine hands. This memorable overture perfectly illustrates the obsession that can govern our hearts when we fall in love, we can become a servant to our women, an object of suspicion for good society. Humbert didn't even care for suspicion, he was already living in a bourgeois world, where everything was made of pretending (the kind of superficiality that Kubrick will denounce 37 years after in ""Eyes Wide Shut"") All Humbert wanted was to be loved as the man of Lolita's life, but his obsession was like a self-destructive force. Humbert's jealousy turned him into a control freak that would naturally end with a separation, and a descent into madness.It's a happy end for Lolita, who was more a victim of her nature that the passing of years will correct anyway, but for Humbert, it was just the flame that burnt his heart, corrupted his mind, and ravaged his soul, forever",Lolita
28,gbill-74877,Mixed bag,7,19 June 2018,"Like the book, the film is strongest in the beginning, as Humbert Humbert (James Mason) takes a room with a widow (Shelley Winters), only after spotting her teenage daughter (Sue Lyon) lounging around in a bikini. The tension between his forbidden attraction, concealed in sly glances and little gestures, all while Winters practically throws herself at him, is fantastic. Unfortunately, after an event I won't describe to avoid spoiling it, the film drags on and gets a bit ridiculous. The point is to show how ridiculous an infatuation can make a man behave, even if it is taboo, bringing him to humiliation, but the road trip, being pursued, and the recurring character played by Peter Sellers, who is so endearing in the beginning, eventually gets over-used and annoying. The film is far too long at 152 minutes, and another screenwriter should have been used instead of Nabokov. There are several places the film suffers from the Production Code, and we never really feel the sickness of lust from Mason, but Director Stanley Kubrick does get a number of allusions in, and perhaps it's better that the majority of it was left to the imagination. It's disturbing that Sue Lyon was just 14 when filming started, but her performance is impressive, and Shelley Winters is also strong. Kubrick does reasonably well, but errs by wandering into some silly comedic moments, and should have tightened things up.

The main issue why it's not as great as for example ""Barry Lyndon"" and many other i thing is with a script. Although nominated for Oscar as the best screenplay, it wasn't Stanley Kubrick's script, and so it wasn't fully Kubrick's picture.What i found the most surprising about this picture, it's his humor. This is actually more of a dark comedy then a serious exploitation of a relationship between a middle aged professor and a 14 year old girl.Overall, ""Lolita"" is a good picture. It has good acting for this material, good directing, nice script. It's not as good as other director movies, but it's descent picture on it's own. Seriously, the best part of this movie i think was directors work, because at the running time 2h 33 min this movie barely drags and is interesting enough to keep you watching it till the end.

32,didi-5,suggestive not sordid,10,23 February 2003,"Watching Lolita again recently I was struck by the way Kubrick and his cast flesh out the story without resorting to the 'show everything' approach taken in the '97 remake.  Of course Doleres and Humbert are having a sexual relationship, but you get the sense she's done the same pattern before and certainly knows how to lead him on.  Sue Lyon has Lolita's sly looks and mannerisms perfectly attuned to the sleazy confusion of the lodger who marries her overbearing mother just to stay close to the 'little girl' he first spotted in the garden ... I find Lolita the most disturbing character in the film for many reasons - she is directly responsible for the ultimate fates of her mother, Humbert and Quilty (although all contribute in some way to their own destruction).  James Mason is great in a difficult role (I read somewhere this was at one point intended for Noel Coward, which would have been fascinating ... Peter Sellers put his mimicry talents to good use again as Quilty, but manages to invest this character with a true personality as well, you sense he is as much a victim as Humbert.  The only false note is Shelley Winters, who is simply frightful with her cherry pie and her shrine to a 7 years dead husband.

He will later die in prison waiting for his trial. Nothing much altogether that Kubrick transforms into a black and white masterpiece. Apart from the technique, the beauty of the shooting and editing, Kubrick transcends the triteness of the subject with a never directly expressed discourse on love ?. Love is capricious but it is difficult for it to live even only survive in the case of an older man and a younger girl. Suspicion kills the cat and spoils the pussy. They are obliged to hide and this puts dirt on a feeling that could be beautiful. An older man's love is possessive and that destroys love by definition. Then the younger girl will play on the older man's desire for love and secrecy to hide what will be cooking on the side-burner. We can even wonder if for Kubrick at this moment stable and lasting love is plainly possible for older men when young girls are involved. Anne Rice later will look at the problem with feminine eyes and give in « Belinda » a completely different account of such an affair, a love affair. But Anne Rice is fascinated by abnormal beings and situations. So she does not prove anything. Kubrick seems to be repulsed by such conditions and the final chaotic murder place in which the playwright will be put to death is nothing but a pile of trash in an eighteenth century mansion turned into an empty hard-liquor bottle cemetery.

34,johnnyboyz,Twisting and turning film that remains unpredictable and thoroughly engrossing.,8,8 August 2008,"Within Lolita lies a very interesting and very well done story that feels as if it is split into separate parts or chapters that revolve around different things. The best bit about these chapters that feel separated is that when you feel one is in full swing, you remember what and how much the characters had to go through as individuals to get to this point before realising they've got to advance through an entirely new minefield altogether. Most of this realisation is done by Professor Humbert Humbert (Mason) and most of the chaos or indeed situations fabricated is either directly caused by or is because of Lolita (Lyon), the young teenage girl causing the havoc of the film with her good looks and what can be considered as either advanced seduction or pure naivety.Notice how the film is named Lolita; an important aspect of breaking down whose story is being told and who's the lead character. Indeed, the film goes through all the setting up and includes voice-overs of the professor suggesting Humbert himself is the focus but looking at who goes on more of a journey and who travels the most, perhaps it would be easier to state Lolita as the protagonist. The first 'chapter' of the film or at least the first exchanges revolve around a definite power struggle in a large, old house. Humbert looks for a place to stay while he is on business looking for a job placement and is unsure on whether to settle at this accommodation, until that is, he sees Lollita in the garden in all her soft focus and bikini clad glory.What follows is a trilogy of error between three individuals: Humbert, Lolita and Lolita's mother named Charlotte (Winters). The focus here is quite clearly love, but it is a love that will not be returned. Charlotte desires Humbert but he believes her to be an eccentric more than anything else whilst Humbert himself falls for Lolita who herself is involved in another sort of relationship, that being a parental relationship with her mother who dominates her and wishes to remain in control of the young girl. But the film is so well written that you do not identify this power struggle and then get tired of it, hoping it will move onto the next set piece. Instead, characters are given individual scenes and situations, each feeling different to the last, so that they can play off one another.But this is not another screwball comedy where issues like love, immaturity and lust are dismissed as plot ideas to evoke a few laughs. There is a certain tactfulness behind the scene in which the romantic interest is first made aware, the reason being it takes place in a cinema in front of a film  Kubrick's love of the subject and the love the characters share for each other coming out in an iconic location. The recognising of the shot construction also comes into play here, when Humbert gazes at Lolita when at the dance and when both are in the garden initially. So the opening very much focuses on the balance of lust in the mother for Humbert; Humbert for Lolita and Lolita's struggles against her mother  a line that sums this up well is when Charlotte admits the love for Humbert and he replies somewhat dismissively that he 'knows what that feels like' given Lolita is in close proximity. Another interesting dynamic are the reactions of the third party when one of these power struggles are immediately occurring.But the incident that kills off these opening power exchanges is a death, and quite a surprising one at that, more so because it does not affect the overall narrative and themes of love for someone of greater age difference. Instead, it acts as a catalyst for Humbert and Lolita to enter the next stage of their relationship and that's when the feeling I mentioned earlier kicks in; that sensation of sheer unpredictability when a minefield has been crossed and the film then threatens to move up to the next level of intensity. Kubrick also throws in a somewhat out of the blue juxtaposition shot when he cuts to a scene of Humbert singing in the bath after a somewhat eerie prior scene that is the death itself.From here, implied sex and some more scenes revolving around the really nasty place in which Humbert stands in terms of his role follows on. Is he now the parental figure? Is his role of the lover like it always was? Or has it stepped up a gear because a certain element from the previous power struggle is no longer around to act as a superego to both characters. Whatever the situation and whatever the scene, Humbert's study of going close to madness towards the end feels out of place but in a very positive manner. The seduction and trickery during the scene at the hospital which floats to the surface hits relatively hard even though there is a reasonable explanation. Lolita is one of Kubrick's better contemporary efforts and no doubt probably aided in the downing of censorship with its implications and subject matter. That on its own is enough of a reason to watch.",Lolita

36,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Kubrick and the cast rise above censorship to make ""Lolita"" powerful",8,14 June 2011,"Pedophilia doesn't seem the likely subject of a film made in the early '60s, but there's almost a power in the censorship of ""Lolita."" Undoubtedly, the finished product did not represent the initial vision of neither director Stanley Kubrick nor Vladimir Nabokov, who penned the adaptation of his own novel, but the result is a film no less challenging.The fact that ""Lolita"" had to rely on implied sexuality because anything that so much as visually suggested illegal sexual relations could not be filmed, actually makes the film stronger in ways. It puts a lot more weight on the shoulders of James Mason as Humbert Humbert, the professor inappropriately smitten with his landlady's daughter, to convey his lust without conveying his lust, but it also refocuses the story to the psychological profiles of both Humbert and Lolita (Sue Lyon) rather than what they did or didn't do. Dolores ""Lolita"" Haze is the driving force both at times overtly and implicitly throughout the entire story. She lives with her widowed mother Charlotte (Shelley Winters) in the small town of Ramsdale, New Hampshire, where Humbert Humbert intends to spend the summer writing before he begins work as a professor. Looking for a place to rent, he finds the Hazes and agrees to stay after he sees Lolita, who's just 15 but completely physically mature. He's infatuated with the girl instantly and deals with her mother's sexual advances just to stay near her. Upset and implicitly jealous of Lolita, Mrs. Haze sends her away to summer camp. Faced with the possibility of never seeing Lolita again, Humbert marries Mrs. Haze.Lolita seems like an average gum-chewing teenager, but she understands the power she has as an attractive young woman. Even before we first see her, Kubrick's camera-work is restless and frenetic as Charlotte tries to sell Humbert on staying at their home. When they both finally go out back where it happens that Lolita is out sunning in a bikini, the camera stays still on her (no ogling, of course) and everything changes.Humbert's inappropriate motivations regarding Lolita are the most obvious, but even Mrs. Haze lets Lolita get to her. Much like Snow White and the Evil Queen, Charlotte is driven by jealousy because Lolita has her whole life ahead of her and she's young and beautiful, whereas Charlotte feels desperate and unloved in these seven years after her husband's death. Then there's Clare Quilty (Peter Sellers). The film opens with Humbert shooting him to death, with regards to Lolita, and goes back four years earlier to tell the story from the beginning. Quilty appears throughout the story and the implied romantic link between he and Lolita grows stronger as the film goes on, although he remains on the periphery. Not too much, however, because Kubrick devotes a lot of attention to Sellers' performance. He's brilliant (and clearly the inspiration for Kubrick's ""Dr. Strangelove,"" which would reunited the two a few years later), but his comedy does at times drastically change the tone of the film to humor and detract from the central characters' story.Sellers gets to have all the fun, but the challenge belongs mostly to Mason. He must ride a fine line between open lust and hidden obsession, which makes watching his character a torturous experience. He ultimately gets it right, however, because we actually manage a bit of inexplicable sympathy for the creep. Even as his character turns into a possessive parent figure bent on preserving Lolita's innocence for his own selfish reasons, we still agree with bits of his ideology enough to care about him, sadly. The censorship of the film lends a helping hand here because we never literally see Humbert evolve into the disgusting pedophile we're meant to believe him to be.""Lolita"" has to be a rare instance where a film reaps benefits from censorship. To some extent we don't ever fully understand Lolita or Humbert because we're never offered proof of the consummation of their feelings. Without so much as a subtle suggestion being tolerated outside of Lolita whispering to Humbert in the hotel room about a ""game"" she learned from the one boy at camp, the rest is left to imagination and so we can never truly understand why they are making certain crazed decisions. But that lack of tangible evidence does help us realize the power of Lolita, lust and desire as we see in the other characters. The raw tension that Kubrick creates in this subtlety does much to suggest the madness caused by these feelings and emotions. Ultimately, it is great direction that can turn a likely weakness into a commanding strength.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",Lolita
37,funkyfry,Kubrick's first really daring film misses only some of its marks,8,22 November 2009,"Marked by delicious dark wit, Kubrick's film version of Nabokov's ""Lolita"" stumbles only occasionally on its risqué subject matter. Featuring one heck of a performance by James Mason as the lead and a brilliant supporting turn by Peter Sellers, the film is to the politics of sexuality in America what ""Dr. Strangelove"" was to the politics of war.I only wish that a better actress than Sue Lyon could have been found. She often limits the scope of the film with her rather flat acting. Shelley Winters fairs somewhat better because she seems to understand the limitations of her character more, and thus plays her in a less self-conscious manner.When Sellers and Mason are on screen together, the film really takes flight. Mason truly seems disturbed by the energy that Sellers brings to the scenes, not just as a character but also perhaps as an actor. It's very hard to tell with such a talented actor as Mason. Sellers' character could be seen as a stand-in for Mason's libido -- he's sort of Mason's dark shadow. While Mason is a serious scholar of English poetry, Sellers writes quickly-forgotten TV melodramas. But he seems to have infinitely more success with Lolita, as if she mistakes his insubstantiality for something even more elusive, what she calls ""real genius."" This is the portrait of a man that I'm always leaving ""Lolita"" with, every time I see it -- he's a man practically intoxicated with his limitations and frustrations. He fails to recognize some of the rather basic aspects of the cat and mouse game that is romance, the sexual politics of the equation. Thus he tries to sneak into the bed even after having received a cot; when he finally takes himself off to this cold exile, he's rewarded in the morning by Lolita. Humbert Humbert never understands how to with-hold something or how to sacrifice in order to get what he wants; thus even with all the sacrifices that he does make, he never fails to bore Lolita. Clare Quilty on the other hand knows how to play these games.I don't feel that the film ever reaches its full potential, because the characters never fully come to life. We always feel that there's an emotional distance between ourselves and themselves. But it's a very daring film that manages to be both poignant and funny about a topic that was (and is) little discussed.",Lolita
38,Captain_Couth,The World of Stanley Kubrick: Lolita.,10,30 July 2005,"Lolita (1962) was a film Stanley Kubrick made right after he was finished with the epic Spartacus. Loosely based on the novel of the sane name, Kubrick turns the tale into a very dark comedy about a middle aged man (James Mason) who's deeply in love with a nubile adolescent girl (Sue Lyon). He even marries the girl's portly mother (Shirley Winters) just to be near her. But the marriage doesn't work and a strange man (Peter Sellers) enters the picture. Will this strange relationship ever work out?Kubrick defied a lot of taboos whilst working on this film. The very subject of this film is a major one. But a brilliant film maker such as himself can dance around the topic and still make it relevant. A plethora of dark humor can be found in this picture (i.e. Camp Climax) and the nonsensical names as well add to the film's charm. If you want to see a master director at work then I suggest that you check out Lolita.Highly recommended.",Lolita
39,jamesrupert2014,"Sly, provocative fable about obsession",9,17 July 2018,"In one of cinema's most sensual opening credit sequences, a male hand lovingly paints the nails of a woman's foot. The hand belongs to 40-something professor Humbert Humbert (James Mason, note that some of the odd names in the film are due to the narrative structure of the source novel), the foot to Dolores ""Lolita"" Haze (Sue Lyon), a precocious 14-year old with whom he is obsessed. Briefly, Humbert, newly arrived in America, rents a room from Charlotte Haze (Shelly Winters), a somewhat brassy but lonely widow. Humbert is initially repelled by Charlotte's fawning overtures, but accepts the offer of the room after seeing her beautiful teenage daughter sunning herself in the garden. Instantly smitten, he does everything he can to be around the girl, including marrying her mother. As his obsession grows, his behaviour deteriorates and he becomes increasingly possessive. Lolita becomes restless under his control, as she too has a secret. Given the permeating hebephilic sexual subtext, I am surprised that Vladimir Nabokov's controversial novel ever made it to the screen, much less with a minor in the title role (Lyon was 14 when the film was made, a mandated change from the 12 year old in the book). The film is less explicit about the nature of the relationship than is the book but I doubt anyone would conclude that it was not sexual. There are numerous sly innuendos scattered about (Lolita going to a ""sleep-over"" camp called ""Camp Climax"" is an unsubtle example) and Humbert's musing while writing his diary highlights his erotic obsession with ""every nymphet"". Mason is superb as the deteriorating Humbert, as is Lyon as the trigger and target of his passion. Despite being manipulative, self-absorbed, and fretful at times, Shelly Winters remains sympathetic as Lolita's mother, a lonely women shamelessly used by Humbert, whom (it is suggested) she really loves (she reads his diary, which earlier he states ""only a loving wife could decipher""). I was less impressed by Peter Sellers' Clare Quilty (a role expanded from the book), who came across more as an eccentric than loathsome. The acting, direction, script and score is uniformly excellent and my only disappointment with the film was the absence of the iconic shot of Lolita, with bright red lipstick, red heart-shaped sunglasses, and sucking on a cherry lollypop. IMO, that image makes for one of the all-time great movie posters.",Lolita

It's true.I can't begin to tell you how much this gutter-level, white-trash, Stanley Kubrick production made my skin crawl with complete revulsion. And, out of all of the characters presented in this story, there wasn't even one who was in the least bit likable.It was especially Sue Lyon's haughty portrayal of the slutty, demanding, snot-nosed Lolita character (as well as Peter Seller's slimy, quirky and totally irksome Clare Quilty character) that definitely lost this contemptible picture some significant points in my books.",Lolita
41,st-shot,Lolita's staying power still in evidence,9,30 November 2019,"Well in excess of being half a century old Stanley Kubrick's Lolita is nearly as fresh now as when it was first released in 1962. Featuring three outstanding performances and a biting acerbic script it remains a superb parody of American society without a hint of aging.Professor Humbert Humbert comes to a small New England town to teach French literature at a local college. He boards at a widow's (Shelly Winters) house with a nubile daughter, Lolita (Sue Lyon) and becomes infatuated with her, so much that he marries the mother to be close to her. Mom finds out but then ends up dead and Humbert blows town with his obsession. Shadowing them, Claire Quilty (Peter Sellers) who has passing interest in Lolita makes life miserable for Humbert.With a cast of unlikable and pathetic creatures Kubrick does an excellent job of maintaining our interest as he creates sympathy for a pedophile and let's you take delight in Quilty's sarcastic but hilarious torturing of Humbert. His mise en scene is both crisp and informing (the school play scene being a perfect example) and filled with minor characters who feed into the ambiguity and amorality of the story.Probably the most challenging role of his great career James Mason's Humbert is little more than a sophisticated degenerate in his pursuit of Lolita. Yet in spite of pursuing his illicit passion he manages to evoke sympathy as he deconstructs under the diabolical machinations of Quilty. It is a role Mason carries off with aplomb and arguably his best. Kubrick is said to have turned Sellers loose on the Quilty character allowing him to improvise free style and he makes a perfect foil for the flustered Mason. Doing a variety of characters he steals moments from Mason having a career day while at the same time giving emphasis to it and his plight. Shelly Winters is tragicomic sharp while Lyon's title character acquits just fine.Kubrick's most restrained and underrated film, its subtle satiric jabs just as sharp as the ones to be found in his next picture, Strangelove.",Lolita
42,GiraffeDoor,"For those who wish to burn the book or worship it, we have a solid picture here.",7,30 April 2019,"A straight forward and intriguing drama that takes Nabokov's postmodern exercise and reduces it too a simple (but elegant) story of a man who wants something more from life and his struggle to get it.Mason plays Humbert with a suavity and charm that belies a vulnerable core that is much more sympathetic than the sociopath of the original novel.Done in a cool, almost off-hand yet stylish fashion that is not above getting seductive, it is at once gleeful and eerie in its smouldering inter-generational romance. it's easy to root for Humbert as he tries to pursue the forbidden fruit in a petty bourgeois purgatory and the effect is subtle, effective and never lascivious.The sultry performance of Lolita is presented with a sophistication and feather touch that makes her the centre of the picture but appropriately not the focal point.As good an adaption as you could hope for that honours the original story but makes it its own. Whether the premise entices you or repulses you there is much to like here.I wish Kubrick had stuck to just directing other people's screenplays. That's where his talent lies. Oh well.",Lolita
43,MaxBorg89,"A stunning, unexpectedly moving analysis of love, longing and jealousy",10,22 July 2007,"When the film Lolita is mentioned, it is fairly common to assume it is a movie about pedophilia. In reality, there is nothing further from the truth: Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's novel is one of the most gripping depictions of love and its tragic consequences.That the story is tragic is evident from the prologue, where an Englishman (James Mason) coldly executes the whimsical Clare Quilty (Peter Sellers) after asking him if he remembers a certain Dolores ""Lolita"" Haze and what he did to her. Mason's character then starts narrating the events preceding the murder: it all started four years earlier, when he, Humbert Humbert, a Literature professor, moved to America for work-related reasons. While looking for a house, he met a widow named Charlotte Haze (Shelley Winters) and her daughter, the 14-year old Lolita (Sue Lyon). Inconveniently fascinated by the young girl, he accepted to marry Charlotte just so he could be close to Lolita, entering a new phase of his life based on lies and forbidden desires, all of which got much worse once the mysterious Quilty showed up.What kind of role the latter plays, I cannot reveal. However, I can say that Sellers almost steals the whole movie, his layered and consistently surprising performance being an outstanding anticipation of that masterclass that was his triple act in Dr. Strangelove. With his sleazy attitude and quirky voice (reportedly based on the director's) he comes close to distracting from the movie's core: the relationship between Mason and Lyon.The reason why said relationship cannot be classified as ""pedophilia"" is that Kubrick implies but never shows anything, leaving it to the viewer to decide. It could be something perverse, or it could just be a normal father-daughter connection, only with the father being a little more protective than usual: it's all subjective. This is also why the bond between Humbert and Lolita is more affecting than expected: however bizarre the professor's behavior may seem, his feelings are sincere. He is not a monster who is compulsively drawn to underage girls, he just happened to fall for one by mere chance, and Mason portrays this weird mentality with a tenderness that nearly makes one forget how ""wrong"" the whole premise is supposed to be. Lyon does a good job too, transforming from promiscuous sex-kitten to loving stepdaughter with a conviction that is rarely seen in such a young actress, making the passage look natural and unforced.In the end, as always with Kubrick, his films demand viewing after viewing as there is constantly something new that we didn't notice the first time. In the case of Lolita, the main pleasure derives from how the story is told: sometimes films about love and sex are much better without any explicit scenes, the multiple interpretations making them fresh and re-watchable decades after they were first released.9,5/10",Lolita
44,JasparLamarCrabb,Nabokov by way of Kubrick...heavy on the Kubrick,10,20 February 2009,"How did they make a movie of LOLITA? Very well. Stanley Kubrick's black comedy based on the Nabokov classic is a masterpiece of discomfort. As Humbert Humbert, James Mason is given the rare chance to carry a film and he's more than up to the task. His tragic infatuation with his landlady's daughter is played for queasy laughs. Never has an actor been made to sweat as much in a comedy! Sue Lyon makes a perfect Lolita, the only rational person in her life and Shelley Winters is priceless as her culture vulture mother. Kubrick was the master at presenting life's grotesques and he holds nothing back, particularly as his camera lingers on Mason while Humbert realizes how much he's degrading himself, with one immoral misstep after another. Guilt is personified in Peter Sellers (playing one character in various disguises). He's off screen for a lot of the time, but Seller's shadow(s) linger. A real work of art, filmed mostly in the UK but set in the US.",Lolita
45,smatysia,Well-deserved classic status,8,23 April 2001,"Well-deserved classic status. Pretty risque' for 1962, but then, Nabokov's novel was especially so for 1955. I get a kick out of a lot of the sexual innuendo that you have to pay attention to in order to get. Like the ""noodle"" remark. I think, though, that it was a mistake to put the ending at the beginning. I can't help but to compare this film with the remake from a couple of years ago. First, Humbert. James Mason did a very good job with this role. However, so did Jeremy Irons. Mason's Humbert was such a normal sort, even if European, that his obsession with Lolita is basically inexplicable. Irons' Humbert looks a lot more like a sick-o, you can believe him as a pedophile. In spite of the very different take on the character, Irons was quite good as Humbert, too. I'd give the trophy to Mason, though.
Sue Lyons was great. She was almost a perfect nymphet, albeit rather too old. In neither film did the makers have the guts to portray Lolita as she really was, about 12. (Yes, Nabokov's Humbert was a truly sick puppy!) But aside from her age, she had the perfect match of bratty, childish behavior with the coquettishness of a just-blossoming woman. And she was very beautiful, definitely an eye-catcher. Dominique Swain turned in a good performance in the modern remake, but she couldn't quite compare to Lyons. It's too bad Lyons couldn't have made the film now, when there are fewer constraints placed on such material. Shelley Winters was also very good in her role as Charlotte Haze. I thought Melanie Griffith was a bit miscast as Charlotte, though she did quite well.
Peter Sellers did a remarkable job as Clare Quilty, but I very much disliked his/Kubrick's treatment of the character. Frank Langella did much better playing Quilty as the utterly dissolute libertine. I realize that there were more constraints in 1962, but Sellers' Quilty just came off as excessively weird, and gave little hint as to his motivations. Overall, I prefer Kubrick's Lolita to Lynne's, but they are both worth seeing. Grade: A",Lolita
46,rooprect,I was expecting to hate this movie...,8,8 March 2020,"No exaggeration: when I popped this movie in, I was expecting to last maybe 30 minutes before ejecting it into the trash. That's how much I had already made up my mind that it was junk, based on things I've heard from other people, as well as the scandalouos ""immorality"" of the story (which was quite unnecessarily hyped in the promos and silly trailer that I watched). I was all set to hate this movie worse than Refer Madness.But immediately the opening scene changed things, and if you're like me with a chilly opinion, unsure if this movie is worth the rental fee if not 2 1/2 hrs of your life, I recommend that you find the opening scene on youtube or wherever and watch it. It's a great taste of everything that is to come.The opening scene sets up the movie as a flashback. In this scene we get a showdown between two men, ""Humbert"" (James Mason) who is shown to be a handsome, well dressed gentleman with a proper British accent; and ""Quilty"" (Peter Sellers) who is shown to be a sloppy, slurring (yet charmingly humorous) drunk. The opening scene masterfully mixes dark tension with just enough playful wit that tells us the film isn't taking itself too seriously. Really, if you want to know how this 2 1/2 hour film is, just watch the first 10 minutes.The story of ""Lolita"" is about a college professor (Mason) who develops an illicit infatuation for a teenage girl ""Lolita"" (then-15-year-old Sue Lyon). The movie does not really get into the psychological subject of paedophilia. The book gets deeper into that stuff, depicting Prof Humbert's past and the psychological twists that make him attracted to someone as young as Lolita. But in the movie, we get a straightforward tale of infatuation--forbidden of course--but essentially no different from any other love story.This was a gamble on Kubrick's part. By presenting it as, more or less, a normal love story involving a ""normal guy"" (I put in quotes because this phrase is cheekily repeated throughout the movie for effect) we the audience momentarily drop our morality guard, and we start to see things through the eyes of the ""normal guy"" Humbert who falls in love. Mason's charming style--with subtle elements of wounded puppy dog--further make us sympathise with him rather than confront the creepiness of the tale. It's a gamble because if you're unable to drop your morality guard, you may interpret this presentation as condoning or even glorifying what Humbert does. But I assure you, that's not the case.For one thing, there is absolutely nothing explicit. There are no sexual scenes shown, and probably the most erotic scene you'll see is during the opening credits where we see a closeup of a man's hands as he paints a female child's toenails. Seriously that's as racy as it gets, so if you're worried about a sexually explicit experience similar to Kubrick's ""Clockwork Orange"" then put those fears to rest. This film is closer to a George Cukor experience (""Philadelphia Story"", ""Holiday"") with hints of Hitchcock (""Shadow of a Doubt""). Humbert's relationship with Lolita is shown to be obsessive, controlling and sometimes fatherly, but never really sexual.Additionally what makes this film interesting is its use of humor. Peter Sellers takes the cake for that, as his character Quilty--a thoroughly despicable man--injects a wonderful blend of creepiness and comedy that you just have to experience. Fans of ""Dr Strangelove"" (done in 1964 two years after Lolita) will recognize the early makings of the Sellers's Strangelove character in a creepily hilarious scene where Sellers pretends to be a German-accented psychologist ""Dr Zempf"" attempting to school a perplexed James Mason on the disease of ""repressed libido"" in young girls. Like the opening, this is another defining scene of the film because it takes a very creepy, dark subject but handles it with just enough satirical humor that we aren't disgusted--but at the same time we sort of are. When you suddenly realize that these are two 40+ year old men discussing the sex lives of 15 year old girls, heck yes it's creepy. But the way it's handled here with dark comedy and irony, you may find yourself laughing out loud.Lolita (1962) is the kind of film that doesn't hit you over the head with moralizing. We're left to do that on our own dime. Kubrick's Lolita presents a controversial story but then distracts you from the controversy. The plot itself has enough action, mystery and twists & turns to keep your mind occupied without considering the obvious morality elephant in the room. Kubrick and cast pull it off brilliantly.",Lolita

Mason was great and Sellers was once again fantastic in many roles like in the Dr. Strangelove. I think this is one of the Kubrick's weakest films and that says very much because this movie is pretty good. Maybe if he had more freedom he would've done it better.",Lolita
49,slokes,He Took Her From Crayons To Perfume,5,15 April 2007,"Strained and strange, Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of ""Lolita"" is his first foray into transgressive cinema, and one of the most legendarily bold movies of all time. Bold doesn't quite equal great, however.Humanities professor Humbert Humbert (James Mason) takes up lodging in the New Hampshire household of Charlotte (Shelley Winters) and daughter Delores ""Lolita"" Haze (Sue Lyon). Humbert takes a decidedly unhealthy interest in teenaged Lolita, and encourages a romance with Charlotte in order to bring the girl into his unfatherly bosom. As his relationship with Lolita proceeds, he sweats more and more society's prying eyes.The problem with ""Lolita"" as I see it is that Kubrick was never good with people. The characters in ""Lolita"" never come across as real, whether its Winters' over-the-top performance as Mom or Peter Sellers as the mysterious Clare Quilty, more a director's affectation than a real character as he keeps popping up at all the wrong times to play on Humbert's growing paranoia. Sellers is even doing Kubrick's voice, and seems to be a case of the director inserting himself into the film. Why else does Quilty keep reappearing?Kubrick made other films with broad caricatures that work fine, like ""Clockwork Orange"" and ""The Shining."" The problem with ""Lolita"" is it's a story that lives or dies on your acceptance of the players as real people, especially as it centers on a young girl's ruined innocence and a man's believable, willing descent into the role of victimizer and, eventually, victim. As a viewer, you need sympathy to make the experience of watching ""Lolita"" work, to make it as unnerving as author Vladimir Nabokov intended.The film starts off promisingly, hitting us with its gauzy early-60s flip take on suburbia, with the cha-cha-cha, summer balls, and Sue Lyon's fabulously knowing take on Lolita pre-seduction. Kubrick's black-and-white compositions are on par with his later ""Dr. Strangelove"", not to mention Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho."" Mason has fun as the man with the secret, communicating his passion to the audience while wearing the mask for Ma. Kubrick may not have been able to show Humbert and Lo engaged in more than a kiss on the cheek, but this forced restraint only adds to the film's cleverness, finding subverted sexuality in such things as eating a fried egg.""Lolita"" starts going wrong with the character of Charlotte, played by Winters as a petulant woman-child stifled by a retarded religiosity. Her character's story arc is the stuff of tragedy, but played for a cheap laugh. When she discovers Humbert's designs for her daughter, she is angry, of course, yet more at the daughter than Humbert, calling her ""miserable brat"" and ""little beast.""As the film develops, we come to share Charlotte's attitude toward Lolita. It is Lolita who starts the seduction, and Lolita who plays Humbert throughout, manipulating him with a casual cruelty that seems to justify his every perverted excess. ""I'm really sorry that I cheated so much,"" she says at one point. ""It's just the way things are."" The only hint of collateral damage is the film's last image, a portrait of a young girl with a gunshot burn on her cheek.That's not quite giving away how the film turns out; that's one of the film's first images as well. Kubrick's usual devices (narrator's voice, circular plot design) are out in force and a comfort to his many fans for sure, but they don't add to the experience for those of us outside the club. ""How did they make a movie of 'Lolita'""? was the film's famous tagline, but Kubrick seemed at a loss as to why, and it shows.",Lolita
50,EUyeshima,Diluted Cautionary Tale Benefits from Smart Casting and Kubrick's Cinematic Élan,8,17 April 2008,"There's always been a pall of prurience over Vladimir Nabokov's classic 1955 novel, and although the prurience was dialed down to mere naughtiness in the 1962 film adaptation, there is still that discomforting feeling of watching two pedophiliacs chasing after a very young girl. However, master director Stanley Kubrick wisely left out the book's more controversial aspects and entrusted the audience to use their fervent imaginations to fill in the action. This explains why the title character, a twelve-year-old nymphet in the book, has turned into a fifteen-year old screen siren played by an already anatomically developed, throaty-voiced Sue Lyon. The switch neutralizes some of the dramatic impact, but fortunately, Kubrick was able to elicit a quartet of fine performances to carry the story. Even though Nabokov is credited with the screenplay, Kubrick made a number of revisions to clarify the narrative flow and appease the censors. The result is far too long at 153 minutes, but it's still provocatively entertaining as it alternates between funny and eccentric. It's well worth seeing the caliber of Kubrick's cinematic work between 1960's ""Spartacus"" and 1964's ""Dr. Strangelove"".The film opens with a shooting which we soon realize is the story's inevitable climax. After that, we flash back four years to the arrival of Professor Humbert Humbert in a small town in New Hampshire. A middle-aged British lecturer of French poetry, he has accepted a teaching job in Ohio for the fall and wants to relax in what he envisions to be a quiet setting for the summer. Humbert rents a room from Charlotte Haze, a blowsy, fortyish widow with immediate designs on him. However, his eye is drawn to her sexy, flirtatious daughter Lolita. Things go awry when Humbert decides to marry Charlotte to be near Lolita. When his true motivation is discovered, tragedy occurs, and Humbert and Lolita set out on a most acrimonious road trip to Ohio. Complications multiply with the periodic appearances of writer Claire Quilty, who also faces temptation with Lolita. For those unfamiliar with the novel, the story takes a surprising twist toward the end.As Humbert, James Mason has the riskiest role, but he effectively manages to convey a dangerous sense of obsession throughout the film. Although his character is basically despicable, Mason still elicits a modicum of sympathy for his perverse weakness. Sue Lyon, fourteen during filming, not only looks right but also brings the necessary combination of precocious confidence and childish selfishness to the title role. You can see echoes of their taboo relationship between Lester and Angela in Sam Mendes' ""American Beauty"". Donning a variety of disguises as Quilty and sporting a flat American accent, Peter Sellers easily steals all his scenes with comic malevolence. The surprising standout is Shelley Winters' performance as Charlotte. Instead of overdoing the character's desperation as you would normally expect from the actress' outsized persona, she is comparatively subtle in conveying Charlotte's needy nature. The only significant extra with the 2007 DVD is the original theatrical trailer which plays up the book's controversy.",Lolita
51,caspian1978,40 years old and still sexy!,8,3 August 2002,"Did you notice that Lolita and Humbert never kiss throughout the entire movie! You get this strong and very forbidden relationship between the two, but you never get to see it on camera. With the many long faded out breaks throughout the film, you get the feeling that everything that you are not suppose to see is happening off camera. An amazing film, only Kubrick could make. Having been around for 40 years, it hasn't lost its sexual flavor by any means. Strong acting from both Peter Sellers, James Mason, and Sue Lyon, it has yet to be topped in any sequel or related movie based on the same plot.",Lolita
52,valleyjohn,Why have the comical Sellers character?,8,30 May 2020,"I'm going to say something that Kubrick fans and are not going to like. I think the 1997 remake of Lolita , directed by Adrian Lyne is a far superior film. Granted , i saw the remake first which may have had some influence but i am adamant it's a better film.I'm not saying this version is bad , its not. In fact its really good but there are some real problems with it and they are mainly down to one person - Peter Sellers.
His character Clare Quilty is so over the top . It's like there is a character from the Goon Show inserted into a serious drama and it feels wrong in every way. Why Kubrick felt this was necessary is beyond me.
Frank Langella played Quilty in the remake and got it spot on. No childish voices or Pink Panther esq disguises.James Mason is superb ( That Voice!) as is Shelley Winters and Sue Lyon who played Lolita.
You have to admire Stanley Kubrick for making a film in 1962 with such a controversial subject . It was a brave thing to do.
Sue Lyon plays the innocent ( or not so) teen brilliantly and i love the subtle looks she gives Humbert .
The question is , is she encouraging him or is he just a sexual predator ?Despite my thoughts on the remake being a better film , i still think this one of Kubrick's best.",Lolita
53,TheFearmakers,Stanley Kubrick's LOLITA led by Sue Lyon,9,23 May 2020,"Between Stanley Kubrick's financial gig as glorified cameraman for Kirk Douglas's SPARTACUS and what's considered his most masterful dark comedy DR. STRANGELOVE is the subtle yet brilliant LOLITA, perhaps his most conventionally filmed and least visually offbeat since the story alone takes care of all that...A middle-aged English-imported college professor, played by James Mason, falls hard for Sue Lyon in the title role, whose mother, Shelley Winters, rules the first act almost entirely, running around a suburban East Coast American dream house, more frantically smitten with Mason's Humbert than he surreptitiously lusts for the dream-to-nightmare teenage daughter...Lyon, with full lips just evolved from a playfully puffy, baby-face scowl, has wide yet sharpened eyes guiding this literal performance of a lifetime as she'd quickly age/experience thereafter: a sensually timeless time-capsule of devilish chaste enveloped in what's Kubrick's very own sporadic road movie...Wherein lies shadowing and shady, often hilarious and perfectly annoying antagonist Peter Sellers who, like in STRANGELOVE, plays a number of roles albeit in one man... playwright Clare Quilty...Out to snake the girl from her smitten step dad, whose guilt, greed and vengeance has already overpowered him during a quirky prologue showdown between Brits: making Lyon's LOLITA not only the anticipated lead, but what everything leads to, means, and completely matters throughout.",Lolita
54,truemythmedia,Nabokov and Kubrick,8,13 June 2019,"I must admit I'm surprised by how much I enjoyed this film. It was a book that I thought would be impossible to bring to screen (even the tagline for this film was ""How'd they ever make a movie of Lolita?""), but Kubrick and Nabokov have done it in a way that is both classy and disturbing, thought provoking and humorous. While I can't say this film measures up to the brilliance of the book itself, it's certainly a worthy adaptation. For some people, I'm sure the themes behind this film could be very hard to stomach, and I absolutely understand why; this isn't a film I would recommend to everyone. Know your limits as far as content goes. This film is tame as far as what it shows on screen, but what it implies is grotesque; that's the point. This is a portrait of a man who is incredibly broken and twisted; it's sad to watch as he destroys his own life, and that of the girl he professes to love.",Lolita
55,davidmvining,The anti-Spartacus in every conceivable way,7,26 November 2019,"This is the anti-Spartacus. Where Spartacus was about the pure ideal of a man sacrificing himself for the good of humanity, Lolita is about a selfish man-child who kills the man who stole his under-aged sexual conquest from him and dies in prison. Spoilers, I guess.It's obvious that Kubrick struggled through the filming of Spartacus, and one of the ways that he dealt with that frustration was by buying the rights to and writing the script to the unfilmable novel Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov. It's almost a mirror image of the film that was giving him headaches every single day.Humbert Humbert is a British man of mediocrity who has made enough money off of a translation of some French poetry to vacation in a small New Hampshire town. As a home owner is guiding him around her house, hoping to convince him to rent her free room, it's obvious that Humbert wants nothing to do with her. He tries to extricate from the situation several times until she virtually drags him into her backyard where her fourteen year old daughter, Dolores, is sunbathing. Immediately Humbert is very keen on staying, and her mother, Charlotte, has no clue as to why. She's a dim, earnest woman who is desperate for attachment, mostly physical, with a man.The infatuation Humbert has with Dolores, nicknamed Lolita, is screamingly obvious, but neither Charlotte nor Lolita seem to notice. Charlotte is so overcome with her physical infatuation with Humbert that she can't see any faults and Lolita is simply too innocent or unconcerned at the beginning. As the summer progresses, Charlotte sends Lolita to camp for the rest of the season and Humbert agrees to marry Charlotte after he reads a confession she wrote for him (that he laughs through) outlining her love for him. He's happy to take advantage of the situation to remain close to Lolita, giving him a permanent place near her for when she returns from camp. Charlotte dies in what is somewhere between an accident and suicide when she finds Humbert's diary that describes his real feelings for the ""cow"" Charlotte and his love for Lolita.Freed from the shackles of any remnant of a traditional family, Humbert essentially takes Lolita on the run, moving to Ohio for a couple of years before running across the country as he feels that his sexual relationship with this young girl is prone to be found out, especially by Clare Quilty, a writer of some fame that seems to follow them from place to place. Eventually, Lolita runs away for several years. When Humbert finds Lolita again three years later, she tells him that she was having an affair with Quilty as long as she had known Humbert and it was he who had taken her away, but that relationship is over and she has cast off the shackles of new love for the shackles of an older model of love in the form of a monogamous marriage with a nice young man. She's even carrying his child. Dejected, Humbert gives her all the money he has and runs off to find Quilty, killing him in his messy and cavernous mansion.Each time I see this film, I like it a tad bit more. It's certainly good, but I think it's a good bit from greatness, though time may change that opinion. I think the biggest little issue I have is that I don't find Peter Sellers that funny. Humor is extremely subjective (which is why I rarely try to critique it), but Sellers' performance as Quilty is amusing most of the time and far from hilarious which seems to undermine the amount of screentime he gets. I do think his bit as a German psychologist, though, is really funny.The bigger issue I have is with the treatment of Humbert. He's the protagonist and he doesn't grow at all. I have no problem with that (Lolita is the one who grows, and that contrast is handled really well), but the tone of the film is an ironic romanticism that centers around a sexual predator. It's hard to tell if the movie wants me to feel bad for him, and it makes an unusual viewing experience. He's a despicable monster, a mediocrity in his life, and unable to form anything remotely like a real relationship. In a movie built on irony, it's interesting to watch him completely spurn Charlotte but fall head over heels for Lolita because they share all of the same personality faults. They're both incurious about the world with very low tastes in art and with an inability to really follow what Humbert considers greatness. The way Lolita dismisses Edgar Allen Poe's poem that Humbert recites to her is exactly the same sort of behavior Charlotte would give. It's only their youth that differentiates mother and daughter. That character trait that makes him an immovable man child without any growth makes him interesting, but the movie's almost coddling of him feels a bit wrong. It may be intentionally ironic (especially with the romantic swells of music that come during his worst moments), but I'm not sure it's really successful.Lolita, though, is the character that really grows. She starts the movie as innocent as a fourteen year old girl sunbathing in a bikini can be, becomes knowledgeable about how to manipulate men, and evolves into the one person in the film who embraces the idea of family. Humbert walks into a family to destroy it for his own pleasure while Quilty happily dances around them to pursue nothing else than his own sense of pleasure. Lolita, though, ends the film in a marriage with a baby on the way and her inheritance (that Humbert, in a fair reading of his actions, stole from her for several years). They are off to Alaska to start a new life in a place far removed from the kind of life she had lead up to that point.I was in a conversation with someone a while back and this someone made the assertion that much of Kubrick's filmography was set against the idea of the family. The discussion was really around The Shining, but I couldn't help but recall that conversation as I rewatched Lolita. Trying to view the film through that lens, I could only come away with the idea that Lolita was, perhaps, an affirmation of family, but maybe it's more of a refutation of the refutation of the family. Humbert wants nothing but his own pleasure, and he destroys lives. Quilty wants nothing but his own pleasure, and he destroys lives. Lolita wants a family, and she eventually finds it, being used along the way. It's an interesting take, at least.",Lolita
56,Spleen,Both Lolitas are good,10,1 September 1999,"Someone commented that if you want to acquaint yourself with Nabokov's `Lolita' without actually reading it, the best you can do is to see Adrian Lyne's version.  This is surely true.  And, I might add, if you want to acquaint yourself with Nabokov's `Lolita' without actually reading it - to hell with you.  You don't stand a chance anyway.  Humbert's narration cannot possibly make it to the screen in one piece.  Kubrick, at least, made no attempt.  He even invents his own material, which Lyne is afraid or unwilling to do.Something about Lyne's authenticity is even shocking.  He opens the story in 1947, which is when the story in fact opens - yet everything looks jarringly old-fashioned, whereas Kubrick's indeterminate 1950s setting looks right. The bulk of the story might as well take place in the 1950s as any other time.  The crucial point is that the story cannot begin any EARLIER than 1947 - we need a post-war America with motels dotting the landscape. Humbert has little contact with contemporary culture; he only encounters the snippets of music and film that obsess Lolita, and he finds them unendurably vulgar.  Kubrick captures this very well.  There's this boppy little pop tune we never hear the end of - although most of the time we only hear it subliminally - for the first half of the movie, and it sounds like exactly the kind of tune that drove Humbert up the wall.Kubrick's cast is a strong one.  It's crowned by Peter Sellers as Quilty - and before you complain that we see too much of him, ask yourself what scene featuring Quilty could you possibly want to be removed?  Admittedly, since this is 1962, we have a Lolita who is merely sixteen - but maybe this isn't just because it's 1962.  After all, the book does two things at once.  It makes us understand perfectly why Humbert is attracted to Lolita - we see her through his eyes - while constantly reminding us that Lolita is not someone that we would be attracted to, ourselves.  Both are worthy goals, but when it comes time to film the book, the director must make a choice between them.  Kubrick picked a genuinely attractive, but still obviously young, Sue Lyon.  I can't fault this choice.  As for Humbert - well, here Kubrick was actually MORE daring than Lyne was.  Humbert Humbert is a sympathetic character who is also calculating, manipulative and - now and then - shockingly brutal.  James Mason allows Humbert to be all of these things.  This doesn't prevent him from being sympathetic.  The story takes care of that.It comes down to this.  What, exactly, does Humbert do that's so wrong?  Is it that he has sex with a minor?  Considered in itself this is the least of his crimes.  What's really wrong is the way he attempts to be Lolita's lover and guardian simultaneously, and, of course, he makes a hash of both jobs. THAT is what's essential to the story of Lolita, and that's what Kubrick transfers to the screen at least as well as Lyne.Having said that I must add that both versions are very good.  They're also different enough to scarcely even be competitors.  See them one after the other, if you like.",Lolita
57,onepotato2,Switch Lolitas gender & fans will line up to condemn it,3,30 November 2007,"I'm not a prude or a conservative but there's nothing in this material artful enough to raise it above salaciousness. Exactly how many reviewers here would describe a story about male on male statutory rape as ""tasteful and entertaining"" or ""pitch black"" comedy? The permissiveness of heterosexual men who rate this movie highly with a wink are the exact population who would describe the 'funny' story of a man molesting an underage boy despicable. So let me recalibrate your morality for you: This is because it IS despicable, and so are the events Lolita concerns itself with. Why is this topic fair game? Because hetero men have a warped but acceptable interest in deflowering underage virgins. I know hetero men, who have shared this fantasy with me. This is precisely like the crowd of half-wits insisting that the lesbian scene in Mulholland Drive is 'artistically necessary.' Ask them what art would require them to watch two guys doing it. It's not art... it's softcore titillation. Don't hide your horniness behind claims of 'art.'Leaving morality behind and evaluating the film on strictly entertainment grounds results in a mediocre review of an underwhelming movie. It's a fragment of a book, and it's humor is pretty trifling. I watched with an open mind but laughed about once. Is the tone of Nabokov's book really this silly?

It's the type of novel that seemed absolutely unfilmable back in 1962, but, somehow, the film did manage to get made, and it is excellent!Despite having very mature themes, Stanley Kubrick's ""Lolita"" is quite tasteful. Of course, it seemed extremely tasteless back in 1962, but over 50 years later it seems pretty tame and mild.While it is tasteful, it's still disturbing and even shocking in places, but it's also really funny. As a matter of fact, it seems more like a dark comedy than a romantic drama. The humor is scattered all throughout this film, and sometimes it's roaringly funny. Peter Sellers's performance is one of the funniest in screen history, and he's hysterical in the brilliant opening sequence. A lot of the film's humor is not only dark but a little unsettling, and very uncomfortable-it almost reminds me of an extremely tame version of a Todd Solondz film, like ""Happiness"" or ""Storytelling"".If there's any Stanley Kubrick film that deserves a little more praise, it's this one. So far, it's definitely within my top 3 favorite Kubrick films, and it's easily his most underrated one. Although it is fairly well known and well liked, it's not hailed as the masterpiece that I feel it truly is.

Kubrick was ""forced"" to make numerous cuts to it. This left him without the film he originally envisioned.

60,Kingslaay,Not bad,7,12 January 2020,"Lolita is a well made film. It is more relevant than you think. It touches on some controversial themes. A middle aged man becomes obsessed with a young girl. Often women faster than men, a lot faster and it is a primal instinct to be attracted to their developed curves. Such is nature and life. Society prescribes what is decent and indecent but primal instincts will always exist no matter how much we evolve. So when a female matures so quickly men find it hard to resist.A lot is left to the viewers imaginations to piece together the professor and Lolita's relationship. This could have been a very powerful and telling film. But restrictions at the time hindered so much. Even Kubrick mentioned had he known there would be so many limitations he would have never made the film. It is for this reason it does not achieve its full and powerful film. Despite this James Mason and Sue Lyon give strong performances. I also realise at the time of this review Sue Lyon (Lolita) only died a few weeks ago.

61,LeonardKniffel,Brilliantly Perverse,10,11 September 2020,"Director Stanley Kubrick has drawn a great film from an equally great novel, and such book-to-movie transformations are often not nearly so successful. James Mason, who is one of the best actors of the 20th century, is a marvel in the role of the perverse professor Humbert Humbert. Shelley Winters, whose cloying qualities often grate on the nerves, is perfect as the neurotic, delusional mother whose daughter is the object of Humbert's obsession. Sue Lyon, who was about 16 at the time she played Lolita, delivers an unforgettable performance as the sexy little nymph who turns into the most ordinary of women. ""Lolita"" is one of those stories (like ""The War of the Roses"") that takes obsessive irrational behavior to its logical conclusion in a surreal fashion. Although there are comical moments, this is a very sad film, and the movie's theme song is somehow as vapid yet unforgettable as Lolita's brain.",Lolita
62,bandw,A tragicomedy,9,14 January 2012,"The arc of this story of Humbert Humbert, an older man obsessed with a very young woman, is that of a tragedy, being that Humbert's obsession results in two deaths, a wounded child, and his incarceration. Given that synopsis you would think that this would be a heavy movie, and indeed it touches on serious themes, but Kubrick leavens the proceedings with humor. Consider an early scene that has Humbert, a culturally sophisticated European professor, looking for a place to stay prior to a lectureship in French poetry at a small New England college. Humbert winds up checking out a room in a house owned by a Mrs. Haze, a widower and cultural wannabe. You see that Hubert is desperately trying to escape from Mrs. Haze during the walk through, until he views the garden where he sees the voluptuous Lolita and immediately says, ""We haven't discussed how much."" That scene captures the tone of the movie. On the one hand I found it hilarious, but on the other it clearly sets the stage for the tragedy that is to come.Peter Sellers is at the top of his comedic form playing Humbert's nemesis, Clare Quilty. Kubrick capitalizes on Sellers' ability to play different roles in the same movie, as he brilliantly did in ""Dr. Strangelove."" The scenes that have Sellers talking to ""Mr. Swine,"" and later to Humbert, in the hotel are jewels. And his interrogation, as Dr. Zemph, of Humbert's sexual proclivities is priceless (for example, in referring to Lolita he comments, ""She either has exceptional control or she has no control at all. We cannot decide which."") Mason is well suited to play the sophisticated professor, though a tad old for the part I think. Shelley Winters is a standout as the lonely, sex-starved Mrs. Haze, and Sue Lyon is great as Lolita. Lyon may have been fifteen or sixteen during the filming of this, but she could easily pass for an older girl, clearly sexually mature. I think most men would find her attractive, the thing that separates most men and Humbert is that Humbert is so captivated that he is possessed to pursue the relationship.Several alterations were made to the book to soften if for the screen. For one thing, in the book Humbert is a clear pedophile with Lolita being pre-pubescent. This makes the story in the book much more problematic in terms of having much sympathy for Humbert. His behavior in the movie, while not acceptable by the standards of American society, is more easily understood. However, it is the case that both in the movie and in the book Lolita initiates the sexual relationship, and it is not her first. At the end of the movie when Humbert meets Lolita after several years absence, the married and pregnant Lolita does not seem like the damaged woman you might expect. She appears to have gotten beyond her experiences with Humbert and Quilty as well as could be expected.It is impossible to fully capture the verbal pyrotechnics of the novel in the movie and Kubrick has wisely chosen not to try that. The movie stands on its own as an independent work of art. Interesting that Nobokov is given sole credit for the screenplay, since Kubrick took great liberties with it. Kubrick noted that Nabokov's original screenplay would have taken about seven hours to run. Nobokov has written of the final screenplay, ""The modifications, the garblings of my best little finds, the omission of entire scenes, the addition of new ones, and all sorts of other changes may not have been sufficient to erase my name from the credit titles but they certainly made the picture as unfaithful to the original script as an American poet's translation from Rimbaud or Pasternak."" Nobokov thought enough of his screenplay to publish it some ten years later as, ""Lolita: A Screenplay."" Reading that only proved to me that consummate literary skill in writing short stories and novels does not transfer to writing screenplays.So, we have four Lolitas: this one, the Nabokov novel, the published Nabokov screenplay, and the 1997 film with Jeremy Irons. If not totally faithful to the novel I think this movie is alive and captures the spirit of the novel while the 1997 version, that follows the novel more closely, is rather flat and ponderous. The published screenplay ranks as the weakest treatment of the four.Kubrick can't seem to resist inserting a scene or two of slapstick, like the collapsing cot here, or the Coke machine in ""Dr. Strangelove."" I find those scenes quite out of place and disruptive of the flow. And why Kubrick put the final scene at the beginning, only then to go to a ""four years earlier"" script, is puzzling, since that scene is so wonderful it would have made a great coda. Kubrick should have saved his best stuff for last.I found the score by Nelson Riddle effective and memorable.One thing missing in the movie is an exploration of how some early childhood experiences influenced Humbert's later emotional makeup--it's like his sexual development got stuck in early adolescence.",Lolita
63,brogmiller,"""A vivacious variant"".",8,22 October 2020,"""Lolita. Light of my life, fire of my loins......."" These are the opening lines of Vladimir Nabokov's novel which depicts the sexual relationship between a middle-aged professor of French literature and a girl of twelve and a half.To attempt to film a 'faithful' adaptation was bound to be problematic. Film adaptations have always been notoriously difficult to pull off as the very nature of film demands so many compromises but here of course director Stanley Kubrick has the added headache of having to gain the approval of those self-appointed arbiters of public morals: The Production Code and the crackpot Catholic League of Decency.No need to linger here on the differences between the novel and the film as they are conspicuous and considerable.To make the film more 'palatable' Kubrick has cast Sue Lyon, a mature-looking fourteen year old, as Lolita and has made the character of Humbert, played by the superlative James Mason, far less seedy and unpleasant. There is little sexuality here but there is not much sensuality either which is a pity.Kubrick has chosen to make his film more comedic by expanding the character of the equally seedy and unpleasant Clare Quilty and casting Peter Sellers in the role. Kubrick has given Sellers' improvisatory skills full rein here and allowed him to don various disguises and employ funny voices. There are those who regard Sellers as a brilliant actor, others as merely a brilliant mimic. For this viewer at any rate the jury is still out. At one stage Mason expressed concerns that Sellers was stealing the picture but he needn't have worried. Mason reigns supreme in a part that other actors had understandably rejected.Another perfomance to treasure is that of Shelley Winters as Lolita's mother Charlotte. In the novel, upon hearing that Humbert teaches French literature her character utters the immortal words: ""I love the French tongue"". Such a pity that censorship denied Miss Winters the chance to speak that line!The delectable Sue Lyon's performance won her a Most Promising Newcomer award at the Golden Globes but her career thereafter was patchy and her private life deeply troubled.Although Kubrick later admitted that he would never have attempted to make this film if he had realised the constraints of censorship he would have to face, this remains nonetheless the work of a master film maker. The film's poster asks:""how did they ever make a film of Lolita?' The answer is, 'just about!' Although Nabokov laboured long and hard and is credited with the screenplay hardly any of it actually made it to the screen. Despite this he was still gracious enough to call the film ""a vivacious variant"". It is only fitting the author should have the last word.",Lolita
64,DeeNine-2,One of Kubrick's best,10,19 June 1999,"Among Stanley Kubrick's four great cinematic works--the three others: Dr. Strangelove...(1964), 2001, A Space Odyssey (1968), and A Clockwork Orange (1971)--Lolita (1962) is the most uneven, yet in some ways the most brilliant. The casting, from the improbable choice of Peter Sellers as Claire Quilty, to the exactly right choice of Shelley Winters as Charlotte Haze, to the beautiful Sue Lyon as Lolita, to the ""old world"" James Mason as Humbert Humbert, was inspired. The witty and intensely focused interpretation of Nabokov's black comedic novel was probably as true to Vladimir's spirit as the silver screen could hope to come, and yet the film was clearly and exactly a Stanley Kubrick work of art.The scene (apparently a Kubrick witticism) in which the dead Charlotte's friends find Humbert in the tub with a scotch and a hand gun, and mistakenly think he is about to blow his brains out from grief when in fact he is in jubilant celebration, is a wonderful variation on Nabokov's text, as is the use of Peter Sellers disguised as a Freudian shrink at the girl's school. However, I thought the Buster Keatonish slapstick improv with the folding cot at the Enchanted Huntress a bit overdone.Inevitably the recent Adrian Lyne film and Kubrick's must be compared. The photography in the Lyne film was superior, and Lyne more clearly demonstrated the tragic nature of Humbert's all-controlling obsession. Otherwise, Kubrick's Lolita is clearly superior both as entertainment and as cinematic art, mainly because it is free from even a hint of political correctness and passes no judgment.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)",Lolita

66,bobsgrock,Magnificent Obsession.,9,14 January 2009,"Stanley Kubrick begins his most creative spree as he moves to England after the debacle known as Spartacus and starts off with adapting Vladimir Nabokov's controversial novel about a man infatuated with a young teenage girl to the screen. If there was anything Kubrick was a master at, it was the ability to adapt novels to films. Here, it is never more apparent. Though I have never read the book, and though I know the film is quite different than the novel, I found this to be an absolutely engrossing picture that completely grabs you in and takes you on this disturbing and provocative journey. Yet even despite all the editing and contracting Kubrick had to do in order for this to pass the censors, I believe it only enhances the experience of watching this man as he continues down a path that can only lead to certain unhappiness and moral obscurity.For all the controversy and trouble that came with this picture, the actors certainly did their share. James Mason does something almost uncanny with this character of Humbert Humbert, a man so slimy and paranoid, there is no reason to like him; yet Mason is able to get us to almost sympathize for this man. Shelley Winters is magnificent here as the promiscuous widow who is set for tragedy. Peter Sellers is comical, as always, but Sue Lyons really surprised me with her ability to give a rather open performance of this girl who very much had psychological problems. Of course, with Kubrick behind the camera, the look and feel of the film is sly, subversive, and completely enhancing. No matter what your feelings on the subject or the novel, you owe it to yourself to see Stanley Kubrick's Lolita.",Lolita

68,gizmomogwai,A most uncomfortable movie,8,17 March 2010,"I've been enjoying seeing more of Kubrick's work and Lolita (1962) is the latest that I've seen. So far it's my least favourite movie of his, but that's not to say it's bad. Lolita is for the most part competently done, but Kubrick seems to have been still developing his skills. The subject matter- based on the famous book of the same title, which I've never read- is most uncomfortable. Here's a grown man sexually attracted to a young girl, somewhere between 12 and 14. Some things that may have been shocking in 1962 aren't now, but this is not one of them.Still, the movie doesn't show any actual intimacy between the man, Humbert, and the girl, Lolita. They do squabble like an older couple. These scenes actually reminded me of Citizen Kane (1941) where Kane's second wife complains about being lonesome; Lolita is feeling isolated by a ""father"" who won't let her out. This movie isn't heavy-handed in condemning the inappropriate relationship, but it sure doesn't argue their relationship was positive. Humbert is obviously a disturbed man, but he's our protagonist.Much of the movie is interesting but I was questioning other things. Why was Lolita's mother calling her a beast? She wasn't a particularly bad girl. There's an awkward scene where Humbert reads a love letter from Lolita's mother out loud. He's an educated man but he can't read silently? Nevertheless, I wanted to keep watching this movie right to the end. That's to Kubrick's credit.",Lolita
69,aciessi,Um..,9,31 December 2019,"Interestingly enough, I had no clue that the woman who played Lolita died just a few days ago.What's even more interesting is that I thoroughly enjoyed Lolita, a film that by any measure should have been uncomfortable and repellent. Kubrick took a serious novel and turned into a pitch black dark comedy . The word ""outrageous"" really comes to mind. Perhaps in 1962 audiences were naive enough to get behind this as a love story without thinking logically about who these characters are. But yet, it's still audacious in its existence, and somehow, Kubrick knows this as well. You can tell because of how unsympathetic he treats the protagonist, Humbert. On the surface, he's a dashing anglo intellectual with a piercingly affected accent capable of swooning any woman in his grasp, yet we become aware of the fact that he's a slimy, cretin. Kubrick thinks he's laughably pathetic, and he wants us to think that of him as well. That's kind of what makes Lolita, for a lack of a better term, acceptable as a narrative. At no point did I get the sense that the romance happening on screen was normal. That is precisely because Kubrick approaches the material comedically, as apposed to any kind of sincerity. The storyline gets even more absurd with the addition of Peter Sellers as Claire Quilty. A goofball college crank who at first appears as the white knight trying to save Lolita from Humbert's greasy clutch, only to be realized as another creep infatuated with her, and thus creating a sickening love triangle.Dark comedies need to approach tragedy with absurdity and ridicule in order to work, and by that effect, Lolita works. It works so well that I was close to giving it a perfect score, had it not been for the lagging nature of the last 30 minutes, which didn't give this story the punch it deserved.",Lolita

71,rebeljenn,a beautiful disaster/relationship film,7,18 January 2006,"'Lolita' is a beautiful film about a taboo relationship between a writer and a young girl in her early teens. This story evolves with their relationship, from their meeting and their running away together to helplessness. It's a deep, psychological film that seems just destined to end in a disaster. While Lolita is young, she has a manipulating mind, and she knows that she can use her sexuality in order to get what she wants. Meanwhile, the man who has his eye on her is willing to do anything just to be with her, and this even means marrying a woman that he does not love in order to be with Lolita. This is a beautifully-made film showing attention to detail and examination of the characters.",Lolita
72,bryank-04844,It's amazing to me how a story like 'Lolita' was ever made into a film.,10,12 August 2015,"It's amazing to me how a story like 'Lolita' was ever made into a film. Not only that, but it has been remade over and over again, with audiences still loving it. Don't get me wrong, I'm one of those audience members who loves 'Lolita', both the novel by Vladimir Nabokov and Stanley Kubrick's 1962 version of that novel. Hell, I even own one of the original French movie posters of the film, which is displayed in my house. But to make a film back in the early 60s with such a controversial taboo subject as 'Lolita' has, somebody somewhere had to make a lot of changes to get past the MPAA.Before 1962, Kubrick had already made a name for himself in film, with movies like 'The Killing', 'Paths of Glory', 'Fear and Desire', and 'Spartacus'. But 'Lolita' is usually the first film from Kubrick to appear in the never-ending box sets since the first one came out on DVD more than fifteen years ago. The main reason for this is that this is where Kubrick started to become bigger than life and able to take total creative control of his films. Something that Kubrick was a stickler about and usually turned out that his adaptation of whatever novel he was making, turned out better than the book itself. And that is something very rare.But with 1962's 'Lolita', Kubrick still had to fight and curve around studio execs, actors, and producers to get this movie made, because of the intense subject matter. Kubrick went on to say that if he had to do it over, he probably wouldn't have made the film since he had to constantly jump over obstacles and change his vision to make the censors and executives happy. The result is surprisingly still an excellent film, but is far different from Nabokov's novel from 1955. Kubrick even had to change actors, because the actors he had asked were too scared to take on the roles, because of the controversial subject, which was basically pedophilia.So Kubrick had to re-work and re-write the script, which is much more comical than the book, but left the sexual innuendos and sex scenes to the viewer's minds and thoughts, rather than show anything remotely of the sorts. Needless to say, Kubrick was very cautious with making 'Lolita'. The film starts out with the end of the movie as we see a man kill another man in cold blood. We flash back several years before this incident where we meet the killer, who is Professor Humbert Humbert (James Mason) who teaches at the local college. He is looking to take in a vacation before he heads back up to the university for the school year and comes across a woman named Charlotte Haze-Humbert (Shelley Winters), who owns a big house where she rents out rooms.This pushy woman entices Humbert to come stay at the house where he is reluctant to do so until he sees Charlotte's young daughter Dolores or 'Lolita' (Sue Lyon) for short. Humbert immediately falls for the very young Lolita and decides to stay in the house. In Kubrick's film version, we see the Humbert is simply a man in love, but it is a forbidden love since the girl is so young, but in the novel, Humbert has a wide variety of problems, which give way to his creepy and unnatural infatuation with Lolita. A couple of mishaps and accidents happen, leaving Humbert and Lolita together as they travel across country from hotel to hotel where they pose as father- daughter by day and lovers by night. Meanwhile, someone keeps popping up wherever they go, usually in different disguises.This person is Clare Quilty (Peter Sellers), who usually throws a nail into Humbert's plans for Lolita. But this all builds and shows us what led Humbert, a man of questionable morals, but respected by everyone to kill a man. Kubrick, in order to appease the execs and producers, as well as make an excellent film took away the aspect of Humbert's motives for loving a much younger woman and instead put that focus on Lolita.What is supposed to shock us, never ultimately does, and instead things play out comically with excellent performances by everyone involved. Still, it would have been interesting to see if Kubrick were to make this in the late 70s or 80s, if it would have been a much different and more disturbing picture than it was back in 1962. Perhaps we will never know.",Lolita
73,EijnarAmadeus,The ever-darkening Lolita.,9,11 August 2009,"Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's 1955 novel of the same name takes on the topics of obsession, sexual repression, fame and lost love. The film takes on a risqué topic, of an adult man who falls desperately in love with an underage girl and uses her mother to come closer to her. Now, back in 1962 censorship were considerably stricter (as we all know) than nowadays, so Kubrick used all the tricks up his sleeve to subtext the boiling sexuality of the plot and its marvelous characters; notice background designs or props, even clothing and make-up, and most significantly the dialog, full of innuendo. James Mason portrays professor Humbert fabulously, his desire for the young Lolita and the way he sneaks into getting to know her, the drama in his acting and the way he tears up throughout the final act is brilliant, and he's also got a good comic timing; and speaking of comedy, Peter Sellers, do I have to say more? The man is arguably the funniest actor the world has ever seen, as far as I know. He is a complete genius in the way he takes on the scenes, his subtlety and his dryness is one-of-a-kind; his dancing steps at the summer dance, his raving about Spartacus, or his great chat about ""normal..."" - he delivers one of many classic performances in a Kubrick film. In the part as Lolita we find the lovely Sue Lyon, who sadly hasn't enjoyed growing actor success, and in the part as her mother, the fine Shelley Winters - all sexually famished and desperately lonesome. It's a foursome of acting that's full of sparkles, drama and energy.And now, Kubrick never took on a film without exploring the darker side of it; and the same is with 'Lolita' - what's obviously an obnoxious topic, goes even deeper with its satire and dark heart in finding undercurrent layers of pedophilia, pornography and nymphomania. It's pretty vulgar, but Kubrick constructs it so elegantly and with such a masterclass carefulness only he could.",Lolita
74,elvircorhodzic,"""Quilty! Quilty?""",8,19 May 2017,"LOLITA is a black comedy drama, which, in an unserious way, examines serious psychological problems. It is based on the novel of the same name by Vladimir Nabokov.The film begins with the verbal conflict between the two men. One man is drunk and maybe stoned, his opponent is desperate and angry. Their conflict has ended with a tragic outcome. The film then flashes back to events four years earlier. A distinguished professor arrives in Ramsdale, New Hampshire, intending to spend the summer before his professorship begins at Beardsley College, Ohio. He has found a room to rent at a house of a cloying and sexually frustrated widow. The professor becomes infatuated with her overly flirtatious daughter. He has married a frustrated widow, in order to stay close to the object of his desire. However, their ""daughter"" is in a summer camp for girls. He lives with her mother, forced to fulfill his conjugal duties. He becomes more withdrawn, and his brassy wife more whiny. She discovers his diary entries detailing his passion for her daughter...This film can be seen as a sort of a social incident. This should not be reduced to the relationship between a perverse underage girl and middle-aged man, who has disturbed libido. All characters are somehow disturbed and unhappy. That is perhaps more important for this story. It is very difficult to recognize the love and passion as emotions among the main protagonists. Simply, this is a tragedy with comic and ironic reflections on a very important psychological problems, which are a reflection of a subjective society.This is not a shameful review of something disgusting. This is an inappropriate fun, which is decorated with a very strange styles and a pretty good acting. Characterization is very good.James Mason as Humbert ""Hum"" Humbert is mentally unstable and obsessive-minded man, who comes from the quiet love phase to the phase of the jealousy, confusion and despair at the end. Sue Lyon as Dolores ""Lolita"" Haze is a spoiled and lonely brat, who has to grow up very quickly. Her feelings are absolutely vague. She, practically, is not ready for some major life decisions, even though Mr. Kubrick has made, from that fact, a contrast with her stepfather at the end of the film.Peter Sellers as Clare Quilty is a cunning and dark artist. He is a disturbed reflection of Humbert's character. His mystical and patchy appearance is almost outstanding. He is a thread that connects a killer and a victim in one figure.Shelley Winters as Charlotte Haze-Humbert is an unhappy mother, a widow ... wife. She is a woman who looks for love at the wrong address. It was obvious from the start.This is too serious to be fun, but it's fun.",Lolita
75,AhmedSpielberg99,Comfortably Uncomfortable!,8,20 August 2019,"Something feels terribly wrong and quite unsettling; I'm extremely riveted, and not offended at all!This is exactly what I feel while watching a film by Paul Thomas Anderson, David Lynch, Yorgos Lanthimos (I've only seen The Lobster, though) and Darren Aronofsky. All of these filmmakers can incredibly turn their pervert and sick films to some otherwise digestable and very interesting films. That said, there's no one ever who's better than Stanley Kubrick in doing that (PTA is right after him).I'm not saying that because Kubrick is my favourite out of the aforementioned directors; it's actually the exact opposite. I've never been the biggest fan of Kubrick's works, and the fact the only of his films I didn't like are his arguable masterpieces, Dr. Strangelove and 2001, is the strongest proof. However, one of the few things I liked about these two films, and I've found in all of Kubrick's films, is exactly what Kubrick does best: creating some sort of attractively disquieting and ambiguous atmosphere (don't ask me how or what does that even mean) that I simply couldn't resist even if the film itself bored the hell out of me.For this reason, I think there's no better choice than Kubrick to adapt a novel that deals with a taboo subject matter such as Lolita. But why didn't I, and clearly many others, find the result to be perfect?Unlike the majority of people, I didn't hate that Kubrick took sort of a lighthearted comedic approach to the story. In fact, I don't even think that's 100% true. I'd rather calling it a camouflage than an approach. Lolita is a drama film through and through; it has a pinch of black humour, which gives the film a very unique and refreshing tone. In doing so, with the help of Kubrick trademarks (including visual and narrative innuendo and an unsettlingly seductive music), Lolita maintains the edge that distinguishes the novel, I suppose.I have to admit, though, that the film struggles to keep this lighthearted tone a mere camouflage. As I think that at some point, the film really became kind of a dull lighthearted, and even sometimes a slapstick, comedy that all of its jokes fall flat. As a result, the film isn't constantly sharp.Maybe it would've been better if the first sequence had been cut off. Not only because the film is a bit overlong (I was thoroughly enjoyed, though), but also because I don't believe it was necessary to begin with the final chronological scene. I mean, I was absolutely curious to know how this film would end this way, but I'm positive that that didn't add anything important to how I perceived the story.The acting is simply top-notch. All the performances are outstandingly brilliant, especially from Sue Lyon who played the titular role. And all the actors are perfect for their roles, especially James Mason who played Humbert the middle-age lecturer. I mean, he has the most normal-looking face, as Clare Quilty described him. By the way, Peter Sellers stole every single scene he is in. He's definitely a very talented actor, but Kubrick really know how to use his talent perfectly and like no other director does. I'm sure Rick Sanchez is inspired by Clare Quilty more than Back to the Future's Emmett ""Doc"" Brown. Well, at least regarding his voice and manner of speaking! Shelley Winters is also great.Lolita is by no means a perfect film that definitely doesn't feature Kubrick at his most mature filmmaking. But it's a an intense, solid depiction of tragic transgression that has everything Kubrick is good at, and would be great at later.(8/10)",Lolita
76,MattyGibbs,Stands the test of time,9,12 November 2016,"I watched this for the first time recently. I can't say I'd ever had the desire to watch it previously but from the first scene it draws you in and you want to know what happens. It's a long film and at time it seems a little too slow moving at times but a first rate cast make this a must watch film. James Mason is simply outstanding as Professor Humbert who quickly becomes infatuated with Shelly Winters young teenage daughter Lolita. Sue Lyon is superb as the young temptress Lolita and it's a surprise she didn't go onto better things. There is a typically surreal but nonetheless impressive performance by Peter Sellers as Clare Quilty. Although this tackles paedophilia it's done in a very understated way with everything very much implied rather than shown. This if anything adds rather than takes away from the films effect. This is rightfully classed as a classic being beautifully filmed, scripted and acted. A must watch for anyone with an interest in movies.",Lolita

78,virek213,The Impact Of LOLITA,8,5 April 2006,"The advertising line for this film's release in mid-1962 was ""How did they ever make a film out of LOLITA?"" The obvious answer is, of course, that ""they"", namely maverick director Stanley Kubrick and his producing partner James B. Harris, had to do it very carefully, given the scandalous nature of the Vladimir Nabokov novel they were adapting to the screen, with the author's help. Some, of course, would say that they didn't go far enough into the erotic and sexual nature of the story about a craggy, middle-aged man named Humbert Humbert and the ultra-nubile teen Dolores ""Lolita"" Haze, and thus they have taken to Adrian Lyne's far more explicit 1998 remake. But those were the rules in Hollywood at the beginning of the 1960s, though this film helped to change all of that.Even with these restrictions in place, and despite a running time of slightly over two and a half hours, however, LOLITA still manages to work wonders as a quirky mixture of road movie, romantic drama, and underhanded black comedy. This is largely due to Kubrick's canny choice of casting. James Mason, well known in America for his roles in the 1954 version of A STAR IS BORN and as the villain of Hitchcock's NORTH BY NORTHWEST, does a fine turn as the devious Humbert who marries Charlotte Haze (the late Shelley Winters, in a deliciously off-kilter performance), for the sole purpose of being nearer in more ways than one to her daughter Lolita (Sue Lyon, in an impressive screen debut). After Winters' death by car, Mason thinks he'll have Lyon all to himself. But with that mysterious man named Clare Quilty (Peter Sellers) on the scene, such is not the case.Kubrick can only hint at the eroticism and sexual perversion of the novel, which caused an uproar upon its publication, but I think this works to the film's advantage, allowing the audience to guess and think in their minds what else is going on between the sheets, perhaps allowing for a 'PG-13' rating by our standards today (this in contrast to Lyne's remake, which is much more explicit and graphic). Many people have argued that Lyon was a couple of years too old to play a nymphet here, but again those were the Hollywood rules of the time. Her performance nevertheless captures that fairly typical combination of seductiveness and brat-like American teenage behavior; and that very first shot of Lyon sitting on a towel in the backyard in a bikini and sunglasses can't help but be an iconic shot. It is also a big reason why the name Lolita would become synonymous in later years with almost any sexy teenage girl who had a penchant for seducing men two to three times as old as she she is. Sellers' Clare Quilty, who dons various disguises to keep Mason's Humbert off balance, generates much of the film's shady humor, and the glossy black-and-white cinematography of Oswald Morris is superlative.One other thing that really doesn't get discussed all that much about Kubrick's LOLITA is the music score here, one of the last times Kubrick would do it this way. After Bernard Herrmann turned the director down (being told that he would have to use a theme by the producer Harris' brother Bob), Kubrick turned to Nelson Riddle, famous for his work with Frank Sinatra in the 1950s and with Linda Ronstadt in the 1980s during the last few years of his life, to do the score, and Riddle delivered a fabulous one, very much like the one Herrmann might himself very well have composed. It is lush and romantic without being too syrupy or giving too much away.If the censorship restrictions of its time mean that LOLITA is something less than an erotic masterpiece, so be it. And as with every film Kubrick would make from this film clear to his last one, the eerily similar EYES WIDE SHUT, LOLITA requires multiple viewings for people to catch each nuance. But it is well worth the experience.",Lolita
79,davidcarniglia,Humbert Humbug,8,4 July 2018,"A daring drama, full of irony and nutty relationships. At the center would be Lolita, very well portrayed by Sue Lyon. Shelley Winters, as her mom Charlotte, sees her more as a rival than as a daughter. She jealously calls her ""a homely child."" On the other hand, James Mason, who could be a surrogate parent to her, wants Lolita as a lover.Charlotte's problem is that she's stuck at the same emotional level as Lolita. She says she still ""feels young"" but has become a pretentious bore with her ""Van Gawk"" Van Gogh. Humbert's relationship with Charlotte is an ironic inversion of his affair with Lolita. He could care less about Charlotte, but uses her to get closer to Lolita. As much as he adores Lolita, she uses him to suit herself.Her character can't really be faulted. She's certainly aware of the effect she has on guys of all ages; but she's a confident outgoing teen who likes to have fun with people...sometimes a little too much fun. Humbert knows exactly what he's doing, even if he doesn't know why. We don't get to see what his ex-wife was like, so we don't know why he ends up in strange relationships.He must be miserable when he's with Charlotte, and he's never really secure with Lolita either. Even if she weren't underage and technically his stepdaughter, she's so mercurial she would annoy him anyway. In some ways, though, she's the most mature one. She's a little unsure of herself, but isn't afraid to try new activities, and fits in well with all of her peers and mentors (Humbert being a special case, to say the least). Her most poignant line ""I want you to be proud, really proud of me,"" even though it would better said to her mom instead of Humbert, shows that she feels good about herself.By the end, she's very much a young adult. She still seems cheery, even with the huge responsibility of marriage, running a house, and carrying a baby. In these rather desperate circumstances, one has the impression that she'll be fine. Strangely enough, when Humbert comes to visit, he seems to almost fit in. He's given the respect due to an older relative who's also a benefactor. But she wisely refuses to junk everything and run off with him.The one who seems out of place is Peter Sellers. He tends to throw the drama off-track with his idiosyncratic characters. The scene at the hotel when he pretends to be a cop is especially distracting. It's amusing for a few seconds, but he just goes on and on. He's a sort of grotesque foil for Humbert. I don't see the point of the frame story either. Why would Humbert kill him? Sure, he's a 'rival' of sorts; but by this point, Humbert has seen Lolita settle down permanently. Every guy but her husband is banished to the fantasyland she once lived in.Another bit I couldn't figure out was why Humbert would wait to tell Lolita that her mom was dead. It seemed unnecessarily cruel to make up a story about her being in the hospital. It's also odd that Lolita spends the total of one night grieving.Anyway, a really well-made film on a difficult topic with some fine performances. 8/10.",Lolita
80,WriterDave,Opportunity Missed,7,24 January 2006,"Somehow, even though I am an ardent fan of Kubrick, I didn't see this film from 1962 until just recently. It certainly was worth a look, though it definitely ranks among Kubrick's lesser films and explores themes he readdressed in his last film, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" over thirty-five years later. There are some classic Kubrick scenes in this flick, like the pan down from the bedroom into the kitchen after Humbert and Mrs. Hays get into a fight, or when Humbert is visited by ""friends"" while soaking in a bathtub after his wife's tragic accident, and of course the iconic scene of Lolita lying on her stomach on the bed in the hotel playfully cocking her head back and forth at Humbert and then slipping off her shoes.How much you can tolerate Shelly Winters' whining and James Mason's overt perversions will make or break this film for you. You also have an even more perverted Peter Sellers doing his typical man of a thousand disguises bit that just never seemed right to me in this film. The actress playing the title character made little Lolita come across as a sniveling brat with nary the seductive properties so overwhelming in the novel. Due to the social mores of the day, Kubrick really wasn't able to channel the aching lyrical poetry of Nabokov's controversial tale of older men lusting after a nymphet. Here, Kubrick, always the sly master, guises the sexual deviances in two polarizing ways: at times he plays the film like a comedy of manners (especially in the Sellers' scenes which become all the more disturbing because of what he is trying to get at from all the comedic shenanigans), and at other times the film is a formulaic and staged melodrama. The shifting tones are interesting, but don't really work, and then the film literally ends mid-scene with Mason's Humbert finally tracking down Seller's Quilty and all the viewer is left with is an anti-climactic epilogue. All in all, an interesting film to view in the context of the time it was made and against Kubrick's other works as a thematic whole, but definitely not the classic you thought it could be and a missed opportunity to fully tap into Nabokov's art.",Lolita
81,Jithindurden,Kubrick makes you despise yourself,9,6 December 2017,"With characters that appear sympathetic at the beginning and turning more and more despicable as the film goes on and showing the unstable mental condition of the main character without throwing it at your face, Lolita manages to keep you uneasy throughout the film. Kubrick's attempt in dark comedy is highly successful here which he will perfect in a much more comedic Dr Strangelove. Lolita could have been a much more complexly woven tale if not for the censorship of the time. From what I've heard the original novel is much better and a lot are omitted here which makes this looks like more sided with the character of Humbert but the way I see it Kubrick have made the audience uneasy and to an extent made them despise themselves for sympathising with these characters by the end of the film. He never wants everything to be too black and white which is what I believe he tried to implement here as well.",Lolita
82,asda-man,The trials and tribulations of an old posh man,8,13 March 2015,"I've never read the novel of Lolita so I can't comment on how much of the film is censored or toned down. I have of course heard of the various cuts Stanley Kubrick had to make in order to keep the censors happy, so perhaps it has slightly lost its power? Nevertheless, what we're left with is a consistently entertaining little film about a man falling in love with a girl who's barely a teenager. I was very impressed with how the film managed to portray the relationship without even showing the couple kissing. In fact, the cosiest the pair come is when Lolita grabs James Mason's hand whilst watching Frankenstein in a drive-through.Whilst the film is a hefty 150 minutes it never manages to bore. It is far longer than it needs to be and has some repetitive scenes which add very little to the overall experience, however I found myself always engrossed in what I was watching. I particularly enjoyed the first half which deals with James Mason hopelessly trying to start a relationship with our young nymphet. There are some darkly amusing encounters including some funny slapstick with a cot and a plot to murder the landlady.The film is of course marvellously directed. It has the look of an early 60's film, but the feel of something much bigger than that. Stanley has some lovely, inventive camera moves and the framing is always brilliant. Sue Lyons was also very magnetic in the role of Lolita. She kind of reminded me of Audrey Horne in Twin Peaks, there's an innocent side and another side of a smouldering temptress. I was less impressed with James Mason as the one-dimensional bumbling, boring Englishman.Lolita is a fantastic film and shows a steady progression from Paths of Glory. However, I still wouldn't think at this stage that Stanley would have it in him to direct something as sensationally enigmatic as 2001: A Space Odyssey. This film certainly shows that Stanley loved a challenge and was willing to push Hollywood's conservative boundaries. With Lolita he pushes them with style and entertainment. It may be a little wordy and long, but most films were like this in the 60's.Read more dazzling reviews at www.asdaman.wordpress.com",Lolita
83,cinematic_aficionado,Worth watching,8,25 April 2004,"Lolita in my opinion is a film about passion obsession and how we allow them to rule or ruin our lives.Lolita has a very good cast and a good director so from the writing credits one should expect a good movie, and actually watching it will not let you down. Quite the opposite in fact. It is enjoyable, funny and mysterious.Watching the end of the film in the start guarantees an undiminished interest throughout.Another I liked about this film is that unlike its remake there were no obscene sex shots or any rudeness of any kind.A very good movie. 8/10",Lolita
84,bregund,Just finished the book...what a wild ride,10,12 October 2014,"If you've never read the book, you're missing out on a brilliant work. I've watched and loved the film over the years, and after reading the book I don't think anyone could capture Nabokov's astonishing wit, cynicism, sarcasm, socio-political proclamations, eye for excruciating detail, or lengthy ruminations on his adoration for ""nymphets"". There are a few horrible details that would never make it into any mainstream film, but Kubrick certainly captured the spirit of Humbert's indefatigable obsession with a twelve-year-old girl. For the reviewers who are whining that this film is ""tame"", how in the world can you portray the hilariously horrible couch scene from the book without the film looking like porn? Kubrick had to leave out some stuff.Some might criticize Peter Sellers's prominent role in the film, but the book actually reveals that Clare Quilty was there all along anyway, so his presence in the film is simply a fanciful interpretation. All those witty lines in the film? They were lifted straight from the book, word for word. And I'm almost convinced that Nabokov was thinking of Shelley Winters when he wrote Charlotte Haze; no other actress could have filled those shoes.Please read the book, it is a literary marvel that will change your life.",Lolita
85,FrenchEddieFelson,A controversial masterpiece,9,26 April 2019,"Inspired by the eponymous novel (Vladimir Nabokov, 1955), this film admirably describes the sulfurous relationship between a middle-aged writer and his nymph Dolores Haze, aka Lolita.By chance, looking for a furnished rental, the professor Humbert Humbert encounters Charlotte Haze and her beloved daughter Dolores. From the very first sight, the professor irrevocably accepts the rental conditions! A triangular relationship settles quickly between 1) an intellectual sensitive to beauty and youth, 2) a desperate widow impressed by this professor, both unable to fight against theirs own obsessive desires, and 3) a manipulative and nonchalant teen. Consecutively to a fatal accident and because of the inquisitive and invasive look of Clare Quilty, the teacher will progressively and ineluctably descend in the depths of the abyss.James Mason is awesome and monumental. He is also excellently seconded by Sue Lyon, Peter Sellers and Shelley Winters. And Stanley Kubrick is definitely a regular of successful and even improved literary adaptations, with Shining (1980), 2001, A space odyssey (1968), Barry Lyndon (1975), A clockwork orange (1971), The Killing (1956), ...This movie is truly a masterpiece.",Lolita
86,SkullScreamerReturns,A review about the glasses and an actor that aren't in the film,5,2 June 2020,"Those heart-shaped glasses, that's an image everybody knows...But what else do you know about the movie?I start with funny misconceptions I had:
I thought it would be in color (nothing wrong with black and white tone - but that menas no red glasses in the movie, disappointing!)They weren't even heart-shaped! What! I've been deceived!I thought the movie was from 70's or 80's (probably confused with the 90's version)I expected Harrison Ford would be in it. Why? I really don't know where this idea came from. Maybe confused with ""Sabrina"" because it's a similar female name...?I don't know what kind of movie I expected but not this. The weird and surprising plot made me feel like I'm watching a Hitchcock movie...but not as good.Then the characters, they were all weird or irritating. Maybe that's intentional. A psychologist might make interesting diagnoses from these characters.
Humbert: starts sympathetic but becomes more and more delusional. That's the most interesting part of the film because I know the feeling when you hold on to some thought or emotion even if it's totally ridiculous...but can't admit the bitter truth to yourself.Lolita: I don't get her intentions, though it's understandable because teenagers can be all over the place. She's supposed to be the dream girl that the guy falls in love with but I think she's annoying. I would just run the other way fast.-Quilty: Weird character with weird intentions, and especially weird because he's played by Peter Sellers who is always too weird.
The mother: goes bananas.I don't know what's the morale of the story if there is any. There's potential for a psychological drama but somehow I felt like it doesn't boil down to anything. It's just mad characters doing bad decisions and weird stuff happens. I don't know. I'm still disappointed that there weren't heartshaped red glasses.",Lolita

And anyone thinking that there is no such agenda being perpetrated here is more naive than any 12 year old virgin.This society has become so warped and twisted that it doesn't even recognize pure abomination when it's staring it right in the eye. The real question here isn't how did they ever make a movie of Lolita...but why. And the answer is quite simple -- because pedophiles exist in the world and in Hollywood; they have an agenda; and this fiasco is the fruits of their labors.

88,avik-basu1889,A weirdly funny film about a disturbing subject !!!,6,15 December 2015,"'Lolita' is a controversial Stanley Kubrick film based on an even more controversial novel by Vladimir Nabokov. Nabokov himself co- wrote the screenplay for the film along with Kubrick. The plot follows a European professor named Humbert Humbert who relocates to an American suburb. He rents a room from a lonely window Charlotte and then comes across her young teenage daughter Lolita. He ends up feeling an instant attraction towards Lolita. Humbert ends up marrying Charlotte with the sole intention of being close to Lolita and pursuing her. This attraction towards Lolita slowly and gradually becomes an obsession which engulfs Humbert and pushes him over the edge and into a state of paranoia and constant jealousy. The original novel which I have not read, was considered to be a hugely controversial piece of work as the disturbing nature of the storyline was taboo and far too risqué for the fifties. The film could have been even more controversial as this was the adaptation of the controversial story on the screen in the visual medium. But Kubrick used interesting and subtle ways to hint and imply certain things without actually being explicit about them. I think I noticed an underlying theme of two cultures coming into contact. There is Humbert who is the European who goes to America to find a home and work. He comes across an overly sexed up society of the upper-middle class, but he is only interested in the young Lolita. In a twisted way, Humbert's obsession for Lolita could have been used to symbolise the European immigrant's desperate attempt to own and be a part of America's future. The atmosphere and environment that surrounds the characters is messed up and filled with lust and greed and manipulation. Every character is pursuing someone else with a fair share of lust, but it is Humbert's pursuit of Lolita that gets the attention because of her age. A sex crazed and obnoxious society similar to this one was also present in 'A Clockwork Orange', another Kubrick film.Having said all that, overall I don't think the film is supposed to be analysed and scrutinised so minutely. Kubrick treats Nabokov's story almost like a comedy. There are so many sexual innuendos and euphemisms which will remind you of sex comedies like 'American Pie' and 'Eurotrip', there is a significant amount of slapstick comedy, there are the antics of Peter Sellers,etc. All the aforementioned things makes me believe that this was meant to be a comedy even though it deals with pedophilia, a very sensitive and disturbing issue.I think Kubrick's career as a filmmaker can be divided into 2 parts: the pre Dr. Strangelove era and the post Dr. Strangelove era. I think from Dr. Stangelove onwards, Kubrick managed to distinguish himself from the other filmmakers and created his signature Kubrick style. Along with Dr. Strangelove, all the subsequent films that he directed can be easily identified as Kubrick films just by looking at any random scene. 'Lolita' is a film from the pre Dr. Strangelove era of Kubrick's filmography and so it does not have that distinctive Kubrick touch and feel that all of us love. The only film that he made before Dr. Strangelove that I love is 'Paths of Glory'. 'Lolita' is a good film, but it didn't have that wow factor that you get from other Kubrick films. Kubrick tells the story well, but the style is very reminiscent of the other Hollywood films of the late 50s and early 60s. It didn't have a lasting impact on me. It's a very standard noir-ish film, the likes of which became very popular during that era of Hollywood filmmaking. To finish, I will have to say that 'Lolita' is certainly not one of Kubrick's best films. It is technically well made, the plot moves briskly and the pacing is good as for a 2 hour 30 minutes long film, it didn't seem to overstay its welcome and it has a good performance from James Mason. However, it didn't overwhelm me and it didn't linger in my thoughts for too long. It's good, but not 'Kubrick good'.",Lolita
89,rooee,"Lovely, lyrical, lascivious",8,12 April 2010,"Lolita: that ""lovely, lyrical, wilting name"". After Nabokov's novel and Kubrick's film adaptation, the name Lolita has, unfortunately, become synonymous solely with sexual precociousness. Really, we should add 'vulgar' and 'brash' to that synonymy - the real Dolores Haze (Sue Lyon) is brusque, and anything but wilting. She's known by two names; she leads two VERY different lives.Given the reputation that follows the tale of Lolita around, it's sometimes easy to forget how funny this first (and best) film adaptation is. With Kubrick, we're in the hands of a master satirist. So when Lolita is shipped off to the hilariously named 'Camp Climax', her emotional farewell embrace with Humbert Humbert (James Mason) is cut short with what amounts to a snappy ""see ya"" before the camera swoops over our troubled anti-hero as he gazes longingly over the banister, full of yearning and repressed passion, while melodramatic music swells like something out of Gone With The Wind.Humbert is an amusingly sardonic sort when he knows he's going to get what he wants; he's stroppy when he can't. So, while we're never offered any backstory to help us build a psychological justification for Humbert's infatuation, we can clearly see that his passion brings out the teenager in him: fickle, randy, playful and obstreperous.Shelley Winters marvellously over-plays Dolores' lonesome mother, the actress's alleged poor treatment by the director pre-dating Shelley Duvall's by almost 20 years - and, similarly, it could be argued the performance is improved accordingly.This was Kubrick's first collaboration with Peter Sellers (who plays the writer Clare Quilty). Like Dr Strangelove, there's an exhilarating unpredictability whenever the chameleonic Sellers occupies the screen. This was the first time Kubrick encouraged improvisation - it's partially this, I believe, which elevates the film to the status of the first true Kubrick classic. Paradoxically, with Lolita we're able to see the control Kubrick would wield thereon; he arrests the image, moving the actors with the precision of chess grand-master, shooting everything from the beautiful to the banal with sublime artistry.",Lolita
90,mdm-11,Middle-aged professor falls under spell of teenage temptress,8,22 May 2005,"Ever since the enormous success (and controversy) of this film, we have added the term ""Lolita Syndrome"" to Webster's Dictionary. The term refers to the obsessive attraction an older man has for a very young female (usually a minor under law).James Mason plays Professor Humbert, who seeks temporary room and board at Shelley Winter's house in order to concentrate on writing his novel. Undecided about the accommodations, he suddenly sees Winter's seductive 12-year old daughter Lolita (played by a slightly more mature Sue Lion) and now MUST stay.Over the next several weeks Mason hopelessly falls into lust and adoration with the ever-teasing Lion, while Winters develops similar feelings for Mason (who at first is oblivious to his amorous effect on the lonely widow). A sudden twist of fate keeps Mason around, allowing for the poor fool to deteriorate emotionally, leading to his total insanity.The character played by Peter Sellers is equally pathetic, but Mason reminds of Emil Jannings in ""The Blue Angel"", where he portrayed the sad ""Professor Rath"" seduced and ruined by the temptress ""Lola"" (Marlene Dietrich).Although enjoying worldwide controversy back in 1962 as today, Stanley Kubrick's ""Lolita"" is not entirely true to Vladimir Nabokov's novel. Twisting some of the characters into completely different people than Nabokov had intended, Kubrick made this another true Kubrick creation. Nabokov did receive credit for scripting. The catchy score adds a nice touch!",Lolita

Sue Lyon as Lolita (2 years before she would be ""A Lolita: in The Night of the Iguana), does a fantastic job in role.Shelly Winter (as Charlotte Haze) is the best thing about this move - she's the best thing about any pre-1975 movie she's in (The Night of the Hunter, A Place in the Sun being brilliant). Add James Mason as Humbert Humbert, a name fitting of a creep so utterly obsessed with Lolita to the absurd point of self-destruction.Peter Sellers in a humorous turn as both Clare Quilty and Dr. Zemph, which we learn was Lolita's true love at the end. It's hard to watch Sellers in this role and disassociate him from Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, where he also plays multiple roles. His performance doesn't quite fit the mood - too comedic - too Sellers.For Kubrick fans, you've already seen it. For old move fans, it's def worth a watch.

92,rlcsljo,Kubrick on the way to becoming KUBRICK,8,13 July 2000,"I must admit, I was shocked when I saw this film.  Not for the subject matter, ""Pretty Baby"" does a better job on this, but the fact that Stanley actually made a movie with some semblance of a plot!  I rented this film after years of curiosity expecting a disjointed plot with lots of symbology and actors with little apparent motivation.  You can imagine my shock, when I found out that most of the characters were in fact human, three dimensional and complex, except for ""Quilty"".  This film needed to be made later (I haven't seen the remake), when standards were loosened considerably.  If you are a Kubrick historian, this is a very interesting chapter in his long history.  By the way, Sue Lyons must be the girl they invented the word ""babe"" for--The shot of here in her bikini is worth the price of a rental.",Lolita
93,GeorgeRoots,"Let's Be Honest, There All Perverting Each Other In Some Way...",8,19 June 2014,"It was mentioned around the 1990's with ""Eyes Wide Shut"", that Kubrick had wanted to make a film about sex since the 1960's. I also remember reading that when Kubrick and Producer John Harris finally had their hands on the novel ""Lolita"", one would tear the page out for the other they were so eager to read it. Controversial for the time would be an understatement, but how well does it hold up today? Well I can't help but say some of the controversial subject matter feels a little dated. No I don't mean the paedophile aspect, I mean the idea of a girl her age wearing that kind of clothing being considered scandalous after seeing what some girls actually wear 50 years on. I'd imagine half these shots coming straight out of ""Vogue"" or something, possibly echoing Kubrick's career at ""Look"" magazine.Well the only problem I had with this movie is the length and pacing. It is without doubt a slow one, yet I think it helps James Mason's character appear more human, albeit extremely flawed. Hopelessly he indulges her, and in return she knows how to get exactly what she wants. Sue Lyon, Peter Sellers and Shelly Winters shine in the time they have, and in the end everyone gets their individual comeuppance. That is the plot in a nutshell, again whether the source material was more risqué I've yet to discover.In the age of the Internet and all you hear about is how extreme some sexual predators can be, and as a man born in 1992 I find it harder to see how this movie could be considered so controversial outside of the era it was made in. What is clear however is that Kubrick shoots wonderfully, and having the church literally condemn your movie of course it wouldn't be able to go very far (Stanley himself said had he known how strict the rules were, he wouldn't have made it). I admire the gusto in which Kubrick had attempted any sexualised work, whereas world cinema at the time such as Federico Fellini's ""La Dolce Vita"" (1960) had never had such problems (Although the Church condemned that film for entirely different reasons). Considering that the original author Vladimir Nabokov, along with Kubrick wrote the screenplay, it definitely shows both men were putting in their best effort.Final Verdict: Controversial yet dated. Only Kubrick could have pulled this off, and in that sense fans of Kubrick will most likely enjoy it the most. I definitely recommend it. 8/10.",Lolita
94,barberoux,Constrained,8,24 October 2002,"""Lolita"" is a constrained movie.  Constrained by the mores of the times. Charlotte Haze's pushy sexuality was broadly hinted at and stealthily portrayed with some boob pokes.  Much was left to the imagination and long fade outs and pauses allowed your imagination to run wild.  Lolita was not as sexually forward as in the novel but Sue Lyon still came across as a sexual, and predatory, creature.   Excellent performances by James Mason, Shelly Winters and Sue Lyon.  Peter Sellers was good as Quilty.  Also Miss Moneypenny makes an appearance.   James Mason played Humbert Humbert as a somewhat obsessed, creepy person who payed for his sins with the pain of rejection.  Somewhat slow at parts but worth seeing.",Lolita
95,christian94,Great Kubrick that loses a bit of steam at the end,7,15 January 2004,"This film is more than aptly directed by the master of cinematographic precision.  The performances are great, especially the quirky Peter Sellers, and the screenplay comes to life with subtle humour and sarcasm.  I was in fact shocked of how funny it was.  A lot of undertones and innuendos, mixed with a captivating plot line.  However, the richness of the first 90 minutes start to wear off as the characters seem to only go through the motions for the last hour.  Perhaps the film should have been shortened to a screentime closer to 2 hours and a bit, but I think that the main problem lies in the screenplay which has presented all the right elements and knows where its heading, only does not seem to do so in a cohesive, well-paced and fulfilling matter.Still a good pic and a good pick, but Kubrick will do even better in the future and will become Great and larger-than-life like his movies.",Lolita

97,thenolanfan,Review - Lolita,8,6 August 2020,"An amazing movie, and a beautifully transcribed screenplay. The implication of Vladimir Nabokov who is also the author of the original novel surely is responsible for a good part. Nevertheless, Kubrick has a gift to translate books on the silver screen.Its perfectly handled camera movement, pacing, and subtlety. Lolita this movie is truly great. However, Peter Sellers' character is poorly introduced, his appearances tend to unbalance the tone.One of the excellent aspects of this film that I didn't raise in the preceding paragraph is the performance of Sue Lyon who stole the show. It is quite tragic how her character's situation can be associated with her own family, Sue Lyon's dad died when she was 10 months, and her mom took care of Sue alone. Anyway, her performance deserved an Oscars nomination. In fact, she would have deserved to win Best Actress in a Supporting Role.A little different from Kubrick's usual style, but still a must-watch for movie fans.",Lolita
98,jonathanruano,Lolita,8,27 September 2009,"When Stanley Kubrick's Lolita first came out, it stirred a lot of controversy. Today, much of the movie seems tame, and yet the subject matter of Lolita - a relationship between a middle-aged literature professor and a twelve-year old girl - is something that we remain reluctant to talk or write about. Is Humbert Humbert's (who James Mason plays brilliantly) love for and obsession with Lolita(Sue Lyon)evil? Or are they truly human emotions? That is the intriguing question that Kubrick's Lolita poses and rightly leaves for us to answer. This is a movie first and foremost about love; and it tells this story largely without passing judgement on any of the characters concerned.I will not spoil the plot, except to say that Kubrick's Lolita is a touching, emotional film. Mason is fine actor and the screenplay really does show him at his best. Sue Lyon does a good job too and, although she later regretted doing the film, it was actually a good thing that she did agree to play Lolita at that time. Probably one of the most inspired performances, though, comes from Peter Sellers whose Claire Quilty is truly magnificent. You can also see Lois Maxwell (who played Money Penny in the James Bond series) in a much smaller role of a nurse toward the end.",Lolita
99,darkreignn,How did they ever make a movie of Lolita?,9,16 November 2018,"The tagline of this film was something along the lines of ""How did they ever make a movie of Lolita?"" The answer to that seems to have been by making it, at least for the first half, as much of a comedy as possible. At first this unexpected tonal shift, especially when compared to the very disturbing and dramatic aura that encapsulates the novel, took me by surprise, and I have to admit I was initially disappointed; I wasn't expecting a story about a manipulative hebephile to be played for comedy. But the film was entertaining enough, so after a while I found myself absorbed in it, and to be honest, it's hard not to be absorbed in a film that looks this good and that is as well-acted as this one.Kubrick is a master behind the camera, that can't be denied. And even though ""Lolita"" is one of his earlier films, his skill can't be ignored. Sure, it may not have the fluidity of ""The Shining"" or the dazzling spectacle of ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" but it is filmed with a certain meticulousness to it, where every event feels almost like it was destined to happen, a self-fulfilling prophecy, if you will. Now maybe I'm reading too much into the movie, but even without this pseudo-philosophical viewpoint, the film looks good, and the acting is great.Sue Lyon is riveting as Lolita Haze, the object of Humbert's desires. What I found interesting about her performance is that, even though the actions of Humbert are repulsive, as a grown man should know better than to sleep with a 14-year-old girl, she is just as, if not more so, manipulative as Humbert is. Except where Humbert's actions seem to come from a place of painful desperation, where you can see the self-hatred in his face, Lolita acts with malicious intent, somehow succeeding in taking advantage of the man who is attempting to take advantage of her; she becomes the predator, and poor Humbert the prey. Lolita plays Humbert like a fiddle in this film, and this unexpected switch of dynamics was one I found exceedingly interesting, because instead of feeling bad for Lolita, I found myself feeling bad for Humbert, who reveals himself to be just a lonely, pathetic man, in the end.Humbert just can't seem to stop seeking his own destruction, and from the beginning of the film we know he has come full-circle, we just don't know how yet. Throughout the course of the film, however, Humbert makes every single wrong decision that further pushes his own life into disarray. And even though the man is, by any sensible sense of morality, not necessarily a good person, you really can't help but feel bad for him. And I think this is a testament to Kubrick's skill, because he not only makes you sympathize with a child predator, but he even goes as far as to turn the child into the actual predator, in a way. And when the film finally gets to its ending, and the story of Lolita and Humbert concludes, it was one of the saddest things I've ever witnessed. Because through it all, through the depravity and degradation, the least you can hope for is for a happy ending, but the movie doesn't even give you that. It begins, and it ends, with desperation being channeled through destruction.So the acting is good, the plot is riveting and plays both Humbert and us for fools, Stanley Kubrick is the best director in the history of mankind, and the movie bastardizes the book - you get it, this is the best film of 1962, but what are some negatives? Well, since you've asked, I'll tell you. For one, I honestly think the film could be longer. I feel like relationship between Humbert and Lolita should've been more developed. I mean, he really just falls in love with her immediately, it's love at first sight for Humbert, but that really wasn't enough, at least in my opinion. I mean, he sees her and the next few scenes are him trying to hold her hand or look at her while she's playing outside. I understand the concept of love at first sight (Hell, who hasn't even experienced it for themselves?) but I simply wish there was a bit more development in this regard as to exactly why Humbert was so attracted to Lolita.Also, I found the pacing to be, lackluster, to say the least, for the first half of the film. The movie seemed to just bounce from scene to scene to scene, at times without rhyme or reason, even incoherently. But as the second half of the movie came rolling in, the film became much more coherent, and the pacing much tighter, and the film was better for it, becoming ultimately more suspenseful as a whole.All-in-all, Stanley Kubrick's ""Lolita"" is a damn great film. There's so much to think about, so much to analyze, that I fail to see why anyone wouldn't like the movie, even if it is radically different from the novel. But if you take the movie as a separate entity from the novel, there's no reason why you won't enjoy it.",Lolita
100,galileo3,Kubrick's little masterpiece,7,9 December 2007,"Lolita (1962)Top 5 - 1962 Stanley Kubrick's 'Lolita' is an unusual delight, a sort of sexual comedy/drama, that is both funny and tragic at times. Kubrick's later revisited the subject of sexual obsession in his final masterpiece 'Eyes Wide Shut'.This early film by one of the masters of cinema, has James Mason playing Humbert Humbert, a European Immigrant, who falls for his landlady's 14 year old daughter, with that lovely, lyrical name 'Lolita'. Humbert marries Lolita's mother, so he can keep alive, his perverse sexual obsession. The story evolves from there...Peter Sellers, the legendary Peter Sellers plays a minor role as the playwright who destabilises the life of Humbert, Lolita and her mother.Kubrick's film is a roller-coaster of emotions, laughter and mixed feelings. This is a fine film,, but nowhere near to some of the director's greatest works (2001, Shining, Eyes Wide Shut).This film is almost like grand Shakespearian tragedy, love betrayal, obsession, told by one of cinema's most interesting personalities.7/10",Lolita
101,hasosch,The dissimilarity of Doppelgängers,10,26 December 2009,"In Nabokov's ""Lolita"", the protagonist is Humbert Humbert, his Doppelganger is Clare Quilty, a man with whom he shares no resemblance at all. In Nabokov's ""Despair"" (filmed in 1978 by R.W. Fassbinder), the protagonist is Hermann Hermann, his Doppelganger is Felix Weber, and again, there is no resemblance. In both cases, outer similarity between two persons seems to be unnecessary because they are less Doppelgangers but Alter Egos - and as such projections of the mind. It is quite unclear what Lolita means when she tells Humbert that she never loved someone more than the sophisticated writer Quilty, because she has nothing to answer when Humbert asks her back about the quality of her love for him. Humbert does not realize that she betrays him with himself - as little as Hermann seems to be aware that his wife Lydia betrays himself in the shape of her cousin Ardalion: another dissimilar Doppelganger of Hermann Hermann? A highly interesting question that has hardly even been brought up comes from that scene where Humbert waits at the front desk of the hotel, why Lolita is up in their room: Besides Humbert, there is Quilty, masked, yet with an also masked woman: Who is she? Who is not a Doppelganger of somebody, this seems to be the question in Nabokov's world. As Hermann chooses his dissimilar Doppelganger in ""Despair"" in order to shoot him - so Humbert kills his dissimilar Doppelganger in ""Lolita"" (1962), but while in the Lynne-film from 1997, we see Humbert's face covered with wounds and blood so that is seems that he tried to kill himself, both in Lolita (1962) and in Despair (1978), the dissimilarity of the Doppelgangers is kept up strictly. The big difference between Lolita (1962) and Lolita (1997) is that Nabokov also wrote the scenario for the 1962 version.Is the Lolita whom we see at the end of both Lolia versions a similar Doppelganger of the original girl?",Lolita
102,HenryHextonEsq,Peter Sellers makes the film.,8,31 January 2002,"How wrong ""The_Wood"" is about this film... The previous commentator's jibe of ""dull performances"" so completely misses the mark I do not balk at laughter! To think he was watching the same film as I, is an odd thought, or more pointedly, the same magnificent performance from Peter Sellers as Clare Quilty. While I admit the film isn't entirely successful, I would say it is at least reasonable in most regards. Well shot and composed by Kubrick, I don't see how anyone could doubt its mounting. The opening scene, with Sellers riffing off Mason extraordinarily, is one of the greatest, oddest openings to a film ever. All sorts of proto-Pinteresque psychological mind games are deployed in this oddest of ""confrontation"" scenes. Maybe, one might say, the film doesn't generally match this inspired quality in the main body of the picture. The scenes which unquestionably do invariably involve Sellers. His portrayal and embellishment of Nabokov's more minor player, Quilty, is an outstanding success; for all the magnetic subtlety of ""Being There"" and high-octane comic mastery of ""Dr Strangelove"" I feel this performance to be the most magnetic, unnerving and ingenious of Sellers' career, such as I have seen it. The scenes between Sellers and Mason, the incalculably more sedate, classical actor, are like eras and mindsets shifting, uncomfortably and compellingly. Sellers plays Quilty as an amoral jokester, a daunting genius alter-ego of Humbert, uninhibited and unrestrained in his game-playing. I ought to make mention of the party scene early on, with Quilty dancing diffidently and cynically with some dame or other. Moments such as this scene in the film are pure acting subtlety demonstrated by Sellers, and he practically maintains the compelling interest embodied by this character throughout. Wonderful. Who could forget, or indeed ignore as the two previous reviewers have, the sublimely tense and comic scene at the hotel with Sellers' and Quilty's ""policeman"" probing Humbert in a simultaneously precise and absurd manner. Where some critics have said Sellers' Quilty is over-used, I would say quite the opposite; he could have been used even more, although the irregularity and unpredictability of his appearances is tangibly effective.Mason is dependable as Humbert, and this mere ""dependability"" proves perhaps insufficient in a film dominated by one of the finest performances. The character's passions and motivations are quelled rather than exacerbated by Mason's mannered English gentleman playing of the part. However, his bearing and style of acting prove an irresistible counterpoint to Sellers. Kubrick evidently realized, on set, Sellers' genius for both precise comedic timing and subtle character acting, and rightly indulged these attributes. Other players in Nabokov/Kubrick/Sellers' comedic human pyschodrama are a mixture. Shelley Winters, an often unremarkable actress, portrays a hilariously unlovely lady very well. A victim, as in the majestic ""The Night of the Hunter"", Winters proves an elusively cursory actress. The scene where Mason is in the bath, and she subsequently dies, without the ""aid"" of Humbert is a master class in comedic acting from Mason and Winters. Sue Lyon, importantly, is maybe not quite the Lolita that is required. She's certainly alluring, but never quite the right mix of seductive innocence and dispensed nonchalance. She plays the part with maybe an over-emphasis on desultory petulance. Full marks, though, to Kubrick for the influential shots when Humbert sees her for the first time; brilliantly done. It is however, in the final analysis, a mistake, or cop-out, of casting to have Sue Lyon, a girl of around sixteen, rather than someone of the age Nabokov specifies in the novel. It misses, or rather skirts around, the point of ""Lolita"" somewhat.For all the film's faults, it's an entertaining, provocative (more in the sense of Humbert's guilt than in his desires) drama with an irreverent, thoughtful edge provided by the frighteningly good Sellers. As a film it is far from ""obsolete"", as user Hugh comments, it is an essential, if flawed adaptation of a literary classic. And I'm not being in the least bit ""sentimental"" in saying that.Rating:- ****/*****",Lolita
103,frankwiener,Jailbait,9,20 November 2017,"Aside from Kubrick's excellent direction, what makes this film succeed are a well chosen cast, a sharp and thoughtful screenplay, visually appealing locales, and a beautiful musical score by Nelson Riddle. James Mason's brilliant portrayal of Humbert Humbert transforms an ordinarily, dull professor into a fascinating, psychologically complex character as he is gradually consumed by his infatuation with Lolita, a fourteen year old girl who, by design, becomes his step daughter. Shelley Winters, cast once again as an unpleasant and often whining matron type with a grating, irritating voice (""Night of the Hunter"", ""Place in the Sun"", ""Patch of Blue""), perfectly fits the part of sexually frustrated Charlotte Haze, who is Lolita's overbearing and obnoxious mother. While several other reviewers did not appreciate Peter Sellers as Quilty, I found him to be very entertaining and don't believe that the film would have held my interest as much without him. He is a ""quilt"" of many different personalities, and I love how he literally throws himself into various accents, especially the German. A whimsical, unpredictable Quilty of many colors sharply clashes with a humdrum Humbert, who takes himself and life itself far too seriously, as an inevitable explosion continues to build.As to Sue Lyon, I found her to be very similar to her role in ""Night of the Iguana"" without much of a variation--very cute but aloof and, for the most part, emotionally detached from everyone and everything around her. Yes, she cries when she learns of her mother's fate but not for long. Once in possession of her desperately needed inheritance, her last words to a shattered, destroyed Humbert are, ""I hope that we can see each other some time!"" If Alaska doesn't work out, Lolita will be move on to the next episode of her life while Humbert is a fatally doomed man. For Humbert, it's the bitter end.While I found Bob Harris's ""Lolita Ya Ya"" theme song annoying and can't blame composer Bernard Hermann for not wanting to go near it, Riddle's score was otherwise quite pleasing to the ear, strongly enhancing the drama on the screen.While there may not be as many double entendres and word plays as in the novel, they pop up quite often in the film. I loved the one about Quilty's uncle, Lolita's dentist, who was more than ready to fill her cavity. In general, there's much more here than carefully painted toenails.",Lolita
104,ags123,"A delicious, adult meditation on youth, obsession and sex.",10,16 August 2005,"This film remains my all-time favorite. It's a delicious, adult meditation on youth, obsession and sex. While not entirely faithful to the novel, it captures the book's spirit and is nonetheless a masterpiece on its own terms. To fully appreciate what Kubrick has done, compare this version to Adrian Lyne's anemic remake. Kubrick chose his cast wisely for the most part. James Mason conveys both the tormented inner soul and the outwardly polite gentleman with such charm that you simply can't despise him for his treachery. Shelley Winters was never better as the shrill, man-hungry shrew. Sue Lyon is enormously credible in a complex role - physically attractive, childish at times in her behavior, but quietly calculating and manipulative. The weakest link is Peter Sellers, who Kubrick found amusing enough to let him run on too long. Sellers was a brilliant performer, but just not right for this film. As Quilty, he's fine. When masquerading as others, he's mostly intrusive and tends to alter the tone of what's going on. The need to tread carefully around the censors in 1962 actually works in the film's favor. There's a sophisticated subtlety that counterbalances the lurid subject matter. In fact, I even prefer the edited-for-television version of the scene in which Humbert and Lolita first have sex. Here she merely whispers in his ear before a suggestive fade-out. In the complete version of the film, the scene continues with them discussing a silly game played at summer camp. The less said, the better.""Lolita"" has aged remarkably well. Its topic is relevant today, and the careful craftsmanship that went into this production holds up beautifully. I think it's Kubrick's best film - they tended to get more self-indulgent as time went on. This one's a gem. Not to be overlooked are the aptly provocative title sequence and Nelson Riddle's luscious piano score.",Lolita
105,Atavisten,Kubrick in a subtle mood,9,30 June 2005,"The excellent novel turned into a screenplay by Vladimir Nabokov himself is one of the best movies Kubrick did. Due to censorship some things were let out, the better for it I say. Sue Lyon as Lo leaves nothing to be desired, her confidence and rebellion is convincing. James Mason is perfect as Humbert Humbert, his way of calculating, concealing his intentions and the way he tries to control Lo's life struggles its best with the sympathies you get for his lonely soul.And Peter Sellers provides the comedic element as well as suspense. When confronting Humbert at the hotel it was almost as tense as when Rugosjin confronted Raskolnikov in 'Crime and Punishment'.Kubrick shows his mastering of storytelling here. We don't need background on Humbert as we see his intentions in his actions. And what a way to start the movie!",Lolita

Shelley Winters was too-on the mark, Sue Lyon looked right, and throw in the psychotic great actor Peter Sellers as Quilty, regenerating every scene he was in. I'm not sure about the importance of Kubrick, but it's very high, and I like his early stuff (probably because of my age; early 50's).Black and white suited this (censored tale) that doesn't have the reputation it deserves.

108,kurosawakira,Hallucinatory Evasiveness,8,23 January 2013,"Kubrick's ""Lolita"" (1962) is clever, fun, thrilling and filmically brilliant. My favourite moments in filmic terms are the interior scenes in the house, especially the crane shots in the staircase and that claustrophobic atmosphere of his room, and Lolita's. The episodic structure requires patience, however, but the frantic pace does settle down as the film advances – the set-up happens very quickly, that's what I'm saying. James Mason is very good, as he's able to be innocent, funny and scary at the same time.I recommend the user comment ""All in the Environment"" (Feb 27, 2002) written by ""tedg"" – it's explicit about what makes Nabokov's book as enjoyable as it is, as well as why it's so difficult to translate to film. I agree wholeheartedly with his conclusions, except for me Kubrick's narrative experiment works beautifully: I most definitely saw Quilty as a sort of deus ex machina, the man behind the arras, super-human in his omniscience and omnipresence and hallucinatory evasiveness, so much so that in the end I was half-expecting him to be a figment of Humbert's imagination instead of a real person.I'm not a fan of Sellers, in particular, but for the most part I like him a lot here and the only scene that undoes the film's magic is that scene at the hotel that goes on too long for my taste. I know it's supposed to be a one-man show, the one scene where everything is put to motion, all plates spinning, but whereas I would've liked him to channel Kubrick, he channels more of the type we're accustomed to see him as. But that's partly our fault, since we see him in retrospect, especially through ""Dr. Strangelove"".If you're interested, the Library of America has released Nabokov's novel in a hardback volume that also includes the screenplay and two other wonderful works.It seems that IMDb now displays my vote for this title; it appeared after I made a minor edit on the text. I'm not partial to it, since it guides the reader's perception on the writer's opinion often more than the text itself, but there's nothing I can do about it at the moment.",Lolita
109,EddyTheMartian007,Stanley Kubrick Reviews #6 - Surprising Underrated Kubrick,9,14 June 2021,"(No Spoilers) Only Kubrick can make Lolita into a comedy film, that is both weirdly intense and funny at the same time, with no sexual content apart from comically obvious innuendos, whilst crafting a character study of a man who succumbs to his own perverse desires, and devastatingly realizes what he has become. Now I have not read the actual book, but I'm sure this is a faithful adaptation even if it isn't exactly accurate to the book, especially considering the original author wrote this screenplay. It's already a movie I thought about a ton and almost increased my score by a full point after watching it last night. I might even increase it more to be honest (and I did). I didn't even mean to make a full review but this movie is just that good. As I get closer and closer to finishing Kubrick's filmography I can't believe how many more great surprises he has left.At surface level it might seem pretty basic but peel back the layers and it reveals an incredibly well directed, subtle, dense, and powerful film filled with brilliant themes and characters. Seriously I can't believe how a movie seemingly so simple is so heavy with meaning and purpose. It has a great twist that brings all the characters together beautifully, recontextualizes the entire movie and relationships between the characters in a way that only makes everything that came before it even stronger. I can't believe how good Kubrick was even this early on.Kubrick says he wouldn't have made this movie if he knew how limited he would be by MPPC, but in some ways this makes the movie better as you're the one who has to think and decide what happened between them as Kubrick expertly directs you and nudges you to think certain things in some ways putting you in the mind of horrible Humbert Humbert, who is greatly performed by Jason Mason. Don't overlook the other great performances too, like Peter Seller's multiple roles that have actual plot importance, perfected later in Dr. Strangelove, and Sue Lyon who gives one of the stronger child performances of the time, and plays with the audience as much as the characters. By the way, this movie seems to be a good counterpart to Dr. Strangelove, both being comedies on dark topics, with themes of sexuality, beautiful black and white cinematography, and most importantly... Peter Seller's in multiple roles!This is a very well made movie in every regard. The black and white color palette works very well for the movie, and it's quite beautiful at times despite being quite understated. Kubrick always has great composition and it's here as well. The lighting is perfect for this film, being quite dark, as the characters hide theirselves too. I also wanted to mention how I love the piano theme for the movie that perfectly gets the feel of the movie. Even if this isn't one of Kubrick's flashier films, its actually quite impressively made when you take a closer look, like the set built to allow the camera to move through walls, and even floors, which I'm pretty sure inspired a ton of shots in future films. This movie is so packed with symbolism it's crazy.Some of it is quite obvious, like the array of phallus shaped objects, but other stuff is quite subtle too. As I mentioned with the lighting there's also a lot of lines, like bars, making it seem like the characters are trapped. While it's never outright said, Kubrick leaves hints and clues to tell you how the relationship is going, for example through the wardrobe, like when Humbert and Lolita have sex his clothes turn darker signifying his sins and shame. Even if it's ultimately left up to your own interpretation, the signs are there if you really want to look for it. I also love all the foreshadowing to the twist, which wasn't even that subtle looking back at it now.Before I get to spoilers, despite this being constant praises so far there are reasons why I didn't give it a higher score. In terms of Kubrick's other movies this is not one my lesser favorites enjoyment wise, particularly because it feels a little too long. Despite praising the inventive ways Kubrick got away with exploring the characters relationship without out right saying it, it still creates some problems. Especially on first watch I found it extremely difficult to find out how their relationship was going. I didn't get the symbolism until later after researching more about the movie and looking back through it. At first I genuinely didn't realize they were having sex till very late in the movie. It's not even clear when their sexual relationship begins actually. It's tone is also a little bit of an issue. Compared to Dr. Strangelove, this movie isn't nearly as funny, and because of this movie being a comedy certain things that could've been handled with a more serious tone seem a bit silly. Charlotte's character for example initially was kind of annoying and too silly for me, though I later understood her character. Overall though these aren't big issues, and this movie is great in every other element.(Major Spoilers) At First I didn't think some characters were that well developed, but after thinking much more about it many characters reveal who they are through their actions. For example how Charlotte reveals her insecurities and jealously over her own daughter as she kills herself instead of protecting her own daughter from Humbert Humbert. Speaking of Charlotte, like Quilty forgetting the relationship with her, but remembering about her daughter. Or most importantly our main character, who realizes by the end of the movie how he pathetically based his entire life around a relationship where Lolita was only with him for her own survival and truly loved another man, Quilty, all this time. One of the more messed up moments of the movie I didn't realize till after is why Humbert didn't tell Lolita her mother died, which is because he wanted her to be in the mood for sex... What?! Humbert Humbert is truly evil. He stripped Lolita from her family, education, and social life for his own pleasures, and he was still not in control. This seemingly educated man, promising writer, gives up everything just for this girl he abused and defiled, who still didn't even love him back, and was in a way just using him too. This puts everything into perspective at how far he has gone because of his evil perversion, and leaves the poor Lolita, who had to settle for a guy not so subtly named Dick, with the last thing he has to give, money.It's even more disgusting how Humbert let himself go forever when you realize even after leaving Lolita, realizing his horrid transgressions, he still can't let her go, and has to have his revenge, killing Quilty, the man who took Lolita from him. I think Quilty also represents Humbert's conscience as he's an ever looming presence that Humbert always suppresses and denies, and eventually is what makes Humbert leave Lolita. In the beginning Humbert thinks of killing Charlotte himself, but he can't bring himself to do it, but here he finally brings himself to his lowest point, making his final act about Lolita once again, symbolically killing Quilty, his conscience hiding behind a painting, in this barren, messy, broken down mansion.(8.7/10)",Lolita
110,theognis-80821,Great Love Story,10,17 April 2021,"Vladimir Nabokov is the ""auteur"" of this magnificent satire, with a screenplay that is even better than the occasionally repetitive and militantly alliterative novel. Nabokov's jokes about pretentious Americans and psychiatry are well made. Stanley Kubrick, who began as a still photographer, wisely employed the brilliant Oswald Morris for this masterpiece of black and white cinematography, who hired, yet again, the great Denys Coop (""This Sporting Life"") as his camera operator. I must disagree with Dwight MacDonald: every actor is perfectly chosen, up to and including Gary Cockrell. Poor Humbert is hooked from the first shocking image of Lolita: we can't blame him. (For her next two pictures, beautiful and talented Sue Lyon worked for no less than John Huston and John Ford.) Wonderful Shelley Winters is the perfect counterpoint. The shot of Humbert in the motel room after seeing Lolita in the hospital is a work of art, reminiscent of ""The Letter,"" another great picture about a criminal, who is all but convicted: light streaming through blinds resemble the bars of a cell. The folding bed and bellhop scene recalls the greatest slapstick comedy. The backlit shot of Humbert, struggling in the hospital corridor with a doctor, a nurse, and two orderlies is beautiful and poignant. Nowhere in literature or cinema is comedy and tragedy comingled more perfectly. And Nelson Riddle offers the finest score in his distinguished career.",Lolita
111,Kubris,Challenging,8,23 April 2012,"Lolita is unique. During and after, I felt polarized- not sure how to interpret the film. Should I have felt sympathy? Anger? Even pity? It's a viewer dependent film, and thoroughly underrated.Lolita is American Beauty before it was cool. The film follows a middle- aged man, as he becomes instantly starstruck by the titular character, and we watch him try to balance the roles he plays in her life, and it gets sticky, and creepy and uncomfortable.Now 50 years old, the content is still strange and difficult. The direct avoidance of acts results in exceptional innuendo and hilarious lines, like the ""broad minded"" couple.Not a drama, nor a complete romance or even a comedy, Lolita defines grey.The acting is very strong from an excellent cast. James Mason is lovestruck, control- demanding father/lover. Shelley Winters is hilarious at times as Lolita's spacey, repressed mother, and Sue Lyon perfect as the 'nymphet' childish yet mature. Also there's the invasive Peter Sellers, as the perspective bad guy with the best Kubrick-referencing line, 'No, I'm Spartacus.'Lolita is an unexpectedly strong film, boundary pushing, creepy and entertaining. It has a very fulfilling length, giving the idea that the full story has been told. 8.4/10",Lolita
112,FilmMuscle,"A Rushed, Detrimentally Censored Take on a Mature Story",6,16 October 2013,"Now, as to be expected, since I read the novel before seeing the film, I will judge it not as a standalone film but as an adaptation. It seems to me like reviewers here have been far too forgiving in regards to the overall execution of the film likely due to their lasting fanatic attraction with Kubrick's work. Let's disregard how ""godly"" of a filmmaker he is. Let's instead focus on why exactly this film was made during a time that was infamous for censoring almost anything that suggested steamy material. So, with that being said, why would someone attempt to make a film about a pedophile and his burning lust for a 12- year-old girl (she wasn't 14, but that's not really a detriment of the film's; I personally think it's fine) during this time of censorship? Only looking at its IMDb page prior to viewing it, I was immediately met with skepticism as to how good the film will turn out to be because of the ""Approved"" rating it had received. In this day and age, there are much less artistic limitations, which is why we have the privilege of witnessing stories about incest or pedophilia (usually in foreign films because we all know Hollywood will never have the guts). Some might find the concept of pedophilia highly disturbing. Then, don't see the film or read the book. It's that simple, but that absolutely doesn't give the film any excuse to tame the highly sexual tone of the book's. In fact, if one hadn't possessed any knowledge of the novel before seeing this film, there's a possibility that they wouldn't even obtain the notion that ""Professor Humbert"" feels deep affection for Lolita, romantically. To them, it would seem like a step-father who's highly concerned for his daughter and is desperately trying to protect her from any dangers of the outside world. Most of the scenes where Humbert makes love to Lolita are cut out from the film. There aren't any mentions whatsoever, and no kisses aside from the little one on the cheek towards the very end. And if you're going to suddenly refute my complaints with a ""but it's Approved and came out in the 60's, what do you expect""- Well, to that, I'll answer ""then why the hell was it made in the first place?"" And to those that say ""but having sex with a 14- year-old is wrong (or disturbing),"" well, don't watch the film. Again, that definitely doesn't serve as an excuse for Hollywood. You're adapting a book, which means that you should follow the original material, and usually, most people overwhelmingly groan about a film's lack of loyalty to its source, but here- because Kubrick is such a god and he never makes any mistakes- everyone is suddenly praising a work that suffers from a great deal of disloyalty. Actually, in general, the whole film just feels rushed. There are many significant scenes (no, they don't revolve around sex) that're tossed out of the film's plot and simply ignored by a fading black screen. We lose a lot of the complexity of Humbert's character- his backstory, his craving for Lolita's skin, and whatnot. In the novel, he was French and came to America with a strong French accent. In the film- Hollywood being Hollywood, and I'm guessing the studio largely interfered with Kubrick's production as they usually do- for some reason, he's a European man with a British accent who takes a fascination in French poetry. It all doesn't make sense. In Hollywood films, you're either American or British. These are the same issues that Hugo shared- ""living in France, but we all have British accents!"" Yeah, there are just so many problems that can't be conveniently brushed aside only because it's Kubrick at work. Other than the numerous faults- and if you haven't read the novel especially- the film does a great job of delivering a very interesting story. It informs the audience of mostly every event that leads the story to its conclusion, and it was an interesting choice to commence the film with the very end. All in all, if you haven't read the book, you'll definitely enjoy the film as I did when I forgot about the fact that it's a G-rated take on a highly controversial and mature story. If you read the amazing novel on the other hand, there's bound to be a lot of gripes you have with the picture- that is if you hold no bias in relation to Kubrick- oh, the master, Kubrick.",Lolita

But at the end, you see that with all his faults, his overposessiveness, paranoia, and dilemmas, to see him so raw and the end, as he gives the money to Lolita knowing that his love for her would never be reciprocated, it really just makes you want to sympathise with him for all his aches. And for this, Stanley Kubrick has done an excellent job in bring the book to life (though I have by no means read it yet).Still, it was clever how Kubrick used a really neat trick, where the devil's in the details(or lack thereof). It gives one the space to fill in all those gaps with your own assumptions and basically read between the lines, giving each audience a different take on what actually happened, and thus a different perception of the process and outcome.Overall, this is most definitely in the vein of what Kubrick is known for, and if you're into his films, you're in for a treat. Otherwise to the average Joe living in this day and age, I'd say skip it. You'll probably chuck it up to ""odd movies from a lost era""",Lolita

It's a good story. The first half of the movie I found both hilarious and serious at the same time, the second half however was a bit lengthy. I guess that's my only problem with the film, it was too long, the story was good, but they should have cut it just slightly.The first half I think was marvellous, filled with weird little hints of what's really going on between Humbert and Lolita, no wonder the tag line is ""how in earth did they ever make a film of Lolita?"". Just having made this film as early as 1962 is incredible in it self and only Kubrick could have done it. The relationship between Humbert and Chalotte was much sadder on the other side. I must say, Charlotte was the only character I actually sympathised with.The second part however i felt was a bit repetitious, and Humbert started to get obsessive. I felt it was just nothing but quarrels again and again and again. They could have cut this slightly down, and we would still understand what was going on.Now except for being a little melodramatic, I really liked the ending. In my opinion it was the only decent thing Humbert did in the film, and for the first time I feel that the viewer can actually feel sorry for him.So I give this film a 8/10.

Mission accomplished, but 'Lolita' was the film that I left until very last as I knew it was going to be boring.But I loved it.Let's go through the acting performances.""James Mason is a bit of an old fart and this film will be really dull"", I said to myself. But he was great and played the father-figure perfectly.Shelly Winters, ""again"" I thought ""that annoying fat woman from the original 'Poseiden Adventure' who doesn't make it"", but she was even more annoying in this film and that's why she was so good. Acted perfectly, driving her rebellious daughter off the rails.And Sue Lyon who was really good as well, but not as good as the two main actors. Saucy, narrow-minded, brainless, using little bitch, in a nutshell.I'll definitely watch Lolita again if I get the chance. It doesn't rank as one of Kubrick's best films, but it's still a very worthy part of his collection and so much better than his earlier 1950's output, although 'Paths of Glory' is still a decent film.Don't be put off by the 1962 tag; the year of release makes no difference, as the story does the real talking.",Lolita
118,ian_harris,"Compelling, subtle, surprisingly great movie",8,30 October 2002,"We watched this film with some trepidation - the subject matter based around obsession and sex with a minor is somewhat unnerving.  To be honest, we saw it primarily to fill a gap in our Kubrick set, despite the fact that we had been told by many that it was lesser Kubrick.  Yet the film is compelling, subtle, funny, sad and in some ways exciting.  Surprisingly, we concluded that it is a great movie.  Up there with the best of Kubrick in our view.
Peter Sellers is superb as Clare Quilty - the character could have been written for Sellers (no doubt the film part was).  James Mason (not a favourite normally) was spot on for his part, as were Shelley Winters and Sue Lyon for their parts.The normal Kubrick attention to detail abounds with interesting camera angles, lenses etc. etc.  The scene at Camp Climax with the ""sole boy"" especially sticks in the mind, as does the scene in the hotel where Quilty acts up as a ""cop meets Woody Allen"" type so creepy we squirmed.Haven't seen the 1997 version so can't compare, but suspect that the subtlety that makes the Kubrick version work so well for us might be lacking in 1997.",Lolita
119,rjsf96,Forbidden Fruit,10,29 December 2016,"Stanley Kubrick's Lolita will for many (over 50 years on from its original release) seem safe and quite possibly routine. This though is simply not the case. At the time it was seen to be racy and in poor taste, so much so that the MPAA demanded that Kubrick made cuts to the film, otherwise they would deny him releasing it to the public. However, even with these restrictions in place Lolita works astoundingly well and even on many more levels if you try to view it with the mind-set of the general public in the 60s. Then it's all too obvious that Lolita is a daring project, beautiful to look at and yet remains a wonder that it ever saw the light of day at all.Humbert Humbert (James Mason) having recently entered America has moved into a house in Ramsdale residence of Mrs Haze. Originally only moving in so that he can become a college Professor - Humbert becomes undeniably infatuated by Mrs Haze's daughter; Lolita, oozing sexual confidence and spark. Who can blame him? Well other than the fact that he is in his fifties and she in this adaptation fourteen. So of course it is this area of the film that has sparked up controversy ever since 1962. The line ""I'm going to take your Queen"" possibly causing the most outrage – played over a game of chess. Though, the controversy of Lolita unlike 1971's A Clockwork Orange is hard to believe. In this day and age its relatively tame when compared to 1999's American Beauty a film that shares certain similarities with Lolita to say the least. Lolita for one has no nudity unless you count an underage girl clad in a revealing bikini and I for one don't. Any sexual references are low key and any moment proceeding intercourse is cut short. So you really have to play it out in your mind more than anything else. Though for me this is beneficiary to the picture, characterising Lolita's innocence, deep insecurity and tendency to shy away at the more intimate moments. Sue Lyon in her first role is positively enlightening. This is for sure a hard role to ""get right"". You have to know how to play the different characteristics of Lolita for a start and portray her vibrancy with the needed enthusiasm. But, Lyon handles it well, so well in fact that you'd swear she'd been in show business for a lifetime or at least a good handful of roles. James Mason on the other hand as Humbert Humbert is treading thin ice; yet, he manages to do the trick. The fact that we actually sympathise with a character this conniving and want to watch him on screen is a testament to Mason's staying power as an actor of rare talent, rarely seen nowadays, if at all. Peter Sellers as Claire Quilty is a different matter entirely and yes, I mean that as a compliment. Sellers just goes for it! Wacky, brilliant, witty and insane all these adjectives actually apply. But even the use of mere words cannot describe how funny he is in each situation, that's because Sellers understands what makes humour work. Edging the line between camp and utter silliness, Sellers is definitely a key factor as to why I adore Lolita so so very much.A picture like Lolita makes me look at films in an entirely different light. That wasn't a pun. Yet I must talk about the lighting. This is a film that is dazzling to view, and if you think that because its Black and White it cannot look this good, then I'm afraid you are sorely mistaken. Every shade of black and white is honestly a marvel and reminds me that splendid cinematography is about lighting, composition and framing, not different hues of a wide range of colours.Lolita is the sort of film Hollywood does not make anymore; witty, campy, fun, interesting, daring and never self-serious. This is a film without the glitz and glamour of Hollywood, before the advent of CGI, where characters took centre stage, not action or flashy special effects. Watching Kubrick's Lolita is like watching a by- gone age of cinema where story and characters were key to a film's success, not flashes of colour and the rising sound of a fireball. A+",Lolita
120,littlemartinarocena,"Whispering, Loudly",10,7 April 2007,"A riveting transposition from page to screen. The accomplices are two giants in both fields. Nabokov adapts his own infamous novel for the screen and Kubrick, no less, translates it into images in a way that makes it unique, unforgettable and transcendental without ever putting himself in front of the camera. A Kubrick film can't be recognized by its style. Kubrick never made two films alike but there is something that, unquestionable, makes them stand out. In ""Lolita""'s case the mere idea of touching the controversial novel with its taboo subject at its very core seem like a provocation from the word go. Pornography for the thinking man in which the only explicit act is the intention written in the character's eyes. Nothing is excessive and nothing is pulled back. James Mason - villain or victim - is monumental, mo-nu-men-tal! The unspeakable truth never leaves his brow. He is the most civilized man trapped in the lowest echelon of his own psyche. So aware, that it is painful to watch. Shelley Winters goes for it, taking her Mrs Hayes for all its worth and dives into the void of a desperate housewife, craving for sex. It is one of the most entertaining, shattering human spectacles, I've ever seen. But unlike Mason, she's not aware of it. There is a horrible innocence attached to her sickness. Peter Sellers's character from hell, the torturer comes in three riveting characterizations and Sue Lyon's temptress, the child, is the devil incarnate in a performance that defies description. None of them were nominated for Oscars and the film was condemned by every moral group in America and beyond. As film experiences go, this is one of the most provocative, enthralling, disgusting, entertaining and satisfying I've ever been through. Yep, I really mean that.",Lolita
121,rdukeesq,i actually am giving this a 6.5 for borderline good but not quite there,6,6 July 2011,"So I watched Stanley Kubrick's Lolita from 1962, well is it a classic, sadly I say ehhh. This is a good movie make no doubt about it, I like the use of sexual innuendo throughout the movie, I liked Peter Sellers role as Quilty, the acting was good, the movie very funny at times, but it was too long, the use of an epilogue was pointless, and the opening scene should be at the end in my opinion. I have not read the book by Nabakov so I cannot comment on how closely it follows the original story, nor have I seen the remake with Jeremy Irons to see if that has a little more graphic nature, so I can only comment on this film. I love Kubrick he gave us several great films including one of my personal faves a clockwork orange, but here I don't think he had all the elements in place to make a truly great movie that stands the test of time. I hate to say it (without sounding like a perv) but I think if the original age of the girl (I believe 12) and the eroticism was more direct, it could have been a disturbing yet classic film. However if you are a fan of either movies from this time, Peter Sellers, or Kubrick it is worth watching and I did enjoy this movie overall, just wasn't blown away by it.",Lolita
122,matheusmarchetti,"Alongside ""A Clockword Orange"", THIS is Kubrick at his best",10,5 November 2008,"Perverse, sensual, disturbing, poetic and beautiful. These are the words I can use to describe Stanley Kubrick's ""Lolita"". Kubrick couldn't ve been better picked to direct this jaw-dropping film adaptation of the equally excellent novel. Unlike the overrated remake by Adrian Lynne, this one doesn't to show you in the face the relationship between Humbert (James Mason, in a outstanding performance) and Lolita (Sue Lyons), for the audience to get what it means, and even without the scenes the film is very disturbing, since the time of it's release to it's very day! The beautiful score by Nelson Riddle who doesn't fail to bring me to tears is also a strong highlight of the film, which wonderfully portrays forbidden desires, suspense and romance. The performances are just, fantastic, specially Shelley Winters and Peter Sellers. They portray the annoying characters so well that you really want to kill theme, you really feel the same way Humbert feels towards them. It's funny, because you sympathize with the character which could easily be the villain and you want him and Lolita to be happily ever after, but, things don't go as planned and it all builds up to the ending which never fails to bring me to tears. This should be considered up there with A Clockwork Orange and The Shining, as it's probably Kubrick's best. A truly remarkable motion picutre, Watch ""Lolita"". You'll certainly won't be disappointed. It's true art. The remake is good, but fails on it's attempt to make it a better film, which simply ain't.",Lolita

But the ""Lolita"" that Vladimir Nabokov wrote as a novel and the ""Lolita"" he wrote to be a film, directed by Stanley Kubrick, are two conspicuously different things.In the first place, the character of Lolita, is not a child in the movie. She is now 17 years of age, with a promiscuous flare to her. The distinction is fine, we will grant you, and the performance by Sue Lyon is great, but she is definitely not a ""nymphet.""Further, the structure and the climax of the movie are not the same as those of the book. The movie starts with the melodramatic incident that brings the novel to a close, then flashes back to the beginning and tells its story in a narrative flashback. Thus the viewer is warned by this weird preface that the ending is going to be grim. It sucks out all curiosity that the viewer might have of the novel beforehand.Overall, this is not an accurate representation of the novel, but it is still a great movie to watch. All the actors play their roles greatly, and it is still a great premise. Plus, they somehow sneak in the sexual innuendo between Humbert (James Mason) and Lolita.

Lolita is a powerful novel with exquisite prose that is difficult to transfer to celluloid. Kubrick's Humbert Humbert is never truly examined. We never learn about what causes his eternal longing for Lolita like we do in the novel. James Mason has learned the ways of charm and deception ever so shamelessly. He uses his skills on Shelly Winters who plays Lolita's dramatic mother, a woman who lives her life in the romantizing American Dream, where a man is suppose to come up on a horse and take her away into the sunset.Sue Lyon plays Lolita. Although very pretty and sexy, hardly a Lolita. However, Lyon does play a manipulating girl quite aware of her allure and the power it has. Brooke Shield's Pretty Baby would have been a better choice for such a film.Kubrick's film does not possess the power of his later works. Lolita has very few innovations of style or camera movements.

127,dj_xand325,A grand adaptation of Nabokov's sickly astonishing novel,8,28 February 2008,"Lolita is a film about psycho-sexual fantasy which is later revisited by Kubrick in 1999 through the film, Eyes Wide Shut. Could these two be compared? No.The story of Lolita is very simple, Professor Humbert Humbert moves into a new home and becomes obsessed with his landlady's sexually active 13 year old daughter, Lolita. The obsession then leads to the man deteriorating into a mentally disturbed criminal. Humbert's detoriation is assisted by Peter Sellers' character Quilty, a competitor for Lolita's heart.The narrative of the film is relatively non-linear, the ending is at the beginning. This was a very clever feature implemented by Kubrick because it left me gripped and thinking about what possibly this beginning could mean. Also it gives the film a smooth and lyrical ending which explains everything.What was particularly brilliant about this film is how Kubrick manages to create unbearable sexual tension in the scenes without actually showing a single sexual image (apart from maybe the iconic image of Lolita lying down in the bikini). Censorship in the 60s meant that Kubrick had limitations in what he could show. The absence of sexual images makes the film cool and subtle and this in my opinion is more powerful than showing full sex scenes.Despite this, the film was still rated X when it came out due to the obvious theme of peadophilia. However, the BBFC now rate it a 15 so it shows how much our film tolerance has changed!.Jason Mason was very good in this film and he managed to convey sexual desire perfectly. I was also very impressed with Peter Sellers' performance as a smart-talking writer, his darkly comical performance was perfection despite his small role.Although, this was a very good quality film, it doesn't truly live up to the standards of Kubricks later films (the shining, a clockwork orange etc) therefore, i reward it with 8/10",Lolita
128,middleburg,Brilliant--not really the book--but still brilliant,10,10 January 2004,"What a surreal, dreamlike world Stanley Kubrick creates with this intriguing film! The book, a recognized 20th century classic, is at times disturbing, hysterically funny, uncomfortably erotic, and heartbreakingly sad.  The film, made in the 60s, captures many of the same feelings generated by the book--but the censorshipof the time could only allow Kubrick to suggest the more intimate and eroticaspects of the book--which he slyly succeeds in doing.  It is hard to believe now, but when this film was released, it was considered to be unbelievablyprovacative and absolutely for adults only. The movie becomes its own artistic statement---Kubrick doesn't merely try torecreate the scenes and storyline of the book--although much of it is there--but he uses the period music, speech, clothes and mannerisms to create his ownimaginative and fascinating world.  At the same time, we sure do end up caring about the characters.  Within the exceptional cast, note the special performance Shelly Winters gives--her character is at once funny and so achingly sad andpathetic.  This is a real tour-de-force of acting.  In several instances we go from laughing at her to really disliking her, to feeling so very sorry for her. She creates a truly memorable character.'The film ranks right up there with all of the spectacfular films Kubrick made during his amazing and very singular career---each of his films was sodistinctive--and Lolita is one of the most distinctive of them all.",Lolita

I derive such pleasure from watching James Mason, Peter Sellers, Shelly Winters and Sue Lyon do there collective thing that it almost distracts from the other aspects of remarkable cinema on display here. Genius is a word that gets thrown around quite a bit. That being said its the one word that comes to mind when I think of how to describe Mr. Mason and Sellers respective performances in this film. They are both remarkable at fooling me into thinking not that they are these characters but that the words uttered are in fact there's and not from a script. Perhaps they were ad-libbed..perhaps not. Thats not the point...the point of the matter is that it all seems to flow so naturally from them as to not even seem like acting at all. Charlotte Haze is a character who has little to truly say but doesn't let that stop her and Shelly Winters is quite good at spewing said dialog at a mile a minute. Then there is Sue Lyon aka the titular Lolita. She is tasked with being both vulgar childish girl and a woman who is capable of wooing two seemingly intelligent men and does so with marvelous grace. Then we have the films quite lovely mise en scène cinematography. Many dialog scenes are covered from very few angles, quite a few take place in only one shot.

How did he even get cast. In 1962 were they that desperate? Certainly desperate enough to case Shelly Winters as the mum. Surely the character should have some redeeming features? As for Clare Quincy - what kind of name is that? Peter Sellars hams it up every time he has a moment. I'd like to think he was laughing at the movie, the script and the rest of the cast.The Lolita herself is a kid of 15 playing a 14 year old. Theatrical would be a kind way to describe her.

Still, due to the sensitivities of the general public of that era, the screenplay had to be altered significantly, and many scenes were just suggestive dialogues left to the imagination of the viewer.Humbert Humbert is a European 40 something divorced professor who has some time before starting his stint in the university. He rents a room from a promiscuous widow (Charlotte) just because he fancies the precocious teenage daughter (Lolita). He gets along well with them while writing his book and joining in the family outings. The landlady forthrightly expresses her feelings to our professor while the daughter is sent off to a summer camp.They marry. An argument breaks out when Charlotte reads his diary. Here, he had written his desires for his stepdaughter and had addressed his wife as a cow and other derogatory terms). Frustrated, she runs out in the rain to be hit by a car, fatally wounding her.Humbert picks Lolita from the summer camp. Without telling her about her mother's demise, he takes an extended tour to the supposed hospital with suspicious characters (whom he thinks are the cops) following them. They have a relationship, and finally, he spills the beans about Charlotte's accident.They move into the university town. He teaches in a university, and she studies in the school nearby. He becomes an over-protective parent and monitors her every move. She, on the other hand, plays truant. When the truth is known, and when Humbert realises that the neighbours are talking about their unusual father-daughter relationship, he takes Lolita on a road trip (for educational purposes).Along the way, he encounters some suspicious characters. Lolita fell seriously ill and had to be hospitalised. As she gets better, she absconds from the ward and is never found.3 years later, Humbert receives a letter from Lolita. She is now married to some guy, pregnant and was broke. Humbert takes a drive there to discover that all the while, he had been taken for a ride as well. The suspicious guy who was following them was her boyfriend (Peter Sellers, like a chameleon in many disguises). After running from the hospital with him, she followed him to Hollywood as he was a play-writer. The role that she was promised turned out to be for 'arty' films. And she left. She was 6 months pregnant and was to start life new in Alaska. Humbert leaves the scene...The artist value of the film is commendable. Mason, the seasoned player, sets the mood for a broody insecure intellect. We feel pity for Shelley Winter gives a good account of a lady who tries to show her bourgeoisie and how she is laughed at subtly. Peter Sellers must have got the role for Inspector Clouseau in the Pink Panther series after his excellence disguises here.

133,Dia Klain,Could this movie be any worse?,2,22 July 2001,"This version of Lolita is a classic example of a bad interpretation to a good book. This may seem surprising considering it was produced by Kubrik, and the script was written by Nabokov himself. The film follows closely, though not as close as to the new film except for separate scenes. One of the many big mistakes of this movie is that for some crazy reason the whole history of Annabel is left out and the viewer is left hanging with no grip on why Humbert loves Lolita so in the first place. This is like Adam and Eve without the tree. They also do not speak of the concept of nymphets. When Lolita is taken away by Quilty the movie does not show Humbert searching for her at all. All these events make the movie quite bare and boring to watch. The fact is that the center-point in the movie was not even Lolita, or Humbert's love for Lolita, but Humbert slowly turning mad. In a sense this is understandable since in the early 60s a movie could not be as up-front about incest and other such moral dilemmas. There is even a scene in the book and both movies where Humbert explains to Lolita that two people sharing the same hotel room are destined to engage in a relationship... here he stumbles and Lolita puts in `The word is incest.' In the old movie she does not, and the scene is simply cut. To add to all this, the actors chosen for the parts are all quite terrible. Lolita is too sweat and nice, Humbert is old and unpleasant and does not fit the description of the Humbert in the book. The movie is also too sympathetic towered the mother who is a bad actress and plays all her scans with a frozen face. Quilty, I must admit, is a good actor, and perhaps the one good thing about this movie. He stumbles and talks a lot and would be great except that his whole image is totally wrong for the part for Quilty. The quote for this movie is `How did they ever make a movie of Lolita?'  they may have made a movie, but it was not the time, and the movie would have probably been better off not made. If you happened to be Lolita obsessed like me and want to research the script, book, and both movies, then watch it just for comparison. Otherwise you would probably be better off watching another of  Julia Robert's romantic comedies.",Lolita
134,Teyss,Morally dubious and superficial: Kubrick's worst movie?,5,11 October 2019,"A great novel from one of the greatest 20th century authors adapted by one of the greatest directors... must produce a great movie, right? Wrong.THE NOVELFirst, let us not undervalue the novel, a reference in world literature: for instance, it is included in the Norwegian Book Club's famous list of the 100 best books of all time and in Nobel laureate Vargas Llosa's selective list of his 9 favourite novels. Amongst many qualities, it is a moral opus on humanity and monstrosity: Humbert is a paedophile, yet he is also intelligent, seducing and pathetic. We understand and pity him, to an extent, regarding his shattered childhood love for Annabel, his mother's early death, his divorce, his stays in psychiatric hospitals, etc. On this perilous path, Nabokov treads carefully by avoiding two opposite pitfalls: depicting Humbert as a complete monster, which would be of limited interest; finding excuses for his behaviour, which could represent a justification for any crime. Hence everything in the novel is put into perspective: Humbert's mental illness, his thoughts about this, his intelligence, his humour and, most of all, his narration.Indeed, Nabokov remarkably handles first-person narration: we slowly realise Humbert is unreliable, not about actual facts (we could not say if they are accurate or not, since he is the only narrator), but their interpretation. For instance, he depicts Lolita mostly as greedy, vulgar, selfish, insensitive, cheating... but we progressively realise it is largely inaccurate. Hence we question narration itself, down to its style: it is very articulate and humorous, but too much so. Isn't Humbert fooling us, as well as himself, with his neat ""Confession"" about his otherwise despicable self?THE MOVIEKubrick makes two unfortunate major artistic decisions.1. The movie barely criticises humbert. Granted, it is not easy to represent unreliable narration on screen, but Kubrick does worse: he adopts Humbert's point of view. Lolita is just a little brat, Charlotte a brainless dragon, Quilty a devilish manipulator. Notably, essential elements about Lolita are omitted or downsized:
She feels miserable only once, when she learns about her mother's death, but it is short. In the novel it lasts longer and there are other depictions of her despair.We do not see how sincerely she loves her disabled husband at the end.The tennis coach's important comment saying Lolita is talented but loses because she is ""so polite"", is discarded.The fact everybody calls Dolores ""Lolita"", while in the book only Humbert does so, is revealing: his perception of Dolores as a nymphet invades the whole story.Hence characters are not only shallow: they fit Humbert's vision.Humbert himself is rarely shown committing fiendish acts, as opposed to the novel:
Lolita seduces him in the hotel whilst in the book it is less clear.There are no other innuendos about their sexuality.There is no account about Humbert's plans to rape her whilst in the book he tries twice, by giving sedatives to Charlotte and then Lolita.He does not blackmail her.There is no indication about his attraction to other young girls, so he almost appears as a person truly in love instead of a paedophile.He just considers shooting Charlotte but quickly dismisses the idea whilst in the book he comes very close to drowning her.After Charlotte dies he gets drunk whilst in the book he gloats with joy.Eventually he is not arrested, as if the director's verdict were ""not guilty"".Granted, there are naturally other omissions, yet the above-mentioned constitute important choices because they exonerate Humbert. Also some alterations, notably concerning sexuality, might have been necessary because of censorship; but then, is it excusable to film such dynamite without the full possibility to do it ethically?Apart from omissions, the original story is marginally modified in other ways: Quilty's role is expanded and minor differences are introduced (e.g. Lolita is a 14 year-old blonde instead of a 12 year-old brunette). However these changes have no effect on the movie's ethical ambiguities. Critic Greg Jenkins said: ""A story originally told from the edge of a moral abyss is fast moving toward safer ground."" As a direct consequence, the movie lacks depth. Indirectly, instead of being scrutinised, monstrosity becomes unchallenged, almost acceptable.2. The movie mainly focuses on action. Kubrick could have gone down a morally perilous path by compensating with other qualities, for instance dark humour or strong themes. However there is little more than a simple account of events without perspective.
Artistic direction is plain. The only scene worth mentioning is when Humbert kills Quilty, which is grotesque enough but far from the novel's level.Social satire is limited. Mental illness is not investigated.The US road trip remains abstract: we see little of the 50,000 km the main characters travel, probably because most was actually shot in England.The few humorous elements are only partly convincing: ironic music is sometimes added; Quilty's character is expanded and provides somewhat funny but unnecessary scenes; humorous lines extracted from the novel lack impact.The multiple sarcastic remarks, wordplays, witty literary references and the intriguing puzzle to find Quilty are mostly discarded.The tragic dimension is absent, for instance Lolita's above-mentioned despair or the eventual deaths of Lolita, her baby and Humbert (disregarding Quilty's ludicrous death): the atmosphere remains very tame, without asperities.All this emphasises the moral issues mentioned in point 1, since they are not offset by interesting features.What can be saved in the movie? Acting is excellent, notably James Mason in the lead role and Peter Sellers in three impersonations: himself, a policeman, Dr Zempf (this incidentally inspired the idea to have him play different characters in ""Dr Strangelove"" two years later). Action unravels seamlessly, despite the fact the last scene where Humbert kills Quilty is placed at the beginning for no valid reason (in the book it is towards the end since narration is strictly chronological). It is sometimes comical. If it can console Kubrick's fans, ""Lolita"" is arguably his only failure (""Spartacus"" being debatable).",Lolita
135,yellowtail_tuna,Miserable comedy of a man who fall apart in love.,9,6 May 2020,"Humbert is an ordinary middle-aged man, seems to have managed to spent his life pretty safely, and have acheaved decent career success, without losing social reputation. This is a story where this kind of man becomes infatuated with a teenage girl and is led to ruin.He becomes a lodger in Charlotte's house in a resort town, with initial intention to spend the summer, and that's where he meets Lolita, the widow's daughter. Lolita is naturally naughty and flirtatious, and shows whimsical curiosity in Humbert.Sexually frustrated after her husband's death years ago, Charlotte doesn't hide her desire for Humbert. She is so miserable that I cannot help feeling pity. The three shots of Humbert, Charlotte, and Lolita are always dark commedy, contrasting the winner and the loser in Humbert's affection.You might not really like the former Humbert, the hypocritical intellectual, never losing smile of superficial courtesy on his face. And you will preffer to see such a man losing his mind with a girl and falling apart to a wretch, because that's actually who he really is.Throughout the film, music talks a lot. Especially I love ""Lolita Ya Ya"", the song that is created to make fun of Humbert. I laughed out loud at the scene where after an accident that is supposed to be a tragedy, Humbert is secretly happy in the bath tub with the song playing.After the relationship Humbert and Lolita becomes settled, the story turns into some kind of mystery. Humbert's suspicion becomes ours: is she cheating? with who? From the scenes at the beginning of the film, the presense of the strange man named Quilty persists. And he begins to interfare with Humbert's secret love life.As a Kubric film, shots are always precisely planed and controlled. I wonder what it would look like if it is a color film. I might be good, especially Lolita would be charming in more fashonable way. But black and white more focuses on Humbert's psychology, comedic misery of a person who is destined to be a loser in love.",Lolita
136,darioilg,Beautiful performances and hidden innuendos,9,17 January 2017,"To make a movie about ""Lolita"" in the early '60s was a difficult task, considering how the censorship and society of the time could've taken some of the most controversial scenes of a story where a literature professor falls in love (spiritually and physically) with a barely teenager girl. Kubrick's choice, alongside Nabokov's screenplay he heavily changed, is a winner: very little of the sexual relationship between Lolita and the professor is shown on camera, but the smaller and bigger hints say more than an explicit scene. The adult is completely subdued by the pure beauty and cocky behavior of his nymphet who feeds him like a dog (at the beginning), has him paint her toe-nails (in the second part and during the titles) and basically manages to have anything she wants out of him, only to discard him later without a word. Humbert himself is a very damaged man, whose obsession leads him to sudden impulses of violence even against his beloved, when caught by a jealousy attack for some teenage boy. The absurdity of Humbert's scoldings to a girl whose interest for boys her age is only natural and whose intercourses with Humbert are not is a device used by the director in other works, namely ""Paths of Glory"" (in regard to war) and ""Dr. Strangelove"" (same).Kubrick's direction is pretty classic in this film, although some sparse scenes give a twist to the plain drama style: some comedy can be identified in the cot scene (which is hilariously similar to the classic silent films gags) and in the character of Clare Quilty, while aspects of noir/thriller are Charlotte's sudden death, the car following the protagonists and the opening/final scene.In ""Lolita"" I saw some of the best acting in Kubrick's films, starting with the stellar performance by the lead James Mason, who was perfectly cast for the role and is able to convey very well Humbert's social discomfort and obsession, all the way to pure madness in the hospital scene. It's impossible not to talk about Sue Lyon's Lolita: the actress was 16 at the time and yet she was capable of pulling off one of the most iconic characters in XX century literature. She is and acts extremely hot, with total control of the situation when relating with her slave/lover and at no time does it seem that she feels embarrassed. A truly incredible talent. While I loved beyond reason Peter Seller's performance(s) in ""Dr. Strangelove"", here I didn't always find him fitting with the overall atmosphere: his frantic acting can grow tiring after the first couple of scenes he's in and I frankly don't know if the character himself is a real addiction to the story or just a nuisance.",Lolita
137,guyzradio,"Times change, and with them, the definition of what's shocking",7,2 December 2019,"Lolita hit the screens when I was in junior high school in 1962. All I remember is the trailer was so suggestive of something taboo, I couldn't imagine the shame and punishment if I watched the movie and word got back to my parents (an ever present danger in a small town). Lolita has thus endured the stigma until I finally watched it on Netflix some 60 years later.A few things struck me about the movie. First, present day news stories have diluted any shock value of Lolita to the degree we can easily dismiss the idea of an adult man having a relationship with a teenage girl as reprehensible, but nothing new. If sexual implications are removed, the visual shock element consists of a quite unremarkable early scene of Lolita in a two-piece bathing suit. One bit of trivia notes that her signature and somewhat suggestive heart-shaped sun glasses are only a feature of the trailer.Another observation is how well the movie demonstrates the differing value systems of adults and adolescents, even though they may find commonality in sex. While Humbert is thoroughly taken by Lolita's sexuality, she is still an immature adolescent, e.g., when Humbert asks her what she wants from her old home, she replies ""My record player and records."" Lolita demonstrates this stage of mental development to varying degrees often in the movie.Shelly Winters seems perfect as a over-reaching, sexually frustrated neurotic widow. It is also interesting how Humbert becomes increasingly neurotic and jealous as he imagines Lolita cheating on him, something that Lolita finally admits to with an air of ""it's sex...it's what I do.""The main negative I found in Lolita is Humbert speeds away from his last encounter with Lolita, and the screen displays a note that he died of a heart attack while in prison. This seemed an overly abrupt way to end the movie. A few additional scenes might have made for a tidier conclusion.The black and white cinematography is expertly done. Peter Sellers is amazing as usual. Sorry I waited this long to see the movie.",Lolita

140,Apollo-14,Emotionally cold and too intellectual.,8,8 June 1999,"As much as I respect Kubrick as one of the greatest filmmakers ever, in this movie he is too full of himself.  As Adrian Lynne, who did the remake a couple of years ago, said, Kubrick's film should might as well be called ""Quilty.""It's true that Sellers dominates this film, whereas in Nabokov's novel Quilty is more of a shadowy figure.  The relationship between Humbert and Lolita is not treated with the same sensitivity as it is in Nabokov's book or in Lynne's ""Lolita.""  In no other of Kubrick's films is his emotionally distant directing and lack of intimacy so bothersome as in ""Lolita.""  The only character I felt I knew well enough was Quilty and I really don't know why Kubrick wanted it that way.However, this film -for all its deviations from the novel- is better in developing the relationship between Humbert and Lolita's mom. Surprisingly, Kubrick gives more depth to that relationship compared to Lynne, whose film is overall far more intimate and engrossing.In conclusion, if you want to understand Nabokov's book without actually reading it, see Lynne's ""Lolita.""  Kubrick's version is pure Kubrick but lacking the genius of Dr. Strangelove and Clockwork Orange.",Lolita
141,artisticengineer,A premonition of the future; great film to look at the past,8,3 May 2009,"This is a Stanley Kubrick movie; though perhaps not his most major work it is still, nonetheless, a great movie. For most movie directors this quality work would have been the zenith of a career; for Kubrick it was just another stepping stone in his directorial progression! Kubrick was only 32 years of age when he directed this masterpiece; years younger than all but one of the primary actors that he directed in this film. The fact that he was the undisputed director and given the due respect by these performers shows his already acknowledged talent.All the actors, with the possible exception of James Mason, turn in stellar performances. Mason probably wanted to, but seemed to be uncertain as to how far he could ""push the envelope"" with his part of a ""dirty old man"" in that day and age. Some commentators have mentioned the constraints faced by Kubrick due to the Hays Moral Code. However, what most people fail to realize is that in that day and age (and I was there and remember it) the entire subject was something that most people did not like to talk about or even think of. Society was much more formal back then, and the actions and/or attitudes shown on the majority of TV sit coms today would not have been tolerated in most of society. Or, at least tolerated in movies or TV. Please remember, back in 1962 the term ""Gay"" meant happy and joyful. The term ""homosexual"" was not even allowed to be mentioned on TV; let alone allow a person of that sort to be depicted. People, of course, knew about such individuals and ""dirty old men""; but the attitude was ""Why show that kind of stuff on TV?"" Most people would have, grudgingly perhaps, admitted that there was a place on TV for artistic nudity, but outright vulgarity was not tolerated whatsoever! Strangely, even in our day and age artistic nudity is still not allowed on open air TV, but vulgarity is and in abundance. Go figure.So, Kubrick had to present this movie properly; no easy task. He did so despite an, at times, awkward performance by James Mason. Compensating for this were incredible performances by Shelly Winters (she acted the role of a romance and sex starved matronly widow that I would not be surprised if, in fact she was- at least sex starved). By the way, the bedroom scene of her with James Mason, though innocent by our standards today, was almost scandalous by the standards of that day and age. Please remember that in the Dick van Dyke show of that era the husband and wife had separate beds in the same bedroom! Peter Sellers was absolutely magnificent in this pre Inspector Jacques Clouseau role and one can certainly see why Kubrick was so eager to use him again in ""Doctor Strangeglove"". Also of great interest was the United States of 1962; when seat belts were not in cars and gas stations were full service. A great look at a past America; shows that not all high school dances ended in a drunken or drug induced sexual orgy. A time when typewriters were used to type letters; not word processors. Actually. one really has to be of a certain age or even older to fully appreciate the nuances in this film though even the younger (under age 45) viewer can appreciate most of it. By the way, Mason got over his ""jitters"" over showing a dirty old man and a few years later was lead male actor in ""Age of Consent""; showing his renewed male appreciation of the lovely and (then young) Helen Mirren. Older man chasing a naked young filly on a tropical beach! A great movie, and so is this one.",Lolita
142,ACitizenCalledKane,"Humorous, disturbing, and everything in between!",7,3 December 2004,"I think Stanley Kubrick was the only director who had any ideas of how to tackle a film version of Lolita. I also believe that he was the only director who could have succeeded, and I believe he did succeed. This film was everything I could have expected it to be, and maybe even a little more.Shelley Winters' performance was wonderful! James Mason delivered a strong effort in a very difficult part to play. Peter Sellers was Peter Sellers, four or five times throughout the movie, but that's Peter Sellers, and that's why I am really starting to admire his work. The real surprise performance in this movie, however, came from Sue Lyon in the title role. Her intensity was incredible. She seemed perfectly natural as a teenage girl enjoying the attention of older men, or just men in general. You could really see the wheels turning in her head as she schemed her way from one situation to the other. Some have criticized that her Lolita was ""too old"" in comparison to the novel's Lolita. One could make that judgment, however, what twelve year old actress would have been able to provide the emotional depth required for the part? Let's face it, in literary adaptations, some license must be allowed. All in all, I thought it was a very good movie, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the work of Stanley Kubrick and/or Peter Sellers.",Lolita
143,kjruk,A portrait of a man who loses control and dignity,8,9 October 2012,"I haven't read the book. I cant imagine the same relationship with a 12 year old. It wouldn't feel or look right in a film. By right I mean it just wouldn't work. By making Lolita older the events are more convincing and possible. If she was 12 he would have looked like a complete half wit or pervert instead of just a pathetic idiot. I love Peter Sellars but I didn't like his role in the film until the end when I realised he really was a pervert. So his behaviour in the film does make sense. Its not about the girl, its more about the psychological destruction of a pathetic, besotted older man who should have known better but gets dragged down into a self destructive finale of his own making. The most shocking thing for me was finding out who the girl actually loved. Even that made sense because at no time does Kubrick make us think we are dealing with anything but a silly brat of a girl who turns out to be much worse than I expected. Its a typically well made film. All the positive comments about the acting and so on I agree with but its not a very uplifting film. I don't know why any of the silly moralists would have a problem with the story as the ending could be seen as a fitting punishment for both men and a warning about even thinking of running away with a 15 year old as just happened here in the UK.",Lolita

It is very rare to find such a movie which highlights all its topics so precisely and all the lead actors have acted superbly. All these characters have become immortal for me.To take up such a controversial book and make a movie editing the sensitive issues without diluting the effect and give a complete satisfaction.. Hats off. Amazing Screenplay and exceptional direction. This movie is simply on another level. You can literally connect with Mr.Humbert and feel his obsession and conservativeness about Lolita. This movie just leaves the end inconclusive to some aspect, like I personally felt what about the playwright, why did he go after Lolita and all?.

145,jwiley-86292,"Close, but no cigar",5,24 February 2017,"Look: This adaptation was appropriate for its era, not this one. I think it's only better-rated than the later Lolita movie because it's a) older and b) from an important director. That it deviates so much from the book acts against it; I think it was rather mean to throw out Nabokov's original screenplay.This is not to say the film has nothing going for it. Sue Lyon's performance definitely warrants existing even alongside Dominique Swain. She lends a seductive classic Hollywood glamour that almost makes the film beautiful. James Mason is serviceable as well--about as hot as an oily- haired classic Hollywood actor is going to get. Unfortunately, when Peter Sellers appears, the film grinds to a screeching halt. I wondered why I was being shown him. Since there is so much from the book they couldn't put in, they replace it with things like. . . a HIGH SCHOOL dance?! We all know she's not in high school! Because of the dawdling, the film comes across as unfinished. If you compare the scene of settling into the hotel room with the corresponding scene in the later film, the dialogue is almost identical except Dolores' line ""The word is incest"" is omitted. That line was in the book. This may not hold up entirely well, but it's not worth getting mad at because we eventually got my favorite movie of all time.

148,returning,A vision-based adaptation.,8,18 June 2004,"Nabokov is very likely the greatest novelist of the 20th century, rivaled only by fellow Russian Bulgakov, yet this film certainly does not fall into the category of over-ambitious director creates transparent and naive surface-level adaptation, (watch virtually any Dostoevsky adaptation and you'll see what I'm talking about).Kubrick was very aware of this danger all throughout his career and he usually remedied it by focusing on one particular theme or device. He cut out sections of ""Barry Lyndon"" that he saw as superfluous to his intentions, and the infamous contraversy over ""The Shining"" came as a result of this as well. In ""Lolita"" he focuses on a particular folding device that Nabokov has become famous for, and the focus becomes on what isn't being shown as opposed to what is shown. There are certainly great performances all around, and some trademark Kubrick angles, but the film's subtlety is the strongest point. I'm not talking about the hand-holding early on or anything of that sort, but note carefully when Kubrick decides to cut the scene. Alot can go on between cut and he uses it to heighten our curiosity and make as put it together ourselves, perhaps like one of the gossip-y neighbors.Despite Mason's competent performance, it's important to notice that his character is relatively dry compared to the novels's temperamental character. Again, a decision made by Kubrick to focus the story on his goal. We must admit a minor amount of over-ambition, but there is enough innovation as Kubrick begins his quest to go from story to vision.4 out 5 - An excellent film",Lolita

154,tonysharp,An unbiased review of the worst Kubrick film I've seen,5,17 May 2008,"Considering how brilliant 2001: A Space Odyssey and Barry Lyndon were, it's kind of hard to imagine Stanley Kubrick making a bad film. Unfortunately, throughout his prolific career, he did make a couple of clunkers, and Lolita is definitely one of them.The comedy was misplaced and unfunny, the creepiness was corny and uncreepy, and the overall mood was as dry as sandpaper. The deepest, and the most artistic, scene in the entire film was the introduction. Aside from that, barely anything was impressive or accessible enough to draw me in. For most of the 2 1/2 hours, I watched each scene lumber by, and barely cared for what I was seeing.Why was Clare Quilty such a front and center character? Was it because Peter Sellers agreed to play the part, and they wanted to see as much of him as possible? Is that why they chose to over-develop his character, give him more lines than anyone, have him play two characters, and stray completely from the poetic chords that made the book so moving? And why was Humbert Humbert's background so under-explained? If you had never read the book, the deeper reasons behind his sickness, and everything else, would be mostly unknown.The story and the character development jumped about with hardly any subtly. For example: Humbert, out of the clear blue, begins to rant about his controlling wife, and a few moments later, he contemplates on ways to kill her with a gun. There were no hints about him having murderous tendencies within the story's chronology, but all of a sudden he does? And there is no sexual tension or chemistry between Humbert and Lolita; you can barely tell that they have a relationship at all. Maybe the 1960s censors are to blame for this. Nevertheless, the relationship still feels very shallow, unbelievable, and unjustified. Why would a beautiful young girl want to have sex with a man who was as old and as ugly as James Mason? This is never explained.As a longtime Kubrick fan, I'm not afraid to say that this film downright sucked. I only give it a 5 out of 10 because it wasn't entirely awful. There were moments when Kubrick's trademark directing and cinematography sparkled through, but, overall, I was extremely disappointed.",Lolita

Peter sellers is hilarious as quilty, he's funny even when he is about to die, sometimes peter sellers appears to have four or five personalities, he's such a great actor. Shelley winters is very good as the mother of Lolita and sue Lyon (Lolita) is excellent. The rest of the cast is OK+. Being a fan of James bond I noticed that in this movie appears Lois Maxwell as a nurse and cec linder as a doctor (moneypenny and Felix leiter in the James bond series).

As a matter of fact, it's a disturbing film if taken literally.However, Kubrick never makes you go down the disturbing path, rather, he tries to lead you down the path of black humor the whole way.Nothing stands out in my mind that I would call 'funny', rather simply, every situation he is in IS funny, because he's helpless to his erotic desires.

Humbert and Charlotte seemed REALLY old. Sue Lyon was perfect as a nubile teen discovering and beginning to wield the sexual power of a woman. Us guys wouldn't stand a chance.Poor Charlotte, widowed mother of Delores Haze (Lolita), is not treated very sympathetically in either novel or film. Humbert Humbert viciously slashes her with his gibes about her intelligence and education, talking over her head. Fate (thanks, Vladimir) has most unkindly widowed her, leaving her to live a financially secure but otherwise empty life and an urn full of her dead husband's ashes. She was still young enough to want more: Romance, love and excitement.As Charlotte Haze, Shelly Winters is brilliant. The same for Kubrick's direction. She garnered my sympathy for the lonely, middle-aged widow as she sat softly crying, alone in her living room after Humbert callously abandons her to go chaperon (read: lust after) Lolita at a High School Prom. I stopped sneering and felt really sorry for her. At the film's end, I felt some compassion for the unlucky-at-love Humbert Humbert, even if he got what he deserved for being such a swine and a damn fool to boot. Both film and book are brilliantly creative and entertaining. Among the standout performances is that of Peter Sellers as Claire Quilty, the bizarre, perverse avenging angel, bent upon raining on the hapless Humbert Humbert's parade. I sincerely hope that there aren't too many Claire Quiltys in the world and that I never become a target.Standout comic scenes: 1. Humbert's execution of Claire Quilty at the beginning of the picture. When the first bullet hits him, Quilty realizes that this is no joke. Up to that point, it was really funny.2. Charlotte's maudlin confession of her romance with Humbert to the urn containing her late husband's ashes. On a sad note, she excoriates him for dying and abandoning her.3. The bedroom scene in the motel, in which the porter tries to quietly deploy the uncooperative roll-away bed for Humbert, so as to avoid waking the sleeping Lolita.4. In the book: Charlotte's written love note is proffered to Humbert. Discovering it, he chortles with delight and good fortune. In the book, Charlotte imagined that her note was probably thrown in the ""vortex of the toilet."" That made Humbert laugh even more. To be sure, Nabokov had a mean streak, if not outright misogyny.Over the years I have enjoyed Nabokov's work. Except for ADA, which I found frothy and completely inscrutable.",Lolita
162,OdinsRagnarok,A slow movie that's afraid of it's own story,5,16 November 2020,"Many call this a classic, and it undoubtedly was (still is) a very controversial and touchy topic to make a movie about. Although it doesn't translate well, as the actress doesn't seem like a 12 year old at all she is supposed to portray. Rendering a lot of the controversy hollow. In many ways, it seems a bit brushed over, as if the studio were afraid to explore the topic the movie was about.Humbert and Lolita are acted well, despite the shortcomings mentioned above. But a lot of this movie is extremely slow where you're forced to endure quite cringy conversations and situations for the slow paced story to progress.This was the last of Kubrick's movies I had not seen, having been a fan of his movies for decades. And as current standing, I would also say it is his worst. It really haven't aged well, which I would say is a huge contrast to Dr.Strangelove from the same era - which still holds up.",Lolita
163,gonzalodacruzabreu,Lot to say,7,27 September 2021,"First... the movie is entertaining, a bit boring sometimes, I think because of the 2 hours and a half.Kubrick really gets what he wants, to feel lolita is loved by everyone.Something I'm sure is going to happen to everyone who watch the film: You don't know what to think about Humbert!! He's obsessed, but loves her, he doesn't allow her to go anywhere but he gives her money and services... Anyway! I'd say I was always changing my thoughts about this and Quilty's character while the film was developing.The final thing I understood, is that Quilty was other adult fallen in love and admiration with Lolita, just as Humbert, so you finally get that these people were all involved in Lolita's life, in a bad way, being ""toxic"" and bad references...

164,ghostninjafire,The restrictive 60's,7,29 September 2013,"This movie was destined to have problems in a society as restrictive as the U.S. in the 60s. How to make a film capable of presenting this issue without being interdicted? First eliminate the presence of any sexual expression and then, transform it into a tragicomedy. And, just because he needed to explore the gifts of Peter Sellers' comedy, Kubrick is forced to deviate from the book in these scenes. What Kubrick makes in this movie in terms of masking a reality socially offensive is simply phenomenal. If films are to be based on works of literature, this is the way to do it, and the way it is almost never done.",Lolita

167,moviola-2,Best Lolita ever,10,16 January 1999,"An excellent film that has Kubrik's name stamped all over it.We see how the skillful Director is able to translate and adapt the book to reach a bigger audience and become a timeless Classic.Rather than worry about truly reflecting the book on the silver screen, Kubrik changes and experiments with the screenplay to obtain a refreshing, intellectual and fun version of the boring Nabokov's novel.The Master of Directors shows also great skill in his precise direction of the well selected star cast.Who would challenge that Sellers is precisely the hyperactive, witty character who could undoubtedly seduct a young teen. Could there be a better fit to Lolita's mother than Shelley Winters, who conveys so well the impression of being the desperate, lonely widow?Even James Mason IS the perfect sexually repressed, intellectual pervert, who tries to hide so well his persistent, hypocritical thoughts and desires behind that mask of academic honorability.In conclusion, this is not a replacement for the book. It is also true that to bring the book to life a boring multi-part mini-series would be necessary. This is, however, a better screenplay than the one we saw on the 1997 version.",Lolita

The ending gives it a wry twist, but it doesn't really fit in with the rest of the mood and setting of the film.  It would probably have been better if the scene had been chopped out of the final cut, but it does offer a suspenseful to those who allow themselves to be fully sucked into the characters.",Lolita

170,s-neaverson,Never has there been a more deeply unlikeable character than Professor Humbert Humbert,2,17 July 2012,"Lolita begins emphatically, with an engrossing scene between two heavyweight actors as James Mason turns up invited into Peter Seller's house. Unfortunately, the film never lives up to it's electrifying opening and it's a constant downhill trek after that. The film sags and moors as it struggles to justify it's ridiculous plot turns and unbearable character.The film has a hugely controversial premise, focusing on a professor's obsession with a 14 year old girl. As the film progresses and his desire for her increases, we never really understand why, his obsession is never duly justified or explained. Lolita seems to exude no magical qualities and the only conclusion is the professor must be a paedophile. The fact he never acts kind to anyone and turns to acts of cruelty and degradation doesn't help his cause.Due to strict censoring, Stanley Kubrick, the director, could not include some of the scenes in the book which help to explain their relationship. Instead he must turn to innuendo and implied acts, though these never really have any effect. Obviously this wasn't Kubrick's fault, but it still falls to him that the film never truly reaches out to you.Lolita is a film with no emotional backbone. It follows a deeply unlikeable character in a quest for something we don't ever want him to have. Who wants to see that?",Lolita
171,dckennedy,Still a stunner after 50 years,10,8 April 2011,"It's not the book, but both Nabokov and Kubrick knew that they couldn't film the novel as it was. So Nabokov brilliantly adapted his own book, making an essentially new story out of it, bringing Quilty to the fore and giving Peter Sellers an amazing opportunity to get ready for Dr. Strangelove. Sue Lyon's performance is remarkable for its unforced, perfect teen mix of turmoil, boredom, and teasing.The novel is a tragedy, with Humbert as a brilliant, creepy, narcissistic monster for whom Lolita isn't a stepdaughter, but a twisted fantasy. While a largely passive victim in the novel, in the movie, Lolita is older and more able to defend herself and end up on top, so to speak. Humbert is obsessed with criminal thoughts, but not a criminal in act. Movies by their nature have to be more realistic or naturalistic, and modernist experiments like the novel tend to not fit the medium. Thus the tale was retold as an near-consummated obsession, and the villainy is shifted to Quilty, who becomes the real criminal in place of Humbert. Lolita dies at the end of the novel; not so in the film. Rather Quilty dies in her place after the transposition from book to cinema.There are some myths floating around about the original Lolita, which can be quickly dispelled by reading any decent study or history of the film. While Sue Lyon was a remarkable 14/15-year-old actress, she's supposed to be 16 in the film when she first meets Humbert, and 19 in the final scene. (In the novel, she's 12 and 16, respectively.) There was no US film rating system at the time, and most films for general release had to fit the Hays code or something like it. (There were no R- or X-rated films in 1962, although there was an underground of low-grade porn shorts.) Nabokov's decision to adapt the novel himself stemmed from his belief that, if someone was going to butcher the story, he should do it himself. Because the film was made in the UK, Kubrick had to satisfy just one censor, the British film board, which in effect became a collaborator.The film is full of brilliant gags that repay close attention. (Who is Vivian Darkbloom, and what does her name really mean?) Also worth close attention is Nabokov's incisive portrait of the then-new American teenager. Pray tell, in the film, are not Humbert or Charlotte the abused, and their precious baby the casual abuser?",Lolita
172,Mr. Gore,A failed adaptation of a classic novel,1,4 September 1998,"The tag line, ""How did they ever make a movie of Lolita?"" seems appropriate because, in short, the answer is that they didn't. Kubrick, for all his touted genius, didn't come close to capturing the book on film. It hardly seems to have much to do with Nabokov at all, instead being off the subject and its own unique creature. Although some films can (and should) be viewed as divorced from their source material, I find it difficult to regard this production without comparing it to Nabokov's creation. I wonder why Kubrick interpreted it this way. Putting aside the possible controversy a faithful adaptation may have caused, Kubrick chose to emphasize the satirical elements and update it to 1960s culture. Of course, Lolita is aged a few years to make the relationship less shocking. As played by Sue Lyon (who looks much older), she comes off as a typical '60s teeny-bopper heroine. Kubrick seems to want to parody other movies of this period and the activities of that society and set. The music here is atrocious, especially the annoying love theme, which resembles swinging go-go music of the era.The story wanders all over the place, hardly devoting enough time to central relationship between Humbert Humbert and Lolita. The plot is slight and unfocused, preferring to diverge off into subplots that distract from the main story and themes. When the occasional scene does follow the book (many occur in a strange, seemingly random-chosen fashion), it appears almost jarringly out of place with the rest of the action. By incorporating too many elements of diffuse black humor, the comic and poignant obsession angle is considerably diluted. The film is also hampered by poor performances by all the major players save Peter Sellers. James Mason is especially weak as Humbert, Shelley Winters is unequivocally annoying, and Sue Lyon is a completely uninteresting disappointment. Sellers' character of Quilty is allowed to dominate the movie so much, I questioned whether this was supposed to be his story. The Quilty character, which was essentially a minor through pervasive presence in the novel, is brought to the forefront here, and Sellers improvises wildly to create a particularly overshadowing creep. As a movie on its own, perhaps the Kubrick version works on some level, but it fails as an adaptation of Nabokov's novel.",Lolita

I think it was very funny in the part when Lolita and Humbert are in the hotel room and he is trying to set up his bed and it just collapses. The movie doesn't show any sex. I liked the performances by Mason, Lyon, Sellers and Winters and the opening sequence of the painting of the toenails. This was one of Kubrick's daring films like A Clockwork Orange. ***1/2 out of ****",Lolita
174,camcmahon,"'Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins.'",7,16 March 2005,"Having just read Vladmir Nabokov's 'Lolita' for Uni, I instantly wanted to see Stanley Kubrick's rendering of the story. Overall I was impressed by what he had done, but I felt some parts of the film didn't quite work. Firstly, although i think Sellers is a great actor and I love him in everything I've seen him in I just couldn't get comfortable with his role here. When reading the book I had a totally different vision of Quilty, so I found it hard to readjust to Seller's performance. Although his acting is great and hilarious as always, it just didn't fit into the plot for me. I thought James Mason was good, and he played the gradual disintegration of Humbert Humbert with an intensity which i enjoyed. However, i felt that the film did not reveal as much of his character as the novel portrays. The name Humbert Humbert suggests two sides to his nature, and I felt that too much emphasis was placed on his suave and intelligent side, and not enough time was devoted to his burning desire and passion for Lolita. I particularly missed one of my favourite lines that was not used in film, 'Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.' Although i haven't seen the film in a long time, I think Jeremy Irons from the 1997 version is a much better actor for the role.Sue Lyon made a great Lolita, although she did tremble on the line between looking young enough for the role and looking too old for it. Still, there were times in the film where she looked so young the odious nature of Humbert's act really struck me. Speaking of this, I felt the film skipped past too much of what really went on between Humbert and Lolita. Although Nabokov similarly leaves this to the reader's imagination, I thought a little more could have been done to stress the nature of Humbert and Lolita's relationship.Shelley Winters was brilliant, and her acting added so much to the character of Charlotte Haze. I thought she was wonderful; she really fleshed the character out.Overall, I did enjoy watching this film despite the small niggles I had with it, but I view it as something separate to the novel. In this way it's a more enjoyable experience. I'm looking forward to seeing the 1997 version of the film again (I saw it once years ago!), as I think it is a movie that will benefit much more having been made in a time of a more permissive society, allowing more creative freedom in what can be shown.",Lolita
175,Ed Bone,Great movie because its a great script,8,24 June 2000,"I've seen both versions of Lolita, which are remarkably the same, and one thing seems certain to me.  The movie is great because the script is great. In this version James Mason does a great job as Humbert Humbert, that cannot be denied.  But the frustration he is acting on is wholly a result of a terrific novel and screenplay written by Vladimir Nabokov.  That is apparent as Sue Lyon seems very appealing as Lolita, but I don't think in reality she does nearly as good a job as Dominique Swain in her portrayal of Lolita for the 1992 version of the film.  Overall, see the movie, but pay close attention to all the detail and design that's written into the script, and less to the actors.  It'll make the movie that much better.",Lolita

I detested James Mason's Humbert Humbert to such a degree that stopped me from accepting him in other roles other than utter villains. To see it now after two decades is a whole other story - All of a sudden James Mason's Humbert Humbert has become human, very human. Corrupt and haunted by the awareness of his own weakness. What a performance. Shelley Winters is superb, unafraid and bold bringing to life an embarrassing human spectacle. What a performance. Peter Sellers is chilling in all of his Quilty incarnations.

I couldn't rent it anywhere, 'till one day i stepped in the library and i went to their video section. And yes, they had it, Lolita. I was very happy to have found it, cause i had already read the novel by Vladimir Nabokov, which made a big impression on me, though sometimes i had to force myself to reading it. When i saw the movie, it was everything i hoped it would be when i read the novel. The images and environment that Kubrick put on film were exactly the same as the visual world that I created in my mind while I was reading the book. The actors were perfectly cast and the whole atmosphere, ambiance and tension, that Kubrick created in his film, felt exactly like they felt in the book.The screenplay could not have been written better by the master himself. When someone has read the book they'll know what i mean when i say that it seems almost impossible to make a film of it. The book is so complex, psychological and plays at so many different levels, that on screen, people wouldn't be able to make sense out of it. But the screenplay that Nabokov wrote was a lot more accesible and could therefore reach a bigger audience.The controversial novel was talked about a lot in its time and i think Stanley Kubrick, always controversial and provocative, was the perfect director to make a film out of it. And he did. The theme of sexual obsession is handled very subtle, but it IS being handled, and that gives the film the tension and controverse that we find in all of Kubrick's films.The film made a big impression on me, as the book did, but even more, they made the same impression on me, which satisfied me a great deal.Great film of a great book.",Lolita
180,whorrinhatch,"Flawed, but one of Kubrick's best",8,14 February 2002,"This film is more visually subtle than most of Kubrick's later work, which I think is a good thing. James Mason, Shelley Winters and Sue Lyon all turn out wonderful performances that give Nabokov's characters new life. One of the major problems a lot of people have with this film is that it's oftentimes unfaithful to the book, which is a silly thing to complain about. Is it really possible to be completely faithful to a massive novel in a two hour film? I do agree, however, that the character of Quilty is over-emphasized and Peter Sellers' performance leaves much to be desired. Sellers' comically overacted Quilty seems to interrupt the narrative flow far too often. His performance is a preveiw of the excellent work he does in Kubrick's ""Dr. Strangelove..."", but it seems very out of place here. In the end, it's the well constructed narrative, along with Kubrick's small touches (the dancing scene at the beginning comes to mind) that make this film for me. It's definitely one of Kubrick's most coherent and skillful films.",Lolita
181,potoko0204,Do I have the Lolita complex? May contain SPOILERS,9,15 June 2004,"What can I say about this movie? Passionate, funny, out of the ordinary, yet so familiar.  It is a feeling that I am guessing all men have experienced once in their life time: Being with a Lolita.  Based on Vladimir Nabokov's novel, the story of Lolita has been marvelously portrayed by Sue Lyon under the guidance of one of the most acclaimed directors of our time: Stanley Kubrick.  The beginning of the movie, where Humbert Humbert (played by James Mason) is looking for the character of Peter Sellers, and kills him, I did not understand it at first.  But as the movie progressed, it gave out hints, subtle but yet so clear hints about the situation in a movie.  Lolita is full of sexual innuendos that are so subtly placed in every corner of the movie, that I was honestly blown by the ending.  I am pretty harsh on many movies, and I am a hard viewer to please, but for some reason, Stanley Kubrick's movies seem to surpass my expectations.

Unlike the book, he has no proper motives for his action, nor is he smart enough to be impressive.2. Sue Lyon is too old to play Dolores. There are no nuances in the character, there is nothing unusual about her. And because she is too old, you don't feel a lot of sympathy for her either.3. This may sound biased, since i have read the book, but Peter Sellers seems irrelevant. He shows up times that does not add up to the action and removes a lot of substance from the plot.4. Back to the start, this is the wrong Way to tell a frame story. You care less about the main character, since you see only darkness, which shrouds all the nuances.Avoid this, poor script, poor acting and poor storytelling.

183,mink-3,Comparision of Kubrick's and Lynne's Lolita,10,3 October 1998,"A week ago I had the displeasure of seeing Adrian Lynn's version of Lolita, which renewed my respect for Kubrick's genius as an artist and a social commentator. He had the vision to use the story for issues that were relevant to his time, rather than allowing himself to be constrained by the world as presented in the novel. Now this is not to say that the novel was lacking in any regard whatsoever, but that Kubrick's directing made it apparent that Nabokov wrote timeless, almost archetypal characters and a story which could resonate in any place or time.  His directing is nothing short of genius as we can see in the pacing, the effectiveness of each and every scene, the superb portrayals of every character, and the way he nails the tragic-comedic tone of the novel. The worst that can be said is that he uses the novel as an excuse for social commentary, but Lynne's Lolita draws the opposite conclusion- he blatantly ignores the tone and socio-political aspects, using the novel solely as an excuse for pornography. Lynne's direction is of the poorest standard as the scenes drag on for minutes beyond the ""point"" has (or in this case, has not) been made, and the performances are all substandard. It is a shame so many ferverently believe that Lynne's adaptation is truer to the novel, because this view devalues Nabokov's artistry and contribution to literature.  Besides which Nabokov wrote the screenplay for Kubrick's Lolita, and even though he felt the film differed from his novel, he was quite pleased with the result. Certainly the same dare not be said for Lynne's version.",Lolita

What triggered this was the thought ""he really loved her."" I give credit to James Mason for that (James, sublime in the bathtub scene). These days, I watch the film again every few years, and though I've never gotten back that original reaction, I love it (with the exception of the business with the folding bed--it's just too tedious, however metaphorical). Peter Sellers (""right in the boxing glove"") is constantly hilarious, the clown who drops in from time to time hardly dominates the movie as so many people say. Sue Lyon is also perfect in her role (too bad if she's older than in the book--the book has an entirely different tone). She is complex, not the innocent victim: what could be more boring than a film about an innocent victim? Shelley Winters (who is really quite attractive but willing to make herself ridiculous and gloriously annoying) could not be funnier.

The most disappointing performance in this film is ""Lolita"" herself! There was never a moment in the film when I believed that she believed or understood what she was doing, thinking or feeling...on any level! With a cast that included James Mason, Shelly Winters and Peter Sellers it borders on madness that Sue Lyons performance was allowed to suffice!

187,crakatoot,Kurbrick's Underrated Masterpiece,10,28 March 2017,"Kurbrick was one of the greatest film makers of all time. His attention to detail and his meticulous style is rarely seen in films today. It was rarely seen in his day too. The down side of his perfectionist nature thought, was that he didn't make many films. Still he did make a few classics in his day. Films like A Clockwork Orange, 2001, Paths of Glory, Dr. Strangelove and The Shinning. One film that often gets overlooked though, is Lolita.This film is different. The tagline is ""How Did they Ever Make a Movie Out of Lolita."" The plot is this, Prof. Humbert Humbert comes to America, rents a house, meets the landlady's young nymphet daughter, falls instantly in love and purses her, rather relentlessly. So yes the plot of this story is rather unconventional. Kubrick has gone on record saying, that if he knew the kind of limitations there would be, that he wouldn't have even bothered making the movie. Basically with the censors of the day, the relationship between Humbert and Lolita couldn't be shown or talked about in any real way. Now this movie came out in 1962 and to keep things in context, you should remember that in the 1950's married couples on TV and movies were shown sleeping in separate beds at night. So the idea of showing a man in his 50's sleeping with a young girl (the actress who played Lolita, Sue Lyon was only 14 at the time) was pretty much out of the question. And while some might see this as a major problem, it really isn't. The relationship, while never out right admitted, is alluded to, a lot. They say it without actually saying it.The real strength of this movie though, is the actors. James Mason plays Humbert perfectly. His character oozes aristocratic disdain and disgust for everything around him. Especially Shelly Winters, that's the landlady. That is, until he sees Lolita. Once he sets his eyes on her, that's it. While his intentions are a little repulsive, he pursues them with such a dogged genuine determination, you do sympathize with him a bit.And Sue Lyon was absolutely perfect as Lolita. The way she carries herself, the way she talks, the way she teases Humbert. On the one hand it seems like she knows exactly what she is doing. She knows the effect she has on him and she seems to love toying with him. Although, on the other hand, she might just be a teenager fooling around. With her character it is very hard to tell. One scene, she seems wise beyond on her age and in the next she is carrying on like petulant child.And of course we have Shelly Winters, one of the most underrated actress of all time. And yes her character, Lolita's mother, is very shrill and annoying. That was kind of Shelly Winters bread and butter, but she was supposed to be shrill an annoying. An obstacle for Humbert to get past. Still, Shelly Winters brought such a wounded vulnerability to her character. This is a woman who lost her husband, is not very bright and her new tenant Humbert is uh kind of problematic. There is one scene where she breaks down and it is truly heartbreaking.This film is also filled with Kubrick's usual cinematic flair. There are so many little things hidden in the visuals that you don't notice at first but make the film much richer on repeat viewings.This film is not without its flaws however. It does drag a bit in the middle. And there is way, way to much of Peter Sellers. Kubrick was such a meticulous director with his shot and his sets and especially his actors. But for whatever reason, he gave Sellers way to much leeway. Now this did work in Dr. Strangelove, where Sellers had to play all these different characters, but here, where he just plays the character Clare Quilty, all these different voices and mannerisms he keeps using, it's just distracting. And a little annoying. Kurbrick definitely should have rained Sellers in.Besides those few flaws, this film is truly a classic. It deserves to be ranked right alongside all of Kubrick's other classic films. It's the kind of film, where one scene your laughing, the next scene your skin is crawling.That's the power of Lolita",Lolita

Young nymphets for a long time cause in the adult man a mixed scale of feelings and desires, in which he is afraid to admit to himself. An abomination in one word!I do not understand what Stanley Kubrick attracted in this book? What could make him film it? Although we must pay tribute to Kubrick, that he did not show showed a single love scene, throughout the film we will not see a single kiss. But then another question appears, why does she need it? Throughout the film, we see how hard it is to use poor Humbert, and he gets nothing in return.From this film, we understand that all women are mercenary and evil!The film, like the book for perverts, and no one in the world will convince me that passion for women is normal.",Lolita
189,JoshJDS,A brilliant cerebral adaption that's trademark Kubrick,10,8 October 1998,"When this ""Lolita"" came out in 1962, Variety reported it was like ""a bee with its stinger removed"".  Obviously, the reviewer didn't pay close attention to the film.  While the sexual content has been almost entirely removed, and Lolita's age has been upped from 12 to 16, this film still packs a wallop.  Between Kubrick's and Lyne's separate adaptions of the novel, neither one is the ""definitive"" version.  Kubrick's stresses the beginning of the film, mainly Humbert Humbert's relationship with Charlotte Haze, and then Humbert at Beardsley college.  James Mason is brilliant as Humbert, and Shelley Winters is chilling as Charlotte.  Sue Lyon plays Lolita, but I'm still undecided about the performance; it is either extremely bad or extremely good, but I'm finding it hard to tell.  The role of Clare Quilty has been augmented, and Peter Sellers portrays it brilliantly.  This film is filled with black humor, wit, and much more is suggested than ever shown, so it will probably be necessary to watch it at least twice before evaluating it.  On a final note, this adaption of the two is ""colder""; we see Humbert, but we have trouble understanding him, and it is possible that James Mason was having trouble interpreting the character, perhaps due to rumored script rewrites throughout the production by Kubrick re-doing Nabokov's work.",Lolita

Maybe because they're already imprinted in my mind, but I can't imagine another possible Quilty than Peter Sellers, or Humbert than James Mason. Shelley Winters goes all the WAY over the top in a way that was perfect for the role. & Sue Lyon was erotic & sexy & KNOWING in a way I've never seen from an actress so young.

193,Stalina,Cynically romantic,10,23 March 2002,"Having read the Nabokov novel and the two well-known versions of the film, I believe the most accurate way of defining the relations is: Lyne´s film is more faithful to the literal reading of the story, Kubrick's one is far more faithful to its spirit and, what is even more important, it isn't drowned by comparisons with the book.Probably what bothers most people who have seen both films and read the novel is that Kubrick gives ample space to cynicism, farce and mocking of all the main (and even secondary) characters: it ridicules both the cultured, refined and cosmopolitan Englishman and the pseudo-liberal and fairly tacky Americans (the cultural and behavioral differentiation reminding me of Henry James, just in reverse). The child temptress is here seen more realistically as a sexy however vacuous and irritating teenager and Humbert´s love of her as a noble and real but tremendously stupid infatuation (coming from a cold-headed intellectual like him). Also delightful the portrayal of alcoholic and neurotic Shelley Winters, and particularly of Peter Sellers as a mediocre tv writer enhanced by American middle-class culture. There is a lot of witty sociopolitical criticism here.Adrian Lynne's version, being utterly romantic (and striving really too hard to be poetic) may seem more accurate on the love story but is really Nabokov's intention to tell a love story as such? I can't really appreciate how such wonderful novelist could be so obvious and open to his reader. Not forgetting the romanticism of Humbert's feelings of despair towards the girl, Kubrick doesn't indulge in a simple love story but explores all the most obscure consequences of irrationality and does so with irony and sarcasm (humour is everywhere) but also with a touch of compassionate dramatism when appropriate.We have a classic here, both faithful to the novel and full of innovations. Lynne´s intent is merely a limp follower of its two (the literary and the filmic) predecessors.",Lolita
194,andreyev66,"Funny, at times farcical, and heart-breaking",10,29 March 2000,"Kubrick brilliantly dramatizes the madness inherent to love in general and illicit love in particular. James Mason is extraordinary as Humbert Humbert, the film's slyly duplicitous and heartbreakingly earnest hero who canneither win nor keep his beloved ""Lo"". And Peter Sellers is nearly as good as Quigley, Humbert's rival and the quintessence of early sixties' decadent cool. Seeing him in Strangelove and this film, and later in Being There, one wonders at what he might had accomplished had he decided not to churn out those wretched Pink Panthers.But back to the issue at hand. Despite a few bumps along the way, this is a great film, hilarious, tragic, subversive, and lest I forget, sexy.",Lolita

198,Mr-Fred,Less is more,9,21 February 2007,"Let me start by saying that I have not read the book, nor seen the remake. That maybe the reason why I like this film so much - no distractions.The key to this film is the likability of the main character Humbert. James Mason gives a tastefully reluctant performance as the ""dirty, old man"". Kubrick's film is also one of the best examples of voice-over narration leading to likability. He is talking to you, therefore you can't hate him. Also, there is a second villain, played by Peter Sellers. Him, you hate, even though he is very funny.Sue Lyon's performance is wonderfully complex and realistic. One moment she is teasing, the next she is moralizing.Kubrick takes a minimalistic approach to the taboo subject. Everything is under the surface. We can only thank him for that.",Lolita
199,nat-horne,Well made movie that is surprisingly good and surprisingly relevant.,9,28 July 2008,"Lolita is a surprisingly good film. Mason gives a terrific performance in the lead role, managing to show how pathetic his character is whilst still getting a little sympathy. Lyon and Winters are perfect in their contrasting roles that explore two very different and fascinating female characters and the great Peter Sellers gives another performance that is both funny and intriguing at the same time. I liked that (in my opinion) Kubrick's direction of the film didn't overshadow the other aspects of the movie and we could still notice how great the acting and screenplay was. The music was also brilliant and added to the film's sense of absurdity that it often had. It was great how the movie managed to mix the dramatic and comic throughout. Overall though, I think that what makes the film most interesting is it's exploration of sexuality and human nature and the fact that it explores personal situations which are sadly still (perhaps even more so) socially relevant.",Lolita
200,azevedobandeira,the most ridiculous thing,10,4 April 2006,"Nabokov's novel ""Lolita"" is definitely a satire. Kubrick made some changes and created one of the most beautiful black comedies ever.How can you even imagine that you could make a film about Lolita AFTER the perfection in itself and for itself : Stanley Kubrick's Lolita ? How can you think that you could create a compelling drama (and, obviously, Lyne wanted to make a drama ?!!!) out of a story about a man who is sexually attracted to children ? The premise of this movie is absolutely ridiculous. You just can't present a story about a man who wants to have sex with a twelve years old girl as a love story and a drama.",Lolita
201,plasmawisp6633,The book's better.,6,14 July 2010,"The primary appeal of Nabokov's Lolita is the narrative style, and what it reveals about Humbert as a character. When entering the medium of film, I would say that it's almost impossible to convey the entire character of Humbert without the narration. Unfortunately, and it pains me to say this, Kubrick didn't even come close. It's most easily understood that this movie got all of the plot line of Lolita, but none of the substance behind it.This movie focuses on only one real role of Humbert and that is Humbert the father. In the book, it is impossible to picture Humbert as JUST a father; he is also a justified pedophile, a nymphologist, a cultured intellectual, and most importantly, a murderer. Nabokov left the murder scene for last in the novel in order to demonstrate a build-up of malaise in Humbert. When Kubrick put the murder scene first, it makes it easy to forget by the time you reach the conclusion of the film that Humbert is capable of murder.Not only is the development of Humbert neglected, but so is Lolita's. When we encounter Lolita as a pregnant 18-year-old in the book, Nabokov paints the scene with Lolita being a much more mature and developed character. Kubrick, however, portrays her as the same 12-year-old we spent the movie with.I also can't blame everything on Kubrick. Cultural trends at the time of the movie didn't exactly allow for the full exposition of ALL the vulgar subject matter contained in the novel. Quite frankly, the ""sex with minors"" theme was so kept under the surface, I probably would have completely missed it had I not read the novel first. Lolita's a ballsy story put on the silver screen, and it takes a filmmaker with guts to even think of making it. I thought someone like Kubrick would be that kind of film maker, but its possible that he was just 20 or 30 years too early when we made this film.The movie itself is completely average, and not anything to shout about. However, context is important. With knowledge that this is based on an unforgettable piece of literature, it greatly degrades the movie. Read the book folks.",Lolita
202,kevinb_emcee,"Great Director, Great Characters, Fascinating Story!",9,7 December 2001,"Lolita is a fascinating study of two characters, a teenage girl (a minor) and her much older ""boyfriend"" (an adult) and their strange and somewhat twisted relationship, where sex is obviously occurring.  I agree with another reviewer in that it's amazing this film was even made back in 1962, considering the subject matter.The acting is superb, the characters are very compelling in their strangeness, and the plot thickens (slowly by modern standards) in a luscious and delicious way as we watch James Mason's character grapple with the growing independence of his young girlfriend.  Most disturbing is a scene in which Mason gives a pedicure.  You'll enjoy this film with Kubrick's great directing and Mason's ability to capture the strength and pathetic emotions of a man out of control!",Lolita
203,rickmantler,Has Anybody Noticed Sellers Cracking Up Mason?,10,27 April 2008,"I noticed that during Peter Sellers hysterical turn as Dr. Zempf, you can see both Sellers and James Mason nearly crack up at one point. Kubrick obviously opted to keep the take.I think it is roughly at 1:48 when this happens. It isn't a long scene, so seeing this for yourself wouldn't be too time consuming an exercise.I'm surprised this doesn't show up anywhere as a ""goof"".There's another ""near crack up"" just like this in Dr. Strangelove caused yet again by Sellers. The guy you can see failing to contain his laughter is that huge bald Russian-looking dude that is standing (I think) to the left of Sellers in a wheelchair- somewhat spotlighted.",Lolita
204,amherster,A not-made-for-a-book movie.,8,4 February 2003,"Contains Spoiler Lolita would never have been successful as a movie, if Kubrick had stuck strictly to the book.  She was too young in the book, for a movie that had any broad appeal with the class, comedy, suspense, and tragedy mixed together the way this one has.  The increase in age to 16-ish, made it much more believable, and enjoyable.  I don't need to be reminded of Michael Jackson any more than I already am.  This Kubrick classic is a good lesson for men the world over to see, so as to know how not to act when that coquette comes a-calling, for both themselves and the naive coquette's benefit.  The expression of cunning greed and total disregard for Humbert's pain (or pleasure) on her face near the end of the movie when he has handed her the cash, and she looks from the money up to his face to search it for a clue as to how much more she can milk away, and bites her lip a bit, speaks volumes about the more sordid nature that most men and women are able to suppress, but that nevertheless lies within.  What a great twist that the self-absorbed cad Humbert cruelly thinks of the trusting, kind-hearted, semi-attractive Charlotte as a ""cow"", and in the end, he's the one who ends up getting thoroughly milked.  Interesting how no one really wins in this situation that was brought about because immoral passions about cherry pies were indulged in.  We wind up with three dead, and an unhappy Lolita, resigned to a life in Alaska, perhaps having at last discovered the link between fidelity and happiness.  It is sad that we the species keep offering and biting that apple.  Neither the biter or the offerer ever comes out very far ahead.  8/10",Lolita
205,Zyankali,"Uhh, superb!",9,29 December 2012,"I have recently bought the Stanley Kubrick visionary filmmaker collection box that includes a Blu Ray version of ""Lolita"". I am not familiar with Vladimir Nabokov's novel, but the movie is splendid. I consider this a highlight of film noir cinema. The movie centers the obsession of a middle-aged man upon a 14 year teenage girl. The acting is superb, especially by James Mason as Humbert Humbert who is likely to be stuck in midlife crisis. As he was looking for a room to let he just got acquainted with his ""lolita"" by name Dolores Haze. She is the gorgeous daughter of Charlotte Haze, a bumptious, status-seeking, 40-something householder (the slang refers to a cougar) who was about to rent a free room in her house. Charlotte asked her new tenant to look after her young daughter with whom she had a strained relationship. Time went on and Humbert became more and more obsessed with Lolita but also had to resist the sexual proposals of his landlady () I do not intend to spoiler too much here. The story telling is marvelous. Humbert's infatuation with the girl reached his climax as Lolita confessed her love to him. He increasingly made severe attempts to control Lolita's daily life due to his jealousy and he began to lose self-control and stability. If you are watching the movie you will fast realize that the catastrophe must have soon befallen. Lolita was playing with Humbertand Humbert couldn't bear up the complicated love story. I do not purpose to tell you more than necessary, and hope to awake your interest. Watch this movie – I highly recommend it! One of the best i have ever seen.",Lolita
206,HeugeneB,The best version of Lolita,10,28 March 2013,"To get the full genius of Vladimer Nabokov's great work ( not Ada, which he apparently hoped would be considered his magnum Opus) Read the novel, see Kubrick's version, read Nabokov's attempts to put back in what Kubrick cut out, see the later version with Jeremy Irons, which is somewhat more faithful to the work ( Iron's voice is as rich and mellifluous in its own way as Mason's). Here Lolita seems much more like a wayward kid, caught between childhood and adolescence. Then you might capture perhaps 50% of its verbal magic.As to Kubrick's film--it's brilliant in its own way. However, the screenplay-by credit should have said, ""suggested by""). Mason's performance: complex, pathetic, creepy, furious (as childish & Whiny as Sue Lyon's at times) is funny and disgusting to hear.Lyons is too old and used looking in the beginning, too young at the end, despite the hairdo, the casual housewife clothes, the distended belly. I missed what she says at the end to Humbert in the novel: ""You only broke my life, he broke my heart."" Shelley Winter's Charlotte Haze is right up there with Mason's, and Sellers is brilliant, too brilliant but out of context, a one man show: Kubrick loves Seller's identity games so much he can't let go of them. Think of how much could have added in their place. Overall, Jeremy Irons as Humbert, Frank Langella as Quilty, and Melanie Griffith's Charlotte (an apt imitation of Winters) are closer to the mark. That film puts back in the suspense of who Quilty was, and is properly only revealed to us at the end.As for the sex. Kubrick threw out all sexual play (or work on Lolita's part) or didn't bother to film it because of pre-censorship and substituted stupid farces like the day-bed collapse that Humbert Humbert and the porter go through --the worst 10 minutes in the movie, or painting her toenails and staring at her with hungry, lustful eyes while she sleeps. The primary sequence I recall from Kubrick's version is Humbert crawling on the floor of the hospital, wildly, screaming in emotional pain, then turning utterly craven for fear of being found out(the price pedophiles pay for their guilty pleasures I guess. He is utterly defeated when he realizes that he has lost his Lolita once and for all. From the later film I remember the girl jumping distractedly on his lap (really his fully aroused junk) a child/woman caught in his web. From the novel? Nabokov's first words with their wondrous, very sensual alliterative rhythms. (No one but Humbert calls her Lolita publicly so it threw me off when this personal endearment was used by all the adults in Humbert's life):""Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. Lo. Lee. Ta..She was Lola in slacks...Dolly at school...Dolores on the dotted line...Plain Lo in the morning...Lola in slacks. But in my arms she was always Lolita.""",Lolita

The acting in this film was awesome, Mason especially shined as the neurotic/obsessed middle aged man. Hard to fathom that Shelly Winters was once relatively thin and attractive. I always pictured her as the fat woman on the Poseidon Adventure who has a heart attack and dies. I couldn't help but notice the similarity between the sunglasses that Lyone wears and the sunglasses that were later used by the young nymphet in the movie ""The Crush"" which obviously must tip it's hat to it's predecessor. I think the subject matter was handled much better by American Beauty, but then again I am highly partial to that movie. Probably all of us middle aged men can somewhat identify with the character Mason portrays, we just choose to do nothing about it. Middle aged crisis didn't get a name for no reason. Men, like women, will do anything to convince themselves that they are still attractive, and age is not an issue.",Lolita

Even though I despised him after reading the book, blamed him for having snatched Lolita away from Humbert, I somehow couldn't continue to fuel this vehement hatred after watching the film. Oh, the way he delivers each line with the subtle, almost comedic aura of a madman genius. I simply loved the part where he read Humbert's ""dang darn good"" poetry at the very beginning. Reminds me of a more intellectual Mr bean =) But anyhow, apart from the delightful bits, I suppose it will still be better if you take time off to read the book: preferably before you watch the movie, and you won't regret it.

211,R. Hunter Greene,How old *is* this girl? And why does Humbert care?,7,2 February 2000,"Many people criticize Kubrick for taking 'excessive' liberties with Nabokov's novel and screenplay (though Nabokov himself was on the whole quite pleased with the final product, and spoke glowingly of the casting -- see Playboy interview with Nabokov, 1970). Clearly the film cannot begin to capture the tortured and tortuous interior monologues of the novel's narrator, but full credit is due to at least three of the film's stars -- Mason is absolutely brilliant as Humbert Humbert, Shelley Winters *is* the shrewish yet sympathetic Charlotte Haze, and Sellers clearly relishes his role as the shadowy Quilty (sure, the character is greatly expanded from the novel but I think that works, given that Nabokov drops so many subtle hints of Quilty's omnipresence). The weak link is Sue Lyons as the titular nymphet. She's way too old and (as other reviewers here have observed) lacks the requisite flirtatiousness which Nabokov's Humbert deems essential to the 'true nymphet.' 1962 is 1962, and, for the times, an 'older' Lolita may have been a safer (and prudential) departure from the 12 year old of the book. Still, Lyons looks so old that it's easy to forget that there's anything decidedly unseemly about her and Humbert together (a lurking unease which is impossible to escape in the novel). What is utterly lacking in Kubrick's adaptation, though, is any semblance of *why* refined, oh-so-European Humbert Humbert falls madly in love with this coarse little American girl. Nabokov's Humbert is a helpless, pitiable, yet sympathetic, victim -- a middle-aged man whose predilections are the product of his own arrested sexual development. None of this is present in Kubrick's characterization of Humbert, and the result is that we never fully understand what makes this guy tick. *What* seizes him when he first sees Lolita in the garden? The first half flows marvelously and has real sparkles of Nabokovian wit and Kubrick's genius -- the second half tends to drag (minus Mason's performance in the reunion scene with Lolita towards the end of the film). Even Kubrick nods.... Rating: 3 out of 4 stars (a full star for the performances of Mason, Winters, and Sellers).",Lolita

Lolita is no exception to that. It's a rather old film (52 years) that sets, like the book, in the 50s American nouveau-riche provincia and tells the uber-bekannt old-world story of pedophile Humbert-Humbert and Clare Quilty. Or the story of Dolores Haze, a minor, who falls in love and forms relations with the above mentioned two. The way Kubrick tells it, you can't necessarily come to one moral judgement or the other. It really is up to you to decide who's the ""villain"", if that's what you're after. The way he tells it is tragedy wrapped in comedy and quilted for decorative purposes. If men and women, old and young are all from the same planet, none of the Mars and Venus thing, than Lolita is the Guernica portraying that planet.

Thus, it only seemed fitting to watch Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation. Now, after the trouble (6 weeks, 4 stores, $40, and having to order it from out of the country) I went through to acquire this movie, I expected, or at least hoped, it'd be worth it. You can only imagine how disappointed I was! It's not that the film wasn't good. He stuck to Nobokov's script, stayed true to the story and had a decent cast. Rather, when I read the novel, I read it as a tragedy. It wasn't the story of a pedophile, but a tragic love story about a fragile, disturbed man hopelessly devoted to fantasies, unable to cope with reality. In reading the novel, I sympathized with poor Humbert Humbert, in fact, I cried for him. In the film, however, Humbert was portrayed as the monster he was. Rather than viewing his story in 1st person (as in the novel), it was viewed in 3rd person. Without walking around inside of Humbert's mind, it was next to impossible to connect, relate and compassionate with him; he was merely a two-dimensional pedophile. We're never aware of his thoughts, feelings, or his past. It was too hard to connect to him or view the conflicts in the story through the film.Anyways - it was a good adaptation but didn't capture the erotica or tragedy of the novel.",Lolita
217,cj1358,A different story,5,11 August 2013,"It's a good movie, actors' performance is decent, jokes are funny and so on... But it's not that ""Lolita"" I was desiring to see. It's just an ordinary movie, not that thing I expected to be made by such a master as Kubrick. We watch a very usual story with a bit of suddenness. Moreover, it is a very different story.Lolita's attitude to Humbert is too positive, she is kind of cold to him in the book, if speak about her in a few words. Her actions seem illogical in the movie. Especially the final one, that very disappearance with the ""uncle"". Seventeen years old Lolita, aka Mrs. Schiller, doesn't differ from the ""previous version"" anyhow, even though she was a different person in the end of the book, after all this sadness and hardship she mentioned. I remember that very moment in the novel when Lolita calls Humbert ""honey"" during their last talk. It was kind of flash of warm and joyful light for me then. I nearly felt it. THAT was HOW she changed. All in one word - that's the power of Nabokov's pen or whatever he wrote with. Movie awakens no feeling that can be named similar. At least Lolita's character doesn't.Humbert was a handsome man, a gentleman of Old Good Times in the book. He was attractive in many ways. And he was confident, and he was nearly almighty with his knowledge, charm and abilities. Movie's Humbert evokes only pity. I don't say Mason is bad, it's just not his character or his strange view of the role.Charlotta is all wrong in the movie. She's this kind of nearly village woman with her poor manners and behavior. She acted in a different way in the book, she was a woman of different qualities, who wouldn't scream and shout as mad in presence of anyone she wants to have good relationships with, for example.Plot is cut, events are mixed. I can't understand why Kubrick decided to make a movie by this novel. He failed in bringing ""Lolita"" to the screen, yet he succeeded in making a good film.",Lolita
218,raven2017,"Of the Greats, his Greatest",10,15 November 2004,"Kubrick was a phenomenal director; this much is certain. Yet consistently underrated is ""Lolita,"" which, in my mind, is his best direction job. Not before and seldom after was a director able to so deftly manipulate his/her audience's emotions so that the character with whom one's sympathies lay at the beginning of the movie was the character most despised by the end. For fans of beautiful, sweeping cinema like the Lord of the Rings or Star Wars trilogies, this movie is not for you. For those who require more than visual sweeps (perfectly-placed shots, genius use of shading and lighting, the ability to show ""just enough"" of the action to give you the point), you MUST see this movie; it ranks as one of the greatest ever made, certainly the greatest adaptation of a book (which, by the way, is second only to Milton's ""Paradise Lost"" as the greatest thing ever written IMHO).",Lolita
219,SPKlein52,Martin Amis has a great review of Lolita,10,11 August 2004,"No one says it better, so here is Martin Amis on 'Lolita':Like the sweat of lust and guilt, the sweat of death trickles through Lolita. I wonder how many readers survive the novel without realizing that its heroine is, so to speak, dead on arrival, like her child. Their brief obituaries are tucked away in the 'editor's' Foreword, in nonchalant, school-newsletter form: 'Mona Dahl' is a student in Paris. 'Rita' has recently married the proprietor of a hotel in Florida. Mrs. 'Richard F. Schiller' died in childbed, giving birth to a stillborn girl, on Christmas Day 1952, in Gray Star, a settlement in the remotest Northwest. 'Vivian Dark-bloom' has written a biography ...Then, once the book begins, Humbert's childhood love Annabel dies, at thirteen (typhus), and his first wife Valeria dies (also in childbirth), and his second wife Charlotte dies ('a bad accident'--though of course this death is structural), and Charlotte's friend Jean Farlow dies at thirty-three (cancer), and Lolita's young seducer Charlie Holmes dies (Korea), and her old seducer Quilty dies (murder: another structural exit). And then Humbert dies (coronary thrombosis). And then Lolita dies. And her daughter dies. In a sense Lolita is too great for its own good. It rushes up on the reader like a recreational drug more powerful than any yet discovered or devised. In common with its narrator, it is both irresistible and unforgivable. And yet it all works out. I shall point the way to what I take to be its livid and juddering heart--which is itself in prethrombotic turmoil, all heaves and lifts and thrills.Without apeing the explicatory style of Nabokov's famous Lectures (without producing height-charts, road maps, motel bookmatches, and so on),it might still be as well to establish what actually happens in Lolita: morally. How bad is all this--on paper, anyway? Although he distances himself with customary hauteur from the world of 'coal sheds and alleyways', of panting maniacs and howling policemen, Humbert Humbert is without question an honest-to-God, open-and-shut sexual deviant, displaying classic ruthlessness, guile and (above all) attention to detail. He parks the car at the gates of schoolyards, for instance, and obliges Lo to fondle him as the children emerge. Sixty-five cents secures a similar caress in her classroom, while Humbert admires a platinum classmate. Fellatio prices peak at four dollars a session before Humbert brings rates down 'drastically by having her earn the hard and nauseous way permission to participate in the school's theatrical programme'. On the other hand he performs complementary cunnilingus when his stepdaughter is laid low by fever: 'I could not resist the exquisite caloricity of unexpected delights--Venus febriculosa--though it was a very languid Lolita that moaned and coughed and shivered in my embrace.'Humbert was evidently something of a bourgeois sadist with his first wife, Valeria. He fantasized about 'slapping her breasts out of alignment' or 'putting on [his] mountain boots and taking a running kick at her rump' but in reality confined himself to 'twisting fat Valechka's brittle wrist (the one she had fallen upon from a bicycle)' and saying, 'Look here, you fat fool, c'est moi qui décide.' The weakened wrist is good: sadists know all about weakspots. Humbert strikes Lolita only once ('a tremendous backhand cut'), during a jealous rage, otherwise making do with bribes, bullying, and three main threats--the rural fastness, the orphanage, the reformatory:In plainer words, if we two are found out, you will be analysed and institutionalized, my pet, c'est tout. You will dwell, my Lolita will dwell (come here, my brown flower) with thirty-nine other dopes in a dirty dormitory (no, allow me, please) under the supervision of hideous matrons. This is the situation, this is the choice. Don't you think that under the circumstances Dolores Haze had better stick to her old man?It is true that Humbert goes on to commit murder: he kills his rival, Clare Quilty. And despite its awful comedy, and despite Quilty's worthlessness both as playwright and citizen, the deed is not denied its primal colorations. Quilty is Humbert's 'brother', after all, his secret sharer. Don't they have the same taste in wordplay and women? Don't they have the same voice? 'Drop that pistol,' he tells Humbert: 'Soyons raisonnables. You will only wound me hideously and then rot in jail while I recuperate in a tropical setting.' Quilty is a heartless japer and voyeur, one of the pornographers of real life. Most readers, I think, would assent to the justice of Humbert's last-page verdict: 'For reasons that may appear more obvious than they really are, I am opposed to capital punishment... Had I come before myself, I would have given Humbert at least thirty-five years for rape, and dismissed the rest of the charges.' Quilty's death is not tragic. Nor is Humbert's fate. Nor is Lolita. But Lolita is tragic, in her compacted span. If tragedy explores thwarted energy and possibility, then Lolita is tragic--is flatly tragic. And the mystery remains. How did Nabokov accommodate her story to this three-hundred-page blue streak--to something so embarrassingly funny, so unstoppably inspired, so impossibly racy?Literature, as has been pointed out, is not life; it is certainly not public life; there is no 'character issue'. It may be a nice bonus to know that Nabokov was a kind man. The biographical paraphernalia tells us as much. Actually, everything he wrote tells us as much. Lolita tells us as much. But this is not a straightforward matter. Lolita is a cruel book about cruelty. It is kind in the sense that your enemy's enemy is your friend, no matter how daunting his aspect. As a critic, Nabokov was more than averagely sensitive to literary cruelty. Those of us who toil through Cervantes, I suspect, after an initial jolt, chortlingly habituate ourselves to the 'infinite drubbings' meted out and sustained by the gaunt hidalgo. In his Lectures on Don Quixote, however, Nabokov can barely bring himself to contemplate the automatic 'thumbscrew' enormities of this 'cruel and crude old book':The author seems to plan it thus: Come with me, ungentle reader, who enjoys seeing a live dog inflated and kicked around like a soccer football; reader, who likes, of a Sunday morning, on his way to or from church, to poke his stick or direct his spittle at a poor rogue in the stocks; come... I hope you will be amused at what I have to offer.Nevertheless, Nabokov is the laureate of cruelty. Cruelty hardly exists elsewhere; all the Lovelaces and Osmonds turn out, on not very much closer inspection, to be mere hooligans and tyrants when compared to Humbert Humbert, to Hermann Hermann (his significant precursor) in Despair, to Rex and Margot in Laughter in the Dark, to Martha in King, Queen, Knave. Nabokov understood cruelty; he was wise to it; he knew its special intonations--as in this expert cadence from Laughter in the Dark, where, after the nicely poised 'skilfully', the rest of the sentence collapses into the cruel everyday:'You may kiss me,' she sobbed, 'but not that way, please.' The youth shrugged his shoulders ... She returned home on foot. Otto, who had seen her go off, thumped his fist down on her neck and then kicked her skilfully, so that she fell and bruised herself against the sewing-machine.Now Humbert is of course very cruel to Lolita, not just in the ruthless sine qua non of her subjugation, nor yet in his sighing intention of 'somehow' getting rid of her when her brief optimum has elapsed, nor yet in his fastidious observation of signs of wear in his 'frigid' and 'ageing mistress'. Humbert is surpassingly cruel in using Lolita for the play of his wit and the play of his prose--his prose, which sometimes resembles the 'sweat-drenched finery' that 'a brute of forty' may casually and legally shed (in both hemispheres, as a scandalized Humbert notes) before thrusting 'himself up to the hilt into his youthful bride'. Morally the novel is all ricochet or rebound. However cruel Humbert is to Lolita, Nabokov is crueller to Humbert--finessingly cruel. We all share the narrator's smirk when he begins the sexual-bribes chapter with the following sentence: 'I am now faced with the distasteful task of recording a definite drop in Lolita's morals.' But when the smirk congeals we are left staring at the moral heap that Humbert has become, underneath his arched eyebrow. Irresistible and unforgivable. It is complicated, and unreassuring. Even so, this is how it works.Lolita herself is such an anthology piece by now that even non-readers of the novel can close their eyes and see her on the tennis court or in the swimming pool or curled up in the car seat or the motel twin bed with her 'ridiculous' comics. We tend to forget that this blinding creation remains just that: a creation, and a creation of Humbert Humbert's. We have only Humbert's word for her. And whatever it is that is wrong with Humbert, not even his short-lived mother--'(picnic, lightning)'--would claim that her son was playing with a full deck. (Actually his personal pack may comprise the full fifty-two, but it is crammed with jokers and wild cards, pipless deuces, three-eyed queens.) A reliable narrator in the strict sense, Humbert is not otherwise reliable; and let us remember that Nabokov was capable of writing entire fictions-Despair, The Eye, Pale Fire--in which the narrators have no idea what is going on at all. Lolita, I believe, has been partly isolated and distorted by its celebrity. 'The greatest novel of rapture in modern fiction,' states the cover of the first Penguin, which also informs us, on the back, that Humbert is English.",Lolita
220,ErlendG,Kubrick misses the point of Nabokov's classic novel,6,7 March 2016,"""Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta. She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, standing four feet ten in one sock. She was Lola in slacks. She was Dolly at school. She was Dolores on the dotted line. But in my arms she was always Lolita."". Few novels can claim to have a better introduction than Vladimir Nabokov's 1955 novel. 'Lolita' was the Russian's love letter to the English language - a masterpiece in every sense. The topic would leave critics, who were yet to recover from the ""shock"" of the Catcher in the Rye, startled. The tagline of Kubrick's adaptation (NB! Nabokov never wrote the screenplay) was, and still is, ""How did they ever make a movie of Lolita?"". I'll tell you how - by removing most controversial aspects from the movie. The first mistake of the movie was changing Lolita's age from 12 to 16 years old. Understandable, but fatal. Sue Lyon's's otherwise flawless performance is underwhelmed by the fact that she isn't controversial enough. Lolita was supposed to be a novel exploring the darkness of a sexual predator, an active paedophile. Kubrick's film is a dark comedy, where crucial moments of the story are replaced by slapstick jokes. The cast of the movie poses further problems as well. While Shelley Winters shines as Charlotte Haze, James Mason is allowed to take the wrong directions throughout the movie. His character, Hubert Humbert is a sexual predator in the original novel, but both James Mason and Stanley Kubrick re-imagines the character as somewhat likable fellow who ""just loved Lolita"". This is wrong on so many levels. Peter Seller's, whom the movie mistakenly begins and ends with, is allowed to run rampage, as if Stanley Kubrick couldn't physically restrain him from the set. Seller's, a brilliant actor, is given too much focus (adding up to the ridiculous run-time of 2 hours and 32 minutes), and his presence undermines Mason's character completely. If one were to exclude the novel completely, 'Lolita' can be considered a decent film. Certainly not amongst Kubrick's finest, but a film with fine cinematic qualities nevertheless. Clever scene transitions with the help of cinematographer Oswald, and a catchy theme from Bob Harries makes parts of the movie enjoyable. I give 'Lolita' 6/10 stars, in other words - average. Kubrick was never known for making good adaptations (Stephen King hates The Shining), and this is a testament to one of his few flaws.",Lolita
221,vindileelou,Excellent Film,10,8 January 2005,Just amazing! I was pinned to my chair the whole time watching this film. James Mason had me spellbound with this performance. The tension between James Mason and Peter Sellers in real life made the characters pop off the screen. Trivia: John Mason was not happy at the fact that Peter Sellers got to do so much improv in his scenes. By doing the inprov John Mason thought Peter Sellers was stealing the scene from him. I have not seen many Peter Seller's movies (outside of the Pink Panther and Dr. Strangelove) but intend to watch more of them after seeing him in Lolita. Sue Lyon was perfect as Lolita. Her kid like quality and little quirks made a convincing character. I had seen Sue Lyon in 7 Women with Anne Bancroft when I was a kid. It was good watching her again. I recommend this film.,Lolita
222,dawodchatha,Beautiful Film with a Hidden Ending,10,31 January 2014,"The beauty of this film is quite obvious and is only offset by critics who don't appreciate Kubrick's art in the form of scandal. This review is going to focus on the hidden ending of Lolita that everyone has missed, except me.Kubrick's Lolita has a hidden genius ending that highly contrasts the appeared ending. The ending of Lolita appears to be the same beginning scene of Humbert killing Quilty but ending with a cut after Humbert calls for Quilty's name. However, the hidden fact is that the beginning scene and the ending scene are not the same. The two scenes were filmed differently, watch the film again if you are not convinced. Kubrick could have easily copied and pasted the beginning scene to the end and cut it when Humbert calls for Quilty's name, but he doesn't. Kubrick uses two different scenes to show one dream and one reality. The beginning scene of Humbert killing Quilty is a future dream of Humbert's and the ending scene is the reality. The ending leaves Humbert without Lolita and without finding Quilty. It is deeply beautiful. My explanation to why Humbert was dreaming in the beginning scene is below.If you analyze the film, you will see Humbert basically act the same scene out but in reality he doesn't. In the ending scene the chair Quilty was sitting in is covered in a different fashion, he doesn't string the harp and he calls out Quilty's name at different timings. First, the covering of the chair is significant because the beginning scene can clearly make out a body and also has a beer bottle resting on the Quilty's head. In contrast, the ending scene has a sheet on the chair that can not clearly make out an entire body and has a beer bottle resting at the lap of the chair. This shows that Quilty was not present at the end, which is supported by the beer bottle clearly showing Quilty's body. Second, the stringing of the harp in the beginning scene, in comparison with not stringing it in the end, hints that Humbert is in a dream. Third, the difference in the timing of the shot is significant because Kubrick carefully edits the ending frame so that Humbert is covering up the chair Quility is supposed to be sitting in and fades out the film to an end. This is significant because Kubrick is trying to subliminally show the audience that Humbert did not find Quilty.The epilogue does say Humbert dies during the trial of his murder of Quilty, but I believe Kubrick puts that in there to misdirect the audience to the actual ending. He is a genius. The epilogue is read over the shot painting that he supposedly shot Quilty through. This is really important because the same painting was shown in both the beginning and ending scene as Humbert enters the house. Also the painting represents Lolita who is a liar and Kubrick is trying to tell the intelligent audience that he is lying about Humbert killing Quilty. In addition, the beginning scene is followed by Humbert narrating, showing the beginning of reality. The ending scene leaves Humbert calling for Quilty but getting no response, showing that he did not end up finding Quilt and obviously did not end up with Lolita. The ending is truly beautiful.",Lolita
223,yearning_ghost,"I liked it, with or without ""Peter Sellers"".",7,24 October 2006,"I enjoyed this film immensely, even though it did drag for the last little bit. Shelley Winters - was she born to play a broad or what? - was excellent and funny as the Desperate Housewife, lonely and with delusions of class. Our teenage nymphet was suitably cynical, with just the right touch of teenage brat thrown in for realism.I especially loved the dark humor throughout the film. I won't quote anything, but I laughed out loud in a couple of places. I had no idea this was going to happen and was surprised by it.Watch Marion Mathie, the nosy neighbor who comes over to tell Humbert and Lolita to quiet down. She's only on for a few minutes but she steals the scene. You see, she's ""entertaining, and one of my guests is a minister of the church, you see.."".I've never read the book but I am aware of it, so I can't compare the book or the film, but of course I understand that it had to be watered down due to censorship of the day, but if you don't get that 'they are having an affair' then what do YOU think is going on? In fact, that's why I like some of the older films: it's not in-your-face but it doesn't need to be.I recommend seeing it at least once, maybe even a second time if you miss any of the jokes.About the subject line: several reviews here claim Peter Sellers is in this film. He isn't.",Lolita
